00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Since Reggie Fils-Aime departed Nintendo, he's been shattering the dreams of many fandoms. Yours truly was gutted, but not surprised to hear that Nintendo doesn't see the value in investing in Mother 3, the Game Boy Advance sequel to Mother 2, known in the West as Earthbound. The good news is, this is only what he knows about since his time at Nintendo. Feelings change, thoughts develop, and time keeps ticking. Oh, and tonight's story is about F-Zero. Put on your fandom dream

00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
hardhats and tune in for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki as they discuss the story and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined via the magic of Discord by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hi.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hello, hello. How are you doing?

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Um, that's a loaded question.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hope you're feeling better this week than last week.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My head is and then I probably broke my toe last night.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, no. Alright, I want to talk about your weekend a little more in a minute.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
More about that.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Of course I want to introduce Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hello.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hi, what is the game playing behind you tonight live on Twitch?

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's weird.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, here's here's my plug. I always do it because we do a tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's VOG network. Nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Again, that's twitch.tv slash vog network where a lot of viewers tonight are surprised to find out that I have no hair under the hat.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So usually I wear a hat while we're doing the show. I'm not wearing one this week and everybody's like Rob looks different.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, because I'm not wearing a hat and you're like, oh, you have a very symmetrical head, Rob.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, actually, I would say the headphones really bring it out when I'm wearing these big old headphones.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They kind of bring that out.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I usually like being bald because I feel like it isn't symmetric.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But thank you. I know people who are very lumpy.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You don't you do not look lumpy.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you. Thank you.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
DJ Rama S and chat says Rob is a sexy Lex Luther.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, thank you. Except Lex Luther is what I've been calling the guy who just bought Twitter.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I don't really want I don't want to be associated with that guy.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That guy's that guy's a piece of work. Anyway, Loki.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Remember who it was, though, that compared you to Vin Diesel.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But you know, that was on Twitter. Yeah. Yeah.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I would have been insulted.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I look at where that is not attractive.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry. Well, somebody replied to my think.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So I posted a selfie and I was like, hi, bald.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And somebody replied to it, putting high graying.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And I was like, is that supposed to be shady? Because, A, you've never posted a selfie.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So if you want me to drag you, I'm happy to do it.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But B, I don't know, like Anderson Cooper's graying and he's kind of hot.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So like, what's wrong with graying? Gray's cool.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So great. Gray is we call that a silver fox.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes. Gray is a sign of intelligence and maturity.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Gray is a sign that your melanin levels have decreased in your hair follicles.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Anyway. Well, speaking of, you know, maturity.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Welcome to the video game show that we've been doing for coming up on 20 years next month.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And Loki, you look like you have a very mature game playing in the background behind you there.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What is that? It's like I know I've played this before and I can't remember the name of this.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It is. I didn't know what the picks.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So I just did arcade long plays and then I saw this on the list. It's ninja clowns.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I think this is one of those like main games I've played just for the name.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I was like, what the hell is this? And I played it for like five minutes and I was like, it's not very good.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
All right. It appears to be a beat him up with clowns.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So that that sounds frightening and terrible unless you're the one beating up the clowns.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, I don't even want to look at one.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I think it's like looks like you're a clown beating up other things.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hmm. Interesting. Perhaps. All right. Let's talk about something that's a brighter topic.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Dark soccer. You were on a trip this weekend, right? Sort of.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Not really a trip. I mean, the place is 30 minutes away.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
A jaunt, a skip, a hop and a skip.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So I was in Lodi. Yeah.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I know. What's in Lodi?

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Lodi is where good wine comes from, though.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Well, anyway, speaking of wine, it was at the the Wine Festival Center or whatever they call it, their convention center.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But we had the triumphant return of Golden State Pinball Festival.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And I went on Friday for a good portion of it.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Friday is it starts later in the afternoon. So I went and played a bunch of stuff and hung out with Dan.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He was on the channel Elk Grove Pinball here on on Twitch and doing commentating on the the various tournaments that they were running.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He was actually on today's tournament and I kept hosting it.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But that was pretty that was pretty fun.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We went to a dinner also that night in memory of a member of the community and a friend of ours who died very suddenly this past year.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And his wife was there. And, you know, we she made cookies for everybody. It was nice.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I didn't eat them because they had raisins in them. But overall, I had a really good time.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I went again last night and I was supposed to be there today for the last day, except in doing my laundry and trying to kick the door open, I kicked the door frame.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And yeah, last night my my toe was was purple and swollen.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Today it is actually toe colored, but it's still pretty swollen.

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And I had it had actually swollen into my rapping last night and it hurts so much.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So now I have it. I mean, what are you going to do for a broken toe?

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You know, the doctors can say, OK, it's broken, immobilize it. Here's some drugs, except I can't take any of the drugs because of other stuff I'm on.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So I just I taped it. I put gauze around it to give it a cushion.

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I taped the two toes together with Katie tape. I've taken Tylenol. I've taken a muscle relaxer. I'm good.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm not laughing at the fact you broke your toe because that sucks. But I'm laughing because my assumption was at some point during the weekend, you kicked a pinball machine or something.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I didn't think you were doing it with laundry or I thought, oh, maybe they had an ultra cayed machine there and she kicked it out of ceremony.

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It was my pinky to Brad. It's no fun. That's no fun.

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And actually, I think the one next to it, it was pretty, pretty tender, too.

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But so I'm just going to keep him taped up and let him heal.

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And but as but as a result, I didn't want to be on my foot all day playing pinball as much as I wanted to go back and play the star of the show, in my opinion, which was they had Weird Al's Museum of Natural Hilarity.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And I played a lot of it. I love it, except it has the same problem with P3 tables that it always has.

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
First of all, this one had the animatronic with the squeeze box and everything. It was really cool.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It is a very fun table with many, many modes. Like you actually when you hit a mode, you get to choose between two of them.

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Like I did Weasel Stomping Day and and Harvey the Winter Hamster.

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And then Dan got a choice between I'll sue you. And what was the other one?

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He got word crimes, which I wish he had done word crimes, but whatever. And it was is really fun.

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But my problem with P3 tables is that because it's a smoother surface, that it doesn't have the same drag that a traditional wooden playfield has, that sometimes the ball physics are affected weirdly.

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Like the ball will sometimes move slower than I anticipated moving, and sometimes it will just move like lightning.

95
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The other problem I have with P3 flippers, and this one was better than like when I played Lexi Lightspeed a while back, is that they seem to have a wider gap and a slight bit of a delay.

96
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But now with this one, though, I don't know what they did, but they had, I guess, 3D printed an extension for the the flipper buttons and there were three buttons.

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I only played with, you know, the ones I reached normally.

98
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But I mean, it's got a very involved playfield for, you know, a P3. You've got, I mean, still you have that open...

99
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Question from Chad on what a P3 is.

100
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh, my apologies. So P3 is a modular pinball system.

101
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So what it is, is you have an LCD screen inside that plays and interacts with your targets and various things.

102
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The Weird Al one in particular, and I think, actually, I think all of them have this, have like these little raised areas that will come up between the video part of the playfield and the back end of the playfield.

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And usually that's where like underpieces go, like for ball captures or different modes. Right.

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But you can change out the parts on it and change the kit.

105
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I guess it's like a board on it that you can change out and have it be a different table.

106
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And these kits are, depending on like the base model itself is something like, I want to say eight grand.

107
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And then you can get different kits for anywhere, I think between like three to seven.

108
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And then we have, we were getting the Deluxe Weird Al machine.

109
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So we also are getting an animatronic, but buying the machine, buying the kit, even with it installed in the animatronic edition is about twelve thousand dollars for us.

110
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So we've sold tables to acquire it. It's very novel.

111
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I mean, when we first saw it, we were sort of skeptical about it.

112
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh, this won't really go anywhere.

113
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They had another one that I didn't play called Valhalla. A lot of people spoke very highly of that.

114
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I didn't play it because honestly, I was like, I'll play Weird Al. I'll play a lot of Weird Al.

115
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But there's like, there's Lexi Lightspeed, there's Valhalla, there's Weird Al.

116
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There is, there's another one that I can never think of.

117
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I think it's like a Western themed one. And I always want to say that Total Heist is the other one.

118
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And thank you, Bobby. And I always used to want to think that Total Nuclear Annihilation was one of them.

119
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's a completely different table that it was mean to me and I don't want to play it again.

120
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But the Weird Al table is amazing. It even has Harvey the Wonder Hamster running in his little wheel.

121
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And has the UHF cameras and everything and TV and all of just the little neat bits and pieces.

122
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And so many call-outs. Like, you just hear Al talking the whole time.

123
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And I didn't even hear everything he had to say.

124
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And like, when you hit a drop target or something, it makes like a boiling or, you know, little comedic cartoony crashing noises and things like that.

125
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's very well thought out. I would say it's probably as well, if not better, thought out than many dedicated cabinets.

126
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So, very well done. I put some stuff up on TikTok, I think, of me videoing ginging other people playing it.

127
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And also me complaining about the guy that wouldn't shut up about playfield repair while I was doing multi-ball and Black Knight sort of rage.

128
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Do not talk to me while I'm playing pinball. End of story.

129
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Mr. Joe 100 Mountain Chat says, I was super jealous of Jamie's pinball pics when she was posting. It looked like a lot of fun.

130
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, it looks like a fun event. I really should have gone. I didn't even know it was this weekend until I saw your tweet, retweets of your TikTok.

131
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And I was like, oh, no, it was the picture of a long friend of mine from way back that you saw.

132
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh, Amanda.

133
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And then I was like, where did they run into each other? Did she go to the Bay Area this weekend?

134
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And then I saw Amanda's Facebook that she was volunteering at the pinball thing and I was like, oh, of course, that's where.

135
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And Dan said that she beelined for him to find me and I was coming in later in the day.

136
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I actually ended up there a little bit later than I wanted to.

137
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But I really should have gone if she was there.

138
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, it was really good catching up with Amanda. I mean, it's been, gosh, I think like not long after her wedding.

139
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That was a while ago.

140
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
A while ago. I mean, I think I saw her at a couple of other things, but it's been a while.

141
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But I'm checking out my pictures real quick just so I can remember everything that I played.

142
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I was I took another guy to their wedding because I was dating him at the time and Alan and I have been together for like 12 years.

143
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So, yeah.

144
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But I played Bride of Pinbot 2.0.

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Do you know that is? Oh, yeah.

146
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, I love I love the music in it and how they updated, you know, with the color DMD and everything.

147
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's it's very worthwhile.

148
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I love the machine with the color dot matrix displays.

149
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I didn't play their Twilight Zone because I own one, but someone had a modded back glass that was semi holographic or lenticular with glowing LEDs behind it.

150
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I played Rush. I played a decent amount of Rush.

151
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I actually played the auctioned version because the room was much quieter.

152
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That was the room that had like the 60s and 70s pinball, including a Fritz the Cat one.

153
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I didn't know that they did one. Oh, wow.

154
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But it was fun to play that one because I couldn't hear the other ones.

155
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I played Avengers. That one was pretty fun. But again, I couldn't hear it.

156
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's my weird TikTok video. I played Alien Star, which is a probably early 80s, late 70s.

157
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It was when they started doing the digital.

158
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Counters, I played Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, and that was fucking fun.

159
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That was great. I loved it. I wanted the Rob Zombie one was right next to it and it looked great.

160
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Had a deep playfield and everyone was just on top of it. I played a gladiator, which is a Gottlieb table.

161
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I played the Pabst can crusher.

162
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What the hell is that?

163
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Like Pabst blue ribbon.

164
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Wow. Okay. I had no idea that was the thing.

165
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I also got a good picture of the rig they had set up for the tournament for a streaming pinball.

166
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, that's a picture of my key breaking off in the lock. That also happened.

167
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I also played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It had lots of neat mods on it.

168
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Just different figures and custom items. It was inside an inflatable tent.

169
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It looks almost like a bounce house from the outside. Apparently this guy's son made this thing.

170
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And then it was nice and cool inside to play Turtles. It was awesome. I'll put pictures up of that.

171
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I played Space Invaders pinball. I played Star Trek. I played Pac-Man.

172
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I played this really weird game called Future Spa. It is definitely 60s, early 70s-ish aesthetic.

173
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Was it all pinball there?

174
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It was all pinball.

175
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If you go to the Pinball Hall of Fame in Vegas, they still have a good collection of 80s and 90s arcade machines too.

176
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
One row is all that. But it was purely pinball, this thing.

177
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Pure pinball. This year it was all pinball. I played the Incredible Hulk from the 70s.

178
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I played, like I said, I played Bride of Pimbat. I played Transformers, the newer one. I bought a beer stein.

179
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
These are all private collectors that bring these in, basically, right?

180
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Did you and Dan take any of yours?

181
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And Stern. No, we didn't bring any of ours.

182
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Stern brought in a bunch of demos. They brought in Godzilla, which I didn't play.

183
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They brought in Avengers. They brought in Rush. They brought in...

184
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
There wasn't actually a big Jersey Jack showing, which actually surprised me a little bit.

185
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I was hoping that Jersey Jack would have brought in some stuff.

186
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I think the only of theirs I saw was a dialed in.

187
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And there might have been the Lord of the Rings. I might have missed it.

188
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But these are all the pictures of my food.

189
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I was trying to see what else I played.

190
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So many pictures of Weird Al. I was on that table like you would not believe.

191
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Avengers Infinity Quest. Early next year, right?

192
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I think mid next year, actually.

193
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I also know that I played...

194
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh, yeah. We were hoping that there would be Stranger Things.

195
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And there wasn't.

196
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But I did also play a machine that I used to own.

197
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I used to own PENbot, Brighter PENbot, and Jackbot.

198
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But we don't have those anymore.

199
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So I spent a little bit of time with Jackbot, re-familiarizing myself.

200
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh, and I played Munsters. The black and white Munsters deluxe that has the mini...

201
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's basically Grandpa's lab.

202
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And it's a mini play field with a tiny little pinball.

203
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And you play it and it's pretty fun.

204
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
If there's a version to have, there's that one.

205
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But for other tables that they had there, they had a lot of...

206
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh, yeah. I played the old Pac-Man one from the early 80s.

207
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Which is not very good.

208
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
No baby Pac-Man. I looked.

209
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That one's a weird one, though, because it's half video game, right?

210
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So it lives in a weird place.

211
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I played Sword of Fury, which honestly has amazing music.

212
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That's cool.

213
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's around the same era as Black Knight 2000.

214
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,000
There's also several Black Knights, a Black Knight 2000 and a Black Knight Sword of Rage,

215
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
which is the one I got irritated playing.

216
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
For the tournaments, though, they had a World Cup soccer,

217
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
which actually belongs to a friend and coworker.

218
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We didn't bring ours. There were no other World Cups out on the field.

219
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And that was actually the one they did the finals for today's tournament.

220
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And I felt bad because the ball kept sticking in this one place,

221
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
apparently like a wire or a rubber on it broke or something.

222
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But they also had an Iron Maiden for that.

223
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
They had ACDC.

224
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Godzilla was another one of the tournament tables.

225
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'd have to go back and think about it,

226
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
but they had a really diverse showing for the tournament tables.

227
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Let me ask you this, because I know we want to get into the gaming news here,

228
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
but I'm curious how, because it's been a couple of years,

229
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
because obviously COVID shut down things for a while,

230
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
how well attended did it seem to you?

231
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Did it seem like people were ready for this to be back?

232
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah.

233
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The thing, though, that I liked, and it was actually by necessity,

234
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
is that the floor outlets in,

235
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
because basically the convention center has a huge gymnasium area,

236
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and then another convention room,

237
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and then a smaller convention room where the tourney was,

238
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
but the big gym area and the other room, the medium-sized room,

239
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
the floor outlets couldn't handle four tables.

240
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So they actually put the tables around the outside walls

241
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and then a couple of lines of them.

242
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And for me, well, and for the ones they could get on those multi-outlets,

243
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
they had them spread out in such a way that I think that it was honestly

244
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
about as safe as it could get.

245
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And there were people masked, there were people not masked,

246
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
you know, kind of a mix.

247
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They were more unmasked than masked, and of course when I got,

248
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
actually this morning I took a test and it came back negative.

249
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So, but it was pretty well attended.

250
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Maybe not as much as I've seen there for the past shows,

251
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
but people were ready for it, and they didn't have a big vending presence.

252
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I mean, Marco Pinball's was there, and a few people doing pinball parts,

253
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and I think the pinball room was there.

254
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And then Stern has the Stern Insider thing now where you have a barcode,

255
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and anyone can sign up for it, but they have a barcode scanner on,

256
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
not a barcode, but a QR code scanner on the table.

257
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And if the owner of that table has registered it,

258
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
then you scan the QR code from your phone,

259
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and it tracks your scores on the leaderboard.

260
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's cool.

261
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So that is really, that was a smart way to incorporate it.

262
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's neat to see that modern stuff that pinball's doing to really stay,

263
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
you know, because I know it's video games here at OLR,

264
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
but pinball is super adjacent to that,

265
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and I think a lot of people have that cross interest and so forth,

266
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and I think it's neat to see because, you know, whereas we've seen arcades,

267
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I think, really regress for many of us,

268
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
because we all joke that arcades are nothing but ticket-spitting machines

269
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
teaching kids how to gamble these days.

270
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You know, arcades, from what we remember and what we miss,

271
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
you know, they're pretty garbage, but pinball feels like it's still a thing.

272
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's still there.

273
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's still in bars and, you know, a lot of coin-op arcades,

274
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
you know, throughout the country and so forth,

275
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
it's still able to kind of progress in these different ways.

276
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's pretty cool.

277
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And then obviously, you know, people have a lot of love for shows like this.

278
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I bought you a mug.

279
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Oh, what about, I can't wait to see it, what about like California Extreme?

280
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Speaking of upcoming shows, is that still a thing?

281
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Is that coming back?

282
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The organizer of California Extreme was there.

283
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh, nice.

284
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And I also met a lady who was staffing here,

285
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
who also staffs for California Extreme, and it's definitely happening.

286
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
With my luck, I'll be hosting a show that weekend.

287
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Oh, July 30th and 31st is when it is.

288
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah.

289
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Oh, tentative date.

290
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That's interesting.

291
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
They still don't have that locked down.

292
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Interesting.

293
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Well, I think that, honestly, I think it is locked, from what I understand.

294
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Maybe with COVID cases going up in the bay, they're still a little skittish.

295
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah.

296
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I think that's it.

297
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But...

298
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Anyway, before we get to kickoff news,

299
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
any other quick wrap up thoughts on the pinball thing?

300
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We had, there were people actually from all over that were there.

301
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
One of the tournament players drove down from Boise.

302
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We had one of our Reno buddies win the novice tournament.

303
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
We had players from San Francisco.

304
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We had people come from all over to come to this convention.

305
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's a beautiful Lodi.

306
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Whoa.

307
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Lodi is kind of picturesque in that we're a small town.

308
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's still considered just part of Sacramento, I think.

309
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Well, okay.

310
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Well, here's the thing.

311
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Here's the thing.

312
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
One of the most famous people from Sacramento, they just named a park after him.

313
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
They gave him a star.

314
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
LeVar Burton, right?

315
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
One of the most famous people from Sacramento.

316
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
An actual living legend.

317
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Amazing actor, right?

318
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
He's really from Gull.

319
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But it's...

320
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah.

321
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
They just say Sacramento.

322
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
He's really from Galt, but they just say Sacramento.

323
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That's where Galt is.

324
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Like you sneeze driving to Lodi and Galt's missing.

325
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah, Galt between Lodi and Sac.

326
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But anyway, I'm not going to bore our international audience with local geography.

327
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And where I live, it really was like a 20 to 30 minute drive, depending on the traffic.

328
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah.

329
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It wasn't bad at all.

330
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And, you know, it was really good just reconnecting with people that I haven't seen in a while.

331
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And Dan said people were surprised to see me.

332
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I mean, I know I'm pretty much the recluse when it comes.

333
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I don't go to the pinball tournaments because I was either working or streaming or to league

334
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
nights.

335
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And honestly, that's a lot of people in small places, especially when it's at my house.

336
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But, you know, I'm also not competitive that way.

337
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So I don't really care about being in a competitive environment.

338
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But I like I generally genuinely like most of the people.

339
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And also Dan's co-host for the Spinner is Lit podcast, which is the podcast that he's

340
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
on.

341
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Spencer, he and his wife, Rusty, moved out of state, but they came back for this.

342
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So we got to see Spencer and Rusty and got to see all kinds of just, you know, it was

343
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
the reconnection, the pinball community in and of itself.

344
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's just really a.

345
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't know, it's very different than I guess your standard arcade communities and that

346
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,000
it's somewhat competitive feeling, but also when you're done, there's not really hard

347
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
feelings.

348
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And then if there are hard feelings, they fade pretty quickly.

349
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I mean, the various drama, there is drama in our local community, but most of the time,

350
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
people are just like, just hang in and chill.

351
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It reminds me of what this show is founded on the DDR community, like a lot of what you

352
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
just said can be said about the DDR community that, you know, at tournaments and stuff,

353
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
people are cool.

354
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Like, you know, it's like, OK, a different person won.

355
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's whatever.

356
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But then there were certain individuals within it that were very dramatic.

357
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And, you know, of all about the drama, the drama llamas, you know, and all that.

358
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But for the most part, like, you know, obviously this show exists because of that community.

359
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And even though we've all moved on from it.

360
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Well, because the community died.

361
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You know, now it's now to be fair for somebody, you know, reacts to what I just said.

362
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I realized that newer Konami efforts in the arcade has kind of brought the the Bahmani

363
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and music game scene back.

364
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But I think people need to understand that since we started the show in 2002, there was

365
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
that real gap between the time Extreme came out and Supernova came out that, you know,

366
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Konami killed Bahmani for a lot of people, you know, in that kind of drought time.

367
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So it took a long time for it to come back, I think.

368
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So, you know, I'm just saying the DDR community died.

369
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
News reborn as we were reborn.

370
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's different now because of the pandemic, because Discord brings people together instead

371
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
of DDR freak.

372
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Just different, you know.

373
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah.

374
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So honestly, for me, Twitch is like my old AOL chat.

375
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I mean, seriously, I was I mean, that's how I met Dan.

376
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So actually, it's how I met a number of my Bahmani friends before.

377
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Like, I was playing BM 98 on a Windows 3.1 machine.

378
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Are you saying if I had been on AOL instead of Prodigy?

379
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Are you saying if I've been on AOL that no matter what chat room I decided to go to,

380
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
you would be in there already chatting?

381
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Because that's what happens on Twitch.

382
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
No matter what.

383
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The thing is, you would probably have ended up in the same circles because that's just

384
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
where all of the video game anime nerds went to.

385
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I don't know.

386
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
A lot of my gay friends say that AOL for them was very different.

387
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And I never experienced any of that because I didn't figure things out until a little

388
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
later in life.

389
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And we had moved on to the internet was out.

390
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Gay.com.

391
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Anyway, let's move on quickly.

392
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Let's get into another.

393
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Thank you for the wrap up at the gaming expo, the pinball expo.

394
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Makes me jealous.

395
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And I think I want to go to California extreme because July 30th, I was just looking at that

396
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
for an Ingress event.

397
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But the Ingress event is in Germany and a plane ticket to Germany.

398
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Are you not going to drive to Germany?

399
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yeah, I'm going to drive to Germany, Logie.

400
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
A plane ticket to Germany right now.

401
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I was like, oh, maybe it's like $1,600.

402
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I was like, never mind.

403
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'll just not do that event.

404
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And I will just do something else.

405
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So anyway, we'll do California extreme maybe.

406
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
All right.

407
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But let's get into some news.

408
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's interesting.

409
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I just brought up DDR and the good old days and Konami because there's a lot of great

410
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Konami stuff from the good old days, lots of franchises.

411
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And honestly, I don't think any of them are ever going to come back as good as they were.

412
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't know.

413
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
A lot of people speak fondly of Bomberman and people speak fondly of the Castlevania

414
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
collections, which are fine, but they're literally just ports of good games.

415
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You know, they're just they're just ports of good games.

416
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I have concerns about where this next one is going.

417
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Logie, would you like to talk about the latest that the rumor that won't die, but somebody

418
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
put gasoline on the fire this week?

419
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah.

420
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So there is a well-known leaker by the name of Dusk Golem had shared some images of what's

421
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
supposed to be a Silent Hill game.

422
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It looks like concept art.

423
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And then, of course, you know, normally we would just say, oh, yeah, of course.

424
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Yeah, sure.

425
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Silent Hill.

426
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
But then Konami cease and desisted it and took it off the Internet.

427
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So, of course, you know, the Internet, yes, basically confirming it to the entire Internet,

428
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
this little this little thing we call the Streisand effect.

429
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Right.

430
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We all know the Streisand effect.

431
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
For those that have not heard the term before, you might think, why did they name something

432
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
after Barbra Streisand?

433
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Because she had pictures of her house taken, like from an airplane or something like that.

434
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't know.

435
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Paparazzi flew over her house, took pictures.

436
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
She sued the website or whatever was the magazine or whatever, trying to get the pictures

437
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
taken down.

438
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And the pictures were removed, but not before they were spread and published everywhere

439
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
on the Internet.

440
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Because, you know, you know how it goes.

441
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Tigerclaw just said it in chat.

442
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Once it's on the Internet, it stays on the Internet.

443
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And absolutely true for the Silent Hill League.

444
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But you see, Konami isn't run by competent people anymore.

445
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That is that is a fact.

446
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That is a fact.

448
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Konami is not run by competent people anymore.

449
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And before you start to go, but the arcade scene, OK, the arcade division is different

450
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:44,000
from this this rotting husk zombie of what used to be K-Set and the home entertainment

451
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
division.

452
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
OK, that is a fucking disaster.

453
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And I'm sorry.

454
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
That is fact, because I'm just going to point at this E football.

455
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm just going to point at E football.

456
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Fat.

457
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm going to point at that hard contra, whatever that game was called, contra hardcore.

458
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It was called fat bomber man.

459
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
OK, maybe less of a fact.

460
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But how many years ago was that at this point?

461
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Like reading more recent like examples that like Konami making games for the whole is

462
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
is like this is not good news.

463
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That's that Konami is making a new Silent Hill unless unless and this is the only way

464
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm going to get excited about it.

465
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
They've roped somebody else.

466
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They gave the intellectual property to somebody else.

467
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
But Konami is still the one that shut it down.

468
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So I'm a little worried about that.

469
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's outsourcing it to Kojima.

470
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I doubt that they already think they know who's doing it, but I'll let I'll let Loki

471
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
finish.

472
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Sorry.

473
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah.

474
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So.

475
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yeah, I don't I don't think Kojima would be doing that kind of stuff.

476
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I don't know if we know who's actually working on this, but it looks interesting.

477
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It doesn't look like a Silent Hill game.

478
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I mean, like anything I've seen for Silent Hill game right now.

479
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So I believe the studio is blooper or something like that.

480
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What's the no, it's not blooper.

481
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Somebody in chat saved me here.

482
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
That there's they think they know what studio is working on.

483
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It's been it's been talked about before.

484
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Blooper.

485
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I was close.

486
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Blooper.

487
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah.

488
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Blooper is the team that's rumored to be working on it.

489
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm trying to see what else it is they did.

490
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I think they were the ones that did the Blair Witch reboot.

491
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yeah, they did Blair Witch.

492
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
They did the medium observer layers of fear.

493
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So they media the medium certainly looks like, you know, they've done other OK, scary games.

494
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Well, the medium.

495
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I mean, that was the one that everyone was convinced was a Silent Hill game originally.

496
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So, I mean, they can certainly nail the style.

497
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
True.

498
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And what was interesting, too, about the leak is that a lot of folks noticed that it was a lot of British terms that were on like the little Post-it notes.

499
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And people are thinking that if it's a reboot, it's potentially like a Europe Silent Hill.

500
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Whereas most of this, in fact, I think all of the Silent Hill that we've seen today is, you know, America based.

501
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It was all the whole thing was based off a coal town in Virginia.

502
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So like that, you know, still smolders after all these years.

503
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And so it'd be interesting if they move it to a British kind of location.

504
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But it's an interesting way to reboot it.

505
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So I don't I don't I feel nothing about that.

506
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
OK, it's just show me the game.

507
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:42,000
But what's interesting about it is it seems like there's like a bullying theme to it because like the little pieces of paper that are ripped away in her face, like one of them says, I hate myself.

508
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And then you see in all the Post-it notes that are decorated the hallway, it says something like, you know, like, you know, just just bully like you're fat.

509
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
You know, things things like bully terms that they'd say.

510
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And so people think it could involve like a bullying thing.

511
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So I don't know.

512
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I mean, we'll see what we see whenever they decide they actually want to reveal this.

513
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But them taking down these images just confirmed it.

514
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So a new Silent Hill game is or was and that's important to is or was being worked on.

515
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
There's no guarantee it'll see the light of day. Hello, P.T.

516
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But it seems it's even actually Silent Hill.

517
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Yeah, or yeah, or even actually turns into an actual Silent Hill game. Very true.

518
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Loud Mountain, who knows? No, I don't know.

519
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So Loud Mountain be Loud Valley if you're going for opposite.

520
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
OK, fair enough. Loud Valley.

521
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So, yeah, we'll see.

522
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I don't know, but it's it seems like it's happening and it's just going to now, you know, if it ends up being a Sony exclusive or whatever, it just really amps up the pressure on Sony.

523
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I don't know. I say that, but it's like Sony could do whatever they want when it comes to announcements.

524
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Like if they announce it, great. If they don't, whatever.

525
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Because I think a lot of us are just like sick of talking about Silent Hill.

526
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Like it's been literally how many years since the P.T. demo?

527
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Like the P.T. demo is just about eligible to be a classic game of the week, I believe. It's been a long time.

528
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So I think people are just kind of like sick of speculating a Silent Hill game and it's like just just come out already.

529
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So I think the last Silent Hill games were 10 years ago.

530
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I think Downpour was 2012 and the HD collection.

531
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So which speaking of a disaster anyway.

532
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
All right. Other comments from chat.

533
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Dr. Seuss says that's where I'm at. If they outsourced it to someone competent, it could be good.

534
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yeah. I mean, when the talk was Hideo Kojima was somehow back and involved, that was very exciting.

535
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But now that was never going to be their team putting it together because they don't have a competent team at that company.

536
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
No, that's very true. Tiger class says it's unfortunate Konami is sitting on a bunch of IPs and doing nothing with them.

537
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah, pretty much. I mean, rereleasing the hits.

538
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,000
That's that's what they're doing right now. They're rereleasing the hits because when it comes to the Castlevania collection, the arcade collection.

539
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Now we have the Ninja Turtles collection that's coming. That is very it's that's pretty much a Konami thing, right?

540
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It's pretty much all their games that came out. They're just rehashing the hits. They're repackaging the oldies.

541
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Repackaging the hits. Yeah, exactly.

542
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So I don't I don't know what it'll do, what what they can do to do something new.

543
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But anyway, we'll see. We'll see where this leads. Let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether it was the hits or something new.

544
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Dark Soccer, I know you pretty much already talked about the Pinball Fest, but I'm sure there were some other video games in there you played too, right? How was your gaming week?

545
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I started Terranigma.

546
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It's so slow to start. It was so slow. I got so bored, but I made it past the towers.

548
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And so I think it's going to be a lot more interesting now.

549
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Of course, I did forgo my stream last night for more Terranigma and Friday for, you know, where I was gonna play more Dead by Daylight.

550
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
There's today I did play Dead by Daylight.

551
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Make sure if you are playing the game that you log in every day to get your 66,666 blood points for the upcoming anniversary.

552
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Did you see the leaks?

553
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I did see the leaks about Locker Guy and the new survivor with none of the dredge.

554
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
None of them had good perks.

555
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Hattie.

556
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,000
But the thing about her that makes me interested is she appeared in lore for years.

557
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:56,000
She and the guy, Jordan, that you could see on the written paper, both of them were referenced in four different tomes.

558
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Going back, I think, to Tome 3.

559
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Well, and the dredge is in the doctor's stuff, right?

560
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:10,000
The dredge's backstory is that it was actually formed by the negativity from a particular village or something.

561
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
There was a personification of the negativity of the internet.

562
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Because you could make a lot of killers out of that.

563
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yikes.

564
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's basically all the salty survivors, you know, complaining about NoEd.

565
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah.

566
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Yeah, you bring NoEd.

567
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I don't know, why do you bring Dead Hard, bitch?

568
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Anyway, by the way, I don't know if anyone in the DVD fandom follows Samination, Disney's animated Dead by Daylight parodies.

569
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
The last one is on point.

570
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
On point about annoying survivors.

571
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'll leave it there.

572
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Also, they had the British lady who does the nurse and calls everyone a twat.

573
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I love her.

574
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Alright, back to my gaming week.

575
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I've done wordscapes and a shitload of pinball.

576
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And yeah, that's it.

577
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Alright, good enough.

578
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

579
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
All Minecraft again.

580
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Sorry.

581
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
No, you're just working on new videos, right?

582
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Yeah, new videos.

583
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I put out a video yesterday.

584
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yeah, so I put out a video yesterday.

585
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And then just working on more stuff for that.

586
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Probably just gonna build more farms and stuff to take a break from building buildings.

587
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But yeah, it's been going well.

588
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Alright, good.

589
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
My gaming week.

590
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I've also been playing a lot of the same stuff.

591
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I did a couple nights streaming Final Fantasy XIV on my personal stream.

592
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Shane joined me for a lot of random adventures.

593
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
He was trying to teach me some of the new raids.

594
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So we did a few of the new 8-man fights.

595
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
We were gonna finish up, but he has family in town this week.

596
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So we'll probably have to finish those other two fights later in the week or something.

597
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
We'll see.

598
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And then I've also been playing.

599
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I played Dead by Daylight.

600
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I've been on a little bit of a break.

601
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I haven't played a lot lately, so I think that was good to kind of take a little break.

602
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And I was logging in to get my 66,000 blood points.

603
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I was like, eh, I'll fire up a match or two.

604
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And I was actually having a good time.

605
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I've been playing more Killer again, which is interesting, because I was doing a lot

606
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
of Survivor for a bit.

607
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But I was like, oh, Killer's fun.

608
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I still really love to play the Onryo or the girl, Sadako from The Ring.

609
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
But I'm not, like, I can feel that I'm not as good with her as I am with, like, probably Wraith.

610
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I just think, I actually don't really care for Wraith as a Killer,

611
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:37,000
but, like, he's really, like, a good base, basic Killer, basically, you know, the cloaking mechanic.

612
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
His whole thing is turning invisible and, you know, hiding from Survivors and stuff.

613
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So I've been, yeah, I've been playing that.

614
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Ding, ding.

615
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yep.

616
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Oh, no, I always use that add-on where the ding, ding, you hear it across the whole map.

617
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Like, it doesn't matter where you are.

618
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
You hear the dings everywhere, so you never know if he's next to you or not.

619
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I was, some people actually take the thing from the Samination of their Wraith going, ding, ding, bitches.

620
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I'll have to show you that, but yeah.

621
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And then, I'm going to be honest, something I haven't played around with in a long time is emulators.

622
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm going to be just completely transparent.

623
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I fell down this rabbit hole of, I've never really explored RetroArch as an emulator before,

624
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:28,000
but I just had this bug where I was like, I want to see if I can, like, get Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix from PlayStation 1.

625
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm like, my computer ought to emulate PlayStation 1 games.

626
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Allen Computer does it.

627
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I don't know, I've never done it.

628
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm going to, so I fell down this rabbit hole of getting RetroArch installed, getting the core installed, and playing Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix.

629
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And I even got the, I even figured out how to do the disc swap to, like, second club append and all that stuff, which was fun.

630
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And yeah, just a lot of stuff that I missed.

631
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So I was playing some DDR stuff.

632
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah, DarkTitius says, I know DDR PlayStation is tough to emulate because of the timing.

633
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah, I noticed one core would get the timing way off compared to another one.

634
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So yeah, there's that.

635
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Bobby says, RetroArch is great, but the people who develop RetroArch aren't the best.

636
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Oh no, don't ruin it for me.

637
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Oh, there's drama.

638
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Well, I thought it was open source though, because I felt like there's all these cores.

639
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And I recognized the Atari 2600 one was Stella, and that emulator's been around forever.

640
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So I figured a lot of it was open source or whatever, so interesting.

641
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So that's where I started.

642
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm not saying that's the end all, be all the emulators, but I was just having a good time finding old rhythm games and playing in an emulator since, you know, I can't play them any other.

643
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I think I need to be open and talking about this as much as, you know, I don't agree with piracy and so forth.

644
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I could lend you a PlayStation.

645
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Well, how else am I supposed to play?

646
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Well, okay, so fine.

647
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I could get an old PlayStation that still works.

648
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
But the reality is like, I can't play these on my PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5.

649
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You know, I can't even get them on the cloud because of all the music licensing and stuff.

650
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So it's like, I see it as game preservation and getting to revisit a period of my life that I really enjoyed.

651
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I would be happy to buy any new DDR game that they put out on PlayStation 4 or 5.

652
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I've bought them all.

653
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So, you know, anyway.

654
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Sacred Jade said no PS2 or PS3.

655
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
No, I didn't get that far.

656
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I have a PS3.

657
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I have a Japanese PS2 I can lend you.

658
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Well, no, I actually still have a Japanese PS2.

659
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I don't know if it works or not, but my PS3 doesn't play PS2 games.

660
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I guess it would play PS1 games, though.

661
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:47,000
But anyway, I only have room to hook up so many systems on my TV and I don't know if the PS2 works anymore, to be honest.

662
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Doesn't the PS3 also adhere to the region locking?

663
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah, there's that too.

664
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So that's an issue.

665
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
When we were doing endings, for example, we were swapping out the endings to watch all the Tekken endings.

666
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And our Tekken 1 and Tekken 2 are American, but my Tekken 3 is Japanese.

667
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So, just throwing that out there.

668
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Once we switched to the Tekken 3 disc, we couldn't switch back.

669
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Once I had the emulator up and running, then I was like, oh, I want to play some old Atari 2600 stuff.

670
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Because I have a bunch of, you know, dumb 2600 games.

671
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I think we all do. They're so small.

672
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Like, you know, it's so easy to go back and visit them.

673
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
There was a story going around.

674
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I don't think it's in tonight's show, so I'll just bring it up.

675
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Because Bobby had retweeted it and it caught my eye.

676
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And it was that they tracked down the programmer who made the first Atari 2600 game and first video game that had a woman as the lead character that you could play as.

677
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It was a game called Wabbit.

678
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
W-A-B-B-I-T.

679
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And it was a woman who made it.

680
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And because of a misspelling, they lost track of her for years and years.

681
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
But this website found her and did a whole little article on it and on that game called Wabbit.

682
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So I kind of had, you know, a bug to go play Wabbit.

683
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Because I thought the article was very well done.

684
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I thought she was a part of history, gaming history, really, that hasn't been talked about a lot.

685
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Like, you know, we talk about, you know, Roberta Williams, you know, River Raid was made by what we – this was one I honestly didn't know about.

686
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So it's kind of like, oh, I want to go play this Wabbit game.

687
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So I played a little bit of that.

688
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And then, of course, I fell down the Atari 2600 rabbit hole.

689
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Thank you.

690
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Tigercloth found the article.

691
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Van Tran was the name of the – but they had misspelled it like – they misspelled her first name, I think, or something.

692
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
But anyway, very cool story that was going around.

693
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
But then I fell down a rabbit hole.

694
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I played one of my favorites.

695
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
H-E-R-O is one of my favorite 2600 games.

696
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I was playing pitfalls.

697
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I was playing a bunch of random stuff.

698
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And then on NES, this is what I want to get to.

699
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I played a Zelda randomizer because that's another thing I've been wanting to get into is I think the randomizers are fun.

700
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
But then I realized I'm really disgustingly out of practice on Zelda.

701
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And so I need to just play Zelda 1, like, start to finish again before I think about doing a stupid randomizer because it's hard if you're getting killed the basic stuff.

702
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So that's – I'm very out of practice.

703
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
But I think the randomizer stuff is something I really want to get into because I think it's really fascinating.

704
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And I really love the randomizer that Zelda and Metroid mix together.

705
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I think that's cool.

706
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Oh, yeah, those are fun.

707
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Yeah, the Z1M1 or whatever it's called.

708
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I thought that was really cool.

709
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So I want to get into that.

710
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
So thank you, emulators, for making that stuff possible because, I mean, Nintendo could do this themselves.

711
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
But I'm sure, you know, based on all these interviews Reggie's been doing about his book, I'm sure the line would be,

712
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Nintendo doesn't see the value in doing – Nintendo doesn't see the value in randomizers.

713
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Nintendo doesn't see the value in these classic IP.

714
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Okay, then fine.

715
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
If you won't do it, then we will.

716
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
All right, let's move on.

717
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
We're going to get into some news and talk about other stuff that's been going on.

718
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
By the way, I should bring this up.

719
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Usually we do a little bit of housekeeping after our gaming week and get into like what's in the news.

720
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I should bring this up at some point.

721
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
We haven't done a lot of planning, but there's kind of a big show coming up for OLR, if you are not aware.

722
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,000
June 26th, 2022, which happens to be my birthday.

723
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That's not the reason this is a big day, but it's a funny coincidence.

724
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It is the closest show to June 23rd, which is the actual 20th birthday of Orange Lounge Radio.

725
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
So our 20th anniversary show will be June 26th, 2022.

726
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I have no idea what we're going to do to make it special.

727
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But that's it. I'm just putting it out there.

728
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
We will be doing our 20th anniversary show on June the 26th.

729
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So we'll see.

730
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Bobby says he will miss it.

731
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
You know what I kind of want to do?

732
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I haven't talked to my co-host about this. I don't know.

733
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But if Bobby's not here that night, that means we can do as long of a show as we want.

734
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So if we want to do an all-day show, we can.

735
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I kind of want to.

736
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
But I don't know. Then again, I also...

737
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Be me screaming while I play Dead by Daylight in the background.

738
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I'm also in my 40s and I'm like, I don't know if I could go out there anymore.

739
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Rob, I've done 13 hours.

740
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
See, I don't know if I could. I don't know.

741
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
With the three of us, we could do a marathon. That would be easy.

742
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yeah, we probably could. It would be easy. We'll see.

743
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So more planning to come. We've got six weeks to figure it out.

744
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So in good OLR fashion, we'll figure it out in five weeks, the week before.

745
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Alright, but I just wanted you to note, I wanted you to circle that on your calendar.

746
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Just like Bobby Blackwolf neglected to do when he was like,

747
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Oh, I'm going to go to Minneapolis instead.

748
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
But since it's for a charity event that's actually kind of awesome,

749
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I guess I won't give him a lot of shit.

750
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But it does mean that since Bobby won't be here, technically we could take over the stream for the entire day.

751
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So there is a silver lining to this.

752
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And I'm willing to work on the silver lining.

753
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Other question here before we get into other news.

754
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Tigerclaw says you played the new Evil Dead game.

755
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I haven't. I watched some streams of it because a lot of the Dead by Daylight streamers are pivoting

756
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
because, you know, Evil Dead is another four versus one game.

757
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But it looks very different. It doesn't really look...

758
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And VHS is still down.

759
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah, VHS is still down.

760
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
The killer isn't like killers in Dead by Daylight.

761
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And the whole crux of the game is different. And that's fine.

762
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Not everything should be compared to Dead by Daylight just because it's four versus one.

763
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Or evolve, if you will, just because it's four versus one.

764
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It did look interesting. It looked like some of those enemies in it are mean.

765
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Really, they rush at you and say, it looks kind of scary.

766
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I don't know. It might be a bit too intense for me.

767
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But I enjoyed watching the streams.

768
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So, we'll see.

769
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
All right, let's get into gaming news.

770
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
We'll start off with this story from Loki.

771
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Loki, please start us off.

772
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yes. So, there is a lawsuit against Valve saying that Steam is giving Valve too much power.

773
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Apparently, it is moving forward in the US District Court.

774
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And this is regarding, I guess, Wolfire Games.

775
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:43,000
They had alleged that Valve is using its, I guess, dominance of the market to enforce control over developers

776
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,000
and influencing how games, even non-Steam games, are sold and priced.

777
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I think one of their arguments is there is a rule that you cannot price your game lower,

778
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
like on another marketplace permanently, than you can on Steam.

779
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Because if you think about it, like if I put my game up on Steam,

780
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
but then I make it available on my site and selling it like, you know, much cheaper than it is on Steam,

781
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I'm kind of using Steam as like, you know, trying to get exposure through Steam,

782
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
but then I'm selling it directly on my site.

783
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Well, people would manipulate Steam's cut that way.

784
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:30,000
They would be, it's the whole Fortnite thing, which is a whole other Oprah I'm not going to get into,

785
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
but it's kind of that. But anyway, I digress.

786
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Yeah. Also, any complaints about the percentage that they're taking that's, you know, 30% is too much,

787
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
even though I think a lot of the platforms out there right now take 30% as well.

788
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Kind of standard, yeah.

789
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
It is kind of standard.

790
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
You know, according to Rosin, he said that,

791
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I believe that this makes developers afraid that if they don't sell on Steam, they will lose the majority of their revenue.

792
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:06,000
To those developers, avoiding Steam would add unacceptable risk to the already high risk of game development in general.

793
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I believe that most developers have little or no choice to sell on Steam and do as they're told by Valve.

794
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Well, it's because they're the leading marketplace.

795
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And if you want your game, you know, a lot of people use that marketplace.

796
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:26,000
It's just, I would be willing to bet Epic has probably similar rules when it comes to pricing your game.

797
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And you're not limited to just sell on Steam. You can sell in other places.

798
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Amazon has that same pricing rule, by the way.

799
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Yeah. They're just saying that, like, you have to price your games the same. I don't know.

800
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It's very similar. This is a throwback, but it's very similar to Walmart and audio CD censorship.

801
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And how artists would get pissed off when their audio CDs would get censored,

802
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
like a sticker would go over something on the cover or there would be the clean lyrics version of the album,

803
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
because otherwise Walmart wouldn't sell it.

804
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And to not be in Walmart would be to not have your CD sold in many parts of the country.

805
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Obviously, the internet has fixed all of this, because now you can download anywhere.

806
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
But it reminds me of that, how things would be, literally art would be changed,

807
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
so it could be sold in a certain marketplace. And at least Steam isn't changing anything.

808
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Loki, can I ask this question? You're a game maker. You're a game developer.

809
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
You're a published game developer.

810
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Okay. Yeah.

811
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Did you sell more of your game on itch.io or Steam?

812
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I think it's about the same.

813
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Okay.

814
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Honestly, like, and itch still takes a cut too. I don't remember what their cut is, but I think it's similar.

815
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I don't know, honestly, the numbers are so small, I can't tell you where more of them came from.

816
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I think probably itch, but it's almost even, if anything.

817
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Because I think you were telling people to get it on itch because you get a better cut.

818
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
No, I wasn't saying to do it that way necessarily.

819
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It's basically the same either way. You get it.

820
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah, it's just easier than saying download this game, then download the DLC for this game as well.

821
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I think that confused people a little bit, so I was just saying go through it because it's easier.

822
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Or you can get it whatever platform you want, honestly.

823
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Yeah.

824
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
But yeah, I don't know necessarily that.

825
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:38,000
The only pressure I think that I would feel if I was publishing a game, let's say it wasn't a Nintendo game,

826
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,000
the only pressure I'd feel of wanting to get my game on Steam is because that's where most of the eyeballs are.

827
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And Steam is a huge marketplace where you could sell games and people just buy games off there like they're collecting stuff.

828
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
A lot of stuff you don't even play.

829
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
But you can probably make a lot of sales and they're doing that with bundles and stuff like that.

830
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
But it is a huge marketplace.

831
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
You could put your game on the Epic Game Store or something like that, but that's not as big of a marketplace.

832
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Or good old games is another option as well.

833
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
But once again, those marketplaces aren't as large as Steam.

834
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Steam is just massive.

835
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
There's lots of other storefronts.

836
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And with being PC, it's super easy to just offer your game up through different storefronts.

837
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I don't know, but we'll see.

838
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Right now, the reason why, the lawsuit's moving forward because the judge agrees that there is sufficient to plausible alleged unlawful conduct, I guess.

839
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:52,000
So it's plausible that maybe they're doing something, but it's going to be a hard case to make, I think.

840
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I think so, too.

841
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I think because games can be sold in many other different marketplaces,

842
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I think it's going to be a tough case to prove.

843
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:11,000
But we'll see because the justice branch of our government does all sorts of dumb things right now.

844
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So who knows what's going to happen.

845
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
All right, moving on.

846
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Let's talk about the Nintendo Indie World Showcase that happened this week.

847
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Yay!

848
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Indie World.

849
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
So it's a bunch of announcements, of course, about the more indie games that are available on Nintendo Switch.

850
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
They showed off 20 games.

851
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Four games were available today.

852
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Some of the games that they showed off at the Indie World included Ooblets,

853
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Batora, Lost Haven, which is an actiony RPG type of game that's a little bit Diablo,

854
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Elekhead, kind of a puzzle game.

855
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah, I saw that one.

856
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah.

857
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Soundfall, which just came out.

858
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And that game looked really cool because that was a music game dungeon crawler.

859
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Talk about a game that's up my alley and it has over 140 songs in it.

860
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I believe there is a Steam version of this, ironically enough, that I think you can import your own music, too,

861
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
which obviously you wouldn't be able to do on Nintendo Switch, but it does have 140 songs in it.

862
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And that was really cool.

863
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I want to check that game out.

864
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So Soundfall was probably the one that got the most attention from me.

865
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Wildfrost, a roguelike deck builder.

866
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
It's pretty cool with Norse mythology in it.

867
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Totally accurate battle simulator.

868
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Gunbrella, which is a new game from Gato Roboto developers, Doinksoft.

869
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It's a noir punk Metroid kind of game.

870
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:45,000
We Are OFK, which is a kind of like making the band kind of narrative adventure.

871
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
And that has also just came out this week with the indie world.

872
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Silt came out as well.

873
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Looks like kind of a scary game with fish, scary fish.

874
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Mini Motorways, Wayward Strand, Cult of the Lamb, which was a game that had been shown at PAX East.

875
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So a lot of folks had their hand on it anyway.

876
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Another Crab's Treasure, one-shot World Machine Edition, Gibbon Beyond the Trees.

877
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Sorry, I'm running through this, but there's a lot of games.

878
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Idol Manager, Card Shark, which is an interesting kind of looking card game where you actually are cheating at cards.

879
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
It's kind of cool.

880
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Cursed to Golf.

881
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
That title alone is great.

882
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It's a golf roguelike game that was also at PAX East, so some people saw that already.

883
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:43,000
A guidebook of Babel and Opus Echo of Starsong, the full bloom edition.

884
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So I don't think there were any games in there that people, like huge indie games, but there was some PAX stuff and some things that were ports of PC things that people were excited to see about.

885
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:07,000
But this is definitely the calm before, I would assume, the big June Nintendo Direct that will have what we can expect for the rest of the year.

886
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
So that would be pretty cool.

887
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So that was Indie World.

888
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Let's move on, Dark Sakura.

889
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Finding my unmute button would be nice. Hello.

890
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Hi.

891
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,000
So Twitter is doing video games, kind of, sort of.

892
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Basically, there is a little game that they put out called Twitter Data Dash.

893
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And it's a little side-scrolling platformer that basically tries to prepare one for how to combat disinformation on the internet.

894
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
You play a little cute puppy. He's blue. His name is Data.

895
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And you have to find these bones that are hidden in this environment.

896
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Basically, after you complete the objective, the level ends and then Twitter gives you information, like a PSA announcement before you can go on.

897
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:33,000
The author here says that they gave instructions on how to filter DMs or how to turn off targeted ads, stuff like that.

898
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:41,000
But then, as you go through the game, though, you do have some sort of enemy.

899
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So, like, when you start the game, it gives you a warning of avoiding cat ads that are in the way.

900
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
And you run into some cats who have their own little propaganda.

901
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And you have to dodge them to not take damage.

902
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But I want to hug the cats.

903
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Me too. I want to hug every cat.

904
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:14,000
The thing is that it's been stated by other people that if Twitter wanted it to be accurate, you wouldn't be just running around freely.

905
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
You wouldn't just be dodging bad guys and getting bones or whatever.

906
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
The bad guys would be unavoidable.

907
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
They would crush you. They would surround you.

908
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And they would even do it when you're not playing.

909
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Because that's how the internet works.

910
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,000
If we were going to have a more accurate representation, we'd be playing fucking Twitter meets Elden Ring.

911
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:53,000
But I can see what is behind it.

912
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I can see it being a conversation starter.

913
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Something to get people thinking about it.

914
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And also, how can Musk not realize that there are fucking fake accounts on Twitter?

915
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I mean, seriously?

916
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,000
He's doing his research. He's checking 100 random accounts to make sure they're not bots.

917
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
He's going to find some roleplay accounts and be like, the fuck is this shit?

918
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I hope he comes across everybody's alts.

919
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I hope he finds one of my roleplay accounts that I don't touch anymore.

920
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
That sample size, 100 out of 3.5 million or something like that?

921
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
That's not even scratching the surface.

922
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Apparently he claims that's what Twitter does internally.

923
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
But you know what? This story has nothing to do with him.

924
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And as far as I'm concerned, I would like Twitter to have nothing to do with him.

925
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And I'm hoping to hell that deal falls apart.

926
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Because I've said this very openly on my Twitter.

927
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
If he reverses that ban on the insurrectionist, I'm out.

928
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I'm out. I'm not using Twitter anymore. Period.

929
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And people are quick to say, oh, you're just being dramatic.

930
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
You don't mean it. No, I fucking mean it.

931
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Spite is incredibly motivating.

932
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
There is nothing forcing me to use Twitter.

933
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I like Twitter. I've met a lot of awesome people on Twitter.

934
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But I'm not going to use it if he's back on it. Bye.

935
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I still would rather Twitter than Facebook.

936
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Even with.

937
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Facebook is even more harmful.

938
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I don't know where I go.

939
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And I'm not just going to say, oh, I'm going to do Instagram.

940
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Going back to LiveJournal, baby.

941
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I've been tempted, actually.

942
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Actually, you know what I will say I like?

943
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Is Pillowfort.

944
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Because it's very similar to LiveJournal.

945
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Without basically being a Russian company at this point.

946
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I still have my lifetime account.

947
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Yeah, I know. Yeah, that's true. I have mine too.

948
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
But Pillowfort's nice.

949
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:57,000
But I think if Twitter does unban You-Know-Who,

950
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I think there's going to be.

951
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And I know people are quick to point out he has said he's not coming back to Twitter.

952
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Number one, I don't trust a word out of that motherfucker's mouth.

953
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And I call him the same thing that Patti LuPone calls a motherfucker.

954
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And number two.

955
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Except I don't think his mom would do it.

956
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Number two.

957
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Sometimes it's about the principal.

958
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Rolling out the red carpet and inviting the person back is bad enough for me that I'm willing to leave.

959
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
So, anyway.

960
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Just pulling that out there.

961
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
That still, though, doesn't really have.

962
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Oh, yeah, it has nothing to do with the game.

963
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Yeah, sorry.

964
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So, the game, obviously, this was something that was being worked on before any of that.

965
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Go ahead.

966
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I had a little bit more about it.

967
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Yeah, go for it.

968
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
The thing is that I think that the game itself, like I was saying, is a great idea.

969
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:00,000
It's good to get it into the thoughts of people who would not normally think about this kind of thing.

970
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Actually, probably even good for kids new to social media.

971
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
You know, get them starting to be on the road to good habits.

972
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:15,000
But as many have pointed out, it's not going to do enough.

973
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
But if it can get the conversation started and get people thinking about what they read,

974
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:33,000
then even if that thing returns, if it can at least get people starting to think objectively about anything anyone says on the internet,

975
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
then I'm for it.

976
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
It's a little gesture.

977
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
We know it's not the whole story.

978
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Who fucking cares?

979
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
It's getting the conversation started.

980
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I applaud the attempt to educate, and I think games go a long way in educating,

981
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and we don't often talk about that topic on this show, although we all reminisce about the Oregon Trail,

982
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Carmen Sandiego, Number Munchers, and all those edutainment games,

983
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Reader Rabbit, whatever.

984
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
We all reminisce about the edutainment games of the past.

985
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
But games are a very effective tool in being able to teach.

986
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I think as far as this one goes, the only kind of weird thing about it for me,

987
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I only heard about it through video game blogs and the types of sites.

988
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I didn't see anything about it on Twitter.

989
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And Twitter knows that I play video games because I get the recommended topics and all that.

990
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So Twitter knows I'm like a gamer.

991
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
So it's weird to me that Twitter themselves hasn't tried to put this game in front of me.

992
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And I don't know if maybe it's just a slow burn.

993
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
They're not ready to do that yet.

994
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
They want to test it a little more and that sort of thing.

995
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
But it's a little weird that I only found out about it because I follow gaming things.

996
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Or maybe that was the intent. I don't know.

997
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
But I feel like this needs to get out in front of a lot of people, not just...

998
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I like the art style, though.

999
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Yeah. There's a lot of good things about it.

1000
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And I applaud the fact that they're trying,

1001
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
despite the fact that we might be pointing out ways it could be better.

1002
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But how dare they demonize cats like that? I'm serious.

1003
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
That's the number one complaint I have, that's for sure.

1004
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
All right. Well, let's talk about something that a lot of people are bitching about.

1005
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Not people I follow, but I'm seeing a lot of bitching elsewhere on Twitter about this one.

1006
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Loki, please.

1007
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:27,000
What? We talked about last week how Square Enix made the brilliant decision to sell off their assets

1008
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
because they're jumping headfirst into the NFT market.

1009
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
And just like, you know, the south part, I mean, and it's gone.

1010
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So the end of team market is basically down 92% from last September.

1011
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So it's crashing hard. There's been the hashtag crypto crash going around.

1012
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
They said $200 billion has been recently wiped out of it.

1013
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And even on top of that, you know, cryptocurrency is also down as a whole right now and by a lot, I think.

1014
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:09,000
So it's, you know, not a probably a good time to jump in the NFTs.

1015
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Or maybe this is the dip that we all have to buy.

1016
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
That's probably what they're trying to convince us.

1017
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
That's what those Twitter accounts will be convincing you of right now, attempting to convince you of.

1018
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So there was another game company that had put out was Axie Infinity, which was a kind of a Pokemon type game,

1019
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I guess that you would breed monsters with potions and you would use your cryptocurrency, your earned cryptocurrency through that.

1020
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:49,000
But apparently, though, the Axie Infinity's SLP or their Smooth Love Potions, which is, I guess, the currency that they had.

1021
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Went down to zero from I'm not sure where I was originally at here.

1022
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Let's see. A lot more than zero, I believe.

1023
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
But yeah, it's pretty much worthless now.

1024
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,000
So it's one of those play the earned game so you can earn a bunch of worthless stuff like any other game.

1025
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,000
There's a lot of video games that you earn worthless stuff, but, you know, basically people lied to thinking it would.

1026
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Yeah, it wasn't worth a ton. I mean, this is kind of like Dogecoin a little bit where like SLP was basically at thirty five cents each.

1027
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
But now it's, you know, a lot less than that.

1028
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,000
So that's quite a drop. But. You know. Not great.

1029
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I already ranted about this plenty last week, so I'm not going to repeat myself, but I'm just going to stress, you know, again.

1030
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And I think, you know, if you listen carefully to what the three of us were talking about last week in that discussion on NFT, we said in there there is potential.

1031
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
There is potential with this, with the right implementation of it.

1032
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
The problem is the face of NFT right now is crime.

1033
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Get rich quick schemes, hacks, Twitter, MLMs, basically Reddit posts like the face and those hideous fucking monkeys.

1034
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,000
The face of NFT right now is so broken, like no fucking shit. It crashed.

1035
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And if this technology is ever to be rescued and implemented for something good, it needs a better face.

1036
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,000
It needs something better behind it. It doesn't need a Pokemon knockoff. It needs Pokemon.

1037
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
It doesn't need a knockoff of a good racing game.

1038
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:51,000
It needs a good racing game with a good reason and something that doesn't fucking read as transparent because the gaming community will be up your ass if you implement something that's half assed.

1039
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Again, I'm going to point to the Diablo three real money auction house, which as far as I'm concerned was this many years ago and has already failed.

1040
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So if this is ever to be successful, and again, I'm not going to repeat myself a lot from last week, but it just needs to have a better mascot than what it has right now.

1041
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:16,000
It needs to stop feeling like a giant fucking pyramid scheme because that's what it feels like. And I'm sure there's lots of crypto bros that want to take issue with what I said. Tough shit.

1042
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I'm just saying what everyone is thinking. I just told you what the problem is. Maybe you should instead of trying to bully people into your opinion and how we're all wrong about NFTs.

1043
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Maybe you should work on fixing the actual problem. Done.

1044
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Would anyone else like to add anything?

1045
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
All right. No, I think that pretty much sums it up. I think I try my best. All right, then let's- Well done.

1046
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Yes, DarkSagra? I said well done, Rob. Well done. Oh, okay. I thought you said hold on. And I was like, Oh, yes, please. No. All right.

1047
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:56,000
All right. Let's move on and talk about Final Fantasy 14. This controversy seems so like light hearted compared to the last one.

1048
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:04,000
But anyway, Final Fantasy 14 is having some issues with mods because mods really aren't allowed for Final Fantasy 14.

1049
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:16,000
You are not supposed to be using third party modifications that will change your HUD so that you can do things that aren't normally in the game. Very controversial with things like DPS meters.

1050
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Also, like these add ons and HUD upgrades, they're all over WoW, World of Warcraft, and have generally been accepted as a part of WoW for a long time.

1051
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:34,000
They're not in Final Fantasy or they're not really endorsed by Final Fantasy 14. And in fact, they're actually against the terms of service.

1052
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It's interesting, though, because there was one point when Final Fantasy 14 was supposed to be embracing these. They said they were going to kind of support mods and allow it.

1053
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:56,000
But then I think they had a change of heart when they saw how people tend to treat DPS meters, and that people would just be shits to people over their DPS if they weren't, you know, the best of the best.

1054
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And some of the toxic stuff you see in WoW, which is interesting that WoW is now implementing a social contract, but I digress a little bit.

1055
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Anyway, what's going on? And why is this issue coming up now? Because there's a world first race going on right now. And there's a new raid that was in the game, Dragon Songs reprise. It is very hard. It is considered an ultimate raid.

1056
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Final Fantasy 14 does not do test servers. People were not able to explore this fight before the fact, like happens a lot in WoW. When this went live, this was people's first time kind of getting to see all this.

1057
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:44,000
So this is the first time that this was out. And there's a big world first race amongst all these different, you know, raiding groups that try to put this together.

1058
01:15:44,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And there was a stream of the game, a Final Fantasy 14 player, Hiroro, was playing the game, and he had mods visible on his stream as was racing for world first. He got automatically teleported to the Mordian Jail.

1059
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:13,000
It is a room. And by the way, if you listen to other podcasts, call this Gaol. It's just jail. It's an old English way of saying jail. And they use this a lot in Final Fantasy 14.

1060
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:34,000
So the player went to the Mordian Jail, and that was all happening live on stream. And the GM basically said, you have to change it or you're going to get a suspension. The footage has since been erased from Twitch, but you know how it goes.

1061
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:48,000
There are screenshots of the stream. There's something on YouTube going on. Oh yeah, Bagel Goose happened to them too. They also got transported to the jail, and that is all on YouTube to see.

1062
01:16:48,000 --> 01:17:06,000
So yeah, it actually cultivated with Yoshi P writing a whole letter basically saying, stop using these add ons. You're not supposed to be using them. But maybe it's sort of like a peace offering or something like that.

1063
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:15,000
They're looking at possibly upping the HUD elements that are in the game right now. In the statement, Yoshida said,

1064
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Meaning they've beaten it in house.

1065
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Square Enix may stop congratulating race winning teams if this public recognition encourages excessive competition and controversy so that third party tools are used. That's very interesting, I think.

1066
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:10,000
But, you know, it's interesting because, you know, they kind of go on to say, maybe they need to make some improvements to the HUD and work on that. So the team is kind of looking at this going, all right, what can we do to make this better, rather than just, you know, yell at everybody for breaking the rule.

1067
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
So I think that's kind of interesting.

1068
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:51,000
So by default, everybody's pretty much playing on PC, but Final Fantasy 14, I think really embraces its nature of being playable both on PC and PlayStation. So, yeah.

1069
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:01,000
All right. Anyhow, we're going to move on to our next story. So Dark Sakura, why don't you take up our next story?

1070
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:16,000
All right. So when we had the Black Lives Matter protests, the video game companies were pretty loud and vocal in support of it, remember?

1071
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Yes, all the white text on black backgrounds. Yes, I do remember that.

1072
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Yep. For the record, this is important. At any rate, when there was that leaked draft of that disgusting opinion by Justice Alito, our video game companies have actually been pretty silent about it.

1073
01:19:44,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I mean, then again, how many of them are mostly white dudes, cis dudes who wouldn't know anything about a woman's body except insert tab A into slot B, repeat as necessary.

1074
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:16,000
But anyway, we did get some support. And actually, don't just get me started on that one because that man has zero concept of who he's referencing in history.

1075
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:29,000
The people that he's referencing are back from the 1800s, the 1700s, and back in those days, guys had no involvement other than getting their wives pregnant and they were slave owners.

1076
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:41,000
All right, I'm going to take a step back because I could go off on this as someone who knows history. That man needs to get his Catholic ass back in school with a real history teacher.

1077
01:20:42,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Anyway, so after the draft was leaked on May 2nd, Bungie published a statement in regards to reproductive rights saying that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, it is, quote, a blow to freedom in America and a direct attack on human rights.

1078
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:21,000
And had asked fans to donate to reproductive rights organizations. A few other indie developers like Double Fine, ArenaNet that does Guild Wars, did their own statements.

1079
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And then there's some workers who said that they would participate in the week long Mother's Day strike by stopping work for their companies for that week. But the biggest names haven't said anything.

1080
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:59,000
I mean, we had almost universal support for Black Lives Matter. But I mean, and actually, and also for the anti Asian hate crimes that were happening right after COVID-19 was, you know, a new pandemic.

1081
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:10,000
But, and I'm going to go ahead and say what my sources on this Washington Post, and they reached out to 20 different video game companies, and only Microsoft and Activision replied.

1082
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Microsoft said, Microsoft will continue to do everything we can under the law to protect our employees rights and support employees and their enrolled dependents and accessing critical health care, which already includes services like abortion and gender affirming care regardless of where they live across the US.

1083
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:42,000
The support is being extended to include travel expense assistance for these and other medical services where access to care is limited and availability in the employees home geographic region.

1084
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Amazon, Tesla, Lyft, Uber promised monetary aid and legal protection to their employees in states that have bans.

1085
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:09,000
But the thing is, there's all these other states that are already have legislation in the wings or have passed legislation that is now on a stay.

1086
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:27,000
That all of that is threatened to be overturned and I think in Missouri, they said that if you leave this state to seek health care of that nature, and it is health care, it is health care that they will prosecute.

1087
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:46,000
And now, the studio Certain Affinity, which worked on Halo Infinite based in Texas, their CEO was saying that it took them by surprise and he's quoted saying that we will absolutely take a strong stance on this.

1088
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:58,000
We will consider how to best support our staff who may be effective, but we haven't had a chance to get out in front of messaging or strategy yet. It caught us a bit off guard. We're still an independent company with limited resources.

1089
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:12,000
The thing is, is that this is absolutely an attack on women and uterus possessing people. It is an attack.

1090
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Alito's document stated that by his weird convoluted logic, that this is not a gender issue, that it is not discriminatory against women or those possessing a uterus. It absolutely is, because the only people that it affects are people who can be pregnant.

1091
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:55,000
And the theory is that with reversing this, that they're going to start pushing for more and more like reversing access to contraception, to start reversing things like marriage equality,

1092
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:06,000
supporting our transgender people, the protections that they have. It's a major step in reverse.

1093
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Didn't Disney just get shat upon for not saying enough where they were? Everything is going to be a damned if you do, damned if you don't take your fucking stance and own it and defend it.

1094
01:25:42,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Because you know what talks, at least in the US? Money. And you know what one of the biggest industries in this country is right now? Gaming. Technology. You don't have support from those industries. You're going to get fucked.

1095
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And on top of that, especially, I'm actually surprised that Activision Blizzard would make a comment against the overturning given their history. But it's a wise move, even if it is purely for the optics.

1096
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Did you see the thing, though, and I don't mean to digress too much, but it's not on our show tonight. And I have to ask, did you see the thing, though, that they published trying to get some weird internet points or something about the diversity math is what it basically boils down to.

1097
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I didn't see that. Oh, look up the tweets. Oh, wait, I have a statement here, though. It says we are committed to an inclusive environment that is supportive of all of our employees. This comes from Rich George, who's their spokesperson.

1098
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:03,000
As a company, providing fair and equitable health care is a top priority, and we will closely monitor developments in the coming weeks and months. And then Mikey Barra.

1099
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:17,000
He said, I realize that we are late, and I am sorry it has been incredibly stressful for Blizzard and me personally as we read the news. I realize this isn't very helpful, but I'm being honest where we are and what we are discussing across the company.

1100
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And then they go into some of that about employees being distracted, scared for the future, about Kotick's commitment to improving the working conditions.

1101
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:41,000
And then I love this part of it. In fact, I'm actually going to read this verbatim. Mr. Kotick made a commitment to improve the working conditions of the many lives that work under him and make Activision the best company it can be.

1102
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And I can say without hesitation that as of right now, he's failing all of us. Thank you.

1103
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:59,000
No, I didn't read that. Usually anytime I see something from Activision, it makes me want to vomit. So I'll go look for it.

1104
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It's pretty cringe. It's just one of those things where it's like, what did you hope you were going to get from talking about this? I don't know. It is weird. It's very weird.

1105
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Well, one last-

1106
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, go ahead.

1107
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:25,000
One last quote on this one comes from Robert Anderberg, who's the CEO of Control Z. It says, our position on abortion rights in the U.S. is that we support a woman's right to choose to have an abortion for any reason.

1108
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:34,000
It says the company operates in five countries, including the U.S. However, of these countries, the U.S. is the only one where abortion is restricted and about to become more so.

1109
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:48,000
We are socially behind. We are way socially behind. And that's what you fucking get when you form a country based on religious escapism. Because I'm sorry.

1110
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Even though we're supposed to have separation of church and state in this country, but that's the amendment everyone's-

1111
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:04,000
But the country, the first people fucking over here, apart from the people who were after money, were basically religious extremists. That's just how it goes.

1112
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:27,000
At any rate, the Mother's Day strike, actually, it ends today being Sunday. But I still ask everybody out there that if you are a woman, if you know a woman or a uterus-possessing individual who is capable of giving birth,

1113
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:53,000
think about how you are hurting them if you support the overturning. Think about the mental health of these people and ask yourself if especially- because I can tell you this way, the rich people of the world are always going to have access to contraception and abortive care.

1114
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:09,000
They're always going to have access. This affects the poor, the disenfranchised, many minorities in the country. And it's another way that they're trying to contain power amongst the wealthy.

1115
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:32,000
And instead, ask yourself this. If you support- if you want to ban abortion everywhere, then are you willing to convert our government to a socialist model that will then pay for all of these births that you're sponsoring, basically, with your words?

1116
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Are you ready for us to be a socialist country? Because that's the only way that we're going to take care of all of these people, or else you're going to end up with a lot of dead children on your hands. And it's all your fault.

1117
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Secondly, the heartbeat bill? There's no fucking science that there's a heartbeat that early. It's electric synapses. The heart has not fucking formed. Science, people. Read a fucking science book. Okay, I'm done.

1118
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
No, you're fine. You're fine. I'm not going to talk over you when you're talking on this segment.

1119
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Part of that, and I'm going to be perfectly upfront with everybody, I had my tubes removed. And one person tried to talk me out of it. A medical professional and women and uterus-possessing people younger than me who have gone in for sterilization have been rejected.

1120
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And I will tell all of you this right now. If you are going to the doctor to be sterilized, no matter your age, if you are of an age of consent, if they do not do it, you ask them, I want it in writing that you are refusing to treat me.

1121
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Okay.

1122
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:56,000
No, you're fine. Let me get to some chat. You're getting a lot of snaps. Go exactly. Preach it. You get a lot of that from chat. But I do want to read some of these other comments. Questbuster says, Bungie's Twitter also clapped back at responses telling them that they should only be a game company and keep politics out of it.

1123
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Yeah, honestly, I thought that was pretty great too. I have a little bit of sympathy. I understand the companies that are like, we were caught off guard with this and we don't have a statement yet. We were all caught off guard by this, but this should be a huge fucking wake up call.

1124
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And I think it is for a lot of people like a lot of people didn't want to admit Oh, when they stole those Supreme Court seats, and they stole those Supreme Court seats again, I'm I know this isn't a political podcast, and you all probably don't want to hear it. But

1125
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:39,000
like this politics do exactly look at the impact it's having on games reality check. Look at the impact it's having on the game developers reality check. It's it's it is games, whether you want it to be or not.

1126
01:32:39,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And those and those Supreme Court seats were stolen. Let's let's be completely honest, they were stolen. For this purpose, I have to take another semi sidestep and address something that pod culture said about Christina, having to fight to get her hysterectomy for endo endometriosis is actually under diagnosed in in uterus possessing people.

1127
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:15,000
But they want to women are often don't get and I'm using women now in the I'm possessing a uterus thing even though I know it's not entirely accurate. It's just easy to say.

1128
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Endometriosis is debilitating illness, it causes pain, it can lead to infertility, and it goes so under diagnosed that by the time it can take anywhere between five to 10 years for a person to get a diagnosis of this.

1129
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:45,000
And people will go in like around 1516 with debilitating pain, not get any diagnosis until they're in their late 20s. And by then, it's too late.

1130
01:33:47,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Women, people with coronary issues are often under diagnosed, because it doesn't present itself the same way it does in in male bodies.

1131
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Overall, there is such a poor understanding of the way that a feminine body works.

1132
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Because all of the medical research has been done mostly on male bodies. Because, especially in Western culture, the female population has been seen with disdain, especially in the US.

1133
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:39,000
That's just always been how it is when the, you know, Alito keeps going back to the Constitution. But the thing is that the Constitution was written by by rich white men, slave owners.

1134
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Women were not considered at all in the drafting of the Constitution. People of color were not appreciated at all in the drafting of the Constitution. It took amendments to have that consideration.

1135
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:09,000
So if you apply all of this historical context to what we are dealing with right now, it makes perfect sense. And it also makes sense that everything that they're trying to do is going to rewind us back as a society.

1136
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:22,000
This isn't just political. This has to do with physical health, mental health, quality of life. And it's absolutely disgusting.

1137
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:50,000
And the moment that you take a step back, and you look at a uterus possessing person as a fully realized human being who should have the same rights and control of their body as any penis possessing person, and I said penis on the show and I feel glad about it.

1138
01:35:52,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I had to lighten things up a little bit. I want to say it too. But okay, penis, fine. But anyway, Loki, you want to join in? Vagina, how about that? Okay.

1139
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:29,000
But the penile possessing are given more rights, especially if you are white and cisgender, and have money and are Christian. If you hit all those little tick marks, you're at the top of the food chain. You get. You have all the rights. No one can fuck with you, basically.

1140
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:56,000
But if you were anything less than that, you are other. If you were anything that is not, you know, business suited, you know, fine dining white people, you are still considered even I can tell you this right now, if you hit all of those tick marks, but you're black, you're already other.

1141
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:23,000
If you hit all of those tick marks, but you're a woman, you're already other. It's this disgusting double standard that's in this country and then we have people who are really at the bottom of the food chain who just think automatically because they are white that they are exempt from all of this that they don't care because it's not happening to them. Well, guess fucking what? It does happen to you.

1142
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:46,000
You are in that lower percentile and you are other to them. They don't give a shit. And if you want them to give a shit, you need to start thinking objectively. You need to start using logic. You need to take your emotions out of the picture and lay down the fact, study your history, look at the world around you, look at other fucking countries.

1143
01:37:46,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Our internet searches here are so America based once they check your IP that it's hard to find actual news that is happening outside of this country. Like I have to use a VPN if I actually want to go to the real BBC website, for example. And we need to stop looking at our little narrow box. We need to stop looking at the thing that's right in front of us and look at the big picture. It is not just you in this country. It is not just me in this country.

1144
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:38,000
And it's not just this country. We're a fucking world. What we do here affects so many other people on top of it. People look to America. I hate to say it because what the fuck are we doing right now? But people look to us. And the moment that we keep othering our own people is just going to widen those divisive lines.

1145
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:49,000
It's going to weaken us as a country. It's going to weaken our individual people, weakens our economies. And I know that I'm going way past the video game thing here right now, but-

1146
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Ain't no one going to stop you. Go off.

1147
01:38:52,000 --> 01:39:07,000
But all of this together, it's all intertwined. I mean, and then let's go back to that othering. Let's look in the video game industry for othering. How are women treated in multiplayer games once someone finds out that it's a woman?

1148
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Even though we now make up the majority of gamers online. We are the majority now. And I'll go with SSJ100Matt here. The people who claim extremism or supremacy doesn't exist are really quiet after yesterday's tragedy. We've had two back to back now. There was another one.

1149
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:44,000
And yeah, I agree. Take your thoughts and prayers and shove it. Although I do like sending people the gift of this big dark satanic looking altar thing and saying thoughts and prayers. I love that one.

1150
01:39:45,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Oh, Ron was correct. Three. Three, yeah. And then the thing is, is that people need, this is the other thing too. People need to look past their own selfishness. America is built on pure fucking selfishness. Me first. What does this do for me? Pull myself up, pull yourself up by your bootstraps. I'm not helping.

1151
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:42,000
But the moment that we start helping each other, the moment that we start thinking outside of our own narrow point of view, our own narrow blinders, like they put on horses, blinders. When you take off the blinders and you see that there are other people around you, when we start putting it together, it's not that hard of a burden when more people are shouldering it.

1152
01:40:43,000 --> 01:41:07,000
When we start, when the rich white men of the world start looking out to the women and treating them with respect, look out to people who are of a different color than they are. Because I'll be perfectly honest now, this concept of race amongst people, I understand genetically that there, there, there indeed are some differences.

1153
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:14,000
You know, some people are more resistant to being sunburned. Some people are more resistant to other, but we are all human. Huh?

1154
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
As you said, not me.

1155
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Me either.

1156
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I step out of the sun for two seconds. It's like, I got to burn.

1157
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
But it was my example.

1158
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I don't mean to interrupt, but.

1159
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,000
What they're doing is separating us by, by the visual results of our genes.

1160
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Yeah.

1161
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:39,000
They're separating us by the parts of our body. They're separating us by whether we are neuro-typical or neuro-atypical like, like myself.

1162
01:41:40,000 --> 01:42:04,000
It's going to stop when we can break those barriers, when we can respect those things that have formed these people, when we respect that, yes, you had a different upbringing than me because of these economic social factors that are affecting your life because of how the government's trying to police you because of demonization in media.

1163
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:16,000
But I'm not going to look at those things. I am going to see you as a person. I want to know your story and I want to respect that. I believe in equity.

1164
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Equality, you know, that, that, that thing where the people looking over the fence, right? You have the tall person who can see over the fence and then you put the, the, uh, the stool up.

1165
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:34,000
The thing is that you need to lower the fence so that everyone's going to be able to look over that fence the same way.

1166
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Yeah. Why is there a fence? Yeah.

1167
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Well, that's a different story, but I'm getting, I'm getting way off, but I am passionate about this, but I also feel very logical about it.

1168
01:42:47,000 --> 01:43:04,000
For me, this should not be a question of emotion. This should not be a question of what your magic book says. And I say this as a practicing Jewish woman for, and by the way, I pissed off my mother because, and I asked about it.

1169
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:19,000
If carrying a pregnancy is going to negatively impact your quality of life, you will save your life by having the abortion. Ask your rabbi though. Your rabbi may say something different. Mine said that.

1170
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:33,000
But I'm going to leave that there. Just respect people. The moment that you stop seeing women and start seeing human.

1171
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Just respect people. It's all it takes. Understand that the things that we go through, they're different than what you go through. We do have different needs and, uh, access to abortion.

1172
01:43:51,000 --> 01:44:06,000
If you cut that access, all it's going to mean is that there will be unsafe abortions. People will die all because of you and your magic book.

1173
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I want to get to an earlier comment, um, because I think it it's, it's a very apt comment and it also has to do with a lot of this. Um, you know how the gaming industry is responding and this sort of thing. And I think this is worth reading.

1174
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Uh, it's from SSG, one hundred Matt earlier in the chat who says some companies are hesitant to be a part of the story after what happened to Disney, which I get. The thing is that we need folks in power to speak out when detrimental legislation comes through

1175
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:41,000
because it's not going to stop. We can March and protest all we want, but the people in power move the needle while I understand companies for not speaking out, but the folks and companies that do, they have my respect.

1176
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Yeah. And I think that's why so many of us are frustrated that the Senate technically has a majority, but I also asked, do they? Cause I don't think they do. I think we keep sitting here going, Democrats have the Senate and the house and the presidency.

1177
01:44:53,000 --> 01:45:03,000
They don't have the Senate on paper. They have, they don't have the Senate. We all know that, but that's, that's a whole other issue that is getting political. That's a whole other thing, but I do want to, I do want to say one thing.

1178
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Can I quickly finish my thought and that'll go back to you.

1179
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I'm sorry.

1180
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:29,000
That we need the Senate to do, we need the government to do something. We need the, and at least I saw the passion in Elizabeth Warren for sure. And I'm starting to see it in some of the other people as well. It just, we need to take that into actual action and not just talk. Okay. I'm sorry, dark soccer, but I just want to finish that.

1181
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:43,000
You know, one of, one of the podcasts that I listen to regularly is Stuff Mom Never Told You. I adore Annie and Samantha. They're, they're lovely people, but they had a conversation with Melita Easters.

1182
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:49,000
And it's a very good conversation and they do break down a lot of those arguments in Alita's paperwork.

1183
01:45:49,000 --> 01:46:07,000
And if you really want to know, want to hear more of a in-depth discussion about it, I highly recommend that episode. It was last Wednesday's episode. And well, I mean, the podcast is amazing anyway, but I would definitely listen to that episode.

1184
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:14,000
There is a lot of good to be gathered from that one if you want to educate yourself very well.

1185
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
I'll just look up the name of the episode.

1186
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Let's move on with the video games and we're going to cleanse the palette a little bit, but yeah, great, great talk, but we're going to, um, while dark soccer cleanses the palette with a churro.

1187
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:34,000
See there, uh, I'm jealous by the way. That's one of the things I miss after diabetes is churros.

1188
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I made Dan go to Del Taco for me.

1189
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I haven't had a churro and I don't know how long, but anyway, one of these days, one of these days, I'm almost, I'm almost, I can't believe this. I'm almost to 50 pounds lost.

1190
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:51,000
And when I get there, I'm three pounds away. When I get there, I might just have to go to a theme park and have a churro just one time, just one time.

1191
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Anyway. All right. Uh, let's cleanse the palette a little bit by talking about a real train wreck of a video game.

1192
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
And, uh, we'll go to the next story from Loki.

1193
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Yes. So, uh, there was a wonderful video game leak on 4chan. Um, that was the original 2001 build of Duke Nukem Forever.

1194
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:22,000
So this was the one that they showed the E3 videos for. Um, and I may have been actually at E3 at one time.

1195
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Um, it looks pretty good. I mean, honestly, um, but it was confirmed by George Broussard that it does appear to be the actual thing.

1196
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Although he made a point to like, you really need to temper your expectations because there's not really any game to play.

1197
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:48,000
It's just some barely populated test levels and what they kind of showed off during E3.

1198
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:54,000
But honestly, what they showed off, like even with this 2001 demo thing looks pretty good.

1199
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I'm hoping that someone can take this and like, you know, flesh it out to a full fledged 2001 Duke Nukem Forever game or something.

1200
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:12,000
But yeah. And if you want to check it out, you can actually play it because it has been uploaded to the internet archive.

1201
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:22,000
But don't expect much of a game. Like it's, it's, but I think, I think it's an interesting story in what you see at E3 versus reality.

1202
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,000
I think it's a very interesting sort of story with that.

1203
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Yeah. Apogee's founder Scott Miller said, looks like someone leaked a build of our Duke Nukem Forever from 2001.

1204
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Anyone expecting much of a playable game will be disappointed. The game's brilliant trailer from that period definitely overrepresented what the game actually played like.

1205
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
It's a very honest comment.

1206
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Yeah. But yeah.

1207
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:55,000
You know, I don't know. This one of those things where it's like, you know, it's a little weird that something unpublished got leaked, but at the same time, you know, it's so old at this point.

1208
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,000
And I think there's just, there's obviously some fascinating stories there behind the development of this game. It's interesting.

1209
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Bobby Blackwell says, was any of the content from this demo in the gearbox Duke Nukem Forever? Didn't, I mean, didn't they pretty much hit the reset button on the game at some point during development?

1210
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I think they did. This doesn't appear to be either.

1211
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
You know what I want to see is this.

1212
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Duke Nukem Forever.

1213
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,000
And this just looks more polished, which is really bad.

1214
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:38,000
You know what I want to see is this, but for Final Fantasy 13 versus, you know, before it became 15. I want because that's another one where it's like the trailer and the final game kind of aren't the same, you know, so I'd be very curious about that.

1215
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Quest Buster and chat says there was also a little drama when co-founder Scott Miller then blogged how Duke Nukem Forever failed and Broussard shot back because he felt as if you were thrown under a bus.

1216
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Yeah. And as Joe and Matt says, they're really bracing our expectations for a 21 year old demo. Just silly. Yeah. I'm like, we already the game ended up not being great.

1217
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:10,000
So that bar is pretty low to hit for Duke Nukem Forever. Like we all play. Well, some of us played Duke Nukem Forever. It's like, you don't have to do much.

1218
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Even if it's a few test levels that might actually be better than the original.

1219
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Maybe it's the reverse than they think. And people seeing this demo will actually make people realize how much wasn't there and how much still needed to be done.

1220
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:40,000
You know, they have like those they have like those God, there was some newer I think 3D Realms is actually making the games. They had some newer FPS games that were done in that like kind of old Duke Nukem style.

1221
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Like, I kind of wish they would just come back and make a new Duke Nukem game in that style like the old Duke Nukem. None of this like let's make it look modern. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The old one make it like the old one.

1222
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:08,000
All right, well, something else that I wish they would come back and just make another of is f zero. But of course, as we've talked about the last couple weeks on the show, Reggie's going around doing a big book tour right now to support his book and of course a lot of people want to ask him about Nintendo.

1223
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:26,000
So in an interview that he was doing with VentureBeat, Reggie Fils-Aime was asked, why no new f zero. And in a quote, Reggie says, Why was f zero abandoned? The insight I would share is that at least during my tenure, and he's always very good about saying I don't work for Nintendo anymore.

1224
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:42,000
I can only give you you know, from my experience, we get it, we get it, Reggie. At least during my tenure, Nintendo developers were always experimenting with different gameplay styles, always thinking about where a unique experience could be applied back either to an existing franchise or maybe creating a new franchise.

1225
01:51:42,000 --> 01:52:11,000
My bet is that somewhere in the Kyoto development centers, some developers playing around with an idea that might be applied to f zero. It's never a situation, at least in my experience, where the company makes a conscious decision not to continue supporting XYZ franchise. Historically, it just hasn't worked that way. Not when I was there. I don't know if it's intended. But do you know what I hear in that statement is that they couldn't find a way to make the Wii controller compelling for f zero. So there was no f zero Wii.

1226
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
That sounds like it.

1227
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:40,000
They couldn't find a way to make the secondary screen on Wii U compelling for f zero. So they didn't do f zero for the Wii U. We'll ignore the Nintendo Land segment. And so but but now we're what we're on the switch. And it's kind of like, the switches compelling thing is that it's portable. And like that shouldn't be the argument anymore. It's it's like almost like any other console. I mean, I guess you could say that the joy con still detach and move around and all this stuff. But

1228
01:52:40,000 --> 01:53:09,000
yeah, but people are buying it for that gimmicks. They're buying it for the portability. Like they Nintendo needs to understand like you don't need to utilize the joy cons in just make them just controllers. And then if someone wants to utilize that, then they can. It's just like, you know, if let's go with their argument here that they couldn't do anything groundbreaking breaking with that. Nintendo also ignored their 3d component to the 3ds at some point. So like,

1229
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:30,000
you know what made? So what put out another game? You don't have to just it's a racing game just and Bayonetta doesn't do anything but which I'm not knocking a legendary series. I love Bayonetta I will be getting Bayonetta 300% but I don't expect that it's going to do funny things with the joy cons and all that it's just going to be a

1230
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:53,000
not like, honestly, honestly, when they've tried doing that, try to do funny things with the games, we are sitebox trick racing. Like, sometimes we don't need to put a new gimmick into it. Sometimes you can just make a quality game and have it run on your hardware, which is barely what some games can do nowadays on the switch. Because the switch isn't all that powerful. But like, just make a quality fc or game. Just make a quality game.

1231
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Make it look pretty, make it fast, make it, you know, the controls tight, done. That's all you need to do.

1232
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Nintendo to Nintendo's credit, when they do decide to make something compelling for the hardware, they typically knock it out of the park. And I would say Breath of the Wild is a shining example, which of course was was a Wii U game. And I know most people think of it as a switch game, but it was a Wii U game. And you know, everything that they do with this, the slate and everything just is, you know, but anyway, I digress.

1233
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I agree with SSG-100 Matt in chat. So they're overthinking it, just make a game already. It doesn't need to be that compelling. It's F-Zero, we'll buy it. And SSG-100 Matt said, so who at Nintendo thought Metroid Federation Force was compelling, asking for a friend? All of us.

1234
01:54:43,000 --> 01:55:07,000
And orange right says an F-Zero GX port would be great. Yes, like honestly, just put out F-Zero GX with the AX stuff already unlocked, because you're not going to find those machines anymore. And those memory cards don't even work on the switch anyway. And to most people, that is going to be brand fucking new content. Put out F-Zero GX AX in one package on the switch.

1235
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:36,000
It's it's literally getting F-Zero GX a GameCube emulator to work on the switch with a little flag set that the AX stuff is already unlocked. Like I think there's a lot of people play GameCube stuff on my Mac. Yeah, I doubt it would be very hard. I guess I'll go to RetroArch. All right. Anyway, we've talked about some classic games in this segment. So I think it's time to get into a real classic segment here on OLR.

1236
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:57,000
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

1237
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:06,000
But once a month DarkSakura does a classic handheld. So DarkSakura, what is the classic electronic handheld of the month?

1238
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Tamagotchi.

1239
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Oh boy.

1240
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:26,000
So I, I always kind of had the name wrong. I thought Tamagotchi was like for egg friend as in Tomodachi, but instead it's actually like egg watch.

1241
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:46,000
So I was wrong. But it is a handheld digital pet keychain thing that was created by two people. One was Yokoi Akihiro of Wiz and Maita Aki of Bandai.

1242
01:56:46,000 --> 01:57:02,000
It was released by Bandai on November 23, 1996 in Japan and in the US on May 1, 1997. And it was a pretty big fad. I think everyone had one. Like I even remember there was like the Pikachu one. Remember?

1243
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Like the little walker thing that was yellow. I have one of those somewhere. But anyway, the majority of the Tamagotchi were in these little egg shaped video game things with like a couple of buttons on it.

1244
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:32,000
And so Bandai said the name is a portmanteau of Tamago, egg, and Lachi as in watch. So I, I always thought it was for Tomodachi, but I'm wrong.

1245
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Anyway, so both of these people actually won the 1997 I.G. Nobel Prize for Economics as the father and mother of the Tamagotchi.

1246
01:57:51,000 --> 01:58:08,000
You could have like very simple little creatures in it that would evolve. You could discipline your Tamagotchi. If they were bad, you'd have to clean up their poo.

1247
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:25,000
They had a hunger meter. You had to feed them and train them and play with them and you could check their age and their weight like little, like little pets and you could give them a loaf of bread or a hamburger or a snack that was like candy or cake.

1248
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:45,000
And then you could fill up their happy meter by playing games with them and give them snacks. And if they needed to be disciplined, then you would scold them when they're trying, like when they refuse to play or when they want to be fed at the wrong time.

1249
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:59,000
You know, like I said, you also have to clean up their poop. But they make a face before they take a poo. So you can activate a toilet icon and tell them to go potty. And then you can potty train them that way.

1250
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:20,000
So if they get sick, they get a little skull icon and they look kinda happy and then you can give them medicine. Sometimes you have to play more with them or not play more, but give them more medicine to heal them. And usually they won't play or eat when they're sick.

1251
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:41,000
And so they go through different stages of their life cycle. Each stage is for a few amounts of days, depending on the model of Tamagotchi you have. And it plays like a little jingle when it hits a new stage and changes the pet's appearance. They can die because you didn't take care of them or they hit old age or sickness or a predator eats them.

1252
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I didn't know there was a predator.

1253
01:59:44,000 --> 02:00:02,000
As like a later version, but they have baby, child, teenager, and adult, and the later Tamagotchi added seniors. And so, but if you don't take care of them, they can die. If they get super old, they can die and they can reproduce.

1254
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Also, some of the Japanese Tamagotchi have a ghost in the headstone when the pet dies, but the English version shows an angel at death or a UFO, and then a pet laying an egg so it returns to its home planet.

1255
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:47,000
There are also the different versions. There's the Itamago that, of course, connects to this website, Flash Game, and it gives you a code so that you can log into it. And then there's also other models, like the Tamagotchi4u and Tamagotchi4u Plus, that can connect to other Tamagotchi units.

1256
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:59,000
And also smartphones and tablets using NFC communication, but they do not have infrared, so that made them sell poorly.

1257
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:14,000
There's also the different versions. The Mezuchi and Otsuchi Tamagotchi could have marriage and offsprings, and then that came with the Plus connection and the other subsequent models.

1258
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:28,000
So a boy magochi and a lady magochi, I just made up those words, can get their groove on and make baby magochi.

1259
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:38,000
You can also choose to have them marry a random pet brought in by the matchmaker. Like, what century is this, please? Thank you.

1260
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:45,000
You know, matchmaker, matchmaker? Make me a match? Fiddler on the Roof? Hello? Anyway.

1261
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Yes.

1262
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
The, hm?

1263
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
No, I was going to say, yes, I do remember Fiddler on the Roof.

1264
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Yeah, that's my mom's favorite movie, by the way.

1265
02:01:53,000 --> 02:02:00,000
But you can, like, keep breeding your Tamagotchi and then their parents will leave them behind. Oops.

1266
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:13,000
There's the Chōjinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi, also has character families or groups, and these are classifications for the characters that you can obtain in the game, mainly by appearance.

1267
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
They also have certain skills that go with them.

1268
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:25,000
The character of one group cannot grow into an adult of a different group, and if two pets of different groups marry and have an egg, the baby will be the one of the female group.

1269
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:37,000
In Tamagotchi Mix, the latest one, there is a notable change that the Tamagotchi will share genetics from both parents. I think there's, like, an active store in Harajuku that you can still buy Tamagotchi.

1270
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:53,000
There's so many different versions, just so many different mechanics in each of them. There's also the Tamagotchi Pix that has a camera installed, and you get a pet based on your skin tone and age of your face.

1271
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:58,000
And then you can take pictures and take your pet on a walk.

1272
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,000
So there are also video games, so we are getting into Tamagotchi video games.

1273
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,000
God, there's so many different Tamagotchi releases, though.

1274
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
You don't have to read them all.

1275
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Hold on just a second.

1276
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
No, I'm looking at just the various lists of them.

1277
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
How about some chat comments while you look that over real quick?

1278
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
For fuck's sake, there's a bunch.

1279
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:24,000
S2100Matt says, I remember friendships being ruined in school because friends would lend their Tamagotchi to their friends for the weekend, only to have them dead by Monday.

1280
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Home huge Tamagotchi.

1281
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Gadatz in chat has the crying emoji saying, I remember accidentally letting one die.

1282
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I'm sure dead Tamagotchis were very traumatic for an entire generation.

1283
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:43,000
The last new Tamagotchi release was the Moto... I think it's ID or ID.

1284
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Ochi De Tamagotchi Station Plus that only exists with a Tamagotchi ID, and you can communicate three Tamagotchi IDs and have a dance battle.

1285
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
There's also a Tamawaki that's a walkie talkie Tamagotchi.

1286
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Several people in chat are talking about the Pikachu.

1287
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
It was like the Pikachu Walker.

1288
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
A Pikachu Pocket or whatever.

1289
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Yeah, that was it. And they did a color one.

1290
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Now me, I was a Digimon fan.

1291
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:20,000
I always, always ended up with Devimon for some reason.

1292
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I always did.

1293
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:28,000
But there were a handful of games, and I think I can name the games pretty quickly.

1294
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:39,000
So for Game Boy, there was Tamagotchi, Game Dehaken Tamagotchi, Game Dehaken Tamagotchi V2, Tamagotchi Otsuchi Tometsuchi.

1295
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:43,000
On Nintendo 64, Tamagotchi 64, Mina De Tamagotchi World.

1296
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:50,000
PlayStation had Hoshi Dehaken Tamagotchi Saturn had Sega Saturn Dehaken Tamagotchi Park.

1297
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Super Famicom had Tamagotchi Town.

1298
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,000
The DS had Tamagotchi Connection Corner Shop Corner Shop 2.

1299
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
We had Party On.

1300
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:02,000
The DS had Corner Shop 3.

1301
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:06,000
We had Tamagotchi no Furifuri Kagekiran.

1302
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,000
More for the DS, all the rest of these are on the DS.

1303
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Tamagotchi no Nakiri Channel, Tamagotchi no Nakiri Challenge, Tamagotchi Collection, and Ochi Mainichi Tamagotchi.

1304
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
That was for 3DS.

1305
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:26,000
And then there were a bunch of iPhone, Android, and a Windows 95 Tamagotchi CD-ROM.

1306
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
CD-ROM.

1307
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,000
But I mean, there were so many Tamagotchi themed things.

1308
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:36,000
There's a Tamagotchi Boeing 777.

1309
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:44,000
There was the Bandai Tamagotchi statue that was in front of their headquarters in Taito.

1310
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Big Tamagotchi store, Tamagotchi anime.

1311
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:54,000
That was where the Dehaken series came from.

1312
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Anime TV Dehaken Tamagotchi.

1313
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,000
It basically means found on anime TV Tamagotchi.

1314
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:07,000
There was also Saiko Tamagotchi, which is Hey, Let's Go! Tamagotchi.

1315
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
All kinds of stuff.

1316
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:16,000
There was animated videos, there was music, all kinds of shit.

1317
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:22,000
And then there were the other... I'll talk about them.

1318
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
There was a Pokemon Pikachu digital pet.

1319
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
There was a Tatukibako, which also came out by Bandai.

1320
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:35,000
There is a psychological effect named after Tamagotchi called Tamagotchi Effect.

1321
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
I'm now very curious about that.

1322
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:44,000
It has to deal with emotional attachments with machines, robots, or software agents.

1323
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:47,000
There's one called P.O.L.E.

1324
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Pixel checks, one for girls.

1325
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Fin Fin on Teo the Magic Planet.

1326
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
There was Giga Pets. I remember Giga Pets.

1327
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
I had a Giga Pet too.

1328
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
That was by Tiger.

1329
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,000
And then, of course, Bandai also made Digimon.

1330
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:09,000
All these people who were trying to say Tamagotchi and Digimon competing, blah, blah, blah.

1331
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
They made Digimon too, as well.

1332
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
The money all went to the same account.

1333
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:20,000
And Digimon gave us the fantastic anime, of which I only count two of them.

1334
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
And then Digimon Tri, because they were amazing.

1335
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Digimon Zero 2 is the best of the series. I will leave it there.

1336
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
But I have my Digimon.

1337
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:33,000
And he always turned into a Devilmon.

1338
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
That's the end.

1339
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Tamagotchi, the classic electronic handheld of the month.

1340
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I think many of you know this, obviously.

1341
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Because it defined a generation in many ways, as far as gaming goes.

1342
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:48,000
So, a little look back on Tamagotchi.

1343
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:55,000
And how many of you first let a pet die from neglect?

1344
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
It was Tamagotchi. I learned that lesson.

1345
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Well, if it was the Pikachu one, Pikachu would just run away.

1346
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Yeah, yeah. Pikachu never dies.

1347
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Pikachu never dies.

1348
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,000
We're running a little long, so I want to make sure we get through our next few segments.

1349
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:15,000
So, let's just get right into our rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other news in the industry.

1350
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
So, Loki.

1351
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Yeah, Star Fields got delayed.

1352
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,000
So, you know, that was expected.

1353
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:26,000
But yeah, it's coming out now in 2023.

1354
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
So, that's not going to be coming as well.

1355
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:32,000
And Redfall, which is a game I completely forgot about.

1356
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I guess the new Arkane Austin game.

1357
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,000
That is also coming out in the first half of 2023.

1358
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
You know, I was looking forward to Star Field.

1359
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I really want to play Star Field, but I don't want him to crunch.

1360
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
I want the game to be good.

1361
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Like, it is what it is. Whatever.

1362
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,000
I just kind of wonder what Microsoft's holiday tentpole is now.

1363
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Because I thought this was going to be it.

1364
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
So, does that mean Fable's ready for this year?

1365
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Or are they going to try to invest in something else?

1366
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
I don't know.

1367
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:01,000
I'm just curious what the marketing strategy ends up being now that this gets delayed.

1368
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I think this was their big tentpole for the holiday.

1369
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
So, kind of curious where that goes now.

1370
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Yeah, no idea.

1371
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:12,000
And then, in other news, data miners have dug through Nintendo Switch Sports.

1372
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:18,000
And have found that there are 28 unlockable collections so far in that.

1373
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:25,000
And 28 collections, meaning possibly over a year support for the game.

1374
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Half of them have been named and the other half have placeholder names.

1375
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,000
There's one for each sport as well as random themes like ice cream, cute, and luxury.

1376
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
I have no idea what the collections are for.

1377
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Is that like clothing or something in that?

1378
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I thought it was actual sports games.

1379
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I was like, oh man, they're adding 28 more sports things.

1380
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Oh yeah, it appears to be just like cosmetics.

1381
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Woohoo, cosmetics.

1382
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Hey, some people are into that.

1383
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
That's true.

1384
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Some people have a bunch of cosmetics for survivors in Dead by Daylight and they don't play survivor.

1385
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
I don't know who that is though.

1386
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
That person's a bitch.

1387
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I would never out them on this show.

1388
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:11,000
All right, anyway, speaking of said individual, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us next?

1389
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Okay, so Alan Wake remastered his coming to the Switch this fall.

1390
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Digital only and runs natively on Switch hardware so it's not emulated.

1391
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Woot.

1392
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:36,000
And then Multiversis has a closed alpha set for May 19th through the 27th.

1393
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:43,000
So if you want to play it, better go to the website.

1394
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
All right, get on it.

1395
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:50,000
I'll sign up for it, why not?

1396
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Why not?

1397
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1398
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
What's coming out a little sooner than Starfield?

1399
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Loki, what's coming out this week in the US?

1400
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Not a whole lot.

1401
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:10,000
So we've got Dead Craft on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1402
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:16,000
And then Vampire the Masquerade Swan Song with excellent box art with a bloody swan.

1403
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,000
It's like a swan with blood splatters on it.

1404
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,000
That's it.

1405
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,000
All right.

1406
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Well, let's go to Japan and check out the releases there.

1407
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:30,000
We have on the Switch, Snow Brothers Special is out on the Nintendo Switch,

1408
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:34,000
which I think is like an old school arcade game that's still going on.

1409
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Yeah, Snow Brothers.

1410
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
We love Snow Brothers in this house.

1411
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Yeah, no, there's a new Switch game coming out in Japan this week.

1412
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
I don't know if this is something getting ported over here,

1413
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:47,000
but it's that same arcade series from back in the day with a cartoony look now.

1414
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
So that's interesting.

1415
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
So that is coming out this week.

1416
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:57,000
We have Taiko Rishiren 5 DX is out as well on the Switch this week.

1417
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
That is a remake, though, by the way.

1418
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:03,000
And let's see, I think those are the big releases on the Switch this week in Japan.

1419
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Checking out the PlayStation 5.

1420
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:12,000
The Ascent has a release in Japan this week, even though that is still the English localized version.

1421
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,000
And that is really the big release on the PS5 this week.

1422
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:21,000
So we'll move on to Europe, Dark Sakura.

1423
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Just a sec, because my browser decided to be a butthole.

1424
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
OK, there we go.

1425
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:36,000
So we also have on the 19th, we have Vampire the Masquerade, Swan Song.

1426
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:39,000
This has like different artwork on it, I guess, for Europe.

1427
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:43,000
We have Call of the Sea for PlayStation.

1428
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,000
We have Castaway Paradise for Switch.

1429
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Luxo XXL on Switch.

1430
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,000
The PlayStation Angry Alligator.

1431
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
I'm sorry, on PlayStation Angry Alligator on Switch.

1432
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Jigsaw Fun Wonderful Nature.

1433
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
And also Jigsaw Fun Greatest Cities.

1434
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:05,000
PlayStation Switch Mickey Storm and the Cursed Mask.

1435
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
We also have King Leo.

1436
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Also on the 19th, End Zone A World Apart Survivor Edition.

1437
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:18,000
And on the 20th, we have Dolmen on PlayStation and Xbox.

1438
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
All right.

1439
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
We have some more news stories coming your way.

1440
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:25,000
In fact, we have a few extra tonight because I screwed up making the show roll tonight.

1441
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:28,000
But hey, that's all right. You get a little extra OLR tonight.

1442
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,000
So why don't we get into it? Loki.

1443
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Yeah, so there's a class action lawsuit against Wada Games for their slow response, I should say.

1444
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Not eWada Games. Not to be confused with a legendary...

1445
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Wada Games, the company that does video game grading.

1446
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
There was a few articles a while back about like, you know,

1447
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Super Mario 64 selling for a large amount of money and stuff like that.

1448
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:02,000
I mean, aside from all of the, you know, heritage auction shenanigans that they've been doing since both companies,

1449
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:11,000
I think you're owned by the same individuals or they're, you know, working together to basically inflate the collector game market.

1450
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:14,000
So there's that.

1451
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
But this is not actually about that.

1452
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:19,000
It's about how long it's taking them to grade these games,

1453
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:28,000
because Wada charges fees to expedite the process and a commission of two percent on games valued over twenty five hundred dollars.

1454
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:39,000
However, their expedite process isn't very expedited and some folks are getting their games back after being in their possession for 18 months.

1455
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Which is ridiculous.

1456
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:48,000
And mind you that these guys, absolute geniuses that they are at Wada Games are even opening up grading for modern games now.

1457
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:56,000
So like how how are you going to do that when you can't even handle like what you have already?

1458
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,000
You know, that's been like it. I don't know.

1459
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:05,000
I don't know how they're going to pull that off when they can't even grade the stuff that they've had for like several years now.

1460
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I'm sure that there's going to be more investigations into them outside of this.

1461
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:20,000
But, you know, obviously I would say that the them being slow to grade games is the least of my concerns as far as this company.

1462
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:26,000
It's more of the artificial inflation of the value of the market because they're selling to themselves.

1463
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,000
They I mean, they are basically grading.

1464
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:36,000
They're saying that the games are worth this much and then selling it to themselves so that the market goes, oh, wow.

1465
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Mario's worth that much now. I'm going to sell my seal copies and stuff.

1466
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:53,000
So it's it's a big old mess. But, you know, at least they're getting in trouble for just not being able to fill their basic.

1467
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:59,000
You know, their basic services that they've offered.

1468
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,000
It's that whole that we knew something was fishy with that auction thing from the very beginning.

1469
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:08,000
And now I like that this kind of lays it out, though, with that, you know, big length of time and all that stuff.

1470
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,000
So it's really interesting to see what the courts do about this whole thing.

1471
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:20,000
So but chances are your copy of Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt isn't worth as much as some of these things would leave you to believe it is.

1472
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Yeah, but there are there are some video games that are worth plenty of money, like the stadium events.

1473
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:31,000
And that's like before Nintendo bought it from Bandai. That's legit. But yeah, it's it's hard to find those anymore.

1474
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:40,000
All right. Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, you know, kind of the newer end of games and games coming out on subscription services,

1475
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:47,000
namely another comment on why PlayStation five first party games are not coming out on PlayStation Plus,

1476
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:52,000
because a lot of folks are saying, oh, PlayStation Plus, they want the money answer to Xbox Game Pass.

1477
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:58,000
And it's I mean, it's it's it's not the equivalent. We know that it is something that looks hilarious.

1478
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Had to do what was hilarious is like literally until you mentioned PlayStation Plus again, I for completely forgot that they had that service out there.

1479
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Like I remember games pass, but like I completely forgot PlayStation Plus.

1480
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Well, their PlayStation had the PlayStation now stuff and all that. I completely forgot that they even happen in a couple of weeks.

1481
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:21,000
The whole really, really relaunches come in. So, you know, look out for that with the cloud streaming.

1482
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:26,000
So, you know, I am so looking out for that. It'll be interesting to see what happens.

1483
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Anyhow, so the chief financial officer of Sony Hiroki Totoki didn't mention Microsoft by name, but we all know about Xbox Game Pass.

1484
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Right. So in a comment on a recent financial call, this is a translation by Genki JPN on Twitter.

1485
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:55,000
If we distribute first party games on the subscription services, we may need to shrink the investment needed for quality products.

1486
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
That will deteriorate the first party title quality. That is our concern.

1487
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Our current thinking is to have development costs and appropriate R&D investment for quality products, which will improve the platform and improve business in the long run.

1488
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Now, I know not everybody's going to like this comment I'm about to say, but I'm telling you it's the truth.

1489
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Sony feels that they can play it this way because the market is letting them because Sony is still leading in many ways.

1490
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Over Microsoft, Microsoft has been having to bring something unique and a new value type of thing to the table because they have been lagging behind.

1491
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Ever since they've the Xbox one launch was fucked so hard by dog matric.

1492
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:48,000
And, you know, a lot of the incompetency that surrounded the release of that system, even if some of it ironically was ahead of its time, it didn't match the current time.

1493
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:54,000
And we all know the Xbox one and the mandatory connect as the biggest mistake Microsoft ever made was mandating connect in the Xbox one.

1494
02:18:54,000 --> 02:19:02,000
But I digress is that it put them behind in the race and they've been having to play catch up ever since.

1495
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:12,000
So I think Sony is able to kind of get away with this because if they put God of War out for 60 bucks, they put Horizon Forbidden West out for 60 bucks.

1496
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
They put these types of things out for 60 bucks.

1497
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:23,000
70. Oh, yeah, you're right. Sorry. 70 bucks. Excuse. Excuse me. Yes. 70 bucks. People are still going to buy it and they're going to buy it in mass.

1498
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Well, I think they're also playing it conservatively because they I think I think they can they can basically put this out now the way it is without the first party titles in there.

1499
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:45,000
And then if Game Pass just utterly destroys them, they could put out the first party tiles and go, look, fans, we've been listening to you.

1500
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:51,000
See, we love you guys. We put out first party titles now. I don't know, but I don't think it would be like that at all.

1501
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:59,000
I think first party titles are still going to go on the service 18 months after they release when they would be given away as PlayStation anyway.

1502
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:13,000
But it's yeah, that would be stupid, though. But like, it's going to be this may not be a problem right now there, but they're thinking very it's very much short sighted because, you know, Microsoft has all of these studios now.

1503
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:25,000
And I mean, once these studios start developing stuff and like putting out these products, that's going to be a problem because right now they have some really quality games over their first party for at Sony.

1504
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:35,000
And Microsoft has had a few things, but it's been like kind of hit or miss with some of that stuff. But then they're going to really start cranking out those first party tiles and they're not going to be able to make that argument anymore.

1505
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:46,000
And it's just going to be. But they could still pivot and adjust their service, but they get it later if they feel the need to, or maybe they just don't think it's going to make a difference.

1506
02:20:47,000 --> 02:21:00,000
So at that point, we also know Microsoft is no longer as much about Xbox as they are about game pass. They want to sell more game pass subscriptions than they do Xbox is that is Microsoft's like environment now.

1507
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:09,000
And that's fine. I don't think Sony is at that same pivot yet. Because again, they're still profitable in the hardware industry, they're still profitable.

1508
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:22,000
So the market is not forcing them to evolve. And quite frankly, I think when PS5 VR comes out, it's just going to dig their heels in even more. I'm not sure they're they're going to pivot as quick as we all think they ought to.

1509
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I think a pivot for them to start including first party titles is going to be years away. And even then, I don't think it's going to happen the way you said Loki where it's like, Oh, we're listening, it's going to be one game is suddenly there's one big must have game that goes on the service day one.

1510
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:45,000
And then that's like the thing that starts the floodgate. But again, I think we're years away from that. Hey, that happens anytime soon.

1511
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:53,000
As they've been trying to play PlayStation now work for the longest time, and I don't think that's been really adopted. I don't think anyone cares about it.

1512
02:21:53,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Well, actually, so Matt says there's a story that came out that more folks are subscribed to PlayStation plus 48 million subscribers per Sony, then game pass 25 million per Microsoft, but only about 3.2 million for PS now, the market is off center now, but it will be a war soon enough.

1513
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:32,000
There's a while your numbers, I'm not going to debate the numbers as you and her Mac is it's very true. There's a huge element here that people tend to overlook when they're putting those numbers side by side. And that is the entire country of Japan. Because Microsoft has not penetrated Japan to he at all the way they tried to for years and basically gave up on.

1514
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Did you say though that they're comparing PlayStation plus with Xbox Live?

1515
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Are we talking games pass?

1516
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Okay, well, you can't compare those because PlayStation plus you need to have for online access to PlayStation games. So if you're completely ignoring Xbox Live, your numbers are skewed.

1517
02:22:53,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Yeah. I'll be curious what those numbers look like in the US and in Europe. About six months, like we'll say this holiday season. I want to see what those numbers look like this holiday season in the US and Europe. No disrespect to Japan. Love y'all. But we all know Microsoft is a non factor in Japan and continues to be I'm not sure why that is. I would have thought Phil Spencer would have tried to remedy that by now. But that might that might be knowing him and the way he's playing the long game.

1518
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:50,000
That might be something he's going to address with the next Xbox, whatever that is, the series Z, I don't know, whatever, whatever that is. But we all know Microsoft is a non factor in Japan. So you can't put those numbers next to each other. So I'd be curious what it looks like in the US and Europe in about six months. So yeah, Mike Dev to chat says I'm more compelled to keep game pass than I am PlayStation plus same. I still don't have a PlayStation five. Again, I will. I'm not a Sony hater by any means. I love Sony. I just I don't need one to play.

1519
02:23:51,000 --> 02:24:10,000
The current games because they all still play on PS four. I will buy a PlayStation five when Final Fantasy 16 is out. We are still thinking of getting a stream deck thing. Oh, yeah, this this steam deck, steam deck. Sorry, I have stream decks. I have two of those. No, I want I'm leaning back.

1520
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:39,760
I want one of those now too. But I like my PlayStation five reservation. Now I want to wait for a hardware refresh. Because those things are only going to get better with time. So that's kind of where that's where my brain's at currently. Dijarama s says the Xbox Series S and x is actually selling well in Japan. I think that's an easy headline to write. Like because honestly, selling correct selling one console is selling more than zero. No, no, he's actually correct. They

1521
02:24:39,760 --> 02:25:07,840
are actually pretty good sellers there. It was the initial Xbox. With the current one, they're actually doing better at catering to the market. Hmm. But how? What's the rate? I mean, and this is I don't expect anyone to have these numbers handy. But again, I it's selling well, because the others didn't sell. So I would be curious what the ratio is of Xbox to Sony in Japan versus the ratio of Xbox to Sony here and in Europe, because I bet it's still pretty low. But I mean, good. Good.

1522
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:19,440
2.3 million units in. Hold on, let me get to it. I hate cookies so much. Except real cookies.

1523
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:29,280
Real cookies are great unless they have stealth raisins. Apparently the Xbox 360 actually sold a

1524
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:44,320
bit better. But right now sales for the Xbox Series XS was at 142,024. But this is as of

1525
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:55,520
March this year. It was the Xbox 360 was the best seller in Japan. And that mostly has to do with

1526
02:25:55,760 --> 02:26:01,040
with Dead or Alive and Star Ocean. That's but that's compared to millions of PlayStations.

1527
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:05,600
So I'm just I just I feel like it's not a fair comparison to Japan. I mean, good, good that

1528
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:09,360
Microsoft's gaining a little ground because I think they've earned that that ability. But I

1529
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:13,760
think it will take a little more investment in Japanese developed games to get there. Microsoft

1530
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:19,520
isn't buying any Japanese studios yet. I know everybody expects them to. But anyway, that's

1531
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:24,080
that's a topic for another day. Let's move on. Let's talk about something else with Microsoft

1532
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:26,160
and our Sakura. Something else they're doing well, right?

1533
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:36,160
Well, you know, I'm all about accessibility. And we did have their adaptive adaptive mouse

1534
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:42,160
that actually their adaptive controller that we had talked about so that people could play

1535
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:47,440
could play their games and enjoy everything on Xbox. Well, now they have an extended range of

1536
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:55,360
accessibility accessories. They have actually been partnering with the disability community

1537
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:00,800
to make these and make them work. There's an adaptive mouse, adaptive buttons and an

1538
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:09,920
adaptive hub so that you can augment these items with 3D printed accessories so that you can

1539
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:15,600
customize them in ways that will best fit you. For example, for the adaptive mouse, it can

1540
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:21,920
you can customize it with a thumb support and a tail extension or 3D printed tails.

1541
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:29,600
With the adaptive hub, it can replace or augment a traditional keyboard.

1542
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:37,120
They had one of the adaptive buttons that was concave and it had like different switches on

1543
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:43,040
them. And the the person who they showed using it was actually born without her right forearm

1544
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:51,600
and was using it pretty effectively. The mouse actually looks kind of comfortable, except I've

1545
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:59,200
I mean, for those who were on watching live, I have to use a thumb track ball. But I mean,

1546
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:05,280
it's it's it's a step in the right direction. The thing is, is that these do need to be affordable

1547
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:14,000
for the community and not just like they need to have some sort of subsidy for the

1548
02:28:16,400 --> 02:28:22,800
for, I would say, like lower income or maybe even for businesses to have these to adapt to their

1549
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:30,720
employees who may have a physical disability. That's something Mike Depp points out in chat,

1550
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:34,880
too, is that good on Microsoft for this, but those adaptive peripherals need to be a bit cheaper

1551
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:39,680
or more affordable, rather. Yeah. And.

1552
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:47,760
They're like I'm I was looking at a few other people with other limitations

1553
02:28:48,480 --> 02:28:53,520
and these these things look pretty good. I mean, I have to say.

1554
02:28:56,560 --> 02:29:00,960
It's a little bit sad that they are just now doing something like this.

1555
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:06,960
And other companies in the computer industry that I shall not name

1556
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:12,240
have had switch controls and other adaptive technologies out well before this.

1557
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:16,240
But I think it's a it's a it's a good start for them.

1558
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:22,240
All right. I look forward to it. I'd like to try some of these.

1559
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:26,800
Seems really interesting. All right. Let's move on to our next story from Loki.

1560
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:35,200
Yeah, so we talked about all these other companies having allegations of worker harassment

1561
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:40,240
and whatnot. Well, we talked a little bit about Nintendo, I think it was a few weeks ago,

1562
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:45,600
how there is some former employees that filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint

1563
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:53,760
against Nintendo alleging that they had surveilled course and retaliated against

1564
02:29:53,760 --> 02:30:01,280
the individuals. But of course, they have been very quiet as far as acknowledging any of this

1565
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:11,600
stuff. So. We're waiting, I guess, to see what Nintendo does with this. I don't know,

1566
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:18,080
like basically they're saying that, you know. Doug Bowser, I guess, made a comment,

1567
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:23,120
but not really necessarily addressing it, saying that, you know, like many of you,

1568
02:30:23,120 --> 02:30:28,480
the executive leadership team and I find that many of these points troubling and we're working

1569
02:30:28,480 --> 02:30:36,560
closely to reviewing the content. That Nintendo's executives added that the company has a zero

1570
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:41,920
tolerance for inappropriate conduct, including harassment, discrimination or intimidation.

1571
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:47,520
Yeah, but you say that, but like, I don't know. But is it actually being done?

1572
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:55,600
Yeah, it's a good reminder that like, you know, we have to like, typically the news cycle,

1573
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:58,960
it's like, you know, oh, it's all over everywhere. And then a lot of companies will kind of ignore

1574
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:02,640
it until it goes away. So it's like this kind of coming back kind of reminds people, hey,

1575
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:06,560
wait a minute. Nintendo hasn't really done anything. But I wonder if it's going to end up

1576
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:10,880
because wasn't it? Didn't a legal thing come out of that? I thought so. I wonder if it's not going

1577
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:15,440
to be something that they have a complaint. I don't know if they follow the lawsuit yet,

1578
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:20,720
but like, it would be up for that board to like the governing body to investigate them.

1579
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:23,760
And if they found something, then I would assume it'd be like Activision.

1580
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:28,560
Well, Ramah has a great point, too. This is a lot with the temp agency. So Ramah says that's because

1581
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:32,800
a lot of this is being handled by temp agencies and they're blowing smoke up Nintendo's ass. And

1582
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:37,840
I think that's absolutely true. That's a very unique element to this situation is that, you

1583
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:42,800
know, and we talked at length about the whole, you know, struggle of the temp workers, especially in

1584
02:31:42,800 --> 02:31:47,520
the gaming industry, you know, a few weeks ago when this first came up. But yeah, it is another

1585
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:52,480
interesting little because it allows Nintendo to kind of pass the buck, even though it's,

1586
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:59,600
it's still your workplace, Nintendo. It's still your, you can do or not do whatever you want.

1587
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:04,480
Anyway. All right. Well, let's talk about something. I think a lot of people are looking

1588
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:12,240
forward to. Dr. Sakura. Well, I watched the trailers.

1589
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:19,200
I have thoughts. What trailers? For Resident Evil live action series on Netflix.

1590
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:28,240
It does not seem like it follows any established canon other than having things in common,

1591
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:36,000
like locations and zombies. But it could be good as long as I tell myself it's not Resident Evil.

1592
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:44,160
It looked like it would be a good show. This is also not to be confused with the adaptation,

1593
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:47,520
the CG adaptation that came out on Netflix last year, starring Leon.

1594
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:56,080
Or I need to watch it. I've watched the CG movies, the degeneration. I mostly got that because

1595
02:32:56,800 --> 02:33:04,800
um, uh, one of my favorite singers, uh, did the end song from it. Um, and then, uh, there's also

1596
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:11,840
that live action movie reboot that has nothing to do with Netflix coming out. So we'll see.

1597
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:16,960
I don't know, but it looks, it looks good as long as it's not Resident Evil.

1598
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:20,720
But I have to know, does Master Chief has sex in it?

1599
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:24,400
What does that have to do with Resident Evil?

1600
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:26,960
Because the series is going on right now.

1601
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:34,240
The joke is that it's the Halo TV series. The, I don't know if it's a show runner,

1602
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:39,040
somebody that's high up in the process of making that show basically bragged that like,

1603
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:43,440
we didn't even pay attention to the games. We didn't find out any information about it

1604
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:48,080
whatsoever because we want to craft our own unique storyline. And it sucks. It's absolutely

1605
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:52,080
terrible because they didn't follow any of the lore or anything that has to do with the show.

1606
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:55,680
Whereas this also looks kind of similar. That's like,

1607
02:33:55,680 --> 02:34:01,200
well, it's sort of Resident Evil, but it's not really Resident Evil type of thing.

1608
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:04,240
It sounds like it might be a thing that just explores something the games have it because

1609
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:08,720
Tiger Claw says, I think this live action series mostly focuses on Albert Wesker's kids. Well,

1610
02:34:08,720 --> 02:34:13,680
is that something that the games have released? So my kids in the game, he was alone. Yeah. So

1611
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:18,800
it's like, it's no, then that's a whole other thing. It's like trying to craft a new part of

1612
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:22,400
the universe that hasn't really been explored, which the inverse I can think of, because we

1613
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:26,960
usually see that done games for movies. And I think of like the Jurassic park telltale

1614
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:32,320
game from a few years ago where they tried to turn the, do you remember the very first

1615
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:37,600
Jurassic park Nedry draw? He's he stole the embryos from the other company or whatever,

1616
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:40,640
or, you know, he stole the embryos from Jurassic park and then they, when he died,

1617
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:44,800
the can fell into the river or whatever it was. Right. And that was the last you saw of it.

1618
02:34:44,800 --> 02:34:51,440
Well, the, the, the PC games kind of try to build a whole storyline out of what happened to that can

1619
02:34:52,480 --> 02:34:57,840
and that's where the PC gives us. So that way you weren't expecting Laura Dern because,

1620
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:01,840
which is a shame because Laura Dern should be in everything, but you weren't expecting that

1621
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:05,120
because this is a whole other part of the universe that hadn't really been explored.

1622
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:09,520
But I should also point out those games weren't as well received as most of tell tales, other games.

1623
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:19,840
So, so save though, that as a Marvel comics fan, I'm okay with alternate universes as long as it

1624
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:25,520
tells a good story. I'm I'm definitely okay with multiverses after seeing everything everywhere

1625
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:30,640
all at once, but I hear if I need to see that it's so I'll go see it again. We'll go. Okay. Let's

1626
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:36,560
go see it. For me to understand, isn't that funny? I won't like, I won't watch Dr. Strange,

1627
02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:40,480
but I'll go see everything everywhere all at once again. That's so, that's so me. I'll see

1628
02:35:40,480 --> 02:35:45,120
one movie in the theater 500 times, Rocky horror, but I can't be bothered to see like,

1629
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:53,440
want to see that, but people are saying that it reminds them of drag me to hell. And I hated that

1630
02:35:53,440 --> 02:36:00,560
movie. I'm more, I left that movie with regret. I've never seen drag me to hell. I liked it. It

1631
02:36:00,560 --> 02:36:05,680
reminded me, I follow all the MCU stuff, but it's a very Sam Raimi movie. I mean,

1632
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:10,320
it reminded me like Sam Raimi movies, but I hated drag me to hell. Is it true? You have to

1633
02:36:10,320 --> 02:36:14,640
watch all of Wanda vision to get it because I haven't seen any of that. No, not necessarily.

1634
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:22,000
I mean, some of it, the only thing from Wanda vision that you have to know is that she manifests

1635
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:28,240
her kids in Wanda vision. And then obviously, because it was a spell that she did and she

1636
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:33,920
decided the free, the town she was in, her kids are gone. And so now she's looking for

1637
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:36,720
three VL just said the exact same thing. What were you gonna say to our soccer?

1638
02:36:39,520 --> 02:36:44,240
If you read old Avengers comics too, the same thing happened. They're kind of sorta,

1639
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:47,680
except they ended up being part of Mafisto, which I don't think has anything to do with movies.

1640
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:53,440
I haven't read any comics since I was, but it has to do with, I know it has to do with

1641
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:58,560
the Darkhold. Yes, the Darkhold is very much in it. The Darkhold fuck shit up.

1642
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,960
Some of you are going to take issue with what I'm about to say, but I won't give a fuck. This

1643
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:09,040
is years ago. This is teenage Rob. I really read DC way more than Marvel back in the day

1644
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:16,960
because I was a big Batman fan. So, and I like Superman, so sorry about it. But 15 year old

1645
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:23,520
Rob makes no apologies. All right. Speaking of a company that won't make any apologies, Loki.

1646
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:31,840
Well, I don't know if this is necessarily about apologies, but it's Epic Games has

1647
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:37,600
managed to get a cheat seller to pay them for undisclosed damages.

1648
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:43,600
I left out a very important word in the story sidebar, man. I made mistakes tonight. That's

1649
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:48,160
all right. It's supposed to say Fortnite cheat seller must pay Epic Games. Go ahead.

1650
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:54,160
Fortnite must pay Epic Games. They do that every time.

1651
02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:57,360
Oh God, people are looking at the thumbnail for the show right now thinking we're

1652
02:37:58,160 --> 02:38:00,560
just not with it. I'm going to change that right now.

1653
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:08,400
It's like that co-commercial where they're suing themselves. So yes, apparently there is a guy

1654
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:17,040
that was online. Brandon Despotakis, I guess he had infringed on Epic Games copyright and violated

1655
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:24,560
I guess the EULA for Fortnite because he was creating, you know, aimbots designed to help

1656
02:38:24,560 --> 02:38:34,320
people cheat in Fortnite and also accounts loaded with skins and V-Bucks. And apparently he had to,

1657
02:38:34,880 --> 02:38:40,800
of course, they ordered him to stop selling the software and Froze's assets, which he had looks

1658
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:50,160
like about a quarter million dollars worth of assets. And of course, you know, he now has to

1659
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:54,400
pay them. And what's nice though is they're actually going to be donating that money to

1660
02:38:54,400 --> 02:39:03,840
Child's Play because they don't need his pittance when they're making their Epic money with Fortnite.

1661
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:11,600
Oh boy. I mean, this Fortnite just keeps getting bigger and bigger and it's no surprise that,

1662
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:15,520
you know, people want to try to make a quick buck off at one way or other, whether it's cheating or

1663
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:19,120
whatever it is. It's just interesting that now this kind of stuff kind of like ends up in court,

1664
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:21,200
you know? Yeah.

1665
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:27,200
Yeah. I'm sure there'll be resolution through our expedient justice system in about 16 years.

1666
02:39:27,200 --> 02:39:28,240
So we'll see. Australia.

1667
02:39:28,240 --> 02:39:31,440
We'll see. Oh, it's Australia. Oh, nevermind. Then something might really happen.

1668
02:39:31,440 --> 02:39:37,120
So they've already filed the court documents earlier this month. So that's already done.

1669
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:42,640
All right. I got one more story before we get to the listener round table. And speaking of our

1670
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:47,120
Discord server where you can actually join if you want to give us a call tonight in our green room

1671
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:51,120
over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1672
02:39:51,760 --> 02:39:55,280
Another thing you can do in Discord is you can talk to us throughout the week about stories

1673
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:59,040
that are going on. And this is one that was getting a lot of chat going on in our channel.

1674
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:06,720
And this is one of those... It's a mess. And it's a mess of someone kind of put their foot in their

1675
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:12,880
mouth and they quickly regretted it because they learned how fast sometimes news can spread like

1676
02:40:12,880 --> 02:40:20,000
wildfire. So let me try to summarize what was going on here. So Daniel Lindholm, who is a

1677
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:25,120
composer for the Street Fighter series, he made an offhanded comment that Fei Long is never going

1678
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:30,560
to come back to the series. He was doing a YouTube Q&A, which it's down, but you know,

1679
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:35,280
once on the internet, always on the internet. And he said that... So he went on YouTube to do like

1680
02:40:35,280 --> 02:40:41,600
an ask me anything about Street Fighter. I worked on the soundtrack, which he should have kept his

1681
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:48,800
answers to music and soundtrack. Although, well, to be fair, somebody kind of gotcha'd him a little

1682
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:53,120
bit with this question, I think, but I just think he should have known what roads not to go down in

1683
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:58,720
his answer. So a character that I know we won't see at all, and there's been a lot of discussion

1684
02:40:58,720 --> 02:41:04,080
about it. I mentioned earlier a character I would like to rewrite the music for, so that part is

1685
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:11,120
true, would be Fei Long. I do have other sources, not only Capcom, but friends of mine in the US

1686
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:15,200
who are very close friends with the Lee family. And they have basically said that any kind of

1687
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:20,000
resemblance to Mr. Bruce Lee is now omitted for comedic effect, comic stuff. It needs to be

1688
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:26,320
honorable. That's why we won't see Fei Long again ever. And he really put his foot in his

1689
02:41:26,320 --> 02:41:30,720
mouth on that because now he's saying he was speaking on a hypothetical language,

1690
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:35,520
or excuse me, a hypothetical level. And he had sources close to the Lee family,

1691
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:43,520
but not really from Capcom. And here's the thing though, and this is the part that doesn't click

1692
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:51,600
for me. With all respect to the Lee family and the cinematic legend that Bruce Lee and for many

1693
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:58,800
of us, Jason Lee were, they don't really get a say because we have the right to have parodies.

1694
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:05,200
That's part of free speech and having parody. We're talking about Weird Al earlier in this show.

1695
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:09,360
He's allowed to cover other people's songs and his own lyrics because it's parody.

1696
02:42:10,160 --> 02:42:15,280
He does respect them enough to ask. As I was about to say, he does get permission

1697
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:20,800
and he doesn't put it out unless he gets that permission. I think with one exception,

1698
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:26,160
he put out that Gaga parody, but that was a whole other thing because Gaga never gave,

1699
02:42:26,800 --> 02:42:30,960
never said, I don't want to do it. It was her people. And when she kind of found out,

1700
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:34,720
she was like, I wish they told me about this because I see it as a rite of passage and I

1701
02:42:34,720 --> 02:42:40,480
would have absolutely said yes. But I digress. My point is he does get permission. He doesn't

1702
02:42:40,480 --> 02:42:44,960
have to. He just does that because he's actually a nice guy in the industry, but he doesn't have to.

1703
02:42:44,960 --> 02:42:50,560
But you've probably all heard the buzz about Coolio didn't care for it at first, but they've

1704
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:55,040
made nice since then. Okay, let's not drag that out another 20 years. And there have been people

1705
02:42:55,040 --> 02:43:02,400
that have said no. Michael Jackson said no to a black or white parody. Although some of Weird Al's

1706
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:07,760
most known, um, parodies are, uh, of Michael Jackson's songs, like eat it and things like

1707
02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:13,040
that. Right. Because of the message of the song and also, uh, Paul McCartney wouldn't let him do

1708
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:19,280
chicken pot pie. Right. Right. Because he's a vegetarian. So, so, but, but, but Weird Al could

1709
02:43:19,280 --> 02:43:26,080
do those things without, and we've seen, we've seen many drag queens do parodies with X, like

1710
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:31,200
lady bunny will do songs with extremely explicit song lyrics in the place. And she can do it

1711
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:39,200
because it's parody. Lady bunny and her collection of wigs. So my point is I, I, from the start,

1712
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:44,720
I was looking at this going, I mean, with all respect and maybe, maybe it is a respect thing.

1713
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:51,600
Maybe Capcom did go to, but they don't have to at the end of the day. Um, so that, that from the

1714
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:57,920
start was a little bit like was what's going on with this. I don't know. So anyway, um,

1715
02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:04,880
uh, so sorry, I'm re I'm reading the, the Weird Al discourse and chat, but it's, it's interesting.

1716
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:09,680
Um, Eminem was okay with the song, but not the music videos as Bobby Black Wolf. I didn't know

1717
02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:15,680
about that one. That's interesting. And Bobby Black Wolf said, Coolio never said yes. His

1718
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:21,280
people said yes. It was the opposite Gaga issue. The people made, well, the same issue. The people

1719
02:44:21,280 --> 02:44:27,280
made the decision without consulting the artists. But anyway, I digress. My point is I asking Bruce

1720
02:44:27,280 --> 02:44:31,120
Lee is a nice thing to do, but they didn't have, they don't have to do it. Nobody needs permission

1721
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:38,160
to parody, uh, Bruce Lee because he's not Bruce Lee. He's Faye Long. So there's that too. But

1722
02:44:38,160 --> 02:44:43,520
anyway, and also it never happened. Yeah. And yeah. And also it never happened. So by the way,

1723
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:47,760
Shannon Lee, who is Bruce Lee's daughter came out on the official Bruce Lee account to say,

1724
02:44:48,320 --> 02:44:55,360
we never made any comments of this nature. We have no idea who at Daniel Lindholm and I may,

1725
02:44:55,360 --> 02:45:01,920
I majorly respect the outright tagging. Like I'm not going to, I'm not going to snitch tag.

1726
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:07,360
I'm going to tag you. So you see it. We have no idea who this guy says his close friends

1727
02:45:07,360 --> 02:45:12,800
of the family are, but his comments are entirely false surrounding the Bruce Lee family. And I

1728
02:45:12,800 --> 02:45:18,080
think our, our person in question here, Daniel Lindholm, you know, who's now blaming the podcasts

1729
02:45:18,080 --> 02:45:24,480
and the, the, the YouTube media and all that and Twitter for just running with this. It's like,

1730
02:45:24,480 --> 02:45:30,000
no, dude, you said it. I mean, did you think it was a news story when you said it? No,

1731
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:35,040
but did you go on YouTube saying, Hey, I worked on street fighter. Ask me anything.

1732
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:39,200
Thinking that nobody was gonna, if you said something of this nature that like Faye Long's

1733
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:42,480
never going to be in it again, what you should, here's what you should have said.

1734
02:45:43,440 --> 02:45:47,040
A character that I know we won't see at all. There's been a lot of discussion about it.

1735
02:45:47,040 --> 02:45:50,640
I mentioned earlier, a character I would like to rewrite the music for would be fair.

1736
02:45:50,640 --> 02:45:53,840
Faye Long. Actually, he wouldn't have said, we won't see it all. He should have said a character

1737
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:58,880
I would really like rewrite the music for would be Faye Long. Just like all of you. I really hope

1738
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:03,600
we see him again soon. I wonder if there's reasons why we haven't seen him. I hope they're able to

1739
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:10,160
work it out. Even that you honestly don't even need the second half. Just say, I'd like to do

1740
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:16,080
Faye Long's music. Yeah. And that's it like, and tell us what you'd like about Faye Long's music

1741
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:22,000
or what you would do, what your interpretation would be. That's it. What he should have said,

1742
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:27,600
honestly, is like, it's been a Faye Long since we've seen, Faye Long time since we've seen him.

1743
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:32,160
I wish we'd see him back in the game again. You need to throw in the pun. Always the pun.

1744
02:46:34,560 --> 02:46:39,280
Good night, everyone. And thanks for listening to OLR. Shoshana says, here's the thing.

1745
02:46:39,280 --> 02:46:43,280
You can say what you want. But remember, when you speak about the company, you're a contractor or

1746
02:46:43,280 --> 02:46:47,920
just a regular employee. You're still speaking for the company. Your words carry weight, represent

1747
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:52,480
the company, and your words can damage the company. Don't be surprised if that company

1748
02:46:52,480 --> 02:46:57,520
doesn't invite you back if you try to speak for them. So on behalf of VOG Network, I would like

1749
02:46:57,520 --> 02:47:05,360
to say, fuck raisins. Raisins are terrible. California raisins ever done to you?

1750
02:47:06,800 --> 02:47:12,640
They taste bad. All right. I'm totally kidding. If people don't see the joke in that,

1751
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:19,520
I don't know what to tell you. All right. Anyhow. All right. So yes, be careful if you're going to

1752
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:24,080
do an Ask Me Anything about a video game. Don't get gotcha'd, and don't try to do this whole,

1753
02:47:24,080 --> 02:47:28,640
like, I have a friend of a friend, because it's so obvious. Something got lost in translation.

1754
02:47:28,640 --> 02:47:32,240
Dude, somebody told you they were a close friend of the Bruce Lee family

1755
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:37,520
when they were nothing like that. They were nothing of the sort. They ran into them at

1756
02:47:37,520 --> 02:47:41,200
a convention once or something and asked an offhanded question that they filled in the

1757
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:45,280
blanks to. Yeah, exactly right. E3VL, playing telephone.

1758
02:47:46,080 --> 02:47:50,560
My uncle is Bruce Lee, and he works at Nintendo, and he said that he's not going to be in

1759
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:52,960
Street Fighter anymore. Yes.

1760
02:47:52,960 --> 02:47:58,720
I'm reminded of a quote of yours, Loki. That, Al, I shot myself in the foot. How did that happen?

1761
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:06,160
All right. Let's get to the listener roundtable. We invite your chat comments with further

1762
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:12,800
questions, your calls on Discord, and any emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com if there's

1763
02:48:12,800 --> 02:48:17,280
any emails. This may be a quick segment tonight. Oh, no, we do have people in the green room.

1764
02:48:17,280 --> 02:48:20,240
All right. Let's try to get quickly to some of these calls.

1765
02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:21,440
Well, we don't have any emails.

1766
02:48:21,440 --> 02:48:26,400
Okay. So let's do some quick calls. I'm going to get to it. Let's bring some folks here

1767
02:48:26,400 --> 02:48:29,440
live on the air. Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1768
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:32,000
Zaku. Oh, my God.

1769
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:33,920
Zaku. I haven't heard from you in forever.

1770
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:34,320
Crap.

1771
02:48:35,280 --> 02:48:36,880
Yeah, it's been forever.

1772
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:39,200
Have you come to serenade us with your dulcet tones?

1773
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:50,160
Maybe. I am just finally able to do this on a regular ship. Sorry.

1774
02:48:50,160 --> 02:48:53,760
No, it's all good. It's good to hear from you. We're a little pressed for time tonight,

1775
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:55,840
so I don't want to be rude or anything. It is great to hear.

1776
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:56,720
No, of course.

1777
02:48:56,720 --> 02:49:02,240
First, I have to ask, Microsoft Flight Simulator, how awesome is that game? Because I know you're a

1778
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:04,080
flight sim guy. How awesome is Microsoft?

1779
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:12,640
I've tried it once. And yeah, it's pretty it's it is pretty awesome. But ever since

1780
02:49:13,760 --> 02:49:17,840
within the past few months, I've just upgraded hardware. So new video card motherboard,

1781
02:49:17,840 --> 02:49:23,200
the whole bang. And so now I'm in the process of just, you know, it's like moving into a new

1782
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:28,720
house. It's like you have to set yourself up again with every had. And so I have to start.

1783
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:35,600
I have to set up my flight simulator again. Mostly I've been doing a lot more DCS world,

1784
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:41,680
which is like combat flight. So it took me like, so it took me like, God knows how many hours,

1785
02:49:41,680 --> 02:49:47,360
I'd say like four or five hours just to set up BF 18 key bindings and settings of VR.

1786
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:48,400
All right.

1787
02:49:48,400 --> 02:49:55,120
Even on like a 3070 is just a lot of tweaking just to make sure the frames didn't drop. And I,

1788
02:49:55,120 --> 02:50:01,200
you know, be like smooth on VR. I just got a text from the spouse that says pizza and 10

1789
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:05,120
wrap it up. So I have to get to your. Yeah, that's pretty much it. It's just

1790
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:12,960
nothing much. I guess going back to conventions now, I went to PAX East almost a month ago,

1791
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:17,600
almost got COVID. Thankfully, it all turned out negative. But, you know,

1792
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:22,160
people were wearing their masks and following the guidelines.

1793
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:27,040
Yes, there were a lot of mask wearing. You couldn't even eat anywhere you wanted to.

1794
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:32,960
You had to eat in designated areas. But I guess like, people are saying like,

1795
02:50:32,960 --> 02:50:36,800
you know, there was a story about one of the pax enforcers who basically,

1796
02:50:36,800 --> 02:50:41,920
yeah, quote unquote, died of COVID. But based on what the what they're saying,

1797
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:48,000
what I heard about that case, it doesn't, you know, unless they like, unless they examined

1798
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:53,040
through autopsy, like what actually happened, it's really hard to speculate that someone died

1799
02:50:53,040 --> 02:51:00,720
of COVID. Maybe COVID was there and it was another contributing factor. But yeah, like,

1800
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:04,480
it could be something else like this person also had like, comorbidity.

1801
02:51:04,480 --> 02:51:08,400
Well, I don't I don't like you know what, it's it's really tragic what happened. And I don't

1802
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:14,400
want to speculate further, like, I don't want to speculate. And that's why, you know, people are

1803
02:51:14,400 --> 02:51:20,480
jumping to the conclusion that, you know, because a pax enforcer died of COVID that

1804
02:51:20,480 --> 02:51:25,120
maybe they should rethink the whole notion of having conventions entirely the problem because

1805
02:51:25,120 --> 02:51:29,280
now they can be done virtually. The problem is you can get COVID going to the grocery store,

1806
02:51:29,280 --> 02:51:34,720
you can get COVID going to the riding the bus, you can get COVID at your workplace, like it's,

1807
02:51:34,720 --> 02:51:39,200
it's, it's this weird thing where society has just decided COVID is over, but COVID

1808
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:44,880
hasn't decided it's over. So I don't know, I don't know what the answer is. You have to,

1809
02:51:44,880 --> 02:51:49,360
you have to look out for yourself right now. And I kind of wish I could get another shot, but

1810
02:51:49,360 --> 02:51:55,200
whatever it is what it is. But Zaku, what did you get to play anything at PAX East? Like,

1811
02:51:55,200 --> 02:52:01,280
is there any games we should be looking for? That Ninja Turtles one, that was that retro,

1812
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:07,840
that retro one. Otherwise, God, it's been it's been like weeks ago, but mostly like,

1813
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:17,760
uh, I mean, this PAX feels felt different, because it felt more, more, more open. Well,

1814
02:52:18,320 --> 02:52:24,560
and like less dense than than previous years. Let's just say that makes sense, though. Yeah,

1815
02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:29,200
no, of course. It's like the first PAX in like two years. So well, it's kind of trying to get back,

1816
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:33,040
it's probably laid out a little different, you know, kind of like Dark Soccer. Yeah,

1817
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:36,560
with the pinball thing. And that's, yeah, it's not only that, it's like,

1818
02:52:37,520 --> 02:52:42,000
there's like whole sections where there would have otherwise been other rows of vendors

1819
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:47,680
that were just like blank. And, you know, that helps with the spacing and whatnot. But

1820
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:53,200
it felt different, because, you know, not many vendors of the past were there. And so,

1821
02:52:53,840 --> 02:53:00,000
you know, I, I guess it's due to the fact that people are slowly going back to conventions.

1822
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:05,520
I know myself, the next one for me will be Otacon in the summer. But, you know, as it

1823
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:14,640
stands right now, it's, it's hard. It's basically the whole, the whole pandemic was a shock to

1824
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:21,200
anyone who, who did conventions on an annual basis. And so pick, it's basically like getting

1825
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:25,680
punched in the gut, and then you're, you're writhing in pain on the floor, trying to catch

1826
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:29,760
your breath. And then two years later, you get you pick yourself back up again and try

1827
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:36,080
knowing to watch out for getting punched again, which in this case, COVID.

1828
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:41,120
Well, Zaku, I hate to end on a negative note, but I have to for time. It's so good to hear

1829
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:43,600
from you though. I'm glad you're doing well. And thanks for being here tonight.

1830
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:47,520
All right. Yep. All right. Have a good one. All right. Bye-bye.

1831
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:50,960
Bye. All right. Let's sneak in one more call here. Cause I see someone else waiting in the

1832
02:53:50,960 --> 02:53:57,200
green room. Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hey, it is the one and only it is

1833
02:53:57,200 --> 02:54:02,080
Ron. It's so good to hear from you as always, but you know, I have to make it quick. I'm sorry.

1834
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:07,920
What's on your mind, buddy. All right. I'm going to make this quick as you want, but for the next

1835
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:13,360
couple of minutes, I'm going to take y'all back. I'm taking the show back to the roots of OLR.

1836
02:54:13,360 --> 02:54:20,320
I'm talking B money and DDR because they just opened up a brand new Dave and busters in my

1837
02:54:20,320 --> 02:54:27,200
neighborhood, in my town. So me and a friend, we decided to go and play and see if we still

1838
02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:32,480
had the right stuff. Okay.

1839
02:54:38,320 --> 02:54:45,840
Getting old sucks, doesn't it? No, I fell off the dance pad. I rolled to the side and I was

1840
02:54:45,840 --> 02:54:54,000
just laughing for 30 seconds straight. At least you had fun. You didn't actually

1841
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:57,440
hurt yourself. It sounds like you're good enough to call in and all that.

1842
02:54:58,640 --> 02:55:03,600
At least you didn't break your toe kicking the wall. I didn't want to say that, but yeah.

1843
02:55:04,720 --> 02:55:10,720
But it was, it was more like, you know, I played DDR at a con about a couple of months back,

1844
02:55:10,720 --> 02:55:15,120
you know, and when I got off the machine, I was like, Oh, I'm getting too old for this.

1845
02:55:16,720 --> 02:55:20,960
But me and my friend, we decided to play it. I'm like, you know what?

1846
02:55:20,960 --> 02:55:25,680
I'm going to put myself through these paces and see if I still got it. And we were mostly doing

1847
02:55:25,680 --> 02:55:32,160
stuff from fifth mix and we did three games and we were taking turns with other people.

1848
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:37,920
I do not remember all of the songs that we did, but for the very last song, she says,

1849
02:55:37,920 --> 02:55:41,920
we're going to push ourselves. And I'm like, what do you mean push ourselves?

1850
02:55:41,920 --> 02:55:45,840
She pulls up max 300. I'm just looking at, I'm like,

1851
02:55:46,720 --> 02:55:52,800
I never did max 300, except once I was like, get 911 on standby.

1852
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:59,280
You know what? They need to make a version of DDR called bitch. I'm 40. And it's just DDR. Oh,

1853
02:55:59,280 --> 02:56:04,640
ha star the kids version for back in the day. And it's DDR bitch. I'm 40. Oh, that and the spice

1854
02:56:05,440 --> 02:56:14,400
girls. I agree. I'm like, we need to have DDR for the grown folks. That's what we need.

1855
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:19,520
Beginner mode, my friend. Revolution. That's what we need.

1856
02:56:19,520 --> 02:56:21,920
Grandma. I'm so sorry. I have to let you go. So we wrap the show,

1857
02:56:21,920 --> 02:56:26,720
but any other quick thoughts for us tonight? I was acknowledged by George Takei at the Japan

1858
02:56:26,720 --> 02:56:33,440
day parade. I saw that is I, I, you know, I try not to get into the whole celebrity culture thing,

1859
02:56:33,440 --> 02:56:40,160
but God, it feels nice. Sometimes it really does. It was, I made my day. What can I say?

1860
02:56:40,160 --> 02:56:47,440
Sally O'Malley, DDR edition. Y'all are wait till OLR's 30th. Rama, my friend,

1861
02:56:47,440 --> 02:56:50,960
great to hear from you as always take care. And my jam session. Listen to it. Bye everyone.

1862
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:52,880
Bye. All right. Bye.

1863
02:56:53,760 --> 02:57:00,000
Why did I say bye? I don't know. All right. I meant to say, say bye everyone. Okay. Yeah.

1864
02:57:00,640 --> 02:57:04,640
It's about time for it. I can't find the right button. There it is. Okay.

1865
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:08,480
We're going to wrap up. We got to wrap up. Thank you so much for being here tonight and listening

1866
02:57:08,480 --> 02:57:11,680
to orange on radio. If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the

1867
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:15,200
show. Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more

1868
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:20,800
voices to put out on air. So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or whatever you

1869
02:57:20,800 --> 02:57:25,600
use to listen to this podcast, Google play Spotify. I don't know. I really appreciate

1870
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:30,640
it. Really appreciate that. I did see that. Bobby, Bobby is 29 again, a very happy birthday

1871
02:57:30,640 --> 02:57:35,360
to Bobby black Wolf, a little belated. I forgot to embarrass him on his show because we got onto

1872
02:57:35,360 --> 02:57:40,800
another topic and I have the memory of a turtle. So, um, happy belated Bobby black Wolf. And I

1873
02:57:40,800 --> 02:57:46,640
hope everything went well and I'll see you dragon con a few months. Um, that's it. Let's go around

1874
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:49,440
and give everybody's final thoughts. Uh, dark soccer, your final thoughts tonight.

1875
02:57:50,880 --> 02:57:55,280
The survivors aren't being salty little bitches tonight. I drink their tears like for, uh,

1876
02:57:55,280 --> 02:58:00,240
in my coffee. All right. Have a good stream. Thank you. Take care. I'm popping out now.

1877
02:58:00,240 --> 02:58:02,960
All right. Yep. Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

1878
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:07,120
Uh, my final thought is I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.

1879
02:58:09,360 --> 02:58:13,680
My final thought is why is like, I know there's supply chain issues or whatever,

1880
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:17,680
but why is everyone out of everything? Starbucks was out of sugar-free syrup,

1881
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:21,360
which they only carry one flavor of sugar-free syrup now, which is the whole issue in itself.

1882
02:58:21,920 --> 02:58:29,120
And Chipotle was out of rice today. That's just the world. The world is ending. All right.

1883
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:33,520
But in all seriousness, I hope to see you again in seven days for another episode of

1884
02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:37,440
