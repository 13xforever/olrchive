0	29000	I usually avoid the big headline in these opening reads, but sometimes it is THE issue and I want to say it out loud as well. Please help support those in need by whatever means you're able. Tonight we're covering a bundle supporting a memorial fund for Uvalde victims. Many can give blood, plasma, etc. and plenty of other media outlets have their suggestions available as well.
29000	36000	It's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to provide further information on this and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
59000	77000	Welcome to episode 916 of our show for tonight, May the 29th of 2022. It's Memorial Day weekend. It's a long weekend. But we're still here. I'm here. Rob Roberts and I am joined by as always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hi, DarkSakura. How are you?
78000	83000	I'm tired. Yeah, I moved a shelf and probably shouldn't have.
84000	104000	Uh, yeah, that that happened to me a couple weeks ago, because an electrician came by because you know, we're in a new house, and something was going on with one of the circuits. And he was like, I can't move that. So I had to move this big old shelving. It's it's the one that you you brought over the shelving thing. It's big, but I had to move it by myself. So the guy could move back there.
104000	105000	It's not that heavy.
105000	110000	It's heavy enough for one person. So I still hurt my back.
110000	112000	Ryan and I moved it out. So.
112000	115000	That's two people. I had one person.
115000	125000	Yeah, but I also have moved one of those around by myself. A bigger one. And okay.
125000	129000	Let's say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
129000	130000	Hello.
130000	131000	Hi, Loki. How are you doing?
131000	133000	I'm doing good.
133000	138000	Good. What is this game behind you tonight? This? I've never seen this.
138000	150000	I was searching for another long play video to play and I saw that they had one for Little Britain. I didn't realize there was a Little Britain game. But now there is and you can experience it.
150000	151000	Wow.
151000	152000	Me neither. There.
152000	156000	I'm assuming it was one of those shovelware titles on the Wii.
156000	159000	PlayStation two. It was way before the Wii.
159000	160000	All right.
160000	166000	And apparently it was trying to Yeah, I remember actually when this came out.
166000	174000	I was watching Little Britain. Oh, yeah, I remember the show is the fact they made a game marketing all kinds of stuff on in the UK. Wow.
174000	181000	All right. And here I thought the British invasion on consoles was done with Spice World on the PlayStation one.
181000	188000	But this is Spice World is I unironically a good game. This Oh, come on. There's also Wallace and Gromit.
188000	196000	Oh, yeah, I guess that's true. No, I'm sure there's plenty of others. I'm just and there was the Monty Python's complete waste of time. Oh, sure. Sure.
196000	204000	All right. There's there's there's some other stuff. I guess we got to get there's also supposed to be a Doctor Who game on the nest that never made out a prototype.
204000	209000	Really? I didn't know that. That's cool. Yeah, I went looking for the ROM dump up at last night, but I haven't had any luck.
209000	214000	Well, there's some fun ROM dumps that came out this week, but we'll get to that later in the show.
214000	221000	For now, we're going to start off tonight's show. A bit of difficult news because it ties into things that are going on in the real world.
221000	229000	Obviously, all of the news that came out of Texas with the school shooting is is horrific and horrible.
229000	235000	And I could probably spend a whole three hours. I'm going off on that. I'm not going to though.
235000	241000	There's a bundle that's coming out to try to help folks to try to do something to raise money.
241000	247000	If I remember right, it's a charity for the school that was impacted and trying to get some of the folks there.
247000	255000	Some some mental health treatment and maybe pay for some things that might be a little harder to come by otherwise.
255000	267000	So it's an itch.io bundle and it's for the it's called the bundle for Valde and it's got a variety of NES ROM games in it.
267000	274000	But I think we all know why the reason why I'm bringing it up on this show. Loki, is there anything you would care to say about this bundle?
274000	285000	Yes. So this bundle was one that Nate Peters, who also does NES dev stuff, he has a game doodle world.
285000	288000	Chocolates should be coming out on the switch here pretty soon.
288000	303000	So he put it together where it's a bunch of just basically trying to get any itch.io creators to come together to put together a bundle of games for the of all the the Rob School Memorial Fund.
303000	310000	So it's got my game Pixel Hoops number two in there. There's lots of other NES games in there as well.
310000	314000	So if you're a fan of the NES, there's tons and tons of homebrew games.
314000	324000	So we have like Doodle World, Shira and the 40 Thieves, Nix the Paradox Relic, Turtle Paint, which is kind of fun as a little Mario Paint game.
324000	330000	Lots and lots of NES games in there. So there's actually a total of like 34 items in there.
330000	335000	I think most of these are games. There's also I think some other like asset packs and stuff in there.
335000	339000	Not your, you know, 1000 game bundles that you had for like, you know, some of the other things.
339000	348000	But it's still it's nice. It's 10 bucks or, you know, anything else you want to donate to that and then you get everything.
348000	353000	So the price of my game, you get my game and lots of other games are probably better than mine.
353000	360000	Yeah, I mean, there you go. I'm not saying yes to that. But yes to the the quote unquote deal. It shouldn't be about the deal, but I get it.
360000	364000	The deal is what gets people's attention for the worthy cause.
364000	375000	And like you said, for the cost of your game, you can now pick up a lot of NES games and a lot of similar type of games of creators that went in there and made their own NES titles.
375000	382000	And as pointed out by you and other folks in chat, some other collections like asset titles, some tabletop RPGs and so forth.
382000	390000	And again, for an important cause that sucks that we have to have this cause, but we do people are trying to help.
390000	397000	So this is this is good. And I know I know you were trying to get in a previous charity bundle and you were kind of wondering, like, how do I get in on one of these bundles?
397000	403000	But here you go. You got it on one. So yep. So I went through that process. It's pretty easy.
403000	407000	Awesome. Well, congratulations on that. And how long does that bundle run for?
407000	412000	It's running for the week, so it's going to be ending in about six days. So I think the end of this week.
412000	426000	Nice. Going to our chat room because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG network twitch.tv slash VOG network VOG network and you can find us there.
426000	435000	We have our live chat room who makes comments such as Bobby Black Wolf, ironically says just picked it up for $25. Excellent. Excellent. I haven't picked it up yet, but I will.
435000	442000	I want to help you all reach your goal, which I'm sure you'll have no problem reaching as word about this gets out. So that's that's awesome.
442000	450000	And dark Titsiya saying I heard Loki was trying to get his game in there. Yeah, well, if you follow Loki on Twitter, you sometimes get some insight.
451000	461000	Definitely signal boosted that one on Twitter and just picked it up myself. Awesome. And I hope us mentioning it on the show brings a little more awareness and maybe a few more people will pick it up. That would be awesome.
461000	475000	Hopefully. Yeah. Before we get into our headline tonight, dark Sakura, I know you'd been texting me the other day about another charity effort going on that you wanted to bring attention to and I figured now as good of a time as any.
475000	489000	I mean, it's going to be over at 10 o'clock today, but there's fundraisers actually ongoing for one of people in our general Dead by Daylight and other streaming games community on Twitch.
489000	517000	I'm a pansexual pirate has a heart condition and isn't in the best shape. So, money is being raised for medical treatment and or post costs that might come about really really just fun personal around and I hate that, that they're going through this, but I have a link for those in chat to a
517000	531000	post that shows where donations and contacts can be made if you go on Twitter, it's TTV pan PIR number eight.
531000	533000	And you can get more information there.
533000	544000	So yeah, even maybe after tonight, I'm sure there'll still be a way to contribute to that. For those that don't hear this until Monday or Tuesday so if you're feeling so generous and can help somebody out.
544000	560000	I know dark soccer the, you have increased your participation in the Twitch community 10 fold over the past year, year and a half, you know, with your own, you know channel and streaming and so forth and just again I know I've joked about this on a private previous
560000	565000	I can't go into a dead by daylight streamers channel and not run into you.
565000	583000	But I specifically lately you can't go into Nick's channel. Yeah, but it's just because you and I just both like I you consider Nick a friend I consider Nick a friend like we've met him we've hung out with the same people exactly so it's like one of those like you know, yeah, of course we're gonna run into each other there so but that's not the only one.
583000	600000	But my point is is just you know to kind of show in a lighthearted way that like you know you do and you do become friends with the streamers you do make room in your heart for them you do you know start to get to know them very well and so when somebody's going through something very difficult.
600000	604000	Yeah, you want to do whatever you can to help so I get it.
604000	633000	Mike Defton chat says that's me and Pokemon streams and yeah it might be it might be related to a specific game it also might not be it might be just you know a particular personality that you enjoy or what have you so yeah it's it's very interesting how Twitch has really impacted gaming culture, specifically since the pandemic started really I mean I know Twitch was already pretty big before then but I really think the pandemic just
633000	642000	accelerated it even more if you know what I mean and really like that was just even more so the way we saw people many times. So, yeah.
642000	656000	All right, let's move on to our kickoff topic headline for tonight which has to do with a pretty big significant move in the industry for a triple A studio so this isn't the first time this has happened.
656000	661000	It's the first time it's happened at triple A studio, Loki you want to get into what happened this week.
661000	679000	Yeah, so basically, it's the least evil thing they could do so. Phil Spencer said that Microsoft will recognize the Raven software union. Once the deal, the acquisition deal of Activision closes.
679000	685000	So they're going to actually recognize them basically say hey listen once we acquire them.
685000	701000	We're not, I don't know like Activision actively trying to stop the union exactly that's well, and it's important to say Monday was the day that Raven voted for the union to have right so that's you know that's the first bit of it is that I, I don't have the vote
701000	707000	in front of me it was something like 26 to three or something like that I may have gotten that wrong sorry I just don't have the numbers in front of me.
707000	714000	But it was it was pretty overwhelming you had a few people that voted no but the vast majority voted yes.
714000	728000	Even in light of Activision's attempt to kind of union bust in their own way I think I think they kind of had to scale it back once the general public has been paying attention to everything that they do.
728000	738000	But there's definitely documented emails and efforts and things that happened right around the time, you know, they were first in the news for for all the reasons.
738000	749000	You know, we've been talking about them lately to with some open union busting and you know hiring people that work there that that have been known for working with union busting organizations.
749000	767000	Those efforts failed with Raven having unionized this week. And so I think it's a little bit significant for Phil Spencer Microsoft to come in and say, you know, even though Activision was is was engaging in the process of union busting Raven or Microsoft will acknowledge Ravens union.
767000	770000	Yeah, because they certainly won't be the last.
770000	781000	Right, and they basically he will Phil Spencer basically said that Linda Norman and I have been spending a lot of time educating myself on unions we absolutely support employees right to organize and form unions.
781000	786000	Once the deal closes we'd absolutely support employees organization in the place.
786000	793000	We think it's a right of employees and something that can be a part of the relationship between a company and people who work at the company.
793000	797000	So, doesn't sound like they're gonna stand their way.
797000	800000	Hopefully their actions. Follow that right.
800000	816000	It's interesting to to hear Phil Spencer say he has to educate himself on unions that kind of makes you stop and realize, oh, because Microsoft isn't and, and you know all these other studio how many studios did Microsoft swoop up in the last 10 years.
816000	833000	Double digits at least they haven't had to deal with this before so I would gather, Phil Spencer probably doesn't just have to educate himself on this for Ravens purposes, but probably for where other studios are going to go in the coming years, I think it's
833000	840000	going to be a wave that moves quicker rather than, you know, slowly. We'll see.
840000	847000	Yeah, but it also probably shows how much misinformation is spread around in the corporate world about unions anyway.
847000	862000	Oh well we know that there's many companies that will watch have you watch videos that is basically anti union stuff because Kotaku or one of their sister sites had that target training video from the early 90s because they actually the irony was that used
862000	879000	union actors, and they had a whole story about it and and that. So, yeah, but there's like there's a target video that went through that and you can watch it if you want to see for yourself like what the propaganda is Walmart absolutely has something similar
880000	906000	and so on and so on. You definitely also point out that this is not something unique to just the gaming industry. Starbucks, we've heard a lot of buzz about that lately. Granted, this is a video game podcast so we don't talk about those usually, but it's where you see a lot of industries headed right now not just the gaming industry, but I think we all know why the gaming industry needs it.
906000	929000	Right. Yeah, because what the conditions aren't great. Also, there was a comment from Reggie Fils-Aime, who was interviewed by believe the Washington Post basically saying, you know, he made a comment about I don't even know how it came up, but you know, I've worked in industries that have had high levels of unionization.
929000	950000	This is not a bad or good thing. It is a situation as leader, as an executive that you need to manage to just like any other challenge or issue or opportunity you face. So, I mean, I don't know. Cool. He thinks that yeah, I'm not really like at a game company right now. So it's like,
951000	979840	yeah, Reggie isn't at a game company anymore. So it doesn't really, it sounds harsh. It doesn't really matter what he thinks. However, I still think he holds a lot of influence in this industry. I think he knows it too. So, you know, as he's going on this book tour, I think I think people listen to what he has to say just from his insight, having been at Nintendo and of course, Nintendo has been in the spotlight recently as well. They have we've heard a lot of, especially when it comes to the
979840	1009820	contractors. We've had a lot of talk about that. So, you know, they they've been in the spotlight as well. I do find that interesting that Reggie does have that perspective. And we have to remember he wasn't always at Nintendo. He came from I know he had been at Panda Express for a while vh one wasn't it or something like that. So certainly in the the vh one television industry, you had all sorts of unions, right? You you deal with Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild, the all of it, dealing with that.
1009840	1035480	So yeah, he probably did have that experience. So Dr. See, it says I think Little Caesars as well. And I, I don't know the man's entire resume, but I do know Nintendo was the first gaming company he was at, as far as I remember. So yeah, that's just interesting. So we'll see. Do you think Do you think more companies are set to unionize in the near future? Do you think we're gonna have another AAA studio by the end of the year? We'll say?
1036480	1037200	Probably.
1037200	1066200	Yeah, I think so. I think what we're hearing from Phil Spencer, I think we'll probably mobilize another Microsoft Studio. And I think I think Activision Blizzard, I think Activision Blizzard itself will end up here in a matter of time. So we'll see. All right. Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks in a segment we call how is your gaming week? So dark Sakura, we'll start with you. How is your gaming week?
1067200	1096200	I've played some Dead by Daylight. I played Terran, Terranigma. I've played some of that word game that I play to it's just been kind of, especially after having the big pinball thing, I've just sort of been like, I kind of don't feel like playing anything. So just my usual, then, of course, I had my COVID booster, my second one on Tuesday. And I've been really freakin tired. So it's sort of like, do I really want to go?
1097200	1109200	Do I want to deal with all of this? No. But I played a little bit here and there. Although I did have to have to cancel my stream on on Thursday for just being way too pooped.
1109200	1114200	But yeah, the booster will knock you out sometimes just dependent. It was depends on the person.
1114200	1118200	I was surprised that Saturday I still felt like crap. But yeah, better now.
1118200	1122200	Yeah. All right. Well, we'll go over to Loki. How was your gaming week?
1122200	1133200	It's just Minecraft. It's just getting ready for things to come. I guess, you know, starting another S&P pretty soon. So just getting all prepared for that.
1134200	1136200	I saw you put out another video, though. Plug, plug.
1136200	1142200	Put out another video. Yeah. Yeah. So like still trying to get it down to weekly stuff. I need to.
1142200	1152200	I have more of my hardcore series. I got a film and then I've got to put out a tutorial for a copper farm that I put together.
1152200	1158200	So because I've been promising to do that and been putting it off. So I need to do that as well.
1159200	1170200	So Leo, I'm very busy. I also need to finish the hardcore series, hopefully around the time because the new update for Minecraft, the one 18 updates on the seventh. So it's right around.
1170200	1174200	And what are they what are they adding in that for those of us not as in the loop?
1174200	1194200	So it's called the wild update. It's basically they've got a couple new biomes in there. So the big one is, of course, the deep dark in the ancient cities are in there and they have a new kind of it's not really a boss monster, but it's like a pretty tough monster to go up against, which is the warden.
1194200	1207200	And so they have that. They're also adding mangrove swamps. So they're kind of redoing the swamps a little bit to make them more interesting because swamps are really terrible before. And frogs, frogs are in there now. So that's kind of cool.
1207200	1213200	They poop out lights because that's what frogs do. They make lights with their butt.
1214200	1216200	According, I learned something today.
1218200	1220200	All right. World to live in.
1221200	1222200	What a world.
1223200	1224200	My gaming week.
1224200	1232200	I have been a little busy I hosted another show last night was really good so can't can't complain about spending the hours on that.
1232200	1248200	But it's a very typical Rob gaming week played some Final Fantasy 14, of course, doing then doing the new raid with that there's a 24 man raid that I've been doing with my friends and then the eight man raid the last one you kind of do it every week for a token
1248200	1262200	upgrade your weapons. So I've been working on that as well. Otherwise still working on my Reaper leveling that class, which was one of the new classes they brought out with Endwalker. My Reaper just hit 81 so I can start doing the new dungeons like Tower of Zat and stuff like that.
1262200	1270200	It's so fun to refer to Tower of Zat and Tower of Babel as like new dungeons when they are influenced by Final Fantasy four. So it's kind of fun.
1271200	1284200	Otherwise, also, I've been playing No Man's Sky. Not a big shock because you know, I really enjoy that game. However, and I'm sorry, Loki, because I know you have a headline on this later, but I'll just kind of briefly say they added a new expedition into the game.
1284200	1298200	So I've been playing that. And I was streaming it a little bit a couple of nights anyway. And the interesting thing about it is that it's kind of a roguelike. So it encourages you to die and start the loop over.
1298200	1312200	So when I did the first night stream was about two and a half hours, and I died right at the beginning because you're supposed to it's actually one of the achievements is dying. But then I died probably about two and a half hours into it because there was a nasty surprise.
1312200	1324200	I'm just gonna spoiler alert, but you'll thank me later. There is a nasty surprise at the end of the first part of the excellent when you're doing the first phase, you get to a part where you have to activate what looks like a gravestone.
1324200	1341200	It's one of the little Atlas looking things you activate it. What I was not prepared for were that the scorpion aliens that also show up when you steal eggs showed up to kick my ass and that's how I died. But like any good roguelike, you learn from what you did the first time.
1341200	1370200	And the second time, I got through it in an hour and 40 minutes and I knew what to expect. So they didn't kill me the second time. Haha. So I got a little further on my second stream that I did on Friday night. I don't know what his time anymore. So I got a little further and but I wrapped it up there because it was starting to get late. So oh yeah, and then the game bugged out on me, which it's not no man's sky if it doesn't get buggy somewhere. But I went I went into a pirate outpost.
1370200	1391200	And it was all white. There was no color, every shape, every texture was just pure white. And I was like, did I go to heaven? Did I die? Like what happened? And I was like, you know what, this is a good time to quit. And so I did. But I'll stream that again, maybe tomorrow. I don't know what I'm doing for the holiday yet. So maybe a little bit tomorrow. We'll see when I feel like it.
1391200	1421040	I don't know when I feel like it. Um, also, though, I did play something new. So it wasn't just the same old stuff. I played something new, but it was old. And what I mean is I played Pac Man Museum Plus, because that just came out on Xbox Game Pass. So if you have Game Pass, you can just download it. Otherwise, I think it's on all the other, you know, platforms you'd expect it to be on. And I say it's new old because it is a collection of some older Pac Man games such as the original Pac Man, Super Pac
1421040	1440000	Man, Pac and Pal, which sucks. I'm just gonna be like Pac and Pal is probably the worst Pac Man game like it just it sucks. Pac Land, Pac Mania, but then it gets some it gets some more of the more recent titles in there to Pac Man 256, which is only about five years old is in there as well. Pac
1440000	1454960	Man Championship Edition is in there as well. Not in there, Ms. Pac Man. But there's right stuff going on. This is the game where they actually they like changed Ms. Pac Man and some of the other games to what was her name? Pac Mom? Pac Wife?
1454960	1456080	Oh, right.
1456080	1459080	Pac Mommy? Will you be my Pac Mommy?
1460080	1461520	He's a strong, independent woman.
1461520	1469320	Yeah. So yeah, I don't know who she is now. But she's she's she's not Ms. Pac Man. She's she's Pac Mistress.
1469320	1470640	She doesn't need to explain herself to anybody.
1470840	1481240	She doesn't. She doesn't need to. She doesn't need to introduce herself to anyone. She just and what is it? She doesn't have a bow in her hair. She has something else. A hat? I don't remember what it is.
1481240	1482040	A bee in her bonnet.
1482520	1483800	I don't remember now.
1484520	1489000	Does she have a bonnet? Is it does it contain bees? Some sort of insect?
1489040	1497480	Thank you, Orange Right. She has a hat. It's confirming she's instead of a bow, she has a hat. And it's Pac confirmed. It's Pac Mom. Hat confirmed. Mom confirmed.
1498600	1499720	Doc or Pac Mom?
1502880	1504240	Rock'em Sock'em Pac Mom?
1505240	1532120	So, see, all these games y'all are saying would be amazing if Pac Man would go there, but you know, we're not getting it. Instead, we get Pac in Time. Yes, we get that Pac Man Arrangement, which is actually kind of cool. The whole thing is encased in this inspired by Animal Crossing, I would guess museum, because you actually get to lay out the museum. And as you play the games, you get the little cabinets that you can place throughout the museum. As you get
1532120	1558640	achievements, your little ghost friends show up in the museum as well. There's a little gacha mechanic where you you know, you it's based off a real thing where you get the little figurines, and you can put the figurines in. So it very much has an Animal Crossing inspired element. It's not that deep. Like it's not Animal Crossing is not that deep. But it's cute. I at first I was sorry, your audio is not coming through for some reason, Doc Sacker. What?
1559080	1560920	I said ghost friends. I don't know her.
1561800	1590600	Exactly. Well, I'm used to getting ghosted. So why not have my ghost friends? But um, I the only thing that bugged me at first was I was like, this is such a pain in the ass to find the game I want to play. Like, because like all of the like Pac 256 and championship edition are over at the free game. And then you get coins in the free game to play. Okay, but I learned really quick. So pro tip if you're going to start Pac Man museum plus, if you just hit the
1590600	1620560	start button, you get a list of everything and you can just pick what you want to play. It's much easier. However, some things are still locked. So like I couldn't play Super Pac Man, underrated Pac Man in my opinion, until I played original Pac Man twice, which isn't that hard to do. Then I can play Super Pac Man. I couldn't play Pac and pal overrated Pac Man until I played Pac Land twice. So there are some weird little unlocks like that, but they're not particularly difficult.
1620640	1650040	So I guess it's just to try to get you to play a little bit of everything. So cute, I guess. Um, that was my gaming week. Dark Tetsuya says, Okay, that is kind of neat. I do miss the Namco museum atmosphere of just walking around to the really chill music and looking at the exhibits. Thank you, dark Tetsuya. Like honestly, has there been a Namco collection as good as that PlayStation one collection? I don't think so. I really don't. Um,
1650080	1679800	I would love I don't see this happening, but I'm gonna say it anyway, because it's a podcast. I would love for the entire n a m c o trademark, all of those games to be rereleased in one fucking massive arcade collection released on like PS four, five Xbox switch. I don't give a shit. Just something modern. I would love all of that. That would be so
1679800	1690840	cool. Dark Sakura, you're a Namco fan. I, I am quite confident you already own the entire Namco museum on PS one. But would you would you be into something like I'm suggesting?
1691880	1696840	Possibly, yeah. It would all depend on factors. Many factors.
1697560	1714680	Dark Tetsuya says I know there were a couple on PlayStation two that had a good chunk of those. That is true. And actually, how could I forget? I didn't forget. I'm gonna bring it up. But actually, the Namco collection they had on PlayStation three. While it didn't have as many games on it. I don't know if you all remember.
1715320	1741960	OLR has a cameo in that game. Somebody on the inside wink, wink, nudge nudge is a fan of OLR. And in the loading screen or something that one of the like tutorial screens will say, what is it you look at the high it says you can compete with your friends online. And it actually shows a high score table. And if you look at the high score table, it says like the initials are like OLR. And then it says like sky, which is the name I was on Twitter for a long time. Dark
1741960	1771680	Sakura, Loki, so like our names are in it. And then I think I think tingle is on there. Or no, it says tangle or something like like they changed the name slightly of tingle from from, you know, Zelda because they obviously can't use that. But it was something like adjacent. So if you didn't already know that extra name that was on it was supposed to be like tingle. Back to the old end joke of having Loki dress up in a tingle costume. Yeah, they did something like tinkle or something
1771680	1801040	where it was just slightly different, but it close enough. It was enough. Yeah, it was it was enough to make my little heart happy. And I will say, you know, we're coming up on 20 years OLR, right? Reminder June 26. If you kind of ask going back 20 years of OLR, like what is one of your like greatest achievements? I would say when we showed up in a game like that, even though it was something small, it was something subtle to me. And that's not the only one either. But
1801480	1811040	I'll let you find the others. Um, the fact that we showed up in a game like that, like just meant the world that was very much like a holy shit, like
1811080	1812880	that was the we kind of made it moment.
1812880	1830920	Yeah, that was like the we made it heavy. And you notice not even the podcast award, which was cool, too. Don't get me wrong. But like, that was the moment was like, Oh, shit. Now. Now we're in the game. Now we're in the game. That was the moment that really was. And then of course, and Bobby Blackwell says even yyr wouldn't put
1830920	1860560	me in his games. I thought there was supposed to be a villain named Blackwolf in one of the games. Maybe I made that up. But um, maybe it wasn't a different OLR dream game came in there. But that was that was certainly the other when yyr actually did bungee ferret tossing. But that came second, if I remember right, when yyr actually did bungee ferret tossing. And that was like a whole game available on the 360 at the time that was made out of an OLR in joke, that was like the same type of thing where it was like,
1861080	1890840	holy shit, like that was the moment that's it's meta. It's where the gaming podcast very became a game. Sorta. So I love it. So those are those are just some like, those are definitely like some highlights. So yeah, just always, always very thrilling. So all right. There was supposed to be another. I got to go to look that up. I don't know if I don't know if the game came out or what but anyway, I was I was alerted to keep my eyes
1890840	1911480	out and ears open. But that's all I'll say for now. All right. Before I get in trouble or get I don't want to get anyone else in trouble either for sure. Um, so any better, I better hear about this offline. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Um, all right. Let's get into some more news. However, a lot going on in the industry. Let's get to Loki.
1912320	1939840	Yes, it's like we get so many different things. Well, most of the stories we've heard about Netflix recently about what are they canceling. So it's nice to know what's something that's being worked on, I guess it's coming at some point. But horizon zero dawn apparently is going to be coming to Netflix as a series of some sort. So that's pretty cool. Obviously, I don't know if they have any sort of
1939840	1969720	timeline in mind for that. But um, yeah, that would be very interesting, I think, if they do it right. But I don't know, like a big F. Yeah, it would be hard to it's a good property to do it. But like, like, for example, you know, don't do a Paramount Plus did with Halo, you know, actually have people that are making the project, play the games and be familiar with the game.
1969840	1979680	And not just go, Well, I want to make my own thing in a sci fi world with dinosaur robots, you know, have someone somewhat competent. Put that together, please. Yeah.
1979680	2009680	Um, questmaster in chat says that twitch tv slash vog network says I can only hope they do it justice. Well, that's what any any gaming fan wants is they want their franchise to be done justice. Like, I don't know, like, when I look at the 90s Mortal Kombat movie, as much as people dislike that movie for various reasons, I sort of look at it and I go but it did the games justice. Like the the 90s games were cheesy, you know, and it gave it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did
2009680	2014400	do justice, I think, to the series. And I think that's why gamers kind of forgive that movie. And
2014400	2017680	I'm not talking about the newer Mortal Kombat, which I personally didn't see yet anyway, because
2017680	2023040	it came out at the height of the pandemic. And it was pretty good to was it I just didn't see it. But
2023040	2028720	yeah, it doesn't have that cheesy char as like the 90s one, but like, yeah, pretty good. Yeah. Um,
2028720	2033680	and then also, I'm thinking of Silent Hill. Like, you know, I think like Dark Soccer, I know, you
2033680	2037520	feel the same way I did where it's like, a lot of people didn't like the movie, but I thought it was
2037520	2044240	great. Like, especially the sequel. Yeah, well, I have not seen the sequel yet. The sequel is not
2044240	2050800	as warmly received. But you you, you probably cut it a lot more slack because it does justice for
2050800	2055360	you to the games. You know, it's based off of Silent Hill three. So that's why I like it.
2057280	2062960	Now, Funara is my favorite. Yeah. Funara in chat says hopefully by the same kind of people who did
2062960	2067200	the Witcher bit, even though they were pulling more from the books than the games. Yeah. I mean,
2067200	2071040	even though the Witcher Yeah, technically, it's based on the books. I think we all know
2071040	2077600	the games are hugely influential to the show, and so forth. And honestly, the Witcher and the games,
2077600	2082880	I think are why and the success of the TV show are why we're seeing now horizon Zero Dawn,
2082880	2086720	we know Final Fantasy 14 got picked up at some point, which I think was also by the
2086720	2091920	Witcher group, actually. So I'm, can I tell you how interesting the Final Fantasy 14 Oh,
2091920	2095600	God, if they do it right, if they actually give like each, I don't know if they're going to tell
2095680	2101040	the same story. But like if they actually give each expansion like its own season.
2102720	2109920	It's the shadow bringers and the end Walker seasons are going to be so good. I could cry.
2109920	2117040	Like I just I please like do it as long as they do it justice. That's for sure. Um, but um, yeah,
2117040	2122240	so there's, there's that. And then I think, we know Mass Effect got changed from the movie,
2122240	2126160	it was supposed to be 10 years ago or something to now it's going to be a series. And that's,
2126160	2130560	that's the whole thing too. So yeah, just all and now of course, Halo had a series for better for
2130560	2136320	worse. Yes. And just all this stuff is getting picked up for series now. So it's it's, it's
2136320	2144880	interesting how much video games is now impacting the TV world. So and then of course, anime, right?
2144880	2150160	So Castlevania, and the anime was very well received. And there's other games that are
2150160	2151680	going that route as well. So
2152400	2157840	even like I hear the Cuphead shows. All right. Oh, is I don't see I totally forgot that came
2157840	2163120	out. But yeah, that's kids. Well, my son watched the he binges the whole thing really fast. So
2163120	2169280	like, I don't know, he apparently enjoyed it. Yeah. I need to watch the new Stranger Things
2169280	2175120	that just came out just just in time for when I canceled Netflix. Well, there's that and then I
2175120	2180000	have to watch you know that I don't I'm not a huge fan of like Star Wars stuff. I need to watch
2180000	2186960	the new Obi Wan series. I watched a little bit of it with Dan and I'm sorry, Leah is sassy and
2186960	2192560	I love her. Little Leah is the best. Wait, they they have like a new layer.
2194000	2201600	Well, it's set like before her adulthood. Oh, okay, I get it. Like at right after order
2202000	2205040	Young Obi Wan like like just after like the
2206320	2209680	prequels middle age Obi Wan. Okay, I get it. Because I was like,
2209680	2214480	Carrie Fisher cannot be replaced. And I feel bad for whoever that actress is. But okay. Oh,
2215760	2219440	this kid does her justice. Okay, that's great to hear. That's great to hear. And yeah,
2219440	2223040	child is a different scenario. Yeah. So okay, that's neat.
2224160	2226320	Honestly, her attitude makes me think of
2226320	2234720	Okay, what was her name in in in chair of swords? That was the the little girl who led the north one
2234720	2238960	of the north is Aria Stark because is that Aria? I don't remember.
2242960	2243760	It was an L.
2245920	2250480	I know. I don't know. I don't know the dragon soap opera. I don't Yes, the wrong person.
2251520	2255760	It's a good show. She's a badass 10 year old. Okay. All right.
2256880	2262800	Fair enough. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm hopeful the horizon zero dawn show will not suck because
2262800	2268000	again, I didn't beat the the new game or the first game, but I enjoyed what I played in the first
2268000	2272000	game. I actually need to go back and beat it like it was good enough for me to go back and play
2272000	2276160	through at some point. But you know, there's just so many games to play and not enough time. It's
2276160	2281520	the eternal struggle, right? All right. Too many irons in the fire and not enough hammers.
2282400	2287520	A song of ice and fire. Is that it? No. All right. I'm thinking of the stupid show because
2287520	2293600	I started reading the books and hated them. Let's move on. Speaking of things that were hated by a
2293600	2299040	lot of people. Some nasty news was out earlier this week that had come out of Asia, where
2299040	2305360	PlayStation Plus the new version was going live, where some folks who gamed the system early on
2305360	2310320	basically stacking up their time that we're going to be converted to get the highest tier of
2310320	2317760	PlayStation now at a lower price. We're getting hit with an upgrade tax, dun dun dun. But it
2317760	2324080	actually came out and I will quickly add to the story that Sony came out and said, Oh, it was a
2324080	2331120	mistake. This pricing pricing fiasco was an error. In a tweet was the official asked PlayStation
2331120	2336320	account said due to a technical error, players in Asia who have previously purchased a PlayStation
2336320	2340880	Plus membership and a discount have been incorrectly charged for their upgrade pricing.
2340880	2345280	This error has been fixed and impacted players will receive a credit. We thank you for your
2345280	2350320	patience. Okay, I'm glad they fixed it. And that's the important thing at the end of the day.
2351360	2358880	You can't help but wonder, were they gonna find multiple people in chat put mistake in quotes,
2358880	2365200	you have to wonder, would they have been so quick to find that mistake? If social media and gaming
2365200	2370800	media had not pointed it out for them? multiple times? You have to wonder,
2371680	2379200	oh, our bad that we got caught. Oops. Now, some other news coming out of the launch of
2379200	2384480	PlayStation Plus in or the you know, the new PlayStation Plus in Asia is that the classic
2384480	2391600	games, some of them are the PAL versions, which you may recall was a lot of the shit that the
2391600	2399440	PlayStation classic got in trouble for. I should say they don't all use PAL regions. But some of
2399440	2405360	them do. So for example, ape escape was one that was noted, I think a I don't think the cloud
2405360	2410240	service had completely rolled out. But ape escape was somehow available. So a Twitter user actually
2410240	2416400	grabbed it and found, oh, it runs at the PAL frame rate, which is actually a lower frame rate. So
2416400	2423200	it's a 50 hertz frame rate instead of 60. Well, once again, because social media is so quick to
2423200	2430480	point this out, I believe Sony actually put out some type of patch to try to correct this. But it
2430480	2439040	made it worse. Because they're trying to force the 5060 frames a second through some sort of I don't
2439040	2444320	know, like, like, basically machine learning or whatever to put it out there. And it's not actually
2444400	2448800	just the PAL version. So I don't know why they just can't emulate the fucking PAL version. I
2448800	2454400	don't know what's holding them back. Some people were speculating is it because maybe the region
2454400	2461360	that this was released in is it defaulted to NTSC? I don't know. But it's an issue that should be
2461360	2469920	dealt with now. ape escape, hotshots golf, jumping flash, all were observed to be using PAL. But
2470640	2478240	Tekken two was NTSC. So and considering Tekken two is a fighting game. That's some good news.
2479280	2486000	But that is that is I don't know, it's just weird that this is happening. And that you would think
2486000	2493280	somebody Sony kind of realizes this is an issue, right? I don't know. I'm dark to see you didn't
2493280	2498640	really know. Yeah, didn't Nintendo give Europe the 60 hertz versions? Anyway, I'm pretty sure
2498640	2504000	because now that everything is high definition television, all of that stuff is out the window.
2504720	2511200	The reason why this was all an issue to begin with is because the old CRT televisions were different
2511200	2519040	between Europe and the US. And I believe Asia had the same type of TVs we had here in the US.
2519040	2520080	Yeah, they're NTSC.
2520080	2525680	Yeah. But the PAL TVs over in Europe. That's why whenever you see like an old episode of Doctor
2525680	2531440	Who, or if you ever watched old BBC stuff that they would play on PBS, it looked different,
2531440	2536080	like it kind of looked weird, right? That's because it was converted from PAL and PAL had
2536080	2541600	a different resolution as well. PAL was a slight wasn't like 20 pixels bigger. I remember right.
2543200	2544480	For refresh rate.
2544480	2549040	Yeah, it was just it was refresh rate. Yeah. So now Oh, yeah. And then there was C cam.
2549040	2555120	I forgot about C cam. That was in. Was that in other non Japan, Asia territories? I can't
2555120	2562320	remember where C cam was. It was somewhere else. But um, yeah, there was that third format. So
2563280	2568000	yeah, D'Arcy says I remember the whole policy cam thing back in the 90s. I read about it all the
2568000	2572880	time and mags back then. Yep. Zen monkey says I don't blame Sony for trying to take advantage of
2572880	2579680	an exploit. Gamers are ripping them off. So they tried to balance out. I think I think what was
2579680	2585840	pissing people off was that you were kind of forced into it. So like, Sony should have at
2585840	2590720	least given the I mean, obviously, they reverse course, but they should have like had the option
2590720	2595440	or they should have done something where it's like, hey, since you bought it at this lower rate,
2595440	2601520	it's converted to the amount that you actually bought from the real prices. I don't know. They
2601520	2605360	probably could have done that. And people would have been like, Oh, sucks, but they would have
2605360	2612880	dealt with it. You know, Pele Hanumea points out my Amiga monitor could handle PAL, but the bottom
2612880	2620240	of the PAL games were cut off. Yeah, the Commodore platforms in particular are interesting because
2620240	2625520	they were bigger in Europe than they were over here in the US. So a lot of it was kind of, you
2625520	2633360	know, focused to that. So just kind of interesting. A game I've been playing is a PAL game. But I
2633360	2640320	haven't noticed any cutoff. It could be the the PAL dialogue. The European dialogue applied to
2640320	2646880	the Japanese version. Yeah, yeah. But which now now I'm playing it. I know why it never came out
2646880	2655600	over here. It's a little dark and more than that tons of religious iconery and iconography and tons
2655600	2662240	of questionable speech. It's been a long time since I played it. And I don't think I got I only
2662240	2668160	beat Soul Blazer and got most of the way through Gaia. Terranigma, obviously the one not actually
2668160	2672720	released here. I got the least furthest and I played it but not not as much as you have at this
2672720	2682160	point. It just made it to America. And I just I spent the whole time like on my Wednesday stream
2682160	2688560	yelling at Columbus, who was completely different characterization, of course, in the game, you know,
2688560	2693040	fictional everything. But I was like, No, you don't want to spread love between nations. You
2693040	2696000	were trying to take people over and money and colonization and blah, blah, blah. I was just
2696000	2701120	like going off on him. History lesson. All right. How much further do you have to go? You think?
2702320	2708080	I don't know. I'm not looking ahead on purpose. Fair enough. I know. You don't want a spoiler.
2708080	2713360	So it's fine. Yeah. All right. Let's move on. We have more stories. Dark Soccer, I believe the next
2713360	2721760	one is yours. Also, Sony. Well, I remember how there was the whole gender discrimination lawsuit
2721760	2730800	and we brought it up several times in light of Activision. Well, to go over a little bit more
2730800	2739360	about this. It was a an employee named Emma, is it Majo or Majo? I don't know offhand, who was
2739360	2751200	an IT analyst, had filed a suit against Sony in November of 2021. That, you know, just basically
2751200	2755040	going over some of the same stuff we've already talked about, about women being paid less, denied
2755040	2760800	promotions, usually that type of thing. And then there were more allegations, of course, that came
2760800	2767680	out. Eight more employees came out and said it. The federal judge had ultimately moved to dismiss
2767680	2773200	the lawsuit in April, citing a lack of specific facts. But certain elements of the case could
2773200	2781440	proceed, specifically those relating to her dismissal from PlayStation and violations of
2781440	2786960	whistleblower protections. Those could be resubmitted with more detail. And that's what she
2786960	2792160	did. She did an amended version of the lawsuit with a narrower focus, has been submitted to the
2792160	2797840	California court, this time seeking damages for all women who worked at PlayStation's California
2797840	2805040	locations below the vice president level, rather than for all female PlayStation
2805040	2812880	employees across the U.S. The allegations are very similar, but basically going, you know, that
2812880	2818400	women were passed up for promotion in favor of male colleagues, unequal pay, retaliation. But now
2818400	2823520	it explicitly adds, and I'm quoting here, more specific facts about the class-wide policies and
2823520	2829200	practices which institutionalized gender-based discrimination and gender-based harassment.
2831680	2837440	These are also including some of the declarations that were made by the other employees who came
2837440	2843680	forward. And then a Deloitte study in which Sony was found to have a very low percentage of women
2843680	2850480	in management positions compared to its peers. Sony has not made a comment on it yet. So we'll
2850480	2856160	see how this plays out. This isn't something Sony is just going to be able to blink and make go away
2856160	2861200	though, because it's not often you hear about a lawsuit being dismissed, but then coming back with
2861200	2867040	kind of like the extra stuff to push it forward. So that's kind of what makes this particular
2867040	2871200	piece, I think, interesting is that, you know, since it was dismissed before, but now it's like,
2871200	2875440	no, we have the additional information needed. So it's going to be interesting to see where this
2875440	2881280	ends up. And Sony is definitely going to have to acknowledge it. And yeah, usually, you know, they
2882720	2888640	were getting into that E3 time of year. Sony historically has not had a lot of women on stage.
2888640	2897840	So it'd be interesting to see how they respond to that. All right. But until we have more info from
2897840	2901440	the courts, which will probably be years away, let's be real. I'm not sure there's a lot else
2901440	2905040	we can say on that. So for now, we'll go to our next story. Loki.
2906560	2913360	Yeah, so Sony is looking to bring some more of their titles to PC. And you may remember,
2913360	2920560	they've been doing that quite often with lots of past titles, including I'm trying to think I know,
2920560	2925520	I think Horizon was on its way to PC already. And then they've uncharted and all that stuff.
2925920	2931120	But no, they've already announced that they're going to be including quite a few of the first
2931120	2940560	party titles. So Ratchet and Clank, God of War, they're bringing uncharted last of us. And I'm not
2940560	2945520	sure what else they're looking to bring a horizon Forbidden West, of course, they publish that.
2946800	2953760	But yeah, and this is, um, I know that they're they're also are data miners had also found
2953760	2961120	returnal was one that was slated for a PC port as well. But the fact that they're bringing more
2961120	2966160	to PC is great. Especially since I can't get PlayStation five. Yeah, I was gonna say the
2966160	2970320	returnal is a really big deal. Because that's a PlayStation five exclusive. You can't play that
2970320	2975760	on PlayStation four. So the fact that that could possibly be something that you could play through
2975760	2982080	PC would be pretty great, I think. So we'll see what comes to that. But I'd be into that.
2983040	2989600	Yeah, probably why also why this isn't really such a surprise, but they had an investor call
2989600	2997680	that they said that no first party games will be released on PlayStation five in 2025. But they're
2997680	3004560	not planning on letting the platform die. I think you meant to say PlayStation four. No, no, I'm
3004560	3010480	sorry, PlayStation four. Yeah. So they're not gonna not gonna be releasing on 20 in 2025. So that's
3010480	3015040	still a few years away. But so in the meantime, they're planning on supporting PlayStation four,
3015600	3019920	for at least a few more years, probably because there's no PlayStation fives available.
3020800	3026080	They got to make money somehow. And they are making money quite, or they are selling quite a
3026080	3031120	few of those units, at least on PlayStation four. Wonder if we'll see in like, well, they've already
3031120	3036720	done like a redesign of PlayStation four, probably not another redesign, but maybe PlayStation five
3036720	3041920	redesign. No, people are kind of excited about something like that. And the Xbox series X and S
3041920	3046320	redesigns here. There was buzz about that earlier this week with absolutely no information
3046320	3053200	whatsoever on it just, I think people just kind of feel like it's the time for it. But, you know,
3053200	3058320	and I would I would definitely say, you know, from the old calendars, this would be about the year
3058320	3064080	you would see like a PlayStation hardware refresh or something. But I think the combination of the
3064080	3070080	pandemic, leading to the ship chip shortage, leading to why we can't have PlayStation fives
3070080	3075280	very easily. I'm not sure it's going to make that easy, especially if PlayStation VR two
3075920	3081040	is happening this year. That seems like a bit of a whammy to hit in the same year,
3081680	3087360	asking people to get a PlayStation VR two and a PS five Pro, I'm using my quoting fingers,
3087360	3092960	whatever it is, that's a lot for one year. So I feel like it's it's one or the other, not both.
3094960	3098320	Yeah. And also, I think that would be confusing, too, because you're going to have
3098320	3102000	basically three skews at that point. You're at the PlayStation four that you're still supporting
3102000	3106240	until twenty twenty five, your regular PlayStation five and your PlayStation five
3106240	3110800	pro would get confusing. Yeah. Not to say that they don't do that sort of weird
3110800	3117520	tearing things on their services already. So sure. Why not? Why not? Sony probably sells
3117520	3121520	40 times types of televisions. Why not three PlayStations? Yeah, they're going to they're
3121520	3124640	going to support the PlayStation four until twenty twenty five. It's only going to output,
3124640	3129200	though, a power resolutions and power refresh rates. So going forward, it's just saying,
3129200	3134880	beware of that. E3 VL in our chat points out it's easier to get PlayStation fives than before
3135520	3139600	GameStop and Wal-Mart have been doing events. Yeah, I've been generally hearing that, too,
3139600	3144960	that it's getting a little easier to get your hands on one. I just have at this point,
3144960	3150960	I'm not going to buy one until after the summer season because I need Sony to confirm
3151520	3155120	that they're not doing a hardware upgrade this year and then probably I'll buy one.
3155120	3160640	Well, I just I need one for five se 16. So whenever if 16 is coming out this year,
3160640	3164400	then fuck it. I'm buying a PlayStation five. But if it's not coming out this year,
3164400	3169280	I might still wait, especially with this news about the PC stuff and that everything is still
3169280	3175360	on PlayStation four. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. Yeah. Yeah. Quest Busters in the same boat
3175360	3179360	as me. It's a good boat and there's lots of room in this boat. I think there's a lot of us in it.
3179360	3186640	So all right. Well, when we might figure out more information could be Sony's state of play event,
3186640	3192560	which is scheduled for June 2, that's next week. So I don't know if this is supposed to be their
3192560	3198320	E3 replacement or what. It's only a 30 minute broadcast, but you can still put a lot of
3198320	3203440	information in 30 minutes and maybe, you know, honestly, honestly, truly, if you take the fluff
3204320	3208320	out of a 60 minute presentation, 90 minute presentation, you probably only have about
3208320	3214960	30 minutes left. So it'll be interesting to see what happens. They are saying new game reveals,
3214960	3220880	sneak peeks, updates, and they are including in that some exciting reveals from our third
3220880	3226960	party partners. And they are confirming a sneak peek at several games in development for PlayStation
3226960	3234880	VR two, which makes me think PS VR two is this year. But I could be wrong. And that's, that's
3234880	3239600	okay. But if I feel like if they're starting to show off those games, then that hardware is
3239600	3244640	probably a little sooner rather than later, especially if it will just inherently support
3244640	3249600	the PlayStation four VR library. You know, then that way, it's already going to have a library
3249600	3254640	when this comes out. So it'll be interesting to see what happens. Again, it's June 2, it's going
3254640	3260000	to be three o'clock Pacific, six o'clock Eastern. So sadly, that's still during the workday for me,
3260000	3265520	which is kind of annoying. So I'm not sure I can actually watch it live here on vogue, although
3266160	3276720	that is that's Thursday, I might be able to swing it. But no promises. So e3 vl says probably a
3276720	3283280	teaser for Summer Games Fest a week later, I don't expect Sony is going to be participating at the
3283280	3288640	same level at Summer Games Fest. I'm sure they will maybe have something thrown in there. But
3288720	3295520	probably they'll rely on their partners. ie Kojima, if Kojima is really up to something,
3295520	3299600	whatever it is, be it that they're going to confirm the Death Stranding sequel or
3300240	3306400	heaven forbid, the fans are going to get their way and he's involved with something meteor is that
3306400	3310480	that might be the place to confirm that. But that would probably be more of a third party announcement
3310480	3314800	type of thing. Although, I guess there was also that rumor going around that Sony might just
3314800	3321360	straight up bottom. So I don't know. We'll have to wait and see. We will have to wait and see and
3321360	3326320	y'all will just have to deal with waiting. Um, one thing you do get to see on Friday, though.
3326880	3330960	So again, now that we don't have e3 anymore, companies are kind of doing this whenever they
3330960	3338480	want. Sega is going to be doing an event on June 3. It's it. I believe that's eight o'clock in
3338480	3344000	Japan. That's going to be early morning for us. I don't know that quite the time conversion,
3344000	3350400	but it's going to be early early morning. Sega is going to do a Sega new project announcement
3350400	3356080	live stream. You can watch it on YouTube, Nico Nico and Twitter it is available there.
3358800	3364960	No idea what could be here. But a Twitter user has observed that the presenter lineup is the same
3364960	3372400	as the Genesis and Mega Drive mini live stream. So could it be something where we have more
3372960	3378960	Sega retro collection things coming? Who knows? I would you know, we've heard that Sega wants
3378960	3384800	to revive some of their old stuff like potentially crazy taxi jet set radio, things like that.
3384800	3388880	I think we'd all be extremely happy to hear a new jet set radios coming but
3389760	3395440	keep keep your expectations manageable. It's probably another Sonic game. No. Well,
3395440	3401360	it also in all seriousness, Sonic does have that. You know, everything's going open world now.
3401360	3405200	Sonic has that open world game coming out. But I don't I don't think this is about that because
3405200	3409280	they they've already announced it and they would have just said it's a stream about the new Sonic
3409280	3414640	game. But they're saying this is a new project announcement. So orange right says wait to hear
3414640	3422320	about their NFTs. You need to take that back right now. Orange right in chat says clearly
3422320	3428240	it's going to be the Dreamcast to JK you joke but if it was like a mini Dreamcast I think we'd all
3428240	3436560	be there for that. I mean, hell yeah. Speaking of NFTs, because it didn't hit the show roll
3436560	3440240	anywhere else. Did you hear about Bobby Blackwell's favorite series?
3442880	3453680	No, Nino Cooney just launched a mobile PC gotcha kind of title. And apparently it's it's it doesn't
3453680	3458800	have NFTs in it yet. But people have observed on their roadmap. It is something that's coming to
3458800	3465760	the game. I have some friends on Twitter that got into it before that news came out. But I,
3465760	3470480	I was like, I'm not going to play another gotcha game right now. I'm just I'm just not.
3472320	3476400	All right, everybody in chat is saying no, no, it's all right, fine. I'll talk about something
3476400	3482240	else. Questbuster does point out it's by net marble, which who depending on who you talk
3482240	3487360	to and gotcha circles is automatically a red flag. All right, let's move on. We,
3488080	3494240	we need to we need to talk about games from before the NFT era. So Dark Sakura four times. Yeah.
3496720	3508880	So this is rumor-y. This is conjecture. This is but in PlayStation Plus in Asian regions,
3509760	3517520	they saw artwork for Dino Crisis, the original Dino Crisis. The game is not in the catalog.
3518800	3525120	But actually, with the launch this week, it has fewer games that they than they expected to have.
3525840	3529920	But if the lead character for Dino Crisis is used on the cover,
3530720	3536720	highlighting the classic games, then the theory is going that Dino Crisis may be among them.
3537520	3543120	And it's a pretty convincing screenshot. Just looking it over. I mean, it's
3544560	3548960	where they go to classics catalog. She is their face and everybody.
3552000	3558480	So they're thinking that it is going to be coming out eventually. And I don't know what's
3559200	3562880	there. Yeah, it's it's so at any rate, it's a fair conclusion to jump to,
3562880	3567840	I think. No, no, no, um, some music started playing on my side, which only I could hear,
3567840	3574720	I'm sorry. But at any rate, I mean, we've had people asking for this game to be released in
3574720	3580960	some form or another for a while. I mean, it almost seems that the I mean, well, it was
3580960	3588000	actually just abandoned the whole IP there. So if we can have it coming back, that would be pretty
3588000	3596640	nice. All right. Let's listen evil is having this big surge of happy popularity. Why not Dino
3596640	3601600	Crisis? Why not? And then you know what, we can get a dinosaur killer in dead by daylight.
3602960	3608240	I'm all for that. You hear me behavior? Why not steal my ideas? Hire me? Why not a tie in with
3608240	3612880	Jurassic Park? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Jurassic Park dead by daylight. You ready? The
3612880	3620080	killer the velociraptor, although it could be the T or X, whatever. But the survivor is Laura Dern.
3621840	3625600	I just got Laura Dern in a video game needs to happen.
3625600	3627440	It did to the other one could be Malcolm.
3628160	3631280	It could be Yeah, that's true. It's true. Malcolm. Jeff Goldblum is Malcolm would be
3631280	3636480	good. Jeff Goldblum. I think Laura is Ellie or something like that. But yeah, I would I would,
3636480	3640400	like I just when I think of dead by daylight and gay rights, and it is Pride Month.
3640400	3644000	Laura Dern needs to be in the game.
3645200	3646800	So kind of hope we get the Babadook.
3648800	3655760	I'd love that. All right. Orange right does point out the T Rex would be too big. But then again,
3655760	3659680	they said the same thing about Ridley. Well, that's that's why I went for a velociraptor.
3659680	3665280	They they do all have to be built on a humanoid skeleton. Even the dredge is built on a humanoid
3665280	3669840	skeleton. I looked at the the the armature for it. Yeah, demo dog, because there are
3669840	3674480	common animations. Yeah. But actually, I'll tell you what's really funny is taking the
3674480	3679440	wraith skeleton and applying it to the pig. She just sort of hangs there really tall with her
3679440	3688480	head to the side. But But yeah, going back to the actual story. It'd be cool. People will be happy
3688480	3692000	about it. I don't see how you could go. Nevermind. I'm not going to say that because I know how they
3692000	3698240	could go wrong with it. But there you go. Before we get to our next story, a tip from
3698240	3702640	Phanara in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network. This isn't in our show role,
3702640	3708720	but it's a worthy headline that if you are a user of the epic game store, the Bioshock collection is
3708720	3712320	the free giveaway this week. So make sure to grab that. Thank you for the reminder. I hadn't grabbed
3712320	3717440	that yet. I got Borderlands. I thought it was just Bioshock three. No, it's the whole collection.
3717440	3722480	It's the collection. Yeah. It's one to an infinite. Yeah. So which I've already got
3722480	3727680	the others. And I have to go grab the others. I believe collection would be the HD remasters
3727680	3732880	on top of that. So because Yeah, yeah, they they remastered the one and two at some point. So yeah,
3732880	3738080	it's definitely worth picking up if you don't already have it. So cool. All right, makes makes
3738080	3742400	me wonder if they're finally about to announce another one because you know, supposedly he's
3742400	3748800	been working on one for a while. And summer's coming up. And that's when they announce new
3748800	3754400	stuff. And actually, this brings I just thought of a problem with them doing Dino crisis. Hmm.
3755520	3759680	The dinosaurs are so inaccurate now now that we know that they all had feathers.
3760400	3766000	Oh, they'd have to completely redo all the dinosaurs. They are doing that in Jurassic Park.
3766560	3770000	I know. Well, they're wrong. Well, it could it doesn't have to be right.
3770240	3775200	You know, if you could tell you what because they combined it with frog DNA or something like that.
3775200	3782240	So it kind of does bug me now though, going back and seeing all these representatives of what
3782240	3789200	people thought they look like and now actually knowing no, they're giant chickens. Giant chickens.
3790080	3795680	I'm not I'm not taking you to see 80s horror movies and all the all the things they get
3795680	3804080	wrong about a multitude of things creatures. Blood physics, those dinosaurs were real.
3806000	3810560	That's true. They were they were I mean, humans didn't live with dinosaurs. That's a myth. But
3810560	3817200	you know, this wasn't the Flintstones. Alright, moving on, let's get into a few more stories for
3817200	3820960	you. And then we'll get to the classic game of the week. And all I'm going to say I'm not going
3820960	3825280	to give it away. But I'm just going to say this week selection is one of those games where you're
3825280	3831760	going to go. Oh, not this. This isn't this isn't old enough. This is not old enough.
3832960	3835840	I'll leave you on that note. Hold on. For now, Loki.
3837040	3842800	Yes. So the there's members at Activision Blizzard, the employees have formed a new
3842800	3850720	committee to try to combat the sexism, inequality and gender bias that they've experienced at the
3850800	3858160	studio. I know surprising. The workplace responsibility committee. They have a four
3858160	3865360	page document that basically includes their demands. And that includes a private lactation
3865360	3871040	support 12 weeks of paid parental leave the implementation of independent investigations
3871040	3878880	for employee complaints and incidents. Yeah, I wonder why they would need that. You know,
3880800	3886080	but yeah, it's it's nice to see these groups kind of more organizing, although you know,
3886080	3891280	it would really help them a little bit better as if they just had a union across the whole company.
3894960	3897360	I think we're going to get there. It's just a matter of time.
3900320	3906240	We'll see. So the 12 weeks paid off or time off for parental leave is basically opposed to the
3906240	3910720	10 weeks that they currently get. So they're asking for more benefits in that sense.
3914640	3918880	Yeah, I mean, I don't know, especially with all the eyes kind of on Activision right now
3918880	3924000	with all of the allegations coming out from them. I mean, it might help them with some of this
3924000	3930320	momentum, right? And what they're asking for is certainly not unreasonable. Like you might be
3930320	3934400	sitting there going, gosh, you're asking for this is actually there's there's a lot of companies out
3934400	3939120	there that have these sorts of you know, benefits for employees since you know, that's how you get
3939120	3944080	a company of those type of benefits make you want to work or for an employee or for an employer and
3944080	3948640	stay loyal to it when they have those sorts of things. So you know, and especially when people
3948640	3952560	are abandoning about Activision Blizzard left and right because of everything the company's been
3952560	3956320	going through. I don't think these sorts of protections are too much to ask quite frankly.
3956960	3962640	So all right. Well, moving on before we get to the classic game of the week, let's talk about
3962640	3968000	a classic archive because I think this is pretty cool. And it's being done by an Embracer group,
3968000	3974240	which is also known as THQ Nordic back in the day. And plus, you know, you hadn't heard of
3974240	3982080	Embracer group a lot recently until that whole recent acquisition of the Square Enix West Coast
3982080	3988320	stuff. Or not West Coast, what am I saying? Sorry, Square Enix, like, well, because Crystal Dynamics
3988320	3993120	is on the West Coast, there's some other but like Montreal and all that stuff, the stuff in
3993120	3998960	the Americas, basically, that Embracer took from Square Enix. But Embracer is doing some other
3998960	4004480	stuff as well, including the Embracer games archive, where they want to save as much of the
4004480	4011520	games industry as possible. They have a whole new website, Embracer.com slash about slash games
4011520	4018560	archive. And that is a place where they kind of show you more about what this archive is all
4018560	4022400	about. It's not really an online archive, it's actually a physical archive. And you can see lots
4022400	4029360	of pictures there. They have already archived 50,000 games, consoles and accessories. If you
4029360	4033840	want to visit the hub, though, and I'm not hearing it's open to the public yet. But if you want to
4033840	4038640	visit the hub, it's in Karlstad, Sweden, to have a little trip to make for most of you out there.
4039200	4043920	But the archive does have a CEO, an archive assistant, a technical engineer and a supply
4043920	4049280	manager. So Embracer is putting money into this by paying those salaries. And that's worth noting
4049280	4053520	is that they're, they're putting their money where their mouth is literally, which is kind of neat
4053520	4058640	with that. They're trying to build a database, and they're going to be cataloging, they're hoping to
4058640	4064400	network and collaborate with initiatives, museums and institutions. And they also do intend to
4064480	4071360	exhibit part of the archive locally and with like traveling satellite exhibitions, basically,
4072080	4077120	they do not have a wanted list of things they need yet. But if a collector wants to get in touch,
4077120	4083520	they sure would like to hear from you. In a comment, David Bostrom said, Imagine a place
4083520	4088400	this is CEO, imagine a place where physical video games, consoles and accessories are gathered at
4088400	4093120	the same place. And think about how much that could mean for games culture and enabling video
4093120	4098960	games research. This journey has just been started. And we're at an early stage at Embracer
4098960	4102800	games archive, we believe that games carry a heritage we're celebrating and safeguarding for
4102800	4107600	the future. Our goal is clear, we want to archive and save as much of the video games industry as
4107600	4114080	possible. So that's pretty neat that they are doing that. And I will say this, it's basically
4114080	4119920	like dark soccer as vault, but like on a much larger scale. So what this is, it's pretty cool.
4120800	4127440	So very cool. The vault is kind of downscaled unless you add the pinballs to it, then they're
4127440	4132000	all going to be in the garage. Fair enough. Fair enough. All right. Well, as promised,
4132000	4135440	we're going to take a trip down memory lane in our next segment.
4135440	4151520	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4151520	4156480	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
4158160	4160080	And dark soccer, what did you pick tonight?
4160080	4169760	There we go, sorry. I picked Journey. I'd hit the button, but it didn't trigger it.
4169760	4170400	That's right.
4170400	4174720	Yeah, not the old Journey, which I've already done. Not Journey to Syllabus,
4174720	4177600	which I've already done. But Journey that came out in 2012.
4178560	4181600	So yes, this game is 10 years old, and we're all having a moment.
4183200	4186080	Well, you might. I'm not.
4186080	4186560	I am.
4187520	4194320	Um, so it came out in North America on March 13, 2021, and in Europe on March 14,
4194320	4201520	2021, probably because they actually did get a simultaneous release, and it was time difference.
4202720	4209040	So it is an indie adventure game that was made by That Game Company and Santa Monica Studio,
4209040	4215760	published by Sony, directed by Jenova Chen. It was released on PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation
4215760	4221360	Network, and then ported to PS4 July 2015, and then on Windows and iOS.
4223360	4226160	So when you play Journey, you're playing a robed figure
4226880	4231280	who is traveling toward a mountain. And other people are playing at the same time.
4232320	4239360	And they don't tell you first that you're playing a multiplayer game.
4239360	4245360	You run into other robed figures. And sometimes you help them.
4246000	4248240	And sometimes you ignore them or they ignore you.
4249680	4254640	But the whole thing is that the only way that you have to communicate with each other is a
4254640	4263280	little musical chime. And it will change this cloth that you find in different levels into
4263280	4269040	this vibrant red. And it allows you to progress through the levels.
4271200	4278480	They wanted to try to evoke these emotions and the sense of bonding with people as you go through.
4279360	4284800	And the music also dynamically responds to your actions. So you have a single theme,
4284800	4294160	but with variations as you go through. Honestly, it won many Game of the Year awards.
4294160	4301280	It won Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Actually, no, it got a nomination for Best Score
4301280	4310080	Soundtrack for Visual Media in the 2013 Grammys. There is a collector's edition that has the other
4310960	4315520	of that game company's previous titles and other media that came out in August 2012.
4316480	4323600	So it's all wordless. The cutscenes are just visual.
4326560	4330240	I don't really want to go into spoilers on it, because I do think that if people haven't played
4330240	4334480	it, they really should sit down and do it. But you can play through the whole thing in
4334720	4341680	two or three hours, if I recall correctly. Now, going into the development of this one.
4342400	4348400	Now, the first two games that that game company did was Flow and Flower. And I played Flower.
4348400	4352080	Did you ever play Flower? I did. It's great.
4353600	4361200	And so the development for Journey started in 2009 after Flower was released. And they had an
4361200	4367120	18-person development team, mostly people who worked on the previous two games.
4370880	4379440	But basically, Sony wanted the game done in a year rather than the three. But they knew that
4379440	4382880	they would need an extension on this one, because doing it in a year was unrealistic.
4383760	4389600	It took even longer than they thought it would, because the communication aspect really was what
4389600	4395360	took a lot of effort. And then the team was originally like seven people and grew to 18
4395360	4401280	people. And then Sony's extension ran out, but the game still didn't bring the emotions that
4401280	4407440	they wanted. So Sony gave them one more year and exceeded even that. The project, though,
4408000	4414960	was causing a lot of problems, a lot of stress, a lot of arguments. They had to reduce over time
4414960	4422480	because of project burnout. And then they had almost been driven to bankruptcy in the final
4422480	4431440	months of development, and some of the developers had gone unpaid. Because the whole thing is that
4433520	4440800	for them to just get it out, they had to basically let the game go. Just finish it
4441760	4446480	and learning to let go of those ideas that they couldn't make it into the game
4446480	4450720	and just work well together. And that ended up actually kind of going into the theme of the game.
4451680	4456240	The whole point was to make you feel small and give you this sense of awe about where you were.
4457360	4466560	It wanted to move beyond the competitive nature of most games. And there actually was a prototype
4466560	4475280	called Dragon that had players trying to draw away a large monster, but they discarded it when
4475280	4482560	it was basically players were ignoring each other to do their own objectives. And so they designed
4482560	4488960	Journey as, well, their analogy for it was like a Japanese garden where they remove all the elements
4488960	4495360	that didn't fit so that the emotions would stay. It was very minimalist. With that minimalist
4495360	4503760	approach, with it being less complicated, it was perfect, basically. They said that three of their
4503760	4512880	25 testers cried when they finished the game. It is based off of Middle Eastern concepts,
4512880	4519040	some Arabic culture, some of the architecture, and also a little bit of Chinese and Tibetan
4519040	4525840	cultural influences. Of course, that comes from Chen's background. And they wanted it to be fully
4525840	4534240	cooperative without forcing it and they wanted to eliminate all need of competition. You know,
4535360	4543360	they felt that caring about the other player could be diluted by too much going on in the game
4544000	4546880	and that they wanted to show the positive side of humanity.
4548080	4557760	So when this came out, there was the PlayStation Home Game Space. There was, you know, that came out
4557760	4562720	with the release of the game. The Collector's Edition retail one came out in August, like I said
4562720	4568480	earlier. There's also, like I said with that, they also released Flow and Flower with director
4568480	4574880	commentaries, art galleries, and soundtracks of all the games, non-related mini games, and
4574880	4580080	more content for PlayStation 3. And then they did a hardcover book called The Art of Journey.
4581600	4592720	And then it kept coming out and basically the port that came out for Windows and iOS
4593600	4601600	was done by Annapurna Interactive. The music was done by Austin Wintory,
4601600	4608240	who also worked on Flow. And he worked with the sound designer because they wanted all of these
4609200	4617200	actions to be interactive, a little bit more like what you have. Like I said earlier,
4617200	4621920	as you do certain things in the game, the music is going to switch over to a variation.
4622720	4630240	And the soundtrack is actually available on iTunes and PlayStation Network.
4631920	4638560	And it, like I said, it was also Grammy nominated. There's also, this in 2012, there was a download
4638560	4645200	only album on Bandcamp called Journey Bonus Bundle, which had different variations of themes
4645200	4650080	from Journey and Flow. And then a full soundtrack was released after that. There was a piano
4650080	4654560	arrangement called Transfiguration that came out after that, also on Bandcamp and as a physical
4654560	4662080	album. And then a two record vinyl version that was released in 2015. There was a Kickstarter for
4662080	4671200	a Journey live concert tour, and they will have people playing it and have the ensemble react in
4671200	4680720	real time. It had a modified version of the game that they use with the music disabled.
4683200	4689920	It well surpassed its goal. Then on March 2022, so this year on the game's 10th anniversary,
4691040	4695040	Wintory released a rearranged version of Journey soundtrack with a full orchestra done by the
4695040	4700800	London Symphony Orchestra, the London Voice Choir, and cellist Tina Guo. It's called
4700800	4707120	Traveler, a Journey Symphony with reimagined elements and larger sets of instruments and
4707120	4715360	more vocalists. Basically it's bigger and better and more moving. But yeah, this game got so many
4715360	4724720	accolades. The Metacritic scores for both PS3 and PS4 were 92 of 100. Everywhere, there's not a
4724720	4729920	score on here that's less... Okay, there was one that gave it an eight out of 10. It was Edge,
4729920	4734000	but are they around anymore? I don't think so. I think they are actually, but it's all right.
4735840	4740480	But Touch Arcade gave it a four and a half of five stars and everyone else was either
4740480	4749040	a nine of 10 or a 10 of 10. The only thing that really drew any criticism was the length and the
4749040	4759280	pacing. Not all players appreciated a deliberate melancholic pace as one critic said. That was
4759280	4770160	actually from the Edge review. They were basically saying it wasn't complicated enough. Well, that
4770160	4776720	person's entitled to their bad opinion. But they also said it could be compared to a concert or
4776720	4783120	well-directed film or a book you've been looking forward to. That it will create memories that last.
4787360	4793520	All right, is that it? That's it. All right, classic game of the week. Journey, not to be
4793520	4799760	confused with a 1980s rock band that also had their own video game, but the classic that was
4799760	4804160	released on the PlayStation 3. And you know, just to, you know, obviously Jamie Scott had given us
4804160	4807440	the rundown of this game's history and so forth, but there's a couple quick things I want to say.
4807440	4812000	Number one, I really believe this is one of the best video games they've ever made. Like I think
4812000	4818080	it goes beyond a classic game for me and that's my opinion. But I think this is truly one of the
4818080	4824800	best video games out there, period. And I know now that we're 10 years out, we talk a little more
4824800	4832080	openly about spoilers. But I think the fact that they hid that it was a multiplayer game
4832800	4839120	and you discovered that as you were playing it, but yet were not able to communicate in a
4839120	4843280	traditional method with the other player. I thought it was downright revolutionary at the time
4843920	4852800	and really just added to the art that this game was. And yes, as Bobby was pointing out in the
4852800	4858160	chat, Robin, I saw that concert. I don't know if this is like, maybe this thing they did at
4858160	4863680	MagFest, they're taken on the road or something like that. But I will say one of the best gaming
4863680	4869520	culture things I've ever seen was kind of what you were describing there, but they did that at
4869520	4877040	MagFest. God, I've lost all track of time. I want to say maybe that was 2017. I don't remember what
4877040	4884240	year. Bobby will probably remember better. But that was, yeah, that was when they actually
4884240	4889520	performed the whole game while somebody was playing it and Austin Montori was there conducting
4889520	4896640	it. And they were online and another player did join and was helpful. And that was all stuff you
4896640	4903040	can't really control. So that's so cool. Bobby does confirm the MagFest concert was the precursor
4903040	4908480	to the Kickstarter. Well, I'm not surprised because I'm sure a lot of people felt how we felt
4908480	4913200	about that concert, that it was just, it was outstanding and it deserved to be seen by more
4913200	4921680	people. So yeah, just a little personal touch on the game there for me, but I truly believe this
4921680	4926240	is one of those, like, I don't necessarily have a list of like 50 games you must play before you
4926240	4929840	die. But like, if I did have a list, this would be on it for sure. I think this is one of the greatest
4929840	4937600	video games I've ever made. I really do. There it is. Classic game of the week. Journey. All right.
4938400	4943760	Good pick. Good, good pick. All right. Let's make sure my co hosts are visible again. There we go.
4943760	4949600	And then we can get back into some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other headlines.
4949600	4956400	So Loki, we'll go to you. Well, since Rob already had mentioned it in his gaming week,
4956400	4962720	Nomad Sky has another update. So they've added Space Whales. And I didn't say anything about
4962720	4967440	the Space Whales because I haven't gotten there yet. I thought you did because you mentioned like
4967440	4974400	the whole organic thing. Well, shit, I ruin everything. So it's Nomad Sky Leviathan.
4975200	4983280	They've got a whole new kind of roguelike mode that's in it as well. And yeah, the giant Space
4983280	4987040	Whales, which are hardly I mean, it looks more like a space squid than the Space Whale,
4987040	4995600	but whatever it does. Fish, free space fash. Although whales technically not fish, so
4997840	4999680	I said space cuttlefish.
5002400	5009840	And then on Nintendo Switch Online, there are some updates coming in May. So we have on the
5009840	5016400	Super Nintendo Rival turf and Kongo's caper. And then pinball on the NES.
5017680	5021840	Pinball on the NES was actually kind of rad for its time. I mean, you know,
5021840	5025120	I had it and it was all right. I played that when you can have pinbot
5025680	5031600	on NES. Well, I wish I wish they would put that on Switch Online and hard driving while they're
5031600	5039360	at it. But what and you know, pinbot was so good because, well, A, the soundtrack was great. Rare
5039360	5043600	always knocked it out of the park in that department. But B, it did stuff that pinball
5043600	5049680	tables don't do, which was controversial at the time. But like there were parts where like, like,
5049680	5053520	didn't aliens come out and would like eat the ball and stuff like that? Like it did. The game
5053520	5058240	did things that the table can't do because like, yeah, it it literally breaks the laws of gravity
5058240	5063600	and physics. But it's a video game. You're allowed to do that. So that's that's what I liked about
5063600	5072800	it. All right. Anyway, Darsakha, what do you have? Just some Stadia news. So on June 1, there's going
5072800	5078160	to be a launch of Through the Darkest of Times from Handy Games. It's a historical resistance
5078160	5088720	strategy game. And then there's also Mighty Switch Force Collection will also be coming out from Way
5088720	5097840	Forward. And it it looks actually like it's pretty fun. And then there is also Those Who Remain
5099280	5106160	by Wired Productions to be coming out. And I've actually seen some pretty nice games recently
5106160	5112320	coming out on Stadia, including like some really good freebies. But the Switch Force Collection
5112320	5116960	is the one I'm actually kind of happy about it. It's a very Gunstar Heroes sort of vibe.
5118960	5126800	Especially since hold on, there's one thing on here about the Oh, yeah. So you have characters
5126800	5136800	called Corporal. Hold on, Ugly Secret Baby is one of them is one of the character names.
5138720	5140880	All right. This is probably who I would play as.
5142240	5147520	All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that are
5147520	5152480	coming to a store shelf or a digital shelf near you. Loki, we'll start with you.
5153360	5159200	Yeah, not a whole lot of things. So we have a game called Silt coming out on PC,
5159200	5165680	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. We have Card Shark
5165680	5174480	on PC and Nintendo Switch. We have a game that shows you guys. No, I think this this is a
5174480	5180160	Devolver Digital title. It's Oh, it's not. It's an adventure. It's a little different.
5180160	5186640	Yeah, it's not the game show. I'm sorry. And of course, you know, you guys have to answer. Do you
5186640	5192480	do you guys not have phones? Because Diablo immortal is coming out. Oh, boy. And it's on
5192480	5201440	PC as well, in case you don't have a phone. And Android. And then loopers is going to be coming
5201440	5207840	out on Nintendo Switch and five memories of my time with you on a switch and PlayStation four.
5207840	5212800	That's it. All right, going to Japan and looking at some of the releases over there on the Nintendo
5212800	5217440	Switch indigo seven is out in a regular and special edition. It is the English version of
5217440	5222000	the game but it is getting a localized release to Japan this week. Also the quintessential

5233600	5239360	on the PlayStation five indigo seven in the actually all of those games. Excuse me. No,
5239360	5243200	I was just accidentally looking at the same list. My bad. Let me try this again.
5243920	5248080	On the PlayStation five this week. Okay, well, that's why because nothing is out on the
5248080	5255760	PlayStation five this week in Japan. But on the PlayStation four, we have that same the quintessential
5255760	5260880	quintuplets the movie game is really the only release on PlayStation four. That's it a little
5260880	5268400	bit of a slower week in Japan. Dark Sakura only four things on the list. They're all on the 31st.
5270560	5276480	Snow runner for the big three zombie night terror on switch and the last two on PlayStation is
5276480	5283680	Autobahn police simulator three and in some in some this enhanced edition. All right.
5284960	5290720	Just a few more stories for you and then we'll invite your calls via discord at almost a twitch
5291280	5294960	that's where you watch twitch.tv slash vog network. But to participate further,
5294960	5297920	you can join our discord and you can also talk with us throughout the week.
5297920	5301760	Some folks share stories in our chat and that's great. I always love to see the discussion that
5301760	5308000	happens on that during the week. vog network.com that's vog network.com slash discord to join our
5308000	5313120	server there. We'll get to some of the roundtable talk here in a minute. But first we have a few
5313120	5319760	more headlines starting off with Loki. Yes, so there is a brand new game that's been announced by
5320720	5327040	the game grumps. And of course, you may remember them for their YouTube channel as well as dream
5327040	5332800	daddy, you know, who could forget that wonderful dating sim game. But now they're going to be doing
5332800	5339440	never watch their YouTube but watched a lot of people play dream daddy. That's true recently.
5339440	5346000	Yeah, recently. But you know, this one is going to be a little bit different. So it is a slasher
5346640	5354000	inspired game from with a kind of a unique looking visual style. It kind of reminds me a lot of like,
5354640	5360560	not, it's not quite PlayStation, but it's like early 90s. Like remind me like a loan in the
5360560	5366560	dark, but with just better graphics, I guess. I'm kind of creepy looking. They said it's supposed
5366560	5375280	to be a narrative driven psychological horror game. And it is, you know, full of puzzles,
5375280	5380400	dialogue choices, and of course, evading the killer. And apparently no two game or no two
5380400	5386080	playthroughs are going to be the same. The AI looks looks pretty cool. It's supposed to be
5386080	5392960	coming to steam and the Epic Games store and consoles later this year. Interesting. Well,
5392960	5397600	you know, dream daddy was quite the cult hit. And this seems to have all the makings of what,
5397600	5403520	you know, is popular on Twitch. So I'll be very, very curious to see how it goes. Mike Defton
5403520	5408880	chat says Yeah, it's like PlayStation one graphics and horror. SSJ 100. Matt says the Game Grumps
5408880	5414640	folks have been polarizing in the past. Not sure how it is now. I just it's I just don't follow a
5414640	5419600	lot of the YouTube stuff. But I know there's probably a lot more people watching that the
5419600	5425760	watching this. So it's fine. All good. Dark soccer, what do you have for us?
5428560	5436080	There is a game that was unveiled in 2020. That was by the creator of Dead Space,
5436080	5444640	Glenn Schofield is called the Callisto protocol. And it was very dead spacey, very scary. And then
5445520	5452720	they announced also though that the game would be set in the PUBG universe, which kind of surprising
5452720	5459680	for that. I mean, it's a horror game, a third person horror game set in 2320. And you are like
5459680	5469360	in this prison colony on Jupiter's moon Callisto. And the connection was that the developer striking
5470240	5479600	distance is explicitly established by PUBG Battlegrounds publisher to create narrative
5479600	5485760	driven games. So they thought it would be a good involvement in there. So when they went in,
5485760	5491040	they had like this lore team and writing the story and then going into it. And then but they
5491040	5495120	said that the horror game would have been pretty far out along the timeline. And then eventually,
5495120	5500960	they just dropped it all together. So it grew into its own world and is no longer associated
5500960	5506400	with the PUBG universe. All right. So long, farewell.
5507840	5511680	I honestly didn't know PUBG had a universe. I didn't either, to be honest. So
5512400	5516960	everything has a universe. Yeah, that's true. That's true. All right. Yeah. Well,
5517520	5521200	a lot of people have custom universes in this next game, right? Loki?
5521200	5529520	Yeah, I mean, I don't know if we go completely universal so long. But yeah, I know a lot of
5529520	5537840	people can get pretty involved with The Sims. So The Sims 4 has added a custom pronouns update,
5537840	5542320	I guess. I'm not really sure if it's an update or if it's just like an add on they have it.
5542320	5548800	But anyways, now when you create a sim, you can also completely customize, you know,
5548800	5555120	the different pronouns that they use in the game. So pretty awesome. Now that it's opened up a lot
5555120	5565840	of the the representation as well in there. I think that's great. That's great. Just in
5565840	5573760	time for Pride Month, which is actually great. So yeah, it's also just neat to hear about Sims 4,
5573760	5577360	because that games, that game could practically be a classic game of the week. I feel like it's
5577360	5581760	been out a while, you know, they were, you know, they're obviously the original Sims goes back to
5581760	5586080	what like 99 or something like that. And then, you know, Sims two and three didn't take a long,
5586080	5589600	long time after that. But then I feel like Sims 4 has kind of been where the series been out for
5589600	5593600	a long time. Maybe just because it's been so expensive. I'm just surprised we're not talking
5593600	5598240	about a Sims 5 yet in a while. Yeah, it's been a while. I don't know when the original came out.
5598240	5603280	But but there's been like, like 20 expansions for The Sims 4. Hasn't there? I know dark soccer knows
5603280	5607360	more about the series than I do. Let's put it this way. It's like it's about almost eight years old
5607360	5613200	now. I don't think I've touched the game in three years. Wow. Okay, yyr says September 2, 2014 was
5613200	5618080	the release date. So it is. It's not classic game of the week old, but it's getting there.
5618080	5622640	It's getting there. Almost there. It's almost it's almost like pulling a grind that's out of five at
5622640	5626800	this point. Except they haven't released it a million times. No, that's true. That's true.
5627440	5632160	All right. Well, one more story on the show for you tonight. And this has to do with another
5632160	5641120	classic recently unveiled. And that is Marble Madness 2, Marble Man, finally available to be
5641120	5647200	played in an emulator. Now, these machines did exist and you would see them once in a great
5647200	5651360	while. I know California extreme would get it once in a while. I think dark soccer, you probably
5651360	5657760	played it there probably talked about it on the show. But this is notable because the collectors
5657760	5663760	that had these machines and this machine, I don't think it ever really came out beyond a prototype
5663760	5668960	like it was a fully realized prototype, because they tested it, but it didn't do well with the
5668960	5674960	test groups. I think Atari was blaming trackballs were the problem. They wanted to do joysticks and
5674960	5679840	all that stuff, which is I don't know, it's kind of silly, but they didn't really release this game
5679840	5686480	wide. So collectors had this game, and they didn't want the value of the game to be devalued. So
5686480	5691280	nobody was putting it on the internet. Well, guess what happened this last week, it finally
5691280	5697120	made somebody broke the code, and it made its way to the internet. And you know what, I'm sure the
5697120	5701840	collectors will be fine. I what Bobby was getting into this on his show a little bit when this
5701840	5707600	happened to another game several years ago, the collectors, they don't lose any value. But yeah,
5707600	5713520	ROM image of Marble Madness 2 started showing up on the internet archive and some other websites.
5713520	5720080	And now it is actually playable in MAME. Some folks wonder and it was it was leaked by the
5720080	5730080	handle dank 2079, which go off dank. But I guess the ROMs have 20 year old timestamps on them.
5730080	5734720	So people are wondering, is this just old stuff that leaked? But then folks are saying, well,
5734720	5742480	it might be the the ROM readers could be using really old PCs, where Windows 95 is still the
5742480	5750160	operating system. And that's why it's showing as such an old thing. So as Joe had a mat wondering
5750160	5755360	if Mark Cerny, who is now with Sony worked on this, or if this is an Atari deal, Mark Cerny
5755360	5759440	did not work on the sequel, but he was he is very well known for having worked on the original
5759440	5764640	Marble Madness. So anyway, long story short, you can finally experience Marble Madness 2 after all
5764640	5770240	this time from MAME, which is interesting because we were just talking about romp or you know,
5770240	5774720	gaming history preservation earlier in the show. And now the you know, this is a way where many
5774720	5779520	people can really experience this for the first time. But there's another gag about this a lot of
5779520	5786160	people kind of saying, you know what, it's not a very good game. Like a lot of the magic that made
5786160	5792800	the original special. It's kind of lost in this. For example, from the Internet Archive, Jason
5792800	5798880	Scott said, Marbles Madness 2 is a classic example of when a beautiful game is created, and the sequel
5798880	5804720	completely forgets why the original is great. I'm excited. This long anticipated game is out in the
5804720	5812880	wild, because people can realize how uninteresting the game is and move on. Ouch, it is shady. That
5812880	5821120	is very shit. Where's my RuPaul shade button? But anyway, it's still still though, it's a game of
5821120	5826480	historical importance for sure. And you know what now you can play it and see for yourself. So
5827040	5833120	Marble Madness 2. I can't tell you where to get it because technically downloading ROMs is piracy.
5833680	5837680	But I can just tell you once on the internet, always on the internet.
5837680	5838480	Always on the internet.
5839200	5845680	This is a game a lot of people are talking about. Yeah, right. And YYR is saying, you know,
5845680	5850160	as we're talking about being shady, and it's not very good. YYR is suggesting, maybe that's why
5850160	5857520	it was never released. It's a good thought, YYR could be. I don't know, though, there were a lot
5857520	5864400	of companies that were releasing shitty games like that doesn't always stop them. But fair point.
5864400	5868480	Maybe they didn't want to tarnish the Marble Madness brand. I don't know. Although has there
5868480	5877200	ever been a Marble Madness game since? Nope. There should be. That's, you know what, if Atari wants
5877200	5882640	us to pay attention to their fucking VCS thing, that that computer that PC computer, why don't
5882640	5888000	you put a new Marble Madness game on it for starts? That would be pretty cool. Anyway.
5889440	5894640	SJ100Matt says Bob Flanagan did lead the development for Marble Madness 2, who worked on
5894640	5900560	the original with Mark Cerny, and coincidentally also worked on the Sims games in recent years. So
5900560	5906080	we love a callback and how things come full circle. All right, we're gonna go to the list
5906080	5913040	or roundtable where we open up our mailbag. Participate at orangesonsrated.com, as well as
5913040	5919920	any questions you might have in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash a vog network. And any calls you
5919920	5925120	might have over at vog at network.com slash discord. I don't think I saw emails this week,
5925120	5931120	but I'll check in with DarkSakra. Was that a no? One. Oh, there is one. Okay. No, not a one. Not
5931120	5935280	a one. Oh, I'm sorry. Your audio for some reason, like the very beginning is dropping. I don't know
5935280	5940240	why. So because I have to my I had to move my mic to a different place. My mic arm fell off your
5940240	5945680	noise gate. Okay, got it. Got it. Um, noise gate. I'm not using a noise gate. Oh, interesting.
5946320	5952480	My mic arm fell off and I had to put my mic back together. Okay. It's tis but a scratch, though.
5952480	5957360	Ah, well, arms off. We hope you'll send us an email in a future week participate at
5957360	5961920	orangesonsrated.com. Usually if you don't send this email, that is the chance for DarkSakra
5961920	5965520	and I to talk about drag race. I don't know if you've checked out the latest season yet,
5965520	5970400	but another episode came out. And I got this season. I don't always watch drag race anymore.
5970400	5976320	I don't watch every season. This latest season. Very good. This latest episode. Not as good as
5976320	5980400	the second episode, but still pretty good. Some really good looks. And it was a ball.
5980400	5985680	It was a ball episode. And if I can spoil just a little something that's super cool DarkSakra.
5986560	5994000	It was a it was in part a Vanna White inspired ball. And Vanna White was there. And she actually
5994000	6000000	read all of but she didn't judge. She just was there on the main stage as you say, up next,
6000000	6006560	Raja with a look or whatever. But they didn't tell the queens that Vanna was going to be there.
6006560	6009840	So when they come out and start walking down the runway, you see them look over and then they go,
6010320	6016160	like, they suddenly recognize her and they freak out. So it's cute. It's worth a watch.
6017120	6022800	Anyway, Stan jinx monsoon end of tweet. But honestly, you could stand anybody in this
6022800	6027440	season. They're all they're all winners for a reason. Like anybody is good in this in this
6027440	6033040	season. Like I just I want them all to win. Can we break up the crown? Can we? That's what I'd
6033040	6038400	like to do. All right. Well, before we get to some last minute stories, maybe we do have a call in
6038400	6043040	the green room. So I'd like to go ahead and get to it. Let's get to it. Hello, you are on Orange
6043040	6052000	Lounge radio. Who's this? This is why we are Hi, why we are How are you? Oh, not so bad. Not so
6052000	6058720	bad for a Sunday night. Got a holiday tomorrow. I don't have to get up early and get the get the
6058720	6065280	toddler ready for daycare and rush to get out the door. And you know, get her dressed have her
6065280	6070400	reject her clothing. No, I have to pick something else. No, I don't want that one. I don't want that
6070400	6077040	one either. wind up getting 10 minutes late to work. But since I'm the only one in the office,
6077040	6084160	nobody notices Thank goodness. But I can't believe your kid is at that a I mean, like,
6084160	6091040	of course, but it's just like, this pandemic has just my sense of time is so screwed. And like,
6091040	6093120	I'm like, Wait, don't you still have a baby?
6094800	6096320	Baby is gonna be for next month.
6097840	6107040	Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Right. It's only a year younger than my dear friend melody and Mel B. If you go
6107040	6112400	back in the DDR days, Mel B was very well known for freestyle stuff. Their child is only about a
6112400	6119600	year older. So it's it's wild that and I always I'm like, isn't isn't see still a baby? Like,
6120880	6127120	what happened? Anyway, sorry. Oh, my camera wasn't on. Sorry about that. I didn't want to mess up
6127120	6131360	your Oh, that's okay. You know, it's fine video there. I have to do different shots depending on
6131360	6135360	how many people are on the stream anyway. So it's and then sometimes it doesn't always go to the
6135360	6140720	right spot. So I have to make adjustments on the fly. Like what can you do? So anyway, hi, it's
6140720	6147520	good to see why we are what what to what do we owe a phone call tonight? Well, normally when I
6147520	6152880	call in, I call in because you know, I want to comment on something on a previous week or you
6152880	6158880	know, I want to shamelessly plug what I'm working on or you know, what have you. But this time,
6158880	6169680	it's different. Okay. This time, I am calling in to throw down. All right. You see? Oh, don't worry.
6169680	6174320	You're not the target. Okay, good. Oh,
6177120	6181360	what in the heck am I looking at behind you? Loki? Geez. All right. Anyway,
6183680	6186880	I'm not even sure I want to know I missed the first hour. Sorry.
6188160	6194400	It's fine. But anyway, so I was catching up on recent episodes of olr this week.
6195120	6199840	And I listened to the not last week's episode, but the one before that,
6200560	6204880	just a few days ago, I listened to the end of it. And somebody called into the show.
6206240	6218880	And somebody who shall remain Ranma and mentioned that a Dave and Buster's opened in his
6218880	6225360	locality. And all Rama's ass out tonight. I know he's at a convention. It's Memorial Day weekend.
6225360	6233280	He ain't here live to defend himself and he'd be long his ass out. Fight him. Get her get her
6233280	6242480	classic game stuff ready. Well, but anyway, he went ahead and mentioned that he, you know,
6242480	6249920	played a set after a very, very long hiatus. And that it didn't go quite as well as maybe he would
6249920	6256800	have hoped. And he suggested that perhaps there should be a new version of DDR for the over 40
6256800	6263760	crowd. That was made, you know, easier. To which I say you're about to rub it in that you did.
6266800	6272240	You're about to rub it in that you did max 300. Like a million. How many times was a million
6272240	6279200	times on your birthday? Well, something 42. But only half of those are on expert.
6280160	6286960	Which is the answer to life, the universe and everything. Yes, yes. But also my age. So as a
6286960	6294080	member of the over 40 club, who is currently working through the level 17 folder, I would
6294080	6303200	like to say I'm giving you a challenge. And by the way, anybody else who is in the over 40 crowd,
6303200	6309760	yourselves included, please feel free to sign on to this because I endorse that completely.
6312480	6318960	You have a Dave and Busters near you now. Get your butt out there. Get practice can't make me
6318960	6328000	get good. Right. And what I'm challenging you to do is by the end of this year,
6328880	6337120	play the following three songs all in one set. First stage, hyper twist, single expert,
6338320	6344080	absolute banger, one of my favorite songs in all of DDR forever. I'm sorry,
6344080	6348640	did you say absolute? I can do that one. Let's do absolute. No, no, no, no, no, no.
6350640	6357600	DDR joke people. I'm not gonna totally forget our old our old days. But yes, hyper twist is
6357600	6364080	rated a 15. And it isn't. It's not the hardest 15. It is it is it flows very well. It doesn't
6364080	6371600	have too much confusing stuff. It is awesome. Second stage. Romancing layer, single expert
6371600	6378160	rated a 14. And it used to be a 15. They actually re rated it down to a 14 because it's not that
6378160	6388640	hard. Very nice uplifting song by tag. Great. Final stage max 300 single expert 15. The big
6388640	6396560	bad max 300. You can do it. I couldn't do max 300 when I was 24. When the show started. What makes
6396560	6404800	you think I can do it now? Well, actually, well, you answer. First of all, the song is
6405840	6411680	20 years old at this point. You've heard it a million times probably, even though you're not
6411680	6419040	playing it, you're familiar enough with it, that you could practically drum it out already without
6419040	6427440	even touching the pad. And it's just a matter of muscle memory, practice, and you just have to get
6427440	6434560	into the right shape before it I will say it was not that that long ago that I did Orion seven,
6434560	6440400	eight civilization mix because you know, that was one of the first songs in a DDR game and I'm
6440400	6445680	getting I'm sorry, sorry to the non DDR followers on getting deep cuts. All right. But Orion seven,
6445680	6451280	eight civ mix was one of the first songs that had like a unique step chart where you had to
6451280	6455200	hear like you'd put it in tutorial mode where it claps with the notes and you would hear that
6455200	6465680	clapping in your head. Right. And then like that. Yeah. Yeah. Like you just like I still remember
6465680	6473200	to this day. What's that? Yeah. What a pain in the butt chart that was too. Yeah. So So just just to
6473200	6479840	give some context here for those that are watching on Twitch, this this is the note chart that Oh,
6479840	6484400	wow, that even the new DR still uses the old videos. That's great. This is the note chart that
6484960	6491760	why we are suggesting actually step mania, by the way. Oh, is it? Yeah. They use like a DDR skin.
6493200	6499200	We're all very familiar with this guy's videos. He's basically there on day two with, you know,
6499200	6508640	a YouTube chart of the video very reliable. But yes, it's a was once the hardest song in DDR,
6508640	6515360	not for very long, but it's still considered to be kind of a rite of passage to clear max 300 single
6515360	6522640	expert. That being said, they're, you know, teenagers or young adults who pick up the game now
6522640	6530800	and granted, it's a different time. The skill ceiling is so much higher now. Yeah, the
6531440	6538960	difficulty of the game is much higher now as far as how high it can go. And also, you know,
6538960	6545200	you can watch YouTube videos of expert players and learn their techniques and, you know, kind of
6545200	6550640	mimic what they do with their feet where, you know, we used to just stomp as hard as we could
6550640	6556240	and now like, folks are really minimizing movements. They're trying to stay in the center
6556240	6561280	and just kind of like, make subtle movements to hit everything and that way you don't use up all
6561280	6566800	your stamina very quickly. You can that's how you can get through these, you know, charts with 800
6566800	6578320	steps in them and still be standing afterwards. But but yeah, it's I've seen kids I'll call them
6578320	6582400	start playing this game now. And then six months later, they're already passing, you know,
6582400	6592480	17s and 18s. So if they can do that, then we can get up to level 15 in the next seven months.
6592480	6596560	Okay. But anyway, if Rama decides to take this challenge, which he should,
6597920	6602800	I will if he if he's serious about it, and he gets to the point where he wants,
6602800	6607920	he can get there. And you know, over the I anticipate, we will probably be able to finally
6607920	6615360	vaccinate any the summer. I will go to Dave and busters that day with him that he wants to
6616720	6621600	attempt it and I will play on the other side. Okay, so and I will join via facetime.
6623440	6628320	I can't promise I can come out there in person. But maybe someday I can come see it in person.
6628960	6631120	I'll stay in my pajamas and not move.
6632000	6637120	Now, and if he succeeds, I will I will top up his his Dave and busters card with
6638560	6641520	probably a good at least 20 bucks of credits there.
6641520	6645600	All right. I love that. Now, I was gonna say this why we are because I said I said,
6645600	6650560	I'm not sure I could I could do that anymore. But um, you know, and I've mentioned this on
6650560	6654960	social media, and I'm not trying to toot my own horn too much. However, I'm gonna toot it a little
6654960	6660160	bit. Oh, toot it. I absolutely toot it. I hit a pretty major landmark this week, I've lost 50
6660160	6665360	pounds since last year. So you know, that's awesome. And you know, I've talked about,
6665360	6671200	I was motivated by a diagnosis I didn't want, but it is what it is. And if it's going to have this
6671200	6676400	side effect, then I'll take it. And so at my highest, you know, which was July of last year,
6676400	6683200	I'm now down 50 pounds from that. And games have been a reason I can thank for that. Specifically,
6683200	6687120	you guys all know, I can't really say DDR, because I don't really live down the street
6687120	6690080	from a Dave and Buster's or anything like that. I don't go with the frequency I used to.
6690800	6697520	But I can say things like Pikmin Niantic, which really incentivizes walking,
6698480	6703040	Ingress, where I'm willing to walk an extra mile to go get a portal in the middle of nowhere,
6703040	6708000	just because it gets me moving and walking and all that stuff. Pokemon Go, sure, doing laps
6708000	6713680	around the Capitol, whatever, all of that, I absolutely say, yes, that's been a part of what's
6713680	6717520	helped me get through this and do this. So it's interesting how things have come full circle,
6717520	6722720	because I would say, you know, 20 years ago, when the show started, DDR was what was keeping me,
6722720	6727120	you know, relatively skinny. So it was I don't know if I call myself skinny, but you know,
6727120	6733520	anyway, it doesn't matter. So my point is, we're still waiting on this round one over in
6733520	6739520	Roseville to open up, which is supposed to be soon. I think I'm hearing June, but we've been
6739520	6744000	hearing all sorts of months we it was supposed to open in 2020. But we all know what happened.
6744800	6752000	So once that opens, Aaron, I will do this too. I'm not going to promise I could do your exact
6752000	6757760	setlist. But I'm going to do this. I'm going to at least get back to that nine footer I did before
6757760	6761440	if sieve mix is still on those machines, which I don't see why wouldn't it is it's kind of
6761600	6768080	reason is, I'll do that. Yeah, I believe it is. And we'll we'll start with that. And if I feel
6768080	6773520	pretty good, maybe I'll try to I'll try to get up to max 300. And then maybe start to explore your
6773520	6778560	setlist a little bit there. But it's going to be you know, because yeah, you look at a lot of these
6778560	6785600	youtubes you look at stuff and now it's it's other 24 year olds that were the age we were when we
6785600	6790000	started. And it's just like if I show up there and start busting out those moves, that's like
6790000	6794800	they're gonna be like, Who the fuck is this old man? And where did he learn to play this game?
6794800	6806240	And it's like, I was here first. I will say this, you know, at least at the location near me,
6806240	6813200	you know, new people come up all the time. So and of all ages, I actually one of the last times I
6813200	6819840	went before you know, this latest COVID wave started. There was a, you know, someone with
6819840	6825840	kids and mom, a mom and she got up on the other side with me, she wanted to try it out. So I took
6825840	6830800	it through her first set. And I love doing this because you know, I just I just love introducing
6830800	6837440	the game to new people. And she I usually you know, they do the tutorial and then she she
6837440	6841920	picked it up really quick. So I think we went straight to a two and she passed it and then a
6841920	6847520	three a four and I think we played a five on extra stage and she almost got through it all
6847520	6854320	the way without four misses. So she did pretty phenomenal for first time on there. And yeah,
6854320	6858720	you know what I use? You know what I used to do while we are and I should do this. Okay,
6858720	6863280	this is what this is what I'll do. Because I used to do when I would go play DDR in a new city where
6863280	6868640	people wouldn't know me. I would put in like I hadn't seen me before. I would put in the money
6868640	6874960	and I would play like for my first song, I'd play like an erotic song on the band. I would play
6874960	6878400	because you know, I love them. I would play like I'm basic, like, you know, a two footer or three
6878400	6883040	foot I play that and then I play and so people would be like, Oh, look at this guy playing.
6884240	6890960	And then for my last song, I bust out the hypnotic crisis, or the Orion seven, eight sieve mix,
6890960	6894880	or one of those like nine footers Afro Nova or something. I don't remember if that was a nine,
6894880	6898320	but I would bust out with those like way harder songs and just then just
6899120	6904240	blow through it and then just be like, and that was fun to do.
6906480	6908160	Wow, this game's really fun people.
6911360	6916640	Excellent. But yeah, if anyone is curious about this set, I'm actually going to stream because
6916640	6921440	tomorrow's the last day of the month. And also I don't have to work. So I'm probably going to do
6921760	6928240	a stream of DDR Grand Prix, probably around somewhere between one to 2pm Eastern, I'll start
6928800	6934720	and I'm going to play this set during my stream tomorrow. So I'll probably stream for about an
6934720	6942320	hour. And yeah, I'll clip it and probably link it on the discord so that everybody can get a look at
6942320	6948000	it. All right, please do. I love the challenge YYR. We'll see. We'll see what happens. Cross
6948000	6952400	your fingers that we get that stinking round one already because the the Dave and Buster's here not
6952400	6957680	very good. It's, it's the smallest one in the entire chain with that, with the exception of
6957680	6965280	Times Square is smaller. That's it. It's the Times Square one is not very big, but it's not supposed
6965280	6969440	to be. Yeah, of course, it's not going to be very big. They probably got to pay 10 times more in
6969440	6975520	rent than all the other locations. So but round one will be a game changer when that opens. So
6976480	6982000	all right, it's great. And you know what I will mention. So the new version Ace three is starting
6982000	6989760	to roll out. Currently it's on the gold cabs. But the peasants with all the other cabs have to wait
6989760	6996960	until I'm guessing July because that's what they did with Ace two Oh, when it came out. So probably
6996960	7005520	July and there's a lot of, you know, features of the game, things like extra stage, point two,
7005520	7013440	five and point seven, five speed mods, things that are locked out unless you play premium play,
7013440	7018080	which in Japan costs a little bit more and you have to pay with their funny money, Paselli.
7018080	7026080	Yeah. And up to this point, you know, because round one, all the round one locations have one
7026080	7031840	of these gold cabs running the Japanese version of DDR. But up until this point,
7031840	7037520	because it was a Japanese cab, you could not use the premium play mode because it required Paselli.
7038240	7045520	Starting with Ace three, they're allowing Japanese version cabs that are outside of Japan,
7045520	7051920	where Paselli is disabled to pay with premium play with coins. So for the first time ever,
7052560	7061840	uh, you can now actually get extra stage the unlocks. You can you can play the Dan courses,
7061840	7067680	the skill courses, which get progressively more difficult. You can finally do those things in
7067680	7076400	America. So on on a gold cab. So it'll be even better to have the round one when it does finally
7076400	7082240	open. All right. Well, I can't wait for that day to come. Why are Thank you so much for calling
7082240	7086480	in. And again, I encourage everyone I know you didn't come to shill your wares tonight,
7086480	7091200	but I'm going to do it for you. I would encourage everyone to check out falling plus just came out
7091200	7097840	on Xbox one. So check that out. Over it. You got to search for why we are games are falling plus,
7098720	7102880	or just you know, check out why we are games calm and all the latest stuff that you're working on
7103200	7107600	and all that good stuff. So yeah, support your support your neighborhood indie developer.
7109040	7114400	Thank you. All right. I look forward to Rama calling in next week to whine about this.
7114400	7117680	Sounds good. Let him let him be here to hear that.
7120400	7125600	All right. Take care. Now. Great to have you. All right. Bye. Have a great week. You too. Bye.
7126560	7131760	All right. Always good to hear from why we are here at orange launch radio. Let's check in with
7131760	7136080	Loki to see if there's any last minute stories tonight. Nope, there is nothing.
7136080	7139200	Wow, you're boring. I'm just kidding. I know. It's a slow news.
7140080	7144160	With Memorial Day and everything. It's you know, it's it's moving into the summer. It's that time
7144160	7148240	of year. So it is what it is. But things are gonna start to pick up. You know, we got state of play
7148240	7154720	next week. So it's good. It's quite before the storm. Yeah. Quickly, I'll let sj 100. Matt have
7154720	7160240	this question and then we'll wrap up sj 100. Matt says here's a question. Is there a gaming memory
7160240	7165440	out there that reminds you of summer? For example, a game that you played the hell out of over the
7165440	7173600	summer when school was out? Is rocker on roller skates? What on roller skates? Frogger Frogger
7173600	7179840	arcade machine. Oh, well, roller skates. Okay. Summer's going to the Babalu roller roller rink
7179840	7188800	in Dothan, Alabama. And the thing is, is that Bob, it was named after Bob and his wife. And Bob was
7188800	7195120	a friend of my granddaddy. So he saw always go and talk to Bob, and he'd give me like a dollar
7195120	7200800	in quarters. And I would play a few rounds of Frogger on roller skates into this day.
7200800	7204720	The only play I can really the only way I can really play Frogger well is on roller skates.
7206240	7211920	Um, I remember it roller king out in Roseville, where I grew up, I played Spy Hunter in roller
7211920	7220400	skates. But uh, but yeah, um, I don't, I don't know if that's not really a summer memory in
7220400	7224640	particular. I'm trying to think of a summer memory and I'm coming up short. I gotta be honest,
7224640	7228240	I can't think of anything I really like super associate with summer. I'm sure there are plenty
7228240	7232160	of video games when I was younger. But I would play video games every day. I wouldn't let the
7232160	7238480	school week stop me. I don't know. Loki, you have a summer memory? In recent and will not
7238960	7246880	not recent. I don't know, DDR, I guess. I don't really have anything that kinda I mean,
7249280	7253920	no, I didn't really have anything in particular that it would always change to me. It's whatever
7253920	7258240	games were out at the time, you know, go rent stuff at blockbuster or something like that.
7260160	7265040	Yeah, don't really have anything. All of mine just have to do with being in Dothan. So a lot
7265040	7273840	of SkyShark and uh, uh, Dr. Mario. I got one for an answer. Cause you know,
7273840	7279680	when I was very, very young, I played a lot of Commodore 64 and one game that I used to love
7279680	7284800	to play was summer games too. So they couldn't call it Olympics cause they didn't have that
7284800	7288560	license, but wink, wink, nudge, nudge. It was just an Olympic game and had all the same things.
7288560	7293360	And there was a summer games one, but we had summer games too. I think we got the summer
7293360	7297520	games one eventually, but summer games two was the one that I played a lot. And then there was
7297520	7302160	winter games, but that's not a summer game. So, um, yeah, I used to play the hell out of all
7302160	7309200	those games. So like epics and that actually led to, cause those games series led to world games
7309200	7313360	and California games. And I think people might know those because some of the, one of the
7313360	7318000	California games, I think it was on NES, um, as well as some other platforms. So that's like
7318000	7325040	summer and winter games with the predecessors to those games. So all right. Well, uh, with that,
7325040	7327920	we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up for the night.
7327920	7331440	But I do want to say thank you as always for listening to orange orange radio,
7331440	7335200	whether you were here tonight on a three day holiday weekend, uh, or if you were listening
7335200	7339840	on the podcast feed through one of your favorite podcast apps like Spotify, iTunes, wherever it is,
7339840	7344160	you listen to podcasts. Thank you for checking us out. Uh, if you enjoyed what you heard, tell
7344160	7347360	a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer
7347360	7352400	has a voice, but we need more voices here to put out on air. Uh, we're hitting 20 years old,
7352400	7357040	if you can believe it or not later, uh, next month. And, uh, we hope to see you here, um,
7357040	7363360	June 26th. Um, get off my lawn and give me some Jerry. That's right. That's right. Uh,
7363360	7367920	let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Uh, dark Sakura, what is your final thought
7367920	7372720	tonight? I'm actually kind of glad to be starting early cause then I can end early.
7373280	7378960	Mm hmm. Cause my ass is working tomorrow, but let's hear it for, for double and a half pay,
7378960	7385760	right? Hell yeah. For holiday pay. All right. Have a good night. Dark saga later taters later.
7386320	7390640	And a Loki, your final thought. I have a lot to do and not a lot of time to do it in
7391440	7394480	isn't that always the struggle. It is always the struggle.
7395040	7402240	Um, my final thought I'm very thankful for a day off tomorrow. Um, and I, I of course recall the
7402240	7406720	reasons for it. So, uh, I, I am mindful of that as well, but I'm thankful to just have a day of
7406720	7412560	rest, uh, tomorrow. Um, I actually, I don't really have a plan, which is kind of nice. I
7412560	7417120	didn't really want to travel. Um, I just kind of wanted to relax, especially after hosting a show
7417120	7421120	last night. I know whenever I do that, I'm putting myself a little more at risk for COVID. So I just
7421120	7426720	take it easy for a few days to make sure I'm doing okay. So, uh, yeah. So, um, I'm thankful for day
7426720	7431760	off and I am very thankful for the show. Hosting stuff has been going very well. We had a really
7431840	7437040	awesome show last night. It was a pride based cabaret. Um, and I always love when I get to
7437040	7442240	host celebrities like, uh, you know, I did John Waters a few months ago, but this week we had Sam
7442240	7448720	well, who is best known for his YouTube classic. What, what in the butt was performing at the show.
7449280	7454880	And I love hosting celebrities like that because they know exactly they, they, they don't think
7454880	7458720	they're anything bigger than what they are. You know what I mean? He's a very humble guy
7458720	7462000	and just there to have fun. And that's what I love about it. That's what it should be.
7462000	7466960	Does he have any other songs? He does. He did a whole little mini concert of like, um,
7466960	7470800	five songs or something like that. So, uh, but they're, they're all like,
7471760	7475520	Loki. I don't know if they're all like gays, they're all gay sex songs. I don't think you'd
7475520	7480960	necessarily be into them, but I will actually shocked. Our crowd was super into it. So what
7480960	7485440	was it like dirty, filthy boy or something like that as his latest single? Sorry, Sam. Well,
7485440	7488560	I butchered the name. I just couldn't remember in the moment, but yeah, so,
7488560	7493200	but they're, they're all, it could be in DDR. It's all like, that's, you know what? You cannot,
7493760	7498880	you cannot sit here and be like, I loved all those DDR songs back in the day and then think like,
7498880	7503040	Oh, but I'm too good for Sam. Well, no, no, no. Exactly.
7503040	7507280	Come on. We used to have, was it the alligator project songs in there?
7507280	7512320	Oh yeah. Blow my whistle, bitch. Come on. Come on. Is that, is that really any,
