00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,120
Video games are art, and like all art, they are all what you make of it. They're unique

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,620
for all other applications of art because you are a primary part of it. Alongside video

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,720
games live, play, and plenty more productions to BBC is getting into the game of orchestral

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,720
presentations of select music pieces, and I am pumped to see this. This is one art jumping

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,880
mediums and culture story. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,120
tell you more about this headline and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,800
show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,920
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:54,240
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:04,600
number 912 for our show for May the first. It is May 2022. I am Rob Roberts and joining me as he

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,840
does every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki.

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,360
Hello.

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,240
How are you doing?

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm doing better.

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,680
Good, good. I was gonna ask you were out last week because you had your surgery. So you're here.

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,200
You're looking normal. You're upbeat. So good. We were all hoping it would go this way where you

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
just you're gonna just go right back into doing the show and all that stuff. But everything's

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,480
going well.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Yeah, it's going well. I took a week watch it. I have a few more days off still. Because they're

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:39,480
finishing up the last piece of I guess the recovery where they have to take out the stent that they

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,600
put in. So that's tomorrow. So looking forward to that.

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,640
Let's

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,760
take a moment to reflect on the fact that getting old sucks.

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,640
Yes. And I like it too. Like because because you know, the whole kidney stone thing they said, you

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,160
know, it's a calcium, they have the different calcium since most of them are calcium. But it's

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,560
like, like, you can get it from having too little calcium or too much calcium. It's like, okay,

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,400
the whole amount of calcium. Exactly. How am I supposed to know? You know, how much calcium I

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,800
should have? And my wife always says that it's, you drink too much milk. I'm like, I hardly drink

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,040
any milk at all. I occasionally maybe once or twice a week, I have a bowl of cereal. And that's

30
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,920
it. Like that is hardly drinking too much milk. When I was a kid, I drank milk all the damn time.

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,480
So like, this is nothing. Like I, I don't know. It could be a lot of you're not a coffee person.

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,000
Like I drink like literally having iced coffee with it's not fat milk, but it's milk in it right

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,440
now. So yeah, I don't normally drink coffee. I have I've been, you know, drinking some more of

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,200
the Red Bulls recently. But not even that much like maybe once a week. And it's only because

35
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,760
I've had like a bag of these Red Bulls that I've had since last year sitting underneath my desk

36
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,720
here that I wanted to drink them before they expired. So I've been just going through those

37
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,760
slowly. But I've had like maybe five Red Bulls in the 2022 so far. So it's like, hardly nothing.

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,880
And she's like, Well, it's because you drink too much of those too. I honestly don't think so. I

39
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,720
mean, like one a day is not that bad. I wouldn't want it should not be a big deal. Let's talk video

40
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,960
games. What is that playing by? I think that I think I caught the title screen earlier. So playing

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,240
behind you because we are broadcasting live at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash a VOG network

42
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,880
where we do broadcast live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,520
after the Bobby Black Wolf show and sometimes you get some we know it's a podcast we try to be very

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,160
aware and not rely too heavily on video. But I sometimes Loki will run video behind him actually

45
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,680
he always because we don't want to see my kitchen No, but um, you've got the Stanley parable, right?

46
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,680
But this is this the new one that like the or whatever, like the ultra deluxe 10 years later,

47
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,200
they've revisited it. That's pretty cool, though. Yeah, yeah, I like that. I get to play it. I need

48
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,080
to ask that if you played it yet, but you know, you're just watching YouTubers run through it.

49
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,240
Yeah, it's interesting how a lot of people will do games that way in this day and age, huh?

50
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,360
Well, I liked it. And I still will pick it up. I just haven't done it yet. I mean, I probably do

51
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,760
it now. I'm not joining us tonight. I need to mention dark soccer or Jamie Summers. You haven't

52
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,560
heard her yet because she's not here tonight. Usually I don't really get into the reasons like

53
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,560
if people take a night off or whatever, like I that's that's y'all's business. Unless you know,

54
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,320
people don't care and they want to they want to say what's going on. For example, Loki disclosed

55
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,400
his surgery on an earlier episode of the show. Dark soccer was very open about our trip to

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,320
Disneyland. And she has mentioned this on Twitter. And I think I think this is worth just talking

57
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,960
about and mentioning real quick. So I want to go to Twitter real quick here. The dark soccer put a

58
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,800
tweet up that said I'm not feeling very well tonight. So taking the night off olr and my

59
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,680
stream to rest and tend to my own mental health. Thank you all for understanding. And then some

60
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,840
nice words about Bobby and us. And you know, yeah, we don't, we don't often talk a lot about doing

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:25,040
stuff for your mental health. And, you know, especially when it comes to podcasting, streaming,

62
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,480
things of that sort. It can people oftentimes underestimate the toll that this type of stuff

63
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,520
can have on your mental health. Is that and that's why I've been like, personally,

64
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,520
even though I do streaming on the side, not just olr, but on my own personal channel,

65
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,920
I've sometimes personally resisted wanting to publish a schedule that like, I'm going to be

66
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,120
live on certain such and such day. And that's I realized like 95% of streamers do that. And that's

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,000
no shade or nothing. I'm just saying for me, like I, I have had all the time, these things where I'm

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,960
like, I'm going to stream tonight. And then when tonight comes around, I'm like, maybe I'm not,

69
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,800
cause I'm not really feeling extroverted tonight. I just kind of want to be a vegetable and play some

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,440
dead by daylight on my own terms. And that's going to be that. But then other times I'm like, yeah,

71
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,800
heck yeah, I'm going to get on stream and do that and do it. And I just kind of like to do that sort

72
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,680
of thing on my own schedule. So don't ever like force yourself or push yourself if you're not

73
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,120
like feeling it or whatever. If you like, if that sort of thing is going to be counterproductive to

74
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,920
your mental health, because we don't often talk about that type of stuff enough. And it's

75
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,480
important. You've got to take your time for your mental health and be in a good place like that,

76
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:45,200
or else you're just going to make the problem worse by, by doing podcasts, broadcasting,

77
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,960
twitching, whatever it is that's out there. And I see a lot of love in our chat room over

78
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,680
twitch.tv slash vog network. Pod culture saying a fucking man quest buster says streamers big

79
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,640
and small take breaks too, because human fifth dream says that is literally my entire life.

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,040
I never know from one minute to the next. If I feel like doing a thing physically or mentally

81
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,080
SSU 100, Matt says yourself is the most important thing. Take care of you first before worrying

82
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,520
about others needs. Very well said. Yeah, I can probably elaborate more. It's not even

83
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,720
just streamer stuff, but like YouTube in general to you can get burnt out creator culture. Yeah.

84
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,520
My gaming week, we'll talk about burnout. All right. The stuff that I did. Are you

85
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,760
have you finally had your fill of Minecraft? No, I haven't. I've had fill my fill of a certain

86
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:42,560
type of gameplay in Minecraft. Because I had a project this week that I built that was extremely

87
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,560
large. It took three weeks to put together. And I was just fed up with doing it. And it came out

88
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,360
really good. I saw the video because you posted it over in our Discord server, which you know,

89
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,040
of course, vog network.com slash discord. And if you aren't already subscribed to Loki on YouTube,

90
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,600
you should fix that. He's Loki o lr on YouTube. Very easy to find. And yeah, so I will get into

91
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,320
the video in a little bit in our gaming weeks that you don't eat of all your gaming week here. But

92
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,080
yeah, it looked very impressive what you were doing in that game. But you also have a lot of

93
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,640
patience to be doing something like that. That's for sure. But then I think he's been very bored

94
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,440
this last week. It wasn't boring at all. Because like I it was basically like, yeah,

95
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,960
the recovery from surgery is basically you couldn't, you couldn't really do like be active.

96
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,800
So I mean, I was on my computer, which is like, that's normal anyways. So it was,

97
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,400
it was instead of working at, you know, eight to five, or nine to five job or whatever.

98
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,640
I was doing Minecraft during that time. And during the time when I normally did so it's

99
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,600
like solid Minecraft, like, well, 14 hour days for like a week and a half just building one thing.

100
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,080
And that was just, I was getting tired by the end.

101
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,320
Bobby Black Wolf in chat, I want to go back to the topic we were just discussing discussing

102
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,240
about the mental health because there's more great comments in chat. And I want to read them.

103
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,280
Bobby Black Wolf says, especially since content creators are basically gig workers, and have to

104
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,880
pay for their own health insurance. So they feel like they can't take time off. There's no PTO for

105
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,840
a full time streamer. That's a huge point. We have a story coming up later on. And I'm sure many of

106
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,600
you have heard about this that's going on. And that is the talk about Twitch changing potentially

107
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,960
some of the rates and the payouts for partners to try to stay profitable. And, you know, that has

108
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,520
this huge impact. It's it's this incredibly uncharted territory, this whole making a living

109
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,560
off being a streamer. And it's, it's it's dangerous. It's risky. And that alone is a can

110
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,480
do a lot on mental health. Because as this news is showing this week, Twitch, Amazon can pull the rug

111
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,160
like that. And there isn't shit you can do about it, quite frankly. Unless Yeah, that's why folks

112
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,040
diversify. I mean, diversify your revenue streams, unless everybody, you know, groups up and does

113
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,960
something together. But yeah, yeah, diversify your revenue streams as very important. Yeah,

114
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,240
because like, even with YouTube, like you don't know, like, if there's gonna be another

115
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,320
apocalypse saying YouTube's algorithms and stuff, it's screwy. They could get content claimed for

116
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,040
nothing. Like it could be your own original content, but someone's trolling it or their

117
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,040
algorithm will decide one day they're going to delete your channel or who knows, like, so you

118
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:39,440
have to just do merchandise, Patreon, Twitch subscriptions, whatever you can do. Yeah, donations.

119
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,320
Yeah, you know, fog network, we're probably missing out not upping our YouTube presence. We

120
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,080
have a YouTube channel. And there's some good stuff on there. But we're not doing a lot of stuff

121
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,560
regularly. I have ideas. But you know, there's always ideas. There's just the time to put ideas

122
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,680
and emotion which isn't always plentiful. So anyway, I want to get some other comments here.

123
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,760
Pod culture says it's been a couple years and I'm just now feeling the itch to really start

124
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:12,240
podcasting again. It makes sense. Mike deaf says imposter syndrome is definitely not a joke. That

125
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,280
is so true. And I deal with that a lot a lot more than you guys probably think. From you know,

126
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,600
having listened to this show, as long as y'all have even if this is your first week, you know,

127
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,920
this show has been around for coming up on 20 years now. I deal with imposter syndrome all the

128
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,920
time. I deal with it in my professional life. I deal with it in what I do here. The first time I

129
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,720
did panels at Dragon Con, the first time I did a huge panel at Dragon Con, I dealt with it. I

130
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,160
dealt with it deal with it with a lot of the hosting that I do on the weekends. And some of

131
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,000
the big you know, I I've talked about some of the big names for me. Getting to host like doing the

132
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,120
Twin Peaks panel and stuff that was huge on imposter syndrome for me where I'm like,

133
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,560
there, you know, you're just you're going up there and it's like they're they're gonna know

134
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,600
that you're just a fan who rests the stage. You have no business being up here amongst all these

135
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,960
like actual talented people. And it's it's, it's a real thing. And that absolutely plays into Twitch

136
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:18,480
when sometimes people think nobody's gonna watch my stream, who cares about my stream and my thing.

137
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,600
And that's why I kind of like urge people. Don't. Nobody is going to watch your stream in the

138
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,560
beginning. Most likely you may have one or two people, your friends and stuff, but it takes a

139
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,800
long time and a lot of being regular and really immersing yourself in Twitch culture and networking

140
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,040
and making friends to grow on this platform. And it takes a long time and a lot of investment.

141
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,800
This isn't just something that happens overnight. And it's, it's a pretty big deal. And look,

142
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,160
I see you talking to chat about, you know, growing on YouTube and it's taken you a long time

143
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
just to grow a little bit. And you're still, are you at the monetized level yet?

144
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,320
No, not even close. You're still a lot bigger than you were two years ago.

145
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,240
Yes. And like two years ago, I think I was at a hundred and something. I think I can't remember

146
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,200
what I was like earlier this year, but I think it was like 200 something, like not that long ago.

147
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,640
And I'm up to 350. I've been getting, like, it said about 30 subscribers a month now,

148
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,920
which is pretty nice. It's because I'm kind of changing up my content a little bit and people

149
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,280
are starting to notice. And then you'd be surprised. There's a lot of people that don't

150
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,920
know like who you are, but then they'll find you like, how do you not have more subscribers

151
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,680
or like your content's really good. I don't understand comments on your YouTube. I've seen

152
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,360
them. Yeah. Yeah. It's just like, it's nice to hear honestly. Ironically, though, sometimes,

153
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,640
like the people that say that don't subscribe to your channel, they're like, I don't understand

154
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,480
how you have more subscribers, but that's also, it's hard to say too, because like,

155
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,600
I go to my like YouTube studio dashboard or whatever, and I can't always see who's

156
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,720
subscribing on my channel. I can only see if they share that or something, which is really stupid,

157
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,480
but like, I can't like, and I wish I could see who is subscribed, because then I would call them

158
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,280
out and like say, Hey, thank you, or do something to like, kind of promote that, but I can't,

159
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,120
I can only see if they share it. And so yeah, it's pretty nice. We also just got shouted out on

160
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,560
another like Minecraft kind of compilation channel as well. So that was thanks to my other creator

161
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,000
that's on our server that was sending them tips and stuff. So he got us notice. And that was kind

162
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,600
of nice. And then you know, there'll be the the new server that I'll be participating with later

163
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,960
this summer, which that should really help expand things as well. They're certainly more organized.

164
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:47,360
And we had a group meeting, they do they do monthly meetings, which is great. So we had a

165
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,360
meeting just yesterday, actually, and that was pretty cool to kind of get to talk to them a

166
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,680
little bit longer and stuff. So I'm hoping all that will help me grow. Really, I'm only trying

167
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,720
to get to right now is 500, which means I can use the community features, which includes like,

168
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,480
posting non video updates, and doing like community polls and stuff like that.

169
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,520
I don't know why the gate that behind 500. It's so stupid, but whatever, you know, it's fine.

170
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,320
We'll do that. And then yeah, someday I'll get to 1000. Then I'll get like, my pennies rolling in.

171
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,920
Getting some other comments in chat. Bobby Blackwell says it's a huge commitment to get

172
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,840
monetized on YouTube. Well, I'll tell you, it definitely doesn't get you monetized. It's doing

173
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:37,280
nothing, right? You gotta, you gotta try, try, try, try again. Let's see. Quest Buster says a

174
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,520
streamer I tuned into from time to time branch to YouTube, and I've been doing that for a few years

175
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,280
only recently near the beginning of the year, one of their videos finally popped off. And it just

176
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,000
led to more of their stuff being seen. And I think this is very important for us, Joe and under Matt,

177
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,720
who says, always remember, though, that always support folks who are struggling. Jamie is getting

178
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,720
a lot of support right now because we're an awesome community. True. Some streamers don't

179
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,840
always have a close knit community like that. Yes, we've had 2020 years to build this essentially.

180
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,880
Sometimes the hurt people feel isn't obvious. So the moral should always be be cool, be nice and

181
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,760
understanding with folks. You never know what the person is going through. Absolutely. Um,

182
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,880
there was a moment on this show, God, it was probably like 12 years ago at this point,

183
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,840
but every the folks that have been here a long time know this very well. And that was when I had

184
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,480
my diva fit live on air, right. And you definitely remember this Loki, it was when we were in the

185
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,400
garage when I was living with Johnny. And I somebody in like, everything was going wrong

186
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,440
with the show, there was a tech issue, something was going on. And somebody said something in chat.

187
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,480
And I don't even at this point, I don't even exactly remember the comment. But it was something

188
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,240
about like, you know, just another thing breaking down or something like that. And even though the

189
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,480
person probably wasn't meaning to get out of my skin wasn't trying to get under my skin. Like,

190
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,680
I just snapped. And I was just like, well, then fuck it. And fuck this show, basically.

191
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,400
And I stormed off the set, literally stormed off the set. And Loki being the consummate professional

192
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,360
he is, was like, All right, well, let's go to the next story. And finally, this is student news.

193
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:21,280
I think he Yeah, exactly. And yeah, so you know what, it happens. You never know. And I'm not

194
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,880
saying you know, and again, I don't blame that individual. I don't even think this is the show

195
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,400
anymore. But even if they did, I don't blame that individual. It just sometimes these things happen.

196
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,800
And sometimes the chat comments and stuff, you never know what impact they're going to have.

197
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,320
And yeah, Matt says there was actually something more recently, of course, just a few weeks ago,

198
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,240
when you stopped the show, Rob, I saw you were done. And I saw you just needed to stop for

199
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,600
yourself. Yes, when the tech issues were like, literally mentally. So for the podcast, folks,

200
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,080
you didn't see any of this, because I just didn't put out a show that week. But the live folks here

201
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,480
on Twitch, we started to do a show. And there wasn't usually even if there's only a partial

202
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,840
show, I'll put it out on the feed anyway. But we really only did like 20 minutes. And the tech

203
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:09,360
issues were just too overwhelming. And I got to a point where I was like, I'm I'm not dealing with

204
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,800
these tech issues anymore. I'm done. And of course, you know what, given give it seven days,

205
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,560
turn it off, and then on again, everything worked magically the next week. And now my phone speaking

206
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,440
of tech issues, my phone thinks I'm yelling at it. But anyway, yeah, I mean, it just sometimes

207
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,920
you just have to step away. And that's exactly what that moment was, was just a whole, I'm

208
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:36,640
overwhelmed. This is too much. If I don't step away, I'm gonna have another fit. So this time,

209
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:45,760
I knew to stop it anyway. All right. Plenty plenty of meta stuff. Let's get into some news

210
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,480
for the week going around in the gaming world. We're gonna start off tonight with this story,

211
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,080
which is, this is something else. You know, I think a lot of people heard the story of Balan

212
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,960
Wonderland, or maybe you pre ordered it and you actually bought it and you played it. And maybe

213
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,000
you still enjoyed it. I realized this game has its fans and its apologizers. And that's fine. You

214
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,400
like what you like and go off. But I think we can all kind of see that the community as a whole

215
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,400
rejected this game. It didn't sell as much as it should have, considering it was by the creator

216
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,480
of Sonic and for a Square Enix game. And for the most part, it flopped. And people just kind of

217
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,320
wrote it off as, well, man, Yuji Naka, I guess just couldn't make another good game. That's

218
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,800
too bad. You know, we've all written it off. But now there's a very interesting layer,

219
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,920
layer, la y er, there's another whole new interesting layer that's shown up with this.

220
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,800
Interesting to that actually, now I just stopped me to think this is very interesting coming after

221
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:49,120
that whole discussion on assuming what a streamer is going through. Well, how about a game developer?

222
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:57,600
Because yeah, this is very interesting. So Yuji Naka went to Twitter to vent about what happened

223
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,920
with Balamb Wonderworld. He said he was removed as the game's director six months before launch,

224
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,280
and the developer Arzest submitted a final build of the game that wasn't final and it had bugs in

225
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,640
it. Yuji Naka also on Twitter claimed that one of the songs in the game was going to be reworked

226
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,320
for promotional purposes, and not using the track that was straight from the game. Yuji Naka said

227
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,960
that game creators should be able to improve their games until the very end, when he requests to

228
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,360
address issues, and when his requests to address these issues were ignored, he decided to sue

229
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,040
Square Enix. Yuji Naka says if he was kept on as the head of the project, it would have never

230
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,160
released in an unfinished state, and he found that seeing Balamb Wonderworld release in an

231
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,560
unfinished state was a true disgrace. There's a lot of comments that are on Twitter. It's a

232
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:53,280
little much for me to read, but let me try to get some highlights here. He talked about Sonic.

233
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,800
For example, in Sonic the Hedgehog, two weeks before going gold, we changed the mechanics,

234
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,880
where if you had even a single ring, you would not die. Even up until the very end, we were trying to

235
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,480
improve the game, and I hope that everyone is still enjoying those games today, and I think

236
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:16,640
everybody knows that mechanic in Sonic the Hedgehog, and that's important, right? He also

237
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,080
says the business relationship with Arzest fell apart due to my comments about Arzest submitting

238
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,040
the final build without fixing bugs, even though there were problems during development, and I was

239
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,960
pushing for further polish. Oshima spoke to the producer Fujimoto about this. Oshima wrote in an

240
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,840
emailed Fujimoto saying, I gathered the development staff and informed them about pushing back the

241
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,120
trial phase of development. This decision was made by producer Fujimoto. Let's do our best for Mr.

242
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,480
Fujimoto. The staff applauded and cheered. This was wholly unexpected, and we were very touched.

243
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,880
The staff who had recently been rather dejected were in an instant revitalized. Thank you very

244
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,440
much. The entire staff will do our best. Yujinaka said, I don't have anything to do with the

245
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,520
development timeline because that is created by the producer, not me, the director. Such tight

246
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,440
deadlines are decided by the producer. Something didn't seem quite right. Personally, I believe

247
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,480
that it is a true disgrace that Balowonder World was released in the state that it was in.

248
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,360
I wanted to show the world an action game in its proper light. Therefore, I believe that Square

249
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:25,440
Enix and RZest are companies that care about neither games nor their fans. Yep. That's a huge

250
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,760
dagger to throw at Square Enix, which is, you know, with especially such a large company where,

251
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,320
you know, this is the same company that has huge fans and people that feel much differently when

252
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,880
it comes to things like Final Fantasy 14, or I suppose the Final Fantasy series in general.

253
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,920
Um, what are your thoughts hearing all this, Loki? What did you think when you heard about this?

254
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:54,160
It's unfortunate because like I kind of, I did kind of blame Yujinaka for like how bad this

255
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,200
turned out originally because you kind of look at it like almost like a Mighty No. 9 type of

256
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,760
scenario where it's like, oh, you know, you think you're going to, you know, make this great Megaman

257
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,200
clone or something like that. And it ends up turning out to be garbage. And it's like, well,

258
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
maybe you just couldn't do that. And it's like, oh, maybe this is another Mighty No. 9 again.

259
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
But we got to remember now that there's also publishers that make really dumb decisions

260
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,600
constantly. Right. And Square Enix is one to do that, to cut corners to, you know,

261
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,320
on some other products like Final Fantasy 14, it's very well put together and stuff. But

262
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,880
I think there's different projects have different levels of upper management kind of oversight on,

263
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,160
whereas like, you know, some of these remasters of the older Final Fantasy games that kind of

264
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,760
get kind of rushed out and look kind of like garbage. And there's like weird bugs and stuff

265
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,280
in them. Like, I think that kind of stuff is kind of, you know, what's the blame here? I wouldn't be

266
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,760
surprised if Arzest got like some sort or maybe management, Arzest got some sort of bonus for

267
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,800
being able to publish the game when they could. So they'd rather release it with bugs, get that

268
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:08,560
kickback rather than put out a good product. Who knows? Some comments from chat. E3VL says,

269
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,080
worst game of last year for me. Mike Def says, I think Naka is in the right, but also the game was

270
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,520
beyond saving from its development history. Sacred Jade says, I believe Naka-san, Square Enix hasn't

271
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,400
been the best in the last few years. Questbuster says, I agree. The game was in development since

272
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,680
2018 and a lot of core mechanics have had to have been baked in by the time he was dismissed

273
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,160
that the rest of the game had to be built around. Six months isn't really a lot of time to put in

274
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:41,520
heavy redesign. Yeah. And here's the thing. If he was the producer, though, or, you know, whoever

275
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,400
that was, you know, approving timelines and stuff, you know, maybe if he thought he couldn't get it

276
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,200
done in time, then they would push it back. I mean, I don't know. Well, and that's, and that's

277
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,560
the thing. I do think this story is fascinating. And I do think, you know, it should make us all

278
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:02,080
think differently about how did a flop become a flop? Did these people set out to make a flop?

279
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:10,160
No. But did all of their visions on how to get it done get aligned? Clearly not. But, and so I think

280
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,560
there's definitely something to be said here about maybe how fast some of us were to, you know, kind

281
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,280
of say, oh, Yuji Naka made a flop when maybe he really was behind the scenes trying to push back

282
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,280
on some of that. However, all that being said, I will say, I think Yuji Naka did make a key mistake,

283
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,400
a critical mistake. And it's that part in his thing where he talks about the Sonic the hedgehog

284
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,480
and changing that up to, you know, two weeks before the game was released. Sir, you're not

285
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,600
making games to the Sega Genesis anymore. Games don't work the same way that they did

286
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,040
literally 30 years ago at this point. And so, you know, if you want to go all the way back to the

287
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:57,680
days of the Atari 2600, those games were made by one person. And then when you get into the NES

288
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,640
era, some of the hell some of those games were made by one person. Like you look at balloon fight,

289
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,520
you know, as you know, Satoru Iwata is, you know, one of his, you know, biggest, well known games,

290
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,760
or small teams, if you will, when you get in the NES era, and then getting into the Sega Genesis

291
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,240
still, it was more smaller teams. That's not how games are made anymore. Not a Square Enix

292
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,200
production, right? But like, it's not necessarily I mean, it's still I think, a good example,

293
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,520
though, like just changing game mechanics, but should you really be changing game mechanics two

294
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,600
weeks, you know, right from launch? I mean, I get it. Like, I don't know what he's changing it from,

295
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,520
like, if there's like, oh, you have to have 50 rings in or not to die or something like that.

296
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,720
I don't know what it was before where they decided to drop it down. But that's,

297
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,440
that's like tweaking a value. It's like, okay, well, this boss is going to do 10 damage points

298
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,800
instead of two damage points or something like that. Like that's just like small tweaks. That's

299
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,160
what that's what you do. Like in the part of the whole gameplay testing and balancing phase of

300
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,360
like game development. It doesn't matter the size of the team. But that, right. That's just an

301
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,320
example of like, we constantly work towards making the game better up until launch, right? That that's

302
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,880
what development teams are supposed to do. You don't just go, okay, time to kick back. You know,

303
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,600
it's like, right, you're trying to smash, you know, bugs and stuff like that. But like,

304
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,560
but certain things sounded like there's a lot six months beforehand. They weren't. That's why,

305
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,920
you know, ultimate. So again, this is, I think mistakes were made all around. I don't think

306
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Square Enix Square Enix is certainly not blameless in this scenario. No, I'm not sure

307
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:34,000
Yuji Naka is 100% the good guy. I think he made mistakes too. And the one thing, you know, I'm not

308
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,360
seeing a lot of that in here. And this discussion for the lawsuit is, you know, what, what did he

309
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,480
learn about himself from this experience? So that's just, that's just something I just kind

310
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:52,560
of notice. So anyway, I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network as the two 100 Matt

311
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,600
says, seems like there were F your visions. We got to get this game out now because we're invested

312
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,360
too much and need to get a return here. As to 100 Matt says six weeks out, your QA testing should be

313
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,440
done not changing mechanics. Last week, we talked about Xenoblade Chronicles three and how it's

314
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,080
coming out early now. You know how a game comes out early? A lot of planning and getting a lot of

315
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:25,280
shit locked in well before two weeks before or just releasing it early and hoping for the best

316
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,680
and then putting out a roadmap later on seeing that like, here's how we're going to fix it.

317
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,640
Here's our roadmap and our roadmap of a roadmap. Yeah, so there's two options there. The good and

318
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,200
the evil.

319
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,200
questbuster says huge respect for Naka and his place in gaming history. No one will take that

320
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,320
away. Yes, I agree. But he's still human like everyone else. Absolutely. Right? Exactly.

321
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,080
As like, you know, for example, Mighty number nine, you know, that that's another perfect

322
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,160
example. Like it on paper, that should have been a really fun like Mega Man type game.

323
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,520
It wasn't. On the other hand, then we also have was that that bloodstain rituals of the night or

324
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:15,200
whatever. Whereas that is a good like Castlevania like game. So some people can do it. Some people

325
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,720
try to do it and they it you know, they can't. It's not as easy as you know, just being a certain

326
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,760
role on a team. You know, it's you're running this company and doing all this other stuff like,

327
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,280
like my number nine had a lot of stuff that was like wrong with it. Like,

328
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,800
when they are start pitching a whole nother game on top of it, like a new Mega Man Legends type

329
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:42,720
thing. And like animated series and all this stuff. It's like, okay, cool. Let's focus back

330
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,880
on that game that you need to work on, you know, not just all these other projects down the road

331
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,800
like it. Yeah, it's just you have to have the right talents to be able to do just the game

332
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,400
development part and then all the other publishing and stuff parts as well. Because if you don't,

333
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
then it'll fall apart even if you are a talented developer.

334
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,480
I'm hoping I'm pronouncing this right. I'm sorry if I'm not in chat. Godets in chat says it's

335
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,240
interesting. I've played a lot of teamfight tactics and League of Legends over the years.

336
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,800
So I'm pretty used to constant changes to my game. But those are free to play models. Yeah,

337
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,520
exactly. It's not something where, you know, they're taking pre orders, getting your money up

338
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,080
front, you know, to deliver a game on a certain date. I think usually the vision of those free

339
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,560
to play games is usually it's it's that, you know, they're going to grow their subscribers over time.

340
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:36,240
That's what success looks like to a free to play game. It is very rare. You have a game like

341
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,480
Pokemon Go, that has gazillions of players out the gate. That's not the model of success. And

342
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,280
that's not even when this has been discussed many times. That's not what Niantic was expecting

343
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,960
either. Is that game be huge at the gate. It's all about growing your base with those games.

344
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,920
It is a much different model to approach anyway. But yeah, Yuji Naka, he's human. It'll be

345
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,760
interesting to see how this plays out in the coming months. But it definitely puts a whole

346
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,200
other spin on this conversation. Anyway, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the

347
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,960
types of video games that we have been playing this week. Loki, you were talking a little bit

348
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,960
about it. But how was your recovery gaming week? My gaming week was all Minecraft because I had a

349
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,480
large project that I decided to do. So in my S&P series on nerdcraft, I've been working on this

350
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,200
whole steampunk, you know, build. And so part of that is going to be building a city, you know,

351
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,040
a steampunk city or something. So I was trying to terraform everything to make the land kind of,

352
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:44,880
usable to build buildings on it. And I realized it was just really flat and boring. And so like

353
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,160
my other folks, since we have it like broken up with different factions, so they have like the

354
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:57,040
folks that are building mountains, and one doing like gothic architecture. And then I think

355
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,680
somebody else was doing something. But the mountain stuff looked really cool. And I was like,

356
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:07,680
well, it'd be cool to build like a mountain. And then my project got over scoped to hell. So like,

357
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:14,240
it took forever to clear out the land that was in there. Then I ended up going into a creative test

358
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,680
world, designing a mountain, basing it off of like some of the block pallets and stuff in this mod

359
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Terralith, which has these really, Terralith is awesome. It has like a really beautiful landscape

360
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:34,960
and everything in all these different mountains and just amazing landscapes. So I based it off

361
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,000
of that. And then I decided because I'm a perfectionist, I need to put real Minecraft

362
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:48,080
caves inside these mountains. So I also grabbed some of those out of my world and kind of

363
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,760
build the schematics around all that stuff. So after I had all that done, and then I because

364
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,720
originally the schematic was like 4 million blocks, I was like, nope, not doing that because

365
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,200
it was solid. So I hollowed it out, which took forever. And then once I had it all hollowed out,

366
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,360
it had the schematic in place, I needed to gather about 90,000 blocks to start building. And that's

367
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:19,040
90,000 outside of like the actual smoothing of the landscape to match the land around it. So

368
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,480
the landscape smoothing itself also took about another, I think it was like 120,000. I don't

369
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,520
know, it ended up being roughly just over 200,000 blocks at the place or remove or it was a lot. So

370
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,000
that took several weeks just to design it. And then once I got it took like a week or something

371
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,720
to clear out the space, and then to actually build everything took like a week and a half to two

372
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,520
weeks. And when I say a week and a half to two weeks, I'm not talking about like, after work each

373
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:57,280
day, it was during my recovery time, I was putting in 12 to 14 hour days playing Minecraft,

374
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:04,160
doing this stuff. So it's it was a massive project, like massive, massive project.

375
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,040
So I'm showing the video for the Twitch people. And for the folks on the podcast, of course,

376
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,640
you can see it too. And I would urge you to go check it out over at Loki o lr on YouTube.

377
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,120
But this this mountain, we're looking at a Minecraft, you built that? Yep, one brick

378
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:26,560
at a time. Yep, one one block at a time. It's hollow. So it's, it's, it, it, you know, it's

379
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,480
a lot less material. So yeah, but yeah, the time lapse on that video is great. I the music and

380
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,560
everything. It turned out really well. But yeah, there's actual keys in there. In fact, I think I

381
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,440
actually a little bit later in the clip here, I end up like going into one of the caves that kind

382
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:49,360
of show it off. But yeah, we can just yeah, it's there you are in the cave. Yeah, there's one of

383
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,320
the caves that I was in. So like it actually has caves and I lit up everything so that mobs will

384
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,840
spawn in there. But yeah, that was like when I watch your videos, I'm so inspired to play

385
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:08,000
Minecraft. And then I do play Minecraft. And then I remember how fucking bad I am at it that like,

386
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,240
I need to not play survival mode. That's the thing.

387
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,840
Play survival. There's a lot of stuff that they've changed nowadays. It makes it a lot easier

388
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,520
like lighting up stuff. Like monsters don't come out unless there's light level zero. So you can

389
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,760
put fewer torches and stuff. Here's what I didn't finish the story. Here's what really happens Loki

390
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,120
and they'll start playing Minecraft. I'm like, this is too hard. And I'll be like, I'll go play

391
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,720
No Man's Sky because that's like Minecraft enough. Yeah, that's that's what ends up happening.

392
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,800
Anyway, check out check out that video over at YouTube Loki o lr. Of course,

393
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,760
so I don't want to show the whole thing. But I had to share. That's fine.

394
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,640
But yeah, it's so it was a massive project. And it was my fault for making it too because like,

395
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,200
I started off in the mountain wasn't that big. And I was like, it doesn't look that great.

396
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,960
And so it just kept getting bigger. And then it kept getting more elaborate. And it was just

397
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,080
what I should have done is broke it up for multiple videos. But I just didn't,

398
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,920
I just wanted to finish it. And so I did it on one and it's really way too much for one video.

399
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,880
It was and then fortunately, like I looked at the time like the last video I'd released before that

400
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,720
was my April Fool's video, which was on April 9. And this is like almost three weeks later. So it

401
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:31,520
I try not to space that out that much because I want to make sure that I have, you know,

402
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,640
my content in there. I try to get stuff out at least every week or two weeks. I did put a

403
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,600
hardcore one in between those but it's just you know, it turned out really well. Now I can just

404
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:50,000
go focus on buildings and stuff and not actually doing more landscape stuff. I'll do some landscape

405
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,880
stuff, but it's gonna be a lot less big like this. But it just, yeah, it turned out really

406
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,560
well. So hopefully it gets noticed. Because, yeah, it took a lot of time.

407
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,160
My gaming week, a lot of the same stuff for me as well. A lot of Final Fantasy 14,

408
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,880
I was streaming that I've been leveling Sage in that game. So I'm, I think I've got Sage up to

409
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,480
85 or 86 now. So I'm getting really close to 90. And yeah, so I did a couple of streams.

410
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,120
Shane was on there and we were running dungeons talking about random stuff. I'm very thankful.

411
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,000
Shane will stream with me. So I have someone to talk to because then that way it doesn't matter

412
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,680
if like no one's watching, we're able to have a conversation. It's really nice. So that's been

413
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:42,800
fun to stream. Also been playing. I think I sometimes understate how much I play some of the

414
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:49,280
mobile games like Pikmin, which, I mean, Pikmin is really like a set it and forget it kind of game

415
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,600
when you're like planting flowers and stuff. But those games really do incentivize the walking

416
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:00,320
that I do and the exercise that I've been getting. And I've been very transparent here on this show

417
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,720
that I made a lot of changes with a lot of my lifestyle stuff about six months ago. And today

418
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:14,560
I hit a landmark of 45 pounds lost since last summer, basically. And a lot of that is

419
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:22,640
gamification of walking through things like Pokemon Go, Ingress somewhat. And Pikmin has

420
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,120
been huge with it because Pikmin Bloom came out right around the time all that started happening.

421
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,240
So it's been hugely like motivational for that stuff. So if it seems like I'm always talking

422
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,560
about the same games. I also sometimes don't talk enough about some of them that I really I

423
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,160
do put a lot in because it it incentivizes the real world moving around stuff that I need to be

424
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:50,240
really doing a lot right now. So I just hit level 55 or am I 56? I'm somewhere in there in Pikmin.

425
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,720
So I'm getting pretty pretty. I'm at the point where my level is in silver, it changes to silver

426
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:01,040
at 50. So I know the level cap is 100. So someday, I'll get there. I'll try and keep trying.

427
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,720
Otherwise, I actually I actually played a little bit of Dead by Daylight today,

428
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,480
which I haven't been playing as much of that lately. But they're doing an event this weekend,

429
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,360
they just launched a new rift. I don't think it's our show notes tonight. So they made a big deal

430
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:22,880
that they they have announced that one of their characters is gay. And as part of the you know,

431
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,160
they know they know that the LGBTQIA plus community keeps them afloat on Twitch. And so

432
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,680
it's one of those things where they knew they needed the representation of the game. So they

433
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:42,240
did it. Um, a lot of different hot takes on it. Some folks feel that, you know, this character

434
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,040
has been out for six years. And it said, does it seem like it's a little bit pandering? Like,

435
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,080
I get it. Like, it's good to have representation. But it's also like, kind of pandering. Yeah,

436
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,560
yeah, both those things can be true, is that it's nice to have representation. But it does

437
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,200
feel a little bit like pandering. Now, at least I'll say this, it's not June. So at least they're

438
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,320
doing it outside of Pride Month. And they released a really nice new pride charm, they they have the

439
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:13,200
new progress pride flag is available in game to redeem to which is nice. You know, and again,

440
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,840
it's one of those things where it's like, well, I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth.

441
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:21,760
I'm glad the representation is there. That's cool. But does it feel a little bit like,

442
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,120
gosh, a lot of players are leaving our game. I hope the gays don't leave us. We better throw

443
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,160
them a gay character. And you know what, let's make the most conventionally stereotypically

444
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,520
hot one, the gay one, the shirtless one, the gay one. And sure enough, that's what we got.

445
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,760
And so there's a little bit of, I don't know, there's just a little bit of, hmm, hmm. But

446
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,840
but I'm not complaining. But it's also just dead by daylight. It's whatever.

447
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,440
But I want to make clear, that's not the reason why I started playing again. I mean, it's neat.

448
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,840
And I did log in to get the new pride flag. That was more of a big deal than the character to be

449
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,280
quite honest, because I don't care about lore. Dark soccer, she cares about lore. Maybe she

450
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,640
has more of an opinion on that. We can ask her next week. But I don't really care about lore.

451
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:14,000
I just care about the game. So anyway, but they have the double rift tokens going on right now.

452
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,440
And you know, that means you can earn cosmetic rewards, which is kind of fun. So I've been

453
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,840
playing a little bit of that. So all right, let's move on and get into some other gaming news for

454
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:30,720
the week. And Loki is going to start us off tonight, talking about, you know, some schedules,

455
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,600
some schedule not changes, some things, some things just stay the same, I guess.

456
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,400
Some things just, you know, some things the venue was already rented.

457
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:47,120
Right. So Microsoft in well, Bethesda, and now Microsoft are going to be continuing

458
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:54,800
the tradition of having a presentation that interrupts our show on June 12. So they're

459
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:02,080
going to be doing the Microsoft and Bethesda not E3 showcase that will show off what's going to be

460
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:10,640
coming up on their Xbox and PC and game pass ecosystems. Cool. I'm excited.

461
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,040
Yeah, it's it's actually even though there is no E3 this year.

462
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,480
It's actually at 10am. Oh, my mistake. Yeah, it won't interrupt our show this time.

463
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,680
But it's it's nice that they're keeping some of the pomp and circumstance that gamers come to

464
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,720
expect from June. So it's nice to see that Microsoft slash Bethesda is kind of holding

465
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,360
down the fort, so to speak. And now that it's both those companies at the same time, because

466
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,920
I don't, you know, with the pandemic and everything, we haven't really had a traditional

467
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,840
event in a while. So it'll be kind of neat to see Microsoft and Bethesda sort of joining forces

468
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,440
for this this year in a little, which I would assume is going to be a little more

469
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:56,400
feel a little more traditional, maybe. So yeah, and I would bet that they booked the venue

470
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,360
a year ago. Probably probably before there wasn't going to be an E3.

471
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:11,600
Anyway, do I dare ask or is it just stupid to ask? What do you think they're going to show?

472
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,840
What do you think we're going to get? I mean, Starfield, Fable, probably more content for

473
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:25,120
Halo Infinite. I don't know. Microsoft has so many studios now. I mean, there could be a plethora of

474
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,960
things that they could show. Yeah, I think start a Starfield with the game. We know Starfield's

475
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,320
coming out in November, unless they push it back, which they could always do. But I think they will,

476
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,680
you know, Bethesda is not afraid to release a game with bugs. So Starfield will probably still come

477
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,240
out in November. So I would fully expect we're going to get a deep dive in Starfield in June.

478
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,400
I am pretty hyped about that. I like space. So I'm curious, you know how that game is going to look

479
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:59,360
and play. I'm hoping it's Elder Scrolls in space. I really am. So we'll see. Speaking of Elder

480
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:05,520
Scrolls, I'm not expecting that we see Elder Scrolls 6, but I'd be really excited if we got

481
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,000
a little more than what we've had so far, like another teaser. You know, I think because Starfield

482
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,280
is this year, it would be silly to expect Elder Scrolls 6 is also this year. I think that game is

483
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:22,320
probably still two years away, but I would be excited for new Fallout, not 76. Although we

484
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:28,560
probably will get some Fallout 76 content that they'll probably show off. But another huge thing

485
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,240
I want to see, and I'm so excited about it because I do think it'll be, I think this is going to be

486
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:39,680
a this year release, the Fable game from, you know, the Forza Horizon team. I am fucking excited

487
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,040
about that. And I'm thinking June is when we're going to get to see some actual footage. There

488
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,280
better be some really awesome, like some really awesome wagon racing in that game.

489
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,040
Now you want them to make an Oregon Trail game.

490
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,360
Where you can, you can race the Oregon Trail and for the

491
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:08,160
I want it like Oregon Trail, but literally with the horizon. The horizon, not horizon, with the

492
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,600
yeah, like with with the the modern Racing D aesthetic to it, like, you know, this Oregon Trail,

493
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,080
I want the same radio stations in there, even though it's completely unrealistic, like I just

494
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:27,200
want it. Absolutely. Just that. Okay. Modern Oregon, Oregon Trail. I'm down. I'm down. I

495
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:34,560
think that's exciting. All right. Let's see. I guess we should move on to our next story.

496
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,120
Which of course, bear with me a little bit here. All right. So let's talk a little bit about

497
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:49,440
PlayStation Plus, because we're gonna get the new PlayStation Plus and the, you know, the new

498
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,200
cloud stuff. Well, it's not really new, but there's a whole bunch of new stuff getting

499
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:59,200
added to it. We're getting that later in June, which by the way, have we had Sony confirm that

500
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,440
they are planning something for June? We haven't had them confirmed yet, right?

501
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:10,160
Think so. They do their own thing. But I mean, all of these changes are supposed to happen what

502
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,080
like around like June 13, or something, which is very conveniently timed right around that,

503
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,200
right? Or not E3. June 13 is when it's supposed to launch in the US. So I mean,

504
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,720
it's very conveniently timed to have an unveil of what all is going to be in that. But anyway,

505
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,800
anyway. However, even though this is Sony's answer to Game Pass, in some ways, it's not going to fall

506
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,680
for the same stuff that Game Pass fell for. Meaning, if you're trying to stack up your

507
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,600
subscription to get many free years of the ultimate PlayStation Plus, tough cookie,

508
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:52,800
you cannot do it. It's already been shut down. Sony has temporarily disabled the ability to stack

509
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,920
PlayStation Plus subscription time ahead of these new changes that are coming in June.

510
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,840
The company will take the longest running active subscription when setting the converted memberships

511
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,720
end date. So basically, you could stock up on regular Plus cards to get the same time as a

512
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,840
premium subscriber you could have before, but you can't do that anymore. And more information has

513
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,600
come out since then about exactly how many days things will convert to. So it's like if you have

514
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,160
like a PlayStation now it only converts like 18 years later. So anyway, if you didn't get in on

515
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:30,160
this early, it's already been shut down. So yep, cool. Glad they're doing everything they can to

516
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,520
make it not a good deal. Orange writing chat says my current subscription lasts until March 2024.

517
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,320
Well, lucky you, lucky you because you get got in on that before they changed everything. So

518
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,760
yeah, I'm curious what the new PlayStation Plus is going to look like with all the retro games. But

519
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,120
you know, it just kind of depends on what's in there, I think a little bit.

520
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:58,080
So but we're starting to get our first glance at what might be in there. Because

521
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:04,080
apparently some of the games that are going to be on the premium PlayStation Plus,

522
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:11,680
they're starting to leak onto the PlayStation Network. Users on Reddit found new listings for

523
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,280
classic titles with new thumbnail art. And apparently they're starting to show up within

524
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,440
that PSN backend. So these would be games that are very likely for PlayStation Plus. So games

525
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:31,120
that have been discovered so far Tekken 2 from Namco, Mr. Driller, and Ridge Racer for the PSP

526
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,840
all have been spotted on there. But that's it. So that's only three games out of what like 450

527
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:44,640
that we know of so far. But I mean, I'm excited to see Ridge Racer coming back. I wish it was a new

528
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:51,040
Ridge Racer. But I also mentioned Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party as well. Yes, those got

529
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,160
spotted later. So a few days later, they found Yeah, those two games as well. So but we don't

530
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:02,400
have any official confirmation from Sony as of yet. Orange Wright says cool to see PSP games.

531
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,600
Yes, we actually we did know that PSP games were coming out as part of this too. What we don't know

532
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,480
yet PlayStation Vita, they never did confirm that. So I wouldn't expect PlayStation Vita.

533
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,280
And that might have to do with the backtouch panel maybe making a lot of games. But there's

534
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,560
a lot on the Vita that wouldn't need that you would think I don't know. Well, they did put out

535
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:33,520
a console called the PlayStation TV that doesn't have a back panel. So I guess. All right. Well,

536
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:41,280
let's move on. More updates in Sony's world sort of right. Yep. So apparently, there's rumors

537
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,880
that Final Fantasy 16 is near the end of development, according to the producer.

538
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:57,040
Um, so I guess we'll be seeing this soon. Maybe if it's something in June, I think it's about time

539
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:04,320
we're gonna see some more, you know, the last the last 10% is also the last 90%. So it could be wild,

540
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:12,480
you know? So we'll see. But yeah, Final Fantasy 16. Well, something to consider to when that game

541
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,400
was first unveiled, what about a year ago at this point, right? When that game was first unveiled,

542
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,640
it was really far along like just in what you were seeing in the trailer and all that stuff. I mean,

543
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,400
they were running it on a PC emulating PlayStation. But I mean, still, like just with the cutscenes

544
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,120
you were seeing, they showed in game combat footage and stuff like that. So like, the game

545
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:38,800
did seem like it was pretty far along at that point last year than it has been the most games

546
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,160
are when they announce them. So, you know, but again, obviously, I want the game to be good.

547
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,640
I so I want them to take their time and just get it right. But you know, again, with Yoshida

548
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,120
producing it, who has basically saved the Final Fantasy franchise with Final Fantasy 14, in my

549
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:02,640
opinion, I, I have big expectations for this game, which is probably a dangerous thing. But I really,

550
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:10,240
I really, really can't wait for it. So like, I hope it's this holiday. But I will wait longer

551
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,320
if I need to for the game to be right, I guess is what I'm trying to say. I need to go back and

552
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:19,440
finish the Final Fantasy seven remake and stuff and 15. It's pretty good. Seven is pretty good.

553
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:27,120
15 is okay. 15 is worth your time. But I did find the last sequence to be a bit of a letdown,

554
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,120
although it did have a good ending. I will say the ending scene was more satisfying than most.

555
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,480
I'm so just, I don't even want to call it old school. I'm just old at this point. But like,

556
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:44,320
I missed the term Bates Final Fantasy games. Like, that's what it was. This is this fast

557
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:50,560
actions too fast for my feeble elderly hands. According to the internet, you know,

558
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:55,120
because like, elderly is 25 now. So get good. I don't really know what that's. I don't really

559
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,680
look at me. But like, get good. I guess like, I don't know, like, I just want to like,

560
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,160
I just want to relax and be able to strategize on like, what I need to do and not like have to

561
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,600
do all that. I don't know. Remember, Final Fantasy 15 did have two modes. It had the

562
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:17,440
normal weight mode or whatever. I know it did. And I played the demo and the demo was

563
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:25,200
fine, I guess. But like, it's just not the same. You know, like, I like I miss, like, honestly,

564
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,760
when we were looking at Final Fantasy games, like how they kind of work. Like Lost Odyssey was a

565
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,680
great Final Fantasy game like that. That's how it should be like, modern, modern game with like,

566
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,160
the Final Fantasy combat. I mean, that's kind of what it is. Well, some would argue go play

567
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:49,280
Octopath Traveler. That's what Square Enix is doing now. Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

568
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,360
I have a live coming out soon. I'm just I'm just stubborn. I guess I don't know. I just need to

569
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,120
give it another chance. That's like why I haven't really played like Kingdom Hearts either. Because

570
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:03,040
like, oh, yeah, I still buy them for some stupid reason. But like, I haven't played the kids.

571
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,480
The kids don't play those games. Some day. They don't play those games. Like, yeah, sure.

572
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,840
Yeah, so like, I help you. And now you are like, um, yeah, I don't know. I want to enjoy those

573
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,680
games. But they're so convoluted. Like Final Fantasy 15. Like kind of bored me. Like,

574
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,480
I couldn't really follow the storyline. It was just, I don't know. I didn't give it much of a

575
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,440
chance. But I'll go back to it at some point. I don't know. Bobby Blackwolf and chat says

576
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:37,360
persona is a great turn based JRPG. But it's a time commitment. Bobby, Bobby, Bobby. I'm so

577
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:43,520
disappointed. That was the perfect opportunity for you to say your kooza like a dragon is a

578
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:49,920
great JRPG. And it is that is a great way to play it again. And you that is like opportunity you

579
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:57,040
know, you windows close now that you you are correct. That is a great RPG. And I do love

580
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,960
that game. And that is a game I do need to go back and finish. I just need to get my Xbox Series X

581
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,920
back from my sister who's been borrowing it for the last four months. So I need to get that back

582
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,880
so I can finish that game. But yes, that is a great game. And I hear it has a great story. So

583
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:21,040
more of that, please. Like I will take you know, I'll take the kooza games are fun. I like that,

584
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,720
you know, but like, let's put that same team on like something else to like, you know,

585
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,400
yes, they are. They're now making that's now the main Yakuza series. So yes, they will be

586
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:38,000
making some nice roast muffin in our chat. Hello, hello says the seven remake is the best of the

587
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,160
like action based Final Fantasy. And I do I definitely agree the seven remake was far better

588
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,440
than it had any right to be like honestly, and just that one was okay. I maybe I can just ease

589
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:56,720
myself into that type of gameplay with seven and then go into 15. And yes, here's the thing about

590
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,120
seven like and I don't know how much you've spoiled yourself on the story. And quite frankly,

591
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:05,280
we're far past the moratorium on spoilers. And I ought to be able to talk openly about it now.

592
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,360
However, no, I'm gonna buy my tongue for the listeners. But I'm just gonna say, again,

593
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:18,720
the story in seven. Like you, you think you know, what's gonna happen. And I assure you,

594
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,960
you do not know what's going to happen. And it's it's worth playing. Because I think that

595
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:32,160
commentary in and of itself is very good. Like again, like this, the seven remake is really

596
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:40,160
worth playing just on the commentary of remakes in general. I'll say that much. It's very interesting.

597
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:48,080
So play it. All right. But I know I know how it goes. Look, you have a 200,000 brick mountain to

598
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:55,760
make in Minecraft. You have no fucking time. I'm done with the brick mountain for now. But yes,

599
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:02,240
I would need to go back. Yes, I would need to. Well, no, see, that's the thing like and going

600
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,680
back to the whole content creation thing. You don't know what's going on behind the scenes.

601
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,400
Like, I feel like constantly, it's like, okay, video put out now, clock reset, but it's still

602
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,280
ticking. You know, it's like, I gotta go out and put more stuff out, especially my hardcore series,

603
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,040
because there's that's what's bringing the viewers is that so like, I got to give the

604
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:25,520
people what they want. And so E3VL in chat says Final Fantasy seven remake is essentially a

605
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:32,480
multiverse game. That's about as far into spoiler territory. I'm going to let you go. But yes. Yes.

606
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:39,760
And that's, that's what yeah, the multiverse is all the rage right now. So I know I'm excited.

607
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,280
And let me tell you again, while we're talking multiverse, you must see the movie everything

608
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:51,600
everywhere all at once. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. And I apologize if I'm

609
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:57,600
hyping this up too much. But I really urge you don't read anything about the movie. Just go see

610
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:04,320
it and you will be so so satisfied. It is just it is just a good fucking movie. And it does. It goes

611
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:09,360
to show that movies do not have to be gigantic budgets, like Marvel style movies. That's no shade

612
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,520
on Marvel. Because you know, those those movies have their place too. But I am super excited

613
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,200
about Dr. Strange. Yeah, I know. And lots of people are and that's great. I'm excited. But

614
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,520
just just and Michelle Yeoh, end of sentence, Michelle Yeoh, period. End of sentence. That's

615
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,760
all that needs to be said. Michelle Yeoh, the grand and short round. I don't remember his name.

616
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,520
But yeah, like, I hear he's great in it. Oh, oh my god, that the fact that he's come back from

617
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:40,000
acting after like 40 years and does that. I mean, people are gonna forget this movie come Oscar

618
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,920
time and I don't put a lot of stock into awards. I hope not. It is it is our responsibility as the

619
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:52,960
internet internet rally around me. It is our responsibility as the internet period. A

620
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:58,880
corporation. Al Gore's internet is our responsibility. That the Academy does not forget

621
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,800
about this movie come next Oscar season. And if Michelle Yeoh doesn't get nominated,

622
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,920
I was gonna make a slap joke, but then I realized I'll be in bad taste. So I'm not gonna make it.

623
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,080
All right, let's move on. Loki, you have another story for us.

624
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:25,440
Yes. So Game Freak is implementing an optional four day workweek, which sounds amazing. So

625
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:31,760
they're giving employees an extra day off of the week for the purpose of childcare or family care.

626
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,880
And they're it's able to be done on a monthly basis to have like a flexible work environment,

627
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:46,720
they said, where needed. But it does come with a 20% pay cut. So if it's a four day workweek,

628
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,120
and you're not working an extra day, so there's not paying you for that paying you for that day.

629
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,640
Exactly. Yes. So that is a bit misleading.

630
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,480
That's just more. That's not paid time off either. That's

631
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,200
yeah, that's just that's just you can work only four days and we'll give you four fifth salary

632
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:12,720
for doing that. But I mean, you have an option. At least they have benefits.

633
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,280
Yeah, there are some people, you know, as much as we're kind of staring at this and

634
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,880
blinking right now. There are people where this would fit very well into their life.

635
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:28,320
And you know, it's like, oh, I could hold down a full time job and benefits and so forth. But also

636
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:34,160
have that extra day for the bandwidth, I need to, you know, take care of kids, go to school,

637
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,720
whatever it is, you know, everybody's life. And it's optional. So at least they have an

638
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,920
option to do that. And you know, it's you have just have to weigh it. But at the very least,

639
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,320
like if it were in the United States, and they were not paying you for that extra day,

640
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,480
they would probably take away your benefits as well. Because you're not a full time employee

641
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,680
at that point. You know, like, that's the kind of shitty things that US employers do. So

642
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,400
cool. Like to see them do that.

643
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,040
SSU 100. Matt says I do know places and friends who work at places where they have for

644
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:12,000
10 hour days. Yeah, I do. Actually, my Yeah, my day job company has this option as well.

645
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,000
First, most positions, sometimes the position doesn't kind of let you do that. But for most

646
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:25,520
positions, you can do that. But yeah, and for the work at home, especially where you're not

647
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,800
commuting. I think that works very well for a lot of people.

648
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:35,440
I would totally do that. But unfortunately, I'm your salary. So for my for 10 hour days,

649
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,880
and then another eight hour day, it's still paid the same. So it's like,

650
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,360
yeah, unfortunately, you can't do that. But that was an option. I know back when I was in our

651
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:48,960
customer service center, when we were in the call center, the EU could do for 10s if you wanted to.

652
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,360
I just couldn't swing that either.

653
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:56,960
Yeah. So again, sometimes with schedule, like, you know, you have kids, it's harder to work 10

654
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,040
hour days when you have to get your kid from school and those those sorts of needs. That's

655
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:07,920
harder to do. So you know, it just depends on your life situation. So but it's nice to see employers

656
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:16,800
have that flexibility. And I think that is a huge thing that the pandemic. Good employers have

657
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,680
responded to the pandemic with more flexibility. Good ones have and they'll they'll persevere for

658
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:28,880
that. Anyhow, let's move on. We were talking about PlayStation Plus a little bit ago.

659
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:34,880
Let's talk about those game trials. Because again, part of the perks for PlayStation Plus is that

660
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,760
you're supposed to get free game trials up to like a certain, I think two hours in or something

661
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:45,280
like that to really get a robust taste of the game. And there was some reporting going around

662
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:51,520
on social media that Sony is asking developers to create time limited trials for games for the new

663
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:59,040
PlayStation Plus premium service. But now it's coming out from Ethan Gack at Kotaku that actually

664
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:04,080
the PlayStation store team is going to take this on and set up the trials for the developers. So

665
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:10,720
it's interesting how that rumor led to this kind of shifting course here. But in a tweet, Ethan

666
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:17,680
says sources tell me, of course, a good old source, which means that somebody inside Sony that just

667
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,880
doesn't want to get in trouble. PlayStation store team will create the two hour time trials for

668
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,160
developers. So it shouldn't be extra work, though I've heard concerns from others about Sony

669
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,840
monetizing a perk and not sharing that revenue with studios. That's an interesting side effect

670
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:39,440
is that you know, there might be people that play the two hour demo and decide not to get the game.

671
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:45,200
And the publisher doesn't get anything from that, even though Sony did. Well, demos,

672
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,560
I would assume this is gonna work just like the trials work with I think. I think it was EA that

673
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:57,680
was, you know, actually, not that they mentioned the trials and stuff. Wasn't it Sony that was

674
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,880
doing that? I thought they were already doing trials for full games. Or maybe I'm thinking EA

675
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,360
or something like that through their like EA thinking early accessing, you're thinking of

676
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:12,400
EA through their EA player, whatever it's called. Yeah, I swear to God, though, there was something

677
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:18,880
outside of EA that was doing full, they were doing like, trials for like, full games or something

678
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,520
like that. Well, steam, if you want to, I mean, it's not really a trial, but they do the refund

679
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:30,880
within two hours. And some people abuse that as a trial. Well, no, not not like that. But like,

680
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:42,960
I want to say like, gosh, was it? PlayStation was through PlayStation Plus, actually, they had full

681
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:48,400
game trials, this is a great way to try before you buy, play a game for up to one hour or and

682
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,240
then purchase the game to unlock trophies and continue your progress. So this is something

683
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,320
they already had. This is not a new thing. They had it on PlayStation four. Interesting,

684
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:00,720
but now it's going up to two hours. And it's only going to be in PlayStation premium.

685
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,120
That's interesting.

686
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:08,640
Whoo, we we changed the one to a two and then we charged you for it.

687
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:14,080
That's that that that does on beyond that does track with Sony. Remember when playing online was

688
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:21,360
free? That's some that's some Yuji Naka level tweaking, you know, services there, you know.

689
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,760
Next story.

690
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,120
So you want to hear something scary? They're going to be making a Poppy Playtime movie.

691
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,760
No, that's pretty cool. No, I'm totally I would totally watch that. It's awesome. But yeah,

692
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:44,320
so Poppy Playtime, if you're not aware, is a indie survival horror video game that involves a

693
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:53,120
toy factory with, you know, fun creatures like Fuzzy Wuzzy or Huggy Wuggy or something like that.

694
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:01,280
I don't remember his name, but yes, so horror game with giant like puppets and stuff like that.

695
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:08,560
But it is being developed by Studio 71, who, if you're not familiar with that name, they did the

696
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:15,520
VHS series. It was like a bunch of kind of I don't know if it was like a horror anthology

697
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,640
or something like that. But I remember it had to do with like people finding VHS

698
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:26,640
tapes with like horrible things on it. So of course, you know, the company Mob Games

699
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:32,800
that develops the game is said that they could have never imagined that this game be so popular

700
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,920
as it is. And they're beyond excited to work with Studio 71 to transform Poppy into a feature film.

701
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:46,240
So I am excited. It's going to be scary. It is going to be damn scary. But like,

702
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:53,040
I want to see that. And also whatever happened to the stupid FNAF movie? Like,

703
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:58,080
is that ever going to happen? I'm so disappointed. Have you seen this? I got a

704
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:04,800
there's this post going around Facebook. Hold on. Okay. I didn't want to show the name of the

705
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,360
person. But I got I got it from the I'll show the name of the sheriff's office that shared it

706
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:13,840
because this is this is wild. Do you want to see this latest thing going around Facebook as I saw?

707
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:19,360
Because I used to at my old job, I used to work with some Karen's so I still follow some on

708
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:24,960
Facebook. And one of them posted this. So it's from Okay, hold on. Let's show this here. How do I

709
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,440
let me do? Hold on. Sorry, bear with me because I'm doing it live.

710
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:36,640
There. Okay. Attention parents. The county sheriff's office looked at the origins of a

711
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,640
controversy about a character named Huggy Wuggy from a survival horror video game called poppy

712
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:45,280
playtime. This is a survival horror video game developed and published by American indie developer

713
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:51,440
mob games, etc, etc, etc. They're issuing a warning to parents due to a series of videos

714
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,320
surrounding Huggy Wuggy. The warnings are due to the characters initially child friendly videos,

715
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:01,200
which very quickly turned nightmarish. The concerning videos are fan made,

716
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,520
produced by someone who admires a particular TV show, film or video game. Here are some of the

717
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:10,240
YouTube channels that made the concerning videos and there's a list there. The videos include

718
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:15,440
offensive language, cartoon representations of alcohol use, blood stabbings, decapitations,

719
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:20,080
attempted murder, murder and the bloody aftermath of a car crash. And one of the videos a toy

720
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,880
cartoon character tells a cartoon person, my hugs don't hurt one bit, you'll be dead before

721
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,280
the pain comes. The character then hugs and squeezes the person until they turn blue and

722
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:40,000
passes out. What? Why? Why are the police warning people about YouTube content is what I want to

723
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,720
know. That's what struck me as like wild. When I saw that Facebook post, I was like, wait, is this

724
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:52,880
is this actually poppy playtime or no, this is like YouTube people using poppy poppy playtime.

725
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:58,560
This is getting into the whole Elsa Spider-Man nonsense that the like the dark side of like

726
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:03,920
YouTube, like bot farms and stuff like that to create these weird like procedure, not even

727
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,560
procedurally generated, it's just like, just garbage stuff that children will click on.

728
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:14,480
And yeah, there's probably a lot of fan videos and stuff about poppy playtime and stuff because

729
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:23,360
because that's the thing. But I don't understand why the police need to be involved with this as

730
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:28,560
far as like, warning people in true video game fashion, or I'm sorry, in true Facebook fashion.

731
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,600
Can I go to this comment here? Yeah, first of all, the LCSD should be ashamed of itself for

732
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,360
this fear mongering anti video game post. Not all video games are for kids. Those still stuck in the

733
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:43,440
video games are toys for children mindset have no one to blame for themselves. If their children

734
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:51,360
are exposed to content they deem inappropriate 59 replies and I hesitate to think what they're

735
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:56,560
all gonna be positive anyway, I'm sure parents watch what your kids are consuming. That's the

736
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:07,920
bottom line here, right? All right. Sorry, I had to bring that up. I just when I saw that on

737
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,720
Facebook, I was like, what in the what is this world? Then I hope their kids get taken to the

738
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,560
movies to go see poppy playtime. The wonderful like, it's like the Muppets.

739
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,480
SSG 100. Matt says, Oh, God reading the comments live. Yeah, sometimes sometimes what does this

740
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:27,760
show become? Oh, I'm sure the movie can be rated R and kids will still show up anyway. Come on,

741
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:32,640
you go to any R rated movie these days. You go to you go to Mortal Kombat in the theaters and

742
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,480
people are like, Oh, whatever. I'm taking my kid because you know, it's a video game.

743
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:43,440
I saw this, I saw a video online about this theater chain that literally has

744
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:47,840
Emma assuming these are special theaters for like, kids movies and stuff, but they literally have

745
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:54,320
like, one of those play structures in the movie theater itself. It's like a McDonald's new play

746
01:09:54,320 --> 01:10:00,960
structure thing with like movies and like actual kids movies and stuff. Tell me where I'm going

747
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:06,000
without telling me where I'm never going. I mean, I'm assuming it's for like special

748
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,760
like kids movies only but it'd be funny though they play poppy playtime that I prefer the reverse

749
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,320
of that like I don't know if they still do this but the kabuki kabuki theater in San Francisco

750
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:21,360
has several screens where since they sell alcohol, it's 21 and up only that is my favorite place to

751
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:29,280
see a movie. Yeah, that's I think they do that over here locally at our they call it the plaudio

752
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:34,800
Lux thing but they do have I think certainly screen times where it may serve alcohol time but

753
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:41,520
they have I think they do have certain it's a separate theater it's like right around the

754
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,080
corner of the regular patio but those are the ones where you have like the fancy like you can order

755
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:52,160
food and alcohol and stuff if you want and they have a bar but SSJ 100 Matt says I snuck into

756
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:57,440
barbed wire when I was 13. Wasn't that that Pamela Anderson movie? That movie is terrible.

757
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:02,960
Yeah, but you know what? There's there's a lot in that movie for a 13 year old boy.

758
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:12,240
At least y'all maybe maybe not all boys because I don't think that movie did anything for me but

759
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:18,240
some of y'all I'm sure really enjoyed that film despite the fact it was terrible. All right.

760
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:23,600
Anyhow, let's move on. Loki, why don't you tell us the most unsurprising news of the year?

761
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:30,720
There's gonna be a new Call of Duty what Activision making the game that makes the money

762
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:38,320
what so shocking. So they've announced that the new game they're putting out is Modern Warfare 2

763
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:43,200
and you may be thinking, well, wait a second there. I swear I remember there being a Modern

764
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:48,000
Warfare 2 before. In fact, I'm pretty sure there's a Modern Warfare 3. Well, this is the new Modern

765
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,040
Warfare 2, which is actually like Call of Duty 17 or something like that. I'm not really sure what

766
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:57,920
number that they're on now, but yeah, they're doing it's the sequel to the Modern Warfare

767
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:06,320
1 reboot thing. So it's a reboot sequel. Yeah, number 10 in the Modern Warfare series.

768
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,120
Do you own them all, Loki?

769
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,680
I own like the first three.

770
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:22,480
Technically, like, there's one, two and three. And then reflex was on the Wii, I think. And

771
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:27,360
then there's mobile games. There's the remasters. I don't have the remasters. And then I don't have

772
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:32,400
the new. I may have the new Modern Warfare because that may have been a PlayStation plus title at one

773
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:39,520
time. I may actually own all of them. I don't know, except for the mobile and the Wii version.

774
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,120
I wouldn't buy the Wii version.

775
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,960
Darktitsia in chat says maybe they should just put the year on it like Madden does.

776
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,440
Call of Duty 22. Would you play that?

777
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:54,240
I like the Modern Warfare games, honestly. I don't know how the last reboot thing was,

778
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,800
but like the first three Modern Warfare games were pretty good. I really like the first three

779
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:05,040
ones. But that's that's Activision of like the way past when it wasn't super terrible. Like the

780
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:10,880
games are good and they didn't have a loot boxes and stuff. But we're never going back to those

781
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,560
days again. Unfortunately.

782
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:17,040
E3VL in chat says can't put the year. They'll think it's based on Ukraine Russia war. Oof.

783
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:22,480
But I mean, kind of true. I mean, yeah, yeah, there are people types of conclusions.

784
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:28,400
And then there's another fun thing. So with Call of Duty Vanguard, they've added a new anti cheat

785
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:36,240
tool that now allows them to basically detect when they're doing the cheating. And they have

786
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:42,080
a new mitigation technique called cloaking that will make everybody but the cheater invisible.

787
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:49,440
So if they catch you wall hacking, you're going to be wall hacking ghosts, I guess.

788
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:55,600
The ways they trap and screw over cheat. Well, I mean, I wouldn't call it screwing over cheaters

789
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,600
because cheaters deserve it. But, you know, the pranks, I don't know, the punks they're playing

790
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:04,800
on cheaters are getting funnier and funnier. Devs are more and more clever with how they do that.

791
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,720
I always like the cheater island where you just put the cheater in games with other cheaters and

792
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:13,760
let them Yeah, that was granted thought of online, they used to do that. And people

793
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,040
just didn't really care. Like, oh, well, you know, well, right. That's,

794
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,280
and a lot of times you get put there for stupid things. I think some people like

795
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:27,680
being on cheater Island, quite frankly. So yeah, yeah. So well, you know, this is

796
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,360
it's not that ridiculous. You know, at least they're doing something unlike, you know, what

797
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:41,840
they're doing with what Blizzard is doing with Overwatch two, which is basically nothing.

798
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:52,880
Well, moving on to another story is that there's now 91 games that you can no longer play online.

799
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,200
Now, I do want to make sure there's kind of two important parts of the story because one of the

800
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:02,880
headlines that's going around is that Ubisoft is going to be shutting down services for 91 games.

801
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:09,040
But here's what's actually happened is that there was a blog post with a timestamp that was wrong

802
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:14,240
on it that said there's a list of 91 games have now been shut down. So it made it look like all

803
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:19,200
these games were shut down at once. But Ubisoft actually apologized for the confusion saying,

804
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:26,400
these are games that have all ended online services over the last year. So it is not 91

805
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:31,440
games that they shut down all at once. These are 91 games that have been actually shut down over

806
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:36,800
the last year. Most people probably just haven't talked about, yeah, it's a lot, but most people

807
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:42,000
probably haven't talked about it because most people probably didn't even notice. I mean,

808
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:49,760
there's games that are on this list that are on the Xbox 360, Far Cry Blood Dragon on PS3, Xbox 360

809
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:56,240
and PC, no longer playable online, but there's games on here for the Wii. How about Just Dance

810
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:02,400
3 Kids? I know I'm sure you're all beat up about that. But Just Dance 3 Kids is no longer playable

811
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:08,080
online. But there are some relatively newer games like that Far Cry Blood Dragon was released in

812
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:14,480
2020, I think, right? That game was awesome. Yeah. So Blood Dragon was not released in 2020.

813
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:20,320
You're right. I'm mixing it up. That's the date that it was actually retired.

814
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,800
Yeah, Blood Dragon came out a while ago, but that game is fantastic.

815
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:30,320
That is like one of the best spin offs of Far Cry game ever.

816
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:35,600
Yeah. I'm trying to see some games in here that are definitely taken down a bit more recently.

817
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:44,880
Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Rainbow Six Vegas, Rainbow Six Lockdown. So anyway, it's just part of the

818
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,320
natural ebb and flow of the cycle of video games is that online servers, they get shut down,

819
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:56,400
especially if no one's on there playing them. So perhaps we need to go back to a simpler time

820
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:03,680
when there were no video games servers online. So you could just keep playing games forever.

821
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,480
So let's get to this segment.

822
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:21,040
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

823
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:26,000
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

824
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:33,520
Well, and as we discussed earlier in the show, Dark Sakura is not here tonight. So I'm picking

825
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,320
tonight's classic game, which I have picked Ultima. And I'm sorry, Loki. I would have let

826
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,760
you pick this time, but I didn't have a lot of notice. So I just had to throw something together.

827
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:47,760
So I had to think like, all right, what haven't I done yet? That's a game that I have a lot of

828
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:54,000
feelings. I could just talk about this game very easily for a little bit. And I came up on Ultima

829
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,280
4 Quest of the Avatar. So I've talked a little bit about Ultima 3. I think, you know, years ago,

830
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,920
I picked that as a classic game. But I want to talk a little bit about Ultima 4, because Ultima

831
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:12,880
4 is like, the whole Ultima series in general is really an RPG series that gave us a lot that it

832
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:19,440
often doesn't get credited enough for. Because Ultima 4, I mean, and the original Ultima series

833
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:24,320
was of course by Richard Garriott, Lord British on the PC and DOS based systems. Apple, I think

834
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:29,840
may have been where those games first started. They got ported everywhere. But a lot of modern

835
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:36,640
RPGs have a lot from Ultima to thank. And you'll notice that I'm actually playing Ultima 4,

836
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,080
the video here tonight and the music I think you're hearing on stream, I think it's coming

837
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:45,840
through, is coming from the NES version of the game. Because this is where I remember playing

838
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:50,320
Ultima 4 for the first time. It might surprise you, I did not play this on the Commodore 64 at

839
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:56,000
first or any of that stuff. But I actually originally played this on the NES. I want

840
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,360
to show you real quick, pardon the live screenshot switching here, but I want to show you real quick

841
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:08,160
what this looks like on the PC because it was a very, very different looking game on the PC.

842
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:12,880
You know, this, it looked a lot more like a traditional role playing game might look,

843
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,800
where you're actually having to input things and try to get, you know, the characters to

844
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,600
interact with you by typing things. You actually see your character moving north, south, east and

845
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:30,800
west. But a lot of this was changed for the NES. So it's just interesting that it is the same game

846
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:36,560
essentially, but they did a lot to really streamline a lot of the stuff that might feel

847
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:42,080
a little bit micromanagy in the game otherwise. So let me flip back here. I'm going to flip back

848
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:47,040
to the NES version because quite honestly, I think it has a better soundtrack. Oops,

849
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:51,600
sorry, sorry. Now I'm overlaying both games. That's what happens when I have to do it all

850
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:57,760
myself live. Okay, let's get into the weeds a little more on Ultima IV. It was released

851
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:03,440
in 1985, originally for the Apple II. It's considered part of the Age of Enlightenment

852
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:12,480
trilogy. So the interesting thing about Ultima IV, it's the first RPG in quite some time.

853
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:18,720
You're not trying to overcome a tangible Ultima evil. You're not trying to beat chaos.

854
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:26,800
You're not trying to defeat Lord Evil Doer. You know, this is a very different setup in this game.

855
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:32,640
So basically the way this is all put together is that the Triad of Evil from the previous Ultima

856
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:38,960
games changed the world of Sosaria. So some of the world disappeared. There were new continents.

857
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,400
It's just basically a way for them to come up with a new map for Sosaria, basically.

858
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:50,080
Lord British, who, you know, is kind of tongue in cheek, a representation of Richard Garriott

859
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:55,360
in the games, but he's the actual Lord over Britannia. He felt that people lacked purpose

860
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:00,880
after the struggles against the Triad were over and he was concerned with spiritual well-being.

861
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:06,480
So he proclaimed the quest of the Avatar. He needed someone to come forward and be the

862
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:11,600
shining example for others to follow. And that's what this game is, is your ultimate quest of

863
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,800
enlightenment, the quest of the Avatar. So you don't really, like, you're not against like,

864
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,040
oh, we've got this big bad we've got to do. So that's kind of interesting, I think.

865
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,320
Also in the beginning of the game, and a lot of people know this from the beginning of the game,

866
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:32,880
you're asked a series of questions that ultimately determine how your principles of truth,

867
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,080
love, and courage come together to choose what you're going to play in the game. I'm

868
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:42,960
going to rewind the stream here a little bit so you can see it again. But this first section of

869
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:48,720
the game is actually asking you questions about how you would respond in certain scenarios

870
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,320
that ultimately determine the class that you're going to play. So for example,

871
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:59,040
we're going to, let me get the next question here. Fighting it, oh, sorry, this person's

872
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,160
speed running it so it's like flying by. Let me try to get one of these questions.

873
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,920
Listen carefully. Entrusted to deliver an uncounted purse of gold, thou dost meet a

874
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:12,800
poor beggar. Dost thou deliver the gold knowing the trust in thee was well placed, or show

875
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:17,680
compassion, giving the beggar a coin, knowing it shan't be missed? So you're basically taking a

876
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:23,520
personality quest at the beginning of the game. And so in this scenario, do you A, honestly give

877
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:29,760
the money back, or B, show compassion and give the beggar a coin? So based on your answer here,

878
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:35,360
you're going to tilt the scales to either A, honesty, truth, which is a mage, it's embodied

879
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:42,800
by the mage in the game, which is pure, pure truth, honesty, or compassion is pure love,

880
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:48,480
and that is embodied by a bard. So the way you answer these questions, and so the person runs

881
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:52,880
through all these questions here in the intro and I think they ultimately land on a druid.

882
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:59,840
If I saw that, um, play by quick here. So this person landed on truth and love or justice coming

883
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:05,840
together. So you can actually have, and there are, there are eight classes. So truth is a mage,

884
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:12,560
love is a bard, courage is a fighter, truth and love is a druid, love and courage is a, um,

885
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:20,160
tinkerer, truth and courage is a paladin, truth, love, and courage is considered spirituality,

886
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:26,240
and that is a ranger. Or you can actually take a challenge in the game and play none,

887
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:33,440
a character with humility, one that has neither truth, love, nor courage, and that is a shepherd.

888
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:41,760
Now the character, the classes that you don't end up picking end up being NPCs in the game.

889
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,280
So if I fast forward in the footage here a little more, you'll notice that our druid

890
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,480
has put together a party here where it looks like I think they have the fighter,

891
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,400
and I think that's the ranger that they put together in their party there. So those

892
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:58,000
characters exist as NPCs and you put together a party of four people by going around the world

893
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,640
and completing quests and putting your party together to, you know, help you on your quest

894
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:07,440
to become the avatar. So I think it's really neat, like it's just, it's kind of a neat way

895
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:13,280
of building the game, like asking like, you know, your character being reflected by a personality

896
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:18,480
quest or a personality test, I think is really neat, and just how it impacts the ultimate game

897
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:26,000
and potentially its difficulty. So how did this game come about? Well, Richard Garriott got no

898
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,280
feedback because California Pacific Computer and Sierra Online never forwarded him mail.

899
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:39,360
So he finally realized from letters from enraged parents that in the earlier games,

900
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:45,360
doing immoral actions like stealing and murdering peaceful citizens might be things that people

901
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:51,200
would find objectionable. So Richard Garriott took on the task of wanting to be a good storyteller,

902
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:57,120
but a story that has content, and realized that 90% of games out there were just go kill the bad

903
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:03,440
guy. So Ultima IV ended up being a game about ethical overtones and ended up being a better

904
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:09,840
told story. In his official biography, it was said he decided that if people were going to

905
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,720
look for hidden meaning in his work when they didn't even exist, he would introduce ideas and

906
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:19,440
symbols with meaning and significance he deemed worthwhile to give them something they could

907
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:25,200
really think about. So the way this is all set up with a personality test and everything,

908
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:29,920
you're supposed to imagine that you're playing yourself in the fantasy realm and not a separate

909
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,360
person, and that was kind of something a little unique for this game at the time as well.

910
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:41,040
And he removed elements like playing a non-human because he worried that this would prevent players

911
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:45,840
from identifying personally with their character. So I think that's very, very interesting.

912
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:53,200
The ankh is oftentimes used as the symbol of the avatar, and Richard Garriott saw this originally

913
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:58,000
in the film Logan's Run and decided to use this in his game, and that ankh kind of became a symbol

914
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:04,480
for Ultima later on. This game came out on the Apple II, the Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit platforms,

915
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:11,760
a PC-DOS version, the Amiga and the Atari ST, the NES. It was on the Sega Master System, actually.

916
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:17,280
I always forget that the Ultima IV was on the Sega Master System. And I think, if I remember right,

917
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:25,840
sorry while I'm doing this live, but sometimes I do it that way, I want to say that the Sega

918
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,880
Master System, okay, we're going to look at somebody who's actually speedrunning the game.

919
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,200
I want to say, yeah, it looked more like the PC version. It didn't look like the NES version.

920
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:39,200
The NES version was done with completely redone graphics and things like that, and I want to say

921
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:45,120
the same team that did Ultima III did that. But it's interesting to see Ultima IV, I think,

922
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:52,800
on a console but more like the PC version. Oh, kind of interesting. Anyway, the reception for

923
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:57,520
this game, believe it or not, and it's interesting because ZenMonkey11 in chat says this game seems

924
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:04,560
confusing. I think it is. It may not have held up well over time because games have generally

925
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:09,680
gotten easier and so forth, just in that, you know, you don't have to manually type to a

926
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:17,280
character what you want to do anymore. But what this game did for the genre, people consider this

927
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:22,000
one of the best games ever made, if you can believe it. And I do, I do. I think, you know,

928
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,680
a lot of times games like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest get credited for the genre. But I think

929
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:33,280
Ultima IV especially did a ton of stuff for the role-playing genre. And I think there's a lot

930
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:38,720
that we see in games today, especially things like, I would say, the Elder Scrolls series,

931
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:43,920
which also lets you kind of embody yourself in the main character that has Ultima IV to thank for it.

932
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:51,520
Computer Gaming World named Ultima IV as the game of the year in 1986.

933
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:58,480
In 1986, Dragon Magazine called Ultima IV the most impressive and complex adventure to date.

934
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:04,000
Famitsu reviewed the Famicom version of the game and only gave it a 31,

935
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:08,560
but the Sega Master System of the game got an 89% in computer and video games.

936
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:16,320
The co-creator of D&D, Dave Arntzen, said in 1988, Ultima IV and a few other games

937
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:21,760
have stood pretty much alone as quirks instead of trendsetters in the computer RPG industry,

938
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,320
as other games do not follow their innovations. And I think there was another one here.

939
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:35,120
Yeah, in 1996, Computer Gaming World named this game the second best video game of all time.

940
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:40,960
So, interesting. I'm sorry, did I not say Famitsu out of 40? Yeah, 31 out of 40. I'm sorry if I

941
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:46,720
was reading fast and trying to multitask here, so lots going on. But anyway, that's a little insight

942
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:53,760
to Ultima IV, Quest of the Avatar. And I know I played this game quite a bit. It was a hard game.

943
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,120
The battle systems, I found to be kind of hard. I would really like to go back and revisit this

944
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:03,840
game someday as, like, not a kid, because I bet there would be more in the game I would

945
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:08,960
understand that maybe I didn't understand as well before when I first played this game.

946
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,680
But yeah, I think this game is really, it was really transformative for RPGs, especially

947
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:21,040
on these shores and deserves a lot of credit. Questbuster in chat says Ultima IV was big for

948
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:25,840
a number of reasons, but probably it was because of its focus on self-improvement as opposed to

949
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:30,720
just go kill the big evil that really shook things up, as Rob pointed out. Well, thank you.

950
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:36,960
And there it is, the classic game of the week, Ultima IV, Quest of the Avatar.

951
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:42,240
Nice. All right. You ever played that game, Loki?

952
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,840
I have not. I actually don't think I've really played any of the Ultima games, except for,

953
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:53,360
briefly, Ultima Online was at a friend's house, and we were just being obnoxious children.

954
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,480
Yeah, there's nine games. Well, if you don't count online, there's nine games in the Ultima series,

955
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:02,560
if I remember right, because what pagan was eight, and I think there was one after that.

956
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:07,920
So, and they're basically, they are a trilogy of trilogies. And as I kind of referenced there,

957
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,640
one, two, and three were its own trilogy where it is go beat the bad guy. But then four, five,

958
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:17,600
and six kind of started this journey of enlightenment sort of series. And then seven,

959
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,440
eight, nine, I don't remember exactly. I kind of lost track of the series at that point,

960
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:28,800
but they were their own trilogy of things. So, yeah. Anyway, it's really a game worth visiting.

961
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:35,120
And I think especially the NES versions of the Ultima games are really overlooked by time,

962
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,760
because they are so radically different from the computer versions, which are the ones that are

963
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:45,520
credited for being so revolutionary. But the soundtracks to both those games too are really

964
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:50,880
good. I talk about Ultima III a lot. I remember the music in Ultima III very well. It is such a

965
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:57,600
good soundtrack, but those games haven't really held up in gaming people's memory quite as well.

966
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:02,400
I would love to see those games in a compilation someday. Those are the games for me I would love

967
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:06,640
to see on the Switch online, but I realized the rights issues gets complicated and so where they

968
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:12,880
got to convince Richard Garriott it's a good idea, I suppose. So, yeah. All right. Let's check

969
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:17,600
out some other headlines in a segment we call Rapid Fire News. And you got a few things tonight

970
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:22,800
for us, Loki. Yeah. So, Bethesda, because you know they are getting rid of their dedicated

971
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,280
launcher, they are going to be putting their games on Steam. And so, as part of that, they

972
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:33,120
have added five of their classic games to Steam, and some of which are actually free at the moment.

973
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:39,600
So, Elder Scrolls, you get the Elder Scrolls Arena, Elder Scrolls II Daggerfall, the Elder

974
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:45,600
Scrolls Adventures Redguard, and Elder Scrolls Legend Battlespire and Wolfenstein Enemy Territory.

975
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:52,480
Elder Scrolls Arena and Daggerfall are free. And also, apparently, Wolfenstein Enemy Territory is

976
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:57,760
zero dollars right now. I'm not sure that's going to stay that way, but go.

977
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:02,480
I grabbed the two, I forgot about the Wolfenstein game, so I got to go grab that too. But the two,

978
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:10,800
yeah, I grabbed those today. And just a reminder, you can now transfer your Bethesda launcher titles

979
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,880
over to Steam. When this was first reported on a couple months ago, that wasn't available yet,

980
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,320
but that is available now. And so, I actually had all three Quake games, because Bethesda gave

981
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:25,040
them away for free if you downloaded the launcher during QuakeCon at some point. So, now I have all

982
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:30,400
those games on Steam. So, just kind of fun. So, you can transfer that all over today. It's pretty

983
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,880
easy. You just link your Bethesda account to your Steam account, and then you push a button and

984
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,680
wait, basically. Yeah, I got to go do that.

985
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:43,760
Yeah. You have to, I mean, I don't think you can ever not do it, but you might have a lapse when

986
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:48,720
the Bethesda launcher goes away to play the game if you don't go move them over. So, you might as

987
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:51,440
well go ahead and do it. And grab the free games while you're at it. They're free.

988
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:58,000
Sure. The Super Mario Brothers animated movie, which is supposed to come to theaters this

989
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,560
Christmas, is now going to be delayed to April 2023. So, that was put out by a tweet from

990
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:10,800
Nintendo, or I guess Miyamoto, because it says this is Miyamoto. But yes, it's now been delayed

991
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:20,400
to April 7th and April 28th in Japan. So, oh, well, we'll just wait longer, I guess.

992
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,120
All right, whatever.

993
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,240
Yeah.

994
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,720
Fifth Dream in chat says, Christmas canceled by Nintendo. You know what,

995
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:33,600
though? Here's something to consider. The theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood

996
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,360
is going to open around that same timeframe. It's not opening this holiday. It's opening

997
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,640
spring 2023.

998
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:56,080
Apparently, BBC Proms is celebrating classical and orchestral music every year. They have live

999
01:33:56,080 --> 01:34:03,120
concerts and they're going to be showcasing, for the first time, video game music this summer.

1000
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:09,600
So, on August 1st, they're going to have gaming prom from 8Bit to Infinity,

1001
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:15,360
which will be performed at the Royal Albert Hall in London and conducted by Robert Ames.

1002
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,960
That's awesome. Yeah, Jason referenced that in the intro a little bit. And I hope there's a way

1003
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,800
for us to watch it over here, that the content gets on YouTube and isn't region locked or

1004
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:29,440
something. I'd love to see it. I think it'd be pretty great. Just coming off a couple of weeks

1005
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:35,280
ago, seeing the San Francisco Symphony doing the Dear Friends, but the other Final Fantasy concert,

1006
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:41,840
whatever they're calling it now. Distant Worlds, that was it. It's great to see the symphonies

1007
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,920
performing the video game music. Again, it's art. It's a part of our culture. It's what we've grown

1008
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:54,240
up on. Yeah. And then if you are interested in getting some more Animal Crossing music,

1009
01:34:54,240 --> 01:35:02,320
Animal Crossing New Horizons has the original Soundtrack 2 coming out on CD here. Also,

1010
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:09,120
there is going to be a KK Slider vinyl album that's been released or revealed, I guess.

1011
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:18,480
The Soundtrack 2 is set to release in Japan June 22nd and priced at 7,480 yen and apparently

1012
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:27,440
includes 140 tracks across five CDs. And then of course, the vinyl album, which is supposed to be

1013
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:39,200
released November 23rd and priced at 4,620 yen and has 19 songs in all. So 18 KK Slider music

1014
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:44,880
instrumental collection and one bonus track. I wonder if Dark Sakura, I know she loves her KK

1015
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,320
Slider songs. I wonder if she's going to get that vinyl. It seems like something that's up around.

1016
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:53,840
Maybe. I'll have to ask her next week. All right. Well, now let's see what else we can buy this week

1017
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,320
as we travel around the world and check out some release dates. So, Loki, what's coming out in the

1018
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:06,320
US this week? In the US, we have Citizen Sleeper on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1019
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:15,680
Trek the Yomi on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. And honestly, that's it.

1020
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:22,480
Sure. Well, probably part of the reason it's quiet over here is that it's very quiet over

1021
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:26,720
in Japan this week, because if I'm not mistaken, it's Golden Week in Japan, because I've seen some

1022
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:31,280
of the sales starting on the stores in honor of Golden Week. And looking at the release dates,

1023
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:34,960
there is nothing. There's some accessories coming out this week. We don't really talk about those a

1024
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:39,120
lot. There are no games coming out this week in Japan. We don't really get to anything until May

1025
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:45,520
12th on the Switch. When Dead by Daylight gets a release in Japan on the Switch, I think it's a new

1026
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:51,280
compilation on the 12th. But as far as this week goes, nothing in Japan. So play what you already

1027
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:55,600
got. Get caught up in your backlog. How about the UK, Loki? I imagine it's pretty slow.

1028
01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:00,320
The UK, they're just getting Sifu on PlayStation.

1029
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:07,360
So all right. So a holiday week in Japan kind of slows down the gaming industry around the world.

1030
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:11,440
But it's understandable, especially with a lot of games. Well, a lot of games from April. Yeah,

1031
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:17,680
April, May is usually pretty dead anyway. So it's not not surprised. It is. Just because at this

1032
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:22,240
point, companies are going to hold their games until school's out. And we have well to play

1033
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:27,520
through games. So yeah, typically a lot of the stuff gets held until it used to be like June

1034
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:34,080
would be kind of a little bit of a release window and then dead for July for sure. July is like an

1035
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:39,200
absolute dead month. August is kind of like let's jump into the fourth quarter in the third quarter.

1036
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:45,040
And then it just ramps up from there until December. All right. We have a few more stories

1037
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:50,000
for you. And then we're going to take your calls and your emails and your other participation in

1038
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,640
our listener roundtable. If you want to give us a call, join our discord. You can also talk with us

1039
01:37:54,640 --> 01:38:00,000
throughout the week on discord over at vog network.com. That's vognetwork.com slash discord.

1040
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,120
If you want to call into the show, you want to head on over to the green room and we will be

1041
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:07,520
pulling people in. But we'll get to that a little later. For now we have some headlines. Loki.

1042
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,960
Yeah, let's talk about Twitch. The Twitch is looking to make some more money because they

1043
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:18,960
apparently they are not making enough money. So they are considering some major changes to their

1044
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:24,960
monetization practices, none of which actually benefit the streamers, unfortunately. So right

1045
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:34,000
now, Twitch is looking to propose a cut to, I guess, certain partnered streamers from normally,

1046
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:40,800
I guess they get 70% of the revenue from Twitch subscriptions. It's going to be dropped down to

1047
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:48,640
50%, which is what affiliates make. Also, they're going to be doing some things to

1048
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:57,840
um, I don't know if it's incentivize more ads to be played. Not really sure what that necessarily

1049
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:06,880
means. And they're going to have a new tier system for partnered streamers as well. So yeah,

1050
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:12,080
I don't know a lot of stuff is contractual stuff that I don't have anything to really do. Yeah,

1051
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:18,320
so incentives for more ads, no more exclusivity, which I guess is all right. So no longer will they

1052
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:22,000
force you to only stream on Twitch, you can actually stream on other platforms.

1053
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:29,680
Let's be real, there are a lot of we're very good, you know, folks here at VOG, where we don't,

1054
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:36,640
you know, put this show up on YouTube immediately after it's broadcast here on Twitch. But there's

1055
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:41,600
a lot of people that do things like that. And they're just like, well, you know, it's what

1056
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,360
Twitch isn't going to find out. And Twitch never does find out. But technically, you are in

1057
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:50,640
violation of your contract. So maybe, you know, Twitch realizes they can't enforce this. So why

1058
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:59,920
not make it a perk? Yeah, so I don't know. It's just, it kind of sucks that they're going to be

1059
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:04,960
doing a lot of stuff. And of course, it's not been taken positive at all by anybody, I think

1060
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:09,440
it's because it's literally taking away people's income. But but you know, what are you going to

1061
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:14,880
do? Because it's, you know, something's got to give if Twitch doesn't make money, then the

1062
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:20,880
platform disappears. And then people are up shit Creek. Oh, yes. Because Amazon doesn't make enough

1063
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:26,160
money. My well, my advice to full time streamers is you better have a plan for if Twitch closes

1064
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:32,000
tomorrow. Like that's my honest advice. You better have a plan for if Twitch closes tomorrow.

1065
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:37,680
What are you gonna do? I don't even know here at VOG network, what do we do? I have an idea what we

1066
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:44,880
do. But uh, you know, there's, there's pretty easy, you just do it on YouTube, or it always

1067
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:49,920
go back to doing it on shoutcast. So but I don't know, I don't know, we don't really have an answer

1068
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:54,880
yet. But you need to, you know, if but we also don't make a lot of money off this we don't make,

1069
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:59,280
in fact, we doesn't really pay any of our, our personal bills. We don't make any money

1070
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:04,480
personally from this. It pays for VOG to be a legitimate business. And it pays for once in a

1071
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:14,320
while, some nice sponsorships and conventions and things like that. So yeah. Anyway, um, so I,

1072
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:18,080
you know, Twitch is obviously in this situation where they're not making as much money as Amazon,

1073
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:24,960
the big Amazon feels like they should. It's leading this tricky situation, I suppose.

1074
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:32,720
So yeah. We'll see. All right. I wonder if I wonder if they aren't gonna,

1075
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:38,640
I would think they're gonna start to gate up how long it takes to get to affiliate.

1076
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:44,960
That's my honest advice. If you think you might want to become a Twitch affiliate at some point,

1077
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:49,440
I would really encourage you to start that process sooner rather than later.

1078
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:54,400
But let's be honest, though, like, there's there's nothing stopping them from taking affiliate

1079
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:59,280
status away from you. There really isn't look at YouTube. I mean, YouTube, I used to be able to

1080
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:06,160
make ad money off of like my channel. And now it's like, no, yeah, no, totally fair point.

1081
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:15,440
So we'll see what happens. All right. Moving on. Next story. Also look, yes, Disney is or I should

1082
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:23,200
say Gameloft is releasing a new Disney game called Disney dreamlight Valley, which looks kind of like

1083
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:30,320
a cross between Animal Crossing and say like The Sims with like a bunch of Disney stuff thrown in.

1084
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:39,600
It is a free to play game that is going to be on console and PC. And it'll be launching in 2023.

1085
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,520
It's all I mean, it looks all right. I know there's some people that probably be into this,

1086
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:52,480
but I get really wary when it's a Gameloft title. And I could just see monetization

1087
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:56,080
out the ass for this. Yeah, it's one of those things where it's like it has the potential

1088
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:01,360
to be really good. There's a lot of good things in that formula. But it's one of those we really

1089
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:04,960
can't pass judgment on it until we can actually play it because it's one of those things that can

1090
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:10,960
go many directions. It could really be surprising. It could really be a cash cow that just, you know,

1091
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:18,160
leaves cow patties everywhere. So we'll see. Yeah, it looks neat, though, as long as it's

1092
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:24,320
awesome. I would prefer this was more like a Disney Infinity type game. And that's almost

1093
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:30,640
kind of the vibe I got from some of that stuff. But it's a free to play game. Like just make a

1094
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:35,120
console game. Like, why is it so hard that we can't just like, like, honestly, like, imagine

1095
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:39,440
like, if they made just like an Animal Crossing game, just like they can even sell DLC for like

1096
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:44,400
different things like Oh, hey, you want like, you know, the Nightmare Before Christmas stuff. Now

1097
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:47,600
we'll send and sell you a Nightmare Before Christmas thing and they could like piecemeal

1098
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:52,800
it out that way. Instead of it being free. I just whatever.

1099
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:58,800
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says serious Disney fans are

1100
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:07,760
a different breed and will either love this or be shit on. Yes. Very that. Another story next also

1101
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:16,240
from Loki. So Bungie has unfortunately kind of received a little bit of a loss when it came to

1102
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:24,240
going after cheat sellers. For destiny to they apparently were going after the website aim junkie

1103
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:33,840
saying that they were in violation of copyright infringement. But apparently the judge did not

1104
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:46,080
feel that way. So they have dismissed the claims for the copyright was the non trade, I guess

1105
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:50,960
trademark really claims they've dismissed that they said that the non trademark really claims

1106
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:58,400
should skip the court and be resolved via arbitration. But apparently, though, the aim

1107
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:04,480
junkies I guess and they have the legal team have dismissed the copyright infringement claims saying

1108
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:09,600
that, you know, they haven't actually copied anything. Because they're kind of just like

1109
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:17,120
circumventing their cheat software or something like that. So that means that makes sense that

1110
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:21,120
they wouldn't get them on that. But I still think in the end, they're probably, you know,

1111
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:25,840
bungees got a lot more money when it comes to lawyers, I would think so they probably gonna

1112
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,760
end up getting them on the other stuff. We'll just see what happens on appeal because that's

1113
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:36,240
how these things always go. Right. Exactly. Yeah. All right, stay tuned. Something else you might

1114
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:42,640
want to stay tuned for if you're a roblox player is a performance from Lizzo, who's pretty amazing

1115
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:48,560
and has a new album coming out. Lizzo is going to be doing a concert in the metaverse on April 30.

1116
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:56,320
I mean, here's the end. This is no disrespect to Lizzo. She's she's great. But this whole thing

1117
01:45:56,320 --> 01:46:00,880
is being hyped up. It's like, oh, it's a concert in the meta. Hasn't Fortnite been doing concerts?

1118
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:08,000
I mean, I know Fortnite isn't technically the metaverse. But isn't it kind of like that? I

1119
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,760
don't get it. They've already done concerts before in Roblox too, I want to say. Yeah, it's weird.

1120
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:20,320
Anyway, Logitech is doing Oh, maybe this is it. Logitech says it's the first music award show in

1121
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:27,600
the metaverse. It's the song breaker awards and Lizzo will be doing her first virtual performance

1122
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:35,120
in this music award show calling it the metaverse. Jesus Christ, it's just a game call it VR chat.

1123
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:39,840
That's what it is. It's like just like it's just like, oh, let's use the buzzword buzzword the

1124
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:45,600
blockchain metaverse pass. Give us money now. Money, money. I'm gonna tell you this much,

1125
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:50,560
you know, you can throw up the word metaverse all you want for Roblox. But like their stock

1126
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:55,920
prices aren't doing as good as they used to like that stuff that launched at like 80 bucks a share

1127
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:03,200
and it's down to like 50 I think so. Yeah, it ain't sell anybody on the metaverse stuff.

1128
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:07,760
Questbuster says Hatsune Miku concerts have been a thing in PlayStation Home Japan.

1129
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:15,200
That's pretty cool. No, it's Zen monkey. It's not in VR chat. It's in Roblox. I was just calling it

1130
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:19,920
VR chat because that's what the metaverse is. The metaverse is just VR chat under a different name.

1131
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:25,680
That's all it is. I don't just it's a really bad word that they're gonna beat it to death. Like

1132
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:33,280
it's just like I'm so sick of hearing about metaverse. Like it's just it's so dumb. Yeah.

1133
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:40,880
All right. Well, that's it for the stories that we had on deck for tonight. So we invite you to

1134
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:45,920
give us a call if you'd like over in our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

1135
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:52,720
We also have our mailbag, which I will get to here in a moment. While I open up the mailbag,

1136
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:55,600
Loki, is there any other headlines we missed tonight that you want to talk about?

1137
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:00,560
Not really.

1138
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:06,160
We have one email. So we have something for tonight. We have an email. YYR has been

1139
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:11,760
emailing us a lot, but I surely don't mind. I always enjoy hearing from YYR. So we have

1140
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:17,600
this email tonight from YYR saying hello, LR. Just a note on something you mentioned in last week's

1141
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:23,360
episode. Sonic Origins will be releasing this month. However, if all you want are the original

1142
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:29,360
games at a reasonable price without the scummy DLC, you should know that the original Xbox 360

1143
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:35,360
versions of Sonic one, two, three and Knuckles, as well as Sonic CD are still currently available for

1144
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:42,000
$5 each via backwards compatibility on Xbox one and series consoles. And if you buy Sonic and

1145
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:47,200
Knuckles, you can use the lock on feature with any of Sonic one through three if you also purchase

1146
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:51,840
those. However, if this sounds like a good alternative to you, you probably shouldn't

1147
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:55,920
wait too long to jump on it. This may have been mentioned during the show already. No,

1148
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:01,280
I was saving it for this actually. I read ahead tonight. But all of those titles are about to be

1149
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:07,840
delisted on May 20th. Just saying. It just really irritates me that they want to charge so much for

1150
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:12,320
these games now, especially considering that they're also adding the sorts of things we get,

1151
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:18,960
we used to get for free in these collections as paid DLC. Just stop. Anyway, thanks again for the

1152
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:25,120
show and enjoy your week. Happy to save a buck here and there. Aaron or yyr and I'm going to add

1153
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:31,120
a PS that he didn't write but I'm putting it there. PS by falling plus on Xbox now. It's

1154
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:35,680
available. Oh, I got the number one score and falling was I haven't checked to see if it's

1155
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:41,280
still there. I should I if anyone dethrone me it was this issue 100 Matt, but I got the number one

1156
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:45,840
score and falling plus at some point. Oh, do you take it back? All right, Matt took it back. I just

1157
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:55,760
haven't logged in to look at it. So I guess I got to play again. But yeah, so check out falling

1158
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:00,240
plus on Xbox if you want to get in our pissing match over a high score in that game. But that's

1159
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:07,440
been fun. Bobby Black Wolf and chat says I had it. You did. You had it for a moment.

1160
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:16,240
As soon as Matt says buy the game and dethrone me please. Yes, dethrone us both. Um, so anyway,

1161
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:22,720
back to the point in Aaron's email about the games being delisted. Yeah. Um, they never did put them

1162
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:29,200
out like I would have thought for sure there was a compilation on CD. But I guess, or DVD or

1163
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:37,920
whatever of those Sonic games. I guess there wasn't. But um, what is that called? I'm looking

1164
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:42,720
up right now. Was it the Sonic mega collection? Well, there's that that's available on GameCube,

1165
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:49,280
and that has everything. But what was the mega Genesis?

1166
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:54,400
Yeah, it was something like something Genesis collection. I don't remember what it's called.

1167
01:50:54,400 --> 01:51:01,120
Sorry for the silence. But I'm trying to remember what this is called.

1168
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:07,360
Like ultimate Genesis or Sonic. It's just called the Sega Genesis collection. Okay,

1169
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:13,200
that's that's what I'm looking for. Or Sega Genesis classics. So let me look Sega

1170
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:23,360
Genesis classics ps4 game list. So if you pick up this Sega Genesis classics,

1171
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:32,160
on ps4, it has Sonic and Sonic two, it just doesn't have Sonic three.

1172
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:40,960
But it has 3d blast and spinball in it as well. So and I think that I remember it coming up that

1173
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:47,760
maybe the music with Sonic three has been an issue in the past. But yeah. So anyway, also pointing

1174
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:52,320
out the Sonic ultimate Genesis collection didn't have the lock on feature. Oh, is that the one on

1175
01:51:52,320 --> 01:52:02,480
ps3? Sorry, I'm looking up things live as we're going. Okay, yeah, the Sonic ultimate Genesis

1176
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:09,040
collection was the one that was on ps3 and Xbox 360. And that has one, two and three.

1177
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:18,480
And it has Sonic and Knuckles. So I bet you could find that game used pretty cheap right now until

1178
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:23,360
people realize it's true value that it has all those Sonic games in it. I think I have this on

1179
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:28,160
PlayStation three hanging out around somewhere. It's a bummer. I can't fucking play PlayStation

1180
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:36,880
three games on my ps4 or PlayStation five. So you can play some of them, but you have to buy

1181
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,200
them again. Well, and this one won't be one that you can buy again, I guarantee it why would Sega

1182
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:45,360
put that out when they've got this other Sonic thing they want people to buy now. So I would

1183
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:52,480
the Xbox 360 version of this is really the must have thing I would say. Oh, de drama as says you

1184
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:56,880
got a PS five No, not yet. I'm speaking out of turn a little bit. It's just that with Final

1185
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:03,120
Fantasy 16 likely releasing in the next year. It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of you know,

1186
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:08,160
when I finally tell call call Shane and say, Shane, I need you to work your target inventory

1187
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:15,840
magic and make me get a PS five. So Oh, Bobby Blackwell says it's not backwards compatible on

1188
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:24,880
Xbox one. Oh, sneaky sneaky. So you really just have to have a 360 to play this. Interesting.

1189
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:28,800
Greedy, greedy, greedy.

1190
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:37,040
Aren't I guess I'll just the wide graphic thing really worth that much. And and why no Sonic four

1191
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:44,800
as if I had to ask. It wasn't good. But why no Sonic for my then why not just throw it in.

1192
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:53,600
Anyway. All right. Uh, that is gonna do it for another episode of orange launch radio. Thank you

1193
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:59,920
so much for tuning into our show and supporting the show. Whether you were here live over at

1194
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:04,320
twitch.tv slash a vog network on Sunday night, or you were listening on our podcast three feed

1195
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:09,600
throughout the week. Thank you so much for supporting our show. As Jonah Matt says the

1196
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:17,280
Sonic four is a DLC that's going to be another $30. Yeah. And did your MS says retail stores

1197
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:22,960
can get them in stock for 24 hours now. Yeah, I think we've heard rumblings that the chip shortage

1198
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:29,200
is on its way out. And just most people who wanted a PS five that badly have finally gotten one by

1199
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:34,160
now. So it's, you know, just don't support the resellers. That's the most important thing.

1200
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:39,440
Anyway, where was I? Yes, if you enjoyed the show, help us spread the word. We are the show where

1201
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:44,160
every gamer has a voice but we need more voices here to put out on air. A nice five star review

1202
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:48,880
on a site site like iTunes or Spotify or Google, whatever, wherever you found this podcast,

1203
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:53,280
give it a rating and a nice review. Believe me, it goes a long way. I don't think anyone's written

1204
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:58,400
an iTunes review for the show in like three years. So if you haven't written written one yet,

1205
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:04,640
we'd really appreciate it. Thank you. That's that's all I can think of. Join our discussions

1206
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:10,720
throughout the week at vognetwork.com slash discord. I guess that's it. That's all I've got

1207
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:15,600
to say. Let's go around and get final thoughts. Loki, what's your final thought for this week?

1208
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:24,880
I gotta go play more Minecraft. I'll try to play something else to 200,000 blocks you amateur go

1209
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:31,200
for 300,000 next time. I know I need to prove your love of Minecraft because I'm doubting you

1210
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:37,440
right now. You're right. I gotta prove everybody. My final thought I'll just give a cheap plug to

1211
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:41,280
my personal Twitch channel over at Rob Roberts because we've had some fun Final Fantasy 14

1212
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:47,200
streams. I've almost hit two of the three criteria to be a partner. If I stream tomorrow,

1213
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:53,040
which I probably will unless I have an IRL thing come up, I will have the 25 hours and I will have

1214
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:57,360
the whatever it is however many streams you need in a month 12 or something like that. I will have

1215
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:03,280
both of those. I just won't have the 75 average viewers. So I'm a little ways away from that. But

1216
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:11,120
hey, every every view counts. Thank you over at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, my personal channel.

1217
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:15,680
And of course twitch.tv slash vog network is where you can find us live on Sunday nights.

1218
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:19,520
And I see that we just got a hype train here at the end of the show. Thank you. Thank you. Thank

1219
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:24,000
you. I'll give you all your credits here after the credits. But let's get to those credits. We'll

1220
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,160
see you in seven days. Hopefully the gang's all back together next week because it will literally

1221
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:32,800
have been a month. But we're excited to have Dark Soccer Loki and myself all together again in a

1222
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:39,840
week. Have a great night everybody. We'll see you next time. Good night. You've been listening to
