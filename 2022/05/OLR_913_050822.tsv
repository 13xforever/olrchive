0	13240	I know I heard about the 24-karat gold-plated Wii made for the Queen of England, but today
13240	16760	I learned that she wasn't allowed to receive it. It's a highly coveted console due literally
16760	20600	to its precious metal, slightly limited playability since Wii's online services have been shut
20600	25040	down, but was otherwise a relic of a successful machine with an ecosystem that is still rich.
25040	28000	Like you would have to be to win the auction for it. Jeez!
28000	31720	This is another sliver of THQ history. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie
31720	35080	Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35080	37160	Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37160	44760	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
44760	51760	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode
51760	59880	number 913 of our show for tonight, May the 8th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and joining
59880	62640	me as he always does say hello to Techmaster Loki.
62640	63640	Hello.
63640	65560	Hey, Loki, how are you?
65560	66560	I'm doing good.
66560	70680	Good. What's new with you?
70680	76520	Not much other than, you know, just Minecraft stuff.
76520	79360	Do we have a new video to look forward to?
79360	86440	Yeah. And having having bad luck with trying to find things to do today because I was trying
86440	91800	to go roller skate or rollerblading again. And like two of the rinks were closed. One
91800	96920	was closed due to some speed skating competition. One just changes their their hours. They're
96920	101280	like, OK, let's go have pizza at this one place. That place was closed because I guess
101280	104960	they were short staffed. They were like, OK, let's go play mini golf. Then it started hailing.
104960	106840	I was like, OK, I'm going home.
107360	113440	Oh, yeah. The weather was very strange today. It was very like, I'm going to be sunny. No,
113440	116560	I'm going to rain. No, I'm good because I was out walking and that was an adventure.
116560	122160	Let me tell you. So I'm also joining us tonight. Say hello to Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.
122960	123560	Hi.
123560	127360	Hi. I wasn't sure if you were going to be here or not. I thought you were going to sit out,
127360	128880	but that's all right. I'm glad to have you.
128880	136320	I was going to, but I figured I'll try. You know, headaches are weird. The moment that
136360	140680	I took off my headset, like it was instant feeling better. So.
143480	147720	I'll push through it. I'm medicated. I have drugs in my body.
148520	152760	Hooray. Always, always nice to have. Well, it's good to have the gang all together. I'm
152760	159000	glad you're here. But if the migraine headache thing becomes too much, just let us know and
159000	164840	we'll continue on the show. We'll continue. I'll be here for for at least the first story.
164880	169520	I just want to, you know, hang out and be with everybody for a little bit. Just, you know,
170080	175040	I missed last week and I don't want to miss too much of this week. I'd rather, you know,
175040	178400	at least, at least spend some time with everybody before I throw in the towel.
178960	183280	Makes sense. Well, great to see you. Sorry to hear you're not feeling well, but
183840	187120	your makeup is great. I know you, I know you need to, if you're going to take the time to
187120	192720	do your makeup, you got to go. You got to show up. I'll tell you what, my makeup is pretty half
192720	197360	fast. I did it in five minutes. All right. And honestly, I'm actually still
197360	204720	wearing my pajamas. I just put on a bra. Well, do you see what you're missing? Not
204720	208160	being here live because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,
208160	211520	nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black will show at the voice of geeks network,
211520	219440	twitch.tv slash vog network. And yeah, you can follow us along as we tape live on Sunday nights
219440	224720	and you can participate in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network. But of course,
224720	230320	if you want, you can also listen to our podcast. We're available at places like iTunes, Spotify,
230320	234720	and wherever a fantastic podcast can be found. And there's a lot of love for you in the chat,
234720	240160	dark Sakura, a DJ Rama S in response to you talking about your dressing habits.
240160	247280	Say this is why we stand Jamie go queen. And I'll be perfectly honest. This is also my work
247280	252880	attire when I'm not in the office. Yeah. I think honestly it's, if I don't have to be on zoom,
253600	258880	I'm probably not even wearing a shirt. I've attended many an online training with my big
258880	264560	fuzzy bathrobe and no one bats an eye because we're all doing it.
266560	270160	As she went under, Matt says, you do you Jamie feel better. Absolutely.
270160	275200	I appreciate that. And that's my intention. I just wanted to be on for a little bit, you know,
275200	279120	say hi to everybody before I do a bow out. So, right.
279120	285120	Well, let's get to our kickoff story tonight. It's a big one. In fact, actually this news happened
285120	290400	like right after OLR last week. It was interesting cause it was kind of the middle of the night when
290400	296960	this news broke. But it actually was prime time in Europe. So it was Monday morning in Europe.
296960	301840	So we heard about this at what, like 11 o'clock at night because that's when the workday was
301840	305520	starting over in Europe. Loki, you don't want to get into this big, big acquisition in the
305520	312160	gaming industry, right? Yeah. So the Embracer group is purchasing Crystal Dynamics,
313040	319920	Eidos Montreal and Square Enix Montreal for 300 million, which is actually pretty
320640	327600	cheap considering some of the acquisitions we've had recently. That includes of course several,
327600	333840	you know, big IPs, of course, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, Legacy of Kain and of course
333840	339440	a back catalog of about 50 games. It also takes Avengers with it too, doesn't it?
339440	345440	Sort of. Technically the game is sort of there, but the license is really, and Disney licensed
345440	351040	that to Square Enix. So technically, no, they would have to get permission from Disney to move
351040	356400	that license. They'd have to buy the source code. There's kind of question if it's worth it,
356400	361520	I hate to say, because of the Avengers game not really performing at the level they were hoping.
362560	367200	It's a good game though. Yeah. You know, especially I hear it's in a pretty decent
367200	371040	place at this point from where it was at launch, but it's just one of those things where for
371040	375200	whatever reason, yeah, it just, it didn't get us. Did they also do Guardians of the Galaxy or was
375200	380640	that a different group? No, that was. It wasn't Crystal Deep. It was Eidos.
381600	388080	Yeah. So yeah, they technically get that game, but again, the IP intellectual property is still
388080	395520	Disney's to dole out. I'm more referring to the code. Yeah. So, well, the code for the game,
395520	402080	I guess technically would go to Embracer, but they can't do anything with it besides the game
402080	408960	that's already out unless they go to Disney and renegotiate that basically. Yeah. I'm sure they've
408960	413760	got stuff worked in their contracts and everything, but yeah, Guardians was a great game. I didn't get
413760	419840	to play it cause it won't run through steam on my Mac, but I've watched the entire thing.
420400	425280	Yeah. Guardians seemed to be much better received than Avengers, at least at launch. Cause I think
425280	431120	what's interesting is that the bar was very high for Avengers. It didn't meet that bar well for
431120	436240	many, I should say. And I have, I have no horse in this race. I am not huge on Marvel. Like a lot of
436240	441280	people, I don't hate it by any means. I just it's, it's there and I appreciate it and I, you know,
441280	445200	golf clap it, but I don't, I don't rabidly follow it or anything. I didn't see that new movie that
445200	452560	came out this weekend. I'm afraid to, but because yeah, I've I've it's see most Marvel movies and
452560	457840	they come out. I hear nothing but great things. This one, very polarizing, very polarizing.
457840	463120	The thing is, is that I've, people have just have compared it to drag me to hell, which I hate drag
463120	469840	me to hell with an unholy passion. I love Sam Raimi movies. I hated that one. That was like
469840	476080	one of the last movies I've walked out of just absolutely like, why the fuck did I waste my time?
477360	482160	I'm trying not to make these two movies fight, but I can't help it. I already saw the best
482160	485520	multiverse movie of the year. Cause I saw everything everywhere all at once.
485520	491120	So I want to see that. Well, and my, my other thing is that I'm tired of the trope of
491680	497360	woman in grief with lots of power goes crazy. So just a boring trope.
497360	503120	Um, but anyway, where were we? Oh yes. The bar for Avengers high for many people not met the
503120	508560	bar for guardians low, because when those trailers and things are coming out, people were like,
508560	513680	Oh, I don't know about this one, but exceeded expectations is very kind of interesting thing.
513680	517680	I think I would say that the bar for guardians was set pretty low. People did not have high
517680	522080	expectations for that game. Um, and I don't know if that's like the Chris Pratt drama
522080	526160	carrying over to the game, even though he has nothing to do with the game. Um, but yeah,
526160	531280	it's well, that and star Lord is by in the comics, which is awesome. Yeah. So anyway,
531280	536240	so my point is, yeah, the guardians thing is also worth money. I would think Tomb Raider alone
536240	541520	should have been worth a pretty penny. So embrace her absolutely got to steal. And if you don't
541520	546640	know who embrace her is, they're basically THQ Nordic. It's a little more nuanced than that,
546640	549920	but I'm just going to tell you the short version is their THQ Nordic.
549920	554240	And they've been buying a lot of stuff. I heard a great comparison on Bobby shows.
554240	558720	Of course we tape live after Bobby black Wolf does here at VOG network. He called it the 10 cent of
558720	564000	Europe. And I think that's a very apt comparison, especially in the last couple of years,
564000	568400	THQ Nordics been, you may not realize this cause you might think like THQ or that, well,
568400	572800	okay. Cause this company, they grabbed the THQ name. They they're grabbing this,
572800	577920	they grabbed a gearbox. They got, they've been grabbing a lot of companies when you haven't
577920	582160	been looking. And some of the IPS they have, I mean, they have the goat simulator,
582160	586320	they have time splitters, borderlands, Dark Siders is going to be there. Yeah.
586960	592880	So this is a pretty big holding now. And now, so this, this is the house that is now going to
594720	600880	Tomb Raider and all these other things, which is wild. I cannot believe Square Enix
601760	606880	sold it for as little as they did. Why did Square Enix hate Tomb Raider so much?
607920	613680	Like I, and, and, and the reason why I say that is it all goes back to, we all know that quote
613680	617120	that, you know, the president of Square Enix said that Tomb Raider had,
617120	622480	did not meet expectations, even though it sold like 6 million copies. And I'm sorry,
622480	626880	but the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy was fucking great. Like it was,
626880	631680	those were some good fucking games. And like, Lara Croft and the no good, very bad day.
631680	640400	Yes. Or I like Alan's name for it. Girl. You remember I made that picture a while back.
640400	643040	Yeah, no, that's, that's what my husband Alan calls it. He calls those games.
643600	649280	Girl. That's cause that's what it is. She, she hits a tree branch. Girl. She dodges lightning
649280	655360	bolts. Girl. That's what it is. She falls down a hole into a sewer. Girl. Yeah.
656320	659280	TigerClawn chat says Square Enix has unrealistic expectations.
660400	665360	Fifth Dream in chat says, notice it's all their Western games, but all the J stuff is still at
665360	671680	Square Enix. Yes. That is also interesting. If we want to talk about unrealistic expectations,
671680	676480	they think they're going to make money with NFTs. I mean, there's some unrealistic expectations.
676480	683040	And now there's that quote going around is that we, we had to sell these so that we could invest
683040	692640	in the blockchain, which I hope they lose everything. Gaming companies. I don't want
692640	698160	them to lose everything. I need my final fantasy series. My father has a 14, my father has a 16
698160	703360	Yoshi P. I need to put him in a bubble. He's a precious angel. I in for the gaming industry,
703360	709200	I need those people protected. I don't want Square Enix to fail. Absolutely not. So I, but I,
709200	715200	I need this NFT thing to them to back off this whole thing. Because again, I don't be,
715200	717680	and I was talking about this a little bit on Bobby's show. I'll say it again.
718400	724560	I view NFTs very similar to the Diablo three real money auction house. And I know that there are
724560	729200	going to be nerds out there that want to correct me saying, well, actually with the difference
729200	735120	between NFTs, would that be NFTs are not centralized and Blizzard ultimately owned
735120	740480	everything that was through the Diablo three auction house. Okay. Yes, I get it.
741120	746400	But here's the thing. A lot of people out there don't understand NFTs. And when they think of
746400	751040	NFTs right now, they see those ugly fucking monkeys that are like the bit, what are they,
751040	756080	what is that? The yacht, eight club or whatever those are. They are ugly. They are more to come
756080	761520	on that ugly fucking monkeys riddled with crime. That is what NFTs are right now.
762080	764960	So if you want this to break into the mainstream,
765840	770800	you've got to convince people what are the, you know, benefits to this.
771600	777680	And I understand that a lot of it, or why I understand that a lot of it to me feels like
778320	784560	amiibo. And yes, I understand amiibos are not unique in nature, but you can load unique things
784560	790160	to them and amiibo. And this is why I say Nintendo is going to be the one that pushes NFTs and gets
790160	795120	it right. Because amiibo, the reason why it works is well, A, the figures are nice, B,
795760	801280	they work in multiple games. And that's, you know, these things, you know, if you can buy content
801280	806160	that really truly works in multiple games, I think it's going to be great. But I think Nintendo is the
806160	810320	only company that's got it all in one roof where people are going to eat it up. I don't think
810320	815840	Square Enix, I mean, maybe with the Final Fantasy franchise, but I don't, God, I don't want them to
815840	823760	see him. It just doesn't make sense for the Final Fantasy franchise. So Bobby Blackwell, to be fair,
823760	829040	saying NFTs technically do not have to be unique. They are just intended to be philosophically.
829040	835920	Look, here's the thing. I, on one hand, I kind of get where the NFT technology is going. A
835920	842240	decentralized Diablo 3 auction house where let's say the swords you get can actually work in all
842240	848240	these other games, too. I kind of get that. I just don't see that realistically working in
848240	854000	our industry for a long time. And I think it's way too early to get into it when right now,
854000	859680	when people hear NFT, they think of fucking crime, they think of spammers, they think of crime,
859680	864080	they think of things to delete and send instantly to the trashcan, because that's what it is on the
864080	868960	internet right now. And if you're a crypto bro, I'm sorry, I'm telling it like it is.
869600	874720	That is what most people, maybe your bubble doesn't view it that way. But most people out
874720	882400	there don't get it. And I'm sorry, but those ugly fucking art pieces of art are not going to sell
882400	889920	it to them. So that's that's my weekly NFT rant. So anyway, so I don't understand why Square Enix
889920	896960	thinks that they've got to get in this right now. I really don't. S2100 Matt says to get on the
896960	902240	ground floor. S2100 Matt says many hardcore NFT folk understand that at some point the market
902240	906560	will drop out. And all of these monkey and other stuff will be worth noting. It's all about cashing
906560	911120	in now. Bobby Blackwell says Square Enix's president says you are in the majority opinion,
911120	917760	but you will change your mind soon. And Bobby, I'm willing to admit, I may change my mind.
918640	922400	And this has been shocking. But you know what's going to do it? It's not going to be a fucking
922400	927520	ugly ass random, randomly clothed monkey. It's not going to be that. You know what's going to
927520	934720	do it? Pokemon. That's when we're going to get into NFTs. And I know right now you don't want
934720	939120	to hear me say it. You don't want to hear me even open up that realm of possibility. But that's I'm
939120	944720	I I will bet money. Nintendo is the only one that's going to make it happen. And when they
944720	953040	make it happen, it happens. So that's that's my opinion. Bobby Blackwell says yes, the goal for
953040	957600	NFT people is for them not to be the last person holding the bag when the market crashes. That's
957600	962880	why they really, really want you to get into it so they can sell you their NFTs. Hence the crime,
962880	967600	the spam, and the no fucking thanks that goes along with all of that right now.
968400	977280	So anyhow, the thing is, is that they need to actually get the true pulse of
979360	986320	the people. You can't create, and I'm saying create and quote fingers, you can't create
986320	994160	something, put it out there. And if people don't want it, you can't force it on them. They're not
994160	1004320	going to, to take something that's forced on them. I mean, and we know the the loudness of
1004320	1012560	our of our community, right? We know the forcefulness when people do not want, right?
1014480	1020240	And we've we've seen what internet campaigns can do. I mean, a lot of people like, oh, that
1020720	1026880	does jack shit. But in truth, major changes have happened because of it,
1027920	1034480	because of really upset people on the internet. And that's what they're, they're not remembering,
1034480	1042560	especially and I mean, a lot of the Japanese companies, the successful ones look outside
1042560	1050240	of Japan. They look at the world pulse on it. They look at where the trends are worldwide,
1050240	1059600	because and not not to be like, oh, America, blah, blah, blah, but really a lot of the world
1059600	1066320	changes. I mean, we are a big country with a lot of people. You know, that you have to do a
1066400	1074800	comparison between what's going on in Japan and America and Europe and find the commonalities.
1075920	1080160	And they're not doing that. They're saying, Oh, no, we think that this is going to be the
1080160	1085200	big thing. And we're going to make this happen. And it's not, it's not going to happen. They're
1085200	1089760	going to lose money on this one. And they're going to say, why the hell did we sell Tomb Raider?
1089760	1098800	In five years, 2027, Nintendo is going to launch Nintendo fun tickets. And with Nintendo fun
1098800	1104800	tickets, you can make a design, and you can sell it and it can be an Animal Crossing shirt. And
1104800	1109600	it's also going to be a design that's on your Pokeballs in your inventory. And it's also going
1109600	1114320	to be something that you can use in the background in Mario maker. And it's also something that sits
1114400	1119520	in your Smash Brothers trophy collection. And when Nintendo fun tickets happen,
1120480	1125760	that's when it'll finally happen. But don't I Nintendo is going to do it.
1126560	1129280	They'll be last to the party for sure. But I'm just
1129280	1132240	But Nintendo has always been very conservative.
1132800	1136080	Nice. Very true. Yes, yes. But that's why I said when they finally get to the party,
1136080	1140800	that's when it's, you know, happening. So but and I don't think Nintendo is going to
1140800	1147760	go to the party, I think Nintendo, as is their way, they're going to have a completely different
1147760	1153840	party, and it's going to have the success and everyone's going to go, why the hell did we not
1153840	1159920	do that? It's like, because Nintendo looks outside the box, and they do have their, you know, I like
1159920	1167920	to say that Nintendo has that ability to look around the corner. You know what I mean? To take
1167920	1174320	a true peek around the corners, where people are just looking in the straight line, they're
1174320	1179120	looking at the wall, they're looking at the path around the wall, you know, straight ahead of them.
1179120	1184720	But Nintendo is looking around to see, well, what's going to come in? I mean, we've always
1184720	1190960	thought them to be very conservative in their approach to technology. You know, they've all
1190960	1197840	like, while their systems haven't been the most powerful in comparison, they've had the most
1198400	1207040	fun, in my opinion, just in general, their games focus on fun, their peripherals focus on fun,
1207040	1214000	they focus on things that are enjoyable. And if they're not going to go the route of the NFT,
1214960	1223280	for for those same reasons that you know, it's it may not be the fun that consumers are looking for.
1223280	1229760	It's just money in the pocket. And we've even seen, they've been willing to take a hit financially,
1230320	1236400	to put out something that's going to be more fun. And in the end, it usually pays off for them. I'm
1236400	1240880	not counting the Wii U, you know, Reggie, and this is another reason why I'm saying even though yes,
1240880	1245200	I know Nintendo is conservative everything. This is one of the reasons I am well, there's two
1245200	1250960	reasons why I'm saying Nintendo with this because number one, I strongly believe Nintendo is the
1250960	1256720	only gaming company I can think of save for maybe Sony and Microsoft first party stuff. But I think
1256720	1262160	Nintendo is stronger than both of those even. Nintendo is the only company with a first party
1262160	1268320	ecosystem strong enough to support the vision we're being promised of NFTs. I don't think any
1268320	1273760	other company out there has the ecosystem of insular titles to support that system is not
1273760	1279520	Square Enix, not after just selling off three of their, you know, big properties, but I digress.
1279520	1284800	The other reason why I bring it up, Reggie's out there right now doing a big book promotional tour,
1284800	1290160	and he's doing a lot of interviews to support the book. I understand Reggie has not represented
1290160	1296160	Nintendo for several years now. However, he's been out there saying, Yeah, I think blockchain,
1296160	1299760	I think blockchain is the future of the industry. I think I think, you know, we're not there yet.
1299760	1303440	But I think that's something we're getting towards. Here's the thing. I really I know.
1303440	1307360	Yes, Reggie has nothing to do with Nintendo anymore. He's not speak for them. I get it.
1309280	1313760	But was he speaking about it a couple years ago? Was this something that intended because you know,
1313760	1317440	these these companies they're looking they're looking far forward. Was it something that
1317440	1320880	maybe they would, you know, he still has friends, he still has people he's talking to.
1320880	1328080	I'm not I just think Nintendo, they know about it, whether they're going to embrace it or not,
1328080	1335520	they certainly know about it. I think that they're going to have their own variant of the thing.
1336160	1344000	Yeah. Like I said, tickets now. Maybe not like that. But like, and I'll tell you,
1344000	1347440	I actually ordered a game on play Asia today and they take crypto.
1348160	1348660	Hmm.
1349360	1356960	Um, I think that the concept is going to evolve into something more stable.
1358960	1361920	Not this decentralized thing. But
1364720	1370320	it's it, I think it's going to be some sort of hybrid, something that can be tracked,
1370400	1378000	something that can be regulated, but still allow a level of anonymity and personal control.
1378800	1383040	You know, something like, you know, like in the movies, like in the future, oh,
1383040	1389680	we pay X credits for something right. You know, where it's not physical money anymore.
1390400	1397360	I think we're going to be down the line going to something like that, if that makes sense.
1397360	1403120	And I think that we'll have a lot more digital property down the line,
1404400	1410560	but I don't think it's going to be exactly the way that the NFT thing is going to be.
1411280	1417120	And I actually agree with fifth dream in here, decentralization, which is touted as
1417120	1421120	it's great feature is the whole reason people get getting ripped off.
1421120	1424080	Yes. I just looked at that comment too. I was like, yep, that's it.
1424160	1429120	If you never do it, I'll tell you why they won't ever do it. Because Nintendo can't stand when
1429120	1437120	their property decreases in value. And NFTs are going to decrease in value, they will never touch
1437120	1442800	it. No, they they I don't think that's the case because they know that their amiibo are going to
1442800	1448880	eventually decrease except for those ones that are like misprints or limited prints. Those might be a
1448880	1453840	different case. And I agree with Jamie in the sense that I don't think Nintendo would allow it
1453840	1457520	to be completely decentralized. I think it'll be the illusion of decentralized.
1460000	1466400	Yeah, I think there's going to be and well, and I also want to point out if you look at history,
1466400	1471280	right? You know, I'm going to go actually back to something I've brought up before
1471280	1478400	the whole labor reform in the US. Remember, those industries were basically privatized,
1478400	1485280	decentralized. owners had control over how the companies work and what happened to their
1485280	1492960	employees, what happened to their investors, you know, eventually, they had to be regulated
1492960	1499680	for the safety and well being of, of the people in general of society in general. And that's
1499680	1504880	actually I think, before too long, we're gonna start seeing legislation to start regulating
1504880	1508400	crypto. Oh, it's it's already happening. Absolutely. I know it's already happening.
1508400	1514800	But but history has been a teacher about what happens when there is no central regulation on
1514800	1521040	an industry. All right. I don't know how we got from the Square Enix stuff to NFT in depth
1521040	1527840	discussion, but it's a good one. So I mean, basically, the whole reason of the the sale
1527840	1535840	was for their NFT market. And I think it's an apt transition is and I think this is something
1535840	1541520	we have to look at because we're hearing it from all angles. This is where the executives want
1541520	1546080	this industry to go. And this is one of the things I we have to look at it whether we like it or not
1546080	1551840	and try to weigh like, what parts of it will work and what parts of it won't work. And I think now
1551840	1556320	for there's a lot that won't work. What do you want to say that they're just trend hopping?
1557120	1562000	They're trend hopping. They're trend hopping. They don't know anything. A lot of these companies
1562000	1565360	have jumped on. They're like, oh, blockchain, blockchain, blockchain. It's like, okay,
1565360	1570880	well, how are you gonna use it? Blockchain, I mean, like, they don't even know what it is.
1570880	1573840	Like, for example, the company I work for is like, super, they're like,
1573840	1575840	blockchain is the future. Like, how are you gonna use it?
1577280	1585040	Yeah, I don't know. I'm like, Bobby, shut up. Remember when VR was the future or 3d TV?
1585920	1592480	I do remember when VR was the future in 1996, when the lawnmower man came out, that was VR.
1592480	1600240	Isn't it interesting that it probably took a good what probably 15 years, probably more 15,
1600240	1608080	17 years after that hole. But when VR is the future, it took 15 to 17 years for where now we
1608080	1616960	have HTC Vive, Oculus, PlayStation VR, and VR is finally catching on a lot more. And in many ways,
1616960	1620960	it's still pretty fresh points to it's still pretty high in many ways.
1620960	1626080	When the price point comes down to where it's affordable, then it'll catch on more right now
1626080	1630320	the price to get into it is too high. But it's coming down.
1630320	1635040	I think at the point that it though becomes mass affordable, no one's gonna care. It won't be
1635920	1638240	the cool elite thing anymore.
1639760	1644240	But it'll be a different type of way of interacting with things. And it all it also
1644240	1649600	depends on like, how to utilize it. Once again, you have Facebook, I'm not calling a meta,
1649600	1654240	you have Facebook trying to like, come up with this like metaverse thing. It's like,
1654240	1660080	okay, well, what's that gonna be for? I don't know. I just want to do it. So we changed our
1660080	1663440	company into meta. It's like, it's stupid. It's like, you don't know why you're doing it.
1663520	1670640	They're doing it to get away from monetization. They're also doing it for their reputation
1670640	1675680	with all those studies that went on about how they're harming LGBTQIA youth, which is one of
1675680	1682640	the big reasons why I quit using Facebook. It's, they're trying to rebrand themselves.
1682640	1689360	That's part of it. But you know, there's a lot of good discussion here in in chat. I mean,
1689360	1695680	Rama brings up a good one. If you follow economic history, he said, I remember when trading foreign
1695680	1700480	currencies was the big thing. I remember, you know, studying back in the 50s, when people
1700480	1705920	wanted to invest in gold bullion, you know, when everyone's like, Oh, invest in gold. It's the
1705920	1713920	thing. You know, it what we're dealing with is a very, I'm going to say mature topic that the
1713920	1719920	younger gamer community isn't necessarily going to be too understanding of. But those of us who
1719920	1725360	have studied history, those of us who are old enough to understand economics, at least to
1726560	1733040	a decent extent, just because we've seen it and been exposed to it, we can compare where our
1733040	1741280	gaming industry is crossing over with economy and compare those histories together, we can see those
1741280	1749840	trends. The thing is, is that I call this executive insanity. That the moment that you
1749840	1757760	go to the executive level, you're so focused on company goal that you stopped seeing the big
1757760	1762880	picture. That's the only company in this industry bolded under you just you just said the biggest
1762880	1768240	problem in the gaming industry. The thing is, is that the companies that are going to be successful,
1768240	1775760	I'm going to even expand this into into tech, in general. I work in the tech industry. So
1776480	1782800	I'm going to leave it at that. But the best companies in general, just in general companies
1782800	1788160	and in general, are the ones who can see around the corners. They're the ones who can see the big
1788160	1794000	picture instead of looking in a straight line. They're going to pull in their analysts from
1794000	1797920	outside sources. They're going to pull in people from diverse backgrounds.
1798800	1803200	And they're going to have the people who say, well, this worked in this industry,
1803200	1808960	this worked in this. I see the parallels here. Why don't we incorporate something new and different
1809600	1814800	and look at this a different way instead of just doing what everybody the fuck else is doing?
1814800	1820240	And that's that's exactly why I think Microsoft, especially in the past five years, specifically
1820240	1825200	the Xbox division is in a place and they're in a great place. And they are a much different
1825200	1828480	company than the one we started talking about 20 years ago when the show started.
1828480	1831840	I think micro because the guy at the top of Microsoft is a gamer who gets it.
1832560	1838480	Also hire me. All right. I'm a really good consultant. I pay attention to shit. I may
1838480	1841760	not have the background in it, but I pay attention to shit and you need me.
1841760	1845280	All right. Well, Dark Soccer, before you go prepare your resume, why don't we get into the
1845280	1849360	next segment about how was your gaming week and what are the types of games that you have been
1849360	1854320	playing this week? So Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week? I played some Dead by Daylight.
1856000	1861360	I played badly because I just, I honestly was just like bullshitting around,
1861360	1866000	you know, trying different builds. I have a very nasty doctor build right now,
1866000	1873760	which is called Fuck Your Gens. Oh, it includes, what did they change mindbreaker to? Fearmonger?
1873760	1882000	Oh, no. Fearmonger. Yeah. Yeah. It's the scourge hook one that causes your gens to pop.
1882560	1886320	Pain Resonance. Yeah. Yeah. Pain, not Pain Resonance. Is it?
1886320	1895200	Yeah. Pain Resonance. It was, it was the Onryo one. Yeah. So, and then it was Merciless Storm,
1896000	1899680	which when your gen is close to being done, you get continuous skill checks.
1900000	1907280	And, um, yeah, it's what, whatever, what was Jolt before Surge? Yeah, something like that.
1907280	1910240	They just changed it from one caffeinated soda to the other.
1911920	1918080	And then I play doctor. I saw it on doctor. I saw a nasty build that combined that Onryo perk,
1918080	1924960	the, um, the 90% Merciless Storm, it combined that with, um, the Huntress's skill check one.
1925680	1931680	That was, that was disgusting. Yeah. I don't have that unlocked on doctor yet,
1931680	1938240	cause I'm still working on getting everybody prestige. Um, I'm close to having Legion on their
1938240	1946080	next prestige level and the changes for Legion. Oh, they're godly. I mean, I played like a potato,
1946080	1951920	but I still had fun because like mixing the, their mix tapes. Yeah. The chase music is so good now.
1952720	1958880	Like, I love it. Also, did you hear that they're, um, they're taking ghost,
1958880	1962000	they're changing ghost faces music because everyone hates it.
1963520	1967360	And there's the, the leak, the D the DBD leak right now.
1968480	1972800	Apparently the next killer and survivor have leaked because they accidentally put it on the
1972800	1980000	public test realm. And so somebody got it. And on top of that, there also is information out
1980000	1986160	that they're doing an expanded secondary resident evil chapter. And so who's the new,
1986160	1993600	that is going to bring in, uh, Ada long, Rebecca, um, Ada long and Rebecca chambers as a survivor
1993600	1998880	and Wesker as a killer. I knew it had to be Wesker. That's Oh, I didn't hear that. That's
1998880	2003920	supposed to be chapter 25. That sounds like fanfic, but at the same time, God, do I want
2003920	2009920	that? I would love to play from DBD leaks and from the same person that leaked the dredge stuff.
2010400	2016720	Wow. And then chapter 26 is supposed to be an unknown survivor and a killer called the night.
2018960	2024400	That's in can, you know, like really should have, it should have been night, man.
2025280	2031120	Well, the dredge is the, the, the one that leaked for this upcoming chapter is, uh, is, uh,
2031120	2036240	N I G H T powered thing. Like his whole thing is putting the survivors in total darkness and
2036240	2042000	basically, uh, transporting around the map and lockers so that a survivor can open the locker
2042000	2047520	and the killers inside it. And that does sound pretty awesome actually. And on that PT, we miss,
2047520	2053680	we miss the joke. I was saying that you should have night night, man, and then Charlie. Yeah.
2053680	2060800	Okay. All right. Sorry. I'm slow to the party. They also on the PTB, there are new, uh,
2060800	2066720	RuPaul's drag station. I'm sorry. RuPaul's police station, Raccoon city. Um, that will have map
2066720	2073600	variants the way Badham does. Interesting. Changing the layout of like, and I'm looking
2073600	2079920	at the picture. It's all like covered in the goo and littered and there's like new assets listed
2079920	2085680	on it just means I should have downloaded. I usually keep updating the PTB so I can get the
2085680	2090320	assets from it. That's actually how I have ripped everything from Hawkins while it was still in the
2090320	2101920	game. Um, but there's also, um, just all kinds of stuff in there. Um, and DBD leaks has been
2101920	2108400	very reliable. There's been a few times they've been off base, but they've been reliable about
2108400	2113520	it. You know what I mean? Um, can I say S2100 Matt in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says,
2113520	2120400	so no Baba Duke. Um, no, but pride month is next month. And so, you know, we, we already got the
2120400	2126480	whole like, Hey, guess what? David's gay. And here's the progress pride flag. Uh, introducing
2126480	2131120	the Baba Duke as a killer would be a great pride month announcement, but I just, I don't think it's
2131120	2137600	happening. Sorry to say. And I actually watched a really good interview where they said at behavior
2137600	2147360	that they work on something like another six to 10 chapters in advance where they buy the IPs and
2147360	2154640	start their work on it and incorporate feedback from the community. And so, I mean, and you see
2154640	2158080	how well they work with some of the bigger streamers with the community. And I didn't mean
2158080	2163280	to turn my, my gaming week into dead by daylight news, but this is pretty big stuff. Yeah. No,
2163280	2167120	if you're into dead by daylight. And I just want to say, I mean, like, even though the Baba Duke
2167120	2172000	might be gay rights, like nothing would scream gay rights in dead by daylight, like adding
2172000	2176240	Toni Collette from Hereditary as a character. So I'm just I'm just saying that because Toni
2176240	2183760	Collette is gay rights. Just saying. The thing is, is that like, how would would
2183760	2188960	it would killer be her son? She she'd be both a survivor and a killer.
2188960	2199200	Well, there's also another thing going out. This is a rumor mind. Okay. But you know how
2199200	2205040	when Legion was supposed to come out, they were supposed to be like, their original intent was
2205040	2213040	to be a survivor disguise. Where you didn't know that they were the killer. And of course, that
2213040	2223520	didn't work. Which is VHS's whole thing. Yeah, yeah. But the but the other thing, though, is
2223520	2233920	that there's rumor about having like a shape shifting killer that can disguise as one of the
2233920	2241600	survivors in game. Interesting. I think it would be an interesting mechanic. But it's still like
2241600	2246960	vague rumor at this point. All right. So other games I've played. Yes, yes.
2246960	2251360	I beat Seiken Densetsu 3. Oh, congrats. I was watching your stream the other night. You were
2251360	2255440	you were stuck on this part for a bit. You were getting really frustrated.
2255440	2264240	Yeah, it was. It was the mana, the mana sanctuary. It's got some they changed the path the pathing
2264240	2270800	to get back to the mana tree for when the mana tree is dead. Sorry, spoiler for a 25 year old
2270800	2279040	game. But um, but I got to it. I beat the game. I did screen caps at the ending. It was it was
2279040	2286320	perfect. But I do have the poll up because I said I'm always going to do it in a poll even though
2286320	2294880	I'm positive that Terra Enigma is going to win. It's in the lead right now. But there's like two
2294880	2300000	more days left on the voting. And I'll put up I'll put it in in our chat.
2300000	2304640	I was gonna say I have not seen your tweet but I was I was hosting a show last night. So
2304640	2308560	I missed a lot of Twitter stuff. But I'm there's two days left on it.
2308560	2310880	I'm going to vote in your poll right now for Terra Enigma.
2311840	2320080	Yeah, so um, here, I'll go ahead and just paste it in chat. But at any rate, um, the then that
2320080	2325680	means the game after that I'm going to do is is BS Zelda, the stone tablet legend.
2328080	2328960	That's a deep dive.
2328960	2336880	So I have the thing for I've also played because I've been trying to get Saturn games that I own
2336880	2346080	to run on my Mac. And so I played the dome patch for Sega Saturn. And I played some radiant
2346080	2354320	Silver Gun. And I played X-Men Children of the Atom. Nice. So I've been getting my Saturn on.
2356880	2361520	I keep forgetting how hard the dome patch is because I mean, it is a cave game,
2361520	2366400	but I keep forgetting just because I like the dome patch when it starts off, you know.
2369680	2375120	That's it. I'm still looking for a Hikaru emulator that will play Planet Harrier.
2376080	2378240	Let's go to Loki and your gaming week.
2379120	2381520	Uh, it's all been Minecraft, as usual.
2383360	2385760	No magic pen gel like your background.
2385760	2390080	No, no. Sadly, I don't have a PlayStation 2 emulator on my,
2390080	2396800	my PC. Although I mean, I'm sure that'll run like crazy. I did get my Xbox Series X back.
2396800	2400000	So I'm hopefully gonna hook that up and build play something with it.
2400560	2407680	Um, what is it? I played more of my hardcore series this week, so I made good progress in
2407680	2413200	that. Once again, recording too much footage for one episode. I had a struggle to get it down to
2413200	2418480	just the 35 minutes that it was with that, which isn't disappointing because I had a really good
2418480	2424640	ending that I wanted to put in there. But I had like another four hours of footage to cram in
2424640	2430720	there. So it's gonna have to be two episodes. Um, but yeah, I, I ended up going to, well,
2430720	2435440	it'll be in the next episode. I went to the Nether and then immediately left the Nether because it
2435440	2442800	was a horrible place. And I don't want to go there because I'm playing with, you know, um, the 119,
2442800	2451760	um, skulk stuff everywhere. So in it, um, you set off these things that cause like darkness.
2451760	2457440	It's almost like blindness in the game. And so like, as soon as I stepped through the portal,
2457440	2460960	like it was still loading in the world and stuff, there's a gas shooting me.
2461760	2466960	The darkness effect went off twice, which means as soon as I like moved one more time,
2466960	2472160	the warden would spawn. And then I still had a gas. It shot the portal, broke the portal.
2472720	2477760	And so I had to relight the portal real quickly and get back through. I was on fire at the same
2477760	2483280	time. And then I got out and my mind, this isn't a hardcore world. So like I was two and a half
2483280	2489200	hearts away from dying. Um, I don't know how I managed to survive, but I did. And I have it all
2489200	2497040	on, all on, uh, film basically. So that'll be the, the end possibly to the next episode or,
2497040	2499680	you know, somewhere in the middle. I haven't decided yet. I have to see how much footage I
2499680	2505360	have. If I have enough for a full another episode again, but, um, yeah, it was intense. And also
2505360	2510160	because I updated my world from the first experimental snapshot that they put out
2510160	2515280	to the new one, the new one, I mean, obviously they're beta snapshots. They're not done yet.
2515280	2522560	Um, the warden doesn't work quite right because he is spawning in daylight and he's not supposed
2522560	2527520	to do that. And so it made it incredibly dangerous now because before it used to be, okay, well,
2527520	2530880	just don't get caught out in the dark and you can kind of go wherever you want and do stuff.
2530880	2535120	Just be careful of the caves and that type of thing. Now it's like, you're dead everywhere you
2535120	2543840	go. You're just in constant danger. So, um, that was a bit fun to demonstrate, but it made good
2543840	2548400	progress in it and having a lot of fun with it. It's just, I had to be careful because I play it
2548400	2553360	a lot cause it's fun. But then I ended up with like so much footage. Like the last time I played
2553360	2557040	it, for example, was the first three episodes that I put out because there was some more work
2557680	2562640	cause I, cause I had so much footage to go through and it's fine. This is what brings in the views.
2562640	2567920	I got my, my channels up to 370 subscribers now and you know, there's tons of people that come
2567920	2572320	in for that series. So I'm obviously going to keep putting it out, but right now, you know,
2572320	2577760	I've been working on stuff for nerd craft for the next episode. So, um, you know,
2577760	2582880	kind of balanced between those. All right. Uh, my gaming week, honestly, so I was,
2582880	2585920	I had a show last night, so I haven't been gaming a lot this weekend. Um,
2585920	2590960	but as mostly final fantasy 14, um, I wanted to do some streaming this week. I didn't get around
2590960	2595360	to it because honestly, like I was kind of sick this week. Like I just, yeah, I won't get into
2595360	2601280	not like, um, cough sick, but like stomach sick. Um, so, uh, yeah, it just really put me in a
2601280	2604480	bad mood and I didn't really want to stream, uh, at all this week, but it pretty much just
2604480	2609520	play more fancy 14. Like I got my Sage to level 90, so I've maxed another job at 90.
2609520	2613360	Uh, and I'm working on dancer now trying to get that up. So just pretty much my,
2613360	2616800	uh, MMO crack is pretty much all I still play. And then of course,
2616800	2623520	lots of AR games, uh, as long as you're not a dancer in the dark. No, I'm not, uh, Pokemon go
2623520	2629360	and ingress and Pikmin. And today I forgot they were doing like a event day in Pikmin today. It's
2629360	2633760	all about carne. It's not technically community day, but it's like, because it's mother's day.
2633760	2637200	So, you know, happy mother's day to all the moms and motherly figures out there.
2637200	2645440	Um, so, uh, it's carnations, uh, where are the big thing in the game right now? So yeah, so I'll
2645440	2649920	get around to some other games this week. I actually want to try guardians, the galaxy for
2649920	2655120	sure. At some point I still have tunic that like came out almost a month ago that I keep meaning
2655120	2658240	to get into. Cause everybody tells me it's like old school, Zelda, which like one of my favorites.
2658240	2664400	And I got to get into that. Yeah. So I just, you know, too many games, never enough time
2664400	2669520	or when there is time, it's always just MMO crack or I guess I did play a little bit of dead by day
2669520	2674720	life. Only a little bit only. I had some really crappy games and I was like, forget it, forget it.
2675680	2682080	All right. Hey, before I forget what I've got a community thing going on right now, where if,
2682080	2686240	uh, and I'll keep it up until I get the points for it, but I will play a swift.
2687920	2690720	I thought, did I donate points for that? I hope I did. I think I did.
2691440	2697200	It's it's fine, but I might do it a little bit earlier. We'll see. But at this point I am going
2697200	2704080	to go ahead and say goodnight. I'll be in the chat, but my headset's hurting my head. So.
2704080	2710240	All right. Feel better. Thank you. I, and I'm, I'm also not going to stream tonight. So
2710960	2717520	of course, so everyone, as I tell people when I end my own streams, be kind to yourself,
2717520	2722000	be kind to others and go forth and conquer. Sounds good. We'll try our best. All right.
2722000	2727840	Have a good night. All right. Well, we will get into the news at this point. So let's get into
2727840	2734080	our top headline for tonight. Uh, Loki. Yeah. So let's talk more about how Activision sucks
2734080	2743200	and is being sued by more people. So there's been a complaint filed in Delaware, um, asking to see
2743200	2749840	the, uh, financials of Activision Blizzard and also New York city is now suing Activision
2749840	2759680	Blizzard as well. Um, apparently this is because of the, they're saying, uh, was it the fair?
2760240	2764400	It kind of goes along with, I think with the fair employment and housing, um, suit that they had,
2765120	2773200	but, um, this is so long, basically, uh, I think just trying to, with the announced merger,
2773200	2778240	they said, uh, their Kotick will be able to escape liability and accountability entirely
2778240	2782960	and will instead continue to serve in his executive. Um, when the, after the merger
2782960	2788480	closes, um, worse, despite his potential liability for breaches, for fine, uh,
2788480	2796240	financial, uh, duty, the company's board will allow or allowed Kotick himself to negotiate
2796240	2801040	the transaction with Microsoft. The board's decision to entrust Kotick with the negotiation
2801040	2806720	process is inexcusable. And for the additional reason that Kotick stands to personally receive
2806720	2812000	substantial material benefits, whose value is not directly aligned with the mergers price.
2812000	2817600	Basically they're finally in the suit because they're, he is going to make out like a bandit
2817600	2823360	in this whole merger thing. If it goes through and people are not happy with that concern,
2823360	2831040	he is kind of good job, New York city, because fuck Bobby Kotick. He should not get a goddamn
2831040	2835680	thing from what he's done to that company. He's already taken too much. He should pay him back
2835680	2840800	to be quite honest. We know that's never going to happen. So good job, New York city. Get her Jade.
2840800	2849440	That's what I say. I it's yeah. I, I mean, I, I'm not opposed to Microsoft buying Activision
2849440	2854000	blizzard because I know it eventually we'll get Bobby Kotick out of the picture and it'll be in
2854000	2859440	a better place. So this is not an anti-Microsoft cheer. This is 100% an anti Bobby Kotick and no,
2859440	2866560	he shouldn't get a goddamn thing chair. So, um, also deejiram says, this is why you don't fuck
2866560	2870960	with NYC. Well, I thought this was a very similar thing too. I think there were some states that
2870960	2876800	were looking into this and essentially it's because governments invest in companies, um,
2876800	2882960	because a lot of their, um, financial holdings like pension plans, basically pensions for city
2882960	2887040	employees in New York city, as well as state employees in place like California, you know,
2887040	2892560	you name it, these pension plans, investing companies to stay financially sound, to be
2892560	2899040	able to pay out these pensions later, when these companies do dumb things, like promising a payout
2899040	2904640	to an executive who doesn't fucking deserve it. Some of these cities and States look at it as
2904640	2910160	that's money that essentially could be in our pensions, not directly, but it's, it's money
2910160	2914800	that the company is paying out that they shouldn't have to, and it damages the value of the company.
2914800	2918880	So that's why essentially they, at least we know we've had some States that have done that
2918880	2925120	previously. So, um, yeah, bonds 006 says New York state attorney general. She is on her game.
2925120	2935440	Yes. So props, honestly. Um, so I, I'm glad, I'm glad that Bobby Kotick starting to feel the heat
2935440	2939280	a little more because that board sure as fuck didn't hold him accountable. And it's really
2939280	2944400	annoying because that, that board over at Activision blizzard is just as guilty as he is
2945120	2951520	far as I'm concerned. Get rid of them all, get rid of them all, take them out back and
2952640	2955440	buy them tea. Cause I wouldn't say anything else on this show.
2957360	2961120	I am tea and then tell them to leave. All right, let's move on.
2963120	2966880	All right. Let's talk about, I got it. We got, let's talk about summer games Fest.
2966880	2971440	So summer game Fest is, uh, I would say games cause there's more than one game,
2971440	2977280	but it is called summer game Fest. Anyway, summer game Fest live will be kicking off on
2977280	2983520	June 9th, 2022 at two o'clock Easterns. That's 11 o'clock West coast time, our time.
2983520	2988000	And, uh, this is going to be a big, uh, you know, this is the big Jeff Keeley show where
2988000	2992320	there'll be a multitude of different game studios unveiling. Uh, this whole
2992320	2996720	embrace or thing we were talking about earlier in the show, THQ Nordic, they don't do their own
2996720	3003040	press event. So this is a great place to see some of that as an example. Um, and many other places
3003040	3008240	throughout the industry as well. What I think is interesting about this, this is when E3 would
3008240	3013600	have been, this is exactly when E3 would have been. Well, yeah, they probably originally timed it to
3013600	3020640	be around when E3 was supposed to be. Yes, because the digital E3 year, which was last year, it was
3020640	3028400	also timed right around the E3 stuff. So that part I'm, you know, uh, but yeah, uh, it is
3028400	3036560	interesting how I think after E3 kind of said, not this year and Jeff Keeley is, you can see
3037440	3043680	he wants it. He's foaming at the, he wants control of that. And honestly, speaking of,
3043680	3047840	I mean, we're just going across the realm of incompetent people in the industry tonight
3047840	3052160	and the ESA right up there, I mean, right up there with them. So, you know,
3054720	3058160	they're going to send us another email this year saying, Hey, we leaked all your information. Hey,
3058160	3061520	we know there wasn't even E3s here. That's why we're stepping up our game to leak your
3061520	3067920	information all year that we're not even having E3. So we are a tech organization representing
3067920	3075440	the entire industry and we don't have security. We're a very fluid company and all those leaks
3075440	3080800	just flow out of our company and all that data so that everybody can see it. We believe in
3080800	3086480	transparency, but our Alexa rankings that we judge websites and media corporations on our Alexa
3086480	3096720	rankings are secure and trustworthy. Anyway. Oh, where were we? Oh yes. Uh, world premiere.
3096720	3104320	Jeff's favorite phrase in the world. World premiere. World premiere. World premiere.
3105200	3109920	That's going to be all over Summer Games Fest, uh, trailers, news updates for games as well.
3109920	3114480	Cause I'm sure you want to know the latest and wait for that same throw delay. Oh, well I'm
3114480	3117920	when updates I'm saying you want to hear the latest and greatest for like death stranding
3117920	3124960	and you know what Kojima is next. Ooh, do you think? Cause Jeff Keeley is absolutely in bed
3124960	3130640	metaphorically with Hideo Kojima. Do you think Kojima's next title, which is rumored to be the
3130720	3137440	scary game, whether it's silent Hill or not, do you think Summer Game Fest, that should be the
3138320	3144160	scary game cause he represents the scary game. Yeah. Why not? I like games just saying what they
3144160	3148320	are like, let's, let's just put it out there. You know what game this is the scary game.
3149120	3154160	So that would be fun. Also, what I think is interesting with this,
3154960	3161920	you will be able to watch this in IMAX theaters. So you can stream it in the comfort of your own
3161920	3170880	home for free, or you can go catch COVID at your local IMAX theater. Hopefully it's not that
3170880	3175120	dramatic, but why, why would I, why would you go to the theater when you could just watch it? Oh,
3175120	3179280	I don't know. There, there is something to be said about IMAX and seeing something on a big screen,
3179280	3185840	you know, that whole presentation. Um, for example, last night we were doing the lost boys
3185840	3190240	from the eighties on the big screen and now, and I I'd never gotten to see that movie on the big
3190240	3195520	screen. So getting to see that on the big screen, I was like, Oh, this is kind of fun. So anyway,
3196640	3203440	uh, various IMAX locations in the U S Canada and the UK, uh, probably nothing near us though,
3203440	3206800	Loki, unless we want to go to the Metreon in San Francisco, I'm going to just guess.
3206800	3210400	That's not true. They've had it in the past when they've done like the PlayStation stuff.
3210400	3216400	They've been at most of the IMAX is because it's just a, um, they just beam it in, you know, just,
3216400	3221200	it's a satellite feed that they basically just, you know, probably not even a satellite at this
3221200	3229040	point, just internet feed that they just stream in. Uh, let's see, Bobby, Bobby Blackwell says,
3229040	3233600	Jeff should take it to the next level and give out awards at summer game Fest. I mean, why not?
3233600	3239360	Why not? Why not do a more community based award show with some of those things he wants to do?
3239360	3244480	Why not do that show in the summer and then the industry show in the winter? Like you're joking,
3244480	3249440	but like, actually there could be a lot of good stuff by splitting that up a little bit.
3250160	3255200	Anyway. All right. Uh, let's move on to our next story. You want to take this one, Loki?
3255760	3259200	Yeah. I think this is fun. I've been sent this article a lot this week.
3259600	3264960	The, uh, the video games hall of fame has announced their new inductees for this year.
3264960	3269520	And it's very exciting because it's a lot of games that are near and dear to our heart.
3269520	3276880	For example, we've got, uh, the legend of Zelda Ocarina of time, Sid Meier's civilization.
3277680	3281040	Literally my all litter, literally my all-time favorite PC game,
3281600	3283040	literally my all-time favorite PC game.
3283680	3288080	Very, uh, Ms. Pac-man, which I like how it's represented by a TV plug and play thing.
3288400	3292560	Uh, that's hilarious. The machine was a little large for the picture.
3293280	3299680	Yeah. And then of course, dance dance revolution. It's getting it's due finally.
3300880	3304240	Which, um, of course I think most people out there know the history of this show,
3304240	3310640	but if you don't, uh, orange L'Andrea started 20 years ago because Loki dark soccer and myself
3310640	3315360	all met at a local arcade playing dance dance revolution. And for the first two,
3315360	3319440	three years of our show, if you think dark soccer talks a lot about dead by daylight,
3319440	3322560	you should see how much we talked about DDR for years, years.
3323200	3326960	And then finally Konami kind of like stopped release. There's, there's a whole other thing
3326960	3331920	I could get into about how Konami of Japan were idiots. And they want to take risk of releasing
3331920	3338240	new DDR games out here. And it's only because of one person at Konami over here that we ever got
3338240	3343440	it in the U S but anyway, I digress. Uh, we just went so long without content.
3343440	3346720	It was like, well, I guess we should talk about other video games too, cause there's no new DDR,
3347600	3352000	but it's really exciting to see DDR getting its due. And you know what it's had the effect that
3352000	3356400	it sat on the gaming industry. Cause if you think about it, you know, it's much more than that
3356400	3362560	machine that's bopping cheesy Eurodance tunes, but DDR made its way into school gymnasiums.
3363120	3366480	Like we have to remember people of a certain age, like you and I Loki,
3367680	3371920	when it was the winter time and physical education, we used to do square dancing,
3371920	3376160	right? I don't know about your school, but that was the thing is like during the rainy season,
3376160	3380080	we do square dancing inside the gym. Cause we couldn't go outside and play cause it was raining
3380080	3385520	all the time. Was that what they did at your school too? Um, yes, we did square. I think
3385520	3392960	they did square dancing and then like, um, I think there was other types of dancing that
3392960	3398320	they did as well. Like, I don't know if they did like salsa ballroom, like maybe salsa or
3398320	3403360	something. It was other, other types. It wasn't just square dancing, but yes, I remember square
3403360	3407120	dancing. But, but with the point I'm getting to, and I think y'all know where I'm going with this,
3407120	3413680	is that now for kids today, there's a lot of schools where winter phys ed is that DDR school
3413680	3420720	edition where like you do dance, dance revolution as a class. And now that, which is mind blowing
3420720	3426480	to me, that's, that's where we're at now. So DDR, you know, became a much bigger thing. It became
3426480	3430400	like a physical ed thing. And, you know, obviously DDR is still in the industry. We know there's
3430400	3434720	DDR ACE and, you know, in the arcade and you know, those, those are still coming out. I still,
3435280	3441280	you know, in the, that you a Bamani loyalist to this day, I love you. And you are going to hate
3441280	3447840	me for saying this. That's still a very niche thing. And it's only niche because Konami doesn't
3447840	3453040	care about home entertainment anymore. Um, and doesn't care and releasing peripherals and
3453040	3458160	releasing any of that in the home. So it's, it, you have to go to a round one or a Dave and
3458160	3464080	busters to find that stuff. And people just don't go there every day, you know? So, um,
3464080	3468720	still waiting with bitty breath for our, our round one to open up at some point,
3468720	3475040	a theaters open, um, early June was last I heard. Yeah. Keep them pushed back. I know
3475040	3482800	technically spring. So anyway, but, but DDR has had a lasting impact beyond just the machine,
3482800	3487440	you know, you, me and dark soccer all played years and years ago and the multiple mixes as
3487440	3493440	a result of that, like DDR became physical education activity, like, you know, teaching tool,
3493440	3498640	uh, in that regard. So, um, I, it absolutely earned its place in the hall of fame for sure,
3498640	3504560	but it's also wild to think about that game came out originally in 1998,
3504560	3513440	this show 20 years old started about DDR. Yep. Oh, you know, it's funny.
3514480	3518560	Uh, just announced tonight on the show prior to us, Bobby black Wolf,
3518560	3522480	Bobby black Wolf is going to be doing announcing again for summer games done quick, which is
3522480	3526720	awesome. Congratulations, Bobby. Nice. But it's the first time he's doing it in person because
3526720	3530400	summer games done quick is good. Or, you know, that's extremely exciting. That's yeah. It's
3530400	3534320	going to be in person again. So he gets to go out to Minneapolis for an entire week to do it.
3534880	3540800	Well, because of when it's time to guess what he's not going to be here, June 26,
3541520	3546240	my birthday and the same night that happens to be pretty much, Oh, technically the birthday
3546240	3551200	is on June 23rd, but the 26 will be the closest show to that day. So he's going to miss our will,
3551200	3556080	ours 20th anniversary. Luckily we all love games done quick here and think it's an
3556080	3561120	outstandingly worthy cause. So I'm not that pressed about it. I get it, but I just think
3561120	3570080	it's funny. So all right. Anyhow, let's move on something, something not as funny. Well,
3570080	3575680	it depends on your sense of humor. Maybe it is funny. Yeah. So, uh, the Prince of Persia remake
3575680	3583520	is having some issues. So it's been delayed quite a bit. Um, they originally estimated to come out,
3583520	3590720	uh, January, 2021. And I didn't even remember that it was supposed to come out then.
3590720	3598000	And right now it's changing studios again. So, uh, um, yeah, they put out a, uh,
3598000	3603360	the Prince of Persia, Twitter put out an update on development of Prince of Persia,
3603360	3608320	the sands of time remake. And of course they went over, uh, what was going on there.
3608320	3612560	It says the development of Prince of Persia, sands of time remake will now be led by Ubisoft
3612560	3619200	Montreal. Uh, the decision is important, um, important step and the team building upon the
3619200	3626800	work that she's by, uh, Ubisoft, uh, was it Pune? I don't really understand how they pronounce that
3626800	3632640	and Ubisoft, uh, Mumbai, and now they will take the time. They need to regroup and on the scope
3632640	3639120	of the game and deliver you the best experience. Um, so yeah, it's going to take more time.
3640320	3648560	I honestly forgot to be honest. I don't know. I forgot it was coming out too. I just assume
3648560	3653760	it had come out and nobody noticed or something like that. I mean, that's, that's neat. I guess
3653760	3660320	that they're still working on it. I mean, all right, cool. What are we going to do?
3662400	3666720	Uh, yeah, maybe I'll check it out when it actually comes out. If it's serviceable. I mean,
3666720	3670080	it sounds like the game has a lot of issues, but maybe, you know, at least they're taking the time
3670080	3674640	to fix them and they're not releasing a product that's broken. So there is that, um, as 200
3674640	3677920	Matt and Chad says, I forgot this was being worked on. I wouldn't be shocked if it's canned
3677920	3682480	at some point. Well, they're sticking to it for some reason. They're sticking to it. Like they're
3682480	3689040	sticking to, uh, that beyond good and evil sequel, right? Oh God. Speaking about things I forgot
3689040	3694720	about. That's right. That was supposed to be a thing, wasn't it? All right. Yeah. That was
3694720	3701520	announced way before Prince of Persia. So, you know, yeah. All right. You know, you know, no,
3701520	3708640	but you know what sequel we're going to get a lot sooner than that. Um, more of them not denouncing
3708640	3713680	all of this sexual harassment and, uh, bigotry that's going on in their company. We're getting
3713680	3718480	plenty of sequels for that where they just don't denounce that. So look forward to that very soon.
3718480	3724240	Maybe a trailer, a world exclusive trailer at summer games fast. Ouch, because it's true.
3725760	3730480	All right. Moving on to the next topic. I don't know why we're talking about roadblocks,
3730480	3737520	but we are because it's the biggest game in the world. We have one. I just don't really follow,
3737520	3742160	but yes, you're right. I know, I know. And it's, you know, they're making their own stuff in there.
3742160	3748560	Yeah, exactly. Well, now another company that is teaming up with Roblox is Spotify. So yes,
3748560	3753680	there is a new space in Roblox called Spotify island, where you can create music, chill in a
3753680	3760000	virtual venue and get exclusive virtual merchandise. And it's out now. Uh, it looks very green, just
3760000	3765200	like the Spotify logo. Uh, there's icons that are consistent with the apps and so forth. You can
3765200	3771760	also collect like icons for free merch. Uh, also, uh, artists will have the chance to connect with
3771760	3776160	fans as a way to earn money. A portion of the sales will go to artists, other than not saying
3776160	3781520	how much that is and what acts are really being collaborated with, but there's supposedly that's
3781520	3787120	in process. You know, we're available on Spotify as a podcast. Where's our island. Are we on
3787120	3792080	Spotify island? That's what I need to know. Can you listen to OLR on Spotify island?
3792800	3795600	I don't know. Or can you only listen to Joe Rogan because
3797840	3801680	that's the kids need to connect with Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. So
3803040	3808400	anyway, sorry, I had a hairball. Um, apparently the virtual world is full of Easter eggs. You
3808400	3814400	can find along the way. Uh, also you can do music and sounds with a beat maker station.
3814400	3820640	It's powered by soundtrack. Spotify bought them in 2017. So if you want to see what they used it
3820640	3826080	for, there you go. The first themed experience will be debuting in a few weeks. It's called
3826080	3833200	K park and it's all about K-pop. So you can interact with stray kids and soon me, uh, and
3833200	3839440	that won't be the last. So I can't wait for all the K-pop stands to just fly. That's the name
3839440	3844400	of abandoned, not just actual stray kids. So you wouldn't necessarily want to enter.
3847280	3854880	Well, all right. Let's see. Uh, bonds 006 says upon hearing this news, looks at Sony and home
3854880	3860080	and Sony music and the other labels they have. Yeah. Right. Like Sony could have had this.
3860080	3865200	They're late to the party. I mean, honestly, like this is basically like this and what they're
3865200	3870560	doing like in Fortnite kind of is more metaverse than the metaverse stuff. I mean, honestly,
3870560	3874000	I mean, this is what they kind of wanted is this whole thing where they can have spaces that
3874560	3879280	you can create and interact with different things and monetize the crap out of it. And so
3880720	3885120	here we are. I mean, Sony was doing that with home. I mean, they probably would if they,
3885120	3889120	you know, they could have had a Spotify place that you could have gone and visited in home.
3889120	3893920	If they had thought to involve K-pop, because I'll tell you what, K-pop stands
3894640	3898560	are the scariest stands on the internet and they're, they're going to flock to it.
3899120	3904640	As 200 Matt says, K-pop stands will break the network. A hundred percent. A hundred percent.
3907440	3915600	Let's move on to our next story. Uh, yes. So apparently NFT is still bad. Um,
3915600	3922080	there's folks that are fans, I guess, of the bored ape yacht club who are trying to buy
3922080	3928640	video game land. This is with the other deed collection where they can basically claim land
3928640	3936800	in, I guess, a space called the, uh, other side. And they say it's a play to earn gaming project
3937520	3944320	that's supported by their new crypto token, ape coin. Cause of course they have to have a token
3944320	3949760	on top of their NFTs and stuff. Cause why not? Um, definitely not going to be a rug pull because
3949760	3957040	that's not what any of these are ever. Um, but apparently though there's, um, other side was
3957040	3965040	intended to launch in April, but hasn't, um, really come out yet. And based on that, there's been,
3965920	3973600	you know, basically this is a big scam, I guess. Um, yeah. The other, other deed sale,
3973600	3979520	they said, uh, which launched at the end of April, uh, which includes, uh, Yuga labs,
3979520	3984400	which is the company, I guess the largest NFT mint in history. I think they're the ones behind
3984400	3992000	the bored ape yacht club. And, um, yeah, apparently they've had an issue with a lot of
3992000	3996880	failed transactions. They said due to the incredible demand being forced through the
3996880	4003200	Ethereum's bottleneck, uh, for those affected, we appreciate your willingness to build alongside us.
4003840	4012960	Um, but know that we've got your back on refunding your gas. So apparently what's happening,
4012960	4017840	I think is that they're paying money to buy these tokens, but the transaction's failing,
4017840	4020320	but they're not getting their money back type of thing.
4021280	4024560	And I don't want to just repeat the conversation we had earlier in the show,
4024560	4031120	but as long as this is representative of what NFTs are, they are never period bolded,
4031120	4037440	underlined, italicized. I will own that comment. They will never be successful. As long as this is
4037440	4042240	what's representing NFT, these games that they're coming up with to like force NFT to happen,
4042240	4047360	force fetch to happen in these games, not going to happen, kids, not going to happen.
4048000	4051200	You got to figure out a way to make it work with something that already exists out there.
4052000	4056400	Yeah. So the other thing too is, uh, earlier this week, actually on the fourth, they,
4056400	4062560	the yugolabs had announced that they'd refunded everyone's gas fees, um, that everyone that had,
4062560	4068160	uh, failed transactions. However, um, lots of folks still haven't received a refund.
4068880	4075040	And on top of that, there's also someone created a fake other side website that conned some of the
4075040	4082720	NFT holders out of more NFTs. Again, losing $6.2 million worth of NFTs. Once again, it's like,
4082720	4088400	when you ever hear an NFT story, it's always either a rug pull scam or someone's dealing them
4088480	4095840	via like some sort of, um, you know, malware or just, you know, your old school
4096880	4104080	kind of a phishing scam to try to get that kind of stuff. So I don't know.
4104080	4110880	What a fucking mess. That's all we have to say. Next up, next topic.
4110880	4118880	Yeah. So, uh, of course, you know, with a lot of these big acquisitions, you know,
4118880	4125120	there are going to be some new regulatory bodies looking into them. So the FTC is actually
4125120	4131360	investigating Sony's proposed bungee acquisition. Uh, they're saying that it's, you know,
4131360	4137360	they're looking to, um, make sure that I guess it's not going to be more, I don't really know,
4137360	4142080	like anti-competitive. I'm surprised they're looking at that and not necessarily the Activision
4142080	4146880	Blizzard one. Cause I think that the bungee one is much smaller scale than Activision Blizzard,
4146880	4150800	but I haven't heard that they're looking into that, but I would assume that they
4150800	4155840	should if they aren't already. Um, so yeah, I think that's pretty par for the course though,
4155840	4161600	that they would look into, you know, acquisitions like that, but we'll see if that might give their
4161600	4165840	blessing or not. I don't think this is as big of a deal as like the gaming media. I mean, it's a,
4165840	4170880	it's a, it's a clickbait headline in this case. I really don't think this is, of course, they're
4170880	4174480	going to investigate it with this big of a tree. Is it like you just said, it's, it's such a huge
4174480	4177920	transaction that of course they're going to investigate it. Um, and I don't, I don't think
4177920	4184240	this should be concerning it. This is there's, I feel like what gaming journalism in some ways is
4184240	4190320	trying to do is like, try to equate this to the Microsoft Blizzard merger and all the problems
4190320	4195360	that are going on there. This, that is apples to oranges people. Right. And I don't think that
4195440	4199920	they've necessarily done that yet. And speaking of Microsoft, I mean, they did investigate the,
4199920	4207600	um, acquisition of Bethesda back when they did that in, uh, was that 2021? Right. So I mean,
4208880	4213440	it's not like unheard of that they do this. And I would imagine that the same thing is going to
4213440	4218240	happen with the Activision acquisition, although we don't know, like that's probably still later
4218240	4224560	on down the line. Like they haven't really merged yet or like, or I don't think they're at that
4224560	4228960	point where they're investigated yet. Um, maybe because of all the crazy stuff going on with
4228960	4234240	Activision, but, um, I'm sure it will happen. I'm sure they'll look at it. They're not going
4234240	4237840	to be like, Oh, we're going to investigate this $3 billion one, but the other one,
4238400	4246000	the $70 billion one, that one's cool. All right. Well, let's move on to our next story
4246000	4253120	and talk about this. This is interesting. So, um, Fortnite is now available on X cloud gaming,
4253120	4259360	which is X boxes, X boxes powered, um, or, you know, Microsoft's, uh, cloud service. Right.
4259360	4266240	But what's interesting about this is that this is basically created a way now to play Fortnite
4266240	4273680	on an iPhone again, because Apple, what's that? I said, check me Apple. I'll get to that. I'll
4273680	4279360	get to that. So Epic games basically is now made, you know, Fortnite available on iPhone again,
4279360	4283360	because of the X cloud partnership, because you can just, you can do X cloud on the web,
4283360	4288480	even on a mobile device. So you can do that. So of course, Tim Sweeney goes and writes a tweet
4288480	4294640	and says, well, Fortnite's now available without the Apple tax. I'm summarizing that tweet. I
4294640	4298320	don't remember the exact tweet, but he's basically trying to say now you can do Fortnite and there's
4298320	4305040	no Apple tax, but I'm looking at that going. What about the Microsoft tax? Because it's still
4305120	4313440	running on X cloud. And as far as I know, Microsoft Sony, they all charge 30% as well.
4313440	4317840	Now, maybe the difference is it has to do that whole thing where Apple was very mad about the
4317840	4324240	back door and all that stuff. And, uh, they didn't want to have, um, uh, a way to, uh, you know,
4324240	4330320	buy them on the web and maybe Microsoft is allowing that, I guess. Um, but yeah, so this is,
4330320	4339040	uh, this is interesting how that's happened. So, um, but yeah, so Fortnite's now available to play
4339040	4346560	on all those devices if you want, but technically the headline is Fortnite is now on Xbox cloud
4346560	4352960	gaming. It just has this interesting side effect of now Tim Sweeney is hyping it up as,
4352960	4361760	Oh, we're back on this. So it's interesting. So, all right. So now this is the part of the
4361760	4366480	show where things are going to get very interesting here, but I'll explain here in
4366480	4381520	a minute because we have a segment to do. So let's roll the bumper. And now it's time to travel back
4381520	4387520	to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4387520	4398960	It's time for the classic game of the week. So here's the problem. Dark soccer had picked a game.
4399680	4404000	I don't know anything about it. And I wouldn't want to do a game she picked anyway,
4404000	4407440	cause it's her game to talk about in her memory. It's not mine, especially when I don't know the
4407440	4412400	game. So we have to, and we haven't really had notice or time to prepare. So I had to pull
4412400	4420320	something literally out of the blue. However, I checked the Wiki and this game has not been done
4420320	4426240	before, believe it or not. So, uh, Loki, you're going to have to help me with tonight's classic
4426240	4431920	game of the week because, and I can't, I can't tell you why I was inspired to pick this game,
4431920	4439680	but the classic game of the week tonight is let me get it up here. Uh, magic pen gel.
4440800	4447680	It's a classic game of the week. So, and well, it's funny cause I was like, surely we did this
4447680	4453040	as a classic game at some point because we did. I thought we did too, but I am on the Wiki right
4453040	4459120	now. I'm looking at it and I just did a control find. I'm like magic. Okay. There was magical
4459120	4462960	night dreams and magic. Nope, no match. That's why you just heard that flip because they can't
4462960	4468400	find a search for it. So there is no magic pen gel. It's not there. We just talk about it on
4468400	4474640	the show an awful lot. So there you go. So, but we can talk about magic pen gel now. So let's talk
4474640	4481680	about this. Um, and yeah, dark soccer and chat says, damn, it's old enough. Uh, Oh, and she said
4481680	4484800	I could have done the other game. I didn't know anything about that game, dark soccer. I didn't
4484800	4491840	want to do it. This played this game before. Yes. This game is old enough. It came out in
4491840	4498000	North America, June 24th, 2003. So this game is damn near 20 years old. It actually came out in
4498000	4504800	Japan, March 20th, 2002. So in Japan it's over 20 years old at this point. Okay. It's called magic
4504800	4514160	pen gel, the quest for color. It's a original name. Garakuta Meisaku Geijo Rakugake Okoku
4514160	4518560	is the original name of the game. It's a role playing game that was developed by Garakuta
4518560	4524240	studio and title for the PlayStation two here in North America. It was published by age tech
4524240	4528720	apparently studio Ghibli was involved in this game because the musical compositions in the
4528720	4533840	game were done by Zuntada. So there was also a sequel for the game that came later called
4533840	4538080	graffiti kingdom, but we're not talking about that tonight. Basically, what is this game? It's
4538080	4545840	Pokemon meets Mario paint. That's what it is. You create your own little creatures in a in game
4545840	4552560	drawing system that actually worked pretty well to basically do a version of Pokemon.
4553200	4557040	The pen gels are with it. So they're not called Pokemon. They're called, I'm sorry. The pen gel
4557040	4564000	is a little pen fairy thing that creates the doodles. So the doodles are actually
4564000	4567760	the little Pokemon. And so you sketch out what the body looks like and you have a certain amount
4567760	4572800	of magic energy. So like the link is, or the ink, excuse me, isn't unlimited. You have a certain
4572800	4578640	amount of it. And you do these battles with the custom created design, you trade with other
4578640	4582960	players. You know, it's interesting with this whole discussion about NFT tonight,
4583840	4587120	these magic pen gels could be NFTs essentially.
4588960	4593600	Yeah, it's like our horrible 2d x controller that we stuff fight.
4593600	4597120	Oh yeah, that's right. We drove drew like a 2d extra toy. This game was well,
4597120	4600400	Loki, why don't you talk about some of your memories with this game? Because you played
4600400	4604720	this more than I did really? Yes. Yeah. So it was fun because you did get the draw,
4604720	4608480	whatever you wanted in there. And based on the colors that you use, you'd have different
4608480	4613360	abilities. So I think like they have like, you know, magic abilities or physical attack and
4613360	4617520	stuff like that. It would depend on like the ink colors or paint colors they got. I think you would
4617520	4623200	unlock more as you went along. So of course, you know, we had, I think we had a 2d x controller
4623200	4629280	that we made. There was just one it was just a big, like box. It was just like a big blue box
4629280	4634640	thing. And of course, and the chat room is lighting up going penis, penis, penis, penis.
4634640	4641520	Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, come on. Yeah, of course. We did that worldwide audience here on Twitch.
4641520	4646960	Come on. Of course, drawing a gigantic penis and balls was like one of the first
4646960	4653520	monsters created in this game. Everybody does it. Come on. It was fantastic. Yes. Such a glorious
4653520	4659440	game. In fact, I'm surprised this game wasn't called magic penis, because that's what everybody
4659440	4666160	made for their doodles. It was great, though, like, the thing about graffiti kingdom, though,
4666160	4670480	is a little bit different. So like, this game is more of a traditional kind of like RPG, like,
4670480	4674640	you like would battle and stuff. And they have like turn based battles. Whereas I think
4674640	4682080	graffiti kingdom was more of a like an action RPG type thing, you would just kind of like,
4682080	4685440	roam the world and do them things. I never actually played graffiti kingdom. But
4685840	4693440	yeah, this game was pretty fun. It was the drawing technology in the game was based on
4694080	4699440	Takeo Igarashi's teddy software. And I'm not sure what else that was used in. But apparently,
4699440	4703680	it is a sketching interface for 3d design. So it was kind of based on something that
4703680	4708640	was already out there, which I think is very interesting. On the reception to this game,
4708640	4712880	it was average pretty much, you know, a lot of seven and eights around the board, C plus
4712880	4718160	things like that for me to gave it a 32 out of 40. So for me to you know, not bad,
4718800	4723920	especially in those years now they hand out 40s like they're nothing but back then that was still
4723920	4729760	still something in a review by IGN. It was noted that the monster creation system lives up to a
4729760	4734400	potential for creating unique looking creatures and providing gameplay depth, different body
4734400	4738880	parts, colors and sizes affected abilities and statistics in battle. Yeah, that was I always
4738880	4742080	thought that was really interesting, too. Even if at the end of the day, they're saying it was
4742080	4747520	a giant game of rock, paper, scissors. The variety of attacks and spells with the custom monsters
4747520	4752960	could be kind of funny. And you know, what's cool is that Teddy software is it's a 3d modeling asset
4752960	4761360	now for unity. Oh, we can make a sequel. That's kind of neat, though. So you could so you could
4761360	4766320	bring back the 2d x machine and the penis monster and put them in a unity asset game basically is
4766320	4770560	what you're saying. Sure, you could totally do that. It's not expensive. It's like 30 bucks.
4770640	4776160	Just what I've always wanted. All right. Anyhow, let's see the care of some of the characters from
4776160	4781680	the game Zoe and Taro. They showed up later in a game called lost magic on the Nintendo DS,
4781680	4789120	which was also made by Tyto. So it looked like they aged a bit but that was magic pen gel. So
4790640	4795520	it was a lot of fun memories, especially if you go back to like early OLR. Because again,
4795520	4800320	that game came out during the first or second year of OLR. When we were doing three hours
4800320	4807120	every week about literally nothing. We played this game a lot and it was it was a good time
4807120	4811600	many memories playing this game just because it was just silly to draw that it was it was
4811600	4818720	neat to draw them in a 2d space and see them 3d animated. That's what it was. It's like you could
4818720	4824960	draw a 2d x machine you could draw a boner you could draw all sorts of horribly animated
4825920	4833040	in 3d but it was so like bad it was funny type of thing. So yeah, anyway, magic pen gel I would
4833040	4838240	consider it a cult classic. And that's our classic game of the week for sure. I love this game.
4839200	4846000	Anyway, there it is. Good pick Loki that inspired me to throw it in the back if you want to continue
4846000	4851680	watching the game Loki has it running behind him right now. Like I said, I can't imagine why I
4851680	4856560	thought to do this as the classic game of the week. But I was like surely surely that had been
4856560	4862160	picked at some point. Oh, no, no, no. Alrighty, then there we go. We'll do it tonight. We'll do
4862160	4869280	it live. All right, moving on. Let's get into some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other
4869280	4873680	headlines around the industry. We'll start with Loki. I'll take the one that Jamie had. So I'll
4873680	4879680	take her story. You can do the other two lucky. All right. So the steam deck can now officially
4879680	4884480	run a ton more games than of course, when it launched. So I think when it launched,
4884480	4891520	it was about 400 games or so that were playable. Now they're almost up to 2500 games that are
4891520	4900240	playable. And then they verified it looks like about like 1200 of those that are, you know,
4900240	4908400	able to run I guess really well on the team deck. Yeah, 12 or 1289 games are fully verified.
4908960	4918240	And they said a further 11 or 1169 are playable. I'm not sure what exactly the difference between
4918240	4924320	playable and verified me, I guess just how will they run? Maybe like graphical bugs,
4924320	4929600	skipping audio hiccups, like just probably performance just with like the chip that's
4929600	4934960	on there, the APU and stuff. So but yeah, that's cool. Let's see that a lot more are compatible
4934960	4939200	now. So yeah, I mean, everyone's pretty excited about the steam deck. So yeah,
4939200	4942320	but the early stuff I've heard is pretty good. I'm getting to the point where I think I kind
4942320	4946320	of want one. But now I'm just going to hold off and wait and see if valve refreshes the hardware
4946320	4950000	in it. It's still really hard to get obviously, as you know, there's still shortages and stuff.
4950000	4953760	But I think at some point, you know, we had the story last week about how some of that is easing
4953760	4958880	up. And I'll wait to see when valve does the inevitable refresh of the steam deck and kind
4958960	4961440	of beefs up what's inside it, then maybe I'll try to get one.
4962320	4970320	Yeah. So Sonic the Hedgehog Two is now officially the highest grossing movie adaptation of a video
4970320	4979440	game franchise at the US box office. They are they've reached $331 million. Whereas the previous
4979440	4988160	movie was 319 million. So they, which is pretty good, considering that the 319 million I mean,
4988640	4994560	I don't know what that necessarily means as far as this movie, but like, it made 319 million during
4995360	4998960	2020. Which, you know, when movie theaters are closed,
4998960	5003920	Oh, yeah, yeah, there were so many movie theaters that for like an entire year still had Sonic the
5003920	5008160	Hedgehog movie posters up because that was the big movie that came out the weekend before everything
5008160	5014560	shut down. Yeah, it's good movie. Good movies. Yeah. How much would the first one have made if
5014560	5018960	COVID didn't happen the way it did? That's a very, yeah, would that but it's hard to say
5018960	5024800	sequels almost always, you know, for big AAA franchises, sequels almost always outgrow the
5024800	5030400	original, which is why the bar for this new avatar, which I guess there's a there's a teaser
5030400	5035200	trailer that's been shown. I did not see it. Yeah, I've only seen like the reaction online
5035200	5039520	and stuff. So I don't I don't know if it just showed in random theaters or what or it was
5039520	5045360	supposed to be before Dr. Strange, but I, I went to the bathroom right before the move. Well,
5045360	5051440	like is typically at the movie theater and I was shocked. Typically, the movie times that they give
5051440	5057680	you is like practically when they start rolling trailers. But ironically, this time, the movie
5057680	5063680	started at the movie time. And so the trailers were actually earlier. So I missed like a trailer
5063680	5069680	or two. But yeah, who cares? It's Avatar. It's like way too late for a sequel for that. But
5069680	5080960	whatever. I cheddar cheddars here. Hi. cheddar does not like being picked up. Okay, bye cheddar.
5082160	5086400	Anyway, um, but y'all wanted me to get cheddar on stream during all our at some point. So there you
5086400	5091680	go. Anyway, yeah. So Bobby says that he saw the trailer before strange. Alright, so I thought
5091680	5096160	because I you would think it'd be all over Twitter by now like leaks of the trailer and stuff. But
5096160	5102640	yeah, they were just, you know, uploaded to YouTube like, yeah, movie studios do. But I
5102640	5108480	was just saying the bar for that one is going to be incredibly high. But anyway, um, it's
5109920	5114240	many folks in chatter saying cheddar did not look please know he doesn't really love getting picked
5114240	5118960	up. I did that for y'all because I promised I'd put cheddar on stream at some point. So
5119760	5123840	all right, if I put his little toy on that table back there, he might get up on that. So we'll see.
5123840	5129680	I'll try that again later. Anyway, um, what else is it gonna say with that? Oh,
5130720	5135520	I was just surprised honestly, that Sonic two is like the biggest video game movie,
5135520	5140480	but then I'm like, well, I guess really, what else would there have been? Right? Like either
5140480	5146240	it came out in the 90s. And there's been inflation since the 90s. But there hasn't been a lot recently
5146240	5149600	that like, you know, what a bowl movie was going to make that kind of money.
5149600	5156320	Haha. Well, there is a Pokemon. Yeah, yeah. Detective Pikachu. That did really well.
5157680	5161840	But not that well, not as well, Sonic. I mean, honestly, there hasn't been a lot of
5162400	5166880	video game franchise movies that have come out that have done a lot. Yeah.
5168640	5174320	So it'll be, but now it's an article because it's slow. Here's, here's the other question.
5174640	5182160	How long will Sonic to hold that crown? Because that Mario movie, I know it got bumped to 2023.
5182160	5187680	And I'm, I'm sorry to make it a Mario versus Sonic thing, but let's be real. There's a lot
5187680	5191760	of people that are going to see that Mario movie. A lot of people that are going to take their kids
5191760	5196560	to see that Mario movie. I think Sonic's probably going to get to thrown by Mario,
5196560	5202560	which is hilarious to say. You got to, you got to admit there's a certain, I know, I know we got
5203200	5207040	like tiger claws, a huge Sonic fan in the chat, but you have to admit there's something funny
5207040	5211440	about me saying Sonic's about to get kicked out, get, get his butt kicked by Mario.
5213520	5218400	But I think it is still, you know, that's still a huge accomplishment for Sonic. Cause honestly,
5219760	5223680	I never would have thought the first movie would have done as well as it did. And I don't know if
5223680	5227520	that, and that's no, no shade. It's just that video game movies don't tend to typically do
5227520	5234720	that well. So it, you know, did great. Phoenix 77, 26 says, Rob, there was a uncharted movie
5234720	5239840	a few months ago. Oh yeah. That's right. Yeah. That ain't breaking a box.
5241200	5246400	No, it is not. No, it is not. Orange. Right. It says how well did the angry birds movie do?
5246400	5252400	Not 300 million. Well, but those were actually pretty good. I like the first one. I've watched
5252400	5256960	the first one several times. I have not watched the second one, but the first one was pretty good.
5257680	5262400	All right. All right. In one other rapid fire news story here tonight,
5262400	5268480	Jason talked about this in the intro tonight, but it's, it's interesting. The gold plated
5268480	5278080	Nintendo Wii. It's a one of a kind Nintendo Wii is going up for auction. THQ who not the same THQ
5278080	5283120	Nordic that exists today, because this was the THQ before they went bankrupt and had had their
5283120	5290320	name bought by THQ Nordic. So the old THQ, uh, made this 24 karat gold plated Wii,
5290320	5295200	and they were intending to give it to queen Elizabeth in 2009. The whole fucking thing
5295200	5301520	was promotion for a flop game called big family games. Anyone remember big family games? We had
5301520	5307120	any big family games fans out there. You can probably tell by the title alone. It was that
5307120	5315200	kind of Wii title. And there was, it was like, look, we're like Wii sports too. Please buy us.
5315200	5320160	There's so many of them. So many of them. Yeah. I would have thought it was Mario party,
5320160	5325200	but all right. But anyway, maybe we'll get a sequel to big family games on the switch.
5326720	5333280	However, here's the funny part. It never actually got to the queen because there is a very strict
5333280	5338720	Royal gift policy because who knows, maybe they thought there'd be anthrax in that Wii or
5338720	5342640	something. So they don't, they don't allow the queen to get gifts like that. So it was returned
5342640	5351360	to THQ. A collector got it from a studio contact in 2017. And now a Dutch collector named Don,
5352320	5356640	who runs, I guess, console variations is now putting this up for sale.
5356640	5364320	Originally, Don tried to sell this on eBay in October, 2021 for $300,000. However,
5364320	5369680	eBay originally shut them down because that's too much money. So now the auction is up at
5369680	5376400	golden, which is a place that allows these types of things. Bidding is already up to $2,000. I want
5376400	5382400	to actually see what it's at. Is it 3000 now? But like they give you big family games with it and
5382480	5389200	you, whoopee. Who wants to buy the gold-plated Wii so you can mod it?
5391440	5394720	I do. I want to mod it. I ain't paying for it.
5397280	5402960	Well, you know what it won't do? Load the Wii shop or have online multiplayer because those
5402960	5408640	features are no longer available. Anyway, the whole thing's a big publicity stunt,
5408640	5411600	but it's an actual gold-plated Wii. I guess it works.
5412160	5412960	So there's that.
5412960	5416560	And the gold plating's chipping off on it. Ooh, that looks so great.
5417440	5421520	DarkSakura still hanging out in our chat and lending her endless wit,
5421520	5425680	saying golden Wii is a sign of dehydration. We'll leave it at that.
5426960	5431040	Ssho100matt points out this title, the big family games, this gets localized,
5431040	5433920	but not President Cat. Don't get me started.
5434480	5438160	Well, to be fair, big family games was probably in English,
5438160	5443440	so it'd take nothing to localize it. But yes, it's a terrible game.
5443440	5445920	What's Mother 3's excuse? Happy Mother's Day.
5445920	5451200	All right. By the way, can I just say, again, Reggie Fils-Aime doing this whole book tour.
5451200	5453760	So of course everyone's asking him about Mother 3.
5454880	5458560	And now he's posting tongue-in-cheek tweets about the whole thing.
5459360	5461280	Reggie, you're great.
5462240	5465200	I've been enjoying the interviews I've been seeing with you in it.
5465920	5468000	I really can't wait to read your book.
5468000	5470720	I really admire you, Reggie, and what you've done for the industry.
5471760	5473360	Please just shut up about Mother 3.
5474640	5476480	You're just pouring salt in the wound.
5476480	5478240	Please just shut up about Mother 3.
5478240	5480480	Just say, it didn't happen.
5480480	5482320	It's not everything happens in the end.
5482320	5483360	Now shut up and move on.
5483360	5485200	Just please, for all of our sake.
5485200	5488400	And people, the rest of the industry, stop asking him about it.
5488400	5490080	He doesn't work for Nintendo anymore.
5490160	5491600	Stop asking him what happened.
5493360	5494480	It just, it didn't happen.
5495840	5496640	Moving on.
5496640	5500400	Let's talk about some games that will come out, unlike Mother 3,
5500960	5502720	in a segment called World Release Dates.
5502720	5504320	Let's start with the U.S., Loki.
5505040	5510960	We have IUDEN Chronicles Rising on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,
5510960	5512000	and Xbox Series.
5512800	5517520	Salt and Sacrifice on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
5518160	5524320	We Were Here Forever on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5525760	5526160	Let's see.
5527200	5533360	Brigadine, The Legend of Runzea, I don't know.
5534320	5536240	That's going to be out on PC.
5536960	5546480	And then we have the Centennial Case, a Shinjima story on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,
5546480	5547840	PlayStation 5.
5547840	5552320	And last but not least, Evil Dead, the game on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation
5552320	5554320	5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5555360	5555860	All right.
5557120	5559440	Let's go over to Japan and check out the releases there.
5559440	5564080	So coming out in Japan this week on the Nintendo Switch, Gold Week was this last week.
5564080	5565920	So now we're getting into releases again.
5565920	5570560	So May 12th, we'll see on Nintendo Switch, the Centennial Case, a Shinjima story is out
5570560	5571360	this week.
5571360	5573760	And Dead by Daylight gets a release on Nintendo Switch.
5573760	5577200	I think that was already out in Japan, but they're getting an Ultimate Edition.
5577200	5579520	And I was like, well, what's all in the Ultimate Edition?
5579520	5581200	And I noticed Oni is on the cover.
5581200	5582480	So OK, that one's there.
5582480	5588640	But then as I look at the list of DLC, there's 13 pieces of DLC, including Portrait of a
5588640	5589760	Murder, which is pretty recent.
5589760	5591920	That's the artist all included with it.
5591920	5593520	So that's pretty impressive.
5593520	5598640	That's a lot of stuff for basically what is otherwise a standard price Nintendo Switch
5598640	5598880	game.
5598880	5601200	So yeah, pretty interesting deal there.
5601200	5602720	So that is out in Japan this week.
5603360	5605600	Moving over to the PlayStation 5.
5605600	5606160	Same thing.
5606160	5611440	You get Dead by Daylight is also out in Japan on PlayStation 5, as is the Centennial Case.
5613760	5614560	Yeah, that's it.
5616640	5618160	Let's go over to the UK.
5618160	5619440	Do you have that available, Loki?
5619440	5620400	Or do I need one?
5620400	5622080	Yeah, not a whole lot coming out there.
5622080	5629200	So we've got Tourist Bus Simulator that's going to be coming out on PlayStation, Evil
5629200	5632720	Dead, the game on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.
5632720	5634800	And let's get fit on the Switch.
5634800	5635300	That's it.
5636560	5639200	Dark Soccer's pointing out DBD is super huge in Japan.
5639200	5643600	Yeah, I think it's actually it's been growing in a relatively recently over there.
5644560	5645600	So that's kind of interesting.
5646480	5649520	SG100 Matt says the Evil Dead, the game looks fun, by the way.
5649520	5650800	Also very Sam Raimi.
5650800	5652240	I'd like to check that game out.
5652240	5654400	I'll watch people play it on Twitch and see if it's for me or not.
5655840	5657360	So all right.
5657360	5659280	We have just a few more stories for you.
5659280	5661920	And then we'll invite your calls and your emails.
5661920	5665440	I know we have at least one email tonight and whatever else your chat comments in our
5665440	5666240	listener roundtable.
5666240	5669120	But first, let's get you some more stories.
5669120	5670480	Loki, I think you have one for us.
5671520	5678160	Yeah, Hayden Blackman is apparently leaving Hangar 13 studio, which was the studio that
5678160	5680080	created Mafia 3.
5680960	5687440	And, you know, with that, even though he is leaving, they are going to be continuing on
5687440	5693040	with a new Mafia game that'll be coming out at some point, I guess.
5693040	5693840	Whenever it's done.
5694400	5695280	Whatever it's done.
5695280	5695920	Yeah.
5695920	5699600	So we haven't had a new one of those in a while, right?
5701120	5702960	Mafia 3 didn't come out very.
5702960	5703760	Yeah, it was a while ago.
5703760	5705040	It was a while ago at this point.
5705040	5709120	Yeah, but they're saying, though, that the new Mafia game that was expected to be made
5709120	5713520	in the Unreal Engine 5 instead of the Mafia 3 engine.
5713520	5716640	So, I mean, Unreal 5 looks pretty awesome.
5716640	5718080	So cool.
5718080	5719360	I can't wait to see that.
5719360	5719840	Yeah.
5719840	5723600	And then I play it because I don't play any of the Mafia.
5723600	5724560	Well, let's talk.
5724560	5725680	But it will look cool.
5726400	5727040	I got this story.
5727040	5728960	This next story JB was going to do, but I'll talk about it.
5729920	5734880	Let's talk about another game nobody is interested in playing, apparently, and that's Babylon's
5734880	5735520	fall, man.
5735520	5737520	The news just gets worse and worse in this game.
5737520	5742560	I got to admit, I had a curious eye on this game at first because I heard about the Final
5742560	5744720	Fantasy 14 assets being used and so forth.
5744720	5750320	And then I heard about the cash in the cash in the cash, and they were so desperate to
5750320	5755600	make this a live service game that they could keep cashing in on after that initial $60
5755600	5760400	fee that, boy, that whole thing really shot him in the foot, even though platinum games
5760400	5762320	usually makes platinum titles.
5762320	5762960	This one.
5762960	5763200	Wow.
5763840	5767680	In fact, a lot of news sites are running with this headline.
5767680	5769920	It's down to one concurrent player.
5770560	5771840	Well, here's the thing.
5771840	5776880	You know, those concurrent player counts are a snapshot in time, and somebody caught on
5776880	5783600	Steam charts that there was one player playing it on Wednesday, May 4th, 2022.
5784160	5789440	So on May the fourth, May the fourth was not with Babylon's fall because one person was
5789440	5789760	playing it.
5789760	5792800	They probably just left their computer on or something in the middle of the night.
5793200	5795440	But it's noon somewhere in the world.
5795440	5798960	So, yeah, that's not a great look for this game.
5798960	5804640	Of course, we had already talked about a story not that long ago where it was only like a
5804640	5807840	thousand people if that were playing it like when the game came out.
5807840	5808800	So, yike.
5810080	5815200	And, you know, they kept promising they're going to try to make improvements, but we're
5815200	5816000	not seeing them yet.
5816000	5820800	But platinum games is saying there is no plans to scale back the development of Babylon's
5820800	5821040	fall.
5822800	5826800	I think if they want this game to have a chance, they're going to have to fall the price to
5826800	5827120	free.
5828080	5829760	And that's it.
5829760	5831680	That's the do or die moment for this game.
5831680	5837520	Follow the price to free or this game is done and you all are wasting your fucking time.
5838160	5841520	But that's just my perception on that.
5841520	5842320	Loki, I don't know.
5842320	5844240	Any interest at all in Babylon's fall?
5844880	5845760	No, not at all.
5846640	5848000	I'd check it out if it was free.
5848560	5849680	Platinum games is great.
5849680	5850320	I'd check it out.
5850400	5851120	Even do that.
5851120	5851620	Yeah.
5852400	5852800	All right.
5853520	5855680	They probably have more than one player, that's for sure.
5856640	5858160	Loki, what do you got for us next?
5858880	5865280	I had to check and see what year it was because we're getting reports that Nintendo sports
5865280	5868320	fans, it's TV smashing time.
5869200	5874320	So folks aren't following the concert reminders to put wrist straps on and they're throwing
5874320	5879360	their Nintendo Switch controllers into the screens.
5880880	5884480	Joy cons are taking flight and smashing into screens.
5885840	5889120	What happens if you only have a switch light?
5889120	5892960	Do you just do you accidentally throw your entire switch because you don't have?
5892960	5895600	I don't know if you can play that game on the switch light, to be honest.
5896720	5899040	I heard it's limited.
5899040	5902160	Like there's only certain games you can play and it's limited.
5902160	5906480	I would think you could just get a second pair of independent joy cons and pair them
5906480	5908240	to the switch light and play them that way.
5908240	5909600	I would think true.
5909600	5910080	Yes.
5910080	5913360	In that case, you'd have to do a combo with that.
5913360	5921040	You would throw your loose joy cons into the screen, which is exactly.
5923280	5928800	So it's a little bit more challenging, but if you're up for the challenge, then you
5928800	5929920	could break everything.
5932240	5932560	All right.
5932560	5938080	E3VL in chat says it only works tabletop on single player, cannot play multiplayer.
5939040	5939520	All right.
5941280	5942400	Lastly, I'm sorry.
5942400	5946560	I thought this headline was too funny, even though I will fully admit I've never really
5946560	5951360	played this game, but I've heard the jokes over the years about how Eve online is basically
5951360	5952640	a spreadsheet simulator.
5953280	5954560	Well, I'll be damned.
5954560	5956080	I think this is so funny.
5956080	5958480	So there's actually, you know, there's enough people that play this game.
5958480	5961040	I haven't played it, but it's still a fairly popular online game.
5961040	5966720	It's got its fans and they have this Eve fan fest that they do well at the fan fest.
5966720	5973040	They announced, they reached out to Microsoft and there is now an official extension that
5973040	5979360	will pull data from Eve online and automatically put it into an Excel spreadsheet.
5979360	5985440	So an official Microsoft collaboration, a Microsoft Excel add on for Eve online and
5985440	5988560	the crowd, as you would expect, went fucking nuts.
5988560	5991360	And they were very, cause you know, they're all in on the joke.
5991360	5996880	So they went nuts and people tweeting, this is the best update that Eve has ever done.
5998320	6005600	So an early prototype of this was shown and more details are coming out later this year.
6006560	6008400	And that's pretty awesome.
6008400	6011200	Also, of course, there was more announced a fan fest, not just Excel.
6011200	6014960	Can you imagine if you went, can you imagine going to Blizzcon?
6014960	6022480	And the big announcement is now we're, now we're going to work with PowerPoint.
6023360	6025120	That's a big announcement.
6025120	6029920	Of course, that would still be a better year than the year they announced the Diablo mobile
6029920	6030640	phone game.
6033360	6034560	Don't you all have phones?
6035440	6037360	Which is finally coming out in June.
6037360	6038240	Exciting, right?
6039040	6043280	And then apparently, I know we didn't talk about it on the show cause we don't talk about
6043280	6046640	current topics, but I will just say they did announce something else.
6048000	6049440	It looks like trash.
6049440	6050320	I'm sorry.
6050320	6052480	It looks like such trash.
6052480	6053040	Yikes.
6053040	6053520	I'm sorry.
6053520	6053920	I'm sorry.
6053920	6054560	I can't help it.
6055200	6055520	All right.
6056560	6061040	Anyhow, but Microsoft Excel, I'm all for that kind of collaboration.
6061840	6064960	Bobby Black Wolf says CCP has that kind of humor too.
6064960	6066000	So it fits.
6066000	6066500	Yeah.
6068080	6068580	All right.
6069520	6073120	Let's move on to, I think that was it for stories.
6073440	6076400	So now we're ready to talk to our listeners and listen around table.
6076400	6080160	If you would like to give us a call, you can join our discord server, vog network.com
6080160	6080960	slash discord.
6080960	6083200	That's VOG network.com slash discord.
6083200	6087120	And if you had to head to the green room, we'll take some of your calls on the show,
6087120	6092240	but I know we had at least one email because we always invite your emails as well, because
6092240	6097600	I know people listen to us on the podcast feed available in all your favorite podcast
6097600	6098160	apps.
6098160	6101440	And so some of you will send emails throughout the week.
6103440	6108320	Sorry, I'm buying time because I'm not logged into the email bag currently, but I know I
6108320	6112240	saw at least one come in earlier and it's from somebody who actually calls us quite
6112240	6112740	a bit.
6113520	6115040	We have an email tonight from Rama.
6116880	6118880	Participate at orange launch, radio.com.
6118880	6122960	If you want to send us an email for a future week, Rama writes in and says, greetings,
6122960	6123920	one and all.
6123920	6127520	I hope that the weekend has been eventful for you all a couple of things and I'll be
6127520	6128400	on my way.
6128400	6134640	Number one, is there a game that you started playing that at first you thought was mediocre,
6134640	6137760	but as you played more of it, you ended up falling in love with the game.
6138320	6142080	For example, I bought persona five for a friend to play in stream.
6142720	6145840	At first, when she started playing, it was all right to her and she wasn't sure that
6145840	6147040	she'd continue.
6147040	6153600	But one year and 300 plus hours later, she ended up loving the game, the lore, the characters,
6153600	6154400	everything with it.
6155360	6155840	Yes.
6155840	6159280	And I've mentioned this one on the show before, and you're going to say, oh, of course.
6159280	6160960	But my answer to this is easy.
6160960	6165840	Mass Effect would be it because the first time I played Mass Effect, I didn't get it.
6165840	6168080	I was just like, oh, this is just shooty, shooty, bang, bang.
6168080	6169040	I don't think I'm into this.
6169600	6170080	Whatever.
6170080	6175680	This is just, yeah, I don't like RPGs unless they're JRPGs.
6175680	6177360	I don't really want to play this anymore.
6177360	6182800	And then I went back years later to check out the entire trilogy and I fell in love
6182800	6183280	with it.
6183280	6185360	And I love the original trilogy.
6185360	6189120	And obviously, as you all know, some of my favorite games that have ever been made.
6189120	6190320	So that's my easy answer.
6190320	6192080	I mean, and I think you all saw it coming.
6192960	6194000	Loki, is there one for you?
6195280	6197360	I can't think of anything offhand.
6197360	6197860	Maybe.
6198400	6200320	I mean, I don't know.
6200320	6206160	It wasn't necessarily mediocre, but like I know Minecraft originally, like when it first
6206160	6207440	came out, I didn't get it.
6207440	6208160	And you know what?
6208160	6208800	Me too.
6208800	6212800	I didn't play it, but it wasn't that I played it and went, this is all right.
6213280	6215120	Once I played, I was like, Oh man, this is awesome.
6215840	6218880	So there was never kind of a mediocre point to that.
6218880	6222000	But yeah, I can't really think of anything.
6222000	6223440	I mean, I'm sure there's something.
6223440	6226640	The other one that's obvious for me is No Man's Sky.
6226640	6228720	You know, I never showed up about that game here on the show.
6229280	6230560	I love that game now.
6230560	6236320	But the difference there is that, and we all know this, No Man's Sky today in 2021, 17
6236320	6239360	patches later, is not the same game that originally was released.
6239360	6244320	So it's not quite a fair game to use as an answer to that, I think.
6245520	6246880	Some answers from our chat.
6246880	6249120	SH2100 Matt says Undertale for me.
6251120	6251600	Let's see.
6251600	6257200	Dark Sakura is still in chat hanging out, saying Mass Effect, Dragon Age 2, and Dead
6257200	6258800	by Daylight for me.
6258800	6259300	Oh yeah.
6260640	6265920	I'm trying to think if I played Dead by Daylight before Alan started watching all the Twitch
6265920	6268000	streamers and I got into it that way.
6268000	6269040	I don't think I ever did.
6270000	6274640	I didn't even really play it until I watched Alan watching all the Twitch streamers.
6274640	6276160	And I was like, all right, I'll try this.
6276160	6277680	And then Alan was playing it too.
6277680	6278800	And I was like, all right, I'll try this.
6278800	6280560	And then I turned out I really liked it.
6281600	6284320	Dark Sakura says, wow, World of Warcraft as well.
6284320	6288160	Like for her, it wasn't until Cataclysm that it got good and then it got crap again.
6288160	6288660	Yeah.
6290800	6291120	Yeah.
6291120	6294480	Wow was one of those games like I would kind of go back and forth with too.
6294480	6297760	Like I started it, then I went away, then I started again and all that stuff.
6298720	6299220	All right.
6300080	6301680	Back to Rama's email.
6301680	6305360	Number two, this is a follow-up to my call from two weeks ago.
6305360	6310240	As of May 2nd, I am no longer a contract employee for the company I work for.
6310240	6314160	I am now a full-time employee with the benefits the company has to offer.
6314160	6316240	For that, I'm very thankful and appreciative.
6316240	6320400	As I said before, being a contract employee can suck because you don't get the full benefits
6320400	6322240	and discounts the company has to offer.
6322240	6323760	But if you wait it out, work hard.
6323760	6325600	And if you're lucky enough, you'll be in.
6325600	6328800	For the record, during my tenure as a contract employee for NBC,
6328800	6333760	Fresh Direct and a couple other places, I've seen temps quit and go on to greener pastures.
6333760	6338000	I stayed because I felt appreciated for the work that I did and the pay wasn't bad.
6338000	6340080	Take care, stay fabulous, Rama.
6340080	6341520	Well, congratulations, Rama.
6341520	6343040	Big hearty congratulations.
6343040	6343680	You did it.
6343680	6344480	You earned it.
6344480	6347360	And I can't think of anyone more deserving personally.
6348080	6349840	So I'm very happy for you, Rama.
6349840	6350880	Congratulations on that.
6351520	6354240	Loki, I think that was the week you were off for your surgery.
6354240	6358720	But that was the week that the Nintendo thing was in the headline about the contract workers
6358720	6361760	and all that and how Nintendo was treating contract workers was.
6361760	6362640	No, I was there.
6362640	6363120	Oh, were you?
6363760	6365040	I can't remember who was here.
6365040	6368080	Well, yeah, either that or I can listen to it.
6368080	6368560	I don't remember.
6369280	6371040	No, no, it was the week goes out.
6371040	6372160	But I was listening to the show.
6372160	6373440	That's why I remember that.
6374000	6378640	So Rama called in and then talked about, oh, I have a unique perspective on this and then
6378640	6379840	talked about how you know that.
6379840	6381760	So that's a lovely follow up.
6381760	6382720	So congratulations.
6382720	6383360	It's wonderful.
6384000	6385680	So, yeah.
6386320	6386880	Yay.
6386880	6388000	Everybody's giving applause.
6388000	6389120	There's clap emojis.
6389120	6389360	Yay.
6389360	6389680	Yay.
6389680	6392320	We're happy for DJ Rama S. Congratulations.
6392320	6393040	You did the thing.
6394320	6395200	That's it for emails.
6395200	6400240	If you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6400960	6402720	I am looking in the green room.
6402720	6403680	I don't see anyone.
6405120	6412080	And DarkSakura wants to clarify she's in chat because she's still her head is fine when
6412080	6413760	she's not trying to be on camera.
6413760	6417680	So like she can like lie down and be on the keyboard and all that stuff or whatever, like
6417680	6418960	be at a different configuration.
6418960	6423440	So she's able to let her migraine chill out and chat and not have the focus on.
6423440	6425040	So we're glad she's still there in chat.
6427680	6428800	I don't have anything else.
6428800	6430720	Do you have any last minute stories, Loki?
6431520	6433840	I was trying to find something, but it actually.
6433840	6438640	Well, I think remember it was Gold Week in Japan, so it actually was a slower Newsweek.
6438640	6441760	I mean, we still had a show full of stories, but believe it or not,
6442000	6446640	I think at this point we're kind of in that whole little waiting period until it's the
6446640	6449840	quiet before the non E3, the non E3.
6449840	6450880	But now it's going to be summer.
6452880	6453280	Why?
6453280	6454160	Oh, my God.
6454160	6458240	My watch suddenly was like, here's everything you want to know about E3.
6458880	6460240	They're dead, Siri.
6460240	6460880	They're dead.
6463200	6464960	Siri came on again and was like, Who's dead?
6466080	6468240	Anyway, how about you all in chat?
6468240	6470000	Do you have any topics you'd like us to discuss?
6470000	6472240	You know what?
6472240	6477120	Whatever is fair game tonight, whatever you want to ask us about is fair game tonight.
6478560	6478800	Yeah.
6478800	6480080	Bobby Black was like, serious.
6480080	6480720	Like, are you dead?
6480720	6481520	I will make a call.
6481520	6482080	No, I'm fine.
6482080	6482560	I'm alive.
6483200	6483760	Dark to see.
6483760	6484880	It says you got to stop doing that.
6484880	6486080	I need to turn.
6486080	6490800	I never use Siri on the watch.
6490800	6493920	I'll use it on the phone, especially in my car, because I don't want to use.
6493920	6495040	You know, I'm driving.
6495040	6496880	I'll say, like, give me directions to so and so.
6496880	6497760	But that's it.
6498720	6504240	I also use it a lot to say, set a reminder to do this, because it's so much easier than
6504240	6506400	going in and trying to actually set it on the calendar.
6506960	6507840	So there's that.
6509840	6514320	Bobby Black Wolf says, look at the summer games done quick schedule and see all the
6514320	6515120	rhythm games.
6515680	6517280	Okay, so where are we going?
6517280	6519040	Games done quick.
6519040	6519760	Oh, how about that?
6519760	6521200	It's like the first search result there.
6521200	6523280	Games done quick schedule.
6523280	6526720	All right, let's take a peek at this and see what we get.
6527440	6528400	Let's go there.
6529920	6530400	Let's see.
6531600	6537280	Oh, I didn't know they already had, like, all of the hosts were assigned stuff.
6537840	6538240	Gosh.
6538960	6540800	Okay, let's see.
6540800	6542000	Oh, they're running Mass Effect.
6542000	6542640	That's cool.
6542640	6543920	I okay.
6543920	6544560	The original.
6546720	6547440	I'm seeing.
6547440	6551440	So they said, look, Bobby says, look, yay, Blaster Master.
6551440	6552640	Sorry, I'm looking at all these games.
6552640	6554560	They said, oh, my gosh, so many good ones on the NES.
6555440	6556640	Let's see.
6556640	6557680	Where are all the music games?
6558480	6560640	I imagine they put them in a big block somewhere.
6563200	6566640	Oh, they haven't put who's announcing the games, just who's running them.
6566640	6571520	Because I'm like, I know Bobby and Froob have worked together for, like, five of these now.
6571520	6575040	I know Bobby's going to do this one unless there's something real wild happens.
6575600	6579040	So Thursday night is what Bobby says to look at.
6579600	6580960	Oh, King's Quest five.
6580960	6581460	Yay.
6582720	6583280	Let's see.
6583280	6590480	There's step mania, not itg sound voltex.
6590480	6590800	Wow.
6590800	6593040	That must be more of an expedition type of game.
6593040	6593840	That's interesting.
6595360	6596240	That's kind of neat.
6598400	6598640	Yeah.
6598640	6601120	Step mania, not itg should be interesting.
6601120	6603680	A couples exhibition, and that's going to be in person.
6604240	6604880	Wow.
6604880	6606640	Are they doing any mixing?
6607280	6608400	Copy play time.
6608400	6612720	Are they doing any mixing of the, like, hybrid stuff?
6612720	6620720	Like some people had theorized could happen is that they would actually mix the stuff
6621520	6623440	like when they needed to do a set change.
6623440	6623760	Okay.
6623760	6624000	Yeah.
6624000	6625040	Part of these are remote.
6625040	6625280	Okay.
6625280	6626320	That's what I thought.
6626320	6629680	See, I think that's a smart thing for Summer Games.
6629680	6635520	So quick to do is that in awesome games is do when they have a big set change in person
6635520	6637120	to run some of the remote stuff.
6637120	6637680	That's great.
6639200	6639600	Awesome.
6640880	6642000	So that's a good schedule.
6642000	6642720	That should be fun.
6644800	6645120	All right.
6645120	6648080	That, like, you know, I have to check out the VR stuff.
6648080	6652240	Like, they have a Half Life Alex and super hot VR looks pretty cool.
6652240	6654320	Didn't they do a Half Life Alex run last time?
6654320	6654880	What they did.
6654880	6655520	Probably.
6655520	6655920	Yeah.
6655920	6656480	I don't know.
6656480	6661920	I get all their, like, stuff through YouTube, and they do, like, a bunch of different runs
6661920	6665680	throughout the year outside of Summer Games and awesome games.
6666560	6671440	Mike Def points out Elden Ring is the closing game this year that tracks because it's new
6671440	6674480	and it's very popular, especially on the streaming services.
6675200	6677360	That's going to be a good one to close with.
6677360	6678720	I'm not surprised that at all.
6678720	6683840	You know, obviously, we're past the days of, like, Metroid being the or Super Metroid always
6683840	6686320	being the closer or something along those lines.
6686320	6688240	So, yeah, I'm not too surprised with Elden Ring.
6688240	6690560	It's only so many times you can do Super Metroid.
6690560	6695520	Well, and then there was the incident that one year and ever since then, you know, they
6695920	6699600	started saying, do we have to do this as the closer every time?
6699600	6701680	And it turns out the answer is no.
6701680	6705600	It still is a successful marathon, even when you run other games as the closing game.
6705600	6706100	So.
6706960	6707280	All right.
6707280	6711760	I do like the randomizer race or, like, the races that they do and, like, randomizer stuff.
6711760	6712320	Those are fun.
6713200	6714160	Yeah, I like those two.
6714160	6714720	Those are fun.
6715680	6716400	All right.
6716400	6720080	Well, that's going to bring us to a close for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
6720080	6723120	Thank you all so much for tuning into our show tonight.

6738720	6740560	podcast goes an awful long way.
6740560	6742640	We really appreciate all of it for sure.
6744240	6746720	And they are doing I'm sorry to interrupt.
6746720	6750240	They are doing a relay race for Super Mario Maker two.
6750240	6751520	I'm definitely going to watch that.
6751520	6752240	It's going to be awesome.
6752240	6752740	That's awesome.

6761140	6762180	We hope to see you there.
6763300	6766740	In person appearance coming up at Dragon Con again this year.
6766740	6768180	So check that out.
6768180	6770740	And there might be something coming up here locally.
6770740	6774180	I have to talk to you off air about that Loki with Dark Soccer because I got an interesting
6774180	6774500	email.
6774500	6776580	So message you about that.
6776580	6781620	So other than that, that's it.
6781620	6782580	I don't know what else to say.
6782580	6783780	It's final thought time.
6784820	6786180	Loki, do you have a final thought tonight?
6787380	6789780	I have to check out with this Kaiser Super Metroid run.
6789780	6792260	It's going to be two because I like Kaiser Mario stuff.
6792260	6795620	So Kaiser Super Metroid will be insane, I'm sure.
6796580	6796900	Yeah.
6796900	6799300	My final thought is I need to get into randomizers.
6799300	6803700	Like I've always wanted to play a Zelda randomizer or a Metroid randomizer and get into some
6803700	6806260	of the logic that comes with running those because you have to.
6806260	6809300	You know, there's a lot of thinking about this before this and this.
6809300	6810340	I want to get into those.
6810340	6811860	I've just never really made the time for it.
6811860	6814340	And I definitely need to make the time for that.
6814340	6816820	So yes, I will do that.
6818180	6818660	That's it.
6819220	6820740	We hope to see you again next week.
6820740	6821300	We'll be back.
6821300	6824660	Believe it or not, we're almost on the 20th anniversary end of June.
6824660	6826900	This show is 20 years old, if you can believe it.
6826900	6831700	And we have no idea what special thing we're doing yet, because that's how we roll here
6831700	6832820	at OLR.
6832820	6834180	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
6834180	6836100	We'll see you in seven days to do it all again.
6836100	6838900	And hopefully the gang is able to all get back together next time.
6839540	6844180	Again, a happy Mother's Day to all the moms and motherly figures out there and gamer mommies.
6845140	6847140	And I hope you all have a wonderful week.
6847140	6848260	Take care, everybody.
6848260	6849140	Have a good night.
