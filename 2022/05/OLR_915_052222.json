Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to discuss this story and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice. Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode number 915 of our show for tonight, May the 22nd of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined by my co hosts. Say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. Hi, how are you doing? I'm doing good. Good. Also joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie. Oh, she just sat down. I was gonna say she stepped away, but then she stepped back. Hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hi. Hi, you have impeccable timing. How are you? Well, I'm okay. All right. Did you go shopping this weekend? Because I see a bag with kitties on it behind you. At least that's what it looks like from a distance. Okay, I was I went earlier. And what I do is that when I go to different places, I sort them by the kind of material they are in the back of my car. Oh, so what the reason why I do that is so that I can like take a bag to my office. It's got art supplies, I can take a bag to the kitchen for food, I can take one to the bathroom for toiletries. But in this case, the stuff that goes in here usually art supplies. And I've been scouring all the Rosses I can find near me. Because I lucked into acrylic paper, which is typically something like 20 to 30 bucks for 10 sheets of paper, which and I don't know I found them for two bucks a pop. I don't know if it's a national chain, but Ross dress for less or some of my friends all over the place. Some of my friends affectionately call it cross dress for less. Well, it it just happened to have sometimes and I bought Copics they had a pack of Copic chows that had colors I didn't have so I picked them up. You can get good deals those places I get coffee finding a Copic a set of Copics is like finding a unicorn though. I get coffee supplies to those places for cheap not just the cups for like sugar free sweeteners and all that type of stuff you get cheap. That stuff's more common. Yeah. The pack of Copic markers that I paid 20 bucks for are about 35 retail. And on top of that it's a high end art supplies so we love a sale with. That's true. I was I was like, I found the pack and that now mostly I work with Copic sketch markers which are about $8 per marker. But I'm not going to say no to a pack of Copic chow like it's the same ink same quality same nibs. I was like, heck yeah, and it had a blue multi liner in it which I was looking for. So, that's cool. And I can buy canvas is really cheap there too. That's good because there's no, no longer there used to be an art supply store that was everywhere called Aaron brothers my mom that was my mom's favorite store because they're Aaron brothers is hardly an art supply store, well but they're they're they did framing and they're no longer anyway they went out, they all went under. So, yeah, I just remember there's still loved going there. I think university artists still around so is a blix art supply which is a bigger chain and they are dedicated art. There's, I actually I buy Copics at Michael's of all places because the Joanne's here doesn't have a very good selection. And the Michaels actually does, and they'll sometimes do like a buy one get one half price. And for Copics that's unbelievable. Well believe it or not it's a video game podcast but you know what we know that you want sales on all the merchandise to make your fan art. So when you all out there are celebrating the dead by daylight dating sim that's coming out we'll talk about later in the show or is literally doing dead by daylight fan art is dark soccer showing off on stream, because we do take live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific, and they can catch the VOD if they want to see it twitch.tv slash vog network that's VOG network, and we'll talk about deals for all sorts of things. We also sometimes talk about other types of media, not just video games, but Loki I can't help but notice you've got a classic eight bit Disney game playing behind you because there were, there were some really good like Capcom had the Disney license for games in the job with they made some great Mickey Mouse could pay DuckTales of course all 10 classics but you plan tonight, rescue. Yeah, I have a feeling this has to do with that movie that just came out a few days ago. Because it's up. Go ahead. Absolutely fantastic. Yes, I'm seeing it all over the game blogs because I guess they brought back the Sonic the hedgehog that everybody hated from the original trailer and they call them ugly. Yes, but I was laughing because ugly Sonic apparently does appearances at fan conventions now and I was just laughing because that's just like that's such a like I haven't even seen the movie, but that's just like such a thing for ugly Sonic to do to capitalize on that one appearance that they made and believe me, you all know I do multiple things I don't just host to LR I've met a lot of people in my other gig that try to make that one appearance that they did last for a long time. What I will, I will, I will just say two words that will illustrate this point very well. Miss Vangie. Well, that's that's that's an entire empire based off of a infamous exit. But okay, so but it's not even though all the gaming blogs are talking about ugly Sonic. My understanding is the movie just consistently throws like, like that's every Gen X millennial like Zillennial or the trail generation like that, like the our age basically references everywhere. They integrate the pop culture like cartoon and live action stuff, and like even like CG puppets, like all sorts of things together in like one cohesive world. It's not like Space Jam where it's like, hey, you remember that? Hey, you remember that? Like it actually makes sense like in the world and, and they make fun of things that it's, it's hilarious. The premise is hilarious. Just like the jokes are ridiculous in a lot of the things. I don't know. It's like, I know when I saw like the trailer for the movie, I was like, you know, I like Andy Samberg. I like Oh, gosh, I can't remember the other guy's name. Um, we don't like that much. No, I can John Mulaney. So I, so I like their work a lot. Like they're great writers on SNL. They have a lot of really funny stuff that they do in that. And like, there is just like, it just comes like all of their like personality comes out and all these characters and stuff and they just it's it's hilarious, like the different like characters that they bring back and like just the whole bunch of stuff. The whole plot line. Everything is ridiculous. And some of the gags that they do even like with the ugly Sonic stuff. It's just, it's hilarious. It's all hilarious. It's so good. Like, I don't know. Like I was watching as like, this is why is it this good? Like this is ridiculous. It shouldn't even be this good. Um, DJ rama. I'm sorry. Let me get some several comments in our chat room. sj 100. Matt says is the movie good. It looked totally trashy in the sense that it knows it's trashy and it's just joking on itself. DJ rama says there's some cringe but overall it was really good. The remake of the rescue Rangers theme is trash though. Mike Deaf says it was okay for me not that great but funny and entertaining way better than Space Jam two. So there is that that is a low bar to hit but yes. All right, well, I'll check it out ways but I'm a sucker for good reference. Somebody sent me there's like a billboard in the background that shows Doug from Nickelodeon's Doug is now a lawyer and like the gag was really funny. It said something like there's nothing funny about injury because his name was Doug funny. And it's Yes. And that was that was funny. So there's a lot of that stuff. There's absolutely a ton of that stuff. There's a joke that's about like, it's, you know, like the Batman Superman stuff. Well, this one's like Batman versus et. And then they they they see see that on a billboard and then they come back like immediately right after that and actually show a clip of the movie. And it's so stupid. I'm a sucker. It's great. I'm a sucker for a quick hit pun. Like I'm for a quick hit. There's so many why I loved Mitch Hedberg. Like that was the entire routine. It feels a little bit like like, I don't want to not really necessarily compare it to the Zucker Brothers stuff. But it's kind of like that where there's a lot of just like gags in the background and some of this stuff. Like if you don't like notice it, you might like miss a joke. Like I was laughing throughout the movie like a bunch of things that my kids like they don't get the reference because of like half the stuff in there. I was gonna say some of the soccer movie stuff is kind of lame. Some of it is classic, obviously, like some of the old school stuff is classic. Like but then I thought like, Oh, but they did the later scary movies, movies after the Wayans brothers, right? Because like the way I don't want to, but the later I don't want to spoil too much, but like, so like zipper and gadget end up like becoming a couple. And so they have a family. So you have to imagine, well, how's that work? A fly and a mouse? Well, they elaborate on that. And it's hilarious. All right. All right. I have to check it out some way. Sounds funny. Yeah. All right. Let's get into video games. I know. I know. But we got it. We got to talk about video games, or we're not allowed to call ourselves a video game podcast. But you know what, there's there's lots of platforms out there with media that are dipping their toe into gaming. And I think that's gonna do our kickoff topic for tonight. Loki, what do we got? Yeah, so tick tock has already, they're adding games to their platform, because, you know, they want to get people on that platform, and they want to stay there. So they've added a few small games, and they're planning to roll out more games as part of I guess, Southeast Asia later this year. Right now, they are. I don't really have that many games added in there. They have, I guess, was a disco loco 3d. It's a game from Zynga. And then they also have like some other like free to play stuff. It's a lot of mobile games like Marvel snap. So yeah, they're going to be incorporating more games into the platform. I don't know how that necessarily like, is it just that you can go play games there? Or is it like, does that integrate with the platform somehow? Like, I'd be curious to see what that means. Like, are you sharing clips of the games? I mean, like, what is it? I imagine it integrates with the platform a little bit. It's kind of it kind of reminds me of when Facebook was kind of doing this through messenger. And I think to some extent, they still have it. But I know they were pushing it pretty hard for a little bit is that in messenger, you could just like jump right into a game of Pac Man or something like that, where you actually but it was like a Pac Man competing against the other person type of thing. By the way, happy birthday, Pac Man. Maybe that's why it's on my my brain tonight. But I think this is something like that is that it probably is still launched within the tick tock app. But it is more of a gaming experience. I mean, if it was smart, they would allow you to share clips and things like that. But I don't know, I would think a lot of the success of this depends on the quality of the game. There's a lot of mobile games that have a reputation for being crappy mobile games. That's why I think when Facebook had Pac Man, it was interesting, because Pac Man has a reputation behind it. Everybody knows what Pac Man is, you know, if tick tock got Mario Kart, people would pay attention. Yeah, even Mario Kart mobile wasn't as good as the mainline games, but I digress. You know, I don't know if tick tocks going to really break through if the games don't get people to notice. You know what I mean? No, I get what you're saying. And yeah, I don't know if they're going to be I mean, they mentioned a game. So it's like, I don't know, maybe like, I mean, they might they might do that. Okay, so I think about like, it take talk as a platform really makes its living. I don't know what else to call it off of people endlessly watching. That's it's they make they make their money off of people's off of content creators stealing stuff from people of color, and then calling it their own and then making it popular. So take talk gets more revenue. Oh, that's that's any platform. That's Instagram as well. That's that's any any that's Twitter. It's all Don't be dismissive about it, though. It's a very big thing. I'm not being dismissive about it. Excuse me. I'm pointing out that this is a problem on every social media platform. It's not something that's unique to My point was that tik tok has been very recently called out on it. And it's been big news specifically on them very recently. Um, now I lost my train of thought, but people tend to just kind of endlessly watch tik toks, you know, one after the other. And I think Instagram is a very similar sort of thing like Instagram stories or whatever it is. And on Instagram, I know that you will see ads because I do chuckle. I will often see these ridiculous looking game ads where I know I know the game is nothing like the ad, because there's a lot of those ad will show like, I don't know the the mafia guy stealing someone's stealing someone's girlfriend or something. And then they drive off together and they're being chased by zombies and all these ludicrous things. You know, the game looks nothing like it. But the stories. Oh, God, what was the other one? There was one where like Kathy Bates was in the ad, and it made all this news. I think we even talked about it on the show. And like, it's a fucking match three puzzle game. But the ad was so over that was like grandma's mystery mansion or something. I don't want to give the game free advertisement anyway. But like it's like these ads are so ludicrous. And they're telling you to tap to download the game, which I bet a lot of people don't do. Maybe some because the ads are so silly. But in tik tok, and this whole integration thing, I would imagine as you're endlessly scrolling tik tok content, you're going to come across, you know, an ad or something, and it's just click here to play now. And I think that will probably be something that is what they're going to do is have it so you just click and play the game right now. But again, I think if the games aren't interesting, nobody's going to really care. I also, you know, one thing I see on again, it doesn't matter what the platform is, it's something that you know, it hits in one place, and it spreads everywhere is these filters, right? See it on Instagram, Snapchat, tik tok, they all have some version of it, where, you know, you see the filter. And it's like, I don't know what what Pokemon or what what Pokemon is my team. And it shows like six random Pokemon that go over your head, and you sit there and react to your team. And people watch that. It's like, oh, yay, I got a team I like or Oh, I got all pidgeys and rotatas. That's garbage. You know, people will watch that stuff for whatever reason. Because we're bored. But what if there's a game somehow out of those filters? That's where I thought maybe it would go is that you you play the game and watch people react live to it. Kind of like twitches mo or YouTube's I guess a certain component of that. But I would I would think maybe there's something there. I'm surprised when I heard tik tok is getting into gaming. It wasn't just, oh, they're trying to throw games at it like Facebook did like Netflix is doing all this stuff. I'm surprised it wasn't like they're trying to do something different with it. They're trying to gamify something they're already doing. But as pointed out earlier, all of these platforms all steal from each other. Anyway, so there's that. Let's see. DJ Rama S and chat says, I like tik tok better when it was called vine. Honestly, yes. RIP vine ahead of its time. And I don't know how Twitter ran that out of business. But they sure did. Because right. Twitter bought vine, didn't they? Or my parents go though. There was that to Twitter ran that out of business, too. So I don't, I don't know what happened there. But no vine was great. But this it was okay. So I just said earlier, I love a quick hit joke. And that's all vine was. You didn't have a lot of time on vine to set something else up. tik toks let you go longer. Instagram, Snapchat, they'll let you go longer. They just poked me for 10 minute videos. On on tik tok, you can do 10 minute videos on tik tok. No, they said they're they're rolling out 10 minute videos. Like I was in the five minute crowd. And I mean, really, all I put on there is just like, stuff I did in dead by daylight to advertise my channel. And then, like pinball stuff when I went to Golden State pinball Expo. But there's people who go on there to I don't even know. It's, I don't think these people are very interesting. Like people show stuff. And I'm like, it's not very funny. But then again, I don't think a lot of people are funny. Um, yeah, tick, tick tock's hard for me to get into, like, and I just wonder, like, is this an age thing? I don't know. Tick tock doesn't, I don't see a lot of content from people I know on it. Like, at least if I'm doing Instagram, or Snapchat, although a lot of my friends don't really use Snapchat. But like, I see people I know, and their content, tick tock, I I'll see, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival. But it's like, I'll see that something Paula Abdul posted, she's great. One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival. But it's like, I'll see that something Paula Abdul posted, she's great. One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival When you see her Horse and stuff, it's like, it's all thirst-trapped stuff When you see her Horse and stuff, it's like, it's all thirst-trapped stuff Um, then, like her YouTube and Instagram is all pimple popping things Yeah, but it starts to learn what you like Yeah, but it starts to learn what you like Don't knock it. I watch those too those platforms start to learn what you're engaging with and then it keeps showing you more of that, for better or for worse You know, that's what a lot of social media platforms do do. So, um, bonds, double six says have never viewed seen anything connected to tick tock. It's getting hard to escape. I have a hard time figuring out the secret sauce with tick tock. I have an account. I made one video because a local artist friend was like, you should get on it and make a video. And so we made a video together backstage to show. And I thought it was I thought it was stupid. Like I like not it was not this other artists. I made the joke or whatever. And I thought it was stupid. It did get a lot of views for being a throwaway video. And I was like, what the hell? You know, I don't understand this thing. But I don't I don't know what content to make for it. I really don't. So I don't know. Maybe I'll figure that out someday. I just some of these names people have the names on tik tok. Yeah, like Lord Panda waffles. I just saw that name just now. And I think it's a great name. That's Yeah, I mean, it is a great name. A lot of MMO is in video games. You see silly gamer tags and stuff too. I saw I saw a sassy pants. Give it a on in another game. Well, they're a fake fake bitch. sassy pants, by the way, was the name of my old Warcraft character for those who don't know. Let's see Zen monkey 11 says the secret sauce is it short and to the point. You don't have to be that short though. Because I've, you know, again, you just talked about the 10 minute videos, the five minute videos. So yeah, be that short. Like vine was short and to the point. I would say I've definitely skipped past my fair share of tik tok videos because too too long to build up. It's just like the same problem with a lot of youtubes too because the first minute will be Hey, everybody, welcome to my YouTube channel. If you want to keep the channel going. Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe. And today, a lot of them though have chapter markers on them now though. So that makes it better. That's good. We know I can skip the sheer space ads. See, bonds double six says at work now watching anime when I'm not working at some gaming or just regular adulting things. So all right. Yes, enough though. I am that person who pulls up YouTube to watch documentaries. Well, there is I mean, there is no shortage of all sorts of content on there. And there's some great gaming documentaries on there too. Like, I think of the Final Fantasy 14 1.0 documentary that's on there. That's really good. You know, like, I like stuff like Did you know gaming and you know, unseen 64. And I actually watched a really good one today about Stephen King stint as Richard Bachman, where the name came from, why he did it and about the controversy by the book rage. And it was a 20 minute video. And it gave the information and it was actually a really good video. Those are the that's what I go to watch is stuff that's going to teach me something. Well, for better or for worse, a site like YouTube with the search bar has everything. You know, if you need to know how to fix something, their algorithm sucks. Yeah, they will show you the same video you watched two months ago. Don't you want to see it again? All right. So until we have more, I guess that's all there is to say on Tick Tock getting into gaming is that they're testing it. I just don't know how much engagement they're really going to get with it unless they literally just dropped the game right in front of you as you're scrolling through all these endless things as you're looking at Tick Tock, I don't know. So yeah, I would have to like, you know, it. I don't know if they're doing anything meaningful with it, aside from just like, okay, we're going to advertise games on there. And then we'll split the revenue with whatever you guys sell or make off of it. Like, I don't know, I, I just don't see them doing anything meaningful with it. So far, like the other platforms, I've tried to integrate that stuff like Facebook and whatnot, haven't really done too much. Yeah, it's like, we'll have this news cycle. And then Oh, turns out, nobody's really engaging with it. So yeah, isn't that kind of true about Facebook gaming, the live streaming section to like, they, they, they'll get in the news, because it's like, oh, they've got all these creators. And as much as I don't really care for Facebook, but I also realized, like, I have to check it every now and then, or I'll miss people's major, like, I'll miss that people are getting married, and that type of stuff. So I'll load it up. But like, never, never do I see on my Facebook feed anything about Facebook gaming. And you would think Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna watch it anyway. But you would think they'd be trying to target me a little bit. It's weird. Anyway. All right. Well, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week, the things we've been doing that aren't tick tock. How was your gaming week Dark Soccer? We'll start with you. Um, Terranigma is getting a little bit more interesting, although it's like still a fairly simple game. Like, the story is interesting, but it's so fucking weird. And like, I did have something good happen, like in in my my last stream, it was pretty cool. You have to go find this girl and they allude that she's surrounding herself with illusions. And then when you when you find her and you talk to the people in the town, and everyone's nice and you lay down at the end, and you wake up and there's all zombies trying to eat you and you can you can shoot their heads off and tables fly at you. And you there's these ghosts, like things that look almost like they almost remind me of Jomon pottery. But if you hit them, these ghosts come out and they like try they suck you back to the beginning of the level. So I've been using my safe states a lot. And like, you have to go find this girl's dog and all this stuff. And it's just this weird sort of denial thing going on in her with her little world of zombies. And I haven't found the girl yet. I think I did something out of turn. But it's a it's a really, the game has more depth than I thought it did at the beginning, even if the delivery is a little bit. Hmm. Awkward. Awkward delivery, I can put it forth like that, like you do. Like you wake up this one thing like you wake up all the animals in the world. And then suddenly you can talk to the animals and you have this weird cutscene that doesn't make any sense. And I just a lot of it just is really awkward. And I can see why it didn't come out over here. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but I have played better put together games in general. The music is is okay. There have been some pieces that I translate them as really bad. So they're interesting to listen to. Like the instrumentation and some of them is weird. And I found some music I really enjoyed and I like the animations for the main character arc. And I like his little like, purple blob thing that just shows up out of out of nowhere to be sarcastic to him named Yomi. So I'm enjoying the game. It's just not what I expected it to be. But it's it's pretty fun. I'm so I'm gonna keep up with it. I mean, I think I'm kind of pushing through it at a good pace. And of course, Dead by Daylight. I play I ended up like I don't even know what my deal was yesterday, but I could not play my best characters to save my life. And then I'm actually starting to see now where I'm getting loading screen lag that a lot of people on Steam are also getting and the rubber banding that they've been talking about. Where it's like, you you're chasing after someone, for example, and then it snaps, like it snaps you back, like another position like you've been pulled back by rubber band. And I don't know what it is, because Finara and I were talking about it. And Finara, I will be getting to that. Thank you. Is that the toxic survivors, the bully squads have been out in force. And although I did have something really funny happen on Thursday, I finally got to play Haddonfield, which I haven't, I haven't played it yet, except for the time Finara and I ran around exploring. And it was clear, I didn't know where I was going. And the survivors started to be, you know, bullyish and everything. And as I like to say, they fucked around and found out. They got sloppy, I got on my game. One person disconnected to, to Death Hooks. And I felt sorry for the UE at the end and I let her escape. I let her get the hatch. I couldn't find the hatch though. That Haddonfield level is small, but weird. I don't hate it. But I miss old Haddonfield and I never thought I would say that. Yeah, it's very different. But other than that, I've been watching people on the PTB. The dredge, haha. That, that's a very interesting character concept. And I super love it, except he just, he reminds me a little bit of some of the scenes from The Thing. And that is a movie I cannot watch because I had bad nightmares about it. Like I cannot watch that movie and the dredge makes me think a little bit of it. But the locker teleporting mechanic is really cool. And now, you know, I'm a lore nerd. I've probably read through everybody's stories and the extra things. And I really liked that they brought Hattie into it because she was mentioned in three other tomes before we even saw her. And then there was like the Jacob person that she was writing to also mentioned in the lore. And then I think there was something about the person who basically created the doctor. So I really think that now they're starting to look a little bit more to their actual lore and starting to tie it all together. Because I think that there's a big contingent of us that's really into the lore. And we want to see these things, we want them to expand on it. Well, I did also buy another game and I cannot play it. I bought Evil Dead. Right now, now it's only on Epic Games Store if you want it on a non console. And they marked it down to like 39. And then they're doing like some mega sale right now where you can get a $10 off coupon. So I paid 30 bucks for the game. So I'm not going to return it. But it won't run in Windows 11 arm. It doesn't the x64 emulation is not where it should be to run that game. Of course, I still have the same problem with Dead by Daylight that I know the game will run. I know the game will work. It's the anti cheat that they use that won't run and the game will not run without the anti cheat. So I'm hoping that the Evil Dead comes out on Stadia because I'll probably buy it again. It looked like I watched LC play it last night. It was that shit. It's intense. And it looked like it was a lot of fun. So I'm one of these days I'll get to play it but I did put a lot of attention into it. So that's right out in word scapes like I'm number 12 in the tournament today. So whatever. All right. Loki, we'll go to you. How was your gaming week? I was just Minecraft again. So I put out a new hardcore video. And then I've been trying to get a farm, a raid farm to work, or at least a stacking rate farm to work. But the server that we play on, it had its runs what's called paper MC and paper tends to mess with technical redstone stuff. And so I built the farm up and it didn't work quite right. So I had to tear it all down again. And so now I'm researching new farm designs to build. So there's that. Um, what else? Oh, I got this cool new t shirt. I gotta show you. So you're gonna love this. I mean, so check this out. See if we can move my mic. Was that a pyramid head? I can't tell. No. Yeah, your green screen is green is the virtual green screen. Here, we'll fix that real quick. All right. And by the way, can I mention one thing that I forgot to? Yeah. I chased finara around in cold wind farm so I could practice nurse. Oh, fun. And listening to a thing screen makes me happy. Oh, gosh, that's also okay. So that's like, that's the background for dropout. The old DDR song. It is. Oh, wow. That's that is. Where did you get that shirt from? T Republic, I believe. I'm gonna have to look at that. Yeah, that's, that's a throwback. My gosh. Yeah. Yeah. It was from they just sent me an email. I think it's frontier public. I'm a little shocked that I recognized it, but also not. All right. Anything else? I thought I had to get it. Anything else? That that's basically it. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. My gaming week. I've been playing more fun fancy 14 because of course I have been. I've been playing a little bit of dead by daylight as well. I've been sort of trying to get back into killer a little bit. I have found that I kind of enjoyed playing the plague right now in dead by daylight. I feel like she inherently counters a lot of the meta plays that survivors use right now. Because like, healing circle of healing doesn't really matter with her. Because her mechanic is the whole cleansing and everything anyway, anyway, dead hard. You can still vomit on them if they did hard. So there's there's a lot that, you know, kind of works with her that I find very fun. I just find most survivors aren't prepared for her. So that's the fun thing about playing her not to say I got some four K's I get some no K's just you know, kind of goes back and forth. My luck with her. He always used to throw me off because of how tall she is. Oh, yeah, there's that. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Ah, let's see. And then in other games, so I'm continuing my, you know, adventures in AR gaming and like Pikmin. I'm level 57 in Pikmin Bloom now. So I've walked a lot of steps. I just walked three and a half miles today in the heat. So that's, that's been you know, I don't know, because that's a very passive type of game. I don't do a lot in that game. But they had a big community day because Niantic had a big community day this weekend. And actually, some of my friends through Ingress, we decided to meet up in Oakland. Because well, they weren't doing anything for Ingress, but we all play the other stuff too. So we decided to do Pikmin there and they were doing Pokemon Go had a community day. So they were doing Alolan Geodude as well. Oh, yeah, Mike Defton chat says all the community days. Well, Niantic Niantic starting to lean into that a little bit. And they actually they even have a whole website for community day. And they're they've launched a whole brand around it. So Niantic actually had a booth in Oakland. And so it was it was considered one of the like Niantic attended events. They did some virtual events, but this was like Niantic intended, attended. So they had a booth set up with like, it was just silly stuff like pins, but one of the pins I got was a Niantic community day pin with that new logo on it and everything. So I mean, they're they're leaning into the brand. They had like Wayfarer stickers and stuff. So you can kind of see all their their new products are trying to kind of fold into their brand in different ways. And then, yeah, so I did the community day there and just, you know, walked around a little bit. It was interesting because they had, they put in like 10 fake pokey stops right in that Jack London Square, which is a pretty decently populated area with pokey stops anyway. And they added like 10 more. So it was like I was just sitting there because I use the Bluetooth and when I ran out of pokey balls, I just switch it to only spin stops. And within like 10 minutes, I probably had 100 pokey balls again. So it's also interesting. And we'll get into some of the Niantic controversy later. But it is very interesting how they can set up fake pokey stops whenever they want wherever they want. So it's that part of it's kind of interesting. But it was honestly like I it was kind of lame for Pikmin though, because Pikmin didn't generate the flower spawns. It didn't generate off the the stops that they made for the event. So it was like there wasn't very many places to spawn flowers. So it was really just Pokemon. And so for my friends they play Pikmin and Ingress, they don't really play Pokemon. They were a little bit like, there's not much to do. But it was fun to see everybody and hang out together. And I guess that's that's the fun in it. So yeah, so outside of that, don't really have a lot else to share. I Oh, no, I guess I could mention that Pokemon home got an upgrade. Because now Pokemon home will work with Arceus and brilliant diamond shining pearl. So all I've really done so far as I went into home to like organize some stuff and do a little bit of transfers, I upgraded my save files and did the transfers to get the bonus Pokemon that they're given away for the home upgrade. But if you're a Pokemon person, and you like home at all, just check out that that all got upgraded to 2.0. And now you can use it with the two latest Pokemon releases, because you can only use it with really sword and shield and go and and transferring stuff all the way from bank before you can really use it with the newer games, but they've now patched it in. So you can use it with the newer releases. So that kind of makes that stuff fresh again, I really need to go back and beat Pokemon Arceus because that was all right when I was moving. So I was really into it for like a week. And then it was like the move took over and I never went back to it. So I need to do that at some point. All right, let's get into some more news. Not a lot of housekeeping stuff. But I will mention because we're getting close now. We're only a month away from our 20th anniversary here of Orange Launch Radio, we celebrate 20 years on the air for better. And for worse. At the end of June, June 26 will be that show are technically our birthday is June 23. But that would be in the middle of the week. So we're going to do a celebrate all that on June the 26th. So be here. All right. Let's talk about news and what else is going on in the gaming world. Loki? Yeah, so apparently, the word is that EA is looking for somebody to swoop in and purchase them. Because you know, hey, that's what's happening. So they said in recent years, as media companies have taken greater interest in the rapidly growing gaming industry. Electronic Arts have held talks with a number of different potential suitors, including Disney, Apple and Amazon. Several sources with these talks say EA has been persistent in pursuing a sale and has only grown more emboldened in the wake of the Microsoft Activision deal. Yeah, but like, maybe they don't like don't have the offer they're like your games like Battlefield hasn't been doing well. Madden stuff, I guess it's all right. You just lost your FIFA license, or maybe just didn't renew your FIFA license, whatever. So I don't know. I don't know if anyone will will purchase them. But I guess they're just saying, Hey, we're out here, waiting for you to purchase us. Well, that's the I guess that list of suitors is kind of interesting. I mean, because they're not really companies you think about with gaming. I mean, I get the Apple one I get because I see where they've got gaming, the Disney one, I guess Disney did have some game publishing. Yeah, yeah, they're interested in more licensing than developing their games. So so but then the Comcast one is very like, I mean, a lot of people are quick to point out, you know, the two most hated companies in America are probably Comcast and EA. You know, if you look at those, you know, when when it comes to battle for the Oh, who's the worst company in the world? It's usually those two are towards the top of the list. So it was just together we can be the worst we'll combine our powers of being the worst to be the even worse company. I don't know. I'm, I'm not sure how EA would fit into that unless Comcast to be more worse or rare, unless Comcast wants to start publishing games. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know where that fits in with it. Well, it's not gonna happen anyway. But it could it could be that they just want to be purchased and then they could still be making games but just like owned by another company kind of like how we just had the acquisitions with some of Square Enix's properties, where they're owned by another company now, then they're still making games. It's just they're not making games for Square Enix anymore. There. There's another parent company that basically owns them. Yeah, it'd be nice if someone threw billions of dollars your way, but unfortunately, that's not happening right now. Would it be like a big deal if Sony purchased them? Um, I don't know me No, I am. But yeah, probably. Personally, it's gonna be different for everyone. Will it make huge news in the industry? Absolutely. But it sounds to me and especially kind of based on you know, the the feedback of the EA feels emboldened by the Activision Microsoft thing. I would bet EA is trying to ask for too much money for what they're really worth. And you kind of are pointing out that a lot of their longtime franchises are not exactly taking a turn for the better. And as more and more people are getting burned out on the whole loot box thing and you see more regulation with that when EA says this is where we make most of our money. I think buying EA could be a dangerous prospect for many people right now, especially now that they just lost the FIFA license. And although I think most of us that don't think that they net Yeah, I think that they I think with FIFA, they're just now just licensing the football clubs. And if you let me get to the point I would have, but most of the, you know, the the EA stuff, they'll be fine without FIFA, I really do think they will be. But just the fact that they are they lost that is not a great look, you know, for a company that's trying to sell themselves. Now they can't say and we've got FIFA license for it, because they don't have it anymore. You know, so I guess I think they'll be fine. Those of us that have followed the industry in those games for a while. Yes, they've, they've partnered with other soccer clubs. And I really think FIFA will probably lose more from that deal than EA will, but that's that's on them. So yeah, they'll be fine. But I'm not sure investors see it that way. We got this other company Konami, they're gonna make a soccer game. It's gonna be amazing. Oh, wait. Talk about somebody who ought to be sold. But that's a whole nother story, I suppose. So I must talk about a company that doesn't have anything of value anymore. Uh, quest buster and chat says from what I've read, the game industry will blow past 200 billion in revenues by 2024, which could partially explain why a company like Comcast once an in Vivendi specialty is entertainment media like canal plus in France, but once upon a time they owned Activision Blizzard. Yes, it actually was not that long ago, really. So yeah, it's very true. S2100. Matt says I could have seen it. The EA game console presented by Comcast, a cloud gaming console that won't be subjected to bandwidth caps. I hate that idea so much, but I could see it. For sure. So thanks. I hate it. Thanks. I hate it. Yep, pretty much. Yeah, we'll see. I mean, if they decide to sell. But meanwhile, there's other stuff going on at EA, right? Yeah, so along with that consolidation, with the losing or not renewing their contract with FIFA, they are now having layoffs at EA Austin, where they're dropping 200 or more customer support staff that have been helping out with stuff there. Again, not a great Well, I don't know sometimes cutting back. I hate I hate to say it that way. Because, you know, these are people that lost their jobs and so forth. But I'm just speaking strictly like the investor side of things. Those sort of cutbacks make a company a little more lucrative to that sort of stuff, too. Yeah, basically, they're taking it from in house and they're going to be using a third party, I guess, which means 100% full stop guaranteed customer service is only going to get worse. Absolutely, it will get worse. Because if you think customer service doesn't do shit for you now, when it comes to restoring old accounts, or you were banned inappropriately, just wait until a third party does it that doesn't even have the proper access to they're going to Romania and India. They Oh, this is gonna be garbage, like, good fucking luck for those of you that have a lot invested in EA online games. You know, I don't know, maybe if you if you're playing Star Wars, the old republic or something that like you're continuously hitting EA products, or maybe dropping a lot of money on FIFA or what have you. Good fucking luck if you need customer service help, because that's Oh, boy, that's gonna be rough. Anyway, let's talk about a gaming series, the dark soccer and I talk a little bit about on this show just a tad, a little a little bit. So we're gonna talk a little bit about dead by daylight. But that's because there's actually a lot of news going on with dead by daylight is that they just had their six anniversary celebration stream, you know, kind of announcing what's coming up for the sixth anniversary event that's happening in June, where dark soccer kind of already referenced, you have a new killer, you have a new survivor that are on the public test build right now. But did you watch the whole thing? No, I didn't watch any of it. I only read secondhand the cliff notes. I watched all of it. Yeah, well, I was working so I couldn't I couldn't watch it. But I watched it after the fact. Okay, that's cool. Yeah. Um, but I did see this trailer and something that came a little bit out of left field a little bit not. But I think for those that hadn't been paying attention to every little rumor, this did come out of left field. And that is that dead by daylight is officially launching a dating sim. And it's called hooked on you, which is a very tongue on tongue in cheek name. Because of course, in dead by daylight, if you're a killer, you are placing survivors on a hook. If you're a killer, you're a hooker. Yeah. So hooked on you is the name of the obviously there's that play on dating. This is being made by psy op, who made the I love you Colonel Sanders dating sim. So you know, this is a company that got a pedigree. Yeah, they would. They're gonna do fine with it. They interviewed the guy behind it. And he was absolutely hilarious. He's like, Well, I know this is normally serious and very lethal. And we want to pay respect for that. But let's make it silly. It was it was actually really worth watching. That's cool. Um, yeah. And it this is just funny to me. Because if you go to the dead by daylight, Twitter, which it has a weird name, you would think they'd just be at dead by daylight, but it's like, D by behavior, so dead by behavior, bh vr. Yeah. So you have to go to that Twitter. If you look at the replies to literally any tweet they've ever posted, the replies will always have in the one of the first five replies will always be when are you adding sex to dead by daylight or sex when or when can I sex Dwight or you know, David or whoever is the killer or survivor being posted about. And I feel like in a way as much as this daylight, or excuse me, this dead by daylight dating sim is funny and good news. I feel like it's rewarding that behavior on Twitter is that all those people not a little bit not that you're gonna have sex in this game, but I do feel that those people are vindicated a little bit, which kind of irritates me. So but anyway, um, on a murderer's island, we're hooked on you takes place, you will get to know four of the killers in the game, the trapper huntress, wraith and spirit. And you will romance them and apparently might be wondering which survivor Do you play as my understanding is you play as yourself. You don't play as a survivor. So the survivors flat out you play as an original character. Yeah. So the survivors may show up in cameos or something, but you're gonna play as yourself. And it's gonna be in a locker. Yeah. And there's, you know, there's men and women. So it's a for four people. It's a pretty diverse lineup there. It's all dead by daylight behavior entertainment originals. So you're not going to be romancing Mike Myers or Freddie or any of that stuff. But I'm sure we can all understand why, you know, those licenses only go so far, they would have to license those care. So if this dating sim does really well, maybe we'll get nemesis in it because it seems like Capcom is very eager to license right now. The one thing we haven't talked about, they also confirmed a second resident evil DLC is on the way, which getting Ada Wong, which has not happened for with it. Technically, they haven't confirmed that. But wink, wink, nudge, nudge, the leakers that said this was coming said it's Ada Wong and Wesker. And the trailer VD leaks has been fairly accurate. And the information I mean, it's called project W and the trailer was just screaming that it's Wesker. So I don't see Yeah, how Yeah, so I'm sure I'm sure it is Ada Wong. It's a bummer. I don't I guess it's not to though. It's just Oh, no, it is to it's somebody from Resident Evil zero. It's another feet. Rebecca or something right was the other way back chambers. She's actually was in the first Resident Evil. Okay, okay. My bad. She was when you played through Chris's game. She was his kind of sidekick back and forth. And played the piano for that one scene and and she was though in another game with was it Carlos? Some other guy. Oh, she's also in zero says Mike Depp. Okay, so we're both right. That's my fan. Um, it's I'm a little bummed that Chris is not going to be a fully fledged character. He's always just going to be an alternate Leon, but whatever. I guess you can't win them all. So. But yeah, so there's another Resident Evil DLC coming. Also, I really wanted the killer to be Lady Dimitrescu. And I know I know Wesker. I know Wesker is maybe a third one show. Yeah, maybe a third one since apparently Capcom is, you know, bargain basementing that out right now. But I imagine it's I imagine that DLC sold really well. And it's probably done a lot for you know, people love it. So I think probably sees the win there. Don't forget about the other news with that they're going to be doing revamps to RuPaul's Drag Station. Oh, the Raccoon City Police Department, the worst map. Yeah, that needs that is not the worst map. It's my favorite map to play on his pig and Freddie as the worst map for a survivor, I think. Well, I don't know. No, a lot of survivors love it because they it's like a terrible map for because of the library. That's it because of the library. But I love getting RPD as pig. It's like my favorite thing is getting RPD as pig. So well, how do you feel that they're reworking it? Because it might not go and, you know, I know you love to do the extra trap and all that stuff to get survivors in that map, but they may did actually play this trap or two and it was pretty fun. But I think that I want them to keep this original layout like they have but if they do other maps that you have a chance to get that maybe have different things restricted or different openings or different pathways, you know, kind of like how there's like what 50,000 versions of batam. Yeah. And they all are pretty much the fucking same. I think this is gonna be more of that. I honestly do. Oh, there's more pulsing shit everywhere. Oh, this there's a tentacle in the wall. Oh, I'm so scared. Oh, no. Oh, this one doesn't have the hole in the wall from the helicopter. Ooh. I would like to see another Silent Hill DLC. But I don't know what other killer they could put. Because they made the most obvious one a survivor. I would want them to do like the original mansion. I know it's too big, but I would like for them to do like different areas of the mansion. Cool. Cool. From the first Resident Evil. And if they did a Silent Hill one, I would want it to be the mall that Heather is trapped in in Silent Hill three. It's just the room Cheryl, Heather, Cheryl, whatever. Now, um, I don't know if we have a release date for hooked on you. We just know it's Oh, later this summer. That's what we know. And that it's coming to steam. So I don't think we have any other platforms yet. But you know, the going theory is July. Yeah. Which would make sense. That's right around their anniversary and all that stuff. Now, Loki, I know you don't get into Dead by Daylight the same way Dark Soccer and I do. But I have to ask, could a dating sim sell you on Dead by Daylight? No. Why not? You're no fun. I don't really play dating sims. So that wouldn't really maybe your wife would get into Dead by Daylight. Probably not. All right. Dark Soccer. I'm sure you'll be sure I'm sure every Dead by Daylight streamer you and I both know will be streaming this but I'm sure you're going to stream it as well. Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. All right. Coming whenever they finish it, I guess. All right. In the meantime, I'm sure it's pretty much done. What I want to do those I want to see it actually be successful. So that they bring out more characters. Yeah, DLC. Do you remember when I was into the guy I can't remember what company it was had the dating sim but I played all the Homestuck characters. And it was all web based. And they took it down. I was really mad and I paid for it too. Well, and if it does, I can't remember the name. I was just gonna say if it does well, DBD will probably cross over into other types of games too. I mean, this Namco Hi, thank you, Dark Tessa. This is hot on the heels of the Dead by Daylight board game too. So, you know, which I ordered this. And I think if that does well, and this does well, I think you're just going to see DVD as a franchise grow into other places too. Which could be interesting. Maybe Loki, would you play the Dead by Daylight board game with us? Maybe I want to do a live play of the board game when mine arrives. I'll try it. Yeah, we could do that. I'll try it. And I ordered the full set. Do you think it'll get here before the 20th anniversary? That would be awesome if it did. I know. polyester did a video about the orders, but I'd have to check the site to see when the they're planning on shipping. Okay. All right. I'm excited about it. Well, in the meantime, let's move on to a completely different headline from dark Sakura. Yeah, so, uh, you know, and this is actually coming in light of all of this bullshit coming from faux news about, oh, we're gonna blame, you know, video game violence, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, same shit, different year, you know, but there is a study that's out. This is that children could have a boost to their intelligence by playing video games. So the study was on American children between nine and 10 years old who spent more time playing that when they spent more time playing video games, they experienced a significant increase in their intelligence stores. When retested two years later, amounting to an extra 2.5 IQ points above the average. They said that basically, other forms of screen time were also tested such as watching videos, chatting on social media, and they had neither a positive nor negative effect on intelligence. For the record, the the study had zero funding from anyone in the video game industry. They said that they they did not examine the effects of screen behavior on physical activities, sleep, mental well being or school performance. But when just testing intelligence, that was the result. And it was across the board. Um, I'm going to actually read this this quote on here. And this is actually from Torkel Klingberg, who is a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Our result, our results support the claim that screen time generally doesn't impair children's cognitive abilities, and that playing video games actually helps boost intelligence. This is consistent with several experimental studies of video game playing. So the analysis was on more than 9000 boys and girls. And it was on a long term study. Like I said, there were there were two years that they were all retested. And when they were nine to 10, they went through different psychological tests to gauge their general, you know, mental capacity, what their level of intelligence was, you know, they were also asked how much time they spent watching TV playing video games and on social media. On average, they spent about two and a half hours a day watching TV, a half hour on social media and one hour playing video games. Two years later, 5000 of the children repeated the psychological tests, and that they showed that kids who played more than the average hour of video games wound up with higher intelligence scores than the kids who spent less time playing video games. And what they're thinking is that it provides what what they're referring to as enriched environments, and requires them to tackle tasks that they would not do every day. For example, active strategy, planning, quick executive decision making. The more that someone plays the games, they build the neural pathways that establish the their adaptation to those particular skills. And we know that that's actually how the mind learns a skill is that it forms a neural pathway that outlines this is how you do it. I mean, it's where we get muscle memory from, for example, is because that's formed that that connection with with the body to just know how to do it. And another quote on here, who is an associate professor of psychiatry, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles. That's Dr. Anish Dubey, I think is how it's pronounced. But he says that the more someone practices or plays these video games, the more they reinforce the neural pathways involved in accomplishing the objectives of the game. And those same neural pathways may be involved in other types of real world decision making that factor into our measure of intelligence. Video games by design, require focus and attention to the content presented and strategizing in the moment. Whereas it's easy to watch something on television without paying much attention to the content. If you watch a segment on television and miss something you do not lose, and you can still infer the missing parts based on the remaining narrative. This would be harder to do in video games. So now they're also talking about now of doing other studies where they're want to find correlation between video game and mental health after two years. And if it all if an improvement in intelligence also correlates to better mental health. I have learned that the smarter I get, more depressed I get, because I understand that things are shitty. That that's just an aside. But I mean, look at look at a lot of us, you know, how many of us basically had a controller in our hand when we were, you know, little Yeah, I was gonna I was gonna say like, we all grew up with video games. And I think we've heard for many years, you know, video games are going to rot your brain. Yet most of us that grew up on these games, we all turned out pretty intelligent, you know, like, you know, and I don't know to what extent the games are to thank for that. But they definitely didn't rot our brains like we were told they were going to. I would think it also depends on the genre of game that someone typically plays. But definitely puzzle games, especially the ones that are timed, and things like Pio Pio, or even Tetris, you're learning your spatial awareness, along with quick decision making. And then you have things that are like, like people who play the strategy games, that's teaching to look beyond an immediate circle and look for long term effect. You know, at least that's what where I'm going with this part of it. Those are just inferences that I've made. I think many of us that grew up on video games played a variety of games, you know, sure, we had our favorites, I'm sure, but we played a probably a variety of games. I think it goes back to you were talking about that, you know, the tasks are something that these kids are doing, and that their brain is kind of constantly moving, because the games are giving them these different tasks. And probably, again, depending on the type of game you're playing, it's in cases, yeah, is what sort of tasks it is. Whereas I would bet the control group that didn't play the games, probably was watching television, and just absorbing whatever was being put at them. And there was no task to complete, you're just absorbing someone else's story. Now, if you want to argue difference between ambient and active, well, now, if you want to argue that maybe kids were going out and playing sports instead, or something like that, then that's all fine and good. And that's probably really good for someone's physical health. But you know, a good a good coordination, sure, reflex time, but it's there's not a variety of tasks the way there are in games. And you know that between the strategy game and the the that would exercise your brain, you're certainly getting the physical activity, but not the I think, while there is a cognitive element that's involved in playing a game, usually it's not the player that's having to make the plan. It's the coach or whoever who's looking over the thing, making the plan, and sending out the players to do that. Now the player has to execute whatever task that they're doing. And yes, there's going to be, you know, like, I'll just use like, baseball, there's aiming, there's spatial awareness, there's force, there's knowing how to a little bit of physics involved in it, in it with hitting directions and whatnot. But in the end, they have a particular task that they're executing, and they're limited within that task that they're executing. Same with football, if you're given a play, you know that your job is to cover this person's ass while they run with a ball, or your job is to take said ball and run like hell and make sure that no one pounds your head into the dirt. I would think even with an individualized sport like tennis, it's still, you know, you still have a tennis coach, but who's teaching you how to play it, but you're kind of going through the same motion, right? You're going through the same motions, pretty much. And again, Your end goal is the same every single time that you do it. And I'm not knocking physical sports for kids. That's fine. As long as you know, it's a positive environment and everything, because we've all seen some scary shit at Little League games. But as long as it's a positive and supportive environment, I'm all for it. Because you know, I think a good mix is probably the best, but I'm just kind of illustrating. It doesn't have the same level of cognitive stimulation. The mental. Yeah, so it's just interesting. So I'm glad science is out there to prove. I'm sure that won't matter to a lot of people, but it's nice to still have some of the science and studies behind it for sure. It absolutely is. I'm going to send it to my mom and tell her this is why I'm smart. There. There you go. And I think that's what most people will be doing with this article this week. Those of us like us who grew up on games and Hey, Mom, look, we're told they were gonna rot our brain, or that I told violent video games, we're gonna, you know, unwind us or whatever it was. So now I'm, I think that one other thing that that I would like to see, and it's too late to do it now. Because I mean, of course, those times are long past. But I would be interested to see how earlier types of gaming, like, you know, growing up a pinball. I, I don't think that and now keep in mind, I love pinball. I love to play pinball. I think that you still have some of that still same limited strategy that you wouldn't have in say, going through a game where you're solving multiple puzzles and working through a narrative. Yeah. And I hate to say it, because I mean, there's there's some new pinball tables out there that have a lot of good challenges and everything. But in the end, it's flipper plus ball, you know, meets target. All right. Well, let's move on to a game that has a lot of people thinking right, Loki. Yeah. So, you know, I think we've always been wondering if there's gonna be a sequel for Death Stranding coming. And I kind of figured that if there was going to be a sequel coming for that, then I mean, we're gonna find out about it with some sort of event starring Jeff Keighley. You know, I mean, we have one right around the corner. So it only makes sense if there was going to be an announcement that that might be coming. But apparently, it's been sort of acknowledged by Norman Reedus. Basically saying that, um, yeah, I don't know if he's, you know, he's necessarily confirmed it, but there's a lot of like, weird, like, tweets and stuff going around, like, Hideo Kojima has got playing looks like action figures and stuff like that. And then of course, you know, he said, you know, quick, okay, so you've got a book going on, you've got final season coming out, and then a spin off, and you're filming Death Stranding, the video game. I'm saying, you know, we just started the second one. And this was, I believe, in an interview that he was talking about for the upcoming book, The Ravaged. So he was talking about like the stuff that he's working on right now. So so he slipped. I mean, a lot of a lot of these pre work has to be done in advance. He slipped. They're not going to sue Norman Reedus over a broken NDA. They're not going to do it like he probably didn't mean to spoil it. But he probably Norman Reedus probably doesn't follow the industry because he's he's an actor trying to do movies and that type of stuff. He probably doesn't follow the industry close enough to know there's a very specific timetable when you announce things that it does. So he slipped up, you made a mistake, whatever, like, it's just it. And nothing will happen to him as a result. And you know, ultimately, now it's just okay, well, that secrets out. But I would I love the response. So once this news kind of came out, Hideo Kojima posts, go to your private room, my friend. He has like a bat, a picture of the bat with barbed wire. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So Kojima basically confirming it. But what's weird about I'm not shocked that there's a sequel to Death Stranding. I'm not shocked about that. But a lot of talk with Kojima lately has been what is he working on now? Isn't he working on a scary game? Isn't there something kind of new that he's doing? And you know, the IP silent hell that won't go away. It would be weird if like all this time, it just turns out, oh, he's working on a Death Stranding sequel. I'm not saying that's bad, because Death Stranding was an interesting game. And it came out at a really good time for that sort of story. But it just it's just it would just be a weird conclusion to all this Kojima mystery of the last few years. It would be a little unusual. But also, you mean, what do we do nowadays in the game industry? We we make sequels. True. So well, and that's not to say Kojima can't work on two things at once. And especially when we're talking about designing for what is now current gen systems. I'm sure they have to get all the motion capture of Norman Reedus locked in way sooner rather than later to get him rendered. And in the game, you know, if he's the primary character, again, they got to get all that work done. I mean, this game could still be years out. And he's involved now. Absolutely. There's no reason why that can't be the case. So it's not to say Kojima can't work on two games at once. It's just, I don't think this was the one they plan to announce at Keeley's next event. So probably not. Yeah. Let's see Questbuster in chat says on the other hand, Reedus might be playing Kojima's long PR game like a damn fiddle. Maybe suggesting that there was a little bit of malice, maybe playful malice. I don't think yeah, Reedus is in the interest of actually hurting Kojima. He's still not dressing up in full was it full body cast makeup again. But you know, I could see that maybe he trolls Kojima by announcing it early because like, what's gonna happen? What are you gonna do? So what people know about the game early? So what when you get do stab me? Yeah, big game get sequel. Tell me something I don't know. But I think for a lot of us that you know, follow the releases about. It's just I think I guess I can really only speak for myself. I'm surprised that Death Stranding sequel would be next potentially. I just thought there was something else happening. But there's it's it's also very possible something else got canceled. It's happened before. So who knows? All right, moving on. Let's talk about what I think is very interesting with this whole PlayStation. You know, the PlayStation Plus is getting redone. And we actually know what some of the PlayStation Plus releases are going to be we know what some of the classics are that when the service rolls out in on June 13. For the Americas. I think it's even sooner for Japan. I think Japan gets it this weekend. So we know some of the classics. So we know that for example, PlayStation one and PlayStation portable. These are the classics you will get if you subscribe to that highest tier. ape escape, hotshots golf, IQ intelligent cube, jumping flash, siphon filter, super stardust portable, Mr. driller tech and two worms world party worms are Armageddon. And that's it 10 games. Now, I'm not saying that list is bad by any means. But I know when I heard this news, I was like, wait a damn minute. Didn't they say in their press release, they were going to have up to 350 classic games that were playable. Now, sure, I see that there are PlayStation two games and PlayStation three games. Sure, you add it all up, it's maybe 50. It's not 350. So I guess maybe it's a long game. And many people on Twitter when I made a sassy tweet about this many people on Twitter were quick to correct me and say, this is a first look list. This is a preliminary list. This is not the finalized list. Okay, counterpoint. This is out next week in Japan. The time for first look is past. This is now the time for a deep look, an intimate look a further look, because this is what they're trying to get people to buy. And if it's 10 games, that's not my first now here's where I'm going to start to kind of scale back my reaction. Because when I heard this list on Monday, I was like, that is sad. That's sadder than what Nintendo launched their switch online with and you see how much shit they get for that, right? That is the 10 for the PS one. That's sad. But then a second part of this came out where I'm like, Oh, this is why it's only 10. And that is that the PS classic games are going to now have trophies. Remember, they didn't have trophies near the PlayStation one. But a tweet where Ben studio shared a clip of siphon filter showed a new trophy and explosive start available in the PlayStation one classic. And Ben studio actually, the design manager there, Eric Jensen said in a tweet responding to a fan, he helped out with a few of the trophies, mostly naming. And there's apparently a platinum trophy called excellent work agent, which assumably would be what you get when you unlock all of the other trophies. Ah, so this explains now it's just trophies. And you know, some people may feel stronger about trophies than others. But now I understand why it's taken so long for them to because now they're actually having they're not just slapping an emulator on it and putting it out on the service Nintendo. But they're actually going back and trying to add more flags for trophies and maybe other stuff too. We'll see when it comes out. Maybe some types of filtering. I don't know. But I'm not really counting on any of that. I still think it was wrong of them to promote 350 games. Even if that is their plan to get there in three years. That's not where they're at this week when it launches in Japan. So I don't know. We'll see. I don't know when you hear about all this. The 10 games and all this stuff. I'm looking at chat now. Finally, Bobby Blackwell says up to 350 games. Yeah. Okay. I think we all know the use of up to was a little little bit of a stretch here. Just a tad. Just a tad. Um, Mike Deaf says trophies for PlayStation One games is pretty cool. Yeah, it is pretty cool. Let's see. And Mike Deaf says we're also not paying around $80 a year for the PlayStation Plus service. And not to mention that even Nintendo was criticized for having so little games in the service. I thought you were paying $80 for the highest level PlayStation Plus. Isn't it something like 120 a year or something like that? So I don't know. Anyway, I could be wrong. I don't have all that. The PlayStation Plus, unfortunately, it's a little complicated. And I don't have the chart in front of me right now that shows how much every level costs. But I'm not I'm not sure these 10 games are worth it to me to get the highest level of PlayStation Plus. I was already a little bit like a but now after seeing this list, I'm like, Nah, I don't want it. I don't need it. It's just our stupid PlayStation Now stuff. I just don't I'm not interested in that stuff. Yeah. Dark Sakura trophies. Do they matter? Is it incentive? Or nah? No. No. And I think that just depends on the gamer. Some people love the trophy chase the trophy hunt. I would love to see something like trophies in the Nintendo collection. Not that I would necessarily want to chase them all. But I think it would be fun to have like your little digital certificate, your digital badge, your little proof that yes, I beat Metroid without using codes or whatever. Kid Icarus will be even bigger one. I beat Kid Icarus without using codes or whatever it is. I think that would be fun. But I also don't count on Nintendo to get by that there was another Reggie interview that came out where somebody asked him why did Nintendo take so damn long to come to the table with online? And it's the answer most of us had assumed for many years. Japan didn't understand that that that it was more of a need in the US and Europe is basically extremely paraphrasing what Reggie said. You can go look at that up for yourself if you want. But yeah, just on a related note, continue to drag their feet on that, I guess. Mike Deft says, Yeah, I think it's over 100. But it's different in Mexico and Latin America or Mike Deft is that than it is for the US because they don't have PlayStation now there. And that is true is that, you know, a lot of countries, notably Australia, aren't going to have the same type of PlayStation Plus because they can't do the cloud streaming. For whatever reason, it's just not built to support that the infrastructure of Sony in those countries or whatever. Interesting. All right. Meanwhile, there's a very interesting headline that's getting a lot of attention Dark Sakura. Well, um, we actually brought this up kind of last week, I think talking about Xbox and how they're selling in Japan. And it turns out that for the first time in eight years, the Xbox has outsold PlayStation in Japan this past week. The Xbox Series S alone outsold the PS5 and PS5 digital edition by about 3, 3,800 units. So however, I mean, it's it's a rare occurrence. And I think that some of this has to do with system availability and whatnot. So one other thing also to keep in mind, too, is that it hadn't had the best support by Microsoft in in Japan before, but now they're having a lot more successful series of sales with this particular system. Simply because of the rollout of Game Pass for both console and PC in Japan in April 2020. So they've seen a lot more player activity than any other time in Xbox history in Japan. And that they're also thinking that the acquisition of Tango Gameworks is going to be a very big step toward achieving a better market share in Japan. Phil Spencer is actually saying that they intend to take better care of Japanese players and and really make sure that they have, you know, they have a place in that aspect of the gaming industry that their their needs are being catered to that games are coming out that they'd want to play. I think it's I think it's good. I mean, yeah, it could be due to availability, but it is what it is. It's actually worth mentioning. Yeah, no, for sure. You know, and last week there. Yeah, right. This topic came up last week. There was no fact behind it to back it up until what we have here tonight. But we had a caller on the show last week who said, you know, I was saying the Xbox is a non factor in Japan. And that's just the way it is. And somebody said, No, it's wrong. It's selling. Yeah, I was wrong. I commit that I whoops. And this this headline sure, sure made a humble person out of me. It is what it is. Now, I, again, I think this just makes a nice headline because, yes, and I agree with Zen monkey 11. And Chad is saying, that's because people can't find PlayStation fives. It's not like they sold, I think a better, a more impactful headline, I guess would have been if the Xbox sold a lot of units, you know, out of but they didn't, they still didn't sell all things considered that many units, but I didn't think they were hardly selling any. And apparently, Microsoft is starting to catch on in Japan a little more again. And now you kind of brought up game pass. I know undertale recently got localized to Japanese audiences, I think. So I think there's just a lot of stuff now that probably game passes leveraging. And I think that it's interesting that it's the Xbox s, and not the x. So it's, it's probably that lower price for the s, combined with the fact that it's a game pass system. And it's it's turning some heads in Japan. I still don't think it's, you know, I think we put the lifetime sales next to Sony and Nintendo, it's still not where you know, a competitive system ought to be. But this headline certainly shows that there's potential there for Microsoft to grow. And maybe all is not lost, I would say with Microsoft in Japan, as I had assumed last week. So props to Phil Spencer on that victory and that headline, even if maybe a chip shortage was to thank for it. In part still, I think the fact that they sold as many as they did is still a long way from where they were even what 510 years ago. All right. Well, moving on, Loki. Yep. So speaking about Xbox, there's this cool new patent that is coming out, talking about how I don't know if this necessarily goes back to when they announced the Xbox one and that type of stuff. But remember, that was supposed to be almost like a digital only console at one time, but now they have a way that they're saying they're going to be able to validate your physical media to unlock digital copies of the game. So if I have like a physical version of, you know, Grand Theft Auto four, something like that, then somehow, it'll be able to scan that disk and authenticate a digital copy of the game for me since you know, they may in the future not be able to play those games on the drives that they have, like the Blu-ray drives might not be able to handle it or something like that. So I'm not necessarily sure how it's going to work. But sounds interesting. I can tell you it's gonna work. Jason outlined it a little bit in the intro. Well, we don't know for sure. But I'm, I would guess absolutely, they're going to leverage Windows 11. They're going to leverage Windows 11. And what they're going to do is they're going to build something into that that will decrypt the Xbox disks the same way the system does. And it'll know Yep, this is a valid copy of this disk. And while you're signed into this account here on your PC, and the disk is in the drive, we know you have the game and now it's available on your Xbox in your account. That's, that's, I would bet that's what they're going to do is they're going to leverage, you know, the market share of Windows 11 to make that happen. Hope it's not I hope I don't need a disk drive in my computer to be able to true because we're starting to see less and less of those are as most nobody has, you know, optical drives anymore. I still have one. You would be surprised. Trust me. I hear about it all the time. There's trust me, there's annoying still a lot of people that kind of rely on it for I have these old photo CDs, or I have drivers that you know, what if I don't have internet and I need something, you know, like, the drive now is just for backup purposes, even though Yeah, I guess a USB drive can also be, you know, a big thing. But you can also get a drive, you can get a DVD drive, that is USB, or Blu ray drive that is USB if you really wanted it. So but without outing where I work, I get plenty of I need to burn this Blu ray disc, I need to burn this DVD, and it needs to be a video disc. And there are a lot of people who are still using it as an active media trade source. A lot of folks in chat are kind of lighting up about like Bobby Blackwell says you can't get a gaming PC case with a drive bay anymore. DJRMS says I want to buy a new PC case, but so many new and fancy ones do not have spots for optical drives. Well, I guess I'm giving away how old my computer is. I am looking to replace it. It's a few years old at this point. But yeah, and not that an optical drive is something I'm looking for. But this is a very interesting patent that might change that conversation a little bit where I'm like, Oh, maybe I want an external USB drive. I mean, we'll see. And then someone else in chat, I think as Joe and under Matt said, not gonna lie, I wish Sony had this patent. It's not to say Sony couldn't do it. They'd have to pay Microsoft to do it at this point, but they could do it. And you might kind of laugh at that prospect. But how does Microsoft have the Blu ray player? Because guess who has a stake in Blu ray right now. So Microsoft has to pay Sony to have a Blu ray player on their device. There could be an interesting exchange there. Hmm. But bear in mind, though, a patent does not reflect reality. That is true, too. There's patents for things all the time that never end up happening. And yeah, lots of that stuff, or they change significantly and so forth. Absolutely. But it is I'll give you an example. Sega VR. Mm hmm. They had working units never came out. Well, partly because they were causing migraines because the sync between player movement and backgrounds would disconnect and gave people seizures. But that's another story. Pod culture and chat says yeah, Microsoft back to the wrong format in that war. I they didn't have a choice. You know, again, Sony had a stake in Blu ray. So they weren't going to especially you know, when it was about being that definitive living room device, they were not going to use their pay their competitor to they were going to leverage HD DVD. The mistake Microsoft made was not having HDVD players in every single Xbox that was that it was a separate accessory. That was the problem because that's how PlayStation made DVDs as impactful as they were is that they were on every PlayStation two they sold was also a DVD player. And you got to think way back that's how DVDs became the thing was the PS two. And then how to Blu rays win that war PlayStation three. So it's Yep, I think my I just say, you know, yeah, yeah, Microsoft did back the wrong format. I would just say they didn't have a choice. I think it's just the poorly timed implementation that didn't work. And you know, and by the time it was about the Xbox one, while it was done, the victor had been decided porn went to Blu ray and it was over. So interesting, Bobby Blackwell says one of the reasons they backed HD DVD was because they wanted both to lose. So streaming and digital would win. Ah, that's also clever to split the market. Perhaps. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about a game I've played a little bit here in a little bit thereof. It's Pokemon go and Pokemon go who boy. You know, I feel like every other month on the show, we're talking about Niantic made a change and their player base doesn't like it. Well, guess what? They did it again. They made another change and the player base doesn't like it. And it has to do with scaling back the remote raid passes. So they were giving away remote raid Pat. Well, they weren't giving them away. But it was they were giving away because they were doing these one pokey coin bundles every week was giving you a remote raid pass. I don't know when they started that. But it wasn't more than a year ago. This wasn't something they started at the beginning of the pandemic. But they started doing it about a year ago, I would say is when they started giving away those remote raid passes. And they said they were going to do it every week in the in the bundles. Well, they're going to stop. They're not going to give you remote raid passes for free and bundles and or you know what I mean for one coin, which is practically free. So that's gone. And as they did that, they have upped the cost of the remote raid passes in a bundle anyway, most people were by a one remote raid pass will cost you 100 coins. Three used to cost you 250. But you got that discount, right? Guess what three now cost you 300. So there is no point to buying those raid passes in bulk. And that was a change. They just made it. It's already live in the game. It's a done deal. And yes, you can earn coins for free in the game. If you do the gym meta, but you can only earn 50 coins a day. So you don't you can't remote raid every day. You can only remote raid twice a week, basically. So or, you know, once every other day, I don't know anyway, what they're also trying to do. And basically, why is it that they're doing this? Because America has decided COVID is over and they're just following suit. Notice how I phrase I didn't say COVID is over I said America decided COVID is over. There's a big difference. Niantic is also trying to push people to raid in person again, by getting the rewards for in person rating to be sweeter. So you get more not just rare candy when you do those raids, but you get rare XL candies, which are very hard to come by. I don't think anybody's upset with that change. Plus, you know, it Pokemon go rating, either everybody's sitting in their own car and doing it that way. Or at least it's outdoors. And you don't have to really be close to people to do it. You know, I've done plenty of my remote or excuse me, plenty of my own Pokemon raid in the day. And I would see even in the era of COVID. It's a pretty safe thing to do compared to most things. However, I just think what kind of sucks here. And I think what a lot of you know, the players don't like is that it's not that they're just adding something. It's that they're also taking something away with no warning. I think if they have just added the incentives to get out there and do it in person, then they would motivate more people to go out there and do it in person, especially the XL candy, but to take away with these remote raids. And I think it's just a matter of time before they flip that switch if they didn't already. But remote raids are supposed to be weaker. You're not supposed to be able to do as much damage in remote raids. So even though today you might be able to take out what a tapu fini I think is the latest legendary that's in the game. You can take that out with four people in a remote raid. You're not supposed to be able to do that. It's supposed to be weaker. And I imagine it's just a matter of time before they flip that switch too. So yeah, and Mike Defton chat says yeah, Niantic lack of communication toward the player base is what hurts the game more than anything. And this is the part where we sit here going. They just supposedly learn their lesson. Like not even three months ago, when we had this whole discussion about changing the radius of the pokey stop, and they they tried to shrink it back to 40, which would match what Pikmin and Ingress have. But again, because you're taking something away that you put in there and you I think they had kind of said would always be there. The player base lost their fucking mind and held their feet to the fire over it. And they had to reverse course and say, we'll listen in the future. We'll listen. Well, this just shows they're not listening. And that's what's incredibly frustrating for some people. Now, I don't know how many people are going to go to the great lengths that are necessary to really make your point and delete the fucking game. If it's that. And I will say our own Pokemon nerd resident nerd Shane who's come on the show several times. He's told me he's deleted the game from his phone and he's done with it. Like between this, the reduced incense spawns living in a rural area. He's just like, Pokemon go just isn't for me. And he deleted it off his phone. So I mean, it'll take a lot of people to do that. I think for Niantic to really shape shift their shift course and do that whole thing. So but in the meantime, let's see what are some other comments here? Oh, there are new social features that are supposed to be coming to the game in the next few months. Oh, yeah. I got an invite to a Niantic social app. So it's interesting because the whole social stuff is already built into ingress. But I guess because I'm an ingress player, maybe they even know I'm a heavy user. I don't know. I got invited through because you know, it's not it's not quote unquote, easy to beta stuff on an apple compared to Android because on Android, they just kind of put it up as a beta but an apple you have to be invited by the publisher to something called test flight in order to be able to attest and that's what I got through Niantic is a test flight version of the Niantic social app. Now, they didn't make me sign anything. So I tweeted about it. I was like, here's what it looks like. But and then they added a splash screen to the game that says reminder, this is confidential. And you're not just put anything out there on apps. And I'm like, Okay, look, if you want to know what the Niantic social is, download ingress because it is completely in the ingress game already, completely in the game already. So it's I don't know what they're keeping so secret about this app. I also don't know why they're building a separate app for it, and not just putting it into Pokemon go. But somebody I was talking to had a really good take on why is that maybe the Pokemon company won't allow it. That you know, there's only because you know, the Pokemon company kind of has to own a lot of the stuff that goes the Pokemon go. And maybe they're not allowing Niantic to put their social app in there. So they have to kind of do their own thing. I'm going to try to I'm trying to show you without like giving away where I live. Okay, I zoomed way in so you can't really let me turn the map a little bit. Okay, I zoomed way in here. So all you have to I'll show you the bottom half the screen, all you have to do if you hit the little button in ingress, and you go to the social, which is right in the middle. And keep in mind, I'm not breaking any rules. I'm not showing their app or anything I'm showing. There is oops, I got to make sure I'm not zoomed in too far on the dot. I don't care if it shows the neighborhood that I don't want it to show exact house. There's the Niantic social app. It's built in ingress. So if you want to know what's coming, just download ingress. It's right there in the game. So um, and why is Niantic doing that? Probably because they're seeing how much of their community is going to discord and slack and telegram and group me and all of those apps. And they're like, Hey, we want to have a little piece of that. So there it is. Mike Defton chat says this is actually really good for stuff like that. The group I was in for ingress used to use Google Hangouts back in the day. Yeah, back in the day until they retired that but yeah, oh yeah, I used to love Google Hangouts for that stuff. Mike Defton chat says the social app looks like a discord server and it looks so bad pretty much it looks like just a pretty cheap knockoff of discord. So I don't I don't know like what special thing is going to really draw people to the app, but we'll see. So anyway, Mike Defton says they use Facebook Messenger where they're at. Interesting. All right, anyway. That's what they're doing in Pokemon Go. Will they reverse the remote raid price change? Probably not if people don't stop buying them. So if you if you are pissed off about these changes, you have to stop buying remote raid passes. That's the only way this is going to change. Tapu Fini can even be shiny anyway. I don't know why people will people aren't rating him. I've gotten to raid him once with a remote raid pass. And this this is the part that pisses me off. Then he ran away. That's the part that I like I connected with every single ball and the fucker still ran away. That's what that's the enraging part. I don't you know if it's 100 coins to do it, whatever. But I literally got nothing for doing it. Except some stardust and thanks for playing. Silly and frustration. Don't forget that part. Yes, I got frustration. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Speaking of frustration, let's talk about some old school video games because I you know what a lot of those were really frustrating. Now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week. And this is a very unique kind of pick for tonight, isn't it? It is. So and I do hope that you skip around a little bit in the video. Sure. I meant to do an edited version. That's okay. I'll skip that a little bit. But I picked a Bobo's Big Adventure, which was a freeware parody flash game. It came out January 11th, 2012 to play on any browser that would support flash. So the whole the basically the point is, is that you are a Bobo and you're trying to rescue your son. What was his name? Like a boy boy, I think was his name. That's cute. Yeah. But at any rate, you have to go through like different video games with like different characters mixed around. And so each of the sub games have different names. You have Double Drabobo, Super Mabobo, Urban Chabobo, Zelda Bobo, Balloona Bobo, Pro Rabobo, Mega Mabobo, and Contra Bobo and Puncha Bobo. So you have to use your directional keys to do your movement, you know, A and S are different actions. So like, like for example, the first one you're going through, and you know, beating people up, there's a Goomba that shows up, you know. All of the levels are a single level except for Contra Bobo. I mean, because Contra is like that. But yeah, you have to rescue a Bobo. That's his name, a Bobo, who gets, you know, beaten up in like the beginning of Double Dragon. And then you go through the different places until you end with Puncha Bobo where you run into Doc from Punch Out. And big spoiler, Little Mac is the bad guy. And then you have to decapitate him with a Power Glove. But it was all a dream. So it references so many different games in there. It's pretty funny. But the game actually started development in 2002 by the founder of iMakari, Roger Barr, who wanted to make it his first full length Flash game, and you know, show his favorite NES character a Bobo. He worked with a programmer named Bain and they did some early levels. It was delayed though for a while, especially when a game that was very similar called Domo-kun's Angry Smash Fest came out. But with the help of Nick Pasto of Pestoforce and Pox of the Pox Box, they started over in 2006 and just went going and tried to keep it along with, you know, standard NES programming styles. And so they they mixed up the characters and they did all kinds of different stuff. And then they had the Flash version working and they revealed the first three levels in 2009 at San Diego Comic Con with a NES controller, the way it was intended. They had a cabinet, everything there. And then in 2010, they had a free to play cabinet with a sort with a NES homage joystick area with artwork done by Jeff Bandelin of Newgrounds. And then it got delayed again in 2011. And then finally, a bar took the game with him on a comedy tour that he was invited to go with. And then the trailer came out. And then after a bunch of and basically the trailer was a response to donations that they got. And then they started working on a smaller game called a Bobo Small Adventure for anyone who donated. And then on January 11, 2012, it was released on Newgrounds. And it had a tutorial how to play it with a with a NES controller. There's a downloadable version of the game. And they want to actually keep having the cabinet out there. The game was pretty well received. It went Newgrounds 2012 game of the year game spy gave them some kudos. They called it the mother of all 8-bitch 8-bitch 8-bit. I try to say homage. The mother of all 8-bit homage flash video games. GameZone called it part parody and part tribute. They said that it's the story isn't cheesy, but is all kinds of badass. That is a quote. Wired said it was an 8-bit parody done right. So all along the board and the thing the biggest compliment is that Kishimoto Yoshihisa, who is the creator of Double Dragon, said in a Polygon interview that he was supportive and loved the game. You know, it's even been given some of its parody even was said to have blurred the line and go into the Dadaist expression. I thought that was pretty funny. It is it does have some surreal moments like like the whole part for me is the underwater level where a Bobo is having to, you know, swim through the Mario level and then there's like Bubble Man showing up and all kinds of interesting enemies. It's just really trippy and out there. I was reminded of Frog Fractions with how like not only referential this game is to, you know, other video games, but like how it's how it's really hodgepodge II, you know what I mean? Like we just that's the point of it. Yeah, we just saw that scene you were talking about here on the video. The whole like, underwater level from Mario meets a Mega Man boss meets the goonies meets like this is the balloon fight one. Yeah, it's just like everything going on at once. Let me see. I'm gonna fast forward to one more scene here. Oh, this looks like pro wrestling where he's actually killing the wrestlers. So that's that's something. Yeah. I also really like the Mega Man one because he just looks like his face has been photoshopped onto Mega Man's body, which is a bit further up. I think that's like the third to last one. And then there's the contra one and then punch the punch out when there's before punch out there's what is this is like Kirby. That's the contra one. But Oh, no, I can't show this act deaf. This is you trying to kill Kirby with a machine gun. That's bad. I'm pretty, pretty adorable. It is pretty adorable. Like if Kirby is going to be a villain, this is the way to do it. That's awesome. I agree with Bobby a drag race nest game called Super eight bitch. Why are you our only hope? All right. Is that it? I think that's it. There it is. Your class. It's Yeah, it's pretty funny. Apparently, it's still available at sites.google.com Um, and I wonder if this is Oh, yeah, I won't it won't play. You have to have like some browser let you do flash. But I think that someone out there if I remember right, I think someone out there did sort of messify it. But I'll see if I can find like the website. And yeah, I click on the website and it's just all Nope. So once on the internet being emulated by ruffle. So it has to load but you can still play it. I'll link it in the chat. All right. There it is your classic game of the week of Bobo's big adventure. A parody game of sorts. That, you know, this is kind of that's kind of fun to have, like, I guess, which would really be a homebrew game as the classic game of the week, but any game is eligible, right? So why not? And I and released games. Yeah. So I think I did space fantasy zone once you did you did the the one that was the polybius. That one. You did oblivious. Yeah, that one wants to so. Yeah, why not? So there it is classic game of the week. And that's actually the classic that never happened. That's one that I would love to go back and revisit because it is so funny. And it's like I knew I knew of it back in the day, but I never I didn't spend a lot of time with it. I didn't realize just how many layers of references deep it went. But that's pretty good. That really that does seem like a Loki game. Many people are in chatter saying don't ask why why are Loki's the NES developer remember? And I'm like, this is a Loki type of game. But I don't know if Loki wants to make you gonna make us a super eight bitch. Oh, no. He's got he's a Minecraft content maker. I'm starting to work on visual novels. But I'm actually using a visual novel tool to do my my DBD machinima. I'm here. All right, let's move on to rapid fire news. I have my hosting gigs on the side. That's my other thing. All right. Let's get a rapid fire. Nervous breakdown on the side. That's okay. Yeah, it's true. Is that too? Oh, am I my my weight loss? I'm a skinny. I have a side of skinny. All right, not really. But closer than it was. All right. Let's travel around and check out some other news going on in the industry. rapidly. That's why it's rapid fire news. I'm going to step away real quick because I need something to drink. So y'all keep rapid fire moving. I'll be back. So Epic Games is actually giving away Borderlands three for a limited time. It's available now until 826. I totally downloaded it last night. Yeah, 8am Pacific time. So uh, yeah, you can check it out. Um, it's a great game. Unfortunately, I already purchased it when it came out. So can't get it for free, but they're going to be doing some more giveaways here pretty soon outside of this. But yeah, it's it's pretty nice. And then of course, they're also having a sale going on right now as well. Along with that, there's news about the current generation version of the Witcher three, which is slated now to arrive at the end of 2022. And it's been delayed a bit. But you know, I know that they've been busy with fixing cyberpunk and stuff like that. But now they shared via Twitter that it is coming out q4 2022 on PlayStation five and Xbox series X and s. So we'll wait and see what that looks like. Well, then, um, have actually have you gotten anything though on the the sale that's going on? I have not because I haven't really been buying games because I will and that's not true. I have purchased games, but I don't play them. So no, I didn't pick up anything on the sale. Yeah, I haven't looked to see what they have because yeah, it's more stuff that just probably end up in my back log at some point. So at the finish for Lance three, I haven't even gone through all that. But for anyone on stadia right now, they're doing a sale on pac-man mega tunnel battle, and a few other goodies for it. And then they also have like a bunch of the Assassin's Creed games on sales, city legends hundred days, there's actually a few really good ones on there right now. And a bunch of stuff mark down like the city skylines, stadia edition, just quite a few things that's on sale right now, if you're another stadia player, I'm outriders outriders is one of them on pro right now, that not a lot of the games have a deep discount on epic games right now. The only thing that kind of jumps out at me right now that they have in their top sellers is probably Red Dead Redemption two, which is half off right now. Tiny T's wonderlands like 20% off but like, yeah, yeah, I want to check out tiny Tina's wonderlands. But I'm kind of with you, Loki. I don't want to add to my backlog right now. But you know, I grabbed Borderlands three. I didn't have that yet. So I was like, yoink. That's a great game. It's a little cringe as far as the story dialogue stuff goes, but the game itself is good. Yeah. Did you remember demos actually on stadia right now, including chorus? Did your MSN chat says ttw is so good. Yeah, I want to check it out for sure. Do well, I'm going into my news. I was trying to expand it to give you time to get some water. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'm back. So for anyone who's playing Kirby 64, the crystal shards through Nintendo Switch Online, there is a game breaking bug. Um, when you are hit by a certain damage sources in the water, you become stunned indefinitely. And the only way to get out of it is to quit the level. And so you can't finish really any of the underwater levels because if you get hit, then you just stay that way. Um, no one remembers this glitch being on the original console. So there has to be some interaction with the original programming and the emulation, I think. So there you go. Boy, I want to apologize to Mike Deft. He's having a rough night. His fave is getting I mean, we just had him murdered during the classic of the week. And then now it's getting shit on. He's it's breaking. He's definitely this is this night for Kirby. I apologize. A giant Kirby though, just destroying everybody though is pretty funny. I'm just gonna say. All right, we will not apologize for the cute imagery of a evil Kirby taking over the world. I mean death by Kirby. What a what a way to go right? Precisely. All right. That's it for rapid fire news. Pie culture kaiju Kirby. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Some things we'll be playing this week that don't have Kirby as a villain. Loki. I mean, anything's possible. I don't know. I don't. I don't keep up with a lot of these games that are coming up and maybe they do. So this week we've got hard space shipbreaker on PC. token Ranboo warriors on Nintendo Switch. Euro kill the culmination game on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation five. sniper elite five on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. And then we have the legend of Niota boundless trails on Nintendo Switch. And what else that cow the kangaroo on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. My little pony a maritime Bay adventure on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one. And to go along with Pacman's birthday Pacman museum plus on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one. That's it. Still a lot of releases. But then I just remembered this weekend is Memorial Day. And that's like the unofficial official kickoff of summer. So I guess this is always a big week for games. And the Yeah, when you kick off for summer, that means you stop releasing video games, because that's typically how that goes. Yeah. Well, you got to get the games out for the kids to pick up for summer break or whatever, although our is the school year getting expanded in a lot of places because of all the shutdowns? I don't know. I don't know. It depends like that. It's different for different districts. My son's off this week. So the other schools have taken upon themselves to add vacation weeks for every month. So some of those are going a little bit longer. All right, let's go to Japan and check out the releases there. It's actually pretty similar to what Loki already stated. So on the Nintendo Switch, we have radiant tale is out in Japan this week. That Yuru kill the culmination games is also out in Japan this week. The Legend of Niota boundless trails also out in Japan this week. I think I heard Loki mentioned all those games here. townsmen a kingdom rebuilt the complete addition. So I think that means DLC included with the base game. That is out from THQ Nordic in Japan this week on the switch and that Pac Man museum plus also gets a Japanese release this week on the PlayStation. Oops, I went to four and I meant to go to five. Sometimes five has some different stuff. PS foreign switch releases Japan are almost always identical with PlayStation five is sometimes has some different ones. That Yuru kill combination games is also on PlayStation five. They also have the persistence enhanced is out in Japan this week. And Oh, interesting. Japan gets their version of five nights at Freddy's security breach this week. It is noted this is an English version of the game. So it hasn't been completely localized, but it is getting officially released in Japan this week. So interesting. All right. And yeah, I agree with she Hulk and chat. Yes, please for Pac Man Museum. I'm looking forward to that as well. Dark Sakura. How about Europe? On the 24th we have eastward for switch. On the 26th we have for PlayStation and Xbox sniper elite five. And also how the house of the dead remake for switch. On the 27th we have cow the kangaroo on the big three, and My Little Pony maritime Bay adventure. And then also just on PlayStation we have mortal shell game of the year steelbook edition. Did you know the limited edition of that house of the dead rerelease is called the limit dead edition. And I find that so funny. I love it. Love to hear that worse the pun the better. We're getting to that age. All right. Let's move on. We have a few more stories for y'all. And then we'll take your calls and comments, emails, all that good stuff. And the listener roundtable. But first, we have a few more stories to get through. And we'll start with Loki. Like it's another week and we get to talk about Activision Blizzard and more trouble at their end. Of course, this time, it's not about you know, all the misogyny and stuff going on. No, we're going back, you know, has several months now back to the land of lawsuits because of gambling and minors. So we're gambling and minors in this course being with loot packs. So the target of this is of course Hearthstone, specifically saying that people pay real world currency to gamble on winning in game items. And they won't provide refunds even when the purchases are completed by a minor. And apparently they argue that children comprise a large segment of their audience. And saying that it's unlawful, deceptive and misleading tactics in Hearthstone. So I think the whole like, you know, enticing people to buy those packs or something like that, that, you know, it's, I don't know, a class action or something worthy. It's a stretch, I think, but like, I get it, you know, that they're saying it because it's targeted towards everybody, but I don't know. Like some other countries, they've been able to kind of get away with, you know, making that lawsuit type of thing happen. But I don't know if they necessarily like, I don't see odds posted on this stuff. No, I don't think they have them. And maybe this is going to pressure them into doing it. But, you know, your kids can't keep buying this stuff if you watch what your kids get. Especially like the screenshot that they show is like a pack that's $125. Like that's a lot of money, like your kids aren't going to necessarily be buying that. Now to bring it back to my kids, like they do get a lot of money and like Roblox sometimes, especially or Roblox or whatever. It's like 100, almost $100 during birthdays or stuff like that Christmas, and they'll blow it like instantly. So it's, yeah, if you see that if you give a child an unlimited balance, they will go through Yeah, yeah, I can see that. But like, you know, I don't know, like they're saying that there is one, one of the people that are part of the lawsuit said this child spent over $300 on the Hearthstone between 2019 and 2021. Actually, not that much, honestly, like, like, oh, they were made without his permission using his credit card and debit cards. Yeah. But at the same time, though, that that's your fault for not securing your financial stuff to that. That's the same as like, you know, having kids or teenagers stealing cash out of your purse or something like that. Like it's, if you don't secure your finance, financial stuff, like, yeah, that can happen. But that's not the game's fault. But at the same time, I'm not going to say that like, you know, they aren't trying to tap into that whole gambling FOMO type of mindset when it comes to selling these packs, because they want you to feel like you need to buy them. And so they're going to advertise them like that. All right. Well, there's I saw I even though I think there's kind of a part of me that's like, yeah, get Activision Blizzard, get them, get them, especially Bobby Kotick, get him, like, personally, he should be sued for this just because he's still the CEO of the company. But that's not the realist of the situation. I think in this particular situation, like you've just you've got to put some onus on the parents for how much their kids are spending. You know, when I ran up $100 prodigy bill from using chat rooms, I got I don't want to say beat up because it wasn't that I didn't have that but but but verbally, I got some verbal lashings over the whole thing and grounded fucking grounded like hell and not able to use any of prodigy anymore after that for a little while. So you know, you got it. You got to put some responsibility on, you know, laying down the law when your kids get out of control with that stuff. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I'm with Mike Deft. As much as we want to dunk on a BK right now. This ain't it. I and I agree. This ain't it. So. All right. Let's move on. I wonder if this will be it will sit dark Sakura. Well, I think it's, I don't know. So McDonald's is making a video game. I mean, we did have Burger King do it. But this one instead make kids is one more Burger King game so bad, like so bad. Let the story be read, Loki. Anyway, it's sort of an advertisement sort of game. It's called McDonald's crush the rush. And you play as an employee working with drive thru orders. I mean, wasn't there like what an over like a waitress game? I think it sounds like root beer tapper. No, it's, it's a cafe, like Cafe Crush or something like that or like cafe, diner, dash, diner, dash, something ish. I mean, basically, what you have to do is you go to your different stations and you make the different things and you get what you need. It almost looks like a Sims view from up top. But basically, it's just clicking the order of items and get your team to work as efficiently as possible. And they want to make it look like food service is fun and entertaining. But it is repetitive gameplay. The whole thing is just to try to get people to work for McDonald's. And I don't know who would want to do that. I honestly like if I can't imagine somebody plays angles. Yeah, okay. I like that. Well, it seems like wasted. So I mean, I think of America's Army, you know, that was also a recruitment tool for a game and apparently they were actually fun. Yeah, apparently did pretty well. But they're solid games. Fanara wants to point out to Overcooked, which was also on the tip of my tongue. That was it. That's another one of those like team prep games. Yeah, yeah. That's that's a different type of game. Yeah. But yeah, I'm with, we need the king as dead by daylight killer for sure. Well, definitely is scary enough. Oh my god. I mean, McDonald's has all of these great characters that they're not using for games like they, you know, I mean, forget the Burger King. How about the fucking grimace from McDonald's? That would be a scary I mean, that practically is clown in that hippo outfit, but still like the grimace would be a scary fucking dead by daylight killer or the Hamburglar. Or what's what's the other one? Then there's the the their their friend with the pigtails. Yeah, the birdie? I think her name is literally birdie birdie the early bird. Yeah. And then we got it. Then we got to really go back and get the moon. Whatever that was big. Was it Mac? It was Mac. Mac tonight. No, what I want is the Hamburglar to be the killer. And then the fry guys to be like out in the map like with Nemesis and the zombies. Which by the way, I have officially stolen a couple of zombie names from other streamers. So we name our zombies. I would really go for like a dead by daylight game that's just with fast food mascots. Like let's let's do it. The five night Freddy's five nights at Freddy's rumor for DBD will never dies. Now it's been rumored for the last like seven DLC is and they still say oh, it's coming. It's coming. Five nights at Freddy's coming. Keep in mind too is that and they even said so in a very recent interview that when they're working on DLC, they're working on anywhere between like four to 10 extras a year to come out and in in in following years. Like the apparently the Candyman one is still floating around and has a lot of credence with it. Um, listen, boy chat room really loves this McDonald's cross step by daylight, I guess with Burger King thrown in there as well. You know, Chad is really eating this up. So there there's I guess I'll show 100 Matt's comment. The Burger King Kids Club grows up to be a cult like the purge. Oh, now me just added Wendy's to the mix because why not? Oh, you know, Wendy would just dominate. She'd be like the nurse. Difficult to master but once you do, everyone's your bitch. There was a comment I was gonna read up here. Oh, yeah. Oh, teacher teacher on SS Do you get paid a living wage for playing this game? Oh, that was a true that was the truth that was killed by truth. Um, for Nara said, Do they have DLC for this McDonald's game for the McFood game that has the drunk or stone customers and Karen DLC to real to real. That's awesome. That's like her other comment. Wendy's social media manager is a part. I was gonna say this the stone customers, they're at Jack in the Box because number one, everybody in America knows the McFlurry machine. And that's what you want is always broken after a certain hour. But hex session one sauce. But Jack in the Box specifically caters to stoners like they advertised it as what do you think those late night munchy boxes are like legitimately they sell something at Jack in the Box. I know Jack in the Box isn't a nationwide chain. I think they're they're good. I Jack in the Box would have an add on called three day old grease. But but Jack in the Box specifically has like a late night thing that's like a few jalapeno poppers, some popcorn chicken, an egg roll, some curly fries, like it's like a literally a little bit of everything. But it's only available after 11 o'clock. And we know exactly why. Do you know you know how we have barbecue and chili? Hmm. Yeah, I think for Wendy's, it would be a chicken nuggets and Frosty's. Yeah, chicken nuggets and Frosty's. All right. Yeah. All right, we got to move on. Let's move on to another story. Loki, I think this is yours. Yeah, so Nintendo is ramping up their fight against cheaters because they have their new eSports game right around the corner with Splatoon three. So they are pants are patenting a new anti cheat program. Okay, apparently they're saying they'd use something called code reuse techniques to auto generate attestation programs to detect whether a game has been modified. I don't know what that means. But they're going to do something to try to stop people from using hacked copies or running fake ones or something like that. And then it sounds like it's not just cheating in games, but trying to get people to stop like launching homebrew and down piracy. Really, it's a pirate, which I understand that, you know, I don't I'm not a fan of pirating current games and so forth. But yeah, and I think they should be getting especially with online games. I don't give a shit if you cheat in a single player game. Like if you're cheating in Super Mario Sunshine, or boy, that's a dated reference. Super Mario Odyssey. Well, hell, you can cheat and sunshine too, because that was in the the recent Mario pack. Mario All Stars they did. But if you cheat in those games, I don't fucking care because it doesn't affect anything else. But if you cheat a Mario Kart online, then I'm mad. So Nintendo should be taking steps to prevent that. Right? Exactly. They should be. But I don't know. I think they're the downside, though, is I mean, the device is made, it's based off of an Android device, and it can run native Android. It's like, it's gonna be hard, or it's gonna be easy for people to circumvent all that stuff. That's how we have all this crazy, you know, emulation stuff. I mean, I don't know, it's gonna be hard for them to do it. But I'm sure they'll try. I don't know. Anything that reduces the number of hackers that they have in like Splatoon stuff, I guess. And I can see why they want to get that going in advance of Splatoon three as well. Yeah, yeah, definitely. So that the chat is still talking about fast food. And now they're talking about I see Taco Bell versus Del Taco. I'm gonna come at you with a real hot take. What is the big fucking deal about Mexican pizza? What is it's fucking delicious. It's like one of the only things there that I like. I don't think it's then again, I mean, honestly, the last time I ate at Taco Bell, it was so disgusting. It's like, just give me Del Taco all the time. They're soft. They're trying. Mexican pizza is a gigantic soggy nacho. That is what it is to me. I don't get it. Mike Defton chat says I asked the same thing and I don't get it. I'm gonna Mike Deft. You live in Mexico. Is that is that a pizza? Is that a pizza? I don't think it is. It's just it's just it's a giant stacked torta, I guess. Let's see other comments in chat. Sia Tabiri says Dolly Parton would like a word with you, Rob. I know. I know. Dolly Parton is my queen. But even even the people you hold in the highest highest regard are not perfect people. And Dolly Parton is allowed to make a mistake whenever she wants. But this is this is her mistake. Um, let's see. Kind Volibian chat says Del Taco gets so much slander for no reason. It is amazing. I have to agree that Del Taco is so much better. It's like it's the only place you can get a taco and fries. It's great. I don't like their fries. Their fries are super dry. I can't eat fries anymore anyway. So it doesn't really matter. But I like the tacos. All right. Mike Deft in chat says an actual Mexican pizza. So for the record, for the record, an actual Mexican pizza from our listener who lives in Mexico is a pizza in all caps with traditional Mexican ingredients like chorizo or pepper. I could see that I could see that. That's actually that sounds good. It's like a chorizo as a topping up. That sounds good. Actually, I would not be able to eat it with all the peppers in it. I Yeah, I know. It's you still to this day. My favorite pizza is California Pizza Kitchen's parent Gorgonzola pizza with plenty of roasted garlic on it. The end. That's the best pizza in the world and no one can convince me otherwise. I never thought of chorizo on pizza. Now I'm like, that sounds fucking good. All right. I mean, the peppers that might be a bit much, but we'll see. We'll see. Maybe a little I can handle I can handle a little bit of pepper. I just don't like a ton of it because it peppers one of those things that's just like it dominates the taste. So let's Yeah, like I love I bet though if you deseeded the peppers and roasted them really well, like almost blackened them. It would take some of the heat out of it. Yeah, I mean, I still wouldn't be able to have it because the enzymes will still be active even if they're roasted. But this the heat is in the seeds for the most part. So you deseed it and roast it really well. You get caramelization on it. And the flavor profile would actually work well with the harder chorizo. We have a really good rex Kim restaurant not far from here. And I don't know how authentic it is. Sorry, Mike deaf. But I love to get they have a fajita salad as like my favorite thing on the menu for this current like diet I'm doing. And they put peppers in it. But it's like you said, they blackened them a little bit. So it doesn't like overpower everything else is I love the fajita salad there. It's so good. It's like the perfect lunch for me. Anyway, yeah. St 100 Matt says OLR foodie episode is happening now. Oops, oops. Yeah, well, we've put that off way too long. But that is 100% my fault. So we'll get that scheduled very soon. Mike deaf says if it's run by Mexicans, then I trust it. I believe so. I've never asked but I believe so. So it we we don't usually have a problem finding decent Mexican food in California. Yeah, yeah, it's it's not hard to find but it ain't a Taco Bell. All right. I mean, we we I have everything from super taco to taqueria Vallarta to what's my other taco place? There's the truck that comes to work sometimes. And nothing is as as good as a good taco truck. And then like one of my favorite burger places was actually a chain started by a Mexican family called Tommy's. Oh, yeah. That's the place with the chili on the burgers. Yeah, you you made us detour to a Tommy's. It wasn't that far of a detour. But you were like, we got to get Tommy's way home. Yeah. Yeah. All right. We have one more story for you before we get to the listener roundtable. And that is to talk about what I think is a very interesting turn of fate. And, you know, there's been a lot of talk about Warner Brothers latest Smash esque sort of game called multi versus. In fact, I think people are streaming that on Twitch and stuff right now. I have a sneeze coming on. Thank God I hit the mute button in time. Sorry, guys. Um, so multi versus is like a smash s kind of game that's an alpha right now. Well, apparently the game is good enough or the right agreements have been signed where multi versus is going to be at Evo championship series for 2022. In fact, it's taking smashes spot. Now, you might remember Nintendo pulled smash from Evo. So it's kind of their own fucking fault. So it is very interesting that, okay, well, we're gonna replace smash with a smash esque or a smash inspired, we'll say, type of game instead. So that's very interesting. So yeah, Nintendo had pulled out of Evo. But we just we still don't know why Nintendo pulled out. But then we had the panda global partnership. So maybe it was something like that. But now Evo has multi versus so made this, you know, could Nintendo have shot themselves in the foot by letting this get picked up by Evo. And now the fans are going to focus on it. People are going to practice with this game. You know, I it's it's kind of giving this game a leg up by its ability to be included in Evo. So it'll be interesting to see. Quest Buster says an open beta is slated for multi versus in July. And I've seen a few streams that looks like the devs have a lot of fun with the characters. So Mike Deaf says panda global is partnering with Nintendo and Sony running Evo. So you know, so yeah, it's true Sony Sony bought Evo too. So anyway, let's go to the listener roundtable. Every week we invite your feedback here on the show over at twitch.tv slash vog network. We also take your emails participate at orange lounge radio.com. Dark soccer stepped away for a moment we'll, we'll ask her when she gets back we have any emails I don't think there were. We also invite your calls if you want to join our discord server over at vog network.com slash discord. We chat throughout the week about stuff or if you want to you can join the green room, which is one of our chat channels and we'll take some calls here live on air. If you don't want to do any of that, we'll always be happy to take a chat questions over in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network where they're still talking about multiverses, which is fine because we were just talking about that. While we wait to see if any questions well, let me get some comments here. Tiger class as I think it's good that multiverses will be at Evo. It gives the game of ton of exposure and might have more people wanting to play it. And kind of Vullaby says I've already seen a number of pro smash players trying multiverses and it seems popular with them. I guess time will tell if it's just another fad or not though kind of like Nick all stars brawl. It's true. That one was supposed to be a big one and the shade is real came in when it has all the voice actors in this one. So that's cool. Yeah, it's true. It does. Dark soccer. Do we? I don't think we have anything in the mailbag. But let me check just to be sure. Oh, no, we do not. Alright, so participate at orange launchradio.com. Oh, so I always say when when you don't email us and give us something to talk about, then it's an excuse for dark soccer and I to talk about drag race. Now for the most part in the last year, I haven't bothered to watch drag race because there's just there's too many of them now there's there's the international one. There's the but they just give me a couple of seasons. They just started the all winners one. So all stars all winners started on Friday. And all I'm gonna say I'm not going to spoil because the Paramount thing is weird because now that it's on streaming people watch at different times. All I'm gonna say is this is the shakeup the format has needed for a long, long time. And I'll say I don't think it's a spoiler for me to say the show is now edited to be 99% positive. All the judges critiques positive, all of the edits that the players got during snatch game and during the first challenge, positive, everything was positive. And the show is not hurting because of it. Like it's actually probably the strongest season they've had in a long time. So it was just it's amazing. And all I said that snatch game, you know, again, I don't know if that's just because of editing where they chose to show the positive but I really think like the talent that was in that snatch game like jinx monsoon. That's the tweet. That's like there there there will never be another better there will never be a better game player than jinx months. I love I loved meeting her. She she's just so funny in person. You you have to see the snatch game she does. So can I can I can I tell you who she does? Who does she do? So the twist is that they have to do because before she did little Edie before right did she does somebody different they have to do two characters this time. So they actually do two different snatch games. The first game she does Natasha Lyonne from my Russian doll the redhead right who isn't but I'm here. Oh my god she had the voice because you because you know Natasha Lyonne has a very distinctive raspy voice probably from all the smoking. She had the voice down. The second celebrity she does Judy Garland. It Jamie it was mind blowingly good. Like you laugh until you cry. It was so good. It was so good. You have to watch it like I'll loan you my because I mean, when when what's your name did a Liza Minnelli. That was dead on and I can see jinx pulling off a perfect Judy Garland. I would love to see the two of them together. Yeah. So but but jinx has a really good talent for voices because her little Edie was pretty dead on to Raja does a celebrity. I have to tell you who Raja does one of them at least. Sorry. Sorry, Loki. Just tell me both. Diana Vreeland is one of the ones that she Raja does. And that's that's like the the person that was over Vogue magazine like in the 70s and 80s. So that was that was fine. That was funny. But she does Madam. The puppet from wailing flowers and Madam. It is Jamie. It's, it's so good. It's so good. The winners on the season or is it just a handful of all winners? It's um, it's Raja, jinx, Shea coule\u00e9, Monet exchange, not Bianca, Trinity, the tuck, the Vivian from the UK. Did I say jinx already? Yeah. Oh, Jada, Essence Hall, and Evie Oddly. I love Evie. So it's a really good cast. So even though Yeah, he's also a sweetheart. There's a lot of people that are like, Where's Bianca? Where's Trixie? Where's Alaska? I think these are a lot of girls that like are absolutely like not to say the others aren't worth revisiting. But there are a lot of them are booked and blessed. And I'm sure these winners could be booked and blessed too. But to be on TV again and go through all this is really, really great for them. And it's just Yeah, and I'm sure they're saving some for a potential second season down the line. So I will. I will also tell you that I'm perfectly happy for Tracy to not be on there if I can keep watching her use Easy Bake Ovens. Anyway, I had Dan watching that he was laughing. Jamie, it was a it was a Waylon Flowers and Madam reference. Like only like only people over 40 are gonna understand why that's so fucking funny. But that was the stuff that was on late at night. I will. I will have to go YouTube-ify it. Or just ask me nicely for my Paramount Plus. We actually have Paramount Plus now so Dan can watch Star Trek. Well, then get on it. Eventually, eventually. All right. I got I got shit to do. Like I still have to finish doing the cat video again. I need to send me more pictures of cheddar. Oh, yeah, I need to send you cheddar cat pics for for a redone intro video here for when we're live on Sunday nights. Absolutely. So I'd love to have a new one for our 20th. Because I don't know what else we're gonna have for our 20th. Maybe that should be the foodie episode. Um, I think we should definitely get that done before the 20th. Yeah. So I'll have to check with everyone's availability, though, because I know you're going on a big trip, Jamie, you're not gonna be here next week. So I'm gonna be here next week. It's the week after. Um, I am flying to Illinois on June 2. And I'm returning on the fifth. I'm helping my friend move her cats. You are who has been who you have seen in in my streams, and she's coming here as well. Amethyst Rose, which Oh, yeah, I know the name. Yeah, yeah. My, my friend who also lives around the corner for me. Um, basically, the cats can't go in the car because of, you know, nervous reasons. So we in Delta, which we're taking, we're doing first class, which I've never done first class before. So come on celebrity. Well, I'm doing the the comfort economy on the way back, at least it's the, you know, the comfort seats. But, but because, you know, we got to check the luggage because the cats are going to be a carry on each. And I'm going to be probably really drunk by the time we land. Just saying, what part of Illinois, not Chicago, I guess, just the rest of four hours from Chicago. Okay, without doxing a fellow. Sure, sure. I understand. Yeah. So so but I'm, I would like to go into Chicago, but we're flying into St. Louis. And I said, Okay, you know, it's gonna happen. I double check to make sure I could. We're going to the Waffle House. I checked. I don't miss I did. I already checked. Okay, I was gonna say Missy OLR St. Louis base. So I'd Yeah, cool. I said we are going to the damn Waffle House. You're gonna have the grits and you're gonna like it. No, I'm kidding. I don't if she doesn't like it. She doesn't like it. But um, I like I think I have like three bags of grits that I promised one to my co worker and I might just pick up some more on the way back. Like if I get there early enough, I might stop into a Waffle House. See if the managers there because you can buy grits over the counter 99 cents a bag. Awesome. And at last, I freaking love Waffle House grits now. Now some folks in chat are like, Hey, Jamie's gonna be near me. I want to go drive. Well, I'm gonna be near you briefly because we still have to get those cats. Yeah. To my friend's place. Yeah. All right. Well, that'll be a fun trip. That's that'll be cool. I it's a place I've never been before a couple places I've never been before. I'd love to do a long drive across the country. At some point, but you know, time money. Her her husband, I think is doing the the drive with all the the moving stuff. And we're doing even know either that or they're having movers do it and he's flying on his own to get start getting stuff set up and then we're flying together on it. Yeah. All right. Let me go to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories for tonight to get into because mostly I don't see I didn't see any questions from chat. If I missed it, please ask it again. But most most of chat is just adding to what dark soccer is talking about with her story there. Sadly, there's not really anything last minute. Fair enough. I imagine next week's gonna be a bit of a slow week with it being Memorial Day weekends, a little bit of a long weekend, or maybe that affects the week after I don't know. Oh, all right. Well, then I guess that is going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio. Hey, thank you as always for listening to our show. Whether you were downloading this on the podcast feed or you're watching us live over at twitch.tv slash vog network. Appreciate you be here and appreciate your participation. Don't forget to tell a friend to about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice. But we need more voices here. We have a birthday coming up. It's a pretty big birthday. If you want to get us a gift, tell a friend about the show. That would be a perfect gift for us. Get us some more follows on twitch over twitch.tv slash vog network. Really appreciate all of that. So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this Spotify. What else is out there? I don't even know anywhere wherever whatever you used to find this a going off a long way. So yeah, Mike Deaf says Summer Games Fest is close. So it's the calm before the storm, I guess. Yep. And since there's no E3 this year, those type of summer announcements are just going to be sprinkled throughout the next three months because you'll notice Sony has not staked a claim. And I think they're waiting. I don't think we're going to see Sony in June. I think we're going to see them closer to end of July, August, because they don't have nothing else is forcing them to go earlier. So they're on their own timetable. So be very interesting. So all right. Um, and dark to see you. Yes, I did see what you were working on. But I'll wait and talk about that during the 20th. So let's see. That's it that I can think of. So this is the part where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts. I will start with dark Sakura because I know she's going to do a post stream for y'all. Dark Sakura, your final thought. Um, I need blood points. I gotta feed a legion. All right, good luck with the some growing a teenagers quote finger. Good luck teenagers. Sorry, stabbing and killing in dead by daylight. All right. Exactly. Later taters. Have a good one. Loki will go to you in your final thought for tonight. I just saw that power wash simulator added more levels. So I need to check that out again. My final thought is I was just saying to a friend the other day, I want to play a game like Diablo again, but I don't really want to play Diablo. My friend was like, Oh, Diablo immortals coming out. And I was like, is there anything else? Anything else? I mean, I haven't found engines. Oh, yeah, now they're now you're talking maybe I'll pick up Minecraft Dungeons again. That was kind of fun when I played it. So that'll be fun. So. All right. Wow, as Joe and Matt says, I'm sadly gonna miss the 20th anniversary episode going to a friend's wedding that night a damn Sunday wedding. Well, I mean, it's a good excuse. But you know, it's really funny. Bobby Blackwell is missing our 20th anniversary as well. So you know, I guess if you can be here, it's gonna be a small party. It'll be it'll be a pandemic party. Right? In all seriousness, thank you any week that you're here. We appreciate you. Have a wonderful week, everybody. We'll see you in seven days to do it again. Have a good night. Bye.
