Video games are art, and like all art, they are all what you make of it. They're unique

00:14.120 --> 00:18.620
for all other applications of art because you are a primary part of it. Alongside video

00:18.620 --> 00:22.720
games live, play, and plenty more productions to BBC is getting into the game of orchestral

00:22.720 --> 00:27.720
presentations of select music pieces, and I am pumped to see this. This is one art jumping

00:27.720 --> 00:31.880
mediums and culture story. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to

00:31.880 --> 00:35.120
tell you more about this headline and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the

00:35.120 --> 00:36.800
show where every gamer has a voice.

00:41.200 --> 00:45.920
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where

00:45.920 --> 00:54.240
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode

00:54.320 --> 01:04.600
number 912 for our show for May the first. It is May 2022. I am Rob Roberts and joining me as he

01:04.600 --> 01:07.840
does every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki.

01:08.920 --> 01:09.360
Hello.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.240
How are you doing?

01:11.080 --> 01:12.000
I'm doing better.

01:12.040 --> 01:16.680
Good, good. I was gonna ask you were out last week because you had your surgery. So you're here.

01:16.680 --> 01:21.200
You're looking normal. You're upbeat. So good. We were all hoping it would go this way where you

01:21.200 --> 01:24.880
just you're gonna just go right back into doing the show and all that stuff. But everything's

01:24.880 --> 01:25.480
going well.

01:26.160 --> 01:33.160
Yeah, it's going well. I took a week watch it. I have a few more days off still. Because they're

01:33.160 --> 01:39.480
finishing up the last piece of I guess the recovery where they have to take out the stent that they

01:39.480 --> 01:43.600
put in. So that's tomorrow. So looking forward to that.

01:46.320 --> 01:46.640
Let's

01:46.640 --> 01:49.760
take a moment to reflect on the fact that getting old sucks.

01:51.120 --> 01:56.640
Yes. And I like it too. Like because because you know, the whole kidney stone thing they said, you

01:56.640 --> 02:02.160
know, it's a calcium, they have the different calcium since most of them are calcium. But it's

02:02.160 --> 02:08.560
like, like, you can get it from having too little calcium or too much calcium. It's like, okay,

02:10.080 --> 02:16.400
the whole amount of calcium. Exactly. How am I supposed to know? You know, how much calcium I

02:16.400 --> 02:22.800
should have? And my wife always says that it's, you drink too much milk. I'm like, I hardly drink

02:22.800 --> 02:29.040
any milk at all. I occasionally maybe once or twice a week, I have a bowl of cereal. And that's

02:29.040 --> 02:33.920
it. Like that is hardly drinking too much milk. When I was a kid, I drank milk all the damn time.

02:33.920 --> 02:40.480
So like, this is nothing. Like I, I don't know. It could be a lot of you're not a coffee person.

02:40.480 --> 02:46.000
Like I drink like literally having iced coffee with it's not fat milk, but it's milk in it right

02:46.000 --> 02:53.440
now. So yeah, I don't normally drink coffee. I have I've been, you know, drinking some more of

02:53.440 --> 02:59.200
the Red Bulls recently. But not even that much like maybe once a week. And it's only because

02:59.200 --> 03:05.760
I've had like a bag of these Red Bulls that I've had since last year sitting underneath my desk

03:05.760 --> 03:10.720
here that I wanted to drink them before they expired. So I've been just going through those

03:10.720 --> 03:17.760
slowly. But I've had like maybe five Red Bulls in the 2022 so far. So it's like, hardly nothing.

03:17.760 --> 03:22.880
And she's like, Well, it's because you drink too much of those too. I honestly don't think so. I

03:22.880 --> 03:28.720
mean, like one a day is not that bad. I wouldn't want it should not be a big deal. Let's talk video

03:28.720 --> 03:32.960
games. What is that playing by? I think that I think I caught the title screen earlier. So playing

03:32.960 --> 03:38.240
behind you because we are broadcasting live at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash a VOG network

03:38.240 --> 03:42.880
where we do broadcast live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right

03:42.880 --> 03:47.520
after the Bobby Black Wolf show and sometimes you get some we know it's a podcast we try to be very

03:47.520 --> 03:54.160
aware and not rely too heavily on video. But I sometimes Loki will run video behind him actually

03:54.160 --> 03:59.680
he always because we don't want to see my kitchen No, but um, you've got the Stanley parable, right?

03:59.680 --> 04:05.680
But this is this the new one that like the or whatever, like the ultra deluxe 10 years later,

04:05.680 --> 04:11.200
they've revisited it. That's pretty cool, though. Yeah, yeah, I like that. I get to play it. I need

04:11.200 --> 04:16.080
to ask that if you played it yet, but you know, you're just watching YouTubers run through it.

04:16.800 --> 04:20.240
Yeah, it's interesting how a lot of people will do games that way in this day and age, huh?

04:21.040 --> 04:27.360
Well, I liked it. And I still will pick it up. I just haven't done it yet. I mean, I probably do

04:27.360 --> 04:33.760
it now. I'm not joining us tonight. I need to mention dark soccer or Jamie Summers. You haven't

04:33.760 --> 04:38.560
heard her yet because she's not here tonight. Usually I don't really get into the reasons like

04:38.560 --> 04:44.560
if people take a night off or whatever, like I that's that's y'all's business. Unless you know,

04:44.560 --> 04:48.320
people don't care and they want to they want to say what's going on. For example, Loki disclosed

04:48.320 --> 04:52.400
his surgery on an earlier episode of the show. Dark soccer was very open about our trip to

04:52.400 --> 04:58.320
Disneyland. And she has mentioned this on Twitter. And I think I think this is worth just talking

04:58.320 --> 05:02.960
about and mentioning real quick. So I want to go to Twitter real quick here. The dark soccer put a

05:02.960 --> 05:06.800
tweet up that said I'm not feeling very well tonight. So taking the night off olr and my

05:06.800 --> 05:11.680
stream to rest and tend to my own mental health. Thank you all for understanding. And then some

05:11.680 --> 05:17.840
nice words about Bobby and us. And you know, yeah, we don't, we don't often talk a lot about doing

05:17.840 --> 05:25.040
stuff for your mental health. And, you know, especially when it comes to podcasting, streaming,

05:26.080 --> 05:32.480
things of that sort. It can people oftentimes underestimate the toll that this type of stuff

05:32.560 --> 05:37.520
can have on your mental health. Is that and that's why I've been like, personally,

05:37.520 --> 05:41.520
even though I do streaming on the side, not just olr, but on my own personal channel,

05:41.520 --> 05:45.920
I've sometimes personally resisted wanting to publish a schedule that like, I'm going to be

05:45.920 --> 05:51.120
live on certain such and such day. And that's I realized like 95% of streamers do that. And that's

05:51.120 --> 05:58.000
no shade or nothing. I'm just saying for me, like I, I have had all the time, these things where I'm

05:58.000 --> 06:02.960
like, I'm going to stream tonight. And then when tonight comes around, I'm like, maybe I'm not,

06:02.960 --> 06:08.800
cause I'm not really feeling extroverted tonight. I just kind of want to be a vegetable and play some

06:08.800 --> 06:13.440
dead by daylight on my own terms. And that's going to be that. But then other times I'm like, yeah,

06:13.440 --> 06:16.800
heck yeah, I'm going to get on stream and do that and do it. And I just kind of like to do that sort

06:16.800 --> 06:23.680
of thing on my own schedule. So don't ever like force yourself or push yourself if you're not

06:23.680 --> 06:29.120
like feeling it or whatever. If you like, if that sort of thing is going to be counterproductive to

06:29.120 --> 06:33.920
your mental health, because we don't often talk about that type of stuff enough. And it's

06:33.920 --> 06:38.480
important. You've got to take your time for your mental health and be in a good place like that,

06:38.480 --> 06:45.200
or else you're just going to make the problem worse by, by doing podcasts, broadcasting,

06:45.200 --> 06:48.960
twitching, whatever it is that's out there. And I see a lot of love in our chat room over

06:48.960 --> 06:55.680
twitch.tv slash vog network. Pod culture saying a fucking man quest buster says streamers big

06:55.680 --> 07:00.640
and small take breaks too, because human fifth dream says that is literally my entire life.

07:00.640 --> 07:05.040
I never know from one minute to the next. If I feel like doing a thing physically or mentally

07:05.040 --> 07:10.080
SSU 100, Matt says yourself is the most important thing. Take care of you first before worrying

07:10.080 --> 07:15.520
about others needs. Very well said. Yeah, I can probably elaborate more. It's not even

07:15.520 --> 07:20.720
just streamer stuff, but like YouTube in general to you can get burnt out creator culture. Yeah.

07:21.440 --> 07:27.520
My gaming week, we'll talk about burnout. All right. The stuff that I did. Are you

07:27.520 --> 07:33.760
have you finally had your fill of Minecraft? No, I haven't. I've had fill my fill of a certain

07:33.760 --> 07:42.560
type of gameplay in Minecraft. Because I had a project this week that I built that was extremely

07:42.560 --> 07:48.560
large. It took three weeks to put together. And I was just fed up with doing it. And it came out

07:48.560 --> 07:53.360
really good. I saw the video because you posted it over in our Discord server, which you know,

07:53.360 --> 07:59.040
of course, vog network.com slash discord. And if you aren't already subscribed to Loki on YouTube,

07:59.040 --> 08:05.600
you should fix that. He's Loki o lr on YouTube. Very easy to find. And yeah, so I will get into

08:05.600 --> 08:10.320
the video in a little bit in our gaming weeks that you don't eat of all your gaming week here. But

08:10.320 --> 08:14.080
yeah, it looked very impressive what you were doing in that game. But you also have a lot of

08:14.080 --> 08:20.640
patience to be doing something like that. That's for sure. But then I think he's been very bored

08:20.640 --> 08:27.440
this last week. It wasn't boring at all. Because like I it was basically like, yeah,

08:27.440 --> 08:32.960
the recovery from surgery is basically you couldn't, you couldn't really do like be active.

08:32.960 --> 08:38.800
So I mean, I was on my computer, which is like, that's normal anyways. So it was,

08:39.440 --> 08:44.400
it was instead of working at, you know, eight to five, or nine to five job or whatever.

08:46.080 --> 08:50.640
I was doing Minecraft during that time. And during the time when I normally did so it's

08:50.640 --> 08:57.600
like solid Minecraft, like, well, 14 hour days for like a week and a half just building one thing.

08:57.600 --> 09:02.080
And that was just, I was getting tired by the end.

09:03.760 --> 09:08.320
Bobby Black Wolf in chat, I want to go back to the topic we were just discussing discussing

09:08.320 --> 09:12.240
about the mental health because there's more great comments in chat. And I want to read them.

09:12.240 --> 09:17.280
Bobby Black Wolf says, especially since content creators are basically gig workers, and have to

09:17.280 --> 09:22.880
pay for their own health insurance. So they feel like they can't take time off. There's no PTO for

09:22.880 --> 09:27.840
a full time streamer. That's a huge point. We have a story coming up later on. And I'm sure many of

09:27.840 --> 09:33.600
you have heard about this that's going on. And that is the talk about Twitch changing potentially

09:33.600 --> 09:38.960
some of the rates and the payouts for partners to try to stay profitable. And, you know, that has

09:38.960 --> 09:45.520
this huge impact. It's it's this incredibly uncharted territory, this whole making a living

09:45.520 --> 09:52.560
off being a streamer. And it's, it's it's dangerous. It's risky. And that alone is a can

09:52.560 --> 09:58.480
do a lot on mental health. Because as this news is showing this week, Twitch, Amazon can pull the rug

09:58.480 --> 10:04.160
like that. And there isn't shit you can do about it, quite frankly. Unless Yeah, that's why folks

10:04.160 --> 10:09.040
diversify. I mean, diversify your revenue streams, unless everybody, you know, groups up and does

10:09.040 --> 10:12.960
something together. But yeah, yeah, diversify your revenue streams as very important. Yeah,

10:12.960 --> 10:16.240
because like, even with YouTube, like you don't know, like, if there's gonna be another

10:16.240 --> 10:22.320
apocalypse saying YouTube's algorithms and stuff, it's screwy. They could get content claimed for

10:22.320 --> 10:27.040
nothing. Like it could be your own original content, but someone's trolling it or their

10:27.040 --> 10:31.040
algorithm will decide one day they're going to delete your channel or who knows, like, so you

10:31.040 --> 10:39.440
have to just do merchandise, Patreon, Twitch subscriptions, whatever you can do. Yeah, donations.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.320
Yeah, you know, fog network, we're probably missing out not upping our YouTube presence. We

10:44.320 --> 10:48.080
have a YouTube channel. And there's some good stuff on there. But we're not doing a lot of stuff

10:48.080 --> 10:54.560
regularly. I have ideas. But you know, there's always ideas. There's just the time to put ideas

10:54.560 --> 10:59.680
and emotion which isn't always plentiful. So anyway, I want to get some other comments here.

10:59.680 --> 11:03.760
Pod culture says it's been a couple years and I'm just now feeling the itch to really start

11:03.760 --> 11:12.240
podcasting again. It makes sense. Mike deaf says imposter syndrome is definitely not a joke. That

11:12.240 --> 11:19.280
is so true. And I deal with that a lot a lot more than you guys probably think. From you know,

11:19.280 --> 11:23.600
having listened to this show, as long as y'all have even if this is your first week, you know,

11:23.600 --> 11:27.920
this show has been around for coming up on 20 years now. I deal with imposter syndrome all the

11:27.920 --> 11:33.920
time. I deal with it in my professional life. I deal with it in what I do here. The first time I

11:33.920 --> 11:38.720
did panels at Dragon Con, the first time I did a huge panel at Dragon Con, I dealt with it. I

11:38.720 --> 11:44.160
dealt with it deal with it with a lot of the hosting that I do on the weekends. And some of

11:44.160 --> 11:50.000
the big you know, I I've talked about some of the big names for me. Getting to host like doing the

11:50.000 --> 11:55.120
Twin Peaks panel and stuff that was huge on imposter syndrome for me where I'm like,

11:55.120 --> 11:58.560
there, you know, you're just you're going up there and it's like they're they're gonna know

11:58.560 --> 12:03.600
that you're just a fan who rests the stage. You have no business being up here amongst all these

12:03.600 --> 12:10.960
like actual talented people. And it's it's, it's a real thing. And that absolutely plays into Twitch

12:10.960 --> 12:18.480
when sometimes people think nobody's gonna watch my stream, who cares about my stream and my thing.

12:18.480 --> 12:23.600
And that's why I kind of like urge people. Don't. Nobody is going to watch your stream in the

12:23.600 --> 12:28.560
beginning. Most likely you may have one or two people, your friends and stuff, but it takes a

12:28.560 --> 12:34.800
long time and a lot of being regular and really immersing yourself in Twitch culture and networking

12:34.800 --> 12:41.040
and making friends to grow on this platform. And it takes a long time and a lot of investment.

12:41.040 --> 12:46.800
This isn't just something that happens overnight. And it's, it's a pretty big deal. And look,

12:46.880 --> 12:52.160
I see you talking to chat about, you know, growing on YouTube and it's taken you a long time

12:52.160 --> 12:56.160
just to grow a little bit. And you're still, are you at the monetized level yet?

12:56.160 --> 13:00.320
No, not even close. You're still a lot bigger than you were two years ago.

13:01.520 --> 13:06.240
Yes. And like two years ago, I think I was at a hundred and something. I think I can't remember

13:06.240 --> 13:13.200
what I was like earlier this year, but I think it was like 200 something, like not that long ago.

13:13.200 --> 13:18.640
And I'm up to 350. I've been getting, like, it said about 30 subscribers a month now,

13:19.680 --> 13:23.920
which is pretty nice. It's because I'm kind of changing up my content a little bit and people

13:23.920 --> 13:27.280
are starting to notice. And then you'd be surprised. There's a lot of people that don't

13:27.280 --> 13:31.920
know like who you are, but then they'll find you like, how do you not have more subscribers

13:31.920 --> 13:35.680
or like your content's really good. I don't understand comments on your YouTube. I've seen

13:35.680 --> 13:43.360
them. Yeah. Yeah. It's just like, it's nice to hear honestly. Ironically, though, sometimes,

13:43.360 --> 13:48.640
like the people that say that don't subscribe to your channel, they're like, I don't understand

13:48.640 --> 13:52.480
how you have more subscribers, but that's also, it's hard to say too, because like,

13:52.480 --> 13:57.600
I go to my like YouTube studio dashboard or whatever, and I can't always see who's

13:57.600 --> 14:02.720
subscribing on my channel. I can only see if they share that or something, which is really stupid,

14:02.720 --> 14:06.480
but like, I can't like, and I wish I could see who is subscribed, because then I would call them

14:06.480 --> 14:11.280
out and like say, Hey, thank you, or do something to like, kind of promote that, but I can't,

14:11.280 --> 14:17.120
I can only see if they share it. And so yeah, it's pretty nice. We also just got shouted out on

14:17.120 --> 14:24.560
another like Minecraft kind of compilation channel as well. So that was thanks to my other creator

14:24.560 --> 14:30.000
that's on our server that was sending them tips and stuff. So he got us notice. And that was kind

14:30.000 --> 14:35.600
of nice. And then you know, there'll be the the new server that I'll be participating with later

14:35.600 --> 14:40.960
this summer, which that should really help expand things as well. They're certainly more organized.

14:40.960 --> 14:47.360
And we had a group meeting, they do they do monthly meetings, which is great. So we had a

14:47.360 --> 14:53.360
meeting just yesterday, actually, and that was pretty cool to kind of get to talk to them a

14:53.360 --> 14:57.680
little bit longer and stuff. So I'm hoping all that will help me grow. Really, I'm only trying

14:57.680 --> 15:02.720
to get to right now is 500, which means I can use the community features, which includes like,

15:03.280 --> 15:08.480
posting non video updates, and doing like community polls and stuff like that.

15:09.120 --> 15:15.520
I don't know why the gate that behind 500. It's so stupid, but whatever, you know, it's fine.

15:15.520 --> 15:20.320
We'll do that. And then yeah, someday I'll get to 1000. Then I'll get like, my pennies rolling in.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.920
Getting some other comments in chat. Bobby Blackwell says it's a huge commitment to get

15:25.920 --> 15:29.840
monetized on YouTube. Well, I'll tell you, it definitely doesn't get you monetized. It's doing

15:29.840 --> 15:37.280
nothing, right? You gotta, you gotta try, try, try, try again. Let's see. Quest Buster says a

15:37.280 --> 15:41.520
streamer I tuned into from time to time branch to YouTube, and I've been doing that for a few years

15:41.520 --> 15:45.280
only recently near the beginning of the year, one of their videos finally popped off. And it just

15:45.280 --> 15:50.000
led to more of their stuff being seen. And I think this is very important for us, Joe and under Matt,

15:50.000 --> 15:54.720
who says, always remember, though, that always support folks who are struggling. Jamie is getting

15:54.720 --> 15:58.720
a lot of support right now because we're an awesome community. True. Some streamers don't

15:58.720 --> 16:03.840
always have a close knit community like that. Yes, we've had 2020 years to build this essentially.

16:03.840 --> 16:08.880
Sometimes the hurt people feel isn't obvious. So the moral should always be be cool, be nice and

16:08.880 --> 16:13.760
understanding with folks. You never know what the person is going through. Absolutely. Um,

16:15.200 --> 16:18.880
there was a moment on this show, God, it was probably like 12 years ago at this point,

16:18.880 --> 16:23.840
but every the folks that have been here a long time know this very well. And that was when I had

16:23.840 --> 16:28.480
my diva fit live on air, right. And you definitely remember this Loki, it was when we were in the

16:28.480 --> 16:34.400
garage when I was living with Johnny. And I somebody in like, everything was going wrong

16:34.400 --> 16:39.440
with the show, there was a tech issue, something was going on. And somebody said something in chat.

16:39.440 --> 16:44.480
And I don't even at this point, I don't even exactly remember the comment. But it was something

16:44.480 --> 16:50.240
about like, you know, just another thing breaking down or something like that. And even though the

16:50.240 --> 16:54.480
person probably wasn't meaning to get out of my skin wasn't trying to get under my skin. Like,

16:54.480 --> 16:59.680
I just snapped. And I was just like, well, then fuck it. And fuck this show, basically.

16:59.680 --> 17:06.400
And I stormed off the set, literally stormed off the set. And Loki being the consummate professional

17:06.400 --> 17:13.360
he is, was like, All right, well, let's go to the next story. And finally, this is student news.

17:13.360 --> 17:21.280
I think he Yeah, exactly. And yeah, so you know what, it happens. You never know. And I'm not

17:21.280 --> 17:24.880
saying you know, and again, I don't blame that individual. I don't even think this is the show

17:24.880 --> 17:30.400
anymore. But even if they did, I don't blame that individual. It just sometimes these things happen.

17:30.400 --> 17:34.800
And sometimes the chat comments and stuff, you never know what impact they're going to have.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.320
And yeah, Matt says there was actually something more recently, of course, just a few weeks ago,

17:38.320 --> 17:42.240
when you stopped the show, Rob, I saw you were done. And I saw you just needed to stop for

17:42.240 --> 17:47.600
yourself. Yes, when the tech issues were like, literally mentally. So for the podcast, folks,

17:47.600 --> 17:52.080
you didn't see any of this, because I just didn't put out a show that week. But the live folks here

17:52.080 --> 17:56.480
on Twitch, we started to do a show. And there wasn't usually even if there's only a partial

17:56.480 --> 18:01.840
show, I'll put it out on the feed anyway. But we really only did like 20 minutes. And the tech

18:01.840 --> 18:09.360
issues were just too overwhelming. And I got to a point where I was like, I'm I'm not dealing with

18:09.360 --> 18:14.800
these tech issues anymore. I'm done. And of course, you know what, given give it seven days,

18:14.800 --> 18:20.560
turn it off, and then on again, everything worked magically the next week. And now my phone speaking

18:20.560 --> 18:25.440
of tech issues, my phone thinks I'm yelling at it. But anyway, yeah, I mean, it just sometimes

18:25.440 --> 18:29.920
you just have to step away. And that's exactly what that moment was, was just a whole, I'm

18:29.920 --> 18:36.640
overwhelmed. This is too much. If I don't step away, I'm gonna have another fit. So this time,

18:36.640 --> 18:45.760
I knew to stop it anyway. All right. Plenty plenty of meta stuff. Let's get into some news

18:45.760 --> 18:50.480
for the week going around in the gaming world. We're gonna start off tonight with this story,

18:50.480 --> 18:56.080
which is, this is something else. You know, I think a lot of people heard the story of Balan

18:56.080 --> 19:00.960
Wonderland, or maybe you pre ordered it and you actually bought it and you played it. And maybe

19:00.960 --> 19:06.000
you still enjoyed it. I realized this game has its fans and its apologizers. And that's fine. You

19:06.480 --> 19:12.400
like what you like and go off. But I think we can all kind of see that the community as a whole

19:13.440 --> 19:18.400
rejected this game. It didn't sell as much as it should have, considering it was by the creator

19:18.400 --> 19:22.480
of Sonic and for a Square Enix game. And for the most part, it flopped. And people just kind of

19:22.480 --> 19:28.320
wrote it off as, well, man, Yuji Naka, I guess just couldn't make another good game. That's

19:28.320 --> 19:32.800
too bad. You know, we've all written it off. But now there's a very interesting layer,

19:33.760 --> 19:37.920
layer, la y er, there's another whole new interesting layer that's shown up with this.

19:38.960 --> 19:42.800
Interesting to that actually, now I just stopped me to think this is very interesting coming after

19:42.800 --> 19:49.120
that whole discussion on assuming what a streamer is going through. Well, how about a game developer?

19:49.680 --> 19:57.600
Because yeah, this is very interesting. So Yuji Naka went to Twitter to vent about what happened

19:57.600 --> 20:03.920
with Balamb Wonderworld. He said he was removed as the game's director six months before launch,

20:03.920 --> 20:09.280
and the developer Arzest submitted a final build of the game that wasn't final and it had bugs in

20:09.280 --> 20:14.640
it. Yuji Naka also on Twitter claimed that one of the songs in the game was going to be reworked

20:14.640 --> 20:20.320
for promotional purposes, and not using the track that was straight from the game. Yuji Naka said

20:20.320 --> 20:24.960
that game creators should be able to improve their games until the very end, when he requests to

20:24.960 --> 20:29.360
address issues, and when his requests to address these issues were ignored, he decided to sue

20:29.360 --> 20:35.040
Square Enix. Yuji Naka says if he was kept on as the head of the project, it would have never

20:35.040 --> 20:40.160
released in an unfinished state, and he found that seeing Balamb Wonderworld release in an

20:40.160 --> 20:46.560
unfinished state was a true disgrace. There's a lot of comments that are on Twitter. It's a

20:46.560 --> 20:53.280
little much for me to read, but let me try to get some highlights here. He talked about Sonic.

20:53.280 --> 20:58.800
For example, in Sonic the Hedgehog, two weeks before going gold, we changed the mechanics,

20:58.800 --> 21:04.880
where if you had even a single ring, you would not die. Even up until the very end, we were trying to

21:04.880 --> 21:08.480
improve the game, and I hope that everyone is still enjoying those games today, and I think

21:08.480 --> 21:16.640
everybody knows that mechanic in Sonic the Hedgehog, and that's important, right? He also

21:16.640 --> 21:22.080
says the business relationship with Arzest fell apart due to my comments about Arzest submitting

21:22.080 --> 21:27.040
the final build without fixing bugs, even though there were problems during development, and I was

21:27.040 --> 21:32.960
pushing for further polish. Oshima spoke to the producer Fujimoto about this. Oshima wrote in an

21:32.960 --> 21:37.840
emailed Fujimoto saying, I gathered the development staff and informed them about pushing back the

21:37.840 --> 21:43.120
trial phase of development. This decision was made by producer Fujimoto. Let's do our best for Mr.

21:43.120 --> 21:48.480
Fujimoto. The staff applauded and cheered. This was wholly unexpected, and we were very touched.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.880
The staff who had recently been rather dejected were in an instant revitalized. Thank you very

21:52.880 --> 21:57.440
much. The entire staff will do our best. Yujinaka said, I don't have anything to do with the

21:57.440 --> 22:01.520
development timeline because that is created by the producer, not me, the director. Such tight

22:01.520 --> 22:07.440
deadlines are decided by the producer. Something didn't seem quite right. Personally, I believe

22:07.440 --> 22:12.480
that it is a true disgrace that Balowonder World was released in the state that it was in.

22:12.480 --> 22:17.360
I wanted to show the world an action game in its proper light. Therefore, I believe that Square

22:17.360 --> 22:25.440
Enix and RZest are companies that care about neither games nor their fans. Yep. That's a huge

22:25.440 --> 22:31.760
dagger to throw at Square Enix, which is, you know, with especially such a large company where,

22:31.760 --> 22:38.320
you know, this is the same company that has huge fans and people that feel much differently when

22:38.320 --> 22:42.880
it comes to things like Final Fantasy 14, or I suppose the Final Fantasy series in general.

22:43.600 --> 22:47.920
Um, what are your thoughts hearing all this, Loki? What did you think when you heard about this?

22:47.920 --> 22:54.160
It's unfortunate because like I kind of, I did kind of blame Yujinaka for like how bad this

22:54.160 --> 22:59.200
turned out originally because you kind of look at it like almost like a Mighty No. 9 type of

22:59.200 --> 23:03.760
scenario where it's like, oh, you know, you think you're going to, you know, make this great Megaman

23:03.760 --> 23:07.200
clone or something like that. And it ends up turning out to be garbage. And it's like, well,

23:07.200 --> 23:11.200
maybe you just couldn't do that. And it's like, oh, maybe this is another Mighty No. 9 again.

23:11.200 --> 23:15.200
But we got to remember now that there's also publishers that make really dumb decisions

23:15.200 --> 23:21.600
constantly. Right. And Square Enix is one to do that, to cut corners to, you know,

23:21.600 --> 23:26.320
on some other products like Final Fantasy 14, it's very well put together and stuff. But

23:26.320 --> 23:32.880
I think there's different projects have different levels of upper management kind of oversight on,

23:32.880 --> 23:38.160
whereas like, you know, some of these remasters of the older Final Fantasy games that kind of

23:38.160 --> 23:43.760
get kind of rushed out and look kind of like garbage. And there's like weird bugs and stuff

23:43.760 --> 23:49.280
in them. Like, I think that kind of stuff is kind of, you know, what's the blame here? I wouldn't be

23:49.280 --> 23:55.760
surprised if Arzest got like some sort or maybe management, Arzest got some sort of bonus for

23:55.760 --> 24:00.800
being able to publish the game when they could. So they'd rather release it with bugs, get that

24:00.800 --> 24:08.560
kickback rather than put out a good product. Who knows? Some comments from chat. E3VL says,

24:08.560 --> 24:14.080
worst game of last year for me. Mike Def says, I think Naka is in the right, but also the game was

24:14.080 --> 24:19.520
beyond saving from its development history. Sacred Jade says, I believe Naka-san, Square Enix hasn't

24:19.520 --> 24:24.400
been the best in the last few years. Questbuster says, I agree. The game was in development since

24:24.400 --> 24:29.680
2018 and a lot of core mechanics have had to have been baked in by the time he was dismissed

24:29.680 --> 24:34.160
that the rest of the game had to be built around. Six months isn't really a lot of time to put in

24:34.160 --> 24:41.520
heavy redesign. Yeah. And here's the thing. If he was the producer, though, or, you know, whoever

24:41.520 --> 24:46.400
that was, you know, approving timelines and stuff, you know, maybe if he thought he couldn't get it

24:46.400 --> 24:51.200
done in time, then they would push it back. I mean, I don't know. Well, and that's, and that's

24:51.200 --> 24:56.560
the thing. I do think this story is fascinating. And I do think, you know, it should make us all

24:56.560 --> 25:02.080
think differently about how did a flop become a flop? Did these people set out to make a flop?

25:02.080 --> 25:10.160
No. But did all of their visions on how to get it done get aligned? Clearly not. But, and so I think

25:10.160 --> 25:14.560
there's definitely something to be said here about maybe how fast some of us were to, you know, kind

25:14.560 --> 25:19.280
of say, oh, Yuji Naka made a flop when maybe he really was behind the scenes trying to push back

25:19.280 --> 25:25.280
on some of that. However, all that being said, I will say, I think Yuji Naka did make a key mistake,

25:25.280 --> 25:30.400
a critical mistake. And it's that part in his thing where he talks about the Sonic the hedgehog

25:30.400 --> 25:36.480
and changing that up to, you know, two weeks before the game was released. Sir, you're not

25:36.480 --> 25:41.600
making games to the Sega Genesis anymore. Games don't work the same way that they did

25:42.880 --> 25:49.040
literally 30 years ago at this point. And so, you know, if you want to go all the way back to the

25:49.040 --> 25:57.680
days of the Atari 2600, those games were made by one person. And then when you get into the NES

25:57.680 --> 26:02.640
era, some of the hell some of those games were made by one person. Like you look at balloon fight,

26:02.640 --> 26:07.520
you know, as you know, Satoru Iwata is, you know, one of his, you know, biggest, well known games,

26:08.080 --> 26:11.760
or small teams, if you will, when you get in the NES era, and then getting into the Sega Genesis

26:11.760 --> 26:16.240
still, it was more smaller teams. That's not how games are made anymore. Not a Square Enix

26:16.240 --> 26:21.200
production, right? But like, it's not necessarily I mean, it's still I think, a good example,

26:21.200 --> 26:25.520
though, like just changing game mechanics, but should you really be changing game mechanics two

26:25.520 --> 26:31.600
weeks, you know, right from launch? I mean, I get it. Like, I don't know what he's changing it from,

26:31.600 --> 26:35.520
like, if there's like, oh, you have to have 50 rings in or not to die or something like that.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.720
I don't know what it was before where they decided to drop it down. But that's,

26:38.720 --> 26:43.440
that's like tweaking a value. It's like, okay, well, this boss is going to do 10 damage points

26:43.440 --> 26:46.800
instead of two damage points or something like that. Like that's just like small tweaks. That's

26:46.800 --> 26:52.160
what that's what you do. Like in the part of the whole gameplay testing and balancing phase of

26:52.160 --> 26:57.360
like game development. It doesn't matter the size of the team. But that, right. That's just an

26:57.360 --> 27:02.320
example of like, we constantly work towards making the game better up until launch, right? That that's

27:02.320 --> 27:06.880
what development teams are supposed to do. You don't just go, okay, time to kick back. You know,

27:06.880 --> 27:11.600
it's like, right, you're trying to smash, you know, bugs and stuff like that. But like,

27:11.600 --> 27:16.560
but certain things sounded like there's a lot six months beforehand. They weren't. That's why,

27:16.560 --> 27:21.920
you know, ultimate. So again, this is, I think mistakes were made all around. I don't think

27:21.920 --> 27:25.920
Square Enix Square Enix is certainly not blameless in this scenario. No, I'm not sure

27:25.920 --> 27:34.000
Yuji Naka is 100% the good guy. I think he made mistakes too. And the one thing, you know, I'm not

27:34.000 --> 27:39.360
seeing a lot of that in here. And this discussion for the lawsuit is, you know, what, what did he

27:39.360 --> 27:44.480
learn about himself from this experience? So that's just, that's just something I just kind

27:44.480 --> 27:52.560
of notice. So anyway, I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network as the two 100 Matt

27:52.560 --> 27:57.600
says, seems like there were F your visions. We got to get this game out now because we're invested

27:57.600 --> 28:03.360
too much and need to get a return here. As to 100 Matt says six weeks out, your QA testing should be

28:03.360 --> 28:09.440
done not changing mechanics. Last week, we talked about Xenoblade Chronicles three and how it's

28:09.440 --> 28:16.080
coming out early now. You know how a game comes out early? A lot of planning and getting a lot of

28:16.080 --> 28:25.280
shit locked in well before two weeks before or just releasing it early and hoping for the best

28:25.280 --> 28:29.680
and then putting out a roadmap later on seeing that like, here's how we're going to fix it.

28:30.320 --> 28:36.640
Here's our roadmap and our roadmap of a roadmap. Yeah, so there's two options there. The good and

28:36.640 --> 28:37.200
the evil.

28:38.320 --> 28:43.200
questbuster says huge respect for Naka and his place in gaming history. No one will take that

28:43.200 --> 28:48.320
away. Yes, I agree. But he's still human like everyone else. Absolutely. Right? Exactly.

28:49.760 --> 28:54.080
As like, you know, for example, Mighty number nine, you know, that that's another perfect

28:54.080 --> 29:00.160
example. Like it on paper, that should have been a really fun like Mega Man type game.

29:00.960 --> 29:07.520
It wasn't. On the other hand, then we also have was that that bloodstain rituals of the night or

29:07.520 --> 29:15.200
whatever. Whereas that is a good like Castlevania like game. So some people can do it. Some people

29:15.200 --> 29:22.720
try to do it and they it you know, they can't. It's not as easy as you know, just being a certain

29:22.720 --> 29:27.760
role on a team. You know, it's you're running this company and doing all this other stuff like,

29:27.760 --> 29:31.280
like my number nine had a lot of stuff that was like wrong with it. Like,

29:32.000 --> 29:36.800
when they are start pitching a whole nother game on top of it, like a new Mega Man Legends type

29:36.800 --> 29:42.720
thing. And like animated series and all this stuff. It's like, okay, cool. Let's focus back

29:42.720 --> 29:46.880
on that game that you need to work on, you know, not just all these other projects down the road

29:46.880 --> 29:52.800
like it. Yeah, it's just you have to have the right talents to be able to do just the game

29:52.800 --> 29:58.400
development part and then all the other publishing and stuff parts as well. Because if you don't,

29:58.400 --> 30:00.960
then it'll fall apart even if you are a talented developer.

30:01.760 --> 30:06.480
I'm hoping I'm pronouncing this right. I'm sorry if I'm not in chat. Godets in chat says it's

30:06.480 --> 30:10.240
interesting. I've played a lot of teamfight tactics and League of Legends over the years.

30:10.240 --> 30:14.800
So I'm pretty used to constant changes to my game. But those are free to play models. Yeah,

30:14.800 --> 30:19.520
exactly. It's not something where, you know, they're taking pre orders, getting your money up

30:19.520 --> 30:24.080
front, you know, to deliver a game on a certain date. I think usually the vision of those free

30:24.080 --> 30:30.560
to play games is usually it's it's that, you know, they're going to grow their subscribers over time.

30:30.560 --> 30:36.240
That's what success looks like to a free to play game. It is very rare. You have a game like

30:36.240 --> 30:42.480
Pokemon Go, that has gazillions of players out the gate. That's not the model of success. And

30:42.480 --> 30:47.280
that's not even when this has been discussed many times. That's not what Niantic was expecting

30:47.280 --> 30:52.960
either. Is that game be huge at the gate. It's all about growing your base with those games.

30:52.960 --> 30:59.920
It is a much different model to approach anyway. But yeah, Yuji Naka, he's human. It'll be

30:59.920 --> 31:03.760
interesting to see how this plays out in the coming months. But it definitely puts a whole

31:03.760 --> 31:09.200
other spin on this conversation. Anyway, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the

31:09.200 --> 31:12.960
types of video games that we have been playing this week. Loki, you were talking a little bit

31:12.960 --> 31:18.960
about it. But how was your recovery gaming week? My gaming week was all Minecraft because I had a

31:18.960 --> 31:26.480
large project that I decided to do. So in my S&P series on nerdcraft, I've been working on this

31:26.480 --> 31:33.200
whole steampunk, you know, build. And so part of that is going to be building a city, you know,

31:33.200 --> 31:39.040
a steampunk city or something. So I was trying to terraform everything to make the land kind of,

31:39.040 --> 31:44.880
usable to build buildings on it. And I realized it was just really flat and boring. And so like

31:44.880 --> 31:50.160
my other folks, since we have it like broken up with different factions, so they have like the

31:50.160 --> 31:57.040
folks that are building mountains, and one doing like gothic architecture. And then I think

31:57.040 --> 32:01.680
somebody else was doing something. But the mountain stuff looked really cool. And I was like,

32:01.680 --> 32:07.680
well, it'd be cool to build like a mountain. And then my project got over scoped to hell. So like,

32:07.680 --> 32:14.240
it took forever to clear out the land that was in there. Then I ended up going into a creative test

32:14.240 --> 32:21.680
world, designing a mountain, basing it off of like some of the block pallets and stuff in this mod

32:21.680 --> 32:27.680
Terralith, which has these really, Terralith is awesome. It has like a really beautiful landscape

32:27.680 --> 32:34.960
and everything in all these different mountains and just amazing landscapes. So I based it off

32:34.960 --> 32:40.000
of that. And then I decided because I'm a perfectionist, I need to put real Minecraft

32:41.520 --> 32:48.080
caves inside these mountains. So I also grabbed some of those out of my world and kind of

32:48.720 --> 32:53.760
build the schematics around all that stuff. So after I had all that done, and then I because

32:53.760 --> 32:58.720
originally the schematic was like 4 million blocks, I was like, nope, not doing that because

32:58.720 --> 33:05.200
it was solid. So I hollowed it out, which took forever. And then once I had it all hollowed out,

33:05.200 --> 33:11.360
it had the schematic in place, I needed to gather about 90,000 blocks to start building. And that's

33:11.360 --> 33:19.040
90,000 outside of like the actual smoothing of the landscape to match the land around it. So

33:19.040 --> 33:24.480
the landscape smoothing itself also took about another, I think it was like 120,000. I don't

33:24.480 --> 33:31.520
know, it ended up being roughly just over 200,000 blocks at the place or remove or it was a lot. So

33:33.280 --> 33:38.000
that took several weeks just to design it. And then once I got it took like a week or something

33:38.000 --> 33:44.720
to clear out the space, and then to actually build everything took like a week and a half to two

33:44.720 --> 33:49.520
weeks. And when I say a week and a half to two weeks, I'm not talking about like, after work each

33:49.520 --> 33:57.280
day, it was during my recovery time, I was putting in 12 to 14 hour days playing Minecraft,

33:57.280 --> 34:04.160
doing this stuff. So it's it was a massive project, like massive, massive project.

34:04.960 --> 34:09.040
So I'm showing the video for the Twitch people. And for the folks on the podcast, of course,

34:09.040 --> 34:12.640
you can see it too. And I would urge you to go check it out over at Loki o lr on YouTube.

34:12.640 --> 34:17.120
But this this mountain, we're looking at a Minecraft, you built that? Yep, one brick

34:17.120 --> 34:26.560
at a time. Yep, one one block at a time. It's hollow. So it's, it's, it, it, you know, it's

34:26.560 --> 34:32.480
a lot less material. So yeah, but yeah, the time lapse on that video is great. I the music and

34:32.480 --> 34:36.560
everything. It turned out really well. But yeah, there's actual keys in there. In fact, I think I

34:36.560 --> 34:41.440
actually a little bit later in the clip here, I end up like going into one of the caves that kind

34:41.440 --> 34:49.360
of show it off. But yeah, we can just yeah, it's there you are in the cave. Yeah, there's one of

34:49.360 --> 34:54.320
the caves that I was in. So like it actually has caves and I lit up everything so that mobs will

34:54.320 --> 35:01.840
spawn in there. But yeah, that was like when I watch your videos, I'm so inspired to play

35:01.840 --> 35:08.000
Minecraft. And then I do play Minecraft. And then I remember how fucking bad I am at it that like,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.240
I need to not play survival mode. That's the thing.

35:11.120 --> 35:15.840
Play survival. There's a lot of stuff that they've changed nowadays. It makes it a lot easier

35:15.840 --> 35:21.520
like lighting up stuff. Like monsters don't come out unless there's light level zero. So you can

35:21.520 --> 35:25.760
put fewer torches and stuff. Here's what I didn't finish the story. Here's what really happens Loki

35:25.760 --> 35:29.120
and they'll start playing Minecraft. I'm like, this is too hard. And I'll be like, I'll go play

35:29.120 --> 35:34.720
No Man's Sky because that's like Minecraft enough. Yeah, that's that's what ends up happening.

35:35.680 --> 35:40.800
Anyway, check out check out that video over at YouTube Loki o lr. Of course,

35:40.800 --> 35:43.760
so I don't want to show the whole thing. But I had to share. That's fine.

35:45.200 --> 35:50.640
But yeah, it's so it was a massive project. And it was my fault for making it too because like,

35:50.640 --> 35:55.200
I started off in the mountain wasn't that big. And I was like, it doesn't look that great.

35:56.720 --> 36:00.960
And so it just kept getting bigger. And then it kept getting more elaborate. And it was just

36:01.920 --> 36:08.080
what I should have done is broke it up for multiple videos. But I just didn't,

36:08.080 --> 36:13.920
I just wanted to finish it. And so I did it on one and it's really way too much for one video.

36:13.920 --> 36:18.880
It was and then fortunately, like I looked at the time like the last video I'd released before that

36:18.880 --> 36:24.720
was my April Fool's video, which was on April 9. And this is like almost three weeks later. So it

36:24.720 --> 36:31.520
I try not to space that out that much because I want to make sure that I have, you know,

36:31.520 --> 36:36.640
my content in there. I try to get stuff out at least every week or two weeks. I did put a

36:36.640 --> 36:43.600
hardcore one in between those but it's just you know, it turned out really well. Now I can just

36:43.600 --> 36:50.000
go focus on buildings and stuff and not actually doing more landscape stuff. I'll do some landscape

36:50.000 --> 36:56.880
stuff, but it's gonna be a lot less big like this. But it just, yeah, it turned out really

36:56.880 --> 37:02.560
well. So hopefully it gets noticed. Because, yeah, it took a lot of time.

37:04.720 --> 37:10.160
My gaming week, a lot of the same stuff for me as well. A lot of Final Fantasy 14,

37:10.160 --> 37:14.880
I was streaming that I've been leveling Sage in that game. So I'm, I think I've got Sage up to

37:14.880 --> 37:20.480
85 or 86 now. So I'm getting really close to 90. And yeah, so I did a couple of streams.

37:21.360 --> 37:25.120
Shane was on there and we were running dungeons talking about random stuff. I'm very thankful.

37:25.840 --> 37:30.000
Shane will stream with me. So I have someone to talk to because then that way it doesn't matter

37:30.000 --> 37:33.680
if like no one's watching, we're able to have a conversation. It's really nice. So that's been

37:33.680 --> 37:42.800
fun to stream. Also been playing. I think I sometimes understate how much I play some of the

37:42.800 --> 37:49.280
mobile games like Pikmin, which, I mean, Pikmin is really like a set it and forget it kind of game

37:50.320 --> 37:55.600
when you're like planting flowers and stuff. But those games really do incentivize the walking

37:55.600 --> 38:00.320
that I do and the exercise that I've been getting. And I've been very transparent here on this show

38:00.320 --> 38:06.720
that I made a lot of changes with a lot of my lifestyle stuff about six months ago. And today

38:06.720 --> 38:14.560
I hit a landmark of 45 pounds lost since last summer, basically. And a lot of that is

38:15.360 --> 38:22.640
gamification of walking through things like Pokemon Go, Ingress somewhat. And Pikmin has

38:22.640 --> 38:27.120
been huge with it because Pikmin Bloom came out right around the time all that started happening.

38:27.120 --> 38:32.240
So it's been hugely like motivational for that stuff. So if it seems like I'm always talking

38:32.240 --> 38:36.560
about the same games. I also sometimes don't talk enough about some of them that I really I

38:36.560 --> 38:42.160
do put a lot in because it it incentivizes the real world moving around stuff that I need to be

38:42.160 --> 38:50.240
really doing a lot right now. So I just hit level 55 or am I 56? I'm somewhere in there in Pikmin.

38:50.240 --> 38:54.720
So I'm getting pretty pretty. I'm at the point where my level is in silver, it changes to silver

38:54.720 --> 39:01.040
at 50. So I know the level cap is 100. So someday, I'll get there. I'll try and keep trying.

39:02.960 --> 39:06.720
Otherwise, I actually I actually played a little bit of Dead by Daylight today,

39:06.720 --> 39:10.480
which I haven't been playing as much of that lately. But they're doing an event this weekend,

39:10.480 --> 39:15.360
they just launched a new rift. I don't think it's our show notes tonight. So they made a big deal

39:15.360 --> 39:22.880
that they they have announced that one of their characters is gay. And as part of the you know,

39:22.880 --> 39:30.160
they know they know that the LGBTQIA plus community keeps them afloat on Twitch. And so

39:30.240 --> 39:33.680
it's one of those things where they knew they needed the representation of the game. So they

39:33.680 --> 39:42.240
did it. Um, a lot of different hot takes on it. Some folks feel that, you know, this character

39:42.240 --> 39:47.040
has been out for six years. And it said, does it seem like it's a little bit pandering? Like,

39:47.040 --> 39:52.080
I get it. Like, it's good to have representation. But it's also like, kind of pandering. Yeah,

39:52.080 --> 39:56.560
yeah, both those things can be true, is that it's nice to have representation. But it does

39:56.560 --> 40:01.200
feel a little bit like pandering. Now, at least I'll say this, it's not June. So at least they're

40:01.200 --> 40:06.320
doing it outside of Pride Month. And they released a really nice new pride charm, they they have the

40:06.320 --> 40:13.200
new progress pride flag is available in game to redeem to which is nice. You know, and again,

40:13.200 --> 40:15.840
it's one of those things where it's like, well, I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth.

40:15.840 --> 40:21.760
I'm glad the representation is there. That's cool. But does it feel a little bit like,

40:22.000 --> 40:27.120
gosh, a lot of players are leaving our game. I hope the gays don't leave us. We better throw

40:27.120 --> 40:32.160
them a gay character. And you know what, let's make the most conventionally stereotypically

40:32.160 --> 40:37.520
hot one, the gay one, the shirtless one, the gay one. And sure enough, that's what we got.

40:37.520 --> 40:43.760
And so there's a little bit of, I don't know, there's just a little bit of, hmm, hmm. But

40:44.320 --> 40:49.840
but I'm not complaining. But it's also just dead by daylight. It's whatever.

40:51.680 --> 40:55.440
But I want to make clear, that's not the reason why I started playing again. I mean, it's neat.

40:55.440 --> 40:59.840
And I did log in to get the new pride flag. That was more of a big deal than the character to be

40:59.840 --> 41:03.280
quite honest, because I don't care about lore. Dark soccer, she cares about lore. Maybe she

41:03.280 --> 41:06.640
has more of an opinion on that. We can ask her next week. But I don't really care about lore.

41:06.640 --> 41:14.000
I just care about the game. So anyway, but they have the double rift tokens going on right now.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.440
And you know, that means you can earn cosmetic rewards, which is kind of fun. So I've been

41:17.440 --> 41:23.840
playing a little bit of that. So all right, let's move on and get into some other gaming news for

41:23.840 --> 41:30.720
the week. And Loki is going to start us off tonight, talking about, you know, some schedules,

41:30.720 --> 41:35.600
some schedule not changes, some things, some things just stay the same, I guess.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.400
Some things just, you know, some things the venue was already rented.

41:39.200 --> 41:47.120
Right. So Microsoft in well, Bethesda, and now Microsoft are going to be continuing

41:47.120 --> 41:54.800
the tradition of having a presentation that interrupts our show on June 12. So they're

41:54.800 --> 42:02.080
going to be doing the Microsoft and Bethesda not E3 showcase that will show off what's going to be

42:02.080 --> 42:10.640
coming up on their Xbox and PC and game pass ecosystems. Cool. I'm excited.

42:10.640 --> 42:15.040
Yeah, it's it's actually even though there is no E3 this year.

42:15.680 --> 42:20.480
It's actually at 10am. Oh, my mistake. Yeah, it won't interrupt our show this time.

42:20.480 --> 42:25.680
But it's it's nice that they're keeping some of the pomp and circumstance that gamers come to

42:25.680 --> 42:30.720
expect from June. So it's nice to see that Microsoft slash Bethesda is kind of holding

42:30.720 --> 42:35.360
down the fort, so to speak. And now that it's both those companies at the same time, because

42:35.360 --> 42:39.920
I don't, you know, with the pandemic and everything, we haven't really had a traditional

42:39.920 --> 42:45.840
event in a while. So it'll be kind of neat to see Microsoft and Bethesda sort of joining forces

42:45.840 --> 42:49.440
for this this year in a little, which I would assume is going to be a little more

42:50.320 --> 42:56.400
feel a little more traditional, maybe. So yeah, and I would bet that they booked the venue

42:57.280 --> 43:03.360
a year ago. Probably probably before there wasn't going to be an E3.

43:05.120 --> 43:11.600
Anyway, do I dare ask or is it just stupid to ask? What do you think they're going to show?

43:12.400 --> 43:17.840
What do you think we're going to get? I mean, Starfield, Fable, probably more content for

43:17.840 --> 43:25.120
Halo Infinite. I don't know. Microsoft has so many studios now. I mean, there could be a plethora of

43:25.120 --> 43:30.960
things that they could show. Yeah, I think start a Starfield with the game. We know Starfield's

43:30.960 --> 43:36.320
coming out in November, unless they push it back, which they could always do. But I think they will,

43:36.320 --> 43:41.680
you know, Bethesda is not afraid to release a game with bugs. So Starfield will probably still come

43:41.680 --> 43:46.240
out in November. So I would fully expect we're going to get a deep dive in Starfield in June.

43:47.040 --> 43:52.400
I am pretty hyped about that. I like space. So I'm curious, you know how that game is going to look

43:52.400 --> 43:59.360
and play. I'm hoping it's Elder Scrolls in space. I really am. So we'll see. Speaking of Elder

43:59.360 --> 44:05.520
Scrolls, I'm not expecting that we see Elder Scrolls 6, but I'd be really excited if we got

44:05.520 --> 44:10.000
a little more than what we've had so far, like another teaser. You know, I think because Starfield

44:10.000 --> 44:15.280
is this year, it would be silly to expect Elder Scrolls 6 is also this year. I think that game is

44:15.280 --> 44:22.320
probably still two years away, but I would be excited for new Fallout, not 76. Although we

44:22.320 --> 44:28.560
probably will get some Fallout 76 content that they'll probably show off. But another huge thing

44:28.560 --> 44:32.240
I want to see, and I'm so excited about it because I do think it'll be, I think this is going to be

44:32.240 --> 44:39.680
a this year release, the Fable game from, you know, the Forza Horizon team. I am fucking excited

44:39.680 --> 44:43.040
about that. And I'm thinking June is when we're going to get to see some actual footage. There

44:43.040 --> 44:49.280
better be some really awesome, like some really awesome wagon racing in that game.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.040
Now you want them to make an Oregon Trail game.

44:56.320 --> 44:59.360
Where you can, you can race the Oregon Trail and for the

44:59.360 --> 45:08.160
I want it like Oregon Trail, but literally with the horizon. The horizon, not horizon, with the

45:10.160 --> 45:15.600
yeah, like with with the the modern Racing D aesthetic to it, like, you know, this Oregon Trail,

45:15.600 --> 45:20.080
I want the same radio stations in there, even though it's completely unrealistic, like I just

45:20.080 --> 45:27.200
want it. Absolutely. Just that. Okay. Modern Oregon, Oregon Trail. I'm down. I'm down. I

45:27.200 --> 45:34.560
think that's exciting. All right. Let's see. I guess we should move on to our next story.

45:36.160 --> 45:41.120
Which of course, bear with me a little bit here. All right. So let's talk a little bit about

45:41.120 --> 45:49.440
PlayStation Plus, because we're gonna get the new PlayStation Plus and the, you know, the new

45:49.440 --> 45:53.200
cloud stuff. Well, it's not really new, but there's a whole bunch of new stuff getting

45:53.200 --> 45:59.200
added to it. We're getting that later in June, which by the way, have we had Sony confirm that

45:59.200 --> 46:03.440
they are planning something for June? We haven't had them confirmed yet, right?

46:03.440 --> 46:10.160
Think so. They do their own thing. But I mean, all of these changes are supposed to happen what

46:10.160 --> 46:16.080
like around like June 13, or something, which is very conveniently timed right around that,

46:16.080 --> 46:21.200
right? Or not E3. June 13 is when it's supposed to launch in the US. So I mean,

46:22.080 --> 46:26.720
it's very conveniently timed to have an unveil of what all is going to be in that. But anyway,

46:27.520 --> 46:34.800
anyway. However, even though this is Sony's answer to Game Pass, in some ways, it's not going to fall

46:34.800 --> 46:39.680
for the same stuff that Game Pass fell for. Meaning, if you're trying to stack up your

46:39.680 --> 46:45.600
subscription to get many free years of the ultimate PlayStation Plus, tough cookie,

46:45.600 --> 46:52.800
you cannot do it. It's already been shut down. Sony has temporarily disabled the ability to stack

46:52.800 --> 46:57.920
PlayStation Plus subscription time ahead of these new changes that are coming in June.

46:58.560 --> 47:03.840
The company will take the longest running active subscription when setting the converted memberships

47:03.840 --> 47:08.720
end date. So basically, you could stock up on regular Plus cards to get the same time as a

47:08.720 --> 47:13.840
premium subscriber you could have before, but you can't do that anymore. And more information has

47:13.840 --> 47:19.600
come out since then about exactly how many days things will convert to. So it's like if you have

47:19.600 --> 47:24.160
like a PlayStation now it only converts like 18 years later. So anyway, if you didn't get in on

47:24.160 --> 47:30.160
this early, it's already been shut down. So yep, cool. Glad they're doing everything they can to

47:30.160 --> 47:35.520
make it not a good deal. Orange writing chat says my current subscription lasts until March 2024.

47:35.520 --> 47:40.320
Well, lucky you, lucky you because you get got in on that before they changed everything. So

47:41.760 --> 47:47.760
yeah, I'm curious what the new PlayStation Plus is going to look like with all the retro games. But

47:47.760 --> 47:51.120
you know, it just kind of depends on what's in there, I think a little bit.

47:51.120 --> 47:58.080
So but we're starting to get our first glance at what might be in there. Because

47:59.120 --> 48:04.080
apparently some of the games that are going to be on the premium PlayStation Plus,

48:04.080 --> 48:11.680
they're starting to leak onto the PlayStation Network. Users on Reddit found new listings for

48:11.680 --> 48:17.280
classic titles with new thumbnail art. And apparently they're starting to show up within

48:17.280 --> 48:23.440
that PSN backend. So these would be games that are very likely for PlayStation Plus. So games

48:23.440 --> 48:31.120
that have been discovered so far Tekken 2 from Namco, Mr. Driller, and Ridge Racer for the PSP

48:32.000 --> 48:37.840
all have been spotted on there. But that's it. So that's only three games out of what like 450

48:37.840 --> 48:44.640
that we know of so far. But I mean, I'm excited to see Ridge Racer coming back. I wish it was a new

48:44.640 --> 48:51.040
Ridge Racer. But I also mentioned Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party as well. Yes, those got

48:51.040 --> 48:56.160
spotted later. So a few days later, they found Yeah, those two games as well. So but we don't

48:56.160 --> 49:02.400
have any official confirmation from Sony as of yet. Orange Wright says cool to see PSP games.

49:02.400 --> 49:07.600
Yes, we actually we did know that PSP games were coming out as part of this too. What we don't know

49:07.600 --> 49:12.480
yet PlayStation Vita, they never did confirm that. So I wouldn't expect PlayStation Vita.

49:13.280 --> 49:17.280
And that might have to do with the backtouch panel maybe making a lot of games. But there's

49:17.280 --> 49:22.560
a lot on the Vita that wouldn't need that you would think I don't know. Well, they did put out

49:22.560 --> 49:33.520
a console called the PlayStation TV that doesn't have a back panel. So I guess. All right. Well,

49:33.520 --> 49:41.280
let's move on. More updates in Sony's world sort of right. Yep. So apparently, there's rumors

49:42.080 --> 49:46.880
that Final Fantasy 16 is near the end of development, according to the producer.

49:47.200 --> 49:57.040
Um, so I guess we'll be seeing this soon. Maybe if it's something in June, I think it's about time

49:57.040 --> 50:04.320
we're gonna see some more, you know, the last the last 10% is also the last 90%. So it could be wild,

50:04.320 --> 50:12.480
you know? So we'll see. But yeah, Final Fantasy 16. Well, something to consider to when that game

50:12.480 --> 50:18.400
was first unveiled, what about a year ago at this point, right? When that game was first unveiled,

50:18.400 --> 50:22.640
it was really far along like just in what you were seeing in the trailer and all that stuff. I mean,

50:22.640 --> 50:28.400
they were running it on a PC emulating PlayStation. But I mean, still, like just with the cutscenes

50:28.400 --> 50:33.120
you were seeing, they showed in game combat footage and stuff like that. So like, the game

50:33.120 --> 50:38.800
did seem like it was pretty far along at that point last year than it has been the most games

50:38.800 --> 50:44.160
are when they announce them. So, you know, but again, obviously, I want the game to be good.

50:44.160 --> 50:50.640
I so I want them to take their time and just get it right. But you know, again, with Yoshida

50:50.640 --> 50:55.120
producing it, who has basically saved the Final Fantasy franchise with Final Fantasy 14, in my

50:55.120 --> 51:02.640
opinion, I, I have big expectations for this game, which is probably a dangerous thing. But I really,

51:02.720 --> 51:10.240
I really, really can't wait for it. So like, I hope it's this holiday. But I will wait longer

51:10.240 --> 51:14.320
if I need to for the game to be right, I guess is what I'm trying to say. I need to go back and

51:14.320 --> 51:19.440
finish the Final Fantasy seven remake and stuff and 15. It's pretty good. Seven is pretty good.

51:19.440 --> 51:27.120
15 is okay. 15 is worth your time. But I did find the last sequence to be a bit of a letdown,

51:27.120 --> 51:31.120
although it did have a good ending. I will say the ending scene was more satisfying than most.

51:31.760 --> 51:36.480
I'm so just, I don't even want to call it old school. I'm just old at this point. But like,

51:37.360 --> 51:44.320
I missed the term Bates Final Fantasy games. Like, that's what it was. This is this fast

51:44.320 --> 51:50.560
actions too fast for my feeble elderly hands. According to the internet, you know,

51:50.560 --> 51:55.120
because like, elderly is 25 now. So get good. I don't really know what that's. I don't really

51:55.200 --> 52:01.680
look at me. But like, get good. I guess like, I don't know, like, I just want to like,

52:01.680 --> 52:06.160
I just want to relax and be able to strategize on like, what I need to do and not like have to

52:07.040 --> 52:11.600
do all that. I don't know. Remember, Final Fantasy 15 did have two modes. It had the

52:11.600 --> 52:17.440
normal weight mode or whatever. I know it did. And I played the demo and the demo was

52:18.160 --> 52:25.200
fine, I guess. But like, it's just not the same. You know, like, I like I miss, like, honestly,

52:25.200 --> 52:29.760
when we were looking at Final Fantasy games, like how they kind of work. Like Lost Odyssey was a

52:29.760 --> 52:35.680
great Final Fantasy game like that. That's how it should be like, modern, modern game with like,

52:35.680 --> 52:40.160
the Final Fantasy combat. I mean, that's kind of what it is. Well, some would argue go play

52:40.160 --> 52:49.280
Octopath Traveler. That's what Square Enix is doing now. Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

52:49.280 --> 52:53.360
I have a live coming out soon. I'm just I'm just stubborn. I guess I don't know. I just need to

52:53.360 --> 52:57.120
give it another chance. That's like why I haven't really played like Kingdom Hearts either. Because

52:57.120 --> 53:03.040
like, oh, yeah, I still buy them for some stupid reason. But like, I haven't played the kids.

53:03.840 --> 53:08.480
The kids don't play those games. Some day. They don't play those games. Like, yeah, sure.

53:10.720 --> 53:17.840
Yeah, so like, I help you. And now you are like, um, yeah, I don't know. I want to enjoy those

53:17.840 --> 53:21.680
games. But they're so convoluted. Like Final Fantasy 15. Like kind of bored me. Like,

53:21.680 --> 53:26.480
I couldn't really follow the storyline. It was just, I don't know. I didn't give it much of a

53:26.480 --> 53:31.440
chance. But I'll go back to it at some point. I don't know. Bobby Blackwolf and chat says

53:31.440 --> 53:37.360
persona is a great turn based JRPG. But it's a time commitment. Bobby, Bobby, Bobby. I'm so

53:37.360 --> 53:43.520
disappointed. That was the perfect opportunity for you to say your kooza like a dragon is a

53:43.520 --> 53:49.920
great JRPG. And it is that is a great way to play it again. And you that is like opportunity you

53:49.920 --> 53:57.040
know, you windows close now that you you are correct. That is a great RPG. And I do love

53:57.040 --> 54:02.960
that game. And that is a game I do need to go back and finish. I just need to get my Xbox Series X

54:02.960 --> 54:07.920
back from my sister who's been borrowing it for the last four months. So I need to get that back

54:07.920 --> 54:12.880
so I can finish that game. But yes, that is a great game. And I hear it has a great story. So

54:14.080 --> 54:21.040
more of that, please. Like I will take you know, I'll take the kooza games are fun. I like that,

54:21.040 --> 54:24.720
you know, but like, let's put that same team on like something else to like, you know,

54:25.760 --> 54:30.400
yes, they are. They're now making that's now the main Yakuza series. So yes, they will be

54:30.400 --> 54:38.000
making some nice roast muffin in our chat. Hello, hello says the seven remake is the best of the

54:38.000 --> 54:44.160
like action based Final Fantasy. And I do I definitely agree the seven remake was far better

54:44.160 --> 54:49.440
than it had any right to be like honestly, and just that one was okay. I maybe I can just ease

54:49.440 --> 54:56.720
myself into that type of gameplay with seven and then go into 15. And yes, here's the thing about

54:56.720 --> 55:01.120
seven like and I don't know how much you've spoiled yourself on the story. And quite frankly,

55:01.120 --> 55:05.280
we're far past the moratorium on spoilers. And I ought to be able to talk openly about it now.

55:05.280 --> 55:11.360
However, no, I'm gonna buy my tongue for the listeners. But I'm just gonna say, again,

55:11.360 --> 55:18.720
the story in seven. Like you, you think you know, what's gonna happen. And I assure you,

55:19.520 --> 55:24.960
you do not know what's going to happen. And it's it's worth playing. Because I think that

55:24.960 --> 55:32.160
commentary in and of itself is very good. Like again, like this, the seven remake is really

55:32.160 --> 55:40.160
worth playing just on the commentary of remakes in general. I'll say that much. It's very interesting.

55:40.800 --> 55:48.080
So play it. All right. But I know I know how it goes. Look, you have a 200,000 brick mountain to

55:48.080 --> 55:55.760
make in Minecraft. You have no fucking time. I'm done with the brick mountain for now. But yes,

55:55.760 --> 56:02.240
I would need to go back. Yes, I would need to. Well, no, see, that's the thing like and going

56:02.240 --> 56:05.680
back to the whole content creation thing. You don't know what's going on behind the scenes.

56:05.680 --> 56:10.400
Like, I feel like constantly, it's like, okay, video put out now, clock reset, but it's still

56:10.400 --> 56:15.280
ticking. You know, it's like, I gotta go out and put more stuff out, especially my hardcore series,

56:15.280 --> 56:19.040
because there's that's what's bringing the viewers is that so like, I got to give the

56:19.040 --> 56:25.520
people what they want. And so E3VL in chat says Final Fantasy seven remake is essentially a

56:25.520 --> 56:32.480
multiverse game. That's about as far into spoiler territory. I'm going to let you go. But yes. Yes.

56:32.480 --> 56:39.760
And that's, that's what yeah, the multiverse is all the rage right now. So I know I'm excited.

56:40.000 --> 56:45.280
And let me tell you again, while we're talking multiverse, you must see the movie everything

56:45.280 --> 56:51.600
everywhere all at once. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. And I apologize if I'm

56:51.600 --> 56:57.600
hyping this up too much. But I really urge you don't read anything about the movie. Just go see

56:57.600 --> 57:04.320
it and you will be so so satisfied. It is just it is just a good fucking movie. And it does. It goes

57:04.320 --> 57:09.360
to show that movies do not have to be gigantic budgets, like Marvel style movies. That's no shade

57:09.360 --> 57:13.520
on Marvel. Because you know, those those movies have their place too. But I am super excited

57:13.520 --> 57:17.200
about Dr. Strange. Yeah, I know. And lots of people are and that's great. I'm excited. But

57:18.000 --> 57:23.520
just just and Michelle Yeoh, end of sentence, Michelle Yeoh, period. End of sentence. That's

57:23.520 --> 57:27.760
all that needs to be said. Michelle Yeoh, the grand and short round. I don't remember his name.

57:27.760 --> 57:33.520
But yeah, like, I hear he's great in it. Oh, oh my god, that the fact that he's come back from

57:33.520 --> 57:40.000
acting after like 40 years and does that. I mean, people are gonna forget this movie come Oscar

57:40.000 --> 57:45.920
time and I don't put a lot of stock into awards. I hope not. It is it is our responsibility as the

57:45.920 --> 57:52.960
internet internet rally around me. It is our responsibility as the internet period. A

57:52.960 --> 57:58.880
corporation. Al Gore's internet is our responsibility. That the Academy does not forget

57:58.880 --> 58:04.800
about this movie come next Oscar season. And if Michelle Yeoh doesn't get nominated,

58:06.400 --> 58:09.920
I was gonna make a slap joke, but then I realized I'll be in bad taste. So I'm not gonna make it.

58:09.920 --> 58:14.080
All right, let's move on. Loki, you have another story for us.

58:14.880 --> 58:25.440
Yes. So Game Freak is implementing an optional four day workweek, which sounds amazing. So

58:25.440 --> 58:31.760
they're giving employees an extra day off of the week for the purpose of childcare or family care.

58:31.760 --> 58:36.880
And they're it's able to be done on a monthly basis to have like a flexible work environment,

58:36.880 --> 58:46.720
they said, where needed. But it does come with a 20% pay cut. So if it's a four day workweek,

58:47.520 --> 58:51.120
and you're not working an extra day, so there's not paying you for that paying you for that day.

58:51.120 --> 58:54.640
Exactly. Yes. So that is a bit misleading.

58:57.280 --> 59:00.480
That's just more. That's not paid time off either. That's

59:00.480 --> 59:05.200
yeah, that's just that's just you can work only four days and we'll give you four fifth salary

59:05.200 --> 59:12.720
for doing that. But I mean, you have an option. At least they have benefits.

59:12.720 --> 59:17.280
Yeah, there are some people, you know, as much as we're kind of staring at this and

59:17.280 --> 59:22.880
blinking right now. There are people where this would fit very well into their life.

59:22.880 --> 59:28.320
And you know, it's like, oh, I could hold down a full time job and benefits and so forth. But also

59:28.320 --> 59:34.160
have that extra day for the bandwidth, I need to, you know, take care of kids, go to school,

59:34.160 --> 59:38.720
whatever it is, you know, everybody's life. And it's optional. So at least they have an

59:38.720 --> 59:43.920
option to do that. And you know, it's you have just have to weigh it. But at the very least,

59:44.080 --> 59:48.320
like if it were in the United States, and they were not paying you for that extra day,

59:49.200 --> 59:52.480
they would probably take away your benefits as well. Because you're not a full time employee

59:52.480 --> 59:57.680
at that point. You know, like, that's the kind of shitty things that US employers do. So

59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.400
cool. Like to see them do that.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:07.040
SSU 100. Matt says I do know places and friends who work at places where they have for

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:12.000
10 hour days. Yeah, I do. Actually, my Yeah, my day job company has this option as well.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:18.000
First, most positions, sometimes the position doesn't kind of let you do that. But for most

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.520
positions, you can do that. But yeah, and for the work at home, especially where you're not

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.800
commuting. I think that works very well for a lot of people.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:35.440
I would totally do that. But unfortunately, I'm your salary. So for my for 10 hour days,

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.880
and then another eight hour day, it's still paid the same. So it's like,

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.360
yeah, unfortunately, you can't do that. But that was an option. I know back when I was in our

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.960
customer service center, when we were in the call center, the EU could do for 10s if you wanted to.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.360
I just couldn't swing that either.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.960
Yeah. So again, sometimes with schedule, like, you know, you have kids, it's harder to work 10

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.040
hour days when you have to get your kid from school and those those sorts of needs. That's

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:07.920
harder to do. So you know, it just depends on your life situation. So but it's nice to see employers

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:16.800
have that flexibility. And I think that is a huge thing that the pandemic. Good employers have

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.680
responded to the pandemic with more flexibility. Good ones have and they'll they'll persevere for

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:28.880
that. Anyhow, let's move on. We were talking about PlayStation Plus a little bit ago.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:34.880
Let's talk about those game trials. Because again, part of the perks for PlayStation Plus is that

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.760
you're supposed to get free game trials up to like a certain, I think two hours in or something

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:45.280
like that to really get a robust taste of the game. And there was some reporting going around

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:51.520
on social media that Sony is asking developers to create time limited trials for games for the new

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:59.040
PlayStation Plus premium service. But now it's coming out from Ethan Gack at Kotaku that actually

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:04.080
the PlayStation store team is going to take this on and set up the trials for the developers. So

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:10.720
it's interesting how that rumor led to this kind of shifting course here. But in a tweet, Ethan

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:17.680
says sources tell me, of course, a good old source, which means that somebody inside Sony that just

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.880
doesn't want to get in trouble. PlayStation store team will create the two hour time trials for

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:28.160
developers. So it shouldn't be extra work, though I've heard concerns from others about Sony

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.840
monetizing a perk and not sharing that revenue with studios. That's an interesting side effect

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:39.440
is that you know, there might be people that play the two hour demo and decide not to get the game.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:45.200
And the publisher doesn't get anything from that, even though Sony did. Well, demos,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.560
I would assume this is gonna work just like the trials work with I think. I think it was EA that

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:57.680
was, you know, actually, not that they mentioned the trials and stuff. Wasn't it Sony that was

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.880
doing that? I thought they were already doing trials for full games. Or maybe I'm thinking EA

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.360
or something like that through their like EA thinking early accessing, you're thinking of

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:12.400
EA through their EA player, whatever it's called. Yeah, I swear to God, though, there was something

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:18.880
outside of EA that was doing full, they were doing like, trials for like, full games or something

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.520
like that. Well, steam, if you want to, I mean, it's not really a trial, but they do the refund

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:30.880
within two hours. And some people abuse that as a trial. Well, no, not not like that. But like,

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:42.960
I want to say like, gosh, was it? PlayStation was through PlayStation Plus, actually, they had full

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:48.400
game trials, this is a great way to try before you buy, play a game for up to one hour or and

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.240
then purchase the game to unlock trophies and continue your progress. So this is something

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.320
they already had. This is not a new thing. They had it on PlayStation four. Interesting,

01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:00.720
but now it's going up to two hours. And it's only going to be in PlayStation premium.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.120
That's interesting.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:08.640
Whoo, we we changed the one to a two and then we charged you for it.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:14.080
That's that that that does on beyond that does track with Sony. Remember when playing online was

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:21.360
free? That's some that's some Yuji Naka level tweaking, you know, services there, you know.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.760
Next story.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.120
So you want to hear something scary? They're going to be making a Poppy Playtime movie.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.760
No, that's pretty cool. No, I'm totally I would totally watch that. It's awesome. But yeah,

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:44.320
so Poppy Playtime, if you're not aware, is a indie survival horror video game that involves a

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:53.120
toy factory with, you know, fun creatures like Fuzzy Wuzzy or Huggy Wuggy or something like that.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:01.280
I don't remember his name, but yes, so horror game with giant like puppets and stuff like that.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:08.560
But it is being developed by Studio 71, who, if you're not familiar with that name, they did the

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:15.520
VHS series. It was like a bunch of kind of I don't know if it was like a horror anthology

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.640
or something like that. But I remember it had to do with like people finding VHS

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:26.640
tapes with like horrible things on it. So of course, you know, the company Mob Games

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.800
that develops the game is said that they could have never imagined that this game be so popular

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:37.920
as it is. And they're beyond excited to work with Studio 71 to transform Poppy into a feature film.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:46.240
So I am excited. It's going to be scary. It is going to be damn scary. But like,

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:53.040
I want to see that. And also whatever happened to the stupid FNAF movie? Like,

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:58.080
is that ever going to happen? I'm so disappointed. Have you seen this? I got a

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.800
there's this post going around Facebook. Hold on. Okay. I didn't want to show the name of the

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:09.360
person. But I got I got it from the I'll show the name of the sheriff's office that shared it

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:13.840
because this is this is wild. Do you want to see this latest thing going around Facebook as I saw?

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:19.360
Because I used to at my old job, I used to work with some Karen's so I still follow some on

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.960
Facebook. And one of them posted this. So it's from Okay, hold on. Let's show this here. How do I

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.440
let me do? Hold on. Sorry, bear with me because I'm doing it live.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:36.640
There. Okay. Attention parents. The county sheriff's office looked at the origins of a

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.640
controversy about a character named Huggy Wuggy from a survival horror video game called poppy

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:45.280
playtime. This is a survival horror video game developed and published by American indie developer

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:51.440
mob games, etc, etc, etc. They're issuing a warning to parents due to a series of videos

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.320
surrounding Huggy Wuggy. The warnings are due to the characters initially child friendly videos,

01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:01.200
which very quickly turned nightmarish. The concerning videos are fan made,

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.520
produced by someone who admires a particular TV show, film or video game. Here are some of the

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.240
YouTube channels that made the concerning videos and there's a list there. The videos include

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:15.440
offensive language, cartoon representations of alcohol use, blood stabbings, decapitations,

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.080
attempted murder, murder and the bloody aftermath of a car crash. And one of the videos a toy

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.880
cartoon character tells a cartoon person, my hugs don't hurt one bit, you'll be dead before

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.280
the pain comes. The character then hugs and squeezes the person until they turn blue and

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:40.000
passes out. What? Why? Why are the police warning people about YouTube content is what I want to

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.720
know. That's what struck me as like wild. When I saw that Facebook post, I was like, wait, is this

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:52.880
is this actually poppy playtime or no, this is like YouTube people using poppy poppy playtime.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:58.560
This is getting into the whole Elsa Spider-Man nonsense that the like the dark side of like

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:03.920
YouTube, like bot farms and stuff like that to create these weird like procedure, not even

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:08.560
procedurally generated, it's just like, just garbage stuff that children will click on.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:14.480
And yeah, there's probably a lot of fan videos and stuff about poppy playtime and stuff because

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:23.360
because that's the thing. But I don't understand why the police need to be involved with this as

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:28.560
far as like, warning people in true video game fashion, or I'm sorry, in true Facebook fashion.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.600
Can I go to this comment here? Yeah, first of all, the LCSD should be ashamed of itself for

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:39.360
this fear mongering anti video game post. Not all video games are for kids. Those still stuck in the

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.440
video games are toys for children mindset have no one to blame for themselves. If their children

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:51.360
are exposed to content they deem inappropriate 59 replies and I hesitate to think what they're

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:56.560
all gonna be positive anyway, I'm sure parents watch what your kids are consuming. That's the

01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:07.920
bottom line here, right? All right. Sorry, I had to bring that up. I just when I saw that on

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.720
Facebook, I was like, what in the what is this world? Then I hope their kids get taken to the

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.560
movies to go see poppy playtime. The wonderful like, it's like the Muppets.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.480
SSG 100. Matt says, Oh, God reading the comments live. Yeah, sometimes sometimes what does this

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.760
show become? Oh, I'm sure the movie can be rated R and kids will still show up anyway. Come on,

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.640
you go to any R rated movie these days. You go to you go to Mortal Kombat in the theaters and

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.480
people are like, Oh, whatever. I'm taking my kid because you know, it's a video game.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:43.440
I saw this, I saw a video online about this theater chain that literally has

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.840
Emma assuming these are special theaters for like, kids movies and stuff, but they literally have

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:54.320
like, one of those play structures in the movie theater itself. It's like a McDonald's new play

01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:00.960
structure thing with like movies and like actual kids movies and stuff. Tell me where I'm going

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:06.000
without telling me where I'm never going. I mean, I'm assuming it's for like special

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.760
like kids movies only but it'd be funny though they play poppy playtime that I prefer the reverse

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:16.320
of that like I don't know if they still do this but the kabuki kabuki theater in San Francisco

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:21.360
has several screens where since they sell alcohol, it's 21 and up only that is my favorite place to

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:29.280
see a movie. Yeah, that's I think they do that over here locally at our they call it the plaudio

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:34.800
Lux thing but they do have I think certainly screen times where it may serve alcohol time but

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:41.520
they have I think they do have certain it's a separate theater it's like right around the

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.080
corner of the regular patio but those are the ones where you have like the fancy like you can order

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:52.160
food and alcohol and stuff if you want and they have a bar but SSJ 100 Matt says I snuck into

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.440
barbed wire when I was 13. Wasn't that that Pamela Anderson movie? That movie is terrible.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.960
Yeah, but you know what? There's there's a lot in that movie for a 13 year old boy.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:12.240
At least y'all maybe maybe not all boys because I don't think that movie did anything for me but

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:18.240
some of y'all I'm sure really enjoyed that film despite the fact it was terrible. All right.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:23.600
Anyhow, let's move on. Loki, why don't you tell us the most unsurprising news of the year?

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.720
There's gonna be a new Call of Duty what Activision making the game that makes the money

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:38.320
what so shocking. So they've announced that the new game they're putting out is Modern Warfare 2

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:43.200
and you may be thinking, well, wait a second there. I swear I remember there being a Modern

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:48.000
Warfare 2 before. In fact, I'm pretty sure there's a Modern Warfare 3. Well, this is the new Modern

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.040
Warfare 2, which is actually like Call of Duty 17 or something like that. I'm not really sure what

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.920
number that they're on now, but yeah, they're doing it's the sequel to the Modern Warfare

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:06.320
1 reboot thing. So it's a reboot sequel. Yeah, number 10 in the Modern Warfare series.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.120
Do you own them all, Loki?

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.680
I own like the first three.

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:22.480
Technically, like, there's one, two and three. And then reflex was on the Wii, I think. And

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.360
then there's mobile games. There's the remasters. I don't have the remasters. And then I don't have

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.400
the new. I may have the new Modern Warfare because that may have been a PlayStation plus title at one

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:39.520
time. I may actually own all of them. I don't know, except for the mobile and the Wii version.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.120
I wouldn't buy the Wii version.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.960
Darktitsia in chat says maybe they should just put the year on it like Madden does.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.440
Call of Duty 22. Would you play that?

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:54.240
I like the Modern Warfare games, honestly. I don't know how the last reboot thing was,

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.800
but like the first three Modern Warfare games were pretty good. I really like the first three

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:05.040
ones. But that's that's Activision of like the way past when it wasn't super terrible. Like the

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:10.880
games are good and they didn't have a loot boxes and stuff. But we're never going back to those

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.560
days again. Unfortunately.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.040
E3VL in chat says can't put the year. They'll think it's based on Ukraine Russia war. Oof.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.480
But I mean, kind of true. I mean, yeah, yeah, there are people types of conclusions.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.400
And then there's another fun thing. So with Call of Duty Vanguard, they've added a new anti cheat

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:36.240
tool that now allows them to basically detect when they're doing the cheating. And they have

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:42.080
a new mitigation technique called cloaking that will make everybody but the cheater invisible.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:49.440
So if they catch you wall hacking, you're going to be wall hacking ghosts, I guess.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:55.600
The ways they trap and screw over cheat. Well, I mean, I wouldn't call it screwing over cheaters

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:59.600
because cheaters deserve it. But, you know, the pranks, I don't know, the punks they're playing

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.800
on cheaters are getting funnier and funnier. Devs are more and more clever with how they do that.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.720
I always like the cheater island where you just put the cheater in games with other cheaters and

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.760
let them Yeah, that was granted thought of online, they used to do that. And people

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:17.040
just didn't really care. Like, oh, well, you know, well, right. That's,

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.280
and a lot of times you get put there for stupid things. I think some people like

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:27.680
being on cheater Island, quite frankly. So yeah, yeah. So well, you know, this is

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:35.360
it's not that ridiculous. You know, at least they're doing something unlike, you know, what

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:41.840
they're doing with what Blizzard is doing with Overwatch two, which is basically nothing.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:52.880
Well, moving on to another story is that there's now 91 games that you can no longer play online.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:57.200
Now, I do want to make sure there's kind of two important parts of the story because one of the

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:02.880
headlines that's going around is that Ubisoft is going to be shutting down services for 91 games.

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:09.040
But here's what's actually happened is that there was a blog post with a timestamp that was wrong

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:14.240
on it that said there's a list of 91 games have now been shut down. So it made it look like all

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.200
these games were shut down at once. But Ubisoft actually apologized for the confusion saying,

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:26.400
these are games that have all ended online services over the last year. So it is not 91

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:31.440
games that they shut down all at once. These are 91 games that have been actually shut down over

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.800
the last year. Most people probably just haven't talked about, yeah, it's a lot, but most people

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:42.000
probably haven't talked about it because most people probably didn't even notice. I mean,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:49.760
there's games that are on this list that are on the Xbox 360, Far Cry Blood Dragon on PS3, Xbox 360

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:56.240
and PC, no longer playable online, but there's games on here for the Wii. How about Just Dance

01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:02.400
3 Kids? I know I'm sure you're all beat up about that. But Just Dance 3 Kids is no longer playable

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:08.080
online. But there are some relatively newer games like that Far Cry Blood Dragon was released in

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:14.480
2020, I think, right? That game was awesome. Yeah. So Blood Dragon was not released in 2020.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:20.320
You're right. I'm mixing it up. That's the date that it was actually retired.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.800
Yeah, Blood Dragon came out a while ago, but that game is fantastic.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:30.320
That is like one of the best spin offs of Far Cry game ever.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:35.600
Yeah. I'm trying to see some games in here that are definitely taken down a bit more recently.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:44.880
Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Rainbow Six Vegas, Rainbow Six Lockdown. So anyway, it's just part of the

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:50.320
natural ebb and flow of the cycle of video games is that online servers, they get shut down,

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:56.400
especially if no one's on there playing them. So perhaps we need to go back to a simpler time

01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:03.680
when there were no video games servers online. So you could just keep playing games forever.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.480
So let's get to this segment.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:21.040
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:26.000
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:33.520
Well, and as we discussed earlier in the show, Dark Sakura is not here tonight. So I'm picking

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:38.320
tonight's classic game, which I have picked Ultima. And I'm sorry, Loki. I would have let

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.760
you pick this time, but I didn't have a lot of notice. So I just had to throw something together.

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:47.760
So I had to think like, all right, what haven't I done yet? That's a game that I have a lot of

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:54.000
feelings. I could just talk about this game very easily for a little bit. And I came up on Ultima

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.280
4 Quest of the Avatar. So I've talked a little bit about Ultima 3. I think, you know, years ago,

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.920
I picked that as a classic game. But I want to talk a little bit about Ultima 4, because Ultima

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:12.880
4 is like, the whole Ultima series in general is really an RPG series that gave us a lot that it

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:19.440
often doesn't get credited enough for. Because Ultima 4, I mean, and the original Ultima series

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.320
was of course by Richard Garriott, Lord British on the PC and DOS based systems. Apple, I think

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:29.840
may have been where those games first started. They got ported everywhere. But a lot of modern

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:36.640
RPGs have a lot from Ultima to thank. And you'll notice that I'm actually playing Ultima 4,

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.080
the video here tonight and the music I think you're hearing on stream, I think it's coming

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:45.840
through, is coming from the NES version of the game. Because this is where I remember playing

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:50.320
Ultima 4 for the first time. It might surprise you, I did not play this on the Commodore 64 at

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:56.000
first or any of that stuff. But I actually originally played this on the NES. I want

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.360
to show you real quick, pardon the live screenshot switching here, but I want to show you real quick

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:08.160
what this looks like on the PC because it was a very, very different looking game on the PC.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.880
You know, this, it looked a lot more like a traditional role playing game might look,

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:18.800
where you're actually having to input things and try to get, you know, the characters to

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.600
interact with you by typing things. You actually see your character moving north, south, east and

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:30.800
west. But a lot of this was changed for the NES. So it's just interesting that it is the same game

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:36.560
essentially, but they did a lot to really streamline a lot of the stuff that might feel

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:42.080
a little bit micromanagy in the game otherwise. So let me flip back here. I'm going to flip back

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:47.040
to the NES version because quite honestly, I think it has a better soundtrack. Oops,

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.600
sorry, sorry. Now I'm overlaying both games. That's what happens when I have to do it all

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:57.760
myself live. Okay, let's get into the weeds a little more on Ultima IV. It was released

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:03.440
in 1985, originally for the Apple II. It's considered part of the Age of Enlightenment

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:12.480
trilogy. So the interesting thing about Ultima IV, it's the first RPG in quite some time.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:18.720
You're not trying to overcome a tangible Ultima evil. You're not trying to beat chaos.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:26.800
You're not trying to defeat Lord Evil Doer. You know, this is a very different setup in this game.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:32.640
So basically the way this is all put together is that the Triad of Evil from the previous Ultima

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:38.960
games changed the world of Sosaria. So some of the world disappeared. There were new continents.

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:42.400
It's just basically a way for them to come up with a new map for Sosaria, basically.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:50.080
Lord British, who, you know, is kind of tongue in cheek, a representation of Richard Garriott

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:55.360
in the games, but he's the actual Lord over Britannia. He felt that people lacked purpose

01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:00.880
after the struggles against the Triad were over and he was concerned with spiritual well-being.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:06.480
So he proclaimed the quest of the Avatar. He needed someone to come forward and be the

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:11.600
shining example for others to follow. And that's what this game is, is your ultimate quest of

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:16.800
enlightenment, the quest of the Avatar. So you don't really, like, you're not against like,

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:21.040
oh, we've got this big bad we've got to do. So that's kind of interesting, I think.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:26.320
Also in the beginning of the game, and a lot of people know this from the beginning of the game,

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:32.880
you're asked a series of questions that ultimately determine how your principles of truth,

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:38.080
love, and courage come together to choose what you're going to play in the game. I'm

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:42.960
going to rewind the stream here a little bit so you can see it again. But this first section of

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:48.720
the game is actually asking you questions about how you would respond in certain scenarios

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.320
that ultimately determine the class that you're going to play. So for example,

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:59.040
we're going to, let me get the next question here. Fighting it, oh, sorry, this person's

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:02.160
speed running it so it's like flying by. Let me try to get one of these questions.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.920
Listen carefully. Entrusted to deliver an uncounted purse of gold, thou dost meet a

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.800
poor beggar. Dost thou deliver the gold knowing the trust in thee was well placed, or show

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:17.680
compassion, giving the beggar a coin, knowing it shan't be missed? So you're basically taking a

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:23.520
personality quest at the beginning of the game. And so in this scenario, do you A, honestly give

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:29.760
the money back, or B, show compassion and give the beggar a coin? So based on your answer here,

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:35.360
you're going to tilt the scales to either A, honesty, truth, which is a mage, it's embodied

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:42.800
by the mage in the game, which is pure, pure truth, honesty, or compassion is pure love,

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:48.480
and that is embodied by a bard. So the way you answer these questions, and so the person runs

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:52.880
through all these questions here in the intro and I think they ultimately land on a druid.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:59.840
If I saw that, um, play by quick here. So this person landed on truth and love or justice coming

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:05.840
together. So you can actually have, and there are, there are eight classes. So truth is a mage,

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:12.560
love is a bard, courage is a fighter, truth and love is a druid, love and courage is a, um,

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:20.160
tinkerer, truth and courage is a paladin, truth, love, and courage is considered spirituality,

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:26.240
and that is a ranger. Or you can actually take a challenge in the game and play none,

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:33.440
a character with humility, one that has neither truth, love, nor courage, and that is a shepherd.

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:41.760
Now the character, the classes that you don't end up picking end up being NPCs in the game.

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:45.280
So if I fast forward in the footage here a little more, you'll notice that our druid

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:48.480
has put together a party here where it looks like I think they have the fighter,

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:52.400
and I think that's the ranger that they put together in their party there. So those

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:58.000
characters exist as NPCs and you put together a party of four people by going around the world

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.640
and completing quests and putting your party together to, you know, help you on your quest

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:07.440
to become the avatar. So I think it's really neat, like it's just, it's kind of a neat way

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:13.280
of building the game, like asking like, you know, your character being reflected by a personality

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:18.480
quest or a personality test, I think is really neat, and just how it impacts the ultimate game

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:26.000
and potentially its difficulty. So how did this game come about? Well, Richard Garriott got no

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.280
feedback because California Pacific Computer and Sierra Online never forwarded him mail.

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:39.360
So he finally realized from letters from enraged parents that in the earlier games,

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:45.360
doing immoral actions like stealing and murdering peaceful citizens might be things that people

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:51.200
would find objectionable. So Richard Garriott took on the task of wanting to be a good storyteller,

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:57.120
but a story that has content, and realized that 90% of games out there were just go kill the bad

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:03.440
guy. So Ultima IV ended up being a game about ethical overtones and ended up being a better

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:09.840
told story. In his official biography, it was said he decided that if people were going to

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.720
look for hidden meaning in his work when they didn't even exist, he would introduce ideas and

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.440
symbols with meaning and significance he deemed worthwhile to give them something they could

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:25.200
really think about. So the way this is all set up with a personality test and everything,

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:29.920
you're supposed to imagine that you're playing yourself in the fantasy realm and not a separate

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.360
person, and that was kind of something a little unique for this game at the time as well.

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:41.040
And he removed elements like playing a non-human because he worried that this would prevent players

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:45.840
from identifying personally with their character. So I think that's very, very interesting.

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:53.200
The ankh is oftentimes used as the symbol of the avatar, and Richard Garriott saw this originally

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.000
in the film Logan's Run and decided to use this in his game, and that ankh kind of became a symbol

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:04.480
for Ultima later on. This game came out on the Apple II, the Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit platforms,

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:11.760
a PC-DOS version, the Amiga and the Atari ST, the NES. It was on the Sega Master System, actually.

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:17.280
I always forget that the Ultima IV was on the Sega Master System. And I think, if I remember right,

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:25.840
sorry while I'm doing this live, but sometimes I do it that way, I want to say that the Sega

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.880
Master System, okay, we're going to look at somebody who's actually speedrunning the game.

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.200
I want to say, yeah, it looked more like the PC version. It didn't look like the NES version.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:39.200
The NES version was done with completely redone graphics and things like that, and I want to say

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:45.120
the same team that did Ultima III did that. But it's interesting to see Ultima IV, I think,

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:52.800
on a console but more like the PC version. Oh, kind of interesting. Anyway, the reception for

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.520
this game, believe it or not, and it's interesting because ZenMonkey11 in chat says this game seems

01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:04.560
confusing. I think it is. It may not have held up well over time because games have generally

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:09.680
gotten easier and so forth, just in that, you know, you don't have to manually type to a

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:17.280
character what you want to do anymore. But what this game did for the genre, people consider this

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:22.000
one of the best games ever made, if you can believe it. And I do, I do. I think, you know,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.680
a lot of times games like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest get credited for the genre. But I think

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:33.280
Ultima IV especially did a ton of stuff for the role-playing genre. And I think there's a lot

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:38.720
that we see in games today, especially things like, I would say, the Elder Scrolls series,

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.920
which also lets you kind of embody yourself in the main character that has Ultima IV to thank for it.

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:51.520
Computer Gaming World named Ultima IV as the game of the year in 1986.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:58.480
In 1986, Dragon Magazine called Ultima IV the most impressive and complex adventure to date.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:04.000
Famitsu reviewed the Famicom version of the game and only gave it a 31,

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.560
but the Sega Master System of the game got an 89% in computer and video games.

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:16.320
The co-creator of D&D, Dave Arntzen, said in 1988, Ultima IV and a few other games

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:21.760
have stood pretty much alone as quirks instead of trendsetters in the computer RPG industry,

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:26.320
as other games do not follow their innovations. And I think there was another one here.

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:35.120
Yeah, in 1996, Computer Gaming World named this game the second best video game of all time.

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.960
So, interesting. I'm sorry, did I not say Famitsu out of 40? Yeah, 31 out of 40. I'm sorry if I

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:46.720
was reading fast and trying to multitask here, so lots going on. But anyway, that's a little insight

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:53.760
to Ultima IV, Quest of the Avatar. And I know I played this game quite a bit. It was a hard game.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:59.120
The battle systems, I found to be kind of hard. I would really like to go back and revisit this

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.840
game someday as, like, not a kid, because I bet there would be more in the game I would

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.960
understand that maybe I didn't understand as well before when I first played this game.

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:13.680
But yeah, I think this game is really, it was really transformative for RPGs, especially

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:21.040
on these shores and deserves a lot of credit. Questbuster in chat says Ultima IV was big for

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:25.840
a number of reasons, but probably it was because of its focus on self-improvement as opposed to

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:30.720
just go kill the big evil that really shook things up, as Rob pointed out. Well, thank you.

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:36.960
And there it is, the classic game of the week, Ultima IV, Quest of the Avatar.

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:42.240
Nice. All right. You ever played that game, Loki?

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:47.840
I have not. I actually don't think I've really played any of the Ultima games, except for,

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:53.360
briefly, Ultima Online was at a friend's house, and we were just being obnoxious children.

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:58.480
Yeah, there's nine games. Well, if you don't count online, there's nine games in the Ultima series,

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:02.560
if I remember right, because what pagan was eight, and I think there was one after that.

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:07.920
So, and they're basically, they are a trilogy of trilogies. And as I kind of referenced there,

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:12.640
one, two, and three were its own trilogy where it is go beat the bad guy. But then four, five,

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.600
and six kind of started this journey of enlightenment sort of series. And then seven,

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:21.440
eight, nine, I don't remember exactly. I kind of lost track of the series at that point,

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:28.800
but they were their own trilogy of things. So, yeah. Anyway, it's really a game worth visiting.

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:35.120
And I think especially the NES versions of the Ultima games are really overlooked by time,

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.760
because they are so radically different from the computer versions, which are the ones that are

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:45.520
credited for being so revolutionary. But the soundtracks to both those games too are really

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:50.880
good. I talk about Ultima III a lot. I remember the music in Ultima III very well. It is such a

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:57.600
good soundtrack, but those games haven't really held up in gaming people's memory quite as well.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:02.400
I would love to see those games in a compilation someday. Those are the games for me I would love

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:06.640
to see on the Switch online, but I realized the rights issues gets complicated and so where they

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:12.880
got to convince Richard Garriott it's a good idea, I suppose. So, yeah. All right. Let's check

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:17.600
out some other headlines in a segment we call Rapid Fire News. And you got a few things tonight

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:22.800
for us, Loki. Yeah. So, Bethesda, because you know they are getting rid of their dedicated

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:27.280
launcher, they are going to be putting their games on Steam. And so, as part of that, they

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:33.120
have added five of their classic games to Steam, and some of which are actually free at the moment.

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:39.600
So, Elder Scrolls, you get the Elder Scrolls Arena, Elder Scrolls II Daggerfall, the Elder

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:45.600
Scrolls Adventures Redguard, and Elder Scrolls Legend Battlespire and Wolfenstein Enemy Territory.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:52.480
Elder Scrolls Arena and Daggerfall are free. And also, apparently, Wolfenstein Enemy Territory is

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.760
zero dollars right now. I'm not sure that's going to stay that way, but go.

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.480
I grabbed the two, I forgot about the Wolfenstein game, so I got to go grab that too. But the two,

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:10.800
yeah, I grabbed those today. And just a reminder, you can now transfer your Bethesda launcher titles

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:14.880
over to Steam. When this was first reported on a couple months ago, that wasn't available yet,

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:20.320
but that is available now. And so, I actually had all three Quake games, because Bethesda gave

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:25.040
them away for free if you downloaded the launcher during QuakeCon at some point. So, now I have all

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:30.400
those games on Steam. So, just kind of fun. So, you can transfer that all over today. It's pretty

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:34.880
easy. You just link your Bethesda account to your Steam account, and then you push a button and

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:37.680
wait, basically. Yeah, I got to go do that.

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:43.760
Yeah. You have to, I mean, I don't think you can ever not do it, but you might have a lapse when

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:48.720
the Bethesda launcher goes away to play the game if you don't go move them over. So, you might as

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:51.440
well go ahead and do it. And grab the free games while you're at it. They're free.

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:58.000
Sure. The Super Mario Brothers animated movie, which is supposed to come to theaters this

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:04.560
Christmas, is now going to be delayed to April 2023. So, that was put out by a tweet from

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:10.800
Nintendo, or I guess Miyamoto, because it says this is Miyamoto. But yes, it's now been delayed

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:20.400
to April 7th and April 28th in Japan. So, oh, well, we'll just wait longer, I guess.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.120
All right, whatever.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:22.240
Yeah.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:26.720
Fifth Dream in chat says, Christmas canceled by Nintendo. You know what,

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:33.600
though? Here's something to consider. The theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.360
is going to open around that same timeframe. It's not opening this holiday. It's opening

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.640
spring 2023.

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:56.080
Apparently, BBC Proms is celebrating classical and orchestral music every year. They have live

01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:03.120
concerts and they're going to be showcasing, for the first time, video game music this summer.

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:09.600
So, on August 1st, they're going to have gaming prom from 8Bit to Infinity,

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:15.360
which will be performed at the Royal Albert Hall in London and conducted by Robert Ames.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.960
That's awesome. Yeah, Jason referenced that in the intro a little bit. And I hope there's a way

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:24.800
for us to watch it over here, that the content gets on YouTube and isn't region locked or

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:29.440
something. I'd love to see it. I think it'd be pretty great. Just coming off a couple of weeks

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:35.280
ago, seeing the San Francisco Symphony doing the Dear Friends, but the other Final Fantasy concert,

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:41.840
whatever they're calling it now. Distant Worlds, that was it. It's great to see the symphonies

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:45.920
performing the video game music. Again, it's art. It's a part of our culture. It's what we've grown

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:54.240
up on. Yeah. And then if you are interested in getting some more Animal Crossing music,

01:34:54.240 --> 01:35:02.320
Animal Crossing New Horizons has the original Soundtrack 2 coming out on CD here. Also,

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:09.120
there is going to be a KK Slider vinyl album that's been released or revealed, I guess.

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:18.480
The Soundtrack 2 is set to release in Japan June 22nd and priced at 7,480 yen and apparently

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:27.440
includes 140 tracks across five CDs. And then of course, the vinyl album, which is supposed to be

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:39.200
released November 23rd and priced at 4,620 yen and has 19 songs in all. So 18 KK Slider music

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:44.880
instrumental collection and one bonus track. I wonder if Dark Sakura, I know she loves her KK

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.320
Slider songs. I wonder if she's going to get that vinyl. It seems like something that's up around.

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:53.840
Maybe. I'll have to ask her next week. All right. Well, now let's see what else we can buy this week

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:58.320
as we travel around the world and check out some release dates. So, Loki, what's coming out in the

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:06.320
US this week? In the US, we have Citizen Sleeper on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:15.680
Trek the Yomi on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. And honestly, that's it.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:22.480
Sure. Well, probably part of the reason it's quiet over here is that it's very quiet over

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:26.720
in Japan this week, because if I'm not mistaken, it's Golden Week in Japan, because I've seen some

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:31.280
of the sales starting on the stores in honor of Golden Week. And looking at the release dates,

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:34.960
there is nothing. There's some accessories coming out this week. We don't really talk about those a

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:39.120
lot. There are no games coming out this week in Japan. We don't really get to anything until May

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:45.520
12th on the Switch. When Dead by Daylight gets a release in Japan on the Switch, I think it's a new

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:51.280
compilation on the 12th. But as far as this week goes, nothing in Japan. So play what you already

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:55.600
got. Get caught up in your backlog. How about the UK, Loki? I imagine it's pretty slow.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:00.320
The UK, they're just getting Sifu on PlayStation.

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:07.360
So all right. So a holiday week in Japan kind of slows down the gaming industry around the world.

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:11.440
But it's understandable, especially with a lot of games. Well, a lot of games from April. Yeah,

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:17.680
April, May is usually pretty dead anyway. So it's not not surprised. It is. Just because at this

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:22.240
point, companies are going to hold their games until school's out. And we have well to play

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:27.520
through games. So yeah, typically a lot of the stuff gets held until it used to be like June

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:34.080
would be kind of a little bit of a release window and then dead for July for sure. July is like an

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:39.200
absolute dead month. August is kind of like let's jump into the fourth quarter in the third quarter.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:45.040
And then it just ramps up from there until December. All right. We have a few more stories

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.000
for you. And then we're going to take your calls and your emails and your other participation in

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.640
our listener roundtable. If you want to give us a call, join our discord. You can also talk with us

01:37:54.640 --> 01:38:00.000
throughout the week on discord over at vog network.com. That's vognetwork.com slash discord.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.120
If you want to call into the show, you want to head on over to the green room and we will be

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:07.520
pulling people in. But we'll get to that a little later. For now we have some headlines. Loki.

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.960
Yeah, let's talk about Twitch. The Twitch is looking to make some more money because they

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:18.960
apparently they are not making enough money. So they are considering some major changes to their

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:24.960
monetization practices, none of which actually benefit the streamers, unfortunately. So right

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:34.000
now, Twitch is looking to propose a cut to, I guess, certain partnered streamers from normally,

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:40.800
I guess they get 70% of the revenue from Twitch subscriptions. It's going to be dropped down to

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:48.640
50%, which is what affiliates make. Also, they're going to be doing some things to

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:57.840
um, I don't know if it's incentivize more ads to be played. Not really sure what that necessarily

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:06.880
means. And they're going to have a new tier system for partnered streamers as well. So yeah,

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:12.080
I don't know a lot of stuff is contractual stuff that I don't have anything to really do. Yeah,

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:18.320
so incentives for more ads, no more exclusivity, which I guess is all right. So no longer will they

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:22.000
force you to only stream on Twitch, you can actually stream on other platforms.

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:29.680
Let's be real, there are a lot of we're very good, you know, folks here at VOG, where we don't,

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:36.640
you know, put this show up on YouTube immediately after it's broadcast here on Twitch. But there's

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.600
a lot of people that do things like that. And they're just like, well, you know, it's what

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:45.360
Twitch isn't going to find out. And Twitch never does find out. But technically, you are in

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.640
violation of your contract. So maybe, you know, Twitch realizes they can't enforce this. So why

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:59.920
not make it a perk? Yeah, so I don't know. It's just, it kind of sucks that they're going to be

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:04.960
doing a lot of stuff. And of course, it's not been taken positive at all by anybody, I think

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:09.440
it's because it's literally taking away people's income. But but you know, what are you going to

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.880
do? Because it's, you know, something's got to give if Twitch doesn't make money, then the

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:20.880
platform disappears. And then people are up shit Creek. Oh, yes. Because Amazon doesn't make enough

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:26.160
money. My well, my advice to full time streamers is you better have a plan for if Twitch closes

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:32.000
tomorrow. Like that's my honest advice. You better have a plan for if Twitch closes tomorrow.

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.680
What are you gonna do? I don't even know here at VOG network, what do we do? I have an idea what we

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:44.880
do. But uh, you know, there's, there's pretty easy, you just do it on YouTube, or it always

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:49.920
go back to doing it on shoutcast. So but I don't know, I don't know, we don't really have an answer

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:54.880
yet. But you need to, you know, if but we also don't make a lot of money off this we don't make,

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:59.280
in fact, we doesn't really pay any of our, our personal bills. We don't make any money

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:04.480
personally from this. It pays for VOG to be a legitimate business. And it pays for once in a

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:14.320
while, some nice sponsorships and conventions and things like that. So yeah. Anyway, um, so I,

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:18.080
you know, Twitch is obviously in this situation where they're not making as much money as Amazon,

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:24.960
the big Amazon feels like they should. It's leading this tricky situation, I suppose.

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:32.720
So yeah. We'll see. All right. I wonder if I wonder if they aren't gonna,

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:38.640
I would think they're gonna start to gate up how long it takes to get to affiliate.

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.960
That's my honest advice. If you think you might want to become a Twitch affiliate at some point,

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:49.440
I would really encourage you to start that process sooner rather than later.

01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.400
But let's be honest, though, like, there's there's nothing stopping them from taking affiliate

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:59.280
status away from you. There really isn't look at YouTube. I mean, YouTube, I used to be able to

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:06.160
make ad money off of like my channel. And now it's like, no, yeah, no, totally fair point.

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:15.440
So we'll see what happens. All right. Moving on. Next story. Also look, yes, Disney is or I should

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:23.200
say Gameloft is releasing a new Disney game called Disney dreamlight Valley, which looks kind of like

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:30.320
a cross between Animal Crossing and say like The Sims with like a bunch of Disney stuff thrown in.

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:39.600
It is a free to play game that is going to be on console and PC. And it'll be launching in 2023.

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:45.520
It's all I mean, it looks all right. I know there's some people that probably be into this,

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:52.480
but I get really wary when it's a Gameloft title. And I could just see monetization

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:56.080
out the ass for this. Yeah, it's one of those things where it's like it has the potential

01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:01.360
to be really good. There's a lot of good things in that formula. But it's one of those we really

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:04.960
can't pass judgment on it until we can actually play it because it's one of those things that can

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:10.960
go many directions. It could really be surprising. It could really be a cash cow that just, you know,

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:18.160
leaves cow patties everywhere. So we'll see. Yeah, it looks neat, though, as long as it's

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:24.320
awesome. I would prefer this was more like a Disney Infinity type game. And that's almost

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:30.640
kind of the vibe I got from some of that stuff. But it's a free to play game. Like just make a

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:35.120
console game. Like, why is it so hard that we can't just like, like, honestly, like, imagine

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:39.440
like, if they made just like an Animal Crossing game, just like they can even sell DLC for like

01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:44.400
different things like Oh, hey, you want like, you know, the Nightmare Before Christmas stuff. Now

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.600
we'll send and sell you a Nightmare Before Christmas thing and they could like piecemeal

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:52.800
it out that way. Instead of it being free. I just whatever.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:58.800
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says serious Disney fans are

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:07.760
a different breed and will either love this or be shit on. Yes. Very that. Another story next also

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:16.240
from Loki. So Bungie has unfortunately kind of received a little bit of a loss when it came to

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:24.240
going after cheat sellers. For destiny to they apparently were going after the website aim junkie

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:33.840
saying that they were in violation of copyright infringement. But apparently the judge did not

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:46.080
feel that way. So they have dismissed the claims for the copyright was the non trade, I guess

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:50.960
trademark really claims they've dismissed that they said that the non trademark really claims

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:58.400
should skip the court and be resolved via arbitration. But apparently, though, the aim

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:04.480
junkies I guess and they have the legal team have dismissed the copyright infringement claims saying

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:09.600
that, you know, they haven't actually copied anything. Because they're kind of just like

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:17.120
circumventing their cheat software or something like that. So that means that makes sense that

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.120
they wouldn't get them on that. But I still think in the end, they're probably, you know,

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:25.840
bungees got a lot more money when it comes to lawyers, I would think so they probably gonna

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:29.760
end up getting them on the other stuff. We'll just see what happens on appeal because that's

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:36.240
how these things always go. Right. Exactly. Yeah. All right, stay tuned. Something else you might

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:42.640
want to stay tuned for if you're a roblox player is a performance from Lizzo, who's pretty amazing

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.560
and has a new album coming out. Lizzo is going to be doing a concert in the metaverse on April 30.

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:56.320
I mean, here's the end. This is no disrespect to Lizzo. She's she's great. But this whole thing

01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:00.880
is being hyped up. It's like, oh, it's a concert in the meta. Hasn't Fortnite been doing concerts?

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:08.000
I mean, I know Fortnite isn't technically the metaverse. But isn't it kind of like that? I

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:13.760
don't get it. They've already done concerts before in Roblox too, I want to say. Yeah, it's weird.

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:20.320
Anyway, Logitech is doing Oh, maybe this is it. Logitech says it's the first music award show in

01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:27.600
the metaverse. It's the song breaker awards and Lizzo will be doing her first virtual performance

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:35.120
in this music award show calling it the metaverse. Jesus Christ, it's just a game call it VR chat.

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:39.840
That's what it is. It's like just like it's just like, oh, let's use the buzzword buzzword the

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:45.600
blockchain metaverse pass. Give us money now. Money, money. I'm gonna tell you this much,

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:50.560
you know, you can throw up the word metaverse all you want for Roblox. But like their stock

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:55.920
prices aren't doing as good as they used to like that stuff that launched at like 80 bucks a share

01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:03.200
and it's down to like 50 I think so. Yeah, it ain't sell anybody on the metaverse stuff.

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:07.760
Questbuster says Hatsune Miku concerts have been a thing in PlayStation Home Japan.

01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:15.200
That's pretty cool. No, it's Zen monkey. It's not in VR chat. It's in Roblox. I was just calling it

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:19.920
VR chat because that's what the metaverse is. The metaverse is just VR chat under a different name.

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:25.680
That's all it is. I don't just it's a really bad word that they're gonna beat it to death. Like

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:33.280
it's just like I'm so sick of hearing about metaverse. Like it's just it's so dumb. Yeah.

01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:40.880
All right. Well, that's it for the stories that we had on deck for tonight. So we invite you to

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:45.920
give us a call if you'd like over in our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:52.720
We also have our mailbag, which I will get to here in a moment. While I open up the mailbag,

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:55.600
Loki, is there any other headlines we missed tonight that you want to talk about?

01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:00.560
Not really.

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:06.160
We have one email. So we have something for tonight. We have an email. YYR has been

01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:11.760
emailing us a lot, but I surely don't mind. I always enjoy hearing from YYR. So we have

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:17.600
this email tonight from YYR saying hello, LR. Just a note on something you mentioned in last week's

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:23.360
episode. Sonic Origins will be releasing this month. However, if all you want are the original

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:29.360
games at a reasonable price without the scummy DLC, you should know that the original Xbox 360

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:35.360
versions of Sonic one, two, three and Knuckles, as well as Sonic CD are still currently available for

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:42.000
$5 each via backwards compatibility on Xbox one and series consoles. And if you buy Sonic and

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.200
Knuckles, you can use the lock on feature with any of Sonic one through three if you also purchase

01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:51.840
those. However, if this sounds like a good alternative to you, you probably shouldn't

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:55.920
wait too long to jump on it. This may have been mentioned during the show already. No,

01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:01.280
I was saving it for this actually. I read ahead tonight. But all of those titles are about to be

01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:07.840
delisted on May 20th. Just saying. It just really irritates me that they want to charge so much for

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:12.320
these games now, especially considering that they're also adding the sorts of things we get,

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:18.960
we used to get for free in these collections as paid DLC. Just stop. Anyway, thanks again for the

01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:25.120
show and enjoy your week. Happy to save a buck here and there. Aaron or yyr and I'm going to add

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:31.120
a PS that he didn't write but I'm putting it there. PS by falling plus on Xbox now. It's

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:35.680
available. Oh, I got the number one score and falling was I haven't checked to see if it's

01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:41.280
still there. I should I if anyone dethrone me it was this issue 100 Matt, but I got the number one

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.840
score and falling plus at some point. Oh, do you take it back? All right, Matt took it back. I just

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:55.760
haven't logged in to look at it. So I guess I got to play again. But yeah, so check out falling

01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:00.240
plus on Xbox if you want to get in our pissing match over a high score in that game. But that's

01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:07.440
been fun. Bobby Black Wolf and chat says I had it. You did. You had it for a moment.

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:16.240
As soon as Matt says buy the game and dethrone me please. Yes, dethrone us both. Um, so anyway,

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:22.720
back to the point in Aaron's email about the games being delisted. Yeah. Um, they never did put them

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:29.200
out like I would have thought for sure there was a compilation on CD. But I guess, or DVD or

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:37.920
whatever of those Sonic games. I guess there wasn't. But um, what is that called? I'm looking

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:42.720
up right now. Was it the Sonic mega collection? Well, there's that that's available on GameCube,

01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:49.280
and that has everything. But what was the mega Genesis?

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:54.400
Yeah, it was something like something Genesis collection. I don't remember what it's called.

01:50:54.400 --> 01:51:01.120
Sorry for the silence. But I'm trying to remember what this is called.

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:07.360
Like ultimate Genesis or Sonic. It's just called the Sega Genesis collection. Okay,

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:13.200
that's that's what I'm looking for. Or Sega Genesis classics. So let me look Sega

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:23.360
Genesis classics ps4 game list. So if you pick up this Sega Genesis classics,

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:32.160
on ps4, it has Sonic and Sonic two, it just doesn't have Sonic three.

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:40.960
But it has 3d blast and spinball in it as well. So and I think that I remember it coming up that

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:47.760
maybe the music with Sonic three has been an issue in the past. But yeah. So anyway, also pointing

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:52.320
out the Sonic ultimate Genesis collection didn't have the lock on feature. Oh, is that the one on

01:51:52.320 --> 01:52:02.480
ps3? Sorry, I'm looking up things live as we're going. Okay, yeah, the Sonic ultimate Genesis

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:09.040
collection was the one that was on ps3 and Xbox 360. And that has one, two and three.

01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:18.480
And it has Sonic and Knuckles. So I bet you could find that game used pretty cheap right now until

01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:23.360
people realize it's true value that it has all those Sonic games in it. I think I have this on

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:28.160
PlayStation three hanging out around somewhere. It's a bummer. I can't fucking play PlayStation

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:36.880
three games on my ps4 or PlayStation five. So you can play some of them, but you have to buy

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:41.200
them again. Well, and this one won't be one that you can buy again, I guarantee it why would Sega

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:45.360
put that out when they've got this other Sonic thing they want people to buy now. So I would

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:52.480
the Xbox 360 version of this is really the must have thing I would say. Oh, de drama as says you

01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:56.880
got a PS five No, not yet. I'm speaking out of turn a little bit. It's just that with Final

01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:03.120
Fantasy 16 likely releasing in the next year. It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of you know,

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:08.160
when I finally tell call call Shane and say, Shane, I need you to work your target inventory

01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:15.840
magic and make me get a PS five. So Oh, Bobby Blackwell says it's not backwards compatible on

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:24.880
Xbox one. Oh, sneaky sneaky. So you really just have to have a 360 to play this. Interesting.

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:28.800
Greedy, greedy, greedy.

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:37.040
Aren't I guess I'll just the wide graphic thing really worth that much. And and why no Sonic four

01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:44.800
as if I had to ask. It wasn't good. But why no Sonic for my then why not just throw it in.

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:53.600
Anyway. All right. Uh, that is gonna do it for another episode of orange launch radio. Thank you

01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:59.920
so much for tuning into our show and supporting the show. Whether you were here live over at

01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:04.320
twitch.tv slash a vog network on Sunday night, or you were listening on our podcast three feed

01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:09.600
throughout the week. Thank you so much for supporting our show. As Jonah Matt says the

01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:17.280
Sonic four is a DLC that's going to be another $30. Yeah. And did your MS says retail stores

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:22.960
can get them in stock for 24 hours now. Yeah, I think we've heard rumblings that the chip shortage

01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:29.200
is on its way out. And just most people who wanted a PS five that badly have finally gotten one by

01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:34.160
now. So it's, you know, just don't support the resellers. That's the most important thing.

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:39.440
Anyway, where was I? Yes, if you enjoyed the show, help us spread the word. We are the show where

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:44.160
every gamer has a voice but we need more voices here to put out on air. A nice five star review

01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:48.880
on a site site like iTunes or Spotify or Google, whatever, wherever you found this podcast,

01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:53.280
give it a rating and a nice review. Believe me, it goes a long way. I don't think anyone's written

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:58.400
an iTunes review for the show in like three years. So if you haven't written written one yet,

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:04.640
we'd really appreciate it. Thank you. That's that's all I can think of. Join our discussions

01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:10.720
throughout the week at vognetwork.com slash discord. I guess that's it. That's all I've got

01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.600
to say. Let's go around and get final thoughts. Loki, what's your final thought for this week?

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:24.880
I gotta go play more Minecraft. I'll try to play something else to 200,000 blocks you amateur go

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:31.200
for 300,000 next time. I know I need to prove your love of Minecraft because I'm doubting you

01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:37.440
right now. You're right. I gotta prove everybody. My final thought I'll just give a cheap plug to

01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:41.280
my personal Twitch channel over at Rob Roberts because we've had some fun Final Fantasy 14

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:47.200
streams. I've almost hit two of the three criteria to be a partner. If I stream tomorrow,

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:53.040
which I probably will unless I have an IRL thing come up, I will have the 25 hours and I will have

01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:57.360
the whatever it is however many streams you need in a month 12 or something like that. I will have

01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:03.280
both of those. I just won't have the 75 average viewers. So I'm a little ways away from that. But

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:11.120
hey, every every view counts. Thank you over at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, my personal channel.

01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:15.680
And of course twitch.tv slash vog network is where you can find us live on Sunday nights.

01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:19.520
And I see that we just got a hype train here at the end of the show. Thank you. Thank you. Thank

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:24.000
you. I'll give you all your credits here after the credits. But let's get to those credits. We'll

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.160
see you in seven days. Hopefully the gang's all back together next week because it will literally

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.800
have been a month. But we're excited to have Dark Soccer Loki and myself all together again in a

01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:39.840
week. Have a great night everybody. We'll see you next time. Good night. You've been listening to
