18000	26000	One possible translation? Microsoft applied for a patent for allowing a PC to validate a game disk enabling a diskless Xbox Series console to license and run that game.
26000	29000	A patent is not a guarantee that it'll happen, but it is a neat consideration.
29000	36000	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to discuss this story and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	61000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode number 915 of our show for tonight, May the 22nd of 2022.
61000	67000	My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined by my co hosts. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
67000	68000	Hello.
68000	70000	Hi, how are you doing?
70000	71000	I'm doing good.
71000	80000	Good. Also joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie. Oh, she just sat down. I was gonna say she stepped away, but then she stepped back. Hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
80000	81000	Hi.
81000	84000	Hi, you have impeccable timing. How are you?
84000	86000	Well, I'm okay.
86000	93000	All right. Did you go shopping this weekend? Because I see a bag with kitties on it behind you. At least that's what it looks like from a distance. Okay, I was
93000	113000	I went earlier. And what I do is that when I go to different places, I sort them by the kind of material they are in the back of my car. Oh, so what the reason why I do that is so that I can like take a bag to my office. It's got art supplies, I can take a bag to the kitchen for food, I can take one to the bathroom for toiletries.
114000	137000	But in this case, the stuff that goes in here usually art supplies. And I've been scouring all the Rosses I can find near me. Because I lucked into acrylic paper, which is typically something like 20 to 30 bucks for 10 sheets of paper, which and I don't know I found them for two bucks a pop.
137000	145000	I don't know if it's a national chain, but Ross dress for less or some of my friends all over the place. Some of my friends affectionately call it cross dress for less.
145000	156000	Well, it it just happened to have sometimes and I bought Copics they had a pack of Copic chows that had colors I didn't have so I picked them up.
156000	163000	You can get good deals those places I get coffee finding a Copic a set of Copics is like finding a unicorn though.
163000	172000	I get coffee supplies to those places for cheap not just the cups for like sugar free sweeteners and all that type of stuff you get cheap. That stuff's more common. Yeah.
172000	178000	The pack of Copic markers that I paid 20 bucks for are about 35 retail.
178000	183000	And on top of that it's a high end art supplies so we love a sale with.
183000	192000	That's true. I was I was like, I found the pack and that now mostly I work with Copic sketch markers which are about $8 per marker.
192000	201000	But I'm not going to say no to a pack of Copic chow like it's the same ink same quality same nibs. I was like, heck yeah, and it had a blue multi liner in it which I was looking for.
201000	205000	So, that's cool. And I can buy canvas is really cheap there too.
205000	215000	That's good because there's no, no longer there used to be an art supply store that was everywhere called Aaron brothers my mom that was my mom's favorite store because they're Aaron brothers is hardly an art supply store, well but they're they're
215000	222000	they did framing and they're no longer anyway they went out, they all went under. So, yeah, I just remember there's still loved going there.
222000	229000	I think university artists still around so is a blix art supply which is a bigger chain and they are dedicated art.
230000	242000	There's, I actually I buy Copics at Michael's of all places because the Joanne's here doesn't have a very good selection. And the Michaels actually does, and they'll sometimes do like a buy one get one half price.
242000	251000	And for Copics that's unbelievable. Well believe it or not it's a video game podcast but you know what we know that you want sales on all the merchandise to make your fan art.
251000	264000	So when you all out there are celebrating the dead by daylight dating sim that's coming out we'll talk about later in the show or is literally doing dead by daylight fan art is dark soccer showing off on stream, because we do take live every Sunday night
264000	275000	at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific, and they can catch the VOD if they want to see it twitch.tv slash vog network that's VOG network, and we'll talk about deals for all sorts of things.
275000	289000	We also sometimes talk about other types of media, not just video games, but Loki I can't help but notice you've got a classic eight bit Disney game playing behind you because there were, there were some really good like Capcom had the Disney license for games in the
289000	296000	job with they made some great Mickey Mouse could pay DuckTales of course all 10 classics but you plan tonight, rescue.
297000	317000	Yeah, I have a feeling this has to do with that movie that just came out a few days ago. Because it's up. Go ahead. Absolutely fantastic. Yes, I'm seeing it all over the game blogs because I guess they brought back the Sonic the hedgehog that everybody hated from the original trailer and they call them ugly.
317000	334000	Yes, but I was laughing because ugly Sonic apparently does appearances at fan conventions now and I was just laughing because that's just like that's such a like I haven't even seen the movie, but that's just like such a thing for ugly Sonic to do to capitalize on that one appearance
334000	355000	that they made and believe me, you all know I do multiple things I don't just host to LR I've met a lot of people in my other gig that try to make that one appearance that they did last for a long time. What I will, I will, I will just say two words that will illustrate this point very well. Miss Vangie.
355000	378000	Well, that's that's that's an entire empire based off of a infamous exit. But okay, so but it's not even though all the gaming blogs are talking about ugly Sonic. My understanding is the movie just consistently throws like, like that's every Gen X millennial like Zillennial or the trail generation like that, like the our age basically references everywhere.
386000	410000	They integrate the pop culture like cartoon and live action stuff, and like even like CG puppets, like all sorts of things together in like one cohesive world. It's not like Space Jam where it's like, hey, you remember that? Hey, you remember that? Like it actually makes sense like in the world and, and they make fun of things that it's, it's hilarious. The premise is hilarious.
411000	427000	Just like the jokes are ridiculous in a lot of the things. I don't know. It's like, I know when I saw like the trailer for the movie, I was like, you know, I like Andy Samberg. I like Oh, gosh, I can't remember the other guy's name.
427000	456000	Um, we don't like that much. No, I can John Mulaney. So I, so I like their work a lot. Like they're great writers on SNL. They have a lot of really funny stuff that they do in that. And like, there is just like, it just comes like all of their like personality comes out and all these characters and stuff and they just it's it's hilarious, like the different like characters that they bring back and like just the whole bunch of stuff.
457000	473000	The whole plot line. Everything is ridiculous. And some of the gags that they do even like with the ugly Sonic stuff. It's just, it's hilarious. It's all hilarious. It's so good. Like, I don't know. Like I was watching as like, this is why is it this good? Like this is ridiculous. It shouldn't even be this good.
474000	500000	Um, DJ rama. I'm sorry. Let me get some several comments in our chat room. sj 100. Matt says is the movie good. It looked totally trashy in the sense that it knows it's trashy and it's just joking on itself. DJ rama says there's some cringe but overall it was really good. The remake of the rescue Rangers theme is trash though. Mike Deaf says it was okay for me not that great but funny and entertaining way better than Space Jam two. So there is that
501000	502000	that is a low bar to hit but yes.
504000	528000	All right, well, I'll check it out ways but I'm a sucker for good reference. Somebody sent me there's like a billboard in the background that shows Doug from Nickelodeon's Doug is now a lawyer and like the gag was really funny. It said something like there's nothing funny about injury because his name was Doug funny. And it's Yes. And that was that was funny. So there's a lot of that stuff. There's absolutely a ton of that stuff.
529000	554000	There's a joke that's about like, it's, you know, like the Batman Superman stuff. Well, this one's like Batman versus et. And then they they they see see that on a billboard and then they come back like immediately right after that and actually show a clip of the movie. And it's so stupid. I'm a sucker. It's great. I'm a sucker for a quick hit pun. Like I'm for a quick hit. There's so many why I loved Mitch Hedberg.
555000	579000	Like that was the entire routine. It feels a little bit like like, I don't want to not really necessarily compare it to the Zucker Brothers stuff. But it's kind of like that where there's a lot of just like gags in the background and some of this stuff. Like if you don't like notice it, you might like miss a joke. Like I was laughing throughout the movie like a bunch of things that my kids like they don't get the reference because of like half the stuff in there.
580000	594000	I was gonna say some of the soccer movie stuff is kind of lame. Some of it is classic, obviously, like some of the old school stuff is classic. Like but then I thought like, Oh, but they did the later scary movies, movies after the Wayans brothers, right? Because like the way I don't want to, but the later I don't want to
595000	617000	spoil too much, but like, so like zipper and gadget end up like becoming a couple. And so they have a family. So you have to imagine, well, how's that work? A fly and a mouse? Well, they elaborate on that. And it's hilarious. All right. All right.
617000	638000	I have to check it out some way. Sounds funny. Yeah. All right. Let's get into video games. I know. I know. But we got it. We got to talk about video games, or we're not allowed to call ourselves a video game podcast. But you know what, there's there's lots of platforms out there with media that are dipping their toe into gaming. And I think that's gonna do our kickoff topic for tonight. Loki, what do we got?
638000	667880	Yeah, so tick tock has already, they're adding games to their platform, because, you know, they want to get people on that platform, and they want to stay there. So they've added a few small games, and they're planning to roll out more games as part of I guess, Southeast Asia later this year. Right now, they are. I don't really have that many games added in there. They have, I guess,
668640	697920	was a disco loco 3d. It's a game from Zynga. And then they also have like some other like free to play stuff. It's a lot of mobile games like Marvel snap. So yeah, they're going to be incorporating more games into the platform. I don't know how that necessarily like, is it just that you can go play games there? Or is it like, does that integrate with the platform somehow? Like, I'd be curious to see what that means. Like, are you sharing clips of the
697920	699440	games? I mean, like, what is it?
699480	727760	I imagine it integrates with the platform a little bit. It's kind of it kind of reminds me of when Facebook was kind of doing this through messenger. And I think to some extent, they still have it. But I know they were pushing it pretty hard for a little bit is that in messenger, you could just like jump right into a game of Pac Man or something like that, where you actually but it was like a Pac Man competing against the other person type of thing. By the way, happy birthday, Pac Man. Maybe that's why it's on my my brain tonight. But I think this is something like that is that it probably is
727920	757640	still launched within the tick tock app. But it is more of a gaming experience. I mean, if it was smart, they would allow you to share clips and things like that. But I don't know, I would think a lot of the success of this depends on the quality of the game. There's a lot of mobile games that have a reputation for being crappy mobile games. That's why I think when Facebook had Pac Man, it was interesting, because Pac Man has a reputation behind it. Everybody knows what Pac Man is, you know, if tick tock got Mario Kart, people would pay attention.
758220	769480	Yeah, even Mario Kart mobile wasn't as good as the mainline games, but I digress. You know, I don't know if tick tocks going to really break through if the games don't get people to notice. You know what I mean?
770300	782080	No, I get what you're saying. And yeah, I don't know if they're going to be I mean, they mentioned a game. So it's like, I don't know, maybe like,
782520	794760	I mean, they might they might do that. Okay, so I think about like, it take talk as a platform really makes its living. I don't know what else to call it off of people endlessly watching. That's it's
795520	806240	they make they make their money off of people's off of content creators stealing stuff from people of color, and then calling it their own and then making it popular. So take talk gets more revenue.
806280	810840	Oh, that's that's any platform. That's Instagram as well. That's that's any any that's Twitter. It's all
810840	813120	Don't be dismissive about it, though. It's a very big thing.
813120	819160	I'm not being dismissive about it. Excuse me. I'm pointing out that this is a problem on every social media platform. It's not something that's unique to
819200	828200	My point was that tik tok has been very recently called out on it. And it's been big news specifically on them very recently.
828960	829520	Um,
830760	849240	now I lost my train of thought, but people tend to just kind of endlessly watch tik toks, you know, one after the other. And I think Instagram is a very similar sort of thing like Instagram stories or whatever it is. And on Instagram, I know that you will see ads because I do
849240	879120	chuckle. I will often see these ridiculous looking game ads where I know I know the game is nothing like the ad, because there's a lot of those ad will show like, I don't know the the mafia guy stealing someone's stealing someone's girlfriend or something. And then they drive off together and they're being chased by zombies and all these ludicrous things. You know, the game looks nothing like it. But the stories. Oh, God, what was the other one? There was one where like Kathy Bates was in the ad, and it made all this news. I think we even talked about it on
879120	908560	the show. And like, it's a fucking match three puzzle game. But the ad was so over that was like grandma's mystery mansion or something. I don't want to give the game free advertisement anyway. But like it's like these ads are so ludicrous. And they're telling you to tap to download the game, which I bet a lot of people don't do. Maybe some because the ads are so silly. But in tik tok, and this whole integration thing, I would imagine as you're endlessly scrolling tik tok content, you're going to come
908560	938200	across, you know, an ad or something, and it's just click here to play now. And I think that will probably be something that is what they're going to do is have it so you just click and play the game right now. But again, I think if the games aren't interesting, nobody's going to really care. I also, you know, one thing I see on again, it doesn't matter what the platform is, it's something that you know,
938200	967760	it hits in one place, and it spreads everywhere is these filters, right? See it on Instagram, Snapchat, tik tok, they all have some version of it, where, you know, you see the filter. And it's like, I don't know what what Pokemon or what what Pokemon is my team. And it shows like six random Pokemon that go over your head, and you sit there and react to your team. And people watch that. It's like, oh, yay, I got a team I like or Oh, I got all pidgeys and rotatas. That's garbage.
967920	997440	You know, people will watch that stuff for whatever reason. Because we're bored. But what if there's a game somehow out of those filters? That's where I thought maybe it would go is that you you play the game and watch people react live to it. Kind of like twitches mo or YouTube's I guess a certain component of that. But I would I would think maybe there's something there. I'm surprised when I heard tik tok is getting into gaming. It wasn't just, oh, they're trying to throw games at it like
997440	1016360	Facebook did like Netflix is doing all this stuff. I'm surprised it wasn't like they're trying to do something different with it. They're trying to gamify something they're already doing. But as pointed out earlier, all of these platforms all steal from each other. Anyway, so there's that. Let's see.
1016360	1046240	DJ Rama S and chat says, I like tik tok better when it was called vine. Honestly, yes. RIP vine ahead of its time. And I don't know how Twitter ran that out of business. But they sure did. Because right. Twitter bought vine, didn't they? Or my parents go though. There was that to Twitter ran that out of business, too. So I don't, I don't know what happened there. But no vine was great. But this it was okay. So I just said earlier, I love a quick hit joke. And that's
1046240	1054400	all vine was. You didn't have a lot of time on vine to set something else up. tik toks let you go longer. Instagram, Snapchat, they'll let you go longer.
1054400	1084320	They just poked me for 10 minute videos. On on tik tok, you can do 10 minute videos on tik tok. No, they said they're they're rolling out 10 minute videos. Like I was in the five minute crowd. And I mean, really, all I put on there is just like, stuff I did in dead by daylight to advertise my channel. And then, like pinball stuff when I went to Golden State pinball Expo. But there's people who go on there to I don't even know.
1084400	1091760	It's, I don't think these people are very interesting. Like people show stuff. And I'm like, it's not very funny. But then again, I don't think a lot of people are funny.
1091760	1121760	Um, yeah, tick, tick tock's hard for me to get into, like, and I just wonder, like, is this an age thing? I don't know. Tick tock doesn't, I don't see a lot of content from people I know on it. Like, at least if I'm doing Instagram, or Snapchat, although a lot of my friends don't really use Snapchat. But like, I see people I know, and their content, tick tock, I I'll see, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival. But it's like, I'll see that something Paula Abdul posted, she's great. One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival. But it's like, I'll see that something Paula Abdul posted, she's great. One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival
1121760	1151760	One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival

1361760	1366000	When you see her Horse and stuff, it's like, it's all thirst-trapped stuff
1366000	1376120	When you see her Horse and stuff, it's like, it's all thirst-trapped stuff Um, then, like her YouTube and Instagram is all pimple popping things Yeah, but it starts to learn what you like
1376120	1379760	Yeah, but it starts to learn what you like Don't knock it. I watch those too
1379760	1386600	those platforms start to learn what you're engaging with and then it keeps showing you more of that, for better or for worse
1386600	1389540	You know, that's what a lot of social media platforms do
1389540	1395220	do. So, um, bonds, double six says have never viewed seen
1395220	1399020	anything connected to tick tock. It's getting hard to escape. I
1399020	1401540	have a hard time figuring out the secret sauce with tick tock.
1401540	1405940	I have an account. I made one video because a local artist
1405940	1408500	friend was like, you should get on it and make a video. And so
1408500	1411740	we made a video together backstage to show. And I thought
1411740	1415700	it was I thought it was stupid. Like I like not it was not this
1415700	1417940	other artists. I made the joke or whatever. And I thought it
1418140	1421780	was stupid. It did get a lot of views for being a throwaway
1421780	1424420	video. And I was like, what the hell? You know, I don't
1424420	1426620	understand this thing. But I don't I don't know what content
1426620	1429860	to make for it. I really don't. So I don't know. Maybe I'll
1429860	1430820	figure that out someday.
1431300	1433300	I just some of these names people have
1434260	1435380	the names on tik tok.
1436220	1439660	Yeah, like Lord Panda waffles. I just saw that name just now. And
1439660	1440580	I think it's a great name.
1440620	1444180	That's Yeah, I mean, it is a great name. A lot of MMO is in
1444180	1446780	video games. You see silly gamer tags and stuff too.
1446860	1452940	I saw I saw a sassy pants. Give it a on in another game.
1453220	1457980	Well, they're a fake fake bitch. sassy pants, by the way, was the
1457980	1459860	name of my old Warcraft character for those who don't
1459860	1464060	know. Let's see Zen monkey 11 says the secret sauce is it
1464060	1467820	short and to the point. You don't have to be that short
1467820	1470180	though. Because I've, you know, again, you just talked about the
1470180	1472820	10 minute videos, the five minute videos. So yeah, be that
1472820	1477780	short. Like vine was short and to the point. I would say I've
1477940	1481180	definitely skipped past my fair share of tik tok videos because
1481620	1485940	too too long to build up. It's just like the same problem with
1485940	1489460	a lot of youtubes too because the first minute will be Hey,
1489460	1491900	everybody, welcome to my YouTube channel. If you want to keep the
1491900	1495180	channel going. Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe. And
1495180	1495500	today,
1496660	1498820	a lot of them though have chapter markers on them now
1498820	1501340	though. So that makes it better. That's good. We know I can skip
1501340	1502460	the sheer space ads.
1503700	1507740	See, bonds double six says at work now watching anime when I'm
1507740	1510780	not working at some gaming or just regular adulting things.
1512140	1514860	So all right. Yes,
1514900	1518300	enough though. I am that person who pulls up YouTube to watch
1518300	1519260	documentaries.
1519820	1522860	Well, there is I mean, there is no shortage of all sorts of
1522860	1525300	content on there. And there's some great gaming documentaries
1525300	1529780	on there too. Like, I think of the Final Fantasy 14 1.0
1529780	1532180	documentary that's on there. That's really good. You know,
1532740	1537020	like, I like stuff like Did you know gaming and you know, unseen
1537020	1540900	64. And I actually watched a really good one today about
1542020	1545900	Stephen King stint as Richard Bachman, where the name came
1545900	1549260	from, why he did it and about the controversy by the book
1549260	1549820	rage.
1551020	1555660	And it was a 20 minute video. And it gave the information and
1555660	1558260	it was actually a really good video. Those are the that's what
1558260	1560740	I go to watch is stuff that's going to teach me something.
1560780	1563180	Well, for better or for worse, a site like YouTube with the
1563180	1566100	search bar has everything. You know, if you need to know how to
1566100	1569900	fix something, their algorithm sucks. Yeah, they will show you
1569900	1572100	the same video you watched two months ago.
1573660	1578740	Don't you want to see it again? All right. So until we have
1578740	1580820	more, I guess that's all there is to say on Tick Tock getting
1580820	1583980	into gaming is that they're testing it. I just don't know
1583980	1585900	how much engagement they're really going to get with it
1585900	1588220	unless they literally just dropped the game right in front
1588220	1591500	of you as you're scrolling through all these endless things
1591500	1595140	as you're looking at Tick Tock, I don't know. So yeah, I would
1595140	1599660	have to like, you know, it. I don't know if they're doing
1599660	1602180	anything meaningful with it, aside from just like, okay,
1602180	1603980	we're going to advertise games on there. And then we'll split
1603980	1607860	the revenue with whatever you guys sell or make off of it.
1607860	1611500	Like, I don't know, I, I just don't see them doing anything
1611500	1614340	meaningful with it. So far, like the other platforms, I've tried
1614340	1616940	to integrate that stuff like Facebook and whatnot, haven't
1616940	1619940	really done too much. Yeah, it's like, we'll have this news
1619940	1623060	cycle. And then Oh, turns out, nobody's really engaging with
1623060	1627540	it. So yeah, isn't that kind of true about Facebook gaming, the
1627540	1630260	live streaming section to like, they, they, they'll get in the
1630260	1632580	news, because it's like, oh, they've got all these creators.
1632780	1636300	And as much as I don't really care for Facebook, but I also
1636300	1638820	realized, like, I have to check it every now and then, or I'll
1638820	1641020	miss people's major, like, I'll miss that people are getting
1641020	1645060	married, and that type of stuff. So I'll load it up. But like,
1645060	1648700	never, never do I see on my Facebook feed anything about
1648700	1653180	Facebook gaming. And you would think Yeah, I mean, I'm not
1653180	1656020	gonna watch it anyway. But you would think they'd be trying to
1656020	1661300	target me a little bit. It's weird. Anyway. All right. Well,
1661300	1663860	let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video
1663860	1665940	games that we have been playing this week, the things we've been
1665940	1669340	doing that aren't tick tock. How was your gaming week Dark
1669340	1670300	Soccer? We'll start with you.
1671260	1674980	Um, Terranigma is getting a little bit more interesting,
1674980	1680620	although it's like still a fairly simple game. Like, the
1680620	1685500	story is interesting, but it's so fucking weird. And like, I
1685500	1689580	did have something good happen, like in in my my last stream, it
1689580	1693660	was pretty cool. You have to go find this girl and they allude
1693660	1698300	that she's surrounding herself with illusions. And then when
1698300	1701260	you when you find her and you talk to the people in the town,
1701260	1704500	and everyone's nice and you lay down at the end, and you wake up
1704500	1709340	and there's all zombies trying to eat you and you can you can
1709380	1716100	shoot their heads off and tables fly at you. And you there's
1716100	1719740	these ghosts, like things that look almost like they almost
1719740	1724180	remind me of Jomon pottery. But if you hit them, these ghosts
1724180	1726380	come out and they like try they suck you back to the beginning
1726380	1731980	of the level. So I've been using my safe states a lot. And like,
1732340	1735460	you have to go find this girl's dog and all this stuff. And it's
1735460	1741260	just this weird sort of denial thing going on in her with her
1741260	1744460	little world of zombies. And I haven't found the girl yet. I
1744460	1750180	think I did something out of turn. But it's a it's a really,
1750780	1754540	the game has more depth than I thought it did at the beginning,
1754540	1765380	even if the delivery is a little bit. Hmm. Awkward. Awkward
1765380	1770540	delivery, I can put it forth like that, like you do. Like you
1770540	1774300	wake up this one thing like you wake up all the animals in the
1774300	1777820	world. And then suddenly you can talk to the animals and you have
1777820	1781940	this weird cutscene that doesn't make any sense. And I just a lot
1781940	1785900	of it just is really awkward. And I can see why it didn't come
1785900	1789820	out over here. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but I have
1789820	1796620	played better put together games in general. The music is is okay.
1797700	1803540	There have been some pieces that I translate them as really bad.
1803540	1807420	So they're interesting to listen to. Like the instrumentation and
1807420	1809420	some of them is weird. And I found some music I really enjoyed
1809420	1814140	and I like the animations for the main character arc. And I
1814140	1817940	like his little like, purple blob thing that just shows up
1817940	1823340	out of out of nowhere to be sarcastic to him named Yomi. So
1823700	1829620	I'm enjoying the game. It's just not what I expected it to be.
1830740	1833940	But it's it's pretty fun. I'm so I'm gonna keep up with it. I
1833940	1836540	mean, I think I'm kind of pushing through it at a good
1836540	1843100	pace. And of course, Dead by Daylight. I play I ended up
1843100	1845940	like I don't even know what my deal was yesterday, but I could
1845940	1851740	not play my best characters to save my life. And then I'm
1851740	1855020	actually starting to see now where I'm getting loading screen
1855020	1858180	lag that a lot of people on Steam are also getting and the
1858180	1862580	rubber banding that they've been talking about. Where it's like,
1862860	1865860	you you're chasing after someone, for example, and then
1865860	1869900	it snaps, like it snaps you back, like another position like
1869900	1874700	you've been pulled back by rubber band. And I don't know
1874700	1879060	what it is, because Finara and I were talking about it. And
1879060	1884100	Finara, I will be getting to that. Thank you. Is that the
1884100	1886980	toxic survivors, the bully squads have been out in force.
1888020	1890780	And although I did have something really funny happen on
1890780	1894580	Thursday, I finally got to play Haddonfield, which I haven't, I
1894580	1897020	haven't played it yet, except for the time Finara and I ran
1897020	1901540	around exploring. And it was clear, I didn't know where I was
1901540	1905820	going. And the survivors started to be, you know, bullyish and
1905820	1908300	everything. And as I like to say, they fucked around and
1908300	1914140	found out. They got sloppy, I got on my game. One person
1914140	1921300	disconnected to, to Death Hooks. And I felt sorry for the UE at
1921300	1924340	the end and I let her escape. I let her get the hatch. I
1924340	1927300	couldn't find the hatch though. That Haddonfield level is small,
1927300	1933380	but weird. I don't hate it. But I miss old Haddonfield and I
1933380	1938140	never thought I would say that. Yeah, it's very different. But
1938140	1942380	other than that, I've been watching people on the PTB. The
1942380	1947660	dredge, haha. That, that's a very interesting character
1947660	1952060	concept. And I super love it, except he just, he reminds me a
1952060	1956620	little bit of some of the scenes from The Thing. And that
1956620	1960180	is a movie I cannot watch because I had bad nightmares
1960180	1962660	about it. Like I cannot watch that movie and the dredge makes
1962660	1964980	me think a little bit of it. But the locker teleporting
1964980	1968500	mechanic is really cool. And now, you know, I'm a lore nerd.
1968940	1972380	I've probably read through everybody's stories and the
1972380	1977980	extra things. And I really liked that they brought Hattie into
1977980	1984060	it because she was mentioned in three other tomes before we even
1984060	1989060	saw her. And then there was like the Jacob person that she was
1989060	1992140	writing to also mentioned in the lore. And then I think there was
1992140	1998020	something about the person who basically created the doctor. So
1998020	2000820	I really think that now they're starting to look a little bit
2000820	2004820	more to their actual lore and starting to tie it all together.
2005140	2008140	Because I think that there's a big contingent of us that's
2008140	2011660	really into the lore. And we want to see these things, we want
2011660	2016740	them to expand on it. Well, I did also buy another game and I
2016740	2021700	cannot play it. I bought Evil Dead. Right now, now it's only
2021700	2029100	on Epic Games Store if you want it on a non console. And they
2029100	2032740	marked it down to like 39. And then they're doing like some
2032740	2037060	mega sale right now where you can get a $10 off coupon. So I
2037060	2041140	paid 30 bucks for the game. So I'm not going to return it. But
2041140	2046140	it won't run in Windows 11 arm. It doesn't the x64 emulation is
2046140	2048380	not where it should be to run that game. Of course, I still
2048380	2051460	have the same problem with Dead by Daylight that I know the game
2051460	2055540	will run. I know the game will work. It's the anti cheat that
2055540	2058180	they use that won't run and the game will not run without the
2058180	2064180	anti cheat. So I'm hoping that the Evil Dead comes out on
2064180	2067020	Stadia because I'll probably buy it again. It looked like I
2067020	2074180	watched LC play it last night. It was that shit. It's intense.
2074620	2078940	And it looked like it was a lot of fun. So I'm one of these days
2078940	2081460	I'll get to play it but I did put a lot of attention into it.
2082700	2086300	So that's right out in word scapes like I'm number 12 in
2086300	2087740	the tournament today. So whatever.
2088180	2092660	All right. Loki, we'll go to you. How was your gaming week?
2093340	2099140	I was just Minecraft again. So I put out a new hardcore video.
2099140	2104020	And then I've been trying to get a farm, a raid farm to work, or
2104020	2106540	at least a stacking rate farm to work. But the server that we
2106540	2111900	play on, it had its runs what's called paper MC and paper tends
2111900	2117100	to mess with technical redstone stuff. And so I built the farm
2117100	2121100	up and it didn't work quite right. So I had to tear it all
2121100	2125820	down again. And so now I'm researching new farm designs to
2125860	2132100	build. So there's that. Um, what else? Oh, I got this cool new
2132100	2134900	t shirt. I gotta show you. So you're gonna love this. I mean,
2135180	2138300	so check this out. See if we can move my mic.
2138420	2140220	Was that a pyramid head? I can't tell.
2140580	2141100	No.
2141620	2145580	Yeah, your green screen is green is the virtual green
2145580	2145980	screen.
2148540	2150540	Here, we'll fix that real quick. All right.
2151100	2153460	And by the way, can I mention one thing that I forgot to?
2153500	2157780	Yeah. I chased finara around in cold wind farm so I could
2157780	2161900	practice nurse. Oh, fun. And listening to a thing screen
2161900	2162620	makes me happy.
2163860	2167180	Oh, gosh, that's also okay. So that's like, that's the
2167220	2171940	background for dropout. The old DDR song. It is. Oh, wow. That's
2171980	2175020	that is. Where did you get that shirt from?
2175900	2177220	T Republic, I believe.
2177700	2180620	I'm gonna have to look at that. Yeah, that's, that's a throwback.
2180900	2181580	My gosh.
2181620	2187460	Yeah. Yeah. It was from they just sent me an email. I think
2187460	2188540	it's frontier public.
2188980	2191580	I'm a little shocked that I recognized it, but also not.
2193940	2195260	All right. Anything else?
2195260	2196780	I thought I had to get it. Anything else?
2197860	2200020	That that's basically it. Yeah. Okay.
2201020	2205500	Let's see. My gaming week. I've been playing more fun fancy 14
2205500	2207660	because of course I have been. I've been playing a little bit
2207660	2210420	of dead by daylight as well. I've been sort of trying to get
2210420	2212620	back into killer a little bit. I have found that I kind of
2212620	2216580	enjoyed playing the plague right now in dead by daylight. I feel
2216580	2220500	like she inherently counters a lot of the meta plays that
2220500	2224580	survivors use right now. Because like, healing circle of healing
2224620	2227900	doesn't really matter with her. Because her mechanic is the
2227900	2231100	whole cleansing and everything anyway, anyway, dead hard. You
2231100	2234820	can still vomit on them if they did hard. So there's there's a
2234820	2238780	lot that, you know, kind of works with her that I find very
2238780	2243060	fun. I just find most survivors aren't prepared for her. So
2243060	2245860	that's the fun thing about playing her not to say I got
2245860	2249780	some four K's I get some no K's just you know, kind of goes back
2249780	2251380	and forth. My luck with her.
2251940	2254340	He always used to throw me off because of how tall she is.
2254940	2259300	Oh, yeah, there's that. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Ah, let's
2259300	2262820	see. And then in other games, so I'm continuing my, you know,
2262820	2267460	adventures in AR gaming and like Pikmin. I'm level 57 in
2267460	2271020	Pikmin Bloom now. So I've walked a lot of steps. I just walked
2271020	2276180	three and a half miles today in the heat. So that's, that's been
2276420	2278540	you know, I don't know, because that's a very passive type of
2278540	2281980	game. I don't do a lot in that game. But they had a big
2281980	2284540	community day because Niantic had a big community day this
2284540	2288340	weekend. And actually, some of my friends through Ingress, we
2288340	2292460	decided to meet up in Oakland. Because well, they weren't doing
2292460	2294900	anything for Ingress, but we all play the other stuff too. So we
2294900	2299740	decided to do Pikmin there and they were doing Pokemon Go had a
2299740	2304100	community day. So they were doing Alolan Geodude as well.
2304120	2307020	Oh, yeah, Mike Defton chat says all the community days. Well,
2307020	2311540	Niantic Niantic starting to lean into that a little bit. And they
2311540	2314100	actually they even have a whole website for community day. And
2314100	2317300	they're they've launched a whole brand around it. So Niantic
2317300	2321740	actually had a booth in Oakland. And so it was it was considered
2321740	2325460	one of the like Niantic attended events. They did some
2325460	2328640	virtual events, but this was like Niantic intended, attended.
2328740	2331580	So they had a booth set up with like, it was just silly stuff
2331580	2335300	like pins, but one of the pins I got was a Niantic community day
2335300	2338460	pin with that new logo on it and everything. So I mean, they're
2338460	2341740	they're leaning into the brand. They had like Wayfarer stickers
2341740	2344500	and stuff. So you can kind of see all their their new products
2344500	2347380	are trying to kind of fold into their brand in different ways.
2347740	2351260	And then, yeah, so I did the community day there and just,
2351260	2353900	you know, walked around a little bit. It was interesting because
2353900	2359700	they had, they put in like 10 fake pokey stops right in that
2359700	2362500	Jack London Square, which is a pretty decently populated area
2362500	2365620	with pokey stops anyway. And they added like 10 more. So it
2365620	2368620	was like I was just sitting there because I use the Bluetooth
2368620	2371940	and when I ran out of pokey balls, I just switch it to only
2371940	2375180	spin stops. And within like 10 minutes, I probably had 100
2375180	2378980	pokey balls again. So it's also interesting. And we'll get into
2378980	2381420	some of the Niantic controversy later. But it is very
2381420	2385980	interesting how they can set up fake pokey stops whenever they
2385980	2389500	want wherever they want. So it's that part of it's kind of
2389500	2394220	interesting. But it was honestly like I it was kind of lame for
2394220	2396860	Pikmin though, because Pikmin didn't generate the flower
2396860	2402380	spawns. It didn't generate off the the stops that they made for
2402380	2404940	the event. So it was like there wasn't very many places to spawn
2404940	2408100	flowers. So it was really just Pokemon. And so for my friends
2408380	2410740	they play Pikmin and Ingress, they don't really play Pokemon.
2410940	2414140	They were a little bit like, there's not much to do. But it
2414140	2416500	was fun to see everybody and hang out together. And I guess
2416700	2422300	that's that's the fun in it. So yeah, so outside of that, don't
2422300	2426020	really have a lot else to share. I Oh, no, I guess I could
2426020	2430540	mention that Pokemon home got an upgrade. Because now Pokemon
2430540	2436020	home will work with Arceus and brilliant diamond shining pearl.
2436300	2439020	So all I've really done so far as I went into home to like
2439020	2441900	organize some stuff and do a little bit of transfers, I
2441900	2445180	upgraded my save files and did the transfers to get the bonus
2445180	2448460	Pokemon that they're given away for the home upgrade. But if
2448460	2452380	you're a Pokemon person, and you like home at all, just check out
2452380	2456460	that that all got upgraded to 2.0. And now you can use it with
2456660	2460260	the two latest Pokemon releases, because you can only use it with
2460260	2464180	really sword and shield and go and and transferring stuff all
2464180	2466620	the way from bank before you can really use it with the newer
2466620	2469380	games, but they've now patched it in. So you can use it with
2469380	2472780	the newer releases. So that kind of makes that stuff fresh again,
2473020	2477500	I really need to go back and beat Pokemon Arceus because that
2477500	2480340	was all right when I was moving. So I was really into it for like
2480340	2483300	a week. And then it was like the move took over and I never went
2483300	2488700	back to it. So I need to do that at some point. All right, let's
2488700	2492620	get into some more news. Not a lot of housekeeping stuff. But I
2492620	2496260	will mention because we're getting close now. We're only a
2496260	2499220	month away from our 20th anniversary here of Orange
2499220	2503340	Launch Radio, we celebrate 20 years on the air for better. And
2503340	2507660	for worse. At the end of June, June 26 will be that show are
2507660	2510540	technically our birthday is June 23. But that would be in the
2510540	2513380	middle of the week. So we're going to do a celebrate all that
2513380	2519460	on June the 26th. So be here. All right. Let's talk about news
2519460	2522220	and what else is going on in the gaming world. Loki?
2523380	2528500	Yeah, so apparently, the word is that EA is looking for somebody
2528500	2533460	to swoop in and purchase them. Because you know, hey, that's
2533460	2534100	what's happening.
2537420	2541540	So they said in recent years, as media companies have taken
2541540	2544940	greater interest in the rapidly growing gaming industry.
2545780	2549300	Electronic Arts have held talks with a number of different
2549300	2552540	potential suitors, including Disney, Apple and Amazon.
2554220	2559300	Several sources with these talks say EA has been persistent in
2559300	2563780	pursuing a sale and has only grown more emboldened in the
2563780	2566220	wake of the Microsoft Activision deal.
2570220	2575100	Yeah, but like, maybe they don't like don't have the offer
2575100	2578140	they're like your games like Battlefield hasn't been doing
2578140	2578640	well.
2580380	2583300	Madden stuff, I guess it's all right. You just lost your FIFA
2583300	2587100	license, or maybe just didn't renew your FIFA license,
2587100	2587620	whatever.
2589740	2593220	So I don't know. I don't know if anyone will will purchase them.
2593220	2598860	But I guess they're just saying, Hey, we're out here, waiting for
2598860	2599980	you to purchase us.
2602300	2605100	Well, that's the I guess that list of suitors is kind of
2605100	2608100	interesting. I mean, because they're not really companies you
2608100	2611340	think about with gaming. I mean, I get the Apple one I get
2611340	2614500	because I see where they've got gaming, the Disney one, I guess
2614500	2616820	Disney did have some game publishing.
2619420	2623260	Yeah, yeah, they're interested in more licensing than developing
2623260	2628060	their games. So so but then the Comcast one is very like, I
2628060	2633020	mean, a lot of people are quick to point out, you know, the two
2633020	2637860	most hated companies in America are probably Comcast and EA. You
2637860	2640500	know, if you look at those, you know, when when it comes to
2640500	2643540	battle for the Oh, who's the worst company in the world? It's
2643540	2646300	usually those two are towards the top of the list. So it was
2646300	2650500	just together we can be the worst we'll combine our powers
2650500	2654580	of being the worst to be the even worse company. I don't
2654580	2658180	know. I'm, I'm not sure how EA would fit into that unless
2658180	2661500	Comcast to be more worse or rare, unless Comcast wants to
2661500	2666300	start publishing games. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know where
2666300	2669220	that fits in with it. Well, it's not gonna happen anyway. But it
2669220	2671940	could it could be that they just want to be purchased and then
2671940	2674900	they could still be making games but just like owned by another
2674900	2678380	company kind of like how we just had the acquisitions with some
2678380	2682180	of Square Enix's properties, where they're owned by another
2682180	2685260	company now, then they're still making games. It's just they're
2685260	2688100	not making games for Square Enix anymore. There. There's another
2688100	2691420	parent company that basically owns them. Yeah, it'd be nice
2691420	2693460	if someone threw billions of dollars your way, but
2693500	2698300	unfortunately, that's not happening right now. Would it be
2698340	2701060	like a big deal if Sony purchased them?
2702220	2705700	Um, I don't know me No, I am. But yeah, probably.
2706060	2708260	Personally, it's gonna be different for everyone. Will it
2708260	2711740	make huge news in the industry? Absolutely. But it sounds to me
2711740	2714980	and especially kind of based on you know, the the feedback of
2714980	2719220	the EA feels emboldened by the Activision Microsoft thing. I
2719220	2723260	would bet EA is trying to ask for too much money for what
2723260	2726100	they're really worth. And you kind of are pointing out that a
2726100	2730860	lot of their longtime franchises are not exactly taking a turn
2730860	2733460	for the better. And as more and more people are getting burned
2733460	2736260	out on the whole loot box thing and you see more regulation with
2736260	2739620	that when EA says this is where we make most of our money. I
2739620	2742620	think buying EA could be a dangerous prospect for many
2742620	2746060	people right now, especially now that they just lost the FIFA
2746060	2749220	license. And although I think most of us that don't think that
2749220	2752460	they net Yeah, I think that they I think with FIFA, they're just
2752500	2754700	now just licensing the football clubs.
2755740	2759540	And if you let me get to the point I would have, but most of
2759540	2763820	the, you know, the the EA stuff, they'll be fine without FIFA, I
2763820	2767660	really do think they will be. But just the fact that they are
2767700	2771660	they lost that is not a great look, you know, for a company
2771660	2774660	that's trying to sell themselves. Now they can't say
2774660	2777300	and we've got FIFA license for it, because they don't have it
2777300	2780900	anymore. You know, so I guess I think they'll be fine. Those of
2780900	2782580	us that have followed the industry in those games for a
2782580	2785100	while. Yes, they've, they've partnered with other soccer
2785100	2787620	clubs. And I really think FIFA will probably lose more from
2787620	2791780	that deal than EA will, but that's that's on them. So yeah,
2791780	2794820	they'll be fine. But I'm not sure investors see it that way.
2795660	2798340	We got this other company Konami, they're gonna make a
2798340	2801900	soccer game. It's gonna be amazing. Oh, wait.
2801900	2807820	Talk about somebody who ought to be sold. But that's a whole
2807820	2809820	nother story, I suppose. So
2809860	2812780	I must talk about a company that doesn't have anything of value
2812780	2813300	anymore.
2814260	2817620	Uh, quest buster and chat says from what I've read, the game
2817620	2821020	industry will blow past 200 billion in revenues by 2024,
2821020	2823780	which could partially explain why a company like Comcast once
2823780	2827180	an in Vivendi specialty is entertainment media like canal
2827180	2830420	plus in France, but once upon a time they owned Activision
2830460	2833300	Blizzard. Yes, it actually was not that long ago, really. So
2833300	2834300	yeah, it's very true.
2835860	2839420	S2100. Matt says I could have seen it. The EA game console
2839420	2843100	presented by Comcast, a cloud gaming console that won't be
2843100	2845020	subjected to bandwidth caps.
2846260	2850220	I hate that idea so much, but I could see it.
2851580	2853140	For sure. So
2854260	2855260	thanks. I hate it.
2855300	2858740	Thanks. I hate it. Yep, pretty much. Yeah, we'll see. I mean,
2858740	2863100	if they decide to sell. But meanwhile, there's other stuff
2863100	2864180	going on at EA, right?
2865220	2867980	Yeah, so along with that consolidation,
2868980	2875380	with the losing or not renewing their contract with FIFA, they
2875380	2880060	are now having layoffs at EA Austin, where they're dropping
2880060	2882780	200 or more customer support staff
2883860	2885780	that have been helping out with stuff there.
2886380	2889580	Again, not a great Well, I don't know sometimes
2890620	2894220	cutting back. I hate I hate to say it that way. Because, you
2894220	2896660	know, these are people that lost their jobs and so forth. But I'm
2896660	2900020	just speaking strictly like the investor side of things. Those
2900020	2903020	sort of cutbacks make a company a little more lucrative to that
2903020	2904620	sort of stuff, too.
2904700	2908540	Yeah, basically, they're taking it from in house and they're
2908540	2911140	going to be using a third party, I guess,
2911580	2915940	which means 100% full stop guaranteed customer service is
2915940	2920340	only going to get worse. Absolutely, it will get worse.
2920540	2923340	Because if you think customer service doesn't do shit for you
2923340	2926900	now, when it comes to restoring old accounts, or you were banned
2926900	2930300	inappropriately, just wait until a third party does it that
2930300	2931980	doesn't even have the proper access to
2932380	2934420	they're going to Romania and India.
2934460	2939820	They Oh, this is gonna be garbage, like, good fucking luck
2939900	2944020	for those of you that have a lot invested in EA online games. You
2944020	2946180	know, I don't know, maybe if you if you're playing Star Wars,
2946180	2948940	the old republic or something that like you're continuously
2948940	2952060	hitting EA products, or maybe dropping a lot of money on FIFA
2952060	2955660	or what have you. Good fucking luck if you need customer
2955660	2961340	service help, because that's Oh, boy, that's gonna be rough.
2963580	2968500	Anyway, let's talk about a gaming series, the dark soccer
2968500	2972580	and I talk a little bit about on this show just a tad, a little
2972620	2974740	a little bit. So we're gonna talk a little bit about dead by
2974740	2977460	daylight. But that's because there's actually a lot of news
2977460	2980580	going on with dead by daylight is that they just had their six
2980580	2984140	anniversary celebration stream, you know, kind of announcing
2984140	2986780	what's coming up for the sixth anniversary event that's
2986780	2989180	happening in June, where dark soccer kind of already
2989180	2991460	referenced, you have a new killer, you have a new survivor
2991460	2994620	that are on the public test build right now. But did you
2994620	2995460	watch the whole thing?
2996460	2999300	No, I didn't watch any of it. I only read secondhand the cliff
2999300	3002020	notes. I watched all of it. Yeah, well, I was working so I
3002020	3004500	couldn't I couldn't watch it. But I watched it after the fact.
3004540	3008900	Okay, that's cool. Yeah. Um, but I did see this trailer and
3008900	3011380	something that came a little bit out of left field a little bit
3011380	3015020	not. But I think for those that hadn't been paying attention to
3015020	3018260	every little rumor, this did come out of left field. And that
3018260	3021740	is that dead by daylight is officially launching a dating
3021740	3025380	sim. And it's called hooked on you, which is a very tongue on
3025380	3028260	tongue in cheek name. Because of course, in dead by daylight,
3028300	3033020	if you're a killer, you are placing survivors on a hook. If
3033020	3036420	you're a killer, you're a hooker. Yeah. So hooked on you
3036420	3039020	is the name of the obviously there's that play on dating.
3039820	3044780	This is being made by psy op, who made the I love you Colonel
3044780	3048780	Sanders dating sim. So you know, this is a company that got a
3048780	3053460	pedigree. Yeah, they would. They're gonna do fine with it.
3054220	3058860	They interviewed the guy behind it. And he was absolutely
3058860	3061980	hilarious. He's like, Well, I know this is normally serious
3061980	3064180	and very lethal. And we want to pay respect for that. But let's
3064180	3068380	make it silly. It was it was actually really worth watching.
3068580	3072980	That's cool. Um, yeah. And it this is just funny to me.
3072980	3076500	Because if you go to the dead by daylight, Twitter, which it has
3076500	3078660	a weird name, you would think they'd just be at dead by
3078660	3082900	daylight, but it's like, D by behavior, so dead by behavior,
3082900	3087300	bh vr. Yeah. So you have to go to that Twitter. If you look at
3087300	3091500	the replies to literally any tweet they've ever posted, the
3091500	3094780	replies will always have in the one of the first five replies
3094780	3098540	will always be when are you adding sex to dead by daylight
3098580	3103820	or sex when or when can I sex Dwight or you know, David or
3103820	3109020	whoever is the killer or survivor being posted about. And
3109020	3112900	I feel like in a way as much as this daylight, or excuse me,
3112900	3115300	this dead by daylight dating sim is funny and good news. I feel
3115300	3117980	like it's rewarding that behavior on Twitter is that all
3117980	3121660	those people not a little bit not that you're gonna have sex
3121660	3125020	in this game, but I do feel that those people are vindicated a
3125020	3131420	little bit, which kind of irritates me. So but anyway, um,
3132780	3136660	on a murderer's island, we're hooked on you takes place, you
3136660	3140540	will get to know four of the killers in the game, the trapper
3140580	3144740	huntress, wraith and spirit. And you will romance them and
3144740	3147540	apparently might be wondering which survivor Do you play as my
3147540	3149500	understanding is you play as yourself. You don't play as a
3149500	3152900	survivor. So the survivors flat out you play as an original
3152900	3155580	character. Yeah. So the survivors may show up in cameos
3155580	3159740	or something, but you're gonna play as yourself. And it's gonna
3159740	3162780	be in a locker. Yeah. And there's, you know, there's men
3162780	3165580	and women. So it's a for four people. It's a pretty diverse
3165580	3169540	lineup there. It's all dead by daylight behavior entertainment
3169540	3172020	originals. So you're not going to be romancing Mike Myers or
3172020	3174060	Freddie or any of that stuff. But I'm sure we can all
3174060	3177740	understand why, you know, those licenses only go so far, they
3177740	3180340	would have to license those care. So if this dating sim does
3180340	3184540	really well, maybe we'll get nemesis in it because it seems
3184540	3188220	like Capcom is very eager to license right now. The one thing
3188220	3192300	we haven't talked about, they also confirmed a second resident
3192300	3196540	evil DLC is on the way, which getting Ada Wong, which has not
3196540	3199980	happened for with it. Technically, they haven't
3199980	3202900	confirmed that. But wink, wink, nudge, nudge, the leakers that
3202900	3205680	said this was coming said it's Ada Wong and Wesker. And the
3205680	3209620	trailer VD leaks has been fairly accurate. And the information I
3209620	3212900	mean, it's called project W and the trailer was just screaming
3212900	3216700	that it's Wesker. So I don't see Yeah, how Yeah, so I'm sure I'm
3216700	3221460	sure it is Ada Wong. It's a bummer. I don't I guess it's not
3221460	3223620	to though. It's just Oh, no, it is to it's somebody from
3223620	3227300	Resident Evil zero. It's another feet. Rebecca or something
3227300	3229460	right was the other way back chambers. She's actually was in
3229460	3233380	the first Resident Evil. Okay, okay. My bad. She was when you
3233380	3237420	played through Chris's game. She was his kind of sidekick back
3237420	3242940	and forth. And played the piano for that one scene and and she
3242940	3248900	was though in another game with was it Carlos? Some other guy.
3249860	3252260	Oh, she's also in zero says Mike Depp. Okay, so we're both
3252260	3257380	right. That's my fan. Um, it's I'm a little bummed that Chris
3257420	3259820	is not going to be a fully fledged character. He's always
3259820	3262380	just going to be an alternate Leon, but whatever. I guess you
3262380	3266980	can't win them all. So. But yeah, so there's another
3266980	3271140	Resident Evil DLC coming. Also, I really wanted the killer to be
3271140	3276580	Lady Dimitrescu. And I know I know Wesker. I know Wesker is
3276580	3279060	maybe a third one show. Yeah, maybe a third one since
3279060	3281900	apparently Capcom is, you know, bargain basementing that out
3281900	3285340	right now. But I imagine it's I imagine that DLC sold really
3285340	3289540	well. And it's probably done a lot for you know, people love
3289540	3293940	it. So I think probably sees the win there. Don't forget about
3293940	3296340	the other news with that they're going to be doing revamps to
3296660	3299700	RuPaul's Drag Station. Oh, the Raccoon City Police Department,
3299700	3302780	the worst map. Yeah, that needs that is not the worst map. It's
3302780	3305940	my favorite map to play on his pig and Freddie as the worst map
3305940	3308380	for a survivor, I think. Well, I don't know. No, a lot of
3308380	3311340	survivors love it because they it's like a terrible map for
3311340	3315700	because of the library. That's it because of the library. But
3316980	3321260	I love getting RPD as pig. It's like my favorite thing is
3321260	3325500	getting RPD as pig. So well, how do you feel that they're
3325500	3328900	reworking it? Because it might not go and, you know, I know you
3328900	3332380	love to do the extra trap and all that stuff to get survivors
3332420	3334100	in that map, but they may
3334340	3338820	did actually play this trap or two and it was pretty fun. But
3339820	3345980	I think that I want them to keep this original layout like they
3345980	3349340	have but if they do other maps that you have a chance to get
3350060	3354780	that maybe have different things restricted or different openings
3354780	3358620	or different pathways, you know, kind of like how there's like
3358620	3362780	what 50,000 versions of batam. Yeah. And they all are pretty
3362780	3367100	much the fucking same. I think this is gonna be more of that. I
3367100	3371580	honestly do. Oh, there's more pulsing shit everywhere. Oh,
3371580	3377060	this there's a tentacle in the wall. Oh, I'm so scared. Oh, no.
3377100	3379420	Oh, this one doesn't have the hole in the wall from the
3379420	3380700	helicopter. Ooh.
3382100	3386180	I would like to see another Silent Hill DLC. But I don't
3386180	3391340	know what other killer they could put. Because they made the
3391500	3392740	most obvious one a survivor.
3393540	3398380	I would want them to do like the original mansion. I know it's
3398380	3401380	too big, but I would like for them to do like different areas
3401380	3405780	of the mansion. Cool. Cool. From the first Resident Evil. And if
3405780	3410940	they did a Silent Hill one, I would want it to be the mall
3410940	3414660	that Heather is trapped in in Silent Hill three. It's just
3414660	3416860	the room Cheryl, Heather, Cheryl, whatever.
3417180	3420700	Now, um, I don't know if we have a release date for hooked on
3420700	3423820	you. We just know it's Oh, later this summer. That's what
3423820	3427020	we know. And that it's coming to steam. So I don't think we have
3427020	3430460	any other platforms yet. But you know, the going theory is July.
3430620	3432900	Yeah. Which would make sense. That's right around their
3432900	3436540	anniversary and all that stuff. Now, Loki, I know you don't get
3436540	3439460	into Dead by Daylight the same way Dark Soccer and I do. But I
3439460	3443380	have to ask, could a dating sim sell you on Dead by Daylight?
3444020	3444420	No.
3445340	3446740	Why not? You're no fun.
3447260	3450460	I don't really play dating sims. So that wouldn't really
3450460	3454180	maybe your wife would get into Dead by Daylight. Probably not.
3454820	3458300	All right. Dark Soccer. I'm sure you'll be sure I'm sure every
3458300	3460540	Dead by Daylight streamer you and I both know will be
3460540	3462700	streaming this but I'm sure you're going to stream it as
3462700	3468380	well. Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. All right. Coming whenever they
3468380	3470980	finish it, I guess. All right. In the meantime, I'm sure it's
3470980	3474100	pretty much done. What I want to do those I want to see it
3474100	3477820	actually be successful. So that they bring out more characters.
3477980	3478780	Yeah, DLC.
3479540	3485180	Do you remember when I was into the guy I can't remember what
3485180	3487140	company it was had the dating sim but I played all the
3487140	3491980	Homestuck characters. And it was all web based. And they took it
3491980	3494820	down. I was really mad and I paid for it too. Well, and if it
3494820	3495940	does, I can't remember the name.
3496220	3499500	I was just gonna say if it does well, DBD will probably cross
3499500	3502140	over into other types of games too. I mean, this
3502140	3503740	Namco Hi, thank you, Dark Tessa.
3503820	3507180	This is hot on the heels of the Dead by Daylight board game too.
3507340	3511540	So, you know, which I ordered this. And I think if that does
3511540	3513540	well, and this does well, I think you're just going to see
3513540	3517980	DVD as a franchise grow into other places too. Which could be
3517980	3518620	interesting.
3518980	3521620	Maybe Loki, would you play the Dead by Daylight board game with
3521620	3527260	us? Maybe I want to do a live play of the board game when mine
3527260	3527820	arrives.
3528020	3529940	I'll try it. Yeah, we could do that. I'll try it.
3529940	3531620	And I ordered the full set.
3531780	3533860	Do you think it'll get here before the 20th anniversary?
3534220	3539300	That would be awesome if it did. I know. polyester did a video
3539300	3542700	about the orders, but I'd have to check the site to see when
3542700	3546620	the they're planning on shipping. Okay. All right. I'm
3546620	3547380	excited about it.
3547460	3549660	Well, in the meantime, let's move on to a completely
3549660	3551300	different headline from dark Sakura.
3552500	3556700	Yeah, so, uh, you know, and this is actually coming in light of
3556700	3561940	all of this bullshit coming from faux news about, oh, we're gonna
3561940	3565780	blame, you know, video game violence, blah, blah, blah, blah,
3565780	3571500	blah, same shit, different year, you know, but there is a study
3571900	3577340	that's out. This is that children could have a boost to
3577340	3583020	their intelligence by playing video games. So the study was on
3583020	3587260	American children between nine and 10 years old who spent more
3587260	3590140	time playing that when they spent more time playing video
3590140	3593460	games, they experienced a significant increase in their
3593460	3598180	intelligence stores. When retested two years later,
3598620	3605500	amounting to an extra 2.5 IQ points above the average. They
3605500	3611780	said that basically, other forms of screen time were also tested
3611780	3614340	such as watching videos, chatting on social media, and
3614340	3616460	they had neither a positive nor negative effect on
3616460	3621300	intelligence. For the record, the the study had zero funding
3621300	3625220	from anyone in the video game industry. They said that they
3625460	3628540	they did not examine the effects of screen behavior on physical
3628540	3632740	activities, sleep, mental well being or school performance. But
3632780	3637700	when just testing intelligence, that was the result. And it was
3637700	3642340	across the board. Um, I'm going to actually read this this quote
3642340	3646780	on here. And this is actually from Torkel Klingberg, who is a
3646780	3650620	professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Karolinska
3650620	3655300	Institute in Stockholm. Our result, our results support the
3655300	3658100	claim that screen time generally doesn't impair children's
3658100	3661060	cognitive abilities, and that playing video games actually
3661060	3664300	helps boost intelligence. This is consistent with several
3664300	3668860	experimental studies of video game playing. So the analysis
3668860	3674420	was on more than 9000 boys and girls. And it was on a long
3674420	3676860	term study. Like I said, there were there were two years that
3676860	3680820	they were all retested. And when they were nine to 10, they went
3680820	3683780	through different psychological tests to gauge their general,
3683820	3687540	you know, mental capacity, what their level of intelligence was,
3687540	3690100	you know, they were also asked how much time they spent
3690100	3694380	watching TV playing video games and on social media. On average,
3694380	3697460	they spent about two and a half hours a day watching TV, a half
3697500	3700940	hour on social media and one hour playing video games. Two
3700940	3703740	years later, 5000 of the children repeated the
3703740	3708020	psychological tests, and that they showed that kids who played
3708060	3712100	more than the average hour of video games wound up with higher
3712100	3715420	intelligence scores than the kids who spent less time playing
3715420	3722540	video games. And what they're thinking is that it provides
3722540	3726460	what what they're referring to as enriched environments, and
3726460	3729420	requires them to tackle tasks that they would not do every
3729420	3735180	day. For example, active strategy, planning, quick
3735180	3740580	executive decision making. The more that someone plays the
3740580	3745340	games, they build the neural pathways that establish the
3745380	3749860	their adaptation to those particular skills. And we know
3749860	3755100	that that's actually how the mind learns a skill is that it
3755100	3758540	forms a neural pathway that outlines this is how you do it.
3758540	3763380	I mean, it's where we get muscle memory from, for example, is
3763380	3767460	because that's formed that that connection with with the body to
3767460	3773980	just know how to do it. And another quote on here, who is an
3773980	3776940	associate professor of psychiatry, Charles R. Drew
3776940	3782380	University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles. That's
3782620	3787380	Dr. Anish Dubey, I think is how it's pronounced. But he says
3787380	3790380	that the more someone practices or plays these video games, the
3790380	3792460	more they reinforce the neural pathways involved in
3792460	3795380	accomplishing the objectives of the game. And those same neural
3795380	3798140	pathways may be involved in other types of real world
3798140	3800980	decision making that factor into our measure of intelligence.
3802180	3805740	Video games by design, require focus and attention to the
3805740	3808220	content presented and strategizing in the moment.
3808540	3811020	Whereas it's easy to watch something on television without
3811020	3814500	paying much attention to the content. If you watch a segment
3814500	3818260	on television and miss something you do not lose, and you can
3818260	3820580	still infer the missing parts based on the remaining
3820580	3826740	narrative. This would be harder to do in video games. So now
3826780	3830300	they're also talking about now of doing other studies where
3830340	3834060	they're want to find correlation between video game and mental
3834060	3838220	health after two years. And if it all if an improvement in
3838220	3843100	intelligence also correlates to better mental health. I have
3843100	3847460	learned that the smarter I get, more depressed I get, because I
3847460	3851740	understand that things are shitty. That that's just an
3851740	3856500	aside. But I mean, look at look at a lot of us, you know, how
3856500	3860260	many of us basically had a controller in our hand when we
3860260	3861500	were, you know,
3862660	3865620	little Yeah, I was gonna I was gonna say like, we all grew up
3865620	3868020	with video games. And I think we've heard for many years, you
3868020	3870780	know, video games are going to rot your brain. Yet most of us
3870780	3873300	that grew up on these games, we all turned out pretty
3873300	3876500	intelligent, you know, like, you know, and I don't know to what
3876500	3879620	extent the games are to thank for that. But they definitely
3879620	3882220	didn't rot our brains like we were told they were going to.
3883620	3886540	I would think it also depends on the genre of game that someone
3886540	3891100	typically plays. But definitely puzzle games, especially the
3891100	3896940	ones that are timed, and things like Pio Pio, or even Tetris,
3896940	3900380	you're learning your spatial awareness, along with quick
3900380	3905020	decision making. And then you have things that are like, like
3905020	3907620	people who play the strategy games, that's teaching to look
3907620	3912020	beyond an immediate circle and look for long term effect. You
3912020	3915620	know, at least that's what where I'm going with this part of it.
3915620	3917820	Those are just inferences that I've made.
3917860	3921140	I think many of us that grew up on video games played a variety
3921140	3923380	of games, you know, sure, we had our favorites, I'm sure, but we
3923380	3926220	played a probably a variety of games. I think it goes back to
3926300	3929420	you were talking about that, you know, the tasks are something
3929420	3932340	that these kids are doing, and that their brain is kind of
3932340	3934740	constantly moving, because the games are giving them these
3934740	3937300	different tasks. And probably, again, depending on the type of
3937300	3940420	game you're playing, it's in cases, yeah, is what sort of
3940420	3944300	tasks it is. Whereas I would bet the control group that didn't
3944300	3948700	play the games, probably was watching television, and just
3948740	3951940	absorbing whatever was being put at them. And there was no task
3951940	3953900	to complete, you're just absorbing someone else's story.
3954140	3956460	Now, if you want to argue difference between ambient and
3956460	3959700	active, well, now, if you want to argue that maybe kids were
3959700	3963820	going out and playing sports instead, or something like that,
3963820	3965740	then that's all fine and good. And that's probably really good
3965740	3968540	for someone's physical health. But you know, a good a good
3968540	3972260	coordination, sure, reflex time, but it's there's not a variety
3972300	3975460	of tasks the way there are in games. And you know that between
3975460	3979380	the strategy game and the the that would exercise your brain,
3979460	3981220	you're certainly getting the physical activity, but not the
3982020	3986100	I think, while there is a cognitive element that's
3986100	3990020	involved in playing a game, usually it's not the player
3990020	3995860	that's having to make the plan. It's the coach or whoever who's
3995980	4000300	looking over the thing, making the plan, and sending out the
4000300	4003340	players to do that. Now the player has to execute whatever
4003340	4006100	task that they're doing. And yes, there's going to be, you
4006100	4010820	know, like, I'll just use like, baseball, there's aiming,
4010820	4013780	there's spatial awareness, there's force, there's knowing
4013780	4016620	how to a little bit of physics involved in it, in it with
4016620	4021380	hitting directions and whatnot. But in the end, they have a
4021380	4023980	particular task that they're executing, and they're limited
4023980	4026500	within that task that they're executing. Same with football,
4026500	4030420	if you're given a play, you know that your job is to cover this
4030420	4034660	person's ass while they run with a ball, or your job is to take
4034660	4037900	said ball and run like hell and make sure that no one pounds
4037900	4038700	your head into the dirt.
4039460	4042060	I would think even with an individualized sport like
4042060	4045140	tennis, it's still, you know, you still have a tennis coach,
4045140	4047660	but who's teaching you how to play it, but you're kind of
4047660	4049620	going through the same motion, right? You're going through the
4049620	4051660	same motions, pretty much. And again,
4051660	4054180	Your end goal is the same every single time that you do it.
4054220	4057740	And I'm not knocking physical sports for kids. That's fine. As
4057740	4059500	long as you know, it's a positive environment and
4059500	4062020	everything, because we've all seen some scary shit at Little
4062020	4064900	League games. But as long as it's a positive and supportive
4064900	4067260	environment, I'm all for it. Because you know, I think a good
4067260	4069820	mix is probably the best, but I'm just kind of illustrating.
4069820	4073420	It doesn't have the same level of cognitive stimulation.
4073540	4080260	The mental. Yeah, so it's just interesting. So I'm glad science
4080420	4082740	is out there to prove. I'm sure that won't matter to a lot of
4082740	4085260	people, but it's nice to still have some of the science and
4085260	4086580	studies behind it for sure.
4086740	4089060	It absolutely is. I'm going to send it to my mom and tell her
4089060	4090060	this is why I'm smart.
4090460	4092780	There. There you go. And I think that's what most people will be
4092780	4094940	doing with this article this week. Those of us like us who
4094940	4095860	grew up on games and
4095860	4096740	Hey, Mom, look,
4096780	4099780	we're told they were gonna rot our brain, or that I told violent
4099780	4103100	video games, we're gonna, you know, unwind us or whatever it
4103100	4103940	was. So
4104700	4108820	now I'm, I think that one other thing that that I would like to
4108820	4111940	see, and it's too late to do it now. Because I mean, of course,
4111940	4115660	those times are long past. But I would be interested to see how
4115740	4120500	earlier types of gaming, like, you know, growing up a pinball.
4121460	4125340	I, I don't think that and now keep in mind, I love pinball. I
4125340	4129220	love to play pinball. I think that you still have some of that
4129220	4134460	still same limited strategy that you wouldn't have in say, going
4134460	4137340	through a game where you're solving multiple puzzles and
4137340	4141860	working through a narrative. Yeah. And I hate to say it,
4141860	4144220	because I mean, there's there's some new pinball tables out
4144220	4147020	there that have a lot of good challenges and everything. But
4147060	4150780	in the end, it's flipper plus ball, you know, meets target.
4152620	4156020	All right. Well, let's move on to a game that has a lot of
4156020	4157580	people thinking right, Loki.
4159300	4165180	Yeah. So, you know, I think we've always been wondering if
4165180	4168300	there's gonna be a sequel for Death Stranding coming. And I
4168300	4170980	kind of figured that if there was going to be a sequel coming
4170980	4175340	for that, then I mean, we're gonna find out about it with
4175340	4180820	some sort of event starring Jeff Keighley. You know, I mean, we
4180820	4183940	have one right around the corner. So it only makes sense
4183940	4186860	if there was going to be an announcement that that might be
4186860	4191580	coming. But apparently, it's been sort of acknowledged by
4191580	4199020	Norman Reedus. Basically saying that, um, yeah, I don't know if
4199020	4204180	he's, you know, he's necessarily confirmed it, but
4204220	4208060	there's a lot of like, weird, like, tweets and stuff going
4208060	4212380	around, like, Hideo Kojima has got playing looks like action
4212380	4215460	figures and stuff like that. And then of course, you know, he
4215460	4218100	said, you know, quick, okay, so you've got a book going on,
4218100	4221220	you've got final season coming out, and then a spin off, and
4221220	4227260	you're filming Death Stranding, the video game. I'm saying, you
4227260	4229940	know, we just started the second one. And this was, I
4229940	4233900	believe, in an interview that he was talking about for the
4233940	4237420	upcoming book, The Ravaged. So he was talking about like the
4237420	4239340	stuff that he's working on right now. So
4240100	4243500	so he slipped. I mean, a lot of a lot of these pre work has to
4243500	4246780	be done in advance. He slipped. They're not going to sue Norman
4246780	4249300	Reedus over a broken NDA. They're not going to do it like
4249300	4251780	he probably didn't mean to spoil it. But he probably Norman
4251780	4254140	Reedus probably doesn't follow the industry because he's he's
4254140	4256140	an actor trying to do movies and that type of stuff. He
4256180	4258180	probably doesn't follow the industry close enough to know
4258380	4260260	there's a very specific timetable when you announce
4260260	4262900	things that it does. So he slipped up, you made a mistake,
4262900	4266780	whatever, like, it's just it. And nothing will happen to him
4266780	4269620	as a result. And you know, ultimately, now it's just okay,
4269620	4271660	well, that secrets out. But I would
4273420	4277380	I love the response. So once this news kind of came out,
4278420	4283020	Hideo Kojima posts, go to your private room, my friend. He has
4283020	4287620	like a bat, a picture of the bat with barbed wire. Yeah, yeah.
4287660	4288180	Yeah.
4289780	4294820	So Kojima basically confirming it. But what's weird about I'm
4294820	4297180	not shocked that there's a sequel to Death Stranding. I'm
4297180	4301220	not shocked about that. But a lot of talk with Kojima lately
4301220	4304140	has been what is he working on now? Isn't he working on a
4304140	4306580	scary game? Isn't there something kind of new that he's
4306580	4310700	doing? And you know, the IP silent hell that won't go away.
4310860	4314940	It would be weird if like all this time, it just turns out,
4314980	4317500	oh, he's working on a Death Stranding sequel. I'm not saying
4317500	4319540	that's bad, because Death Stranding was an interesting
4319540	4323020	game. And it came out at a really good time for that sort
4323020	4325300	of story. But it just it's just it would just be a weird
4325300	4328620	conclusion to all this Kojima mystery of the last few years.
4329940	4333780	It would be a little unusual. But also, you mean, what do we
4333780	4336860	do nowadays in the game industry? We we make sequels.
4336980	4340420	True. So well, and that's not to say Kojima can't work on two
4340420	4342620	things at once. And especially when we're talking about
4342620	4347260	designing for what is now current gen systems. I'm sure
4347260	4350300	they have to get all the motion capture of Norman Reedus locked
4350300	4354900	in way sooner rather than later to get him rendered. And in the
4354900	4357860	game, you know, if he's the primary character, again, they
4357860	4360860	got to get all that work done. I mean, this game could still be
4360900	4364660	years out. And he's involved now. Absolutely. There's no
4364660	4367740	reason why that can't be the case. So it's not to say Kojima
4367740	4371100	can't work on two games at once. It's just, I don't think
4371100	4374580	this was the one they plan to announce at Keeley's next event.
4374900	4381140	So probably not. Yeah. Let's see Questbuster in chat says on the
4381140	4384780	other hand, Reedus might be playing Kojima's long PR game
4384780	4389020	like a damn fiddle. Maybe suggesting that there was a
4389020	4391780	little bit of malice, maybe playful malice. I don't think
4392540	4395220	yeah, Reedus is in the interest of actually hurting Kojima.
4395260	4399780	He's still not dressing up in full was it full body cast
4400220	4401180	makeup again.
4402580	4406100	But you know, I could see that maybe he trolls Kojima by
4406100	4407980	announcing it early because like, what's gonna happen? What
4407980	4411140	are you gonna do? So what people know about the game early? So
4411140	4415340	what when you get do stab me? Yeah, big game get sequel. Tell
4415340	4417900	me something I don't know. But I think for a lot of us that you
4417900	4421540	know, follow the releases about. It's just I think I guess I can
4421540	4424260	really only speak for myself. I'm surprised that Death
4424300	4428220	Stranding sequel would be next potentially. I just thought
4428260	4431660	there was something else happening. But there's it's it's
4431660	4435580	also very possible something else got canceled. It's happened
4435580	4443380	before. So who knows? All right, moving on. Let's talk about what
4443380	4447420	I think is very interesting with this whole PlayStation. You
4447420	4451460	know, the PlayStation Plus is getting redone. And we actually
4451460	4453460	know what some of the PlayStation Plus releases are
4453460	4455660	going to be we know what some of the classics are that when
4455660	4459500	the service rolls out in on June 13. For the Americas. I think
4459500	4461940	it's even sooner for Japan. I think Japan gets it this
4461940	4466180	weekend. So we know some of the classics. So we know that for
4466180	4470140	example, PlayStation one and PlayStation portable. These are
4470140	4473500	the classics you will get if you subscribe to that highest tier.
4474460	4480260	ape escape, hotshots golf, IQ intelligent cube, jumping flash,
4480340	4484700	siphon filter, super stardust portable, Mr. driller tech and
4484700	4491340	two worms world party worms are Armageddon. And that's it 10
4491340	4497340	games. Now, I'm not saying that list is bad by any means. But I
4497340	4500820	know when I heard this news, I was like, wait a damn minute.
4501060	4504220	Didn't they say in their press release, they were going to have
4504220	4510140	up to 350 classic games that were playable. Now, sure, I see
4510140	4512980	that there are PlayStation two games and PlayStation three
4512980	4519300	games. Sure, you add it all up, it's maybe 50. It's not 350. So
4519300	4522860	I guess maybe it's a long game. And many people on Twitter when
4522860	4525300	I made a sassy tweet about this many people on Twitter were
4525300	4529500	quick to correct me and say, this is a first look list. This
4529500	4533500	is a preliminary list. This is not the finalized list. Okay,
4533600	4539020	counterpoint. This is out next week in Japan. The time for
4539260	4544220	first look is past. This is now the time for a deep look, an
4544220	4547340	intimate look a further look, because this is what they're
4547340	4552380	trying to get people to buy. And if it's 10 games, that's not my
4552380	4555540	first now here's where I'm going to start to kind of scale back
4555540	4559820	my reaction. Because when I heard this list on Monday, I was
4559820	4564540	like, that is sad. That's sadder than what Nintendo launched
4564540	4567460	their switch online with and you see how much shit they get for
4567460	4573420	that, right? That is the 10 for the PS one. That's sad. But then
4573420	4578340	a second part of this came out where I'm like, Oh, this is why
4578380	4583380	it's only 10. And that is that the PS classic games are going
4583380	4587620	to now have trophies. Remember, they didn't have trophies near
4587620	4593820	the PlayStation one. But a tweet where Ben studio shared a clip
4594140	4599140	of siphon filter showed a new trophy and explosive start
4599380	4604620	available in the PlayStation one classic. And Ben studio actually,
4604740	4607260	the design manager there, Eric Jensen said in a tweet
4607260	4611460	responding to a fan, he helped out with a few of the trophies,
4611580	4614980	mostly naming. And there's apparently a platinum trophy
4614980	4617540	called excellent work agent, which assumably would be what
4617540	4621900	you get when you unlock all of the other trophies. Ah, so this
4621900	4625660	explains now it's just trophies. And you know, some people may
4625660	4628540	feel stronger about trophies than others. But now I
4628540	4631300	understand why it's taken so long for them to because now
4631300	4634460	they're actually having they're not just slapping an emulator on
4634460	4638100	it and putting it out on the service Nintendo. But they're
4638100	4641820	actually going back and trying to add more flags for trophies
4641820	4645900	and maybe other stuff too. We'll see when it comes out. Maybe some
4645900	4648100	types of filtering. I don't know. But I'm not really
4648140	4652460	counting on any of that. I still think it was wrong of them to
4652460	4657860	promote 350 games. Even if that is their plan to get there in
4657860	4661220	three years. That's not where they're at this week when it
4661220	4667100	launches in Japan. So I don't know. We'll see. I don't know
4667140	4670700	when you hear about all this. The 10 games and all this stuff.
4670860	4673500	I'm looking at chat now. Finally, Bobby Blackwell says up
4673500	4677580	to 350 games. Yeah. Okay. I think we all know the use of up
4677580	4682860	to was a little little bit of a stretch here. Just a tad. Just a
4682860	4686660	tad. Um, Mike Deaf says trophies for PlayStation One games is
4686660	4692460	pretty cool. Yeah, it is pretty cool. Let's see. And Mike Deaf
4692460	4695100	says we're also not paying around $80 a year for the
4695100	4698300	PlayStation Plus service. And not to mention that even Nintendo
4698300	4703020	was criticized for having so little games in the service. I
4703020	4706020	thought you were paying $80 for the highest level PlayStation
4706020	4709020	Plus. Isn't it something like 120 a year or something like
4709020	4712980	that? So I don't know. Anyway, I could be wrong. I don't have all
4712980	4715740	that. The PlayStation Plus, unfortunately, it's a little
4715740	4717900	complicated. And I don't have the chart in front of me right
4717900	4720700	now that shows how much every level costs. But I'm not I'm not
4720700	4724020	sure these 10 games are worth it to me to get the highest level
4724020	4727460	of PlayStation Plus. I was already a little bit like a but
4727460	4730740	now after seeing this list, I'm like, Nah, I don't want it. I
4730740	4731260	don't need it.
4732860	4735660	It's just our stupid PlayStation Now stuff. I just don't I'm not
4735660	4736900	interested in that stuff.
4738540	4743740	Yeah. Dark Sakura trophies. Do they matter? Is it incentive? Or
4743740	4748340	nah? No. No. And I think that just depends on the gamer. Some
4748340	4752100	people love the trophy chase the trophy hunt. I would love to see
4752100	4755220	something like trophies in the Nintendo collection. Not that I
4755220	4757460	would necessarily want to chase them all. But I think it would
4757460	4760700	be fun to have like your little digital certificate, your
4760700	4764340	digital badge, your little proof that yes, I beat Metroid without
4764340	4766780	using codes or whatever. Kid Icarus will be even bigger one.
4766780	4769460	I beat Kid Icarus without using codes or whatever it is. I think
4769460	4774660	that would be fun. But I also don't count on Nintendo to get
4775260	4777740	by that there was another Reggie interview that came out where
4777740	4780100	somebody asked him why did Nintendo take so damn long to
4780100	4783180	come to the table with online? And it's the answer most of us
4783180	4787380	had assumed for many years. Japan didn't understand that
4787420	4790620	that that it was more of a need in the US and Europe is basically
4791340	4794580	extremely paraphrasing what Reggie said. You can go look at
4794580	4797500	that up for yourself if you want. But yeah, just on a
4797500	4801220	related note, continue to drag their feet on that, I guess.
4804180	4806380	Mike Deft says, Yeah, I think it's over 100. But it's
4806380	4809300	different in Mexico and Latin America or Mike Deft is that
4809540	4811660	than it is for the US because they don't have PlayStation now
4811660	4814980	there. And that is true is that, you know, a lot of countries,
4815220	4818180	notably Australia, aren't going to have the same type of
4818180	4820420	PlayStation Plus because they can't do the cloud streaming.
4820620	4823460	For whatever reason, it's just not built to support that the
4823500	4826140	infrastructure of Sony in those countries or whatever.
4827260	4827820	Interesting.
4828860	4833700	All right. Meanwhile, there's a very interesting headline that's
4833700	4835420	getting a lot of attention Dark Sakura.
4837580	4842300	Well, um, we actually brought this up kind of last week, I
4842300	4848100	think talking about Xbox and how they're selling in Japan. And it
4848100	4851220	turns out that for the first time in eight years, the Xbox
4851260	4856620	has outsold PlayStation in Japan this past week. The Xbox Series
4856660	4868140	S alone outsold the PS5 and PS5 digital edition by about 3,
4868180	4876940	3,800 units. So however, I mean, it's it's a rare occurrence. And
4876940	4879860	I think that some of this has to do with system availability and
4879860	4887100	whatnot. So one other thing also to keep in mind, too, is that it
4887100	4891140	hadn't had the best support by Microsoft in in Japan before, but
4891140	4898020	now they're having a lot more successful series of sales with
4898020	4905740	this particular system. Simply because of the rollout of Game
4905740	4912900	Pass for both console and PC in Japan in April 2020. So they've
4912900	4917180	seen a lot more player activity than any other time in Xbox
4917220	4921940	history in Japan. And that they're also thinking that the
4921940	4926700	acquisition of Tango Gameworks is going to be a very big step
4926700	4931660	toward achieving a better market share in Japan. Phil Spencer is
4931660	4935980	actually saying that they intend to take better care of Japanese
4935980	4942820	players and and really make sure that they have, you know, they
4942820	4945820	have a place in that aspect of the gaming industry that their
4945820	4948020	their needs are being catered to that games are coming out that
4948020	4953660	they'd want to play. I think it's I think it's good. I mean,
4954100	4959620	yeah, it could be due to availability, but it is what it
4959620	4961140	is. It's actually worth mentioning.
4961180	4964420	Yeah, no, for sure. You know, and last week there. Yeah,
4964420	4969660	right. This topic came up last week. There was no fact behind
4969660	4972940	it to back it up until what we have here tonight. But we had a
4972940	4975380	caller on the show last week who said, you know, I was saying
4975380	4977980	the Xbox is a non factor in Japan. And that's just the way
4977980	4980100	it is. And somebody said, No, it's wrong. It's selling. Yeah,
4980100	4984220	I was wrong. I commit that I whoops. And this this headline
4984220	4987340	sure, sure made a humble person out of me. It is what it is.
4987500	4992660	Now, I, again, I think this just makes a nice headline because,
4993020	4995820	yes, and I agree with Zen monkey 11. And Chad is saying, that's
4995820	4998660	because people can't find PlayStation fives. It's not like
4998660	5003260	they sold, I think a better, a more impactful headline, I guess
5003260	5007540	would have been if the Xbox sold a lot of units, you know, out
5007540	5009540	of but they didn't, they still didn't sell all things
5009540	5013980	considered that many units, but I didn't think they were hardly
5013980	5017100	selling any. And apparently, Microsoft is starting to catch
5017100	5019940	on in Japan a little more again. And now you kind of
5019940	5023380	brought up game pass. I know undertale recently got
5023400	5026260	localized to Japanese audiences, I think. So I think there's just
5026260	5029580	a lot of stuff now that probably game passes leveraging. And I
5029580	5034820	think that it's interesting that it's the Xbox s, and not the x.
5034940	5039780	So it's, it's probably that lower price for the s, combined
5039780	5043020	with the fact that it's a game pass system. And it's it's
5043020	5046780	turning some heads in Japan. I still don't think it's, you
5046780	5049460	know, I think we put the lifetime sales next to Sony and
5049460	5053500	Nintendo, it's still not where you know, a competitive system
5053500	5057540	ought to be. But this headline certainly shows that there's
5057540	5061420	potential there for Microsoft to grow. And maybe all is not lost,
5061740	5065620	I would say with Microsoft in Japan, as I had assumed last
5065620	5070480	week. So props to Phil Spencer on that victory and that
5070480	5074700	headline, even if maybe a chip shortage was to thank for it. In
5074700	5077540	part still, I think the fact that they sold as many as they
5077540	5082100	did is still a long way from where they were even what 510
5082100	5087100	years ago. All right. Well, moving on, Loki.
5088380	5093960	Yep. So speaking about Xbox, there's this cool new patent
5093980	5100020	that is coming out, talking about how I don't know if this
5100020	5103860	necessarily goes back to when they announced the Xbox one and
5103860	5105700	that type of stuff. But remember, that was supposed to
5105700	5108700	be almost like a digital only console at one time, but now
5108860	5110780	they have a way that they're saying they're going to be able
5110780	5117820	to validate your physical media to unlock digital copies of the
5117820	5121220	game. So if I have like a physical version of, you know,
5121220	5125160	Grand Theft Auto four, something like that, then somehow, it'll
5125160	5129500	be able to scan that disk and authenticate a digital copy of
5129500	5133460	the game for me since you know, they may in the future not be
5133460	5136980	able to play those games on the drives that they have, like the
5136980	5139180	Blu-ray drives might not be able to handle it or something like
5139180	5143220	that. So I'm not necessarily sure how it's going to work. But
5144260	5145460	sounds interesting.
5146500	5148540	I can tell you it's gonna work. Jason outlined it a little bit
5148540	5151680	in the intro. Well, we don't know for sure. But I'm, I would
5151680	5155100	guess absolutely, they're going to leverage Windows 11. They're
5155100	5157260	going to leverage Windows 11. And what they're going to do is
5157260	5159200	they're going to build something into that that will decrypt the
5159200	5162380	Xbox disks the same way the system does. And it'll know Yep,
5162380	5165140	this is a valid copy of this disk. And while you're signed
5165140	5167900	into this account here on your PC, and the disk is in the
5167900	5170300	drive, we know you have the game and now it's available on your
5170300	5174380	Xbox in your account. That's, that's, I would bet that's what
5174380	5176540	they're going to do is they're going to leverage, you know, the
5176540	5179100	market share of Windows 11 to make that happen.
5180180	5183920	Hope it's not I hope I don't need a disk drive in my computer
5183920	5185020	to be able to
5186380	5188620	true because we're starting to see less and less of those are
5189500	5194180	as most nobody has, you know, optical drives anymore. I still
5194180	5194820	have one.
5195020	5201460	You would be surprised. Trust me. I hear about it all the
5201460	5204060	time. There's trust me, there's annoying
5204060	5208420	still a lot of people that kind of rely on it for I have these
5208420	5213180	old photo CDs, or I have drivers that you know, what if I don't
5213180	5215620	have internet and I need something, you know, like, the
5215620	5218300	drive now is just for backup purposes, even though Yeah, I
5218300	5221980	guess a USB drive can also be, you know, a big thing. But you
5221980	5227900	can also get a drive, you can get a DVD drive, that is USB, or
5227900	5229940	Blu ray drive that is USB if you really wanted it.
5230780	5234380	So but without outing where I work,
5236260	5240180	I get plenty of I need to burn this Blu ray disc, I need to
5240180	5244520	burn this DVD, and it needs to be a video disc. And there are a
5244520	5249040	lot of people who are still using it as an active media
5249040	5249800	trade source.
5251720	5254760	A lot of folks in chat are kind of lighting up about like Bobby
5254760	5257600	Blackwell says you can't get a gaming PC case with a drive bay
5257600	5261640	anymore. DJRMS says I want to buy a new PC case, but so many
5261640	5264240	new and fancy ones do not have spots for optical drives. Well,
5264240	5266560	I guess I'm giving away how old my computer is. I am looking to
5266560	5270480	replace it. It's a few years old at this point. But yeah, and not
5270480	5272680	that an optical drive is something I'm looking for. But
5272680	5275400	this is a very interesting patent that might change that
5275400	5277800	conversation a little bit where I'm like, Oh, maybe I want an
5277800	5281200	external USB drive. I mean, we'll see. And then someone else
5281200	5284040	in chat, I think as Joe and under Matt said, not gonna lie, I
5284040	5288200	wish Sony had this patent. It's not to say Sony couldn't do it.
5288240	5290980	They'd have to pay Microsoft to do it at this point, but they
5290980	5295760	could do it. And you might kind of laugh at that prospect. But
5296320	5299760	how does Microsoft have the Blu ray player? Because guess who
5299760	5303080	has a stake in Blu ray right now. So Microsoft has to pay
5303120	5306440	Sony to have a Blu ray player on their device. There could be an
5306440	5308400	interesting exchange there. Hmm.
5308760	5312400	But bear in mind, though, a patent does not reflect reality.
5313000	5315860	That is true, too. There's patents for things all the time
5315880	5319000	that never end up happening. And yeah, lots of that stuff, or
5319000	5322600	they change significantly and so forth. Absolutely. But it is
5322600	5328120	I'll give you an example. Sega VR. Mm hmm. They had working
5328120	5332440	units never came out. Well, partly because they were causing
5332440	5336040	migraines because the sync between player movement and
5336240	5340720	backgrounds would disconnect and gave people seizures. But that's
5340720	5341240	another story.
5342760	5345880	Pod culture and chat says yeah, Microsoft back to the wrong
5345880	5349560	format in that war. I they didn't have a choice. You know,
5349560	5353320	again, Sony had a stake in Blu ray. So they weren't going to
5353320	5355520	especially you know, when it was about being that definitive
5355520	5359080	living room device, they were not going to use their pay their
5359080	5362820	competitor to they were going to leverage HD DVD. The mistake
5362820	5366960	Microsoft made was not having HDVD players in every single
5366960	5370600	Xbox that was that it was a separate accessory. That was the
5370600	5373600	problem because that's how PlayStation made DVDs as
5373600	5376400	impactful as they were is that they were on every PlayStation
5376400	5379160	two they sold was also a DVD player. And you got to think way
5379160	5383520	back that's how DVDs became the thing was the PS two. And then
5383520	5389080	how to Blu rays win that war PlayStation three. So it's Yep, I
5389080	5392380	think my I just say, you know, yeah, yeah, Microsoft did back
5392380	5395680	the wrong format. I would just say they didn't have a choice. I
5395680	5400800	think it's just the poorly timed implementation that didn't work.
5400800	5404960	And you know, and by the time it was about the Xbox one, while it
5404960	5408080	was done, the victor had been decided porn went to Blu ray and
5408080	5414940	it was over. So interesting, Bobby Blackwell says one of the
5414940	5418720	reasons they backed HD DVD was because they wanted both to
5418720	5422040	lose. So streaming and digital would win. Ah, that's also
5422040	5428920	clever to split the market. Perhaps. All right, let's move
5428920	5433200	on. Let's talk about a game I've played a little bit here in a
5433200	5438600	little bit thereof. It's Pokemon go and Pokemon go who boy. You
5438600	5441320	know, I feel like every other month on the show, we're talking
5441320	5444480	about Niantic made a change and their player base doesn't like
5444480	5447520	it. Well, guess what? They did it again. They made another
5447520	5450840	change and the player base doesn't like it. And it has to
5450840	5455920	do with scaling back the remote raid passes. So they were giving
5455920	5458960	away remote raid Pat. Well, they weren't giving them away. But it
5458960	5460920	was they were giving away because they were doing these
5460960	5465960	one pokey coin bundles every week was giving you a remote
5465960	5468720	raid pass. I don't know when they started that. But it wasn't
5468720	5471400	more than a year ago. This wasn't something they started at
5471400	5474740	the beginning of the pandemic. But they started doing it about
5474740	5477800	a year ago, I would say is when they started giving away those
5477840	5479760	remote raid passes. And they said they were going to do it
5479760	5482960	every week in the in the bundles. Well, they're going to
5482960	5486160	stop. They're not going to give you remote raid passes for free
5486160	5489280	and bundles and or you know what I mean for one coin, which is
5489280	5497840	practically free. So that's gone. And as they did that, they
5497840	5502440	have upped the cost of the remote raid passes in a bundle
5502440	5506280	anyway, most people were by a one remote raid pass will cost
5506280	5510880	you 100 coins. Three used to cost you 250. But you got that
5510880	5514920	discount, right? Guess what three now cost you 300. So there
5514920	5519200	is no point to buying those raid passes in bulk. And that was a
5519200	5521900	change. They just made it. It's already live in the game. It's a
5521900	5527360	done deal. And yes, you can earn coins for free in the game. If
5527360	5533040	you do the gym meta, but you can only earn 50 coins a day. So you
5533040	5535840	don't you can't remote raid every day. You can only remote
5535840	5540680	raid twice a week, basically. So or, you know, once every other
5540680	5544480	day, I don't know anyway, what they're also trying to do. And
5544520	5547720	basically, why is it that they're doing this? Because
5548520	5551440	America has decided COVID is over and they're just following
5551440	5555920	suit. Notice how I phrase I didn't say COVID is over I said
5555920	5561720	America decided COVID is over. There's a big difference. Niantic
5561720	5567040	is also trying to push people to raid in person again, by getting
5567080	5571400	the rewards for in person rating to be sweeter. So you get more
5571400	5576440	not just rare candy when you do those raids, but you get rare XL
5576440	5579800	candies, which are very hard to come by. I don't think anybody's
5579800	5583640	upset with that change. Plus, you know, it Pokemon go rating,
5583800	5587000	either everybody's sitting in their own car and doing it that
5587000	5589860	way. Or at least it's outdoors. And you don't have to really be
5589860	5592120	close to people to do it. You know, I've done plenty of my
5592600	5595480	remote or excuse me, plenty of my own Pokemon raid in the day.
5595640	5598400	And I would see even in the era of COVID. It's a pretty safe
5598400	5602320	thing to do compared to most things. However, I just think
5602320	5604520	what kind of sucks here. And I think what a lot of you know,
5604520	5609000	the players don't like is that it's not that they're just
5609040	5612120	adding something. It's that they're also taking something
5612120	5615400	away with no warning. I think if they have just added the
5615400	5618240	incentives to get out there and do it in person, then they would
5618240	5620160	motivate more people to go out there and do it in person,
5620160	5624320	especially the XL candy, but to take away with these remote
5624320	5627240	raids. And I think it's just a matter of time before they flip
5627240	5630480	that switch if they didn't already. But remote raids are
5630480	5632960	supposed to be weaker. You're not supposed to be able to do
5632960	5635920	as much damage in remote raids. So even though today you might
5635920	5638600	be able to take out what a tapu fini I think is the latest
5639200	5641840	legendary that's in the game. You can take that out with four
5641840	5643760	people in a remote raid. You're not supposed to be able to do
5643760	5646560	that. It's supposed to be weaker. And I imagine it's just
5646560	5650760	a matter of time before they flip that switch too. So yeah,
5650840	5653880	and Mike Defton chat says yeah, Niantic lack of communication
5653880	5655840	toward the player base is what hurts the game more than
5655840	5659000	anything. And this is the part where we sit here going. They
5659000	5664920	just supposedly learn their lesson. Like not even three
5664920	5668200	months ago, when we had this whole discussion about changing
5668200	5672120	the radius of the pokey stop, and they they tried to shrink it
5672120	5675440	back to 40, which would match what Pikmin and Ingress have.
5675680	5678880	But again, because you're taking something away that you put in
5678880	5681680	there and you I think they had kind of said would always be
5681680	5685720	there. The player base lost their fucking mind and held
5685720	5689520	their feet to the fire over it. And they had to reverse course
5689520	5692920	and say, we'll listen in the future. We'll listen. Well, this
5693080	5696680	just shows they're not listening. And that's what's
5696680	5701360	incredibly frustrating for some people. Now, I don't know how
5701360	5703640	many people are going to go to the great lengths that are
5703640	5706520	necessary to really make your point and delete the fucking
5706520	5711520	game. If it's that. And I will say our own Pokemon nerd resident
5711520	5714200	nerd Shane who's come on the show several times. He's told me
5714200	5716600	he's deleted the game from his phone and he's done with it.
5716600	5722880	Like between this, the reduced incense spawns living in a rural
5722880	5726000	area. He's just like, Pokemon go just isn't for me. And he
5726000	5731200	deleted it off his phone. So I mean, it'll take a lot of people
5731200	5734520	to do that. I think for Niantic to really shape shift their
5734560	5741240	shift course and do that whole thing. So but in the meantime,
5741240	5745880	let's see what are some other comments here? Oh, there are new
5745880	5747920	social features that are supposed to be coming to the
5747920	5752840	game in the next few months. Oh, yeah. I got an invite to a
5752840	5757000	Niantic social app. So it's interesting because the whole
5757000	5760680	social stuff is already built into ingress. But I guess
5760680	5763120	because I'm an ingress player, maybe they even know I'm a
5763120	5766160	heavy user. I don't know. I got invited through because you
5766160	5769680	know, it's not it's not quote unquote, easy to beta stuff on
5769680	5772480	an apple compared to Android because on Android, they just
5772480	5775440	kind of put it up as a beta but an apple you have to be invited
5775560	5778600	by the publisher to something called test flight in order to
5778600	5781920	be able to attest and that's what I got through Niantic is a
5781920	5786120	test flight version of the Niantic social app. Now, they
5786120	5789760	didn't make me sign anything. So I tweeted about it. I was like,
5789760	5793680	here's what it looks like. But and then they added a splash
5793680	5796480	screen to the game that says reminder, this is confidential.
5796480	5800000	And you're not just put anything out there on apps. And
5800000	5802760	I'm like, Okay, look, if you want to know what the Niantic
5802760	5807760	social is, download ingress because it is completely in the
5807760	5816160	ingress game already, completely in the game already. So it's I
5816160	5819080	don't know what they're keeping so secret about this app. I also
5819080	5822120	don't know why they're building a separate app for it, and not
5822120	5826760	just putting it into Pokemon go. But somebody I was talking to
5826760	5832720	had a really good take on why is that maybe the Pokemon company
5832720	5835760	won't allow it. That you know, there's only because you know,
5835760	5837920	the Pokemon company kind of has to own a lot of the stuff that
5837920	5841320	goes the Pokemon go. And maybe they're not allowing Niantic to
5841320	5843640	put their social app in there. So they have to kind of do their
5843640	5846360	own thing. I'm going to try to I'm trying to show you without
5846360	5849760	like giving away where I live. Okay, I zoomed way in so you
5849760	5853120	can't really let me turn the map a little bit. Okay, I zoomed
5853120	5855880	way in here. So all you have to I'll show you the bottom half
5855880	5859400	the screen, all you have to do if you hit the little button in
5859400	5862160	ingress, and you go to the social, which is right in the
5862160	5866600	middle. And keep in mind, I'm not breaking any rules. I'm not
5866600	5874200	showing their app or anything I'm showing. There is oops, I
5874200	5876760	got to make sure I'm not zoomed in too far on the dot. I don't
5876760	5878320	care if it shows the neighborhood that I don't want
5878320	5881640	it to show exact house. There's the Niantic social app. It's
5881640	5884360	built in ingress. So if you want to know what's coming, just
5884360	5890200	download ingress. It's right there in the game. So um, and
5890200	5892560	why is Niantic doing that? Probably because they're seeing
5892560	5896120	how much of their community is going to discord and slack and
5896120	5898960	telegram and group me and all of those apps. And they're like,
5898960	5903280	Hey, we want to have a little piece of that. So there it is.
5904360	5907160	Mike Defton chat says this is actually really good for stuff
5907160	5912600	like that. The group I was in for ingress used to use Google
5912600	5914720	Hangouts back in the day. Yeah, back in the day until they
5914720	5917680	retired that but yeah, oh yeah, I used to love Google Hangouts
5917680	5921280	for that stuff. Mike Defton chat says the social app looks like a
5921280	5924280	discord server and it looks so bad pretty much it looks like
5924280	5929120	just a pretty cheap knockoff of discord. So I don't I don't know
5929120	5932880	like what special thing is going to really draw people to the
5932880	5937040	app, but we'll see. So anyway, Mike Defton says they use
5937040	5941000	Facebook Messenger where they're at. Interesting. All right,
5941000	5944600	anyway. That's what they're doing in Pokemon Go. Will they
5944600	5948520	reverse the remote raid price change? Probably not if people
5948520	5952960	don't stop buying them. So if you if you are pissed off about
5952960	5957080	these changes, you have to stop buying remote raid passes.
5958320	5961280	That's the only way this is going to change. Tapu Fini can
5961280	5964040	even be shiny anyway. I don't know why people will people
5964040	5967880	aren't rating him. I've gotten to raid him once with a remote
5967880	5971600	raid pass. And this this is the part that pisses me off. Then he
5971600	5975240	ran away. That's the part that I like I connected with every
5975240	5978680	single ball and the fucker still ran away. That's what that's the
5978680	5982520	enraging part. I don't you know if it's 100 coins to do it,
5982520	5987440	whatever. But I literally got nothing for doing it. Except some
5987440	5990560	stardust and thanks for playing. Silly
5990560	5991960	and frustration. Don't forget that part.
5992000	5994600	Yes, I got frustration. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome.
5995400	5998560	Speaking of frustration, let's talk about some old school video
5998560	6000880	games because I you know what a lot of those were really
6000880	6001560	frustrating.
6012480	6016400	Now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive
6016400	6019840	into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
6020200	6022960	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6024160	6028600	And this is a very unique kind of pick for tonight, isn't it?
6029360	6033800	It is. So and I do hope that you skip around a little bit in the
6033800	6036840	video. Sure. I meant to do an edited version. That's okay. I'll
6036840	6041240	skip that a little bit. But I picked a Bobo's Big Adventure,
6042320	6047440	which was a freeware parody flash game. It came out January
6047440	6052120	11th, 2012 to play on any browser that would support
6052120	6057480	flash. So the whole the basically the point is, is that
6057680	6066160	you are a Bobo and you're trying to rescue your son. What was his
6066160	6070960	name? Like a boy boy, I think was his name. That's cute. Yeah.
6071760	6076080	But at any rate, you have to go through like different video
6076080	6080440	games with like different characters mixed around. And so
6080440	6085160	each of the sub games have different names. You have Double
6085160	6091760	Drabobo, Super Mabobo, Urban Chabobo, Zelda Bobo, Balloona
6091760	6097960	Bobo, Pro Rabobo, Mega Mabobo, and Contra Bobo and Puncha
6098280	6102440	Bobo. So you have to use your directional keys to do your
6102440	6108400	movement, you know, A and S are different actions. So like, like
6108400	6112400	for example, the first one you're going through, and you
6112400	6115560	know, beating people up, there's a Goomba that shows up, you know.
6118040	6123000	All of the levels are a single level except for Contra Bobo. I
6123000	6126800	mean, because Contra is like that. But yeah, you have to
6126800	6131200	rescue a Bobo. That's his name, a Bobo, who gets, you know,
6131200	6136080	beaten up in like the beginning of Double Dragon. And then you
6136080	6140720	go through the different places until you end with Puncha Bobo
6140720	6146640	where you run into Doc from Punch Out. And big spoiler,
6146680	6150600	Little Mac is the bad guy. And then you have to decapitate him
6150600	6159440	with a Power Glove. But it was all a dream. So it references so
6159440	6164040	many different games in there. It's pretty funny. But the game
6164040	6169240	actually started development in 2002 by the founder of iMakari,
6169240	6172560	Roger Barr, who wanted to make it his first full length Flash
6172560	6176360	game, and you know, show his favorite NES character a Bobo.
6177760	6180320	He worked with a programmer named Bain and they did some
6180320	6184600	early levels. It was delayed though for a while, especially
6184600	6187720	when a game that was very similar called Domo-kun's Angry Smash
6187720	6196520	Fest came out. But with the help of Nick Pasto of Pestoforce and
6196520	6204680	Pox of the Pox Box, they started over in 2006 and just went going
6204680	6207440	and tried to keep it along with, you know, standard NES
6207440	6212600	programming styles. And so they they mixed up the characters and
6212600	6215960	they did all kinds of different stuff. And then they had the
6215960	6220000	Flash version working and they revealed the first three levels
6220000	6224920	in 2009 at San Diego Comic Con with a NES controller, the way it
6224920	6231440	was intended. They had a cabinet, everything there. And then in
6231440	6235560	2010, they had a free to play cabinet with a sort with a NES
6235600	6241920	homage joystick area with artwork done by Jeff Bandelin of
6241920	6247960	Newgrounds. And then it got delayed again in 2011. And then
6247960	6254120	finally, a bar took the game with him on a comedy tour that he
6254120	6258440	was invited to go with. And then the trailer came out. And then
6258440	6261920	after a bunch of and basically the trailer was a response to
6261920	6267920	donations that they got. And then they started working on a
6267920	6271640	smaller game called a Bobo Small Adventure for anyone who donated.
6272240	6277800	And then on January 11, 2012, it was released on Newgrounds. And
6277800	6280800	it had a tutorial how to play it with a with a NES controller.
6281120	6284960	There's a downloadable version of the game. And they want to
6285000	6287520	actually keep having the cabinet out there. The game was pretty
6287520	6292200	well received. It went Newgrounds 2012 game of the year
6292200	6295960	game spy gave them some kudos. They called it the mother of all
6295960	6303400	8-bitch 8-bitch 8-bit. I try to say homage. The mother of all
6303440	6310160	8-bit homage flash video games. GameZone called it part parody
6310160	6315160	and part tribute. They said that it's the story isn't cheesy, but
6315160	6320440	is all kinds of badass. That is a quote. Wired said it was an 8-bit
6320440	6324480	parody done right. So all along the board and the thing the
6324480	6329480	biggest compliment is that Kishimoto Yoshihisa, who is the
6329480	6333760	creator of Double Dragon, said in a Polygon interview that he
6333760	6338480	was supportive and loved the game. You know, it's even been
6338560	6343960	given some of its parody even was said to have blurred the
6343960	6347840	line and go into the Dadaist expression. I thought that was
6347840	6352600	pretty funny. It is it does have some surreal moments like like
6352840	6358480	the whole part for me is the underwater level where a Bobo is
6358520	6362960	having to, you know, swim through the Mario level and then
6362960	6366280	there's like Bubble Man showing up and all kinds of interesting
6366280	6368440	enemies. It's just really trippy and out there.
6368880	6373320	I was reminded of Frog Fractions with how like not only
6373320	6377200	referential this game is to, you know, other video games, but
6377200	6380040	like how it's how it's really hodgepodge II, you know what I
6380040	6383080	mean? Like we just that's the point of it. Yeah, we just saw
6383080	6385080	that scene you were talking about here on the video. The
6385080	6389280	whole like, underwater level from Mario meets a Mega Man boss
6389280	6392280	meets the goonies meets like this is the balloon fight one.
6392320	6394160	Yeah, it's just like everything going on at once. Let me see.
6394160	6397120	I'm gonna fast forward to one more scene here. Oh, this looks
6397120	6400040	like pro wrestling where he's actually killing the wrestlers.
6400040	6401280	So that's that's something.
6401600	6405000	Yeah. I also really like the Mega Man one because he just
6405000	6407160	looks like his face has been photoshopped onto Mega Man's
6407160	6411760	body, which is a bit further up. I think that's like the third to
6411760	6415440	last one. And then there's the contra one and then punch the
6415440	6419400	punch out when there's before punch out there's what is this
6419400	6425960	is like Kirby. That's the contra one. But Oh, no, I can't show
6425960	6429240	this act deaf. This is you trying to kill Kirby with a
6429240	6435400	machine gun. That's bad. I'm pretty, pretty adorable. It is
6435400	6437800	pretty adorable. Like if Kirby is going to be a villain, this is
6437800	6438480	the way to do it.
6438520	6439600	That's awesome.
6440080	6443240	I agree with Bobby a drag race nest game called Super eight
6443240	6451880	bitch. Why are you our only hope? All right. Is that it? I
6451880	6455600	think that's it. There it is. Your class. It's Yeah, it's
6455600	6463560	pretty funny. Apparently, it's still available at sites.google.com
6463560	6468280	Um, and I wonder if this is Oh, yeah, I won't it won't play. You
6468280	6470600	have to have like some browser let you do flash. But I think
6470600	6474200	that someone out there if I remember right, I think someone
6474200	6478840	out there did sort of messify it. But I'll see if I can find
6478840	6485240	like the website. And yeah, I click on the website and it's
6485240	6490400	just all Nope. So once on the internet being emulated by
6490400	6493640	ruffle. So it has to load but you can still play it. I'll
6493640	6494280	link it in the chat.
6494840	6499800	All right. There it is your classic game of the week of
6499800	6507800	Bobo's big adventure. A parody game of sorts. That, you know,
6507800	6509880	this is kind of that's kind of fun to have, like, I guess,
6509880	6513480	which would really be a homebrew game as the classic game of the
6513480	6517960	week, but any game is eligible, right? So why not? And I and
6517960	6522520	released games. Yeah. So I think I did space fantasy zone
6522520	6527920	once you did you did the the one that was the polybius. That
6527920	6531800	one. You did oblivious. Yeah, that one wants to so. Yeah, why
6531800	6535480	not? So there it is classic game of the week. And that's actually
6535560	6539200	the classic that never happened. That's one that I would love to
6539200	6541880	go back and revisit because it is so funny. And it's like I
6541880	6544720	knew I knew of it back in the day, but I never I didn't spend
6544720	6547920	a lot of time with it. I didn't realize just how many layers of
6547920	6551400	references deep it went. But that's pretty good. That really
6551400	6554040	that does seem like a Loki game. Many people are in chatter
6554040	6556880	saying don't ask why why are Loki's the NES developer
6556880	6560080	remember? And I'm like, this is a Loki type of game. But I don't
6560080	6562920	know if Loki wants to make you gonna make us a super eight
6562920	6563440	bitch.
6564440	6565440	Oh, no.
6566200	6570400	He's got he's a Minecraft content maker.
6570440	6574280	I'm starting to work on visual novels. But I'm actually using a
6574280	6579400	visual novel tool to do my my DBD machinima.
6580440	6587720	I'm here. All right, let's move on to rapid fire news. I have my
6587720	6590480	hosting gigs on the side. That's my other thing. All right. Let's
6590480	6591160	get a rapid fire.
6591160	6592880	Nervous breakdown on the side. That's okay.
6592920	6598040	Yeah, it's true. Is that too? Oh, am I my my weight loss? I'm a
6598040	6601160	skinny. I have a side of skinny. All right, not really. But
6601800	6604880	closer than it was. All right. Let's travel around and check
6604880	6608720	out some other news going on in the industry. rapidly. That's
6608720	6611240	why it's rapid fire news. I'm going to step away real quick
6611240	6613480	because I need something to drink. So y'all keep rapid fire
6613480	6614440	moving. I'll be back.
6615280	6619480	So Epic Games is actually giving away Borderlands three for a
6619480	6624880	limited time. It's available now until 826.
6625120	6626800	I totally downloaded it last night.
6627000	6633080	Yeah, 8am Pacific time. So uh, yeah, you can check it out. Um,
6633120	6634920	it's a great game. Unfortunately, I already
6634920	6638520	purchased it when it came out. So can't get it for free, but
6638760	6641920	they're going to be doing some more giveaways here pretty soon
6642320	6646200	outside of this. But yeah, it's it's pretty nice. And then of
6646200	6648760	course, they're also having a sale going on right now as well.
6649560	6653920	Along with that, there's news about the current generation
6653920	6657480	version of the Witcher three, which is slated now to arrive at
6657480	6665240	the end of 2022. And it's been delayed a bit. But you know, I
6665240	6668640	know that they've been busy with fixing cyberpunk and stuff like
6668640	6674000	that. But now they shared via Twitter that it is coming out
6674000	6681880	q4 2022 on PlayStation five and Xbox series X and s. So we'll
6682120	6683440	wait and see what that looks like.
6687320	6690000	Well, then, um, have actually have you gotten anything though
6690000	6692240	on the the sale that's going on?
6693120	6698760	I have not because I haven't really been buying games because
6698760	6702680	I will and that's not true. I have purchased games, but I
6702680	6706280	don't play them. So no, I didn't pick up anything on the
6706280	6710880	sale. Yeah, I haven't looked to see what they have because yeah,
6710880	6713920	it's more stuff that just probably end up in my back log
6713920	6716880	at some point. So at the finish for Lance three, I haven't even
6716920	6718040	gone through all that. But
6719920	6727400	for anyone on stadia right now, they're doing a sale on pac-man
6727400	6733960	mega tunnel battle, and a few other goodies for it. And then
6733960	6737440	they also have like a bunch of the Assassin's Creed games on
6737440	6740720	sales, city legends hundred days, there's actually a few
6740720	6747840	really good ones on there right now. And a bunch of stuff mark
6747840	6751320	down like the city skylines, stadia edition, just quite a few
6751320	6754360	things that's on sale right now, if you're another stadia player,
6755040	6758560	I'm outriders outriders is one of them on pro right now, that
6758560	6761320	not a lot of the games have a deep discount on epic games
6761320	6763360	right now. The only thing that kind of jumps out at me right
6763360	6766080	now that they have in their top sellers is probably Red Dead
6766080	6769440	Redemption two, which is half off right now. Tiny T's
6769440	6771680	wonderlands like 20% off but like, yeah,
6771720	6774520	yeah, I want to check out tiny Tina's wonderlands. But I'm
6774520	6776640	kind of with you, Loki. I don't want to add to my backlog right
6776640	6779320	now. But you know, I grabbed Borderlands three. I didn't have
6779320	6780960	that yet. So I was like, yoink.
6782760	6784920	That's a great game. It's a little cringe as far as the
6784920	6788640	story dialogue stuff goes, but the game itself is good. Yeah.
6788920	6791640	Did you remember demos actually on stadia right now, including
6791680	6792440	chorus?
6793080	6796640	Did your MSN chat says ttw is so good. Yeah, I want to check it
6796640	6797440	out for sure.
6798800	6803960	Do well, I'm going into my news. I was trying to expand it to
6803960	6805120	give you time to get some water.
6805440	6807080	Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'm back.
6807640	6813280	So for anyone who's playing Kirby 64, the crystal shards
6813280	6816880	through Nintendo Switch Online, there is a game breaking bug.
6817880	6823040	Um, when you are hit by a certain damage sources in the
6823040	6827120	water, you become stunned indefinitely. And the only way
6827120	6831120	to get out of it is to quit the level. And so you can't finish
6831120	6834520	really any of the underwater levels because if you get hit,
6834720	6839840	then you just stay that way. Um, no one remembers this glitch
6839840	6843560	being on the original console. So there has to be some
6843560	6845760	interaction with the original programming and the emulation, I
6845960	6849520	think. So there you go.
6850120	6852680	Boy, I want to apologize to Mike Deft. He's having a rough
6852680	6856400	night. His fave is getting I mean, we just had him murdered
6856400	6859440	during the classic of the week. And then now it's getting shit
6859440	6864560	on. He's it's breaking. He's definitely this is this night
6864560	6865800	for Kirby. I apologize.
6866360	6869600	A giant Kirby though, just destroying everybody though is
6869600	6871040	pretty funny. I'm just gonna say.
6871040	6877920	All right, we will not apologize for the cute imagery of a evil
6877920	6880880	Kirby taking over the world. I mean death by Kirby. What a what
6880880	6881680	a way to go right?
6882280	6883040	Precisely.
6884840	6887720	All right. That's it for rapid fire news.
6887760	6889560	Pie culture kaiju Kirby.
6890400	6892680	Let's travel around the world and check out some release
6892680	6895080	dates. Some things we'll be playing this week that don't
6895080	6897280	have Kirby as a villain. Loki.
6898200	6902640	I mean, anything's possible. I don't know. I don't. I don't
6902640	6905040	keep up with a lot of these games that are coming up and
6905040	6909960	maybe they do. So this week we've got hard space shipbreaker
6909960	6918680	on PC. token Ranboo warriors on Nintendo Switch. Euro kill the
6918680	6923080	culmination game on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and
6923080	6927640	PlayStation five. sniper elite five on PC, PlayStation four,
6927640	6932160	PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. And then we have
6932160	6939640	the legend of Niota boundless trails on Nintendo Switch. And
6939680	6943440	what else that cow the kangaroo on PC, Nintendo Switch,
6943440	6947600	PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
6948120	6954640	My little pony a maritime Bay adventure on PC, Nintendo
6954640	6959000	Switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one. And to go along with
6959000	6964080	Pacman's birthday Pacman museum plus on PC, Nintendo Switch,
6964080	6966840	PlayStation four and Xbox one. That's it.
6968480	6971160	Still a lot of releases. But then I just remembered this
6971160	6974080	weekend is Memorial Day. And that's like the unofficial
6974080	6977520	official kickoff of summer. So I guess this is always a big
6977520	6980480	week for games. And the Yeah, when you kick off for summer,
6980480	6983640	that means you stop releasing video games, because that's
6983640	6986600	typically how that goes. Yeah. Well, you got to get the games
6986600	6989320	out for the kids to pick up for summer break or whatever,
6989320	6992240	although our is the school year getting expanded in a lot of
6992240	6994560	places because of all the shutdowns? I don't know. I
6994560	6997000	don't know. It depends like that. It's different for
6997000	7000120	different districts. My son's off this week. So the other
7000120	7005320	schools have taken upon themselves to add vacation
7005320	7008160	weeks for every month. So some of those are going a little bit
7008160	7008680	longer.
7010080	7012920	All right, let's go to Japan and check out the releases there.
7012920	7016960	It's actually pretty similar to what Loki already stated. So on
7016960	7019640	the Nintendo Switch, we have radiant tale is out in Japan
7019640	7024200	this week. That Yuru kill the culmination games is also out in
7024200	7028120	Japan this week. The Legend of Niota boundless trails also out
7028120	7030840	in Japan this week. I think I heard Loki mentioned all those
7030840	7034920	games here. townsmen a kingdom rebuilt the complete addition.
7034920	7037360	So I think that means DLC included with the base game.
7037760	7040640	That is out from THQ Nordic in Japan this week on the switch
7040680	7044920	and that Pac Man museum plus also gets a Japanese release
7044960	7049080	this week on the PlayStation. Oops, I went to four and I meant
7049080	7053000	to go to five. Sometimes five has some different stuff. PS
7053000	7055880	foreign switch releases Japan are almost always identical with
7055880	7058920	PlayStation five is sometimes has some different ones. That
7058920	7063040	Yuru kill combination games is also on PlayStation five. They
7063040	7066640	also have the persistence enhanced is out in Japan this
7066640	7069920	week. And Oh, interesting. Japan gets their version of five
7069920	7073000	nights at Freddy's security breach this week. It is noted
7073000	7075120	this is an English version of the game. So it hasn't been
7075120	7077960	completely localized, but it is getting officially released in
7077960	7082360	Japan this week. So interesting. All right. And yeah, I agree
7082360	7085160	with she Hulk and chat. Yes, please for Pac Man Museum. I'm
7085160	7088520	looking forward to that as well. Dark Sakura. How about Europe?
7089520	7095840	On the 24th we have eastward for switch. On the 26th we have
7095840	7101040	for PlayStation and Xbox sniper elite five. And also how the
7101040	7105040	house of the dead remake for switch. On the 27th we have cow
7105040	7109600	the kangaroo on the big three, and My Little Pony maritime Bay
7109600	7113440	adventure. And then also just on PlayStation we have mortal
7113440	7115720	shell game of the year steelbook edition.
7115720	7118600	Did you know the limited edition of that house of the
7118600	7123800	dead rerelease is called the limit dead edition. And I find
7123800	7124360	that so funny.
7124360	7125160	I love it.
7126200	7128760	Love to hear that worse the pun the better.
7130480	7135160	We're getting to that age. All right. Let's move on. We have a
7135160	7138640	few more stories for y'all. And then we'll take your calls and
7138960	7141960	comments, emails, all that good stuff. And the listener
7141960	7144360	roundtable. But first, we have a few more stories to get
7144360	7145520	through. And we'll start with Loki.
7146520	7149800	Like it's another week and we get to talk about Activision
7149800	7152800	Blizzard and more trouble at their end. Of course, this time,
7152800	7158200	it's not about you know, all the misogyny and stuff going on. No,
7158200	7166040	we're going back, you know, has several months now back to the
7166040	7170320	land of lawsuits because of gambling and minors. So we're
7170560	7174880	gambling and minors in this course being with loot packs.
7175280	7180160	So the target of this is of course Hearthstone, specifically
7180160	7185120	saying that people pay real world currency to gamble on
7185120	7190280	winning in game items. And they won't provide refunds even when
7190280	7195040	the purchases are completed by a minor. And apparently they argue
7195040	7199520	that children comprise a large segment of their audience. And
7199520	7201920	saying that it's unlawful, deceptive and misleading
7201920	7205600	tactics in Hearthstone. So I think the whole like, you know,
7206080	7209520	enticing people to buy those packs or something like that,
7209520	7214520	that, you know, it's, I don't know, a class action or
7214520	7220200	something worthy. It's a stretch, I think, but like, I
7220200	7223400	get it, you know, that they're saying it because it's targeted
7223400	7227360	towards everybody, but I don't know. Like some other countries,
7227360	7230320	they've been able to kind of get away with, you know, making
7230320	7234440	that lawsuit type of thing happen. But I don't know if they
7234440	7238040	necessarily like, I don't see odds posted on this stuff.
7238200	7240840	No, I don't think they have them. And maybe this is going to
7240840	7245200	pressure them into doing it. But, you know, your kids can't
7245200	7248160	keep buying this stuff if you watch what your kids get.
7249240	7253240	Especially like the screenshot that they show is like a pack
7253240	7259600	that's $125. Like that's a lot of money, like your kids aren't
7259600	7264640	going to necessarily be buying that. Now to bring it back to my
7264640	7269200	kids, like they do get a lot of money and like Roblox sometimes,
7269200	7272240	especially or Roblox or whatever. It's like 100, almost
7272240	7276360	$100 during birthdays or stuff like that Christmas, and they'll
7276360	7279520	blow it like instantly. So it's,
7280520	7283760	yeah, if you see that if you give a child an unlimited
7283760	7287320	balance, they will go through Yeah, yeah, I can see that. But
7287320	7290640	like, you know, I don't know, like they're saying that there
7290640	7294080	is one, one of the people that are part of the lawsuit said
7294080	7298400	this child spent over $300 on the Hearthstone between 2019
7298400	7304120	and 2021. Actually, not that much, honestly, like, like, oh,
7304120	7306240	they were made without his permission using his credit card
7306240	7308400	and debit cards. Yeah. But at the same time, though, that
7308400	7310760	that's your fault for not securing your financial stuff
7310760	7314520	to that. That's the same as like, you know, having kids or
7314520	7317880	teenagers stealing cash out of your purse or something like
7317880	7321280	that. Like it's, if you don't secure your finance, financial
7321280	7325680	stuff, like, yeah, that can happen. But that's not the
7325680	7329840	game's fault. But at the same time, I'm not going to say that
7329840	7334680	like, you know, they aren't trying to tap into that whole
7334760	7339320	gambling FOMO type of mindset when it comes to selling these
7339320	7342920	packs, because they want you to feel like you need to buy them.
7342920	7344640	And so they're going to advertise them like that.
7347600	7351840	All right. Well, there's I saw I even though I think there's
7351840	7354440	kind of a part of me that's like, yeah, get Activision
7354440	7357040	Blizzard, get them, get them, especially Bobby Kotick, get
7357040	7360360	him, like, personally, he should be sued for this just because
7360360	7362720	he's still the CEO of the company. But that's not the
7362720	7365240	realist of the situation. I think in this particular
7365240	7367920	situation, like you've just you've got to put some onus on
7367920	7371000	the parents for how much their kids are spending. You know,
7371200	7377600	when I ran up $100 prodigy bill from using chat rooms, I got I
7377600	7379920	don't want to say beat up because it wasn't that I didn't
7379920	7383640	have that but but but verbally, I got some verbal lashings over
7383640	7387160	the whole thing and grounded fucking grounded like hell and
7387160	7391640	not able to use any of prodigy anymore after that for a little
7391640	7393720	while. So you know, you got it. You got to put some
7393720	7396960	responsibility on, you know, laying down the law when your
7396960	7400840	kids get out of control with that stuff. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah,
7400840	7403760	I'm with Mike Deft. As much as we want to dunk on a BK right
7403760	7408120	now. This ain't it. I and I agree. This ain't it. So. All
7408120	7413160	right. Let's move on. I wonder if this will be it will sit dark
7413160	7413720	Sakura.
7415240	7421120	Well, I think it's, I don't know. So McDonald's is making a
7421120	7424920	video game. I mean, we did have Burger King do it. But this one
7424920	7430680	instead make kids is one more Burger King game so bad, like so
7430680	7431200	bad.
7431360	7432720	Let the story be read, Loki.
7434000	7437360	Anyway, it's sort of an advertisement sort of game.
7437360	7442360	It's called McDonald's crush the rush. And you play as an
7442360	7447400	employee working with drive thru orders. I mean, wasn't
7447400	7451880	there like what an over like a waitress game? I think it sounds
7451880	7453240	like root beer tapper.
7454360	7455880	No, it's, it's
7456200	7459480	a cafe, like Cafe Crush or something like that or like
7459480	7460560	cafe, diner,
7460560	7466120	dash, diner, dash, something ish. I mean, basically, what you
7466160	7469540	have to do is you go to your different stations and you make
7469540	7471840	the different things and you get what you need. It almost looks
7471840	7475720	like a Sims view from up top. But basically, it's just
7475720	7479440	clicking the order of items and get your team to work as
7479440	7481640	efficiently as possible. And they want to make it look like
7481640	7486400	food service is fun and entertaining. But it is
7486400	7490720	repetitive gameplay. The whole thing is just to try to get
7490720	7493500	people to work for McDonald's. And I don't know who would want
7493500	7494000	to do that.
7494360	7499720	I honestly like if I can't imagine somebody plays angles.
7500080	7504940	Yeah, okay. I like that. Well, it seems like wasted. So I mean,
7504940	7508380	I think of America's Army, you know, that was also a recruitment
7508380	7510700	tool for a game and apparently they were actually fun. Yeah,
7510700	7511500	apparently did pretty well.
7511500	7512780	But they're solid games.
7513500	7516340	Fanara wants to point out to Overcooked, which was also on
7516340	7518260	the tip of my tongue. That was it. That's another one of those
7518260	7519780	like team prep games. Yeah, yeah.
7520060	7524740	That's that's a different type of game. Yeah. But yeah, I'm
7524740	7531140	with, we need the king as dead by daylight killer for sure.
7531860	7533300	Well, definitely is scary enough.
7533300	7536700	Oh my god. I mean, McDonald's has all of these great
7536700	7539500	characters that they're not using for games like they, you
7539500	7542720	know, I mean, forget the Burger King. How about the fucking
7542720	7546740	grimace from McDonald's? That would be a scary I mean, that
7546740	7550060	practically is clown in that hippo outfit, but still like the
7550060	7554260	grimace would be a scary fucking dead by daylight killer or the
7554260	7558780	Hamburglar. Or what's what's the other one? Then there's the
7558780	7562660	the their their friend with the pigtails. Yeah, the birdie? I
7562660	7565140	think her name is literally birdie birdie the early bird.
7565180	7565580	Yeah.
7569140	7571500	And then we got it. Then we got to really go back and get the
7571500	7574580	moon. Whatever that was big. Was it Mac?
7574820	7576740	It was Mac. Mac tonight.
7577820	7580900	No, what I want is the Hamburglar to be the killer.
7581060	7584460	And then the fry guys to be like out in the map like with
7584460	7588620	Nemesis and the zombies. Which by the way, I have officially
7588620	7595060	stolen a couple of zombie names from other streamers. So we name
7595060	7595740	our zombies.
7596300	7599700	I would really go for like a dead by daylight game that's
7599700	7604020	just with fast food mascots. Like let's let's do it.
7604300	7607620	The five night Freddy's five nights at Freddy's rumor for DBD
7607620	7611420	will never dies. Now it's been rumored for the last like seven
7611420	7615140	DLC is and they still say oh, it's coming. It's coming. Five
7615140	7616260	nights at Freddy's coming.
7616900	7620820	Keep in mind too is that and they even said so in a very
7620820	7623540	recent interview that when they're working on DLC, they're
7623540	7629740	working on anywhere between like four to 10 extras a year to come
7629740	7634660	out and in in in following years. Like the apparently the
7634660	7638140	Candyman one is still floating around and has a lot of credence
7638140	7638540	with it.
7639980	7644140	Um, listen, boy chat room really loves this McDonald's cross step
7644140	7646980	by daylight, I guess with Burger King thrown in there as well.
7647580	7650740	You know, Chad is really eating this up. So there there's
7653500	7656620	I guess I'll show 100 Matt's comment. The Burger King Kids
7656620	7658620	Club grows up to be a cult like the purge.
7658700	7661740	Oh, now me just added Wendy's to the mix because why not?
7662260	7664860	Oh, you know, Wendy would just dominate. She'd be like the
7664860	7669540	nurse. Difficult to master but once you do, everyone's your
7669540	7670020	bitch.
7670740	7674300	There was a comment I was gonna read up here. Oh, yeah. Oh,
7674300	7677580	teacher teacher on SS Do you get paid a living wage for playing
7677580	7681420	this game? Oh, that was a true that was the truth that was
7681420	7686620	killed by truth. Um, for Nara said, Do they have DLC for this
7686620	7690460	McDonald's game for the McFood game that has the drunk or stone
7690460	7695980	customers and Karen DLC to real to real.
7696580	7699340	That's awesome. That's like her other comment. Wendy's social
7699340	7700620	media manager is a part.
7704060	7707300	I was gonna say this the stone customers, they're at Jack in
7707300	7711100	the Box because number one, everybody in America knows the
7711100	7714660	McFlurry machine. And that's what you want is always broken
7714820	7715980	after a certain hour.
7718140	7719740	But hex session one sauce.
7722620	7727620	But Jack in the Box specifically caters to stoners like they
7727620	7731580	advertised it as what do you think those late night munchy
7731580	7734620	boxes are like legitimately they sell something at Jack in the
7734620	7737420	Box. I know Jack in the Box isn't a nationwide chain. I
7737420	7740740	think they're they're good. I Jack in the Box would have an
7740740	7742300	add on called three day old grease.
7743780	7746860	But but Jack in the Box specifically has like a late
7746860	7751300	night thing that's like a few jalapeno poppers, some popcorn
7751300	7755220	chicken, an egg roll, some curly fries, like it's like a literally
7755220	7758580	a little bit of everything. But it's only available after 11
7758580	7759100	o'clock.
7763300	7764820	And we know exactly why.
7765020	7768900	Do you know you know how we have barbecue and chili? Hmm. Yeah, I
7768900	7773380	think for Wendy's, it would be a chicken nuggets and Frosty's.
7773780	7777380	Yeah, chicken nuggets and Frosty's. All right. Yeah. All
7777380	7781500	right, we got to move on. Let's move on to another story. Loki, I
7781500	7782260	think this is yours.
7783140	7788660	Yeah, so Nintendo is ramping up their fight against cheaters
7788660	7793020	because they have their new eSports game right around the
7793020	7798860	corner with Splatoon three. So they are pants are patenting a
7798860	7804860	new anti cheat program. Okay, apparently they're saying they'd
7804860	7809380	use something called code reuse techniques to auto generate
7809420	7812660	attestation programs to detect whether a game has been
7812660	7817100	modified. I don't know what that means. But they're going to do
7817100	7822060	something to try to stop people from using hacked copies or
7822420	7826060	running fake ones or something like that. And then
7828300	7830980	it sounds like it's not just cheating in games, but trying to
7830980	7833740	get people to stop like launching homebrew and down
7833740	7837180	piracy. Really, it's a pirate, which I understand that, you
7837180	7840740	know, I don't I'm not a fan of pirating current games and so
7840740	7845700	forth. But yeah, and I think they should be getting
7845700	7848980	especially with online games. I don't give a shit if you cheat
7848980	7851660	in a single player game. Like if you're cheating in Super Mario
7851660	7856140	Sunshine, or boy, that's a dated reference. Super Mario Odyssey.
7856180	7858260	Well, hell, you can cheat and sunshine too, because that was
7858260	7862340	in the the recent Mario pack. Mario All Stars they did. But if
7862340	7864500	you cheat in those games, I don't fucking care because it
7864500	7867500	doesn't affect anything else. But if you cheat a Mario Kart
7867540	7871100	online, then I'm mad. So Nintendo should be taking steps
7871100	7872180	to prevent that. Right?
7873300	7878580	Exactly. They should be. But I don't know. I think they're the
7878580	7882140	downside, though, is I mean, the device is made, it's based off
7882140	7885380	of an Android device, and it can run native Android. It's like,
7885980	7888540	it's gonna be hard, or it's gonna be easy for people to
7888540	7891020	circumvent all that stuff. That's how we have all this
7891020	7895060	crazy, you know, emulation stuff. I mean, I don't know,
7895100	7897460	it's gonna be hard for them to do it. But I'm sure they'll
7897460	7903780	try. I don't know. Anything that reduces the number of hackers
7903780	7906340	that they have in like Splatoon stuff, I guess.
7906940	7909500	And I can see why they want to get that going in advance of
7909500	7913740	Splatoon three as well. Yeah, yeah, definitely. So that the
7913740	7917020	chat is still talking about fast food. And now they're talking
7917020	7921340	about I see Taco Bell versus Del Taco. I'm gonna come at you
7921340	7924620	with a real hot take. What is the big fucking deal about
7924620	7925460	Mexican pizza?
7926980	7930300	What is it's fucking delicious. It's like one of the only things
7930300	7933460	there that I like. I don't think it's then again, I mean,
7933460	7935740	honestly, the last time I ate at Taco Bell, it was so disgusting.
7935740	7938020	It's like, just give me Del Taco all the time.
7938060	7941300	They're soft. They're trying. Mexican pizza is a gigantic
7941300	7945820	soggy nacho. That is what it is to me. I don't get it.
7947100	7950100	Mike Defton chat says I asked the same thing and I don't get
7950100	7953180	it. I'm gonna Mike Deft. You live in Mexico. Is that is that
7953180	7956860	a pizza? Is that a pizza? I don't think it is.
7957700	7964700	It's just it's just it's a giant stacked torta, I guess.
7965180	7967380	Let's see other comments in chat. Sia Tabiri says Dolly
7967380	7970980	Parton would like a word with you, Rob. I know. I know. Dolly
7970980	7976060	Parton is my queen. But even even the people you hold in the
7976060	7979420	highest highest regard are not perfect people. And Dolly Parton
7979420	7982740	is allowed to make a mistake whenever she wants. But this is
7982780	7987060	this is her mistake. Um, let's see. Kind Volibian chat says
7987140	7990780	Del Taco gets so much slander for no reason. It is amazing. I
7990820	7995660	have to agree that Del Taco is so much better. It's like it's
7995660	7999300	the only place you can get a taco and fries. It's great.
8000260	8002380	I don't like their fries. Their fries are super dry.
8003380	8006540	I can't eat fries anymore anyway. So it doesn't really
8006540	8011060	matter. But I like the tacos. All right. Mike Deft in chat
8011060	8014780	says an actual Mexican pizza. So for the record, for the record,
8015580	8019260	an actual Mexican pizza from our listener who lives in Mexico is
8019260	8024260	a pizza in all caps with traditional Mexican ingredients
8024300	8028380	like chorizo or pepper. I could see that I could see that.
8028700	8031700	That's actually that sounds good. It's like a chorizo as a
8031740	8034740	topping up. That sounds good. Actually, I would not be able to
8034740	8037780	eat it with all the peppers in it. I Yeah, I know. It's you
8037780	8042900	still to this day. My favorite pizza is California Pizza
8042900	8046060	Kitchen's parent Gorgonzola pizza with plenty of roasted
8046060	8048860	garlic on it. The end. That's the best pizza in the world and
8048860	8050140	no one can convince me otherwise.
8052060	8055220	I never thought of chorizo on pizza. Now I'm like, that sounds
8055220	8058580	fucking good. All right. I mean, the peppers that might be a bit
8058580	8061260	much, but we'll see. We'll see. Maybe a little I can handle I
8061260	8063340	can handle a little bit of pepper. I just don't like a ton
8063340	8065380	of it because it peppers one of those things that's just like it
8065380	8069100	dominates the taste. So let's Yeah, like I love
8069100	8072940	I bet though if you deseeded the peppers and roasted them really
8072940	8076860	well, like almost blackened them. It would take some of the
8076860	8080220	heat out of it. Yeah, I mean, I still wouldn't be able to have
8080220	8082220	it because the enzymes will still be active even if they're
8082220	8086660	roasted. But this the heat is in the seeds for the most part. So
8086660	8089060	you deseed it and roast it really well. You get
8089060	8092380	caramelization on it. And the flavor profile would actually
8092380	8094500	work well with the harder chorizo.
8095100	8097500	We have a really good rex Kim restaurant not far from here.
8097500	8100820	And I don't know how authentic it is. Sorry, Mike deaf. But I
8100820	8103340	love to get they have a fajita salad as like my favorite thing
8103340	8106220	on the menu for this current like diet I'm doing. And they
8106220	8108580	put peppers in it. But it's like you said, they blackened them a
8108580	8111460	little bit. So it doesn't like overpower everything else is I
8111460	8113860	love the fajita salad there. It's so good. It's like the
8113860	8117860	perfect lunch for me. Anyway, yeah. St 100 Matt says OLR foodie
8117860	8120460	episode is happening now. Oops, oops. Yeah, well, we've put that
8120460	8123980	off way too long. But that is 100% my fault. So we'll get that
8123980	8127740	scheduled very soon. Mike deaf says if it's run by Mexicans,
8127740	8133180	then I trust it. I believe so. I've never asked but I believe
8133180	8139340	so. So it we we don't usually have a problem finding decent
8139340	8143460	Mexican food in California. Yeah, yeah, it's it's not hard
8143460	8146340	to find but it ain't a Taco Bell. All right.
8146940	8154980	I mean, we we I have everything from super taco to taqueria
8154980	8160540	Vallarta to what's my other taco place? There's the truck that
8160540	8166020	comes to work sometimes. And nothing is as as good as a good
8166020	8168420	taco truck. And then like one of my favorite burger places was
8168420	8172540	actually a chain started by a Mexican family called Tommy's.
8173140	8176100	Oh, yeah. That's the place with the chili on the burgers. Yeah,
8176100	8179220	you you made us detour to a Tommy's. It wasn't that far of a
8179220	8181460	detour. But you were like, we got to get Tommy's way home.
8181500	8186820	Yeah. Yeah. All right. We have one more story for you before we
8186820	8189780	get to the listener roundtable. And that is to talk about what I
8189780	8193540	think is a very interesting turn of fate. And, you know, there's
8193540	8198220	been a lot of talk about Warner Brothers latest Smash esque sort
8198220	8201700	of game called multi versus. In fact, I think people are
8201700	8205380	streaming that on Twitch and stuff right now. I have a sneeze
8205380	8209180	coming on. Thank God I hit the mute button in time. Sorry,
8209180	8214260	guys. Um, so multi versus is like a smash s kind of game
8214260	8217260	that's an alpha right now. Well, apparently the game is good
8217260	8220380	enough or the right agreements have been signed where multi
8220380	8226340	versus is going to be at Evo championship series for 2022. In
8226340	8231420	fact, it's taking smashes spot. Now, you might remember Nintendo
8231420	8235780	pulled smash from Evo. So it's kind of their own fucking fault.
8235980	8239820	So it is very interesting that, okay, well, we're gonna replace
8239820	8244580	smash with a smash esque or a smash inspired, we'll say, type
8244580	8249540	of game instead. So that's very interesting. So yeah, Nintendo
8249540	8252820	had pulled out of Evo. But we just we still don't know why
8252820	8255380	Nintendo pulled out. But then we had the panda global
8255380	8257940	partnership. So maybe it was something like that. But now
8257940	8262860	Evo has multi versus so made this, you know, could Nintendo
8262860	8267540	have shot themselves in the foot by letting this get picked up
8267540	8271140	by Evo. And now the fans are going to focus on it. People are
8271140	8274620	going to practice with this game. You know, I it's it's kind
8274620	8277820	of giving this game a leg up by its ability to be included in
8277820	8281260	Evo. So it'll be interesting to see. Quest Buster says an open
8281260	8285300	beta is slated for multi versus in July. And I've seen a few
8285300	8287420	streams that looks like the devs have a lot of fun with the
8287420	8292060	characters. So Mike Deaf says panda global is partnering with
8292060	8296660	Nintendo and Sony running Evo. So you know, so yeah, it's true
8296660	8303940	Sony Sony bought Evo too. So anyway, let's go to the listener
8303940	8307780	roundtable. Every week we invite your feedback here on the show
8307820	8311340	over at twitch.tv slash vog network. We also take your
8311340	8315740	emails participate at orange lounge radio.com. Dark soccer
8315740	8318300	stepped away for a moment we'll, we'll ask her when she
8318300	8322700	gets back we have any emails I don't think there were. We also
8322700	8325900	invite your calls if you want to join our discord server over at
8325900	8329540	vog network.com slash discord. We chat throughout the week
8329540	8332220	about stuff or if you want to you can join the green room,
8332780	8334620	which is one of our chat channels and we'll take some
8334620	8338340	calls here live on air. If you don't want to do any of that,
8338740	8345100	we'll always be happy to take a chat questions over in our chat
8345100	8348180	room over twitch.tv slash vog network where they're still
8348180	8350540	talking about multiverses, which is fine because we were just
8350540	8354860	talking about that. While we wait to see if any questions
8354860	8358060	well, let me get some comments here. Tiger class as I think
8358060	8361700	it's good that multiverses will be at Evo. It gives the game of
8361700	8364420	ton of exposure and might have more people wanting to play it.
8364740	8367500	And kind of Vullaby says I've already seen a number of pro
8367500	8371220	smash players trying multiverses and it seems popular with them.
8371460	8374100	I guess time will tell if it's just another fad or not though
8374100	8377860	kind of like Nick all stars brawl. It's true. That one was
8377860	8380980	supposed to be a big one and the shade is real came in when it
8380980	8383860	has all the voice actors in this one. So that's cool. Yeah, it's
8383860	8386980	true. It does. Dark soccer. Do we? I don't think we have
8386980	8389060	anything in the mailbag. But let me check just to be sure. Oh,
8389060	8392040	no, we do not. Alright, so participate at orange
8392040	8396540	launchradio.com. Oh, so I always say when when you don't email us
8396540	8399020	and give us something to talk about, then it's an excuse for
8399020	8402100	dark soccer and I to talk about drag race. Now for the most part
8402100	8404580	in the last year, I haven't bothered to watch drag race
8404580	8406540	because there's just there's too many of them now there's there's
8406540	8410700	the international one. There's the but they just give me a
8410700	8414380	couple of seasons. They just started the all winners one. So
8414380	8418100	all stars all winners started on Friday. And all I'm gonna say
8418100	8420660	I'm not going to spoil because the Paramount thing is weird
8420660	8422940	because now that it's on streaming people watch at
8422940	8427660	different times. All I'm gonna say is this is the shakeup the
8427660	8432900	format has needed for a long, long time. And I'll say I don't
8432900	8436460	think it's a spoiler for me to say the show is now edited to be
8436460	8441580	99% positive. All the judges critiques positive, all of the
8441580	8444140	edits that the players got during snatch game and during
8444140	8447500	the first challenge, positive, everything was positive. And the
8447500	8450660	show is not hurting because of it. Like it's actually probably
8450660	8454100	the strongest season they've had in a long time. So it was just
8454100	8456820	it's amazing. And all I said that snatch game, you know,
8456820	8458900	again, I don't know if that's just because of editing where
8458900	8461420	they chose to show the positive but I really think like the
8461420	8466660	talent that was in that snatch game like jinx monsoon. That's
8466660	8469500	the tweet. That's like there there there will never be
8469500	8471860	another better there will never be a better game player than
8471860	8472260	jinx months.
8472260	8477420	I love I loved meeting her. She she's just so funny in person.
8477500	8483820	You you have to see the snatch game she does. So can I can I
8483900	8485260	can I tell you who she does?
8485740	8486380	Who does she do?
8486460	8488820	So the twist is that they have to do
8488860	8491540	because before she did little Edie before right did she does
8491540	8494860	somebody different they have to do two characters this time. So
8494860	8498420	they actually do two different snatch games. The first game she
8498420	8502420	does Natasha Lyonne from my Russian doll the redhead right
8502460	8506940	who isn't but I'm here. Oh my god she had the voice because
8506940	8509780	you because you know Natasha Lyonne has a very distinctive
8509780	8513580	raspy voice probably from all the smoking. She had the voice
8513740	8521220	down. The second celebrity she does Judy Garland. It Jamie it
8521220	8526740	was mind blowingly good. Like you laugh until you cry. It was
8526740	8530380	so good. It was so good. You have to watch it like I'll loan
8530380	8534260	you my because I mean, when when what's your name did a Liza
8534260	8539420	Minnelli. That was dead on and I can see jinx pulling off a
8539420	8542220	perfect Judy Garland. I would love to see the two of them
8542220	8547500	together. Yeah. So but but jinx has a really good talent for
8547500	8549980	voices because her little Edie was pretty dead on to
8551020	8555020	Raja does a celebrity. I have to tell you who Raja does one of
8555020	8557180	them at least. Sorry. Sorry, Loki.
8557220	8558180	Just tell me both.
8559460	8563420	Diana Vreeland is one of the ones that she Raja does. And
8563420	8565620	that's that's like the the person that was over Vogue
8565620	8568300	magazine like in the 70s and 80s. So that was that was fine.
8568300	8573660	That was funny. But she does Madam. The puppet from wailing
8573660	8581820	flowers and Madam. It is Jamie. It's, it's so good. It's so
8581820	8582340	good.
8583700	8586260	The winners on the season or is it just a handful of all
8586260	8586900	winners?
8587100	8595060	It's um, it's Raja, jinx, Shea couleé, Monet exchange, not
8595060	8602540	Bianca, Trinity, the tuck, the Vivian from the UK. Did I say
8602540	8603380	jinx already?
8603860	8604420	Yeah.
8605980	8609020	Oh, Jada, Essence Hall, and Evie Oddly.
8610140	8611020	I love Evie.
8611420	8615540	So it's a really good cast. So even though Yeah,
8615580	8616620	he's also a sweetheart.
8616660	8619180	There's a lot of people that are like, Where's Bianca? Where's
8619180	8623500	Trixie? Where's Alaska? I think these are a lot of girls that
8623500	8626340	like are absolutely like not to say the others aren't worth
8626340	8628780	revisiting. But there are a lot of them are booked and blessed.
8628780	8630980	And I'm sure these winners could be booked and blessed too. But to
8630980	8633940	be on TV again and go through all this is really, really great
8633940	8636260	for them. And it's just Yeah, and I'm sure they're saving some
8636260	8638900	for a potential second season down the line. So
8639380	8644860	I will. I will also tell you that I'm perfectly happy for
8644860	8647460	Tracy to not be on there if I can keep watching her use Easy
8647460	8651980	Bake Ovens. Anyway, I had Dan watching that he was laughing.
8652380	8656060	Jamie, it was a it was a Waylon Flowers and Madam reference.
8656060	8659300	Like only like only people over 40 are gonna understand why
8659300	8662300	that's so fucking funny. But that was the stuff that was on
8662300	8662940	late at night.
8663620	8669140	I will. I will have to go YouTube-ify it.
8669540	8671740	Or just ask me nicely for my Paramount Plus.
8671740	8674380	We actually have Paramount Plus now so Dan can watch Star Trek.
8674380	8675540	Well, then get on it.
8676740	8679860	Eventually, eventually. All right. I got I got shit to do.
8679860	8682500	Like I still have to finish doing the cat video again. I
8682500	8683900	need to send me more pictures of cheddar.
8684740	8689100	Oh, yeah, I need to send you cheddar cat pics for for a
8689100	8691900	redone intro video here for when we're live on Sunday nights.
8691900	8695700	Absolutely. So I'd love to have a new one for our 20th. Because
8695700	8697420	I don't know what else we're gonna have for our 20th.
8699260	8701180	Maybe that should be the foodie episode.
8701580	8704540	Um, I think we should definitely get that done before the 20th.
8704700	8707220	Yeah. So I'll have to check with everyone's availability, though,
8707220	8708820	because I know you're going on a big trip, Jamie, you're not
8708820	8711500	gonna be here next week. So I'm gonna be here next week. It's the
8711500	8717700	week after. Um, I am flying to Illinois on June 2. And I'm
8717700	8722740	returning on the fifth. I'm helping my friend move her cats.
8723100	8727700	You are who has been who you have seen in in my streams, and
8727700	8730740	she's coming here as well. Amethyst Rose, which Oh, yeah, I
8730740	8733460	know the name. Yeah, yeah. My, my friend who also lives around
8733460	8737180	the corner for me. Um, basically, the cats can't go in
8737180	8742580	the car because of, you know, nervous reasons. So we in Delta,
8742580	8745820	which we're taking, we're doing first class, which I've never
8745860	8751580	done first class before. So come on celebrity. Well, I'm doing
8751620	8755740	the the comfort economy on the way back, at least it's the, you
8755740	8760780	know, the comfort seats. But, but because, you know, we got
8760780	8763260	to check the luggage because the cats are going to be a carry on
8763260	8767980	each. And I'm going to be probably really drunk by the
8767980	8768620	time we land.
8770420	8774020	Just saying, what part of Illinois, not Chicago, I guess,
8774060	8778620	just the rest of four hours from Chicago. Okay, without doxing a
8778620	8782420	fellow. Sure, sure. I understand. Yeah. So so but I'm, I
8782420	8788260	would like to go into Chicago, but we're flying into St. Louis.
8788340	8791740	And I said, Okay, you know, it's gonna happen. I double check to
8791740	8794420	make sure I could. We're going to the Waffle House.
8796620	8801020	I checked. I don't miss I did. I already checked. Okay, I was
8801020	8804060	gonna say Missy OLR St. Louis base. So I'd Yeah, cool.
8804460	8808220	I said we are going to the damn Waffle House. You're gonna have
8808220	8811820	the grits and you're gonna like it. No, I'm kidding. I don't if
8811820	8815820	she doesn't like it. She doesn't like it. But um, I like I think
8815820	8818580	I have like three bags of grits that I promised one to my
8818580	8822300	co worker and I might just pick up some more on the way back.
8822300	8825420	Like if I get there early enough, I might stop into a
8825420	8827180	Waffle House. See if the managers there because you can
8827180	8831580	buy grits over the counter 99 cents a bag. Awesome. And at
8831580	8834900	last, I freaking love Waffle House grits now. Now some folks
8834900	8837740	in chat are like, Hey, Jamie's gonna be near me. I want to go
8837740	8840300	drive. Well, I'm gonna be near you briefly because we still
8840300	8844500	have to get those cats. Yeah. To my friend's place. Yeah. All
8844500	8846660	right. Well, that'll be a fun trip. That's that'll be cool.
8846700	8849700	I it's a place I've never been before a couple places I've
8849700	8852700	never been before. I'd love to do a long drive across the
8852700	8858700	country. At some point, but you know, time money. Her her
8858700	8862660	husband, I think is doing the the drive with all the the
8862660	8866820	moving stuff. And we're doing even know either that or they're
8866820	8869620	having movers do it and he's flying on his own to get start
8869620	8872140	getting stuff set up and then we're flying together on it.
8873220	8876460	Yeah. All right. Let me go to Loki and see if there's any
8876460	8879660	last minute stories for tonight to get into because mostly I
8879660	8882180	don't see I didn't see any questions from chat. If I missed
8882180	8885020	it, please ask it again. But most most of chat is just
8885340	8888220	adding to what dark soccer is talking about with her story
8888220	8888500	there.
8889580	8893700	Sadly, there's not really anything last minute. Fair
8893700	8897260	enough. I imagine next week's gonna be a bit of a slow week
8897260	8899740	with it being Memorial Day weekends, a little bit of a long
8899740	8902180	weekend, or maybe that affects the week after I don't know.
8902500	8907380	Oh, all right. Well, then I guess that is going to do it for
8907380	8910060	another episode of orange launch radio. Hey, thank you as always
8910060	8912660	for listening to our show. Whether you were downloading

8920820	8923100	to about the show help us spread the word because we are the show
8923100	8926020	where every gamer has a voice. But we need more voices here. We

8928900	8931780	want to get us a gift, tell a friend about the show. That
8931780	8935260	would be a perfect gift for us. Get us some more follows on
8935260	8938940	twitch over twitch.tv slash vog network. Really appreciate all
8938940	8943420	of that. So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or
8943460	8947300	wherever it is you found this Spotify. What else is out there?
8947300	8949600	I don't even know anywhere wherever whatever you used to
8949600	8953020	find this a going off a long way. So yeah, Mike Deaf says
8953020	8955820	Summer Games Fest is close. So it's the calm before the storm,
8955820	8960620	I guess. Yep. And since there's no E3 this year, those type of
8960620	8962780	summer announcements are just going to be sprinkled throughout
8962780	8964860	the next three months because you'll notice Sony has not
8964860	8968300	staked a claim. And I think they're waiting. I don't think
8968300	8970300	we're going to see Sony in June. I think we're going to see them
8970300	8973460	closer to end of July, August, because they don't have nothing
8973460	8975700	else is forcing them to go earlier. So they're on their own
8975700	8980420	timetable. So be very interesting. So all right. Um,
8980700	8984580	and dark to see you. Yes, I did see what you were working on. But
8984580	8989620	I'll wait and talk about that during the 20th. So let's see.
8990260	8993420	That's it that I can think of. So this is the part where we go
8993420	8996100	around and get everybody's final thoughts. I will start with dark
8996100	8999300	Sakura because I know she's going to do a post stream for
8999300	9001300	y'all. Dark Sakura, your final thought.
9002060	9004940	Um, I need blood points. I gotta feed a legion.
9006260	9011080	All right, good luck with the some growing a teenagers quote
9011080	9014520	finger. Good luck teenagers. Sorry, stabbing and killing in
9014520	9018420	dead by daylight. All right. Exactly. Later taters. Have a
9018420	9021860	good one. Loki will go to you in your final thought for
9021860	9022300	tonight.
9023140	9026260	I just saw that power wash simulator added more levels. So
9026340	9027940	I need to check that out again.
9029820	9032120	My final thought is I was just saying to a friend the other
9032120	9035220	day, I want to play a game like Diablo again, but I don't really
9035220	9037780	want to play Diablo. My friend was like, Oh, Diablo immortals
9037780	9038900	coming out. And I was like,
9040020	9040940	is there anything else?
9042260	9046140	Anything else? I mean, I haven't found engines. Oh, yeah, now
9046140	9048300	they're now you're talking maybe I'll pick up Minecraft
9048300	9050660	Dungeons again. That was kind of fun when I played it. So that'll
9050660	9055660	be fun. So. All right. Wow, as Joe and Matt says, I'm sadly
9055660	9058160	gonna miss the 20th anniversary episode going to a friend's
9058160	9060580	wedding that night a damn Sunday wedding. Well, I mean, it's a
9060580	9062940	good excuse. But you know, it's really funny. Bobby Blackwell is
9062940	9066380	missing our 20th anniversary as well. So you know, I guess if you
9066380	9070220	can be here, it's gonna be a small party. It'll be it'll be a
9070260	9074100	pandemic party. Right? In all seriousness, thank you any week
9074100	9076520	that you're here. We appreciate you. Have a wonderful week,
9076520	9078580	everybody. We'll see you in seven days to do it again. Have
9078580	9079660	a good night. Bye.
