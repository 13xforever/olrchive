00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
I usually avoid the big headline in these opening reads, but sometimes it is THE issue and I want to say it out loud as well. Please help support those in need by whatever means you're able. Tonight we're covering a bundle supporting a memorial fund for Uvalde victims. Many can give blood, plasma, etc. and plenty of other media outlets have their suggestions available as well.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
It's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to provide further information on this and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:59.000 --> 01:17.000
Welcome to episode 916 of our show for tonight, May the 29th of 2022. It's Memorial Day weekend. It's a long weekend. But we're still here. I'm here. Rob Roberts and I am joined by as always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hi, DarkSakura. How are you?

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm tired. Yeah, I moved a shelf and probably shouldn't have.

01:24.000 --> 01:44.000
Uh, yeah, that that happened to me a couple weeks ago, because an electrician came by because you know, we're in a new house, and something was going on with one of the circuits. And he was like, I can't move that. So I had to move this big old shelving. It's it's the one that you you brought over the shelving thing. It's big, but I had to move it by myself. So the guy could move back there.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
It's not that heavy.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
It's heavy enough for one person. So I still hurt my back.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Ryan and I moved it out. So.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
That's two people. I had one person.

01:55.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah, but I also have moved one of those around by myself. A bigger one. And okay.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Let's say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Hello.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Hi, Loki. How are you doing?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm doing good.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
Good. What is this game behind you tonight? This? I've never seen this.

02:18.000 --> 02:30.000
I was searching for another long play video to play and I saw that they had one for Little Britain. I didn't realize there was a Little Britain game. But now there is and you can experience it.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Wow.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Me neither. There.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
I'm assuming it was one of those shovelware titles on the Wii.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
PlayStation two. It was way before the Wii.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
All right.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
And apparently it was trying to Yeah, I remember actually when this came out.

02:46.000 --> 02:54.000
I was watching Little Britain. Oh, yeah, I remember the show is the fact they made a game marketing all kinds of stuff on in the UK. Wow.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
All right. And here I thought the British invasion on consoles was done with Spice World on the PlayStation one.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
But this is Spice World is I unironically a good game. This Oh, come on. There's also Wallace and Gromit.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
Oh, yeah, I guess that's true. No, I'm sure there's plenty of others. I'm just and there was the Monty Python's complete waste of time. Oh, sure. Sure.

03:16.000 --> 03:24.000
All right. There's there's there's some other stuff. I guess we got to get there's also supposed to be a Doctor Who game on the nest that never made out a prototype.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
Really? I didn't know that. That's cool. Yeah, I went looking for the ROM dump up at last night, but I haven't had any luck.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
Well, there's some fun ROM dumps that came out this week, but we'll get to that later in the show.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
For now, we're going to start off tonight's show. A bit of difficult news because it ties into things that are going on in the real world.

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
Obviously, all of the news that came out of Texas with the school shooting is is horrific and horrible.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
And I could probably spend a whole three hours. I'm going off on that. I'm not going to though.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
There's a bundle that's coming out to try to help folks to try to do something to raise money.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
If I remember right, it's a charity for the school that was impacted and trying to get some of the folks there.

04:07.000 --> 04:15.000
Some some mental health treatment and maybe pay for some things that might be a little harder to come by otherwise.

04:15.000 --> 04:27.000
So it's an itch.io bundle and it's for the it's called the bundle for Valde and it's got a variety of NES ROM games in it.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
But I think we all know why the reason why I'm bringing it up on this show. Loki, is there anything you would care to say about this bundle?

04:34.000 --> 04:45.000
Yes. So this bundle was one that Nate Peters, who also does NES dev stuff, he has a game doodle world.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Chocolates should be coming out on the switch here pretty soon.

04:48.000 --> 05:03.000
So he put it together where it's a bunch of just basically trying to get any itch.io creators to come together to put together a bundle of games for the of all the the Rob School Memorial Fund.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
So it's got my game Pixel Hoops number two in there. There's lots of other NES games in there as well.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
So if you're a fan of the NES, there's tons and tons of homebrew games.

05:14.000 --> 05:24.000
So we have like Doodle World, Shira and the 40 Thieves, Nix the Paradox Relic, Turtle Paint, which is kind of fun as a little Mario Paint game.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
Lots and lots of NES games in there. So there's actually a total of like 34 items in there.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
I think most of these are games. There's also I think some other like asset packs and stuff in there.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Not your, you know, 1000 game bundles that you had for like, you know, some of the other things.

05:39.000 --> 05:48.000
But it's still it's nice. It's 10 bucks or, you know, anything else you want to donate to that and then you get everything.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
So the price of my game, you get my game and lots of other games are probably better than mine.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
Yeah, I mean, there you go. I'm not saying yes to that. But yes to the the quote unquote deal. It shouldn't be about the deal, but I get it.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
The deal is what gets people's attention for the worthy cause.

06:04.000 --> 06:15.000
And like you said, for the cost of your game, you can now pick up a lot of NES games and a lot of similar type of games of creators that went in there and made their own NES titles.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
And as pointed out by you and other folks in chat, some other collections like asset titles, some tabletop RPGs and so forth.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
And again, for an important cause that sucks that we have to have this cause, but we do people are trying to help.

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
So this is this is good. And I know I know you were trying to get in a previous charity bundle and you were kind of wondering, like, how do I get in on one of these bundles?

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
But here you go. You got it on one. So yep. So I went through that process. It's pretty easy.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
Awesome. Well, congratulations on that. And how long does that bundle run for?

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
It's running for the week, so it's going to be ending in about six days. So I think the end of this week.

06:52.000 --> 07:06.000
Nice. Going to our chat room because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG network twitch.tv slash VOG network VOG network and you can find us there.

07:06.000 --> 07:15.000
We have our live chat room who makes comments such as Bobby Black Wolf, ironically says just picked it up for $25. Excellent. Excellent. I haven't picked it up yet, but I will.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.000
I want to help you all reach your goal, which I'm sure you'll have no problem reaching as word about this gets out. So that's that's awesome.

07:22.000 --> 07:30.000
And dark Titsiya saying I heard Loki was trying to get his game in there. Yeah, well, if you follow Loki on Twitter, you sometimes get some insight.

07:31.000 --> 07:41.000
Definitely signal boosted that one on Twitter and just picked it up myself. Awesome. And I hope us mentioning it on the show brings a little more awareness and maybe a few more people will pick it up. That would be awesome.

07:41.000 --> 07:55.000
Hopefully. Yeah. Before we get into our headline tonight, dark Sakura, I know you'd been texting me the other day about another charity effort going on that you wanted to bring attention to and I figured now as good of a time as any.

07:55.000 --> 08:09.000
I mean, it's going to be over at 10 o'clock today, but there's fundraisers actually ongoing for one of people in our general Dead by Daylight and other streaming games community on Twitch.

08:09.000 --> 08:37.000
I'm a pansexual pirate has a heart condition and isn't in the best shape. So, money is being raised for medical treatment and or post costs that might come about really really just fun personal around and I hate that, that they're going through this, but I have a link for those in chat to a

08:37.000 --> 08:51.000
post that shows where donations and contacts can be made if you go on Twitter, it's TTV pan PIR number eight.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
And you can get more information there.

08:53.000 --> 09:04.000
So yeah, even maybe after tonight, I'm sure there'll still be a way to contribute to that. For those that don't hear this until Monday or Tuesday so if you're feeling so generous and can help somebody out.

09:04.000 --> 09:20.000
I know dark soccer the, you have increased your participation in the Twitch community 10 fold over the past year, year and a half, you know, with your own, you know channel and streaming and so forth and just again I know I've joked about this on a private previous

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
I can't go into a dead by daylight streamers channel and not run into you.

09:25.000 --> 09:43.000
But I specifically lately you can't go into Nick's channel. Yeah, but it's just because you and I just both like I you consider Nick a friend I consider Nick a friend like we've met him we've hung out with the same people exactly so it's like one of those like you know, yeah, of course we're gonna run into each other there so but that's not the only one.

09:43.000 --> 10:00.000
But my point is is just you know to kind of show in a lighthearted way that like you know you do and you do become friends with the streamers you do make room in your heart for them you do you know start to get to know them very well and so when somebody's going through something very difficult.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah, you want to do whatever you can to help so I get it.

10:04.000 --> 10:33.000
Mike Defton chat says that's me and Pokemon streams and yeah it might be it might be related to a specific game it also might not be it might be just you know a particular personality that you enjoy or what have you so yeah it's it's very interesting how Twitch has really impacted gaming culture, specifically since the pandemic started really I mean I know Twitch was already pretty big before then but I really think the pandemic just

10:33.000 --> 10:42.000
accelerated it even more if you know what I mean and really like that was just even more so the way we saw people many times. So, yeah.

10:42.000 --> 10:56.000
All right, let's move on to our kickoff topic headline for tonight which has to do with a pretty big significant move in the industry for a triple A studio so this isn't the first time this has happened.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
It's the first time it's happened at triple A studio, Loki you want to get into what happened this week.

11:01.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah, so basically, it's the least evil thing they could do so. Phil Spencer said that Microsoft will recognize the Raven software union. Once the deal, the acquisition deal of Activision closes.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
So they're going to actually recognize them basically say hey listen once we acquire them.

11:25.000 --> 11:41.000
We're not, I don't know like Activision actively trying to stop the union exactly that's well, and it's important to say Monday was the day that Raven voted for the union to have right so that's you know that's the first bit of it is that I, I don't have the vote

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
in front of me it was something like 26 to three or something like that I may have gotten that wrong sorry I just don't have the numbers in front of me.

11:47.000 --> 11:54.000
But it was it was pretty overwhelming you had a few people that voted no but the vast majority voted yes.

11:54.000 --> 12:08.000
Even in light of Activision's attempt to kind of union bust in their own way I think I think they kind of had to scale it back once the general public has been paying attention to everything that they do.

12:08.000 --> 12:18.000
But there's definitely documented emails and efforts and things that happened right around the time, you know, they were first in the news for for all the reasons.

12:18.000 --> 12:29.000
You know, we've been talking about them lately to with some open union busting and you know hiring people that work there that that have been known for working with union busting organizations.

12:29.000 --> 12:47.000
Those efforts failed with Raven having unionized this week. And so I think it's a little bit significant for Phil Spencer Microsoft to come in and say, you know, even though Activision was is was engaging in the process of union busting Raven or Microsoft will acknowledge Ravens union.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Yeah, because they certainly won't be the last.

12:50.000 --> 13:01.000
Right, and they basically he will Phil Spencer basically said that Linda Norman and I have been spending a lot of time educating myself on unions we absolutely support employees right to organize and form unions.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
Once the deal closes we'd absolutely support employees organization in the place.

13:06.000 --> 13:13.000
We think it's a right of employees and something that can be a part of the relationship between a company and people who work at the company.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
So, doesn't sound like they're gonna stand their way.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Hopefully their actions. Follow that right.

13:20.000 --> 13:36.000
It's interesting to to hear Phil Spencer say he has to educate himself on unions that kind of makes you stop and realize, oh, because Microsoft isn't and, and you know all these other studio how many studios did Microsoft swoop up in the last 10 years.

13:36.000 --> 13:53.000
Double digits at least they haven't had to deal with this before so I would gather, Phil Spencer probably doesn't just have to educate himself on this for Ravens purposes, but probably for where other studios are going to go in the coming years, I think it's

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
going to be a wave that moves quicker rather than, you know, slowly. We'll see.

14:00.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah, but it also probably shows how much misinformation is spread around in the corporate world about unions anyway.

14:07.000 --> 14:22.000
Oh well we know that there's many companies that will watch have you watch videos that is basically anti union stuff because Kotaku or one of their sister sites had that target training video from the early 90s because they actually the irony was that used

14:22.000 --> 14:39.000
union actors, and they had a whole story about it and and that. So, yeah, but there's like there's a target video that went through that and you can watch it if you want to see for yourself like what the propaganda is Walmart absolutely has something similar

14:40.000 --> 15:06.000
and so on and so on. You definitely also point out that this is not something unique to just the gaming industry. Starbucks, we've heard a lot of buzz about that lately. Granted, this is a video game podcast so we don't talk about those usually, but it's where you see a lot of industries headed right now not just the gaming industry, but I think we all know why the gaming industry needs it.

15:06.000 --> 15:29.000
Right. Yeah, because what the conditions aren't great. Also, there was a comment from Reggie Fils-Aime, who was interviewed by believe the Washington Post basically saying, you know, he made a comment about I don't even know how it came up, but you know, I've worked in industries that have had high levels of unionization.

15:29.000 --> 15:50.000
This is not a bad or good thing. It is a situation as leader, as an executive that you need to manage to just like any other challenge or issue or opportunity you face. So, I mean, I don't know. Cool. He thinks that yeah, I'm not really like at a game company right now. So it's like,

15:51.000 --> 16:19.840
yeah, Reggie isn't at a game company anymore. So it doesn't really, it sounds harsh. It doesn't really matter what he thinks. However, I still think he holds a lot of influence in this industry. I think he knows it too. So, you know, as he's going on this book tour, I think I think people listen to what he has to say just from his insight, having been at Nintendo and of course, Nintendo has been in the spotlight recently as well. They have we've heard a lot of, especially when it comes to the

16:19.840 --> 16:49.820
contractors. We've had a lot of talk about that. So, you know, they they've been in the spotlight as well. I do find that interesting that Reggie does have that perspective. And we have to remember he wasn't always at Nintendo. He came from I know he had been at Panda Express for a while vh one wasn't it or something like that. So certainly in the the vh one television industry, you had all sorts of unions, right? You you deal with Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild, the all of it, dealing with that.

16:49.840 --> 17:15.480
So yeah, he probably did have that experience. So Dr. See, it says I think Little Caesars as well. And I, I don't know the man's entire resume, but I do know Nintendo was the first gaming company he was at, as far as I remember. So yeah, that's just interesting. So we'll see. Do you think Do you think more companies are set to unionize in the near future? Do you think we're gonna have another AAA studio by the end of the year? We'll say?

17:16.480 --> 17:17.200
Probably.

17:17.200 --> 17:46.200
Yeah, I think so. I think what we're hearing from Phil Spencer, I think we'll probably mobilize another Microsoft Studio. And I think I think Activision Blizzard, I think Activision Blizzard itself will end up here in a matter of time. So we'll see. All right. Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks in a segment we call how is your gaming week? So dark Sakura, we'll start with you. How is your gaming week?

17:47.200 --> 18:16.200
I've played some Dead by Daylight. I played Terran, Terranigma. I've played some of that word game that I play to it's just been kind of, especially after having the big pinball thing, I've just sort of been like, I kind of don't feel like playing anything. So just my usual, then, of course, I had my COVID booster, my second one on Tuesday. And I've been really freakin tired. So it's sort of like, do I really want to go?

18:17.200 --> 18:29.200
Do I want to deal with all of this? No. But I played a little bit here and there. Although I did have to have to cancel my stream on on Thursday for just being way too pooped.

18:29.200 --> 18:34.200
But yeah, the booster will knock you out sometimes just dependent. It was depends on the person.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.200
I was surprised that Saturday I still felt like crap. But yeah, better now.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.200
Yeah. All right. Well, we'll go over to Loki. How was your gaming week?

18:42.200 --> 18:53.200
It's just Minecraft. It's just getting ready for things to come. I guess, you know, starting another S&P pretty soon. So just getting all prepared for that.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.200
I saw you put out another video, though. Plug, plug.

18:56.200 --> 19:02.200
Put out another video. Yeah. Yeah. So like still trying to get it down to weekly stuff. I need to.

19:02.200 --> 19:12.200
I have more of my hardcore series. I got a film and then I've got to put out a tutorial for a copper farm that I put together.

19:12.200 --> 19:18.200
So because I've been promising to do that and been putting it off. So I need to do that as well.

19:19.200 --> 19:30.200
So Leo, I'm very busy. I also need to finish the hardcore series, hopefully around the time because the new update for Minecraft, the one 18 updates on the seventh. So it's right around.

19:30.200 --> 19:34.200
And what are they what are they adding in that for those of us not as in the loop?

19:34.200 --> 19:54.200
So it's called the wild update. It's basically they've got a couple new biomes in there. So the big one is, of course, the deep dark in the ancient cities are in there and they have a new kind of it's not really a boss monster, but it's like a pretty tough monster to go up against, which is the warden.

19:54.200 --> 20:07.200
And so they have that. They're also adding mangrove swamps. So they're kind of redoing the swamps a little bit to make them more interesting because swamps are really terrible before. And frogs, frogs are in there now. So that's kind of cool.

20:07.200 --> 20:13.200
They poop out lights because that's what frogs do. They make lights with their butt.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.200
According, I learned something today.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.200
All right. World to live in.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.200
What a world.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.200
My gaming week.

20:24.200 --> 20:32.200
I have been a little busy I hosted another show last night was really good so can't can't complain about spending the hours on that.

20:32.200 --> 20:48.200
But it's a very typical Rob gaming week played some Final Fantasy 14, of course, doing then doing the new raid with that there's a 24 man raid that I've been doing with my friends and then the eight man raid the last one you kind of do it every week for a token

20:48.200 --> 21:02.200
upgrade your weapons. So I've been working on that as well. Otherwise still working on my Reaper leveling that class, which was one of the new classes they brought out with Endwalker. My Reaper just hit 81 so I can start doing the new dungeons like Tower of Zat and stuff like that.

21:02.200 --> 21:10.200
It's so fun to refer to Tower of Zat and Tower of Babel as like new dungeons when they are influenced by Final Fantasy four. So it's kind of fun.

21:11.200 --> 21:24.200
Otherwise, also, I've been playing No Man's Sky. Not a big shock because you know, I really enjoy that game. However, and I'm sorry, Loki, because I know you have a headline on this later, but I'll just kind of briefly say they added a new expedition into the game.

21:24.200 --> 21:38.200
So I've been playing that. And I was streaming it a little bit a couple of nights anyway. And the interesting thing about it is that it's kind of a roguelike. So it encourages you to die and start the loop over.

21:38.200 --> 21:52.200
So when I did the first night stream was about two and a half hours, and I died right at the beginning because you're supposed to it's actually one of the achievements is dying. But then I died probably about two and a half hours into it because there was a nasty surprise.

21:52.200 --> 22:04.200
I'm just gonna spoiler alert, but you'll thank me later. There is a nasty surprise at the end of the first part of the excellent when you're doing the first phase, you get to a part where you have to activate what looks like a gravestone.

22:04.200 --> 22:21.200
It's one of the little Atlas looking things you activate it. What I was not prepared for were that the scorpion aliens that also show up when you steal eggs showed up to kick my ass and that's how I died. But like any good roguelike, you learn from what you did the first time.

22:21.200 --> 22:50.200
And the second time, I got through it in an hour and 40 minutes and I knew what to expect. So they didn't kill me the second time. Haha. So I got a little further on my second stream that I did on Friday night. I don't know what his time anymore. So I got a little further and but I wrapped it up there because it was starting to get late. So oh yeah, and then the game bugged out on me, which it's not no man's sky if it doesn't get buggy somewhere. But I went I went into a pirate outpost.

22:50.200 --> 23:11.200
And it was all white. There was no color, every shape, every texture was just pure white. And I was like, did I go to heaven? Did I die? Like what happened? And I was like, you know what, this is a good time to quit. And so I did. But I'll stream that again, maybe tomorrow. I don't know what I'm doing for the holiday yet. So maybe a little bit tomorrow. We'll see when I feel like it.

23:11.200 --> 23:41.040
I don't know when I feel like it. Um, also, though, I did play something new. So it wasn't just the same old stuff. I played something new, but it was old. And what I mean is I played Pac Man Museum Plus, because that just came out on Xbox Game Pass. So if you have Game Pass, you can just download it. Otherwise, I think it's on all the other, you know, platforms you'd expect it to be on. And I say it's new old because it is a collection of some older Pac Man games such as the original Pac Man, Super Pac

23:41.040 --> 24:00.000
Man, Pac and Pal, which sucks. I'm just gonna be like Pac and Pal is probably the worst Pac Man game like it just it sucks. Pac Land, Pac Mania, but then it gets some it gets some more of the more recent titles in there to Pac Man 256, which is only about five years old is in there as well. Pac

24:00.000 --> 24:14.960
Man Championship Edition is in there as well. Not in there, Ms. Pac Man. But there's right stuff going on. This is the game where they actually they like changed Ms. Pac Man and some of the other games to what was her name? Pac Mom? Pac Wife?

24:14.960 --> 24:16.080
Oh, right.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.080
Pac Mommy? Will you be my Pac Mommy?

24:20.080 --> 24:21.520
He's a strong, independent woman.

24:21.520 --> 24:29.320
Yeah. So yeah, I don't know who she is now. But she's she's she's not Ms. Pac Man. She's she's Pac Mistress.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.640
She doesn't need to explain herself to anybody.

24:30.840 --> 24:41.240
She doesn't. She doesn't need to. She doesn't need to introduce herself to anyone. She just and what is it? She doesn't have a bow in her hair. She has something else. A hat? I don't remember what it is.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.040
A bee in her bonnet.

24:42.520 --> 24:43.800
I don't remember now.

24:44.520 --> 24:49.000
Does she have a bonnet? Is it does it contain bees? Some sort of insect?

24:49.040 --> 24:57.480
Thank you, Orange Right. She has a hat. It's confirming she's instead of a bow, she has a hat. And it's Pac confirmed. It's Pac Mom. Hat confirmed. Mom confirmed.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.720
Doc or Pac Mom?

25:02.880 --> 25:04.240
Rock'em Sock'em Pac Mom?

25:05.240 --> 25:32.120
So, see, all these games y'all are saying would be amazing if Pac Man would go there, but you know, we're not getting it. Instead, we get Pac in Time. Yes, we get that Pac Man Arrangement, which is actually kind of cool. The whole thing is encased in this inspired by Animal Crossing, I would guess museum, because you actually get to lay out the museum. And as you play the games, you get the little cabinets that you can place throughout the museum. As you get

25:32.120 --> 25:58.640
achievements, your little ghost friends show up in the museum as well. There's a little gacha mechanic where you you know, you it's based off a real thing where you get the little figurines, and you can put the figurines in. So it very much has an Animal Crossing inspired element. It's not that deep. Like it's not Animal Crossing is not that deep. But it's cute. I at first I was sorry, your audio is not coming through for some reason, Doc Sacker. What?

25:59.080 --> 26:00.920
I said ghost friends. I don't know her.

26:01.800 --> 26:30.600
Exactly. Well, I'm used to getting ghosted. So why not have my ghost friends? But um, I the only thing that bugged me at first was I was like, this is such a pain in the ass to find the game I want to play. Like, because like all of the like Pac 256 and championship edition are over at the free game. And then you get coins in the free game to play. Okay, but I learned really quick. So pro tip if you're going to start Pac Man museum plus, if you just hit the

26:30.600 --> 27:00.560
start button, you get a list of everything and you can just pick what you want to play. It's much easier. However, some things are still locked. So like I couldn't play Super Pac Man, underrated Pac Man in my opinion, until I played original Pac Man twice, which isn't that hard to do. Then I can play Super Pac Man. I couldn't play Pac and pal overrated Pac Man until I played Pac Land twice. So there are some weird little unlocks like that, but they're not particularly difficult.

27:00.640 --> 27:30.040
So I guess it's just to try to get you to play a little bit of everything. So cute, I guess. Um, that was my gaming week. Dark Tetsuya says, Okay, that is kind of neat. I do miss the Namco museum atmosphere of just walking around to the really chill music and looking at the exhibits. Thank you, dark Tetsuya. Like honestly, has there been a Namco collection as good as that PlayStation one collection? I don't think so. I really don't. Um,

27:30.080 --> 27:59.800
I would love I don't see this happening, but I'm gonna say it anyway, because it's a podcast. I would love for the entire n a m c o trademark, all of those games to be rereleased in one fucking massive arcade collection released on like PS four, five Xbox switch. I don't give a shit. Just something modern. I would love all of that. That would be so

27:59.800 --> 28:10.840
cool. Dark Sakura, you're a Namco fan. I, I am quite confident you already own the entire Namco museum on PS one. But would you would you be into something like I'm suggesting?

28:11.880 --> 28:16.840
Possibly, yeah. It would all depend on factors. Many factors.

28:17.560 --> 28:34.680
Dark Tetsuya says I know there were a couple on PlayStation two that had a good chunk of those. That is true. And actually, how could I forget? I didn't forget. I'm gonna bring it up. But actually, the Namco collection they had on PlayStation three. While it didn't have as many games on it. I don't know if you all remember.

28:35.320 --> 29:01.960
OLR has a cameo in that game. Somebody on the inside wink, wink, nudge nudge is a fan of OLR. And in the loading screen or something that one of the like tutorial screens will say, what is it you look at the high it says you can compete with your friends online. And it actually shows a high score table. And if you look at the high score table, it says like the initials are like OLR. And then it says like sky, which is the name I was on Twitter for a long time. Dark

29:01.960 --> 29:31.680
Sakura, Loki, so like our names are in it. And then I think I think tingle is on there. Or no, it says tangle or something like like they changed the name slightly of tingle from from, you know, Zelda because they obviously can't use that. But it was something like adjacent. So if you didn't already know that extra name that was on it was supposed to be like tingle. Back to the old end joke of having Loki dress up in a tingle costume. Yeah, they did something like tinkle or something

29:31.680 --> 30:01.040
where it was just slightly different, but it close enough. It was enough. Yeah, it was it was enough to make my little heart happy. And I will say, you know, we're coming up on 20 years OLR, right? Reminder June 26. If you kind of ask going back 20 years of OLR, like what is one of your like greatest achievements? I would say when we showed up in a game like that, even though it was something small, it was something subtle to me. And that's not the only one either. But

30:01.480 --> 30:11.040
I'll let you find the others. Um, the fact that we showed up in a game like that, like just meant the world that was very much like a holy shit, like

30:11.080 --> 30:12.880
that was the we kind of made it moment.

30:12.880 --> 30:30.920
Yeah, that was like the we made it heavy. And you notice not even the podcast award, which was cool, too. Don't get me wrong. But like, that was the moment was like, Oh, shit. Now. Now we're in the game. Now we're in the game. That was the moment that really was. And then of course, and Bobby Blackwell says even yyr wouldn't put

30:30.920 --> 31:00.560
me in his games. I thought there was supposed to be a villain named Blackwolf in one of the games. Maybe I made that up. But um, maybe it wasn't a different OLR dream game came in there. But that was that was certainly the other when yyr actually did bungee ferret tossing. But that came second, if I remember right, when yyr actually did bungee ferret tossing. And that was like a whole game available on the 360 at the time that was made out of an OLR in joke, that was like the same type of thing where it was like,

31:01.080 --> 31:30.840
holy shit, like that was the moment that's it's meta. It's where the gaming podcast very became a game. Sorta. So I love it. So those are those are just some like, those are definitely like some highlights. So yeah, just always, always very thrilling. So all right. There was supposed to be another. I got to go to look that up. I don't know if I don't know if the game came out or what but anyway, I was I was alerted to keep my eyes

31:30.840 --> 31:51.480
out and ears open. But that's all I'll say for now. All right. Before I get in trouble or get I don't want to get anyone else in trouble either for sure. Um, so any better, I better hear about this offline. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Um, all right. Let's get into some more news. However, a lot going on in the industry. Let's get to Loki.

31:52.320 --> 32:19.840
Yes, it's like we get so many different things. Well, most of the stories we've heard about Netflix recently about what are they canceling. So it's nice to know what's something that's being worked on, I guess it's coming at some point. But horizon zero dawn apparently is going to be coming to Netflix as a series of some sort. So that's pretty cool. Obviously, I don't know if they have any sort of

32:19.840 --> 32:49.720
timeline in mind for that. But um, yeah, that would be very interesting, I think, if they do it right. But I don't know, like a big F. Yeah, it would be hard to it's a good property to do it. But like, like, for example, you know, don't do a Paramount Plus did with Halo, you know, actually have people that are making the project, play the games and be familiar with the game.

32:49.840 --> 32:59.680
And not just go, Well, I want to make my own thing in a sci fi world with dinosaur robots, you know, have someone somewhat competent. Put that together, please. Yeah.

32:59.680 --> 33:29.680
Um, questmaster in chat says that twitch tv slash vog network says I can only hope they do it justice. Well, that's what any any gaming fan wants is they want their franchise to be done justice. Like, I don't know, like, when I look at the 90s Mortal Kombat movie, as much as people dislike that movie for various reasons, I sort of look at it and I go but it did the games justice. Like the the 90s games were cheesy, you know, and it gave it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did

33:29.680 --> 33:34.400
do justice, I think, to the series. And I think that's why gamers kind of forgive that movie. And

33:34.400 --> 33:37.680
I'm not talking about the newer Mortal Kombat, which I personally didn't see yet anyway, because

33:37.680 --> 33:43.040
it came out at the height of the pandemic. And it was pretty good to was it I just didn't see it. But

33:43.040 --> 33:48.720
yeah, it doesn't have that cheesy char as like the 90s one, but like, yeah, pretty good. Yeah. Um,

33:48.720 --> 33:53.680
and then also, I'm thinking of Silent Hill. Like, you know, I think like Dark Soccer, I know, you

33:53.680 --> 33:57.520
feel the same way I did where it's like, a lot of people didn't like the movie, but I thought it was

33:57.520 --> 34:04.240
great. Like, especially the sequel. Yeah, well, I have not seen the sequel yet. The sequel is not

34:04.240 --> 34:10.800
as warmly received. But you you, you probably cut it a lot more slack because it does justice for

34:10.800 --> 34:15.360
you to the games. You know, it's based off of Silent Hill three. So that's why I like it.

34:17.280 --> 34:22.960
Now, Funara is my favorite. Yeah. Funara in chat says hopefully by the same kind of people who did

34:22.960 --> 34:27.200
the Witcher bit, even though they were pulling more from the books than the games. Yeah. I mean,

34:27.200 --> 34:31.040
even though the Witcher Yeah, technically, it's based on the books. I think we all know

34:31.040 --> 34:37.600
the games are hugely influential to the show, and so forth. And honestly, the Witcher and the games,

34:37.600 --> 34:42.880
I think are why and the success of the TV show are why we're seeing now horizon Zero Dawn,

34:42.880 --> 34:46.720
we know Final Fantasy 14 got picked up at some point, which I think was also by the

34:46.720 --> 34:51.920
Witcher group, actually. So I'm, can I tell you how interesting the Final Fantasy 14 Oh,

34:51.920 --> 34:55.600
God, if they do it right, if they actually give like each, I don't know if they're going to tell

34:55.680 --> 35:01.040
the same story. But like if they actually give each expansion like its own season.

35:02.720 --> 35:09.920
It's the shadow bringers and the end Walker seasons are going to be so good. I could cry.

35:09.920 --> 35:17.040
Like I just I please like do it as long as they do it justice. That's for sure. Um, but um, yeah,

35:17.040 --> 35:22.240
so there's, there's that. And then I think, we know Mass Effect got changed from the movie,

35:22.240 --> 35:26.160
it was supposed to be 10 years ago or something to now it's going to be a series. And that's,

35:26.160 --> 35:30.560
that's the whole thing too. So yeah, just all and now of course, Halo had a series for better for

35:30.560 --> 35:36.320
worse. Yes. And just all this stuff is getting picked up for series now. So it's it's, it's

35:36.320 --> 35:44.880
interesting how much video games is now impacting the TV world. So and then of course, anime, right?

35:44.880 --> 35:50.160
So Castlevania, and the anime was very well received. And there's other games that are

35:50.160 --> 35:51.680
going that route as well. So

35:52.400 --> 35:57.840
even like I hear the Cuphead shows. All right. Oh, is I don't see I totally forgot that came

35:57.840 --> 36:03.120
out. But yeah, that's kids. Well, my son watched the he binges the whole thing really fast. So

36:03.120 --> 36:09.280
like, I don't know, he apparently enjoyed it. Yeah. I need to watch the new Stranger Things

36:09.280 --> 36:15.120
that just came out just just in time for when I canceled Netflix. Well, there's that and then I

36:15.120 --> 36:20.000
have to watch you know that I don't I'm not a huge fan of like Star Wars stuff. I need to watch

36:20.000 --> 36:26.960
the new Obi Wan series. I watched a little bit of it with Dan and I'm sorry, Leah is sassy and

36:26.960 --> 36:32.560
I love her. Little Leah is the best. Wait, they they have like a new layer.

36:34.000 --> 36:41.600
Well, it's set like before her adulthood. Oh, okay, I get it. Like at right after order

36:42.000 --> 36:45.040
Young Obi Wan like like just after like the

36:46.320 --> 36:49.680
prequels middle age Obi Wan. Okay, I get it. Because I was like,

36:49.680 --> 36:54.480
Carrie Fisher cannot be replaced. And I feel bad for whoever that actress is. But okay. Oh,

36:55.760 --> 36:59.440
this kid does her justice. Okay, that's great to hear. That's great to hear. And yeah,

36:59.440 --> 37:03.040
child is a different scenario. Yeah. So okay, that's neat.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.320
Honestly, her attitude makes me think of

37:06.320 --> 37:14.720
Okay, what was her name in in in chair of swords? That was the the little girl who led the north one

37:14.720 --> 37:18.960
of the north is Aria Stark because is that Aria? I don't remember.

37:22.960 --> 37:23.760
It was an L.

37:25.920 --> 37:30.480
I know. I don't know. I don't know the dragon soap opera. I don't Yes, the wrong person.

37:31.520 --> 37:35.760
It's a good show. She's a badass 10 year old. Okay. All right.

37:36.880 --> 37:42.800
Fair enough. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm hopeful the horizon zero dawn show will not suck because

37:42.800 --> 37:48.000
again, I didn't beat the the new game or the first game, but I enjoyed what I played in the first

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
game. I actually need to go back and beat it like it was good enough for me to go back and play

37:52.000 --> 37:56.160
through at some point. But you know, there's just so many games to play and not enough time. It's

37:56.160 --> 38:01.520
the eternal struggle, right? All right. Too many irons in the fire and not enough hammers.

38:02.400 --> 38:07.520
A song of ice and fire. Is that it? No. All right. I'm thinking of the stupid show because

38:07.520 --> 38:13.600
I started reading the books and hated them. Let's move on. Speaking of things that were hated by a

38:13.600 --> 38:19.040
lot of people. Some nasty news was out earlier this week that had come out of Asia, where

38:19.040 --> 38:25.360
PlayStation Plus the new version was going live, where some folks who gamed the system early on

38:25.360 --> 38:30.320
basically stacking up their time that we're going to be converted to get the highest tier of

38:30.320 --> 38:37.760
PlayStation now at a lower price. We're getting hit with an upgrade tax, dun dun dun. But it

38:37.760 --> 38:44.080
actually came out and I will quickly add to the story that Sony came out and said, Oh, it was a

38:44.080 --> 38:51.120
mistake. This pricing pricing fiasco was an error. In a tweet was the official asked PlayStation

38:51.120 --> 38:56.320
account said due to a technical error, players in Asia who have previously purchased a PlayStation

38:56.320 --> 39:00.880
Plus membership and a discount have been incorrectly charged for their upgrade pricing.

39:00.880 --> 39:05.280
This error has been fixed and impacted players will receive a credit. We thank you for your

39:05.280 --> 39:10.320
patience. Okay, I'm glad they fixed it. And that's the important thing at the end of the day.

39:11.360 --> 39:18.880
You can't help but wonder, were they gonna find multiple people in chat put mistake in quotes,

39:18.880 --> 39:25.200
you have to wonder, would they have been so quick to find that mistake? If social media and gaming

39:25.200 --> 39:30.800
media had not pointed it out for them? multiple times? You have to wonder,

39:31.680 --> 39:39.200
oh, our bad that we got caught. Oops. Now, some other news coming out of the launch of

39:39.200 --> 39:44.480
PlayStation Plus in or the you know, the new PlayStation Plus in Asia is that the classic

39:44.480 --> 39:51.600
games, some of them are the PAL versions, which you may recall was a lot of the shit that the

39:51.600 --> 39:59.440
PlayStation classic got in trouble for. I should say they don't all use PAL regions. But some of

39:59.440 --> 40:05.360
them do. So for example, ape escape was one that was noted, I think a I don't think the cloud

40:05.360 --> 40:10.240
service had completely rolled out. But ape escape was somehow available. So a Twitter user actually

40:10.240 --> 40:16.400
grabbed it and found, oh, it runs at the PAL frame rate, which is actually a lower frame rate. So

40:16.400 --> 40:23.200
it's a 50 hertz frame rate instead of 60. Well, once again, because social media is so quick to

40:23.200 --> 40:30.480
point this out, I believe Sony actually put out some type of patch to try to correct this. But it

40:30.480 --> 40:39.040
made it worse. Because they're trying to force the 5060 frames a second through some sort of I don't

40:39.040 --> 40:44.320
know, like, like, basically machine learning or whatever to put it out there. And it's not actually

40:44.400 --> 40:48.800
just the PAL version. So I don't know why they just can't emulate the fucking PAL version. I

40:48.800 --> 40:54.400
don't know what's holding them back. Some people were speculating is it because maybe the region

40:54.400 --> 41:01.360
that this was released in is it defaulted to NTSC? I don't know. But it's an issue that should be

41:01.360 --> 41:09.920
dealt with now. ape escape, hotshots golf, jumping flash, all were observed to be using PAL. But

41:10.640 --> 41:18.240
Tekken two was NTSC. So and considering Tekken two is a fighting game. That's some good news.

41:19.280 --> 41:26.000
But that is that is I don't know, it's just weird that this is happening. And that you would think

41:26.000 --> 41:33.280
somebody Sony kind of realizes this is an issue, right? I don't know. I'm dark to see you didn't

41:33.280 --> 41:38.640
really know. Yeah, didn't Nintendo give Europe the 60 hertz versions? Anyway, I'm pretty sure

41:38.640 --> 41:44.000
because now that everything is high definition television, all of that stuff is out the window.

41:44.720 --> 41:51.200
The reason why this was all an issue to begin with is because the old CRT televisions were different

41:51.200 --> 41:59.040
between Europe and the US. And I believe Asia had the same type of TVs we had here in the US.

41:59.040 --> 42:00.080
Yeah, they're NTSC.

42:00.080 --> 42:05.680
Yeah. But the PAL TVs over in Europe. That's why whenever you see like an old episode of Doctor

42:05.680 --> 42:11.440
Who, or if you ever watched old BBC stuff that they would play on PBS, it looked different,

42:11.440 --> 42:16.080
like it kind of looked weird, right? That's because it was converted from PAL and PAL had

42:16.080 --> 42:21.600
a different resolution as well. PAL was a slight wasn't like 20 pixels bigger. I remember right.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.480
For refresh rate.

42:24.480 --> 42:29.040
Yeah, it was just it was refresh rate. Yeah. So now Oh, yeah. And then there was C cam.

42:29.040 --> 42:35.120
I forgot about C cam. That was in. Was that in other non Japan, Asia territories? I can't

42:35.120 --> 42:42.320
remember where C cam was. It was somewhere else. But um, yeah, there was that third format. So

42:43.280 --> 42:48.000
yeah, D'Arcy says I remember the whole policy cam thing back in the 90s. I read about it all the

42:48.000 --> 42:52.880
time and mags back then. Yep. Zen monkey says I don't blame Sony for trying to take advantage of

42:52.880 --> 42:59.680
an exploit. Gamers are ripping them off. So they tried to balance out. I think I think what was

42:59.680 --> 43:05.840
pissing people off was that you were kind of forced into it. So like, Sony should have at

43:05.840 --> 43:10.720
least given the I mean, obviously, they reverse course, but they should have like had the option

43:10.720 --> 43:15.440
or they should have done something where it's like, hey, since you bought it at this lower rate,

43:15.440 --> 43:21.520
it's converted to the amount that you actually bought from the real prices. I don't know. They

43:21.520 --> 43:25.360
probably could have done that. And people would have been like, Oh, sucks, but they would have

43:25.360 --> 43:32.880
dealt with it. You know, Pele Hanumea points out my Amiga monitor could handle PAL, but the bottom

43:32.880 --> 43:40.240
of the PAL games were cut off. Yeah, the Commodore platforms in particular are interesting because

43:40.240 --> 43:45.520
they were bigger in Europe than they were over here in the US. So a lot of it was kind of, you

43:45.520 --> 43:53.360
know, focused to that. So just kind of interesting. A game I've been playing is a PAL game. But I

43:53.360 --> 44:00.320
haven't noticed any cutoff. It could be the the PAL dialogue. The European dialogue applied to

44:00.320 --> 44:06.880
the Japanese version. Yeah, yeah. But which now now I'm playing it. I know why it never came out

44:06.880 --> 44:15.600
over here. It's a little dark and more than that tons of religious iconery and iconography and tons

44:15.600 --> 44:22.240
of questionable speech. It's been a long time since I played it. And I don't think I got I only

44:22.240 --> 44:28.160
beat Soul Blazer and got most of the way through Gaia. Terranigma, obviously the one not actually

44:28.160 --> 44:32.720
released here. I got the least furthest and I played it but not not as much as you have at this

44:32.720 --> 44:42.160
point. It just made it to America. And I just I spent the whole time like on my Wednesday stream

44:42.160 --> 44:48.560
yelling at Columbus, who was completely different characterization, of course, in the game, you know,

44:48.560 --> 44:53.040
fictional everything. But I was like, No, you don't want to spread love between nations. You

44:53.040 --> 44:56.000
were trying to take people over and money and colonization and blah, blah, blah. I was just

44:56.000 --> 45:01.120
like going off on him. History lesson. All right. How much further do you have to go? You think?

45:02.320 --> 45:08.080
I don't know. I'm not looking ahead on purpose. Fair enough. I know. You don't want a spoiler.

45:08.080 --> 45:13.360
So it's fine. Yeah. All right. Let's move on. We have more stories. Dark Soccer, I believe the next

45:13.360 --> 45:21.760
one is yours. Also, Sony. Well, I remember how there was the whole gender discrimination lawsuit

45:21.760 --> 45:30.800
and we brought it up several times in light of Activision. Well, to go over a little bit more

45:30.800 --> 45:39.360
about this. It was a an employee named Emma, is it Majo or Majo? I don't know offhand, who was

45:39.360 --> 45:51.200
an IT analyst, had filed a suit against Sony in November of 2021. That, you know, just basically

45:51.200 --> 45:55.040
going over some of the same stuff we've already talked about, about women being paid less, denied

45:55.040 --> 46:00.800
promotions, usually that type of thing. And then there were more allegations, of course, that came

46:00.800 --> 46:07.680
out. Eight more employees came out and said it. The federal judge had ultimately moved to dismiss

46:07.680 --> 46:13.200
the lawsuit in April, citing a lack of specific facts. But certain elements of the case could

46:13.200 --> 46:21.440
proceed, specifically those relating to her dismissal from PlayStation and violations of

46:21.440 --> 46:26.960
whistleblower protections. Those could be resubmitted with more detail. And that's what she

46:26.960 --> 46:32.160
did. She did an amended version of the lawsuit with a narrower focus, has been submitted to the

46:32.160 --> 46:37.840
California court, this time seeking damages for all women who worked at PlayStation's California

46:37.840 --> 46:45.040
locations below the vice president level, rather than for all female PlayStation

46:45.040 --> 46:52.880
employees across the U.S. The allegations are very similar, but basically going, you know, that

46:52.880 --> 46:58.400
women were passed up for promotion in favor of male colleagues, unequal pay, retaliation. But now

46:58.400 --> 47:03.520
it explicitly adds, and I'm quoting here, more specific facts about the class-wide policies and

47:03.520 --> 47:09.200
practices which institutionalized gender-based discrimination and gender-based harassment.

47:11.680 --> 47:17.440
These are also including some of the declarations that were made by the other employees who came

47:17.440 --> 47:23.680
forward. And then a Deloitte study in which Sony was found to have a very low percentage of women

47:23.680 --> 47:30.480
in management positions compared to its peers. Sony has not made a comment on it yet. So we'll

47:30.480 --> 47:36.160
see how this plays out. This isn't something Sony is just going to be able to blink and make go away

47:36.160 --> 47:41.200
though, because it's not often you hear about a lawsuit being dismissed, but then coming back with

47:41.200 --> 47:47.040
kind of like the extra stuff to push it forward. So that's kind of what makes this particular

47:47.040 --> 47:51.200
piece, I think, interesting is that, you know, since it was dismissed before, but now it's like,

47:51.200 --> 47:55.440
no, we have the additional information needed. So it's going to be interesting to see where this

47:55.440 --> 48:01.280
ends up. And Sony is definitely going to have to acknowledge it. And yeah, usually, you know, they

48:02.720 --> 48:08.640
were getting into that E3 time of year. Sony historically has not had a lot of women on stage.

48:08.640 --> 48:17.840
So it'd be interesting to see how they respond to that. All right. But until we have more info from

48:17.840 --> 48:21.440
the courts, which will probably be years away, let's be real. I'm not sure there's a lot else

48:21.440 --> 48:25.040
we can say on that. So for now, we'll go to our next story. Loki.

48:26.560 --> 48:33.360
Yeah, so Sony is looking to bring some more of their titles to PC. And you may remember,

48:33.360 --> 48:40.560
they've been doing that quite often with lots of past titles, including I'm trying to think I know,

48:40.560 --> 48:45.520
I think Horizon was on its way to PC already. And then they've uncharted and all that stuff.

48:45.920 --> 48:51.120
But no, they've already announced that they're going to be including quite a few of the first

48:51.120 --> 49:00.560
party titles. So Ratchet and Clank, God of War, they're bringing uncharted last of us. And I'm not

49:00.560 --> 49:05.520
sure what else they're looking to bring a horizon Forbidden West, of course, they publish that.

49:06.800 --> 49:13.760
But yeah, and this is, um, I know that they're they're also are data miners had also found

49:13.760 --> 49:21.120
returnal was one that was slated for a PC port as well. But the fact that they're bringing more

49:21.120 --> 49:26.160
to PC is great. Especially since I can't get PlayStation five. Yeah, I was gonna say the

49:26.160 --> 49:30.320
returnal is a really big deal. Because that's a PlayStation five exclusive. You can't play that

49:30.320 --> 49:35.760
on PlayStation four. So the fact that that could possibly be something that you could play through

49:35.760 --> 49:42.080
PC would be pretty great, I think. So we'll see what comes to that. But I'd be into that.

49:43.040 --> 49:49.600
Yeah, probably why also why this isn't really such a surprise, but they had an investor call

49:49.600 --> 49:57.680
that they said that no first party games will be released on PlayStation five in 2025. But they're

49:57.680 --> 50:04.560
not planning on letting the platform die. I think you meant to say PlayStation four. No, no, I'm

50:04.560 --> 50:10.480
sorry, PlayStation four. Yeah. So they're not gonna not gonna be releasing on 20 in 2025. So that's

50:10.480 --> 50:15.040
still a few years away. But so in the meantime, they're planning on supporting PlayStation four,

50:15.600 --> 50:19.920
for at least a few more years, probably because there's no PlayStation fives available.

50:20.800 --> 50:26.080
They got to make money somehow. And they are making money quite, or they are selling quite a

50:26.080 --> 50:31.120
few of those units, at least on PlayStation four. Wonder if we'll see in like, well, they've already

50:31.120 --> 50:36.720
done like a redesign of PlayStation four, probably not another redesign, but maybe PlayStation five

50:36.720 --> 50:41.920
redesign. No, people are kind of excited about something like that. And the Xbox series X and S

50:41.920 --> 50:46.320
redesigns here. There was buzz about that earlier this week with absolutely no information

50:46.320 --> 50:53.200
whatsoever on it just, I think people just kind of feel like it's the time for it. But, you know,

50:53.200 --> 50:58.320
and I would I would definitely say, you know, from the old calendars, this would be about the year

50:58.320 --> 51:04.080
you would see like a PlayStation hardware refresh or something. But I think the combination of the

51:04.080 --> 51:10.080
pandemic, leading to the ship chip shortage, leading to why we can't have PlayStation fives

51:10.080 --> 51:15.280
very easily. I'm not sure it's going to make that easy, especially if PlayStation VR two

51:15.920 --> 51:21.040
is happening this year. That seems like a bit of a whammy to hit in the same year,

51:21.680 --> 51:27.360
asking people to get a PlayStation VR two and a PS five Pro, I'm using my quoting fingers,

51:27.360 --> 51:32.960
whatever it is, that's a lot for one year. So I feel like it's it's one or the other, not both.

51:34.960 --> 51:38.320
Yeah. And also, I think that would be confusing, too, because you're going to have

51:38.320 --> 51:42.000
basically three skews at that point. You're at the PlayStation four that you're still supporting

51:42.000 --> 51:46.240
until twenty twenty five, your regular PlayStation five and your PlayStation five

51:46.240 --> 51:50.800
pro would get confusing. Yeah. Not to say that they don't do that sort of weird

51:50.800 --> 51:57.520
tearing things on their services already. So sure. Why not? Why not? Sony probably sells

51:57.520 --> 52:01.520
40 times types of televisions. Why not three PlayStations? Yeah, they're going to they're

52:01.520 --> 52:04.640
going to support the PlayStation four until twenty twenty five. It's only going to output,

52:04.640 --> 52:09.200
though, a power resolutions and power refresh rates. So going forward, it's just saying,

52:09.200 --> 52:14.880
beware of that. E3 VL in our chat points out it's easier to get PlayStation fives than before

52:15.520 --> 52:19.600
GameStop and Wal-Mart have been doing events. Yeah, I've been generally hearing that, too,

52:19.600 --> 52:24.960
that it's getting a little easier to get your hands on one. I just have at this point,

52:24.960 --> 52:30.960
I'm not going to buy one until after the summer season because I need Sony to confirm

52:31.520 --> 52:35.120
that they're not doing a hardware upgrade this year and then probably I'll buy one.

52:35.120 --> 52:40.640
Well, I just I need one for five se 16. So whenever if 16 is coming out this year,

52:40.640 --> 52:44.400
then fuck it. I'm buying a PlayStation five. But if it's not coming out this year,

52:44.400 --> 52:49.280
I might still wait, especially with this news about the PC stuff and that everything is still

52:49.280 --> 52:55.360
on PlayStation four. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. Yeah. Yeah. Quest Busters in the same boat

52:55.360 --> 52:59.360
as me. It's a good boat and there's lots of room in this boat. I think there's a lot of us in it.

52:59.360 --> 53:06.640
So all right. Well, when we might figure out more information could be Sony's state of play event,

53:06.640 --> 53:12.560
which is scheduled for June 2, that's next week. So I don't know if this is supposed to be their

53:12.560 --> 53:18.320
E3 replacement or what. It's only a 30 minute broadcast, but you can still put a lot of

53:18.320 --> 53:23.440
information in 30 minutes and maybe, you know, honestly, honestly, truly, if you take the fluff

53:24.320 --> 53:28.320
out of a 60 minute presentation, 90 minute presentation, you probably only have about

53:28.320 --> 53:34.960
30 minutes left. So it'll be interesting to see what happens. They are saying new game reveals,

53:34.960 --> 53:40.880
sneak peeks, updates, and they are including in that some exciting reveals from our third

53:40.880 --> 53:46.960
party partners. And they are confirming a sneak peek at several games in development for PlayStation

53:46.960 --> 53:54.880
VR two, which makes me think PS VR two is this year. But I could be wrong. And that's, that's

53:54.880 --> 53:59.600
okay. But if I feel like if they're starting to show off those games, then that hardware is

53:59.600 --> 54:04.640
probably a little sooner rather than later, especially if it will just inherently support

54:04.640 --> 54:09.600
the PlayStation four VR library. You know, then that way, it's already going to have a library

54:09.600 --> 54:14.640
when this comes out. So it'll be interesting to see what happens. Again, it's June 2, it's going

54:14.640 --> 54:20.000
to be three o'clock Pacific, six o'clock Eastern. So sadly, that's still during the workday for me,

54:20.000 --> 54:25.520
which is kind of annoying. So I'm not sure I can actually watch it live here on vogue, although

54:26.160 --> 54:36.720
that is that's Thursday, I might be able to swing it. But no promises. So e3 vl says probably a

54:36.720 --> 54:43.280
teaser for Summer Games Fest a week later, I don't expect Sony is going to be participating at the

54:43.280 --> 54:48.640
same level at Summer Games Fest. I'm sure they will maybe have something thrown in there. But

54:48.720 --> 54:55.520
probably they'll rely on their partners. ie Kojima, if Kojima is really up to something,

54:55.520 --> 54:59.600
whatever it is, be it that they're going to confirm the Death Stranding sequel or

55:00.240 --> 55:06.400
heaven forbid, the fans are going to get their way and he's involved with something meteor is that

55:06.400 --> 55:10.480
that might be the place to confirm that. But that would probably be more of a third party announcement

55:10.480 --> 55:14.800
type of thing. Although, I guess there was also that rumor going around that Sony might just

55:14.800 --> 55:21.360
straight up bottom. So I don't know. We'll have to wait and see. We will have to wait and see and

55:21.360 --> 55:26.320
y'all will just have to deal with waiting. Um, one thing you do get to see on Friday, though.

55:26.880 --> 55:30.960
So again, now that we don't have e3 anymore, companies are kind of doing this whenever they

55:30.960 --> 55:38.480
want. Sega is going to be doing an event on June 3. It's it. I believe that's eight o'clock in

55:38.480 --> 55:44.000
Japan. That's going to be early morning for us. I don't know that quite the time conversion,

55:44.000 --> 55:50.400
but it's going to be early early morning. Sega is going to do a Sega new project announcement

55:50.400 --> 55:56.080
live stream. You can watch it on YouTube, Nico Nico and Twitter it is available there.

55:58.800 --> 56:04.960
No idea what could be here. But a Twitter user has observed that the presenter lineup is the same

56:04.960 --> 56:12.400
as the Genesis and Mega Drive mini live stream. So could it be something where we have more

56:12.960 --> 56:18.960
Sega retro collection things coming? Who knows? I would you know, we've heard that Sega wants

56:18.960 --> 56:24.800
to revive some of their old stuff like potentially crazy taxi jet set radio, things like that.

56:24.800 --> 56:28.880
I think we'd all be extremely happy to hear a new jet set radios coming but

56:29.760 --> 56:35.440
keep keep your expectations manageable. It's probably another Sonic game. No. Well,

56:35.440 --> 56:41.360
it also in all seriousness, Sonic does have that. You know, everything's going open world now.

56:41.360 --> 56:45.200
Sonic has that open world game coming out. But I don't I don't think this is about that because

56:45.200 --> 56:49.280
they they've already announced it and they would have just said it's a stream about the new Sonic

56:49.280 --> 56:54.640
game. But they're saying this is a new project announcement. So orange right says wait to hear

56:54.640 --> 57:02.320
about their NFTs. You need to take that back right now. Orange right in chat says clearly

57:02.320 --> 57:08.240
it's going to be the Dreamcast to JK you joke but if it was like a mini Dreamcast I think we'd all

57:08.240 --> 57:16.560
be there for that. I mean, hell yeah. Speaking of NFTs, because it didn't hit the show roll

57:16.560 --> 57:20.240
anywhere else. Did you hear about Bobby Blackwell's favorite series?

57:22.880 --> 57:33.680
No, Nino Cooney just launched a mobile PC gotcha kind of title. And apparently it's it's it doesn't

57:33.680 --> 57:38.800
have NFTs in it yet. But people have observed on their roadmap. It is something that's coming to

57:38.800 --> 57:45.760
the game. I have some friends on Twitter that got into it before that news came out. But I,

57:45.760 --> 57:50.480
I was like, I'm not going to play another gotcha game right now. I'm just I'm just not.

57:52.320 --> 57:56.400
All right, everybody in chat is saying no, no, it's all right, fine. I'll talk about something

57:56.400 --> 58:02.240
else. Questbuster does point out it's by net marble, which who depending on who you talk

58:02.240 --> 58:07.360
to and gotcha circles is automatically a red flag. All right, let's move on. We,

58:08.080 --> 58:14.240
we need to we need to talk about games from before the NFT era. So Dark Sakura four times. Yeah.

58:16.720 --> 58:28.880
So this is rumor-y. This is conjecture. This is but in PlayStation Plus in Asian regions,

58:29.760 --> 58:37.520
they saw artwork for Dino Crisis, the original Dino Crisis. The game is not in the catalog.

58:38.800 --> 58:45.120
But actually, with the launch this week, it has fewer games that they than they expected to have.

58:45.840 --> 58:49.920
But if the lead character for Dino Crisis is used on the cover,

58:50.720 --> 58:56.720
highlighting the classic games, then the theory is going that Dino Crisis may be among them.

58:57.520 --> 59:03.120
And it's a pretty convincing screenshot. Just looking it over. I mean, it's

59:04.560 --> 59:08.960
where they go to classics catalog. She is their face and everybody.

59:12.000 --> 59:18.480
So they're thinking that it is going to be coming out eventually. And I don't know what's

59:19.200 --> 59:22.880
there. Yeah, it's it's so at any rate, it's a fair conclusion to jump to,

59:22.880 --> 59:27.840
I think. No, no, no, um, some music started playing on my side, which only I could hear,

59:27.840 --> 59:34.720
I'm sorry. But at any rate, I mean, we've had people asking for this game to be released in

59:34.720 --> 59:40.960
some form or another for a while. I mean, it almost seems that the I mean, well, it was

59:40.960 --> 59:48.000
actually just abandoned the whole IP there. So if we can have it coming back, that would be pretty

59:48.000 --> 59:56.640
nice. All right. Let's listen evil is having this big surge of happy popularity. Why not Dino

59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.600
Crisis? Why not? And then you know what, we can get a dinosaur killer in dead by daylight.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:08.240
I'm all for that. You hear me behavior? Why not steal my ideas? Hire me? Why not a tie in with

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:12.880
Jurassic Park? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Jurassic Park dead by daylight. You ready? The

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:20.080
killer the velociraptor, although it could be the T or X, whatever. But the survivor is Laura Dern.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.600
I just got Laura Dern in a video game needs to happen.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.440
It did to the other one could be Malcolm.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.280
It could be Yeah, that's true. It's true. Malcolm. Jeff Goldblum is Malcolm would be

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:36.480
good. Jeff Goldblum. I think Laura is Ellie or something like that. But yeah, I would I would,

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.400
like I just when I think of dead by daylight and gay rights, and it is Pride Month.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.000
Laura Dern needs to be in the game.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.800
So kind of hope we get the Babadook.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:55.760
I'd love that. All right. Orange right does point out the T Rex would be too big. But then again,

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.680
they said the same thing about Ridley. Well, that's that's why I went for a velociraptor.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:05.280
They they do all have to be built on a humanoid skeleton. Even the dredge is built on a humanoid

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.840
skeleton. I looked at the the the armature for it. Yeah, demo dog, because there are

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.480
common animations. Yeah. But actually, I'll tell you what's really funny is taking the

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.440
wraith skeleton and applying it to the pig. She just sort of hangs there really tall with her

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:28.480
head to the side. But But yeah, going back to the actual story. It'd be cool. People will be happy

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.000
about it. I don't see how you could go. Nevermind. I'm not going to say that because I know how they

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.240
could go wrong with it. But there you go. Before we get to our next story, a tip from

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.640
Phanara in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network. This isn't in our show role,

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:48.720
but it's a worthy headline that if you are a user of the epic game store, the Bioshock collection is

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:52.320
the free giveaway this week. So make sure to grab that. Thank you for the reminder. I hadn't grabbed

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.440
that yet. I got Borderlands. I thought it was just Bioshock three. No, it's the whole collection.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.480
It's the collection. Yeah. It's one to an infinite. Yeah. So which I've already got

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:07.680
the others. And I have to go grab the others. I believe collection would be the HD remasters

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.880
on top of that. So because Yeah, yeah, they they remastered the one and two at some point. So yeah,

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:18.080
it's definitely worth picking up if you don't already have it. So cool. All right, makes makes

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:22.400
me wonder if they're finally about to announce another one because you know, supposedly he's

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:28.800
been working on one for a while. And summer's coming up. And that's when they announce new

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.400
stuff. And actually, this brings I just thought of a problem with them doing Dino crisis. Hmm.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.680
The dinosaurs are so inaccurate now now that we know that they all had feathers.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:46.000
Oh, they'd have to completely redo all the dinosaurs. They are doing that in Jurassic Park.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.000
I know. Well, they're wrong. Well, it could it doesn't have to be right.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:55.200
You know, if you could tell you what because they combined it with frog DNA or something like that.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:02.240
So it kind of does bug me now though, going back and seeing all these representatives of what

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:09.200
people thought they look like and now actually knowing no, they're giant chickens. Giant chickens.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.680
I'm not I'm not taking you to see 80s horror movies and all the all the things they get

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:24.080
wrong about a multitude of things creatures. Blood physics, those dinosaurs were real.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.560
That's true. They were they were I mean, humans didn't live with dinosaurs. That's a myth. But

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:37.200
you know, this wasn't the Flintstones. Alright, moving on, let's get into a few more stories for

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.960
you. And then we'll get to the classic game of the week. And all I'm going to say I'm not going

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:45.280
to give it away. But I'm just going to say this week selection is one of those games where you're

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:51.760
going to go. Oh, not this. This isn't this isn't old enough. This is not old enough.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.840
I'll leave you on that note. Hold on. For now, Loki.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:02.800
Yes. So the there's members at Activision Blizzard, the employees have formed a new

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:10.720
committee to try to combat the sexism, inequality and gender bias that they've experienced at the

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:18.160
studio. I know surprising. The workplace responsibility committee. They have a four

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:25.360
page document that basically includes their demands. And that includes a private lactation

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:31.040
support 12 weeks of paid parental leave the implementation of independent investigations

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:38.880
for employee complaints and incidents. Yeah, I wonder why they would need that. You know,

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.080
but yeah, it's it's nice to see these groups kind of more organizing, although you know,

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.280
it would really help them a little bit better as if they just had a union across the whole company.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.360
I think we're going to get there. It's just a matter of time.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:06.240
We'll see. So the 12 weeks paid off or time off for parental leave is basically opposed to the

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.720
10 weeks that they currently get. So they're asking for more benefits in that sense.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.880
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, especially with all the eyes kind of on Activision right now

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:24.000
with all of the allegations coming out from them. I mean, it might help them with some of this

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.320
momentum, right? And what they're asking for is certainly not unreasonable. Like you might be

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.400
sitting there going, gosh, you're asking for this is actually there's there's a lot of companies out

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.120
there that have these sorts of you know, benefits for employees since you know, that's how you get

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.080
a company of those type of benefits make you want to work or for an employee or for an employer and

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.640
stay loyal to it when they have those sorts of things. So you know, and especially when people

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.560
are abandoning about Activision Blizzard left and right because of everything the company's been

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.320
going through. I don't think these sorts of protections are too much to ask quite frankly.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:02.640
So all right. Well, moving on before we get to the classic game of the week, let's talk about

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:08.000
a classic archive because I think this is pretty cool. And it's being done by an Embracer group,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.240
which is also known as THQ Nordic back in the day. And plus, you know, you hadn't heard of

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:22.080
Embracer group a lot recently until that whole recent acquisition of the Square Enix West Coast

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:28.320
stuff. Or not West Coast, what am I saying? Sorry, Square Enix, like, well, because Crystal Dynamics

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:33.120
is on the West Coast, there's some other but like Montreal and all that stuff, the stuff in

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.960
the Americas, basically, that Embracer took from Square Enix. But Embracer is doing some other

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:44.480
stuff as well, including the Embracer games archive, where they want to save as much of the

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:51.520
games industry as possible. They have a whole new website, Embracer.com slash about slash games

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:58.560
archive. And that is a place where they kind of show you more about what this archive is all

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:02.400
about. It's not really an online archive, it's actually a physical archive. And you can see lots

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:09.360
of pictures there. They have already archived 50,000 games, consoles and accessories. If you

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:13.840
want to visit the hub, though, and I'm not hearing it's open to the public yet. But if you want to

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.640
visit the hub, it's in Karlstad, Sweden, to have a little trip to make for most of you out there.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.920
But the archive does have a CEO, an archive assistant, a technical engineer and a supply

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:29.280
manager. So Embracer is putting money into this by paying those salaries. And that's worth noting

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:33.520
is that they're, they're putting their money where their mouth is literally, which is kind of neat

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:38.640
with that. They're trying to build a database, and they're going to be cataloging, they're hoping to

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:44.400
network and collaborate with initiatives, museums and institutions. And they also do intend to

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:51.360
exhibit part of the archive locally and with like traveling satellite exhibitions, basically,

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:57.120
they do not have a wanted list of things they need yet. But if a collector wants to get in touch,

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:03.520
they sure would like to hear from you. In a comment, David Bostrom said, Imagine a place

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.400
this is CEO, imagine a place where physical video games, consoles and accessories are gathered at

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:13.120
the same place. And think about how much that could mean for games culture and enabling video

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:18.960
games research. This journey has just been started. And we're at an early stage at Embracer

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.800
games archive, we believe that games carry a heritage we're celebrating and safeguarding for

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.600
the future. Our goal is clear, we want to archive and save as much of the video games industry as

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:34.080
possible. So that's pretty neat that they are doing that. And I will say this, it's basically

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:39.920
like dark soccer as vault, but like on a much larger scale. So what this is, it's pretty cool.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:47.440
So very cool. The vault is kind of downscaled unless you add the pinballs to it, then they're

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:52.000
all going to be in the garage. Fair enough. Fair enough. All right. Well, as promised,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.440
we're going to take a trip down memory lane in our next segment.

01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:11.520
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.480
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.080
And dark soccer, what did you pick tonight?

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:29.760
There we go, sorry. I picked Journey. I'd hit the button, but it didn't trigger it.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.400
That's right.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:34.720
Yeah, not the old Journey, which I've already done. Not Journey to Syllabus,

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.600
which I've already done. But Journey that came out in 2012.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.600
So yes, this game is 10 years old, and we're all having a moment.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.080
Well, you might. I'm not.

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:46.560
I am.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:54.320
Um, so it came out in North America on March 13, 2021, and in Europe on March 14,

01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:01.520
2021, probably because they actually did get a simultaneous release, and it was time difference.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:09.040
So it is an indie adventure game that was made by That Game Company and Santa Monica Studio,

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:15.760
published by Sony, directed by Jenova Chen. It was released on PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:21.360
Network, and then ported to PS4 July 2015, and then on Windows and iOS.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.160
So when you play Journey, you're playing a robed figure

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.280
who is traveling toward a mountain. And other people are playing at the same time.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:39.360
And they don't tell you first that you're playing a multiplayer game.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:45.360
You run into other robed figures. And sometimes you help them.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.240
And sometimes you ignore them or they ignore you.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.640
But the whole thing is that the only way that you have to communicate with each other is a

01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:03.280
little musical chime. And it will change this cloth that you find in different levels into

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:09.040
this vibrant red. And it allows you to progress through the levels.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:18.480
They wanted to try to evoke these emotions and the sense of bonding with people as you go through.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:24.800
And the music also dynamically responds to your actions. So you have a single theme,

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:34.160
but with variations as you go through. Honestly, it won many Game of the Year awards.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:41.280
It won Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Actually, no, it got a nomination for Best Score

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:50.080
Soundtrack for Visual Media in the 2013 Grammys. There is a collector's edition that has the other

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:55.520
of that game company's previous titles and other media that came out in August 2012.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:03.600
So it's all wordless. The cutscenes are just visual.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.240
I don't really want to go into spoilers on it, because I do think that if people haven't played

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.480
it, they really should sit down and do it. But you can play through the whole thing in

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:21.680
two or three hours, if I recall correctly. Now, going into the development of this one.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:28.400
Now, the first two games that that game company did was Flow and Flower. And I played Flower.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:32.080
Did you ever play Flower? I did. It's great.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:41.200
And so the development for Journey started in 2009 after Flower was released. And they had an

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:47.120
18-person development team, mostly people who worked on the previous two games.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:59.440
But basically, Sony wanted the game done in a year rather than the three. But they knew that

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.880
they would need an extension on this one, because doing it in a year was unrealistic.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:09.600
It took even longer than they thought it would, because the communication aspect really was what

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.360
took a lot of effort. And then the team was originally like seven people and grew to 18

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:21.280
people. And then Sony's extension ran out, but the game still didn't bring the emotions that

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:27.440
they wanted. So Sony gave them one more year and exceeded even that. The project, though,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:34.960
was causing a lot of problems, a lot of stress, a lot of arguments. They had to reduce over time

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:42.480
because of project burnout. And then they had almost been driven to bankruptcy in the final

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:51.440
months of development, and some of the developers had gone unpaid. Because the whole thing is that

01:13:53.520 --> 01:14:00.800
for them to just get it out, they had to basically let the game go. Just finish it

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:06.480
and learning to let go of those ideas that they couldn't make it into the game

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.720
and just work well together. And that ended up actually kind of going into the theme of the game.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:16.240
The whole point was to make you feel small and give you this sense of awe about where you were.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:26.560
It wanted to move beyond the competitive nature of most games. And there actually was a prototype

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:35.280
called Dragon that had players trying to draw away a large monster, but they discarded it when

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:42.560
it was basically players were ignoring each other to do their own objectives. And so they designed

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:48.960
Journey as, well, their analogy for it was like a Japanese garden where they remove all the elements

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:55.360
that didn't fit so that the emotions would stay. It was very minimalist. With that minimalist

01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:03.760
approach, with it being less complicated, it was perfect, basically. They said that three of their

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:12.880
25 testers cried when they finished the game. It is based off of Middle Eastern concepts,

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:19.040
some Arabic culture, some of the architecture, and also a little bit of Chinese and Tibetan

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:25.840
cultural influences. Of course, that comes from Chen's background. And they wanted it to be fully

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:34.240
cooperative without forcing it and they wanted to eliminate all need of competition. You know,

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:43.360
they felt that caring about the other player could be diluted by too much going on in the game

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.880
and that they wanted to show the positive side of humanity.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:57.760
So when this came out, there was the PlayStation Home Game Space. There was, you know, that came out

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:02.720
with the release of the game. The Collector's Edition retail one came out in August, like I said

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:08.480
earlier. There's also, like I said with that, they also released Flow and Flower with director

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:14.880
commentaries, art galleries, and soundtracks of all the games, non-related mini games, and

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:20.080
more content for PlayStation 3. And then they did a hardcover book called The Art of Journey.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:32.720
And then it kept coming out and basically the port that came out for Windows and iOS

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:41.600
was done by Annapurna Interactive. The music was done by Austin Wintory,

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:48.240
who also worked on Flow. And he worked with the sound designer because they wanted all of these

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:57.200
actions to be interactive, a little bit more like what you have. Like I said earlier,

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.920
as you do certain things in the game, the music is going to switch over to a variation.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:10.240
And the soundtrack is actually available on iTunes and PlayStation Network.

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:18.560
And it, like I said, it was also Grammy nominated. There's also, this in 2012, there was a download

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:25.200
only album on Bandcamp called Journey Bonus Bundle, which had different variations of themes

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.080
from Journey and Flow. And then a full soundtrack was released after that. There was a piano

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:34.560
arrangement called Transfiguration that came out after that, also on Bandcamp and as a physical

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:42.080
album. And then a two record vinyl version that was released in 2015. There was a Kickstarter for

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:51.200
a Journey live concert tour, and they will have people playing it and have the ensemble react in

01:17:51.200 --> 01:18:00.720
real time. It had a modified version of the game that they use with the music disabled.

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:09.920
It well surpassed its goal. Then on March 2022, so this year on the game's 10th anniversary,

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:15.040
Wintory released a rearranged version of Journey soundtrack with a full orchestra done by the

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:20.800
London Symphony Orchestra, the London Voice Choir, and cellist Tina Guo. It's called

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:27.120
Traveler, a Journey Symphony with reimagined elements and larger sets of instruments and

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:35.360
more vocalists. Basically it's bigger and better and more moving. But yeah, this game got so many

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:44.720
accolades. The Metacritic scores for both PS3 and PS4 were 92 of 100. Everywhere, there's not a

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:49.920
score on here that's less... Okay, there was one that gave it an eight out of 10. It was Edge,

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:54.000
but are they around anymore? I don't think so. I think they are actually, but it's all right.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:00.480
But Touch Arcade gave it a four and a half of five stars and everyone else was either

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:09.040
a nine of 10 or a 10 of 10. The only thing that really drew any criticism was the length and the

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:19.280
pacing. Not all players appreciated a deliberate melancholic pace as one critic said. That was

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:30.160
actually from the Edge review. They were basically saying it wasn't complicated enough. Well, that

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:36.720
person's entitled to their bad opinion. But they also said it could be compared to a concert or

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:43.120
well-directed film or a book you've been looking forward to. That it will create memories that last.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:53.520
All right, is that it? That's it. All right, classic game of the week. Journey, not to be

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:59.760
confused with a 1980s rock band that also had their own video game, but the classic that was

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:04.160
released on the PlayStation 3. And you know, just to, you know, obviously Jamie Scott had given us

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.440
the rundown of this game's history and so forth, but there's a couple quick things I want to say.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:12.000
Number one, I really believe this is one of the best video games they've ever made. Like I think

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.080
it goes beyond a classic game for me and that's my opinion. But I think this is truly one of the

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:24.800
best video games out there, period. And I know now that we're 10 years out, we talk a little more

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:32.080
openly about spoilers. But I think the fact that they hid that it was a multiplayer game

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:39.120
and you discovered that as you were playing it, but yet were not able to communicate in a

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:43.280
traditional method with the other player. I thought it was downright revolutionary at the time

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:52.800
and really just added to the art that this game was. And yes, as Bobby was pointing out in the

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:58.160
chat, Robin, I saw that concert. I don't know if this is like, maybe this thing they did at

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:03.680
MagFest, they're taken on the road or something like that. But I will say one of the best gaming

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:09.520
culture things I've ever seen was kind of what you were describing there, but they did that at

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:17.040
MagFest. God, I've lost all track of time. I want to say maybe that was 2017. I don't remember what

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:24.240
year. Bobby will probably remember better. But that was, yeah, that was when they actually

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:29.520
performed the whole game while somebody was playing it and Austin Montori was there conducting

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:36.640
it. And they were online and another player did join and was helpful. And that was all stuff you

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:43.040
can't really control. So that's so cool. Bobby does confirm the MagFest concert was the precursor

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.480
to the Kickstarter. Well, I'm not surprised because I'm sure a lot of people felt how we felt

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:53.200
about that concert, that it was just, it was outstanding and it deserved to be seen by more

01:21:53.200 --> 01:22:01.680
people. So yeah, just a little personal touch on the game there for me, but I truly believe this

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:06.240
is one of those, like, I don't necessarily have a list of like 50 games you must play before you

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.840
die. But like, if I did have a list, this would be on it for sure. I think this is one of the greatest

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:17.600
video games I've ever made. I really do. There it is. Classic game of the week. Journey. All right.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:23.760
Good pick. Good, good pick. All right. Let's make sure my co hosts are visible again. There we go.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:29.600
And then we can get back into some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other headlines.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:36.400
So Loki, we'll go to you. Well, since Rob already had mentioned it in his gaming week,

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:42.720
Nomad Sky has another update. So they've added Space Whales. And I didn't say anything about

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:47.440
the Space Whales because I haven't gotten there yet. I thought you did because you mentioned like

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:54.400
the whole organic thing. Well, shit, I ruin everything. So it's Nomad Sky Leviathan.

01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:03.280
They've got a whole new kind of roguelike mode that's in it as well. And yeah, the giant Space

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.040
Whales, which are hardly I mean, it looks more like a space squid than the Space Whale,

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:15.600
but whatever it does. Fish, free space fash. Although whales technically not fish, so

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.680
I said space cuttlefish.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:29.840
And then on Nintendo Switch Online, there are some updates coming in May. So we have on the

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:36.400
Super Nintendo Rival turf and Kongo's caper. And then pinball on the NES.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.840
Pinball on the NES was actually kind of rad for its time. I mean, you know,

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:45.120
I had it and it was all right. I played that when you can have pinbot

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:51.600
on NES. Well, I wish I wish they would put that on Switch Online and hard driving while they're

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:59.360
at it. But what and you know, pinbot was so good because, well, A, the soundtrack was great. Rare

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:03.600
always knocked it out of the park in that department. But B, it did stuff that pinball

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:09.680
tables don't do, which was controversial at the time. But like there were parts where like, like,

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.520
didn't aliens come out and would like eat the ball and stuff like that? Like it did. The game

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:18.240
did things that the table can't do because like, yeah, it it literally breaks the laws of gravity

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:23.600
and physics. But it's a video game. You're allowed to do that. So that's that's what I liked about

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:32.800
it. All right. Anyway, Darsakha, what do you have? Just some Stadia news. So on June 1, there's going

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:38.160
to be a launch of Through the Darkest of Times from Handy Games. It's a historical resistance

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:48.720
strategy game. And then there's also Mighty Switch Force Collection will also be coming out from Way

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:57.840
Forward. And it it looks actually like it's pretty fun. And then there is also Those Who Remain

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:06.160
by Wired Productions to be coming out. And I've actually seen some pretty nice games recently

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:12.320
coming out on Stadia, including like some really good freebies. But the Switch Force Collection

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:16.960
is the one I'm actually kind of happy about it. It's a very Gunstar Heroes sort of vibe.

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:26.800
Especially since hold on, there's one thing on here about the Oh, yeah. So you have characters

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:36.800
called Corporal. Hold on, Ugly Secret Baby is one of them is one of the character names.

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.880
All right. This is probably who I would play as.

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:47.520
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that are

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.480
coming to a store shelf or a digital shelf near you. Loki, we'll start with you.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:59.200
Yeah, not a whole lot of things. So we have a game called Silt coming out on PC,

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:05.680
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. We have Card Shark

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:14.480
on PC and Nintendo Switch. We have a game that shows you guys. No, I think this this is a

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:20.160
Devolver Digital title. It's Oh, it's not. It's an adventure. It's a little different.

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:26.640
Yeah, it's not the game show. I'm sorry. And of course, you know, you guys have to answer. Do you

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:32.480
do you guys not have phones? Because Diablo immortal is coming out. Oh, boy. And it's on

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:41.440
PC as well, in case you don't have a phone. And Android. And then loopers is going to be coming

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:47.840
out on Nintendo Switch and five memories of my time with you on a switch and PlayStation four.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:52.800
That's it. All right, going to Japan and looking at some of the releases over there on the Nintendo

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.440
Switch indigo seven is out in a regular and special edition. It is the English version of

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.000
the game but it is getting a localized release to Japan this week. Also the quintessential

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.960
quintuplets the movie five memories of my time with you also a regular and limited edition

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.960
coming out on the switch in Japan this week and then loopers is also out on the switch in Japan

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:19.360
on the PlayStation five indigo seven in the actually all of those games. Excuse me. No,

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:23.200
I was just accidentally looking at the same list. My bad. Let me try this again.

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.080
On the PlayStation five this week. Okay, well, that's why because nothing is out on the

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:35.760
PlayStation five this week in Japan. But on the PlayStation four, we have that same the quintessential

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.880
quintuplets the movie game is really the only release on PlayStation four. That's it a little

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:48.400
bit of a slower week in Japan. Dark Sakura only four things on the list. They're all on the 31st.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:56.480
Snow runner for the big three zombie night terror on switch and the last two on PlayStation is

01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:03.680
Autobahn police simulator three and in some in some this enhanced edition. All right.

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:10.720
Just a few more stories for you and then we'll invite your calls via discord at almost a twitch

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.960
that's where you watch twitch.tv slash vog network. But to participate further,

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:17.920
you can join our discord and you can also talk with us throughout the week.

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:21.760
Some folks share stories in our chat and that's great. I always love to see the discussion that

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:28.000
happens on that during the week. vog network.com that's vog network.com slash discord to join our

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.120
server there. We'll get to some of the roundtable talk here in a minute. But first we have a few

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:39.760
more headlines starting off with Loki. Yes, so there is a brand new game that's been announced by

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:47.040
the game grumps. And of course, you may remember them for their YouTube channel as well as dream

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:52.800
daddy, you know, who could forget that wonderful dating sim game. But now they're going to be doing

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:59.440
never watch their YouTube but watched a lot of people play dream daddy. That's true recently.

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:06.000
Yeah, recently. But you know, this one is going to be a little bit different. So it is a slasher

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:14.000
inspired game from with a kind of a unique looking visual style. It kind of reminds me a lot of like,

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:20.560
not, it's not quite PlayStation, but it's like early 90s. Like remind me like a loan in the

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:26.560
dark, but with just better graphics, I guess. I'm kind of creepy looking. They said it's supposed

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:35.280
to be a narrative driven psychological horror game. And it is, you know, full of puzzles,

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:40.400
dialogue choices, and of course, evading the killer. And apparently no two game or no two

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:46.080
playthroughs are going to be the same. The AI looks looks pretty cool. It's supposed to be

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:52.960
coming to steam and the Epic Games store and consoles later this year. Interesting. Well,

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:57.600
you know, dream daddy was quite the cult hit. And this seems to have all the makings of what,

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:03.520
you know, is popular on Twitch. So I'll be very, very curious to see how it goes. Mike Defton

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:08.880
chat says Yeah, it's like PlayStation one graphics and horror. SSJ 100. Matt says the Game Grumps

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:14.640
folks have been polarizing in the past. Not sure how it is now. I just it's I just don't follow a

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.600
lot of the YouTube stuff. But I know there's probably a lot more people watching that the

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:25.760
watching this. So it's fine. All good. Dark soccer, what do you have for us?

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:36.080
There is a game that was unveiled in 2020. That was by the creator of Dead Space,

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:44.640
Glenn Schofield is called the Callisto protocol. And it was very dead spacey, very scary. And then

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:52.720
they announced also though that the game would be set in the PUBG universe, which kind of surprising

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:59.680
for that. I mean, it's a horror game, a third person horror game set in 2320. And you are like

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:09.360
in this prison colony on Jupiter's moon Callisto. And the connection was that the developer striking

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:19.600
distance is explicitly established by PUBG Battlegrounds publisher to create narrative

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:25.760
driven games. So they thought it would be a good involvement in there. So when they went in,

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:31.040
they had like this lore team and writing the story and then going into it. And then but they

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:35.120
said that the horror game would have been pretty far out along the timeline. And then eventually,

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:40.960
they just dropped it all together. So it grew into its own world and is no longer associated

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:46.400
with the PUBG universe. All right. So long, farewell.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:51.680
I honestly didn't know PUBG had a universe. I didn't either, to be honest. So

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:56.960
everything has a universe. Yeah, that's true. That's true. All right. Yeah. Well,

01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:01.200
a lot of people have custom universes in this next game, right? Loki?

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:09.520
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if we go completely universal so long. But yeah, I know a lot of

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:17.840
people can get pretty involved with The Sims. So The Sims 4 has added a custom pronouns update,

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:22.320
I guess. I'm not really sure if it's an update or if it's just like an add on they have it.

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:28.800
But anyways, now when you create a sim, you can also completely customize, you know,

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:35.120
the different pronouns that they use in the game. So pretty awesome. Now that it's opened up a lot

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:45.840
of the the representation as well in there. I think that's great. That's great. Just in

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:53.760
time for Pride Month, which is actually great. So yeah, it's also just neat to hear about Sims 4,

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:57.360
because that games, that game could practically be a classic game of the week. I feel like it's

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:01.760
been out a while, you know, they were, you know, they're obviously the original Sims goes back to

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:06.080
what like 99 or something like that. And then, you know, Sims two and three didn't take a long,

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:09.600
long time after that. But then I feel like Sims 4 has kind of been where the series been out for

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:13.600
a long time. Maybe just because it's been so expensive. I'm just surprised we're not talking

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:18.240
about a Sims 5 yet in a while. Yeah, it's been a while. I don't know when the original came out.

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:23.280
But but there's been like, like 20 expansions for The Sims 4. Hasn't there? I know dark soccer knows

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:27.360
more about the series than I do. Let's put it this way. It's like it's about almost eight years old

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:33.200
now. I don't think I've touched the game in three years. Wow. Okay, yyr says September 2, 2014 was

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:38.080
the release date. So it is. It's not classic game of the week old, but it's getting there.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.640
It's getting there. Almost there. It's almost it's almost like pulling a grind that's out of five at

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:46.800
this point. Except they haven't released it a million times. No, that's true. That's true.

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:52.160
All right. Well, one more story on the show for you tonight. And this has to do with another

01:33:52.160 --> 01:34:01.120
classic recently unveiled. And that is Marble Madness 2, Marble Man, finally available to be

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:07.200
played in an emulator. Now, these machines did exist and you would see them once in a great

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:11.360
while. I know California extreme would get it once in a while. I think dark soccer, you probably

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:17.760
played it there probably talked about it on the show. But this is notable because the collectors

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:23.760
that had these machines and this machine, I don't think it ever really came out beyond a prototype

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:28.960
like it was a fully realized prototype, because they tested it, but it didn't do well with the

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:34.960
test groups. I think Atari was blaming trackballs were the problem. They wanted to do joysticks and

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:39.840
all that stuff, which is I don't know, it's kind of silly, but they didn't really release this game

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:46.480
wide. So collectors had this game, and they didn't want the value of the game to be devalued. So

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:51.280
nobody was putting it on the internet. Well, guess what happened this last week, it finally

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:57.120
made somebody broke the code, and it made its way to the internet. And you know what, I'm sure the

01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.840
collectors will be fine. I what Bobby was getting into this on his show a little bit when this

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:07.600
happened to another game several years ago, the collectors, they don't lose any value. But yeah,

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:13.520
ROM image of Marble Madness 2 started showing up on the internet archive and some other websites.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:20.080
And now it is actually playable in MAME. Some folks wonder and it was it was leaked by the

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:30.080
handle dank 2079, which go off dank. But I guess the ROMs have 20 year old timestamps on them.

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:34.720
So people are wondering, is this just old stuff that leaked? But then folks are saying, well,

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:42.480
it might be the the ROM readers could be using really old PCs, where Windows 95 is still the

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:50.160
operating system. And that's why it's showing as such an old thing. So as Joe had a mat wondering

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:55.360
if Mark Cerny, who is now with Sony worked on this, or if this is an Atari deal, Mark Cerny

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:59.440
did not work on the sequel, but he was he is very well known for having worked on the original

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:04.640
Marble Madness. So anyway, long story short, you can finally experience Marble Madness 2 after all

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:10.240
this time from MAME, which is interesting because we were just talking about romp or you know,

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:14.720
gaming history preservation earlier in the show. And now the you know, this is a way where many

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:19.520
people can really experience this for the first time. But there's another gag about this a lot of

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:26.160
people kind of saying, you know what, it's not a very good game. Like a lot of the magic that made

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:32.800
the original special. It's kind of lost in this. For example, from the Internet Archive, Jason

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:38.880
Scott said, Marbles Madness 2 is a classic example of when a beautiful game is created, and the sequel

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:44.720
completely forgets why the original is great. I'm excited. This long anticipated game is out in the

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:52.880
wild, because people can realize how uninteresting the game is and move on. Ouch, it is shady. That

01:36:52.880 --> 01:37:01.120
is very shit. Where's my RuPaul shade button? But anyway, it's still still though, it's a game of

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:06.480
historical importance for sure. And you know what now you can play it and see for yourself. So

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:13.120
Marble Madness 2. I can't tell you where to get it because technically downloading ROMs is piracy.

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:17.680
But I can just tell you once on the internet, always on the internet.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.480
Always on the internet.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:25.680
This is a game a lot of people are talking about. Yeah, right. And YYR is saying, you know,

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:30.160
as we're talking about being shady, and it's not very good. YYR is suggesting, maybe that's why

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:37.520
it was never released. It's a good thought, YYR could be. I don't know, though, there were a lot

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:44.400
of companies that were releasing shitty games like that doesn't always stop them. But fair point.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.480
Maybe they didn't want to tarnish the Marble Madness brand. I don't know. Although has there

01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:57.200
ever been a Marble Madness game since? Nope. There should be. That's, you know what, if Atari wants

01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:02.640
us to pay attention to their fucking VCS thing, that that computer that PC computer, why don't

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:08.000
you put a new Marble Madness game on it for starts? That would be pretty cool. Anyway.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:14.640
SJ100Matt says Bob Flanagan did lead the development for Marble Madness 2, who worked on

01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:20.560
the original with Mark Cerny, and coincidentally also worked on the Sims games in recent years. So

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:26.080
we love a callback and how things come full circle. All right, we're gonna go to the list

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:33.040
or roundtable where we open up our mailbag. Participate at orangesonsrated.com, as well as

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:39.920
any questions you might have in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash a vog network. And any calls you

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:45.120
might have over at vog at network.com slash discord. I don't think I saw emails this week,

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:51.120
but I'll check in with DarkSakra. Was that a no? One. Oh, there is one. Okay. No, not a one. Not

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.280
a one. Oh, I'm sorry. Your audio for some reason, like the very beginning is dropping. I don't know

01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:00.240
why. So because I have to my I had to move my mic to a different place. My mic arm fell off your

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.680
noise gate. Okay, got it. Got it. Um, noise gate. I'm not using a noise gate. Oh, interesting.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.480
My mic arm fell off and I had to put my mic back together. Okay. It's tis but a scratch, though.

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:17.360
Ah, well, arms off. We hope you'll send us an email in a future week participate at

01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:21.920
orangesonsrated.com. Usually if you don't send this email, that is the chance for DarkSakra

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:25.520
and I to talk about drag race. I don't know if you've checked out the latest season yet,

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:30.400
but another episode came out. And I got this season. I don't always watch drag race anymore.

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:36.320
I don't watch every season. This latest season. Very good. This latest episode. Not as good as

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:40.400
the second episode, but still pretty good. Some really good looks. And it was a ball.

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:45.680
It was a ball episode. And if I can spoil just a little something that's super cool DarkSakra.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:54.000
It was a it was in part a Vanna White inspired ball. And Vanna White was there. And she actually

01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:00.000
read all of but she didn't judge. She just was there on the main stage as you say, up next,

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.560
Raja with a look or whatever. But they didn't tell the queens that Vanna was going to be there.

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:09.840
So when they come out and start walking down the runway, you see them look over and then they go,

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:16.160
like, they suddenly recognize her and they freak out. So it's cute. It's worth a watch.

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:22.800
Anyway, Stan jinx monsoon end of tweet. But honestly, you could stand anybody in this

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.440
season. They're all they're all winners for a reason. Like anybody is good in this in this

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:33.040
season. Like I just I want them all to win. Can we break up the crown? Can we? That's what I'd

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:38.400
like to do. All right. Well, before we get to some last minute stories, maybe we do have a call in

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.040
the green room. So I'd like to go ahead and get to it. Let's get to it. Hello, you are on Orange

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:52.000
Lounge radio. Who's this? This is why we are Hi, why we are How are you? Oh, not so bad. Not so

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:58.720
bad for a Sunday night. Got a holiday tomorrow. I don't have to get up early and get the get the

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:05.280
toddler ready for daycare and rush to get out the door. And you know, get her dressed have her

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:10.400
reject her clothing. No, I have to pick something else. No, I don't want that one. I don't want that

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:17.040
one either. wind up getting 10 minutes late to work. But since I'm the only one in the office,

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:24.160
nobody notices Thank goodness. But I can't believe your kid is at that a I mean, like,

01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:31.040
of course, but it's just like, this pandemic has just my sense of time is so screwed. And like,

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.120
I'm like, Wait, don't you still have a baby?

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.320
Baby is gonna be for next month.

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:47.040
Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Right. It's only a year younger than my dear friend melody and Mel B. If you go

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:52.400
back in the DDR days, Mel B was very well known for freestyle stuff. Their child is only about a

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:59.600
year older. So it's it's wild that and I always I'm like, isn't isn't see still a baby? Like,

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:07.120
what happened? Anyway, sorry. Oh, my camera wasn't on. Sorry about that. I didn't want to mess up

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:11.360
your Oh, that's okay. You know, it's fine video there. I have to do different shots depending on

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:15.360
how many people are on the stream anyway. So it's and then sometimes it doesn't always go to the

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:20.720
right spot. So I have to make adjustments on the fly. Like what can you do? So anyway, hi, it's

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:27.520
good to see why we are what what to what do we owe a phone call tonight? Well, normally when I

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:32.880
call in, I call in because you know, I want to comment on something on a previous week or you

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:38.880
know, I want to shamelessly plug what I'm working on or you know, what have you. But this time,

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:49.680
it's different. Okay. This time, I am calling in to throw down. All right. You see? Oh, don't worry.

01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:54.320
You're not the target. Okay, good. Oh,

01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.360
what in the heck am I looking at behind you? Loki? Geez. All right. Anyway,

01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:06.880
I'm not even sure I want to know I missed the first hour. Sorry.

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:14.400
It's fine. But anyway, so I was catching up on recent episodes of olr this week.

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:19.840
And I listened to the not last week's episode, but the one before that,

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:24.880
just a few days ago, I listened to the end of it. And somebody called into the show.

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:38.880
And somebody who shall remain Ranma and mentioned that a Dave and Buster's opened in his

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:45.360
locality. And all Rama's ass out tonight. I know he's at a convention. It's Memorial Day weekend.

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:53.280
He ain't here live to defend himself and he'd be long his ass out. Fight him. Get her get her

01:43:53.280 --> 01:44:02.480
classic game stuff ready. Well, but anyway, he went ahead and mentioned that he, you know,

01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:09.920
played a set after a very, very long hiatus. And that it didn't go quite as well as maybe he would

01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:16.800
have hoped. And he suggested that perhaps there should be a new version of DDR for the over 40

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:23.760
crowd. That was made, you know, easier. To which I say you're about to rub it in that you did.

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:32.240
You're about to rub it in that you did max 300. Like a million. How many times was a million

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:39.200
times on your birthday? Well, something 42. But only half of those are on expert.

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:46.960
Which is the answer to life, the universe and everything. Yes, yes. But also my age. So as a

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:54.080
member of the over 40 club, who is currently working through the level 17 folder, I would

01:44:54.080 --> 01:45:03.200
like to say I'm giving you a challenge. And by the way, anybody else who is in the over 40 crowd,

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:09.760
yourselves included, please feel free to sign on to this because I endorse that completely.

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:18.960
You have a Dave and Busters near you now. Get your butt out there. Get practice can't make me

01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:28.000
get good. Right. And what I'm challenging you to do is by the end of this year,

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:37.120
play the following three songs all in one set. First stage, hyper twist, single expert,

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:44.080
absolute banger, one of my favorite songs in all of DDR forever. I'm sorry,

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:48.640
did you say absolute? I can do that one. Let's do absolute. No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:57.600
DDR joke people. I'm not gonna totally forget our old our old days. But yes, hyper twist is

01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:04.080
rated a 15. And it isn't. It's not the hardest 15. It is it is it flows very well. It doesn't

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:11.600
have too much confusing stuff. It is awesome. Second stage. Romancing layer, single expert

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:18.160
rated a 14. And it used to be a 15. They actually re rated it down to a 14 because it's not that

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:28.640
hard. Very nice uplifting song by tag. Great. Final stage max 300 single expert 15. The big

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:36.560
bad max 300. You can do it. I couldn't do max 300 when I was 24. When the show started. What makes

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:44.800
you think I can do it now? Well, actually, well, you answer. First of all, the song is

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:51.680
20 years old at this point. You've heard it a million times probably, even though you're not

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:59.040
playing it, you're familiar enough with it, that you could practically drum it out already without

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:07.440
even touching the pad. And it's just a matter of muscle memory, practice, and you just have to get

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:14.560
into the right shape before it I will say it was not that that long ago that I did Orion seven,

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:20.400
eight civilization mix because you know, that was one of the first songs in a DDR game and I'm

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:25.680
getting I'm sorry, sorry to the non DDR followers on getting deep cuts. All right. But Orion seven,

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:31.280
eight civ mix was one of the first songs that had like a unique step chart where you had to

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:35.200
hear like you'd put it in tutorial mode where it claps with the notes and you would hear that

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:45.680
clapping in your head. Right. And then like that. Yeah. Yeah. Like you just like I still remember

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:53.200
to this day. What's that? Yeah. What a pain in the butt chart that was too. Yeah. So So just just to

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:59.840
give some context here for those that are watching on Twitch, this this is the note chart that Oh,

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:04.400
wow, that even the new DR still uses the old videos. That's great. This is the note chart that

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:11.760
why we are suggesting actually step mania, by the way. Oh, is it? Yeah. They use like a DDR skin.

01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:19.200
We're all very familiar with this guy's videos. He's basically there on day two with, you know,

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:28.640
a YouTube chart of the video very reliable. But yes, it's a was once the hardest song in DDR,

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:35.360
not for very long, but it's still considered to be kind of a rite of passage to clear max 300 single

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:42.640
expert. That being said, they're, you know, teenagers or young adults who pick up the game now

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:50.800
and granted, it's a different time. The skill ceiling is so much higher now. Yeah, the

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:58.960
difficulty of the game is much higher now as far as how high it can go. And also, you know,

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:05.200
you can watch YouTube videos of expert players and learn their techniques and, you know, kind of

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:10.640
mimic what they do with their feet where, you know, we used to just stomp as hard as we could

01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:16.240
and now like, folks are really minimizing movements. They're trying to stay in the center

01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:21.280
and just kind of like, make subtle movements to hit everything and that way you don't use up all

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:26.800
your stamina very quickly. You can that's how you can get through these, you know, charts with 800

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:38.320
steps in them and still be standing afterwards. But but yeah, it's I've seen kids I'll call them

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:42.400
start playing this game now. And then six months later, they're already passing, you know,

01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:52.480
17s and 18s. So if they can do that, then we can get up to level 15 in the next seven months.

01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:56.560
Okay. But anyway, if Rama decides to take this challenge, which he should,

01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:02.800
I will if he if he's serious about it, and he gets to the point where he wants,

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:07.920
he can get there. And you know, over the I anticipate, we will probably be able to finally

01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:15.360
vaccinate any the summer. I will go to Dave and busters that day with him that he wants to

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:21.600
attempt it and I will play on the other side. Okay, so and I will join via facetime.

01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:28.320
I can't promise I can come out there in person. But maybe someday I can come see it in person.

01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:31.120
I'll stay in my pajamas and not move.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:37.120
Now, and if he succeeds, I will I will top up his his Dave and busters card with

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:41.520
probably a good at least 20 bucks of credits there.

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:45.600
All right. I love that. Now, I was gonna say this why we are because I said I said,

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.560
I'm not sure I could I could do that anymore. But um, you know, and I've mentioned this on

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:54.960
social media, and I'm not trying to toot my own horn too much. However, I'm gonna toot it a little

01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:00.160
bit. Oh, toot it. I absolutely toot it. I hit a pretty major landmark this week, I've lost 50

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:05.360
pounds since last year. So you know, that's awesome. And you know, I've talked about,

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:11.200
I was motivated by a diagnosis I didn't want, but it is what it is. And if it's going to have this

01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:16.400
side effect, then I'll take it. And so at my highest, you know, which was July of last year,

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:23.200
I'm now down 50 pounds from that. And games have been a reason I can thank for that. Specifically,

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:27.120
you guys all know, I can't really say DDR, because I don't really live down the street

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:30.080
from a Dave and Buster's or anything like that. I don't go with the frequency I used to.

01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:37.520
But I can say things like Pikmin Niantic, which really incentivizes walking,

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:43.040
Ingress, where I'm willing to walk an extra mile to go get a portal in the middle of nowhere,

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:48.000
just because it gets me moving and walking and all that stuff. Pokemon Go, sure, doing laps

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:53.680
around the Capitol, whatever, all of that, I absolutely say, yes, that's been a part of what's

01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:57.520
helped me get through this and do this. So it's interesting how things have come full circle,

01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:02.720
because I would say, you know, 20 years ago, when the show started, DDR was what was keeping me,

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:07.120
you know, relatively skinny. So it was I don't know if I call myself skinny, but you know,

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:13.520
anyway, it doesn't matter. So my point is, we're still waiting on this round one over in

01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:19.520
Roseville to open up, which is supposed to be soon. I think I'm hearing June, but we've been

01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:24.000
hearing all sorts of months we it was supposed to open in 2020. But we all know what happened.

01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:32.000
So once that opens, Aaron, I will do this too. I'm not going to promise I could do your exact

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:37.760
setlist. But I'm going to do this. I'm going to at least get back to that nine footer I did before

01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:41.440
if sieve mix is still on those machines, which I don't see why wouldn't it is it's kind of

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:48.080
reason is, I'll do that. Yeah, I believe it is. And we'll we'll start with that. And if I feel

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:53.520
pretty good, maybe I'll try to I'll try to get up to max 300. And then maybe start to explore your

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:58.560
setlist a little bit there. But it's going to be you know, because yeah, you look at a lot of these

01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:05.600
youtubes you look at stuff and now it's it's other 24 year olds that were the age we were when we

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:10.000
started. And it's just like if I show up there and start busting out those moves, that's like

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.800
they're gonna be like, Who the fuck is this old man? And where did he learn to play this game?

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:26.240
And it's like, I was here first. I will say this, you know, at least at the location near me,

01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:33.200
you know, new people come up all the time. So and of all ages, I actually one of the last times I

01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:39.840
went before you know, this latest COVID wave started. There was a, you know, someone with

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:45.840
kids and mom, a mom and she got up on the other side with me, she wanted to try it out. So I took

01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:50.800
it through her first set. And I love doing this because you know, I just I just love introducing

01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:57.440
the game to new people. And she I usually you know, they do the tutorial and then she she

01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:01.920
picked it up really quick. So I think we went straight to a two and she passed it and then a

01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:07.520
three a four and I think we played a five on extra stage and she almost got through it all

01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:14.320
the way without four misses. So she did pretty phenomenal for first time on there. And yeah,

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:18.720
you know what I use? You know what I used to do while we are and I should do this. Okay,

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:23.280
this is what this is what I'll do. Because I used to do when I would go play DDR in a new city where

01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:28.640
people wouldn't know me. I would put in like I hadn't seen me before. I would put in the money

01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:34.960
and I would play like for my first song, I'd play like an erotic song on the band. I would play

01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:38.400
because you know, I love them. I would play like I'm basic, like, you know, a two footer or three

01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:43.040
foot I play that and then I play and so people would be like, Oh, look at this guy playing.

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:50.960
And then for my last song, I bust out the hypnotic crisis, or the Orion seven, eight sieve mix,

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:54.880
or one of those like nine footers Afro Nova or something. I don't remember if that was a nine,

01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:58.320
but I would bust out with those like way harder songs and just then just

01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:04.240
blow through it and then just be like, and that was fun to do.

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.160
Wow, this game's really fun people.

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:16.640
Excellent. But yeah, if anyone is curious about this set, I'm actually going to stream because

01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:21.440
tomorrow's the last day of the month. And also I don't have to work. So I'm probably going to do

01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:28.240
a stream of DDR Grand Prix, probably around somewhere between one to 2pm Eastern, I'll start

01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:34.720
and I'm going to play this set during my stream tomorrow. So I'll probably stream for about an

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:42.320
hour. And yeah, I'll clip it and probably link it on the discord so that everybody can get a look at

01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:48.000
it. All right, please do. I love the challenge YYR. We'll see. We'll see what happens. Cross

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.400
your fingers that we get that stinking round one already because the the Dave and Buster's here not

01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:57.680
very good. It's, it's the smallest one in the entire chain with that, with the exception of

01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:05.280
Times Square is smaller. That's it. It's the Times Square one is not very big, but it's not supposed

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:09.440
to be. Yeah, of course, it's not going to be very big. They probably got to pay 10 times more in

01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:15.520
rent than all the other locations. So but round one will be a game changer when that opens. So

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:22.000
all right, it's great. And you know what I will mention. So the new version Ace three is starting

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:29.760
to roll out. Currently it's on the gold cabs. But the peasants with all the other cabs have to wait

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:36.960
until I'm guessing July because that's what they did with Ace two Oh, when it came out. So probably

01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:45.520
July and there's a lot of, you know, features of the game, things like extra stage, point two,

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:53.440
five and point seven, five speed mods, things that are locked out unless you play premium play,

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.080
which in Japan costs a little bit more and you have to pay with their funny money, Paselli.

01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:06.080
Yeah. And up to this point, you know, because round one, all the round one locations have one

01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:11.840
of these gold cabs running the Japanese version of DDR. But up until this point,

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:17.520
because it was a Japanese cab, you could not use the premium play mode because it required Paselli.

01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:25.520
Starting with Ace three, they're allowing Japanese version cabs that are outside of Japan,

01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:31.920
where Paselli is disabled to pay with premium play with coins. So for the first time ever,

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:41.840
uh, you can now actually get extra stage the unlocks. You can you can play the Dan courses,

01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:47.680
the skill courses, which get progressively more difficult. You can finally do those things in

01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:56.400
America. So on on a gold cab. So it'll be even better to have the round one when it does finally

01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:02.240
open. All right. Well, I can't wait for that day to come. Why are Thank you so much for calling

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:06.480
in. And again, I encourage everyone I know you didn't come to shill your wares tonight,

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:11.200
but I'm going to do it for you. I would encourage everyone to check out falling plus just came out

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:17.840
on Xbox one. So check that out. Over it. You got to search for why we are games are falling plus,

01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:22.880
or just you know, check out why we are games calm and all the latest stuff that you're working on

01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:27.600
and all that good stuff. So yeah, support your support your neighborhood indie developer.

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:34.400
Thank you. All right. I look forward to Rama calling in next week to whine about this.

01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:37.680
Sounds good. Let him let him be here to hear that.

01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:45.600
All right. Take care. Now. Great to have you. All right. Bye. Have a great week. You too. Bye.

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:51.760
All right. Always good to hear from why we are here at orange launch radio. Let's check in with

01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:56.080
Loki to see if there's any last minute stories tonight. Nope, there is nothing.

01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:59.200
Wow, you're boring. I'm just kidding. I know. It's a slow news.

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:04.160
With Memorial Day and everything. It's you know, it's it's moving into the summer. It's that time

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:08.240
of year. So it is what it is. But things are gonna start to pick up. You know, we got state of play

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:14.720
next week. So it's good. It's quite before the storm. Yeah. Quickly, I'll let sj 100. Matt have

01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:20.240
this question and then we'll wrap up sj 100. Matt says here's a question. Is there a gaming memory

01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:25.440
out there that reminds you of summer? For example, a game that you played the hell out of over the

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:33.600
summer when school was out? Is rocker on roller skates? What on roller skates? Frogger Frogger

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:39.840
arcade machine. Oh, well, roller skates. Okay. Summer's going to the Babalu roller roller rink

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:48.800
in Dothan, Alabama. And the thing is, is that Bob, it was named after Bob and his wife. And Bob was

01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:55.120
a friend of my granddaddy. So he saw always go and talk to Bob, and he'd give me like a dollar

01:59:55.120 --> 02:00:00.800
in quarters. And I would play a few rounds of Frogger on roller skates into this day.

02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:04.720
The only play I can really the only way I can really play Frogger well is on roller skates.

02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:11.920
Um, I remember it roller king out in Roseville, where I grew up, I played Spy Hunter in roller

02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:20.400
skates. But uh, but yeah, um, I don't, I don't know if that's not really a summer memory in

02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:24.640
particular. I'm trying to think of a summer memory and I'm coming up short. I gotta be honest,

02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:28.240
I can't think of anything I really like super associate with summer. I'm sure there are plenty

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:32.160
of video games when I was younger. But I would play video games every day. I wouldn't let the

02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:38.480
school week stop me. I don't know. Loki, you have a summer memory? In recent and will not

02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:46.880
not recent. I don't know, DDR, I guess. I don't really have anything that kinda I mean,

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.920
no, I didn't really have anything in particular that it would always change to me. It's whatever

02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:58.240
games were out at the time, you know, go rent stuff at blockbuster or something like that.

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:05.040
Yeah, don't really have anything. All of mine just have to do with being in Dothan. So a lot

02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:13.840
of SkyShark and uh, uh, Dr. Mario. I got one for an answer. Cause you know,

02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:19.680
when I was very, very young, I played a lot of Commodore 64 and one game that I used to love

02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:24.800
to play was summer games too. So they couldn't call it Olympics cause they didn't have that

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:28.560
license, but wink, wink, nudge, nudge. It was just an Olympic game and had all the same things.

02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:33.360
And there was a summer games one, but we had summer games too. I think we got the summer

02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:37.520
games one eventually, but summer games two was the one that I played a lot. And then there was

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:42.160
winter games, but that's not a summer game. So, um, yeah, I used to play the hell out of all

02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:49.200
those games. So like epics and that actually led to, cause those games series led to world games

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:53.360
and California games. And I think people might know those because some of the, one of the

02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:58.000
California games, I think it was on NES, um, as well as some other platforms. So that's like

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:05.040
summer and winter games with the predecessors to those games. So all right. Well, uh, with that,

02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:07.920
we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up for the night.

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:11.440
But I do want to say thank you as always for listening to orange orange radio,

02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:15.200
whether you were here tonight on a three day holiday weekend, uh, or if you were listening

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:19.840
on the podcast feed through one of your favorite podcast apps like Spotify, iTunes, wherever it is,

02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:24.160
you listen to podcasts. Thank you for checking us out. Uh, if you enjoyed what you heard, tell

02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:27.360
a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer

02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:32.400
has a voice, but we need more voices here to put out on air. Uh, we're hitting 20 years old,

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:37.040
if you can believe it or not later, uh, next month. And, uh, we hope to see you here, um,

02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:43.360
June 26th. Um, get off my lawn and give me some Jerry. That's right. That's right. Uh,

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:47.920
let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Uh, dark Sakura, what is your final thought

02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:52.720
tonight? I'm actually kind of glad to be starting early cause then I can end early.

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:58.960
Mm hmm. Cause my ass is working tomorrow, but let's hear it for, for double and a half pay,

02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:05.760
right? Hell yeah. For holiday pay. All right. Have a good night. Dark saga later taters later.

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:10.640
And a Loki, your final thought. I have a lot to do and not a lot of time to do it in

02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:14.480
isn't that always the struggle. It is always the struggle.

02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:22.240
Um, my final thought I'm very thankful for a day off tomorrow. Um, and I, I of course recall the

02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:26.720
reasons for it. So, uh, I, I am mindful of that as well, but I'm thankful to just have a day of

02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:32.560
rest, uh, tomorrow. Um, I actually, I don't really have a plan, which is kind of nice. I

02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:37.120
didn't really want to travel. Um, I just kind of wanted to relax, especially after hosting a show

02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:41.120
last night. I know whenever I do that, I'm putting myself a little more at risk for COVID. So I just

02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:46.720
take it easy for a few days to make sure I'm doing okay. So, uh, yeah. So, um, I'm thankful for day

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:51.760
off and I am very thankful for the show. Hosting stuff has been going very well. We had a really

02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:57.040
awesome show last night. It was a pride based cabaret. Um, and I always love when I get to

02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:02.240
host celebrities like, uh, you know, I did John Waters a few months ago, but this week we had Sam

02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:08.720
well, who is best known for his YouTube classic. What, what in the butt was performing at the show.

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:14.880
And I love hosting celebrities like that because they know exactly they, they, they don't think

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.720
they're anything bigger than what they are. You know what I mean? He's a very humble guy

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:22.000
and just there to have fun. And that's what I love about it. That's what it should be.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.960
Does he have any other songs? He does. He did a whole little mini concert of like, um,

02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:30.800
five songs or something like that. So, uh, but they're, they're all like,

02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:35.520
Loki. I don't know if they're all like gays, they're all gay sex songs. I don't think you'd

02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:40.960
necessarily be into them, but I will actually shocked. Our crowd was super into it. So what

02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:45.440
was it like dirty, filthy boy or something like that as his latest single? Sorry, Sam. Well,

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:48.560
I butchered the name. I just couldn't remember in the moment, but yeah, so,

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:53.200
but they're, they're all, it could be in DDR. It's all like, that's, you know what? You cannot,

02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:58.880
you cannot sit here and be like, I loved all those DDR songs back in the day and then think like,

02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:03.040
Oh, but I'm too good for Sam. Well, no, no, no. Exactly.

02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:07.280
Come on. We used to have, was it the alligator project songs in there?

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:12.320
Oh yeah. Blow my whistle, bitch. Come on. Come on. Is that, is that really any,

02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:18.240
any better lyrically than what, what in the butt? Come on. All right. Anyway,

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:24.880
on that lovely note, happy Memorial day. We'll see you in seven days to do it all again.

02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:27.280
