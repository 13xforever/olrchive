1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,240
I know I heard about the 24-karat gold-plated Wii made for the Queen of England, but today

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,760
I learned that she wasn't allowed to receive it. It's a highly coveted console due literally

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,600
to its precious metal, slightly limited playability since Wii's online services have been shut

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,040
down, but was otherwise a relic of a successful machine with an ecosystem that is still rich.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,000
Like you would have to be to win the auction for it. Jeez!

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,720
This is another sliver of THQ history. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,080
Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,160
Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:44,760
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,760
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,880
number 913 of our show for tonight, May the 8th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and joining

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,640
me as he always does say hello to Techmaster Loki.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Hello.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,560
Hey, Loki, how are you?

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
I'm doing good.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,680
Good. What's new with you?

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,520
Not much other than, you know, just Minecraft stuff.

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,360
Do we have a new video to look forward to?

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,440
Yeah. And having having bad luck with trying to find things to do today because I was trying

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,800
to go roller skate or rollerblading again. And like two of the rinks were closed. One

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,920
was closed due to some speed skating competition. One just changes their their hours. They're

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,280
like, OK, let's go have pizza at this one place. That place was closed because I guess

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,960
they were short staffed. They were like, OK, let's go play mini golf. Then it started hailing.

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,840
I was like, OK, I'm going home.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,440
Oh, yeah. The weather was very strange today. It was very like, I'm going to be sunny. No,

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,560
I'm going to rain. No, I'm good because I was out walking and that was an adventure.

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,160
Let me tell you. So I'm also joining us tonight. Say hello to Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,560
Hi.

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,360
Hi. I wasn't sure if you were going to be here or not. I thought you were going to sit out,

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,880
but that's all right. I'm glad to have you.

31
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,320
I was going to, but I figured I'll try. You know, headaches are weird. The moment that

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,680
I took off my headset, like it was instant feeling better. So.

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,720
I'll push through it. I'm medicated. I have drugs in my body.

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,760
Hooray. Always, always nice to have. Well, it's good to have the gang all together. I'm

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,000
glad you're here. But if the migraine headache thing becomes too much, just let us know and

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,840
we'll continue on the show. We'll continue. I'll be here for for at least the first story.

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,520
I just want to, you know, hang out and be with everybody for a little bit. Just, you know,

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,040
I missed last week and I don't want to miss too much of this week. I'd rather, you know,

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,400
at least, at least spend some time with everybody before I throw in the towel.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,280
Makes sense. Well, great to see you. Sorry to hear you're not feeling well, but

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,120
your makeup is great. I know you, I know you need to, if you're going to take the time to

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,720
do your makeup, you got to go. You got to show up. I'll tell you what, my makeup is pretty half

43
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,360
fast. I did it in five minutes. All right. And honestly, I'm actually still

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,720
wearing my pajamas. I just put on a bra. Well, do you see what you're missing? Not

45
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,160
being here live because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,520

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:39,440
twitch.tv slash vog network. And yeah, you can follow us along as we tape live on Sunday nights

48
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,720

51
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,160
dark Sakura, a DJ Rama S in response to you talking about your dressing habits.

52
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:07,280
Say this is why we stand Jamie go queen. And I'll be perfectly honest. This is also my work

53
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,880
attire when I'm not in the office. Yeah. I think honestly it's, if I don't have to be on zoom,

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,880
I'm probably not even wearing a shirt. I've attended many an online training with my big

55
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,560
fuzzy bathrobe and no one bats an eye because we're all doing it.

56
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,160
As she went under, Matt says, you do you Jamie feel better. Absolutely.

57
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,200
I appreciate that. And that's my intention. I just wanted to be on for a little bit, you know,

58
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,120
say hi to everybody before I do a bow out. So, right.

59
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Well, let's get to our kickoff story tonight. It's a big one. In fact, actually this news happened

60
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,400
like right after OLR last week. It was interesting cause it was kind of the middle of the night when

61
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,960
this news broke. But it actually was prime time in Europe. So it was Monday morning in Europe.

62
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,840
So we heard about this at what, like 11 o'clock at night because that's when the workday was

63
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,520
starting over in Europe. Loki, you don't want to get into this big, big acquisition in the

64
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,160
gaming industry, right? Yeah. So the Embracer group is purchasing Crystal Dynamics,

65
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,920
Eidos Montreal and Square Enix Montreal for 300 million, which is actually pretty

66
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,600
cheap considering some of the acquisitions we've had recently. That includes of course several,

67
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,840
you know, big IPs, of course, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, Legacy of Kain and of course

68
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,440
a back catalog of about 50 games. It also takes Avengers with it too, doesn't it?

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Sort of. Technically the game is sort of there, but the license is really, and Disney licensed

70
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,040
that to Square Enix. So technically, no, they would have to get permission from Disney to move

71
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,400
that license. They'd have to buy the source code. There's kind of question if it's worth it,

72
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,520
I hate to say, because of the Avengers game not really performing at the level they were hoping.

73
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,200
It's a good game though. Yeah. You know, especially I hear it's in a pretty decent

74
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,040
place at this point from where it was at launch, but it's just one of those things where for

75
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,200
whatever reason, yeah, it just, it didn't get us. Did they also do Guardians of the Galaxy or was

76
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,640
that a different group? No, that was. It wasn't Crystal Deep. It was Eidos.

77
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,080
Yeah. So yeah, they technically get that game, but again, the IP intellectual property is still

78
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,520
Disney's to dole out. I'm more referring to the code. Yeah. So, well, the code for the game,

79
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,080
I guess technically would go to Embracer, but they can't do anything with it besides the game

80
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,960
that's already out unless they go to Disney and renegotiate that basically. Yeah. I'm sure they've

81
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,760
got stuff worked in their contracts and everything, but yeah, Guardians was a great game. I didn't get

82
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,840
to play it cause it won't run through steam on my Mac, but I've watched the entire thing.

83
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,280
Yeah. Guardians seemed to be much better received than Avengers, at least at launch. Cause I think

84
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,120
what's interesting is that the bar was very high for Avengers. It didn't meet that bar well for

85
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,240
many, I should say. And I have, I have no horse in this race. I am not huge on Marvel. Like a lot of

86
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,280
people, I don't hate it by any means. I just it's, it's there and I appreciate it and I, you know,

87
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,200
golf clap it, but I don't, I don't rabidly follow it or anything. I didn't see that new movie that

88
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:32,560
came out this weekend. I'm afraid to, but because yeah, I've I've it's see most Marvel movies and

89
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,840
they come out. I hear nothing but great things. This one, very polarizing, very polarizing.

90
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,120
The thing is, is that I've, people have just have compared it to drag me to hell, which I hate drag

91
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,840
me to hell with an unholy passion. I love Sam Raimi movies. I hated that one. That was like

92
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,080
one of the last movies I've walked out of just absolutely like, why the fuck did I waste my time?

93
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,160
I'm trying not to make these two movies fight, but I can't help it. I already saw the best

94
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,520
multiverse movie of the year. Cause I saw everything everywhere all at once.

95
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,120
So I want to see that. Well, and my, my other thing is that I'm tired of the trope of

96
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,360
woman in grief with lots of power goes crazy. So just a boring trope.

97
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,120
Um, but anyway, where were we? Oh yes. The bar for Avengers high for many people not met the

98
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,560
bar for guardians low, because when those trailers and things are coming out, people were like,

99
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,680
Oh, I don't know about this one, but exceeded expectations is very kind of interesting thing.

100
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
I think I would say that the bar for guardians was set pretty low. People did not have high

101
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,080
expectations for that game. Um, and I don't know if that's like the Chris Pratt drama

102
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,160
carrying over to the game, even though he has nothing to do with the game. Um, but yeah,

103
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,280
it's well, that and star Lord is by in the comics, which is awesome. Yeah. So anyway,

104
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,240
so my point is, yeah, the guardians thing is also worth money. I would think Tomb Raider alone

105
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,520
should have been worth a pretty penny. So embrace her absolutely got to steal. And if you don't

106
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,640
know who embrace her is, they're basically THQ Nordic. It's a little more nuanced than that,

107
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,920
but I'm just going to tell you the short version is their THQ Nordic.

108
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,240
And they've been buying a lot of stuff. I heard a great comparison on Bobby shows.

109
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,720
Of course we tape live after Bobby black Wolf does here at VOG network. He called it the 10 cent of

110
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,000
Europe. And I think that's a very apt comparison, especially in the last couple of years,

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,400
THQ Nordics been, you may not realize this cause you might think like THQ or that, well,

112
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,800
okay. Cause this company, they grabbed the THQ name. They they're grabbing this,

113
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,920
they grabbed a gearbox. They got, they've been grabbing a lot of companies when you haven't

114
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,160
been looking. And some of the IPS they have, I mean, they have the goat simulator,

115
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,320
they have time splitters, borderlands, Dark Siders is going to be there. Yeah.

116
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,880
So this is a pretty big holding now. And now, so this, this is the house that is now going to

117
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,880
Tomb Raider and all these other things, which is wild. I cannot believe Square Enix

118
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,880
sold it for as little as they did. Why did Square Enix hate Tomb Raider so much?

119
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,680
Like I, and, and, and the reason why I say that is it all goes back to, we all know that quote

120
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,120
that, you know, the president of Square Enix said that Tomb Raider had,

121
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,480
did not meet expectations, even though it sold like 6 million copies. And I'm sorry,

122
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,880
but the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy was fucking great. Like it was,

123
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,680
those were some good fucking games. And like, Lara Croft and the no good, very bad day.

124
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:40,400
Yes. Or I like Alan's name for it. Girl. You remember I made that picture a while back.

125
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,040
Yeah, no, that's, that's what my husband Alan calls it. He calls those games.

126
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,280
Girl. That's cause that's what it is. She, she hits a tree branch. Girl. She dodges lightning

127
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,360
bolts. Girl. That's what it is. She falls down a hole into a sewer. Girl. Yeah.

128
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,280
TigerClawn chat says Square Enix has unrealistic expectations.

129
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,360
Fifth Dream in chat says, notice it's all their Western games, but all the J stuff is still at

130
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,680
Square Enix. Yes. That is also interesting. If we want to talk about unrealistic expectations,

131
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,480
they think they're going to make money with NFTs. I mean, there's some unrealistic expectations.

132
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,040
And now there's that quote going around is that we, we had to sell these so that we could invest

133
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:32,640
in the blockchain, which I hope they lose everything. Gaming companies. I don't want

134
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,160
them to lose everything. I need my final fantasy series. My father has a 14, my father has a 16

135
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,360
Yoshi P. I need to put him in a bubble. He's a precious angel. I in for the gaming industry,

136
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,200
I need those people protected. I don't want Square Enix to fail. Absolutely not. So I, but I,

137
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,200
I need this NFT thing to them to back off this whole thing. Because again, I don't be,

138
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,680
and I was talking about this a little bit on Bobby's show. I'll say it again.

139
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,560
I view NFTs very similar to the Diablo three real money auction house. And I know that there are

140
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,200
going to be nerds out there that want to correct me saying, well, actually with the difference

141
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,120
between NFTs, would that be NFTs are not centralized and Blizzard ultimately owned

142
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,480
everything that was through the Diablo three auction house. Okay. Yes, I get it.

143
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,400
But here's the thing. A lot of people out there don't understand NFTs. And when they think of

144
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,040
NFTs right now, they see those ugly fucking monkeys that are like the bit, what are they,

145
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,080
what is that? The yacht, eight club or whatever those are. They are ugly. They are more to come

146
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,520
on that ugly fucking monkeys riddled with crime. That is what NFTs are right now.

147
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,960
So if you want this to break into the mainstream,

148
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,800
you've got to convince people what are the, you know, benefits to this.

149
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,680
And I understand that a lot of it, or why I understand that a lot of it to me feels like

150
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,560
amiibo. And yes, I understand amiibos are not unique in nature, but you can load unique things

151
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,160
to them and amiibo. And this is why I say Nintendo is going to be the one that pushes NFTs and gets

152
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,120
it right. Because amiibo, the reason why it works is well, A, the figures are nice, B,

153
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,280
they work in multiple games. And that's, you know, these things, you know, if you can buy content

154
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,160
that really truly works in multiple games, I think it's going to be great. But I think Nintendo is the

155
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,320
only company that's got it all in one roof where people are going to eat it up. I don't think

156
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,840
Square Enix, I mean, maybe with the Final Fantasy franchise, but I don't, God, I don't want them to

157
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:43,760
see him. It just doesn't make sense for the Final Fantasy franchise. So Bobby Blackwell, to be fair,

158
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,040
saying NFTs technically do not have to be unique. They are just intended to be philosophically.

159
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,920
Look, here's the thing. I, on one hand, I kind of get where the NFT technology is going. A

160
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,240
decentralized Diablo 3 auction house where let's say the swords you get can actually work in all

161
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,240
these other games, too. I kind of get that. I just don't see that realistically working in

162
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,000
our industry for a long time. And I think it's way too early to get into it when right now,

163
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,680
when people hear NFT, they think of fucking crime, they think of spammers, they think of crime,

164
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,080
they think of things to delete and send instantly to the trashcan, because that's what it is on the

165
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,960
internet right now. And if you're a crypto bro, I'm sorry, I'm telling it like it is.

166
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,720
That is what most people, maybe your bubble doesn't view it that way. But most people out

167
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,400
there don't get it. And I'm sorry, but those ugly fucking art pieces of art are not going to sell

168
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:49,920
it to them. So that's that's my weekly NFT rant. So anyway, so I don't understand why Square Enix

169
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,960
thinks that they've got to get in this right now. I really don't. S2100 Matt says to get on the

170
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,240
ground floor. S2100 Matt says many hardcore NFT folk understand that at some point the market

171
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,560
will drop out. And all of these monkey and other stuff will be worth noting. It's all about cashing

172
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,120
in now. Bobby Blackwell says Square Enix's president says you are in the majority opinion,

173
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,760
but you will change your mind soon. And Bobby, I'm willing to admit, I may change my mind.

174
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,400
And this has been shocking. But you know what's going to do it? It's not going to be a fucking

175
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,520
ugly ass random, randomly clothed monkey. It's not going to be that. You know what's going to

176
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,720
do it? Pokemon. That's when we're going to get into NFTs. And I know right now you don't want

177
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,120
to hear me say it. You don't want to hear me even open up that realm of possibility. But that's I'm

178
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,720
I I will bet money. Nintendo is the only one that's going to make it happen. And when they

179
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:53,040
make it happen, it happens. So that's that's my opinion. Bobby Blackwell says yes, the goal for

180
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,600
NFT people is for them not to be the last person holding the bag when the market crashes. That's

181
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,880
why they really, really want you to get into it so they can sell you their NFTs. Hence the crime,

182
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,600
the spam, and the no fucking thanks that goes along with all of that right now.

183
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:17,280
So anyhow, the thing is, is that they need to actually get the true pulse of

184
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,320
the people. You can't create, and I'm saying create and quote fingers, you can't create

185
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:34,160
something, put it out there. And if people don't want it, you can't force it on them. They're not

186
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:44,320
going to, to take something that's forced on them. I mean, and we know the the loudness of

187
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:52,560
our of our community, right? We know the forcefulness when people do not want, right?

188
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,240
And we've we've seen what internet campaigns can do. I mean, a lot of people like, oh, that

189
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,880
does jack shit. But in truth, major changes have happened because of it,

190
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,480
because of really upset people on the internet. And that's what they're, they're not remembering,

191
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,560
especially and I mean, a lot of the Japanese companies, the successful ones look outside

192
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:30,240
of Japan. They look at the world pulse on it. They look at where the trends are worldwide,

193
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:39,600
because and not not to be like, oh, America, blah, blah, blah, but really a lot of the world

194
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,320
changes. I mean, we are a big country with a lot of people. You know, that you have to do a

195
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:54,800
comparison between what's going on in Japan and America and Europe and find the commonalities.

196
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,160
And they're not doing that. They're saying, Oh, no, we think that this is going to be the

197
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,200
big thing. And we're going to make this happen. And it's not, it's not going to happen. They're

198
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,760
going to lose money on this one. And they're going to say, why the hell did we sell Tomb Raider?

199
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:18,800
In five years, 2027, Nintendo is going to launch Nintendo fun tickets. And with Nintendo fun

200
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,800
tickets, you can make a design, and you can sell it and it can be an Animal Crossing shirt. And

201
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,600
it's also going to be a design that's on your Pokeballs in your inventory. And it's also going

202
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,320
to be something that you can use in the background in Mario maker. And it's also something that sits

203
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,520
in your Smash Brothers trophy collection. And when Nintendo fun tickets happen,

204
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,760
that's when it'll finally happen. But don't I Nintendo is going to do it.

205
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,280
They'll be last to the party for sure. But I'm just

206
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,240
But Nintendo has always been very conservative.

207
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,080
Nice. Very true. Yes, yes. But that's why I said when they finally get to the party,

208
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,800
that's when it's, you know, happening. So but and I don't think Nintendo is going to

209
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,760
go to the party, I think Nintendo, as is their way, they're going to have a completely different

210
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,840
party, and it's going to have the success and everyone's going to go, why the hell did we not

211
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,920
do that? It's like, because Nintendo looks outside the box, and they do have their, you know, I like

212
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:27,920
to say that Nintendo has that ability to look around the corner. You know what I mean? To take

213
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:34,320
a true peek around the corners, where people are just looking in the straight line, they're

214
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,120
looking at the wall, they're looking at the path around the wall, you know, straight ahead of them.

215
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,720
But Nintendo is looking around to see, well, what's going to come in? I mean, we've always

216
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,960
thought them to be very conservative in their approach to technology. You know, they've all

217
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,840
like, while their systems haven't been the most powerful in comparison, they've had the most

218
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:07,040
fun, in my opinion, just in general, their games focus on fun, their peripherals focus on fun,

219
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:14,000
they focus on things that are enjoyable. And if they're not going to go the route of the NFT,

220
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:23,280
for for those same reasons that you know, it's it may not be the fun that consumers are looking for.

221
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,760
It's just money in the pocket. And we've even seen, they've been willing to take a hit financially,

222
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,400
to put out something that's going to be more fun. And in the end, it usually pays off for them. I'm

223
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,880
not counting the Wii U, you know, Reggie, and this is another reason why I'm saying even though yes,

224
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,200
I know Nintendo is conservative everything. This is one of the reasons I am well, there's two

225
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,960
reasons why I'm saying Nintendo with this because number one, I strongly believe Nintendo is the

226
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,720
only gaming company I can think of save for maybe Sony and Microsoft first party stuff. But I think

227
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,160
Nintendo is stronger than both of those even. Nintendo is the only company with a first party

228
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,320
ecosystem strong enough to support the vision we're being promised of NFTs. I don't think any

229
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,760
other company out there has the ecosystem of insular titles to support that system is not

230
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,520
Square Enix, not after just selling off three of their, you know, big properties, but I digress.

231
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,800
The other reason why I bring it up, Reggie's out there right now doing a big book promotional tour,

232
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,160
and he's doing a lot of interviews to support the book. I understand Reggie has not represented

233
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,160
Nintendo for several years now. However, he's been out there saying, Yeah, I think blockchain,

234
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,760
I think blockchain is the future of the industry. I think I think, you know, we're not there yet.

235
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,440
But I think that's something we're getting towards. Here's the thing. I really I know.

236
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,360
Yes, Reggie has nothing to do with Nintendo anymore. He's not speak for them. I get it.

237
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,760
But was he speaking about it a couple years ago? Was this something that intended because you know,

238
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,440
these these companies they're looking they're looking far forward. Was it something that

239
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,880
maybe they would, you know, he still has friends, he still has people he's talking to.

240
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:08,080
I'm not I just think Nintendo, they know about it, whether they're going to embrace it or not,

241
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:15,520
they certainly know about it. I think that they're going to have their own variant of the thing.

242
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:24,000
Yeah. Like I said, tickets now. Maybe not like that. But like, and I'll tell you,

243
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,440
I actually ordered a game on play Asia today and they take crypto.

244
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,660
Hmm.

245
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,960
Um, I think that the concept is going to evolve into something more stable.

246
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,920
Not this decentralized thing. But

247
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,320
it's it, I think it's going to be some sort of hybrid, something that can be tracked,

248
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:58,000
something that can be regulated, but still allow a level of anonymity and personal control.

249
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,040
You know, something like, you know, like in the movies, like in the future, oh,

250
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:09,680
we pay X credits for something right. You know, where it's not physical money anymore.

251
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,360
I think we're going to be down the line going to something like that, if that makes sense.

252
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,120
And I think that we'll have a lot more digital property down the line,

253
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,560
but I don't think it's going to be exactly the way that the NFT thing is going to be.

254
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,120
And I actually agree with fifth dream in here, decentralization, which is touted as

255
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
it's great feature is the whole reason people get getting ripped off.

256
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,080
Yes. I just looked at that comment too. I was like, yep, that's it.

257
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,120
If you never do it, I'll tell you why they won't ever do it. Because Nintendo can't stand when

258
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:57,120
their property decreases in value. And NFTs are going to decrease in value, they will never touch

259
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,800
it. No, they they I don't think that's the case because they know that their amiibo are going to

260
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,880
eventually decrease except for those ones that are like misprints or limited prints. Those might be a

261
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,840
different case. And I agree with Jamie in the sense that I don't think Nintendo would allow it

262
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,520
to be completely decentralized. I think it'll be the illusion of decentralized.

263
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,400
Yeah, I think there's going to be and well, and I also want to point out if you look at history,

264
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,280
right? You know, I'm going to go actually back to something I've brought up before

265
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:38,400
the whole labor reform in the US. Remember, those industries were basically privatized,

266
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,280
decentralized. owners had control over how the companies work and what happened to their

267
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:52,960
employees, what happened to their investors, you know, eventually, they had to be regulated

268
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,680
for the safety and well being of, of the people in general of society in general. And that's

269
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,880
actually I think, before too long, we're gonna start seeing legislation to start regulating

270
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,400
crypto. Oh, it's it's already happening. Absolutely. I know it's already happening.

271
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,800
But but history has been a teacher about what happens when there is no central regulation on

272
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:21,040
an industry. All right. I don't know how we got from the Square Enix stuff to NFT in depth

273
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,840
discussion, but it's a good one. So I mean, basically, the whole reason of the the sale

274
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:35,840
was for their NFT market. And I think it's an apt transition is and I think this is something

275
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,520
we have to look at because we're hearing it from all angles. This is where the executives want

276
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,080
this industry to go. And this is one of the things I we have to look at it whether we like it or not

277
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,840
and try to weigh like, what parts of it will work and what parts of it won't work. And I think now

278
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,320
for there's a lot that won't work. What do you want to say that they're just trend hopping?

279
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,000
They're trend hopping. They're trend hopping. They don't know anything. A lot of these companies

280
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,360
have jumped on. They're like, oh, blockchain, blockchain, blockchain. It's like, okay,

281
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,880
well, how are you gonna use it? Blockchain, I mean, like, they don't even know what it is.

282
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,840
Like, for example, the company I work for is like, super, they're like,

283
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
blockchain is the future. Like, how are you gonna use it?

284
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:25,040
Yeah, I don't know. I'm like, Bobby, shut up. Remember when VR was the future or 3d TV?

285
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,480
I do remember when VR was the future in 1996, when the lawnmower man came out, that was VR.

286
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:40,240
Isn't it interesting that it probably took a good what probably 15 years, probably more 15,

287
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:48,080
17 years after that hole. But when VR is the future, it took 15 to 17 years for where now we

288
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:56,960
have HTC Vive, Oculus, PlayStation VR, and VR is finally catching on a lot more. And in many ways,

289
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,960
it's still pretty fresh points to it's still pretty high in many ways.

290
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,080
When the price point comes down to where it's affordable, then it'll catch on more right now

291
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,320
the price to get into it is too high. But it's coming down.

292
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,040
I think at the point that it though becomes mass affordable, no one's gonna care. It won't be

293
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,240
the cool elite thing anymore.

294
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,240
But it'll be a different type of way of interacting with things. And it all it also

295
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,600
depends on like, how to utilize it. Once again, you have Facebook, I'm not calling a meta,

296
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,240
you have Facebook trying to like, come up with this like metaverse thing. It's like,

297
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,080
okay, well, what's that gonna be for? I don't know. I just want to do it. So we changed our

298
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,440
company into meta. It's like, it's stupid. It's like, you don't know why you're doing it.

299
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:50,640
They're doing it to get away from monetization. They're also doing it for their reputation

300
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,680
with all those studies that went on about how they're harming LGBTQIA youth, which is one of

301
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:02,640
the big reasons why I quit using Facebook. It's, they're trying to rebrand themselves.

302
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,360
That's part of it. But you know, there's a lot of good discussion here in in chat. I mean,

303
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,680
Rama brings up a good one. If you follow economic history, he said, I remember when trading foreign

304
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,480
currencies was the big thing. I remember, you know, studying back in the 50s, when people

305
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,920
wanted to invest in gold bullion, you know, when everyone's like, Oh, invest in gold. It's the

306
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:33,920
thing. You know, it what we're dealing with is a very, I'm going to say mature topic that the

307
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,920
younger gamer community isn't necessarily going to be too understanding of. But those of us who

308
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,360
have studied history, those of us who are old enough to understand economics, at least to

309
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:53,040
a decent extent, just because we've seen it and been exposed to it, we can compare where our

310
00:28:53,040 --> 00:29:01,280
gaming industry is crossing over with economy and compare those histories together, we can see those

311
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:09,840
trends. The thing is, is that I call this executive insanity. That the moment that you

312
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:17,760
go to the executive level, you're so focused on company goal that you stopped seeing the big

313
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,880
picture. That's the only company in this industry bolded under you just you just said the biggest

314
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,240
problem in the gaming industry. The thing is, is that the companies that are going to be successful,

315
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,760
I'm going to even expand this into into tech, in general. I work in the tech industry. So

316
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm going to leave it at that. But the best companies in general, just in general companies

317
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,160
and in general, are the ones who can see around the corners. They're the ones who can see the big

318
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,000
picture instead of looking in a straight line. They're going to pull in their analysts from

319
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,920
outside sources. They're going to pull in people from diverse backgrounds.

320
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,200
And they're going to have the people who say, well, this worked in this industry,

321
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,960
this worked in this. I see the parallels here. Why don't we incorporate something new and different

322
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,800
and look at this a different way instead of just doing what everybody the fuck else is doing?

323
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,240
And that's that's exactly why I think Microsoft, especially in the past five years, specifically

324
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,200
the Xbox division is in a place and they're in a great place. And they are a much different

325
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,480
company than the one we started talking about 20 years ago when the show started.

326
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,840
I think micro because the guy at the top of Microsoft is a gamer who gets it.

327
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,480
Also hire me. All right. I'm a really good consultant. I pay attention to shit. I may

328
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,760
not have the background in it, but I pay attention to shit and you need me.

329
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,280
All right. Well, Dark Soccer, before you go prepare your resume, why don't we get into the

330
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,360
next segment about how was your gaming week and what are the types of games that you have been

331
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,320
playing this week? So Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week? I played some Dead by Daylight.

332
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,360
I played badly because I just, I honestly was just like bullshitting around,

333
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,000
you know, trying different builds. I have a very nasty doctor build right now,

334
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,760
which is called Fuck Your Gens. Oh, it includes, what did they change mindbreaker to? Fearmonger?

335
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:22,000
Oh, no. Fearmonger. Yeah. Yeah. It's the scourge hook one that causes your gens to pop.

336
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,320
Pain Resonance. Yeah. Yeah. Pain, not Pain Resonance. Is it?

337
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:35,200
Yeah. Pain Resonance. It was, it was the Onryo one. Yeah. So, and then it was Merciless Storm,

338
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,680
which when your gen is close to being done, you get continuous skill checks.

339
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,280
And, um, yeah, it's what, whatever, what was Jolt before Surge? Yeah, something like that.

340
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,240
They just changed it from one caffeinated soda to the other.

341
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,080
And then I play doctor. I saw it on doctor. I saw a nasty build that combined that Onryo perk,

342
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,960
the, um, the 90% Merciless Storm, it combined that with, um, the Huntress's skill check one.

343
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:11,680
That was, that was disgusting. Yeah. I don't have that unlocked on doctor yet,

344
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:18,240
cause I'm still working on getting everybody prestige. Um, I'm close to having Legion on their

345
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:26,080
next prestige level and the changes for Legion. Oh, they're godly. I mean, I played like a potato,

346
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,920
but I still had fun because like mixing the, their mix tapes. Yeah. The chase music is so good now.

347
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,880
Like, I love it. Also, did you hear that they're, um, they're taking ghost,

348
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
they're changing ghost faces music because everyone hates it.

349
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,360
And there's the, the leak, the D the DBD leak right now.

350
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,800
Apparently the next killer and survivor have leaked because they accidentally put it on the

351
00:32:52,800 --> 00:33:00,000
public test realm. And so somebody got it. And on top of that, there also is information out

352
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,160
that they're doing an expanded secondary resident evil chapter. And so who's the new,

353
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:13,600
that is going to bring in, uh, Ada long, Rebecca, um, Ada long and Rebecca chambers as a survivor

354
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,880
and Wesker as a killer. I knew it had to be Wesker. That's Oh, I didn't hear that. That's

355
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,920
supposed to be chapter 25. That sounds like fanfic, but at the same time, God, do I want

356
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,920
that? I would love to play from DBD leaks and from the same person that leaked the dredge stuff.

357
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:36,720
Wow. And then chapter 26 is supposed to be an unknown survivor and a killer called the night.

358
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,400
That's in can, you know, like really should have, it should have been night, man.

359
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:51,120
Well, the dredge is the, the, the one that leaked for this upcoming chapter is, uh, is, uh,

360
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,240
N I G H T powered thing. Like his whole thing is putting the survivors in total darkness and

361
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,000
basically, uh, transporting around the map and lockers so that a survivor can open the locker

362
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,520
and the killers inside it. And that does sound pretty awesome actually. And on that PT, we miss,

363
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,680
we miss the joke. I was saying that you should have night night, man, and then Charlie. Yeah.

364
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:20,800
Okay. All right. Sorry. I'm slow to the party. They also on the PTB, there are new, uh,

365
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,720
RuPaul's drag station. I'm sorry. RuPaul's police station, Raccoon city. Um, that will have map

366
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,600
variants the way Badham does. Interesting. Changing the layout of like, and I'm looking

367
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,920
at the picture. It's all like covered in the goo and littered and there's like new assets listed

368
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:45,680
on it just means I should have downloaded. I usually keep updating the PTB so I can get the

369
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:50,320
assets from it. That's actually how I have ripped everything from Hawkins while it was still in the

370
00:34:50,320 --> 00:35:01,920
game. Um, but there's also, um, just all kinds of stuff in there. Um, and DBD leaks has been

371
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,400
very reliable. There's been a few times they've been off base, but they've been reliable about

372
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,520
it. You know what I mean? Um, can I say S2100 Matt in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says,

373
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:20,400
so no Baba Duke. Um, no, but pride month is next month. And so, you know, we, we already got the

374
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,480
whole like, Hey, guess what? David's gay. And here's the progress pride flag. Uh, introducing

375
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,120
the Baba Duke as a killer would be a great pride month announcement, but I just, I don't think it's

376
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:37,600
happening. Sorry to say. And I actually watched a really good interview where they said at behavior

377
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:47,360
that they work on something like another six to 10 chapters in advance where they buy the IPs and

378
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:54,640
start their work on it and incorporate feedback from the community. And so, I mean, and you see

379
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,080
how well they work with some of the bigger streamers with the community. And I didn't mean

380
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,280
to turn my, my gaming week into dead by daylight news, but this is pretty big stuff. Yeah. No,

381
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,120
if you're into dead by daylight. And I just want to say, I mean, like, even though the Baba Duke

382
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,000
might be gay rights, like nothing would scream gay rights in dead by daylight, like adding

383
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,240
Toni Collette from Hereditary as a character. So I'm just I'm just saying that because Toni

384
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:23,760
Collette is gay rights. Just saying. The thing is, is that like, how would would

385
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,960
it would killer be her son? She she'd be both a survivor and a killer.

386
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:39,200
Well, there's also another thing going out. This is a rumor mind. Okay. But you know how

387
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,040
when Legion was supposed to come out, they were supposed to be like, their original intent was

388
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:53,040
to be a survivor disguise. Where you didn't know that they were the killer. And of course, that

389
00:36:53,040 --> 00:37:03,520
didn't work. Which is VHS's whole thing. Yeah, yeah. But the but the other thing, though, is

390
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:13,920
that there's rumor about having like a shape shifting killer that can disguise as one of the

391
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:21,600
survivors in game. Interesting. I think it would be an interesting mechanic. But it's still like

392
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,960
vague rumor at this point. All right. So other games I've played. Yes, yes.

393
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,360
I beat Seiken Densetsu 3. Oh, congrats. I was watching your stream the other night. You were

394
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,440
you were stuck on this part for a bit. You were getting really frustrated.

395
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:44,240
Yeah, it was. It was the mana, the mana sanctuary. It's got some they changed the path the pathing

396
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,800
to get back to the mana tree for when the mana tree is dead. Sorry, spoiler for a 25 year old

397
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:59,040
game. But um, but I got to it. I beat the game. I did screen caps at the ending. It was it was

398
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:06,320
perfect. But I do have the poll up because I said I'm always going to do it in a poll even though

399
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:14,880
I'm positive that Terra Enigma is going to win. It's in the lead right now. But there's like two

400
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,000
more days left on the voting. And I'll put up I'll put it in in our chat.

401
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,640
I was gonna say I have not seen your tweet but I was I was hosting a show last night. So

402
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,560
I missed a lot of Twitter stuff. But I'm there's two days left on it.

403
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,880
I'm going to vote in your poll right now for Terra Enigma.

404
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:40,080
Yeah, so um, here, I'll go ahead and just paste it in chat. But at any rate, um, the then that

405
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:45,680
means the game after that I'm going to do is is BS Zelda, the stone tablet legend.

406
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,960
That's a deep dive.

407
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:56,880
So I have the thing for I've also played because I've been trying to get Saturn games that I own

408
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:06,080
to run on my Mac. And so I played the dome patch for Sega Saturn. And I played some radiant

409
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:14,320
Silver Gun. And I played X-Men Children of the Atom. Nice. So I've been getting my Saturn on.

410
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,520
I keep forgetting how hard the dome patch is because I mean, it is a cave game,

411
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,400
but I keep forgetting just because I like the dome patch when it starts off, you know.

412
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,120
That's it. I'm still looking for a Hikaru emulator that will play Planet Harrier.

413
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,240
Let's go to Loki and your gaming week.

414
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,520
Uh, it's all been Minecraft, as usual.

415
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,760
No magic pen gel like your background.

416
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,080
No, no. Sadly, I don't have a PlayStation 2 emulator on my,

417
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:56,800
my PC. Although I mean, I'm sure that'll run like crazy. I did get my Xbox Series X back.

418
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,000
So I'm hopefully gonna hook that up and build play something with it.

419
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:07,680
Um, what is it? I played more of my hardcore series this week, so I made good progress in

420
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,200
that. Once again, recording too much footage for one episode. I had a struggle to get it down to

421
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,480
just the 35 minutes that it was with that, which isn't disappointing because I had a really good

422
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,640
ending that I wanted to put in there. But I had like another four hours of footage to cram in

423
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,720
there. So it's gonna have to be two episodes. Um, but yeah, I, I ended up going to, well,

424
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,440
it'll be in the next episode. I went to the Nether and then immediately left the Nether because it

425
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:42,800
was a horrible place. And I don't want to go there because I'm playing with, you know, um, the 119,

426
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:51,760
um, skulk stuff everywhere. So in it, um, you set off these things that cause like darkness.

427
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,440
It's almost like blindness in the game. And so like, as soon as I stepped through the portal,

428
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,960
like it was still loading in the world and stuff, there's a gas shooting me.

429
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,960
The darkness effect went off twice, which means as soon as I like moved one more time,

430
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,160
the warden would spawn. And then I still had a gas. It shot the portal, broke the portal.

431
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,760
And so I had to relight the portal real quickly and get back through. I was on fire at the same

432
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,280
time. And then I got out and my mind, this isn't a hardcore world. So like I was two and a half

433
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,200
hearts away from dying. Um, I don't know how I managed to survive, but I did. And I have it all

434
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:37,040
on, all on, uh, film basically. So that'll be the, the end possibly to the next episode or,

435
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,680
you know, somewhere in the middle. I haven't decided yet. I have to see how much footage I

436
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,360
have. If I have enough for a full another episode again, but, um, yeah, it was intense. And also

437
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,160
because I updated my world from the first experimental snapshot that they put out

438
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,280
to the new one, the new one, I mean, obviously they're beta snapshots. They're not done yet.

439
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:02,560
Um, the warden doesn't work quite right because he is spawning in daylight and he's not supposed

440
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,520
to do that. And so it made it incredibly dangerous now because before it used to be, okay, well,

441
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,880
just don't get caught out in the dark and you can kind of go wherever you want and do stuff.

442
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,120
Just be careful of the caves and that type of thing. Now it's like, you're dead everywhere you

443
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:23,840
go. You're just in constant danger. So, um, that was a bit fun to demonstrate, but it made good

444
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,400
progress in it and having a lot of fun with it. It's just, I had to be careful because I play it

445
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,360
a lot cause it's fun. But then I ended up with like so much footage. Like the last time I played

446
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,040
it, for example, was the first three episodes that I put out because there was some more work

447
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,640
cause I, cause I had so much footage to go through and it's fine. This is what brings in the views.

448
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,920
I got my, my channels up to 370 subscribers now and you know, there's tons of people that come

449
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,320
in for that series. So I'm obviously going to keep putting it out, but right now, you know,

450
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,760
I've been working on stuff for nerd craft for the next episode. So, um, you know,

451
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,880
kind of balanced between those. All right. Uh, my gaming week, honestly, so I was,

452
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,920
I had a show last night, so I haven't been gaming a lot this weekend. Um,

453
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,960
but as mostly final fantasy 14, um, I wanted to do some streaming this week. I didn't get around

454
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,360
to it because honestly, like I was kind of sick this week. Like I just, yeah, I won't get into

455
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:21,280
not like, um, cough sick, but like stomach sick. Um, so, uh, yeah, it just really put me in a

456
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,480
bad mood and I didn't really want to stream, uh, at all this week, but it pretty much just

457
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,520
play more fancy 14. Like I got my Sage to level 90, so I've maxed another job at 90.

458
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,360
Uh, and I'm working on dancer now trying to get that up. So just pretty much my,

459
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,800
uh, MMO crack is pretty much all I still play. And then of course,

460
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,520
lots of AR games, uh, as long as you're not a dancer in the dark. No, I'm not, uh, Pokemon go

461
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,360
and ingress and Pikmin. And today I forgot they were doing like a event day in Pikmin today. It's

462
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,760
all about carne. It's not technically community day, but it's like, because it's mother's day.

463
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,200
So, you know, happy mother's day to all the moms and motherly figures out there.

464
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:05,440
Um, so, uh, it's carnations, uh, where are the big thing in the game right now? So yeah, so I'll

465
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,920
get around to some other games this week. I actually want to try guardians, the galaxy for

466
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,120
sure. At some point I still have tunic that like came out almost a month ago that I keep meaning

467
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,240
to get into. Cause everybody tells me it's like old school, Zelda, which like one of my favorites.

468
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,400
And I got to get into that. Yeah. So I just, you know, too many games, never enough time

469
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,520
or when there is time, it's always just MMO crack or I guess I did play a little bit of dead by day

470
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,720
life. Only a little bit only. I had some really crappy games and I was like, forget it, forget it.

471
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:42,080
All right. Hey, before I forget what I've got a community thing going on right now, where if,

472
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,240
uh, and I'll keep it up until I get the points for it, but I will play a swift.

473
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,720
I thought, did I donate points for that? I hope I did. I think I did.

474
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,200
It's it's fine, but I might do it a little bit earlier. We'll see. But at this point I am going

475
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:04,080
to go ahead and say goodnight. I'll be in the chat, but my headset's hurting my head. So.

476
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:10,240
All right. Feel better. Thank you. I, and I'm, I'm also not going to stream tonight. So

477
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,520
of course, so everyone, as I tell people when I end my own streams, be kind to yourself,

478
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,000
be kind to others and go forth and conquer. Sounds good. We'll try our best. All right.

479
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,840
Have a good night. All right. Well, we will get into the news at this point. So let's get into

480
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:34,080
our top headline for tonight. Uh, Loki. Yeah. So let's talk more about how Activision sucks

481
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:43,200
and is being sued by more people. So there's been a complaint filed in Delaware, um, asking to see

482
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:49,840
the, uh, financials of Activision Blizzard and also New York city is now suing Activision

483
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:59,680
Blizzard as well. Um, apparently this is because of the, they're saying, uh, was it the fair?

484
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,400
It kind of goes along with, I think with the fair employment and housing, um, suit that they had,

485
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:13,200
but, um, this is so long, basically, uh, I think just trying to, with the announced merger,

486
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,240
they said, uh, their Kotick will be able to escape liability and accountability entirely

487
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,960
and will instead continue to serve in his executive. Um, when the, after the merger

488
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,480
closes, um, worse, despite his potential liability for breaches, for fine, uh,

489
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:36,240
financial, uh, duty, the company's board will allow or allowed Kotick himself to negotiate

490
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,040
the transaction with Microsoft. The board's decision to entrust Kotick with the negotiation

491
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,720
process is inexcusable. And for the additional reason that Kotick stands to personally receive

492
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,000
substantial material benefits, whose value is not directly aligned with the mergers price.

493
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,600
Basically they're finally in the suit because they're, he is going to make out like a bandit

494
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:03,360
in this whole merger thing. If it goes through and people are not happy with that concern,

495
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:11,040
he is kind of good job, New York city, because fuck Bobby Kotick. He should not get a goddamn

496
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,680
thing from what he's done to that company. He's already taken too much. He should pay him back

497
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,800
to be quite honest. We know that's never going to happen. So good job, New York city. Get her Jade.

498
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:29,440
That's what I say. I it's yeah. I, I mean, I, I'm not opposed to Microsoft buying Activision

499
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,000
blizzard because I know it eventually we'll get Bobby Kotick out of the picture and it'll be in

500
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,440
a better place. So this is not an anti-Microsoft cheer. This is 100% an anti Bobby Kotick and no,

501
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:46,560
he shouldn't get a goddamn thing chair. So, um, also deejiram says, this is why you don't fuck

502
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,960
with NYC. Well, I thought this was a very similar thing too. I think there were some states that

503
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,800
were looking into this and essentially it's because governments invest in companies, um,

504
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,960
because a lot of their, um, financial holdings like pension plans, basically pensions for city

505
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,040
employees in New York city, as well as state employees in place like California, you know,

506
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,560
you name it, these pension plans, investing companies to stay financially sound, to be

507
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:19,040
able to pay out these pensions later, when these companies do dumb things, like promising a payout

508
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,640
to an executive who doesn't fucking deserve it. Some of these cities and States look at it as

509
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,160
that's money that essentially could be in our pensions, not directly, but it's, it's money

510
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,800
that the company is paying out that they shouldn't have to, and it damages the value of the company.

511
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,880
So that's why essentially they, at least we know we've had some States that have done that

512
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,120
previously. So, um, yeah, bonds 006 says New York state attorney general. She is on her game.

513
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:55,440
Yes. So props, honestly. Um, so I, I'm glad, I'm glad that Bobby Kotick starting to feel the heat

514
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,280
a little more because that board sure as fuck didn't hold him accountable. And it's really

515
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,400
annoying because that, that board over at Activision blizzard is just as guilty as he is

516
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:11,520
far as I'm concerned. Get rid of them all, get rid of them all, take them out back and

517
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,440
buy them tea. Cause I wouldn't say anything else on this show.

518
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,120
I am tea and then tell them to leave. All right, let's move on.

519
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,880
All right. Let's talk about, I got it. We got, let's talk about summer games Fest.

520
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,440
So summer game Fest is, uh, I would say games cause there's more than one game,

521
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,280
but it is called summer game Fest. Anyway, summer game Fest live will be kicking off on

522
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,520
June 9th, 2022 at two o'clock Easterns. That's 11 o'clock West coast time, our time.

523
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,000
And, uh, this is going to be a big, uh, you know, this is the big Jeff Keeley show where

524
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,320
there'll be a multitude of different game studios unveiling. Uh, this whole

525
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,720
embrace or thing we were talking about earlier in the show, THQ Nordic, they don't do their own

526
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:03,040
press event. So this is a great place to see some of that as an example. Um, and many other places

527
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,240
throughout the industry as well. What I think is interesting about this, this is when E3 would

528
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,600
have been, this is exactly when E3 would have been. Well, yeah, they probably originally timed it to

529
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:20,640
be around when E3 was supposed to be. Yes, because the digital E3 year, which was last year, it was

530
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:28,400
also timed right around the E3 stuff. So that part I'm, you know, uh, but yeah, uh, it is

531
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:36,560
interesting how I think after E3 kind of said, not this year and Jeff Keeley is, you can see

532
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,680
he wants it. He's foaming at the, he wants control of that. And honestly, speaking of,

533
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,840
I mean, we're just going across the realm of incompetent people in the industry tonight

534
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,160
and the ESA right up there, I mean, right up there with them. So, you know,

535
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,160
they're going to send us another email this year saying, Hey, we leaked all your information. Hey,

536
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,520
we know there wasn't even E3s here. That's why we're stepping up our game to leak your

537
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:07,920
information all year that we're not even having E3. So we are a tech organization representing

538
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:15,440
the entire industry and we don't have security. We're a very fluid company and all those leaks

539
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,800
just flow out of our company and all that data so that everybody can see it. We believe in

540
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,480
transparency, but our Alexa rankings that we judge websites and media corporations on our Alexa

541
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:36,720
rankings are secure and trustworthy. Anyway. Oh, where were we? Oh yes. Uh, world premiere.

542
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:44,320
Jeff's favorite phrase in the world. World premiere. World premiere. World premiere.

543
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,920
That's going to be all over Summer Games Fest, uh, trailers, news updates for games as well.

544
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,480
Cause I'm sure you want to know the latest and wait for that same throw delay. Oh, well I'm

545
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,920
when updates I'm saying you want to hear the latest and greatest for like death stranding

546
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:04,960
and you know what Kojima is next. Ooh, do you think? Cause Jeff Keeley is absolutely in bed

547
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,640
metaphorically with Hideo Kojima. Do you think Kojima's next title, which is rumored to be the

548
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:17,440
scary game, whether it's silent Hill or not, do you think Summer Game Fest, that should be the

549
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:24,160
scary game cause he represents the scary game. Yeah. Why not? I like games just saying what they

550
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,320
are like, let's, let's just put it out there. You know what game this is the scary game.

551
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:34,160
So that would be fun. Also, what I think is interesting with this,

552
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:41,920
you will be able to watch this in IMAX theaters. So you can stream it in the comfort of your own

553
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:50,880
home for free, or you can go catch COVID at your local IMAX theater. Hopefully it's not that

554
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,120
dramatic, but why, why would I, why would you go to the theater when you could just watch it? Oh,

555
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,280
I don't know. There, there is something to be said about IMAX and seeing something on a big screen,

556
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,840
you know, that whole presentation. Um, for example, last night we were doing the lost boys

557
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,240
from the eighties on the big screen and now, and I I'd never gotten to see that movie on the big

558
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,520
screen. So getting to see that on the big screen, I was like, Oh, this is kind of fun. So anyway,

559
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:23,440
uh, various IMAX locations in the U S Canada and the UK, uh, probably nothing near us though,

560
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,800
Loki, unless we want to go to the Metreon in San Francisco, I'm going to just guess.

561
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,400
That's not true. They've had it in the past when they've done like the PlayStation stuff.

562
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,400
They've been at most of the IMAX is because it's just a, um, they just beam it in, you know, just,

563
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,200
it's a satellite feed that they basically just, you know, probably not even a satellite at this

564
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:49,040
point, just internet feed that they just stream in. Uh, let's see, Bobby, Bobby Blackwell says,

565
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,600
Jeff should take it to the next level and give out awards at summer game Fest. I mean, why not?

566
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:59,360
Why not? Why not do a more community based award show with some of those things he wants to do?

567
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:04,480
Why not do that show in the summer and then the industry show in the winter? Like you're joking,

568
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,440
but like, actually there could be a lot of good stuff by splitting that up a little bit.

569
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,200
Anyway. All right. Uh, let's move on to our next story. You want to take this one, Loki?

570
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,200
Yeah. I think this is fun. I've been sent this article a lot this week.

571
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,960
The, uh, the video games hall of fame has announced their new inductees for this year.

572
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,520
And it's very exciting because it's a lot of games that are near and dear to our heart.

573
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:36,880
For example, we've got, uh, the legend of Zelda Ocarina of time, Sid Meier's civilization.

574
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,040
Literally my all litter, literally my all-time favorite PC game,

575
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,040
literally my all-time favorite PC game.

576
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,080
Very, uh, Ms. Pac-man, which I like how it's represented by a TV plug and play thing.

577
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,560
Uh, that's hilarious. The machine was a little large for the picture.

578
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,680
Yeah. And then of course, dance dance revolution. It's getting it's due finally.

579
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,240
Which, um, of course I think most people out there know the history of this show,

580
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:10,640
but if you don't, uh, orange L'Andrea started 20 years ago because Loki dark soccer and myself

581
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,360
all met at a local arcade playing dance dance revolution. And for the first two,

582
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,440
three years of our show, if you think dark soccer talks a lot about dead by daylight,

583
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,560
you should see how much we talked about DDR for years, years.

584
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,960
And then finally Konami kind of like stopped release. There's, there's a whole other thing

585
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,920
I could get into about how Konami of Japan were idiots. And they want to take risk of releasing

586
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:38,240
new DDR games out here. And it's only because of one person at Konami over here that we ever got

587
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,440
it in the U S but anyway, I digress. Uh, we just went so long without content.

588
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,720
It was like, well, I guess we should talk about other video games too, cause there's no new DDR,

589
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:52,000
but it's really exciting to see DDR getting its due. And you know what it's had the effect that

590
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,400
it sat on the gaming industry. Cause if you think about it, you know, it's much more than that

591
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:02,560
machine that's bopping cheesy Eurodance tunes, but DDR made its way into school gymnasiums.

592
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,480
Like we have to remember people of a certain age, like you and I Loki,

593
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,920
when it was the winter time and physical education, we used to do square dancing,

594
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,160
right? I don't know about your school, but that was the thing is like during the rainy season,

595
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,080
we do square dancing inside the gym. Cause we couldn't go outside and play cause it was raining

596
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:25,520
all the time. Was that what they did at your school too? Um, yes, we did square. I think

597
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:32,960
they did square dancing and then like, um, I think there was other types of dancing that

598
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,320
they did as well. Like, I don't know if they did like salsa ballroom, like maybe salsa or

599
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,360
something. It was other, other types. It wasn't just square dancing, but yes, I remember square

600
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,120
dancing. But, but with the point I'm getting to, and I think y'all know where I'm going with this,

601
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:53,680
is that now for kids today, there's a lot of schools where winter phys ed is that DDR school

602
00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:00,720
edition where like you do dance, dance revolution as a class. And now that, which is mind blowing

603
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,480
to me, that's, that's where we're at now. So DDR, you know, became a much bigger thing. It became

604
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,400
like a physical ed thing. And, you know, obviously DDR is still in the industry. We know there's

605
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,720
DDR ACE and, you know, in the arcade and you know, those, those are still coming out. I still,

606
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:21,280
you know, in the, that you a Bamani loyalist to this day, I love you. And you are going to hate

607
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:27,840
me for saying this. That's still a very niche thing. And it's only niche because Konami doesn't

608
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:33,040
care about home entertainment anymore. Um, and doesn't care and releasing peripherals and

609
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:38,160
releasing any of that in the home. So it's, it, you have to go to a round one or a Dave and

610
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:44,080
busters to find that stuff. And people just don't go there every day, you know? So, um,

611
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,720
still waiting with bitty breath for our, our round one to open up at some point,

612
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:55,040
a theaters open, um, early June was last I heard. Yeah. Keep them pushed back. I know

613
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:02,800
technically spring. So anyway, but, but DDR has had a lasting impact beyond just the machine,

614
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,440
you know, you, me and dark soccer all played years and years ago and the multiple mixes as

615
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,440
a result of that, like DDR became physical education activity, like, you know, teaching tool,

616
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,640
uh, in that regard. So, um, I, it absolutely earned its place in the hall of fame for sure,

617
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:24,560
but it's also wild to think about that game came out originally in 1998,

618
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:33,440
this show 20 years old started about DDR. Yep. Oh, you know, it's funny.

619
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,560
Uh, just announced tonight on the show prior to us, Bobby black Wolf,

620
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:42,480
Bobby black Wolf is going to be doing announcing again for summer games done quick, which is

621
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,720
awesome. Congratulations, Bobby. Nice. But it's the first time he's doing it in person because

622
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,400
summer games done quick is good. Or, you know, that's extremely exciting. That's yeah. It's

623
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,320
going to be in person again. So he gets to go out to Minneapolis for an entire week to do it.

624
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,800
Well, because of when it's time to guess what he's not going to be here, June 26,

625
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,240
my birthday and the same night that happens to be pretty much, Oh, technically the birthday

626
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:11,200
is on June 23rd, but the 26 will be the closest show to that day. So he's going to miss our will,

627
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,080
ours 20th anniversary. Luckily we all love games done quick here and think it's an

628
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:21,120
outstandingly worthy cause. So I'm not that pressed about it. I get it, but I just think

629
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:30,080
it's funny. So all right. Anyhow, let's move on something, something not as funny. Well,

630
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:35,680
it depends on your sense of humor. Maybe it is funny. Yeah. So, uh, the Prince of Persia remake

631
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:43,520
is having some issues. So it's been delayed quite a bit. Um, they originally estimated to come out,

632
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:50,720
uh, January, 2021. And I didn't even remember that it was supposed to come out then.

633
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:58,000
And right now it's changing studios again. So, uh, um, yeah, they put out a, uh,

634
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,360
the Prince of Persia, Twitter put out an update on development of Prince of Persia,

635
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:08,320
the sands of time remake. And of course they went over, uh, what was going on there.

636
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:12,560
It says the development of Prince of Persia, sands of time remake will now be led by Ubisoft

637
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:19,200
Montreal. Uh, the decision is important, um, important step and the team building upon the

638
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:26,800
work that she's by, uh, Ubisoft, uh, was it Pune? I don't really understand how they pronounce that

639
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:32,640
and Ubisoft, uh, Mumbai, and now they will take the time. They need to regroup and on the scope

640
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:39,120
of the game and deliver you the best experience. Um, so yeah, it's going to take more time.

641
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:48,560
I honestly forgot to be honest. I don't know. I forgot it was coming out too. I just assume

642
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:53,760
it had come out and nobody noticed or something like that. I mean, that's, that's neat. I guess

643
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:00,320
that they're still working on it. I mean, all right, cool. What are we going to do?

644
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,720
Uh, yeah, maybe I'll check it out when it actually comes out. If it's serviceable. I mean,

645
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,080
it sounds like the game has a lot of issues, but maybe, you know, at least they're taking the time

646
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,640
to fix them and they're not releasing a product that's broken. So there is that, um, as 200

647
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,920
Matt and Chad says, I forgot this was being worked on. I wouldn't be shocked if it's canned

648
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,480
at some point. Well, they're sticking to it for some reason. They're sticking to it. Like they're

649
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:29,040
sticking to, uh, that beyond good and evil sequel, right? Oh God. Speaking about things I forgot

650
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:34,720
about. That's right. That was supposed to be a thing, wasn't it? All right. Yeah. That was

651
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:41,520
announced way before Prince of Persia. So, you know, yeah. All right. You know, you know, no,

652
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:48,640
but you know what sequel we're going to get a lot sooner than that. Um, more of them not denouncing

653
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:53,680
all of this sexual harassment and, uh, bigotry that's going on in their company. We're getting

654
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,480
plenty of sequels for that where they just don't denounce that. So look forward to that very soon.

655
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:04,240
Maybe a trailer, a world exclusive trailer at summer games fast. Ouch, because it's true.

656
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,480
All right. Moving on to the next topic. I don't know why we're talking about roadblocks,

657
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:17,520
but we are because it's the biggest game in the world. We have one. I just don't really follow,

658
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,160
but yes, you're right. I know, I know. And it's, you know, they're making their own stuff in there.

659
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:28,560
Yeah, exactly. Well, now another company that is teaming up with Roblox is Spotify. So yes,

660
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,680
there is a new space in Roblox called Spotify island, where you can create music, chill in a

661
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:40,000
virtual venue and get exclusive virtual merchandise. And it's out now. Uh, it looks very green, just

662
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,200
like the Spotify logo. Uh, there's icons that are consistent with the apps and so forth. You can

663
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:51,760
also collect like icons for free merch. Uh, also, uh, artists will have the chance to connect with

664
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,160
fans as a way to earn money. A portion of the sales will go to artists, other than not saying

665
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:01,520
how much that is and what acts are really being collaborated with, but there's supposedly that's

666
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:07,120
in process. You know, we're available on Spotify as a podcast. Where's our island. Are we on

667
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:12,080
Spotify island? That's what I need to know. Can you listen to OLR on Spotify island?

668
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,600
I don't know. Or can you only listen to Joe Rogan because

669
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,680
that's the kids need to connect with Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. So

670
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:28,400
anyway, sorry, I had a hairball. Um, apparently the virtual world is full of Easter eggs. You

671
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:34,400
can find along the way. Uh, also you can do music and sounds with a beat maker station.

672
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:40,640
It's powered by soundtrack. Spotify bought them in 2017. So if you want to see what they used it

673
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:46,080
for, there you go. The first themed experience will be debuting in a few weeks. It's called

674
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:53,200
K park and it's all about K-pop. So you can interact with stray kids and soon me, uh, and

675
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:59,440
that won't be the last. So I can't wait for all the K-pop stands to just fly. That's the name

676
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,400
of abandoned, not just actual stray kids. So you wouldn't necessarily want to enter.

677
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:14,880
Well, all right. Let's see. Uh, bonds 006 says upon hearing this news, looks at Sony and home

678
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,080
and Sony music and the other labels they have. Yeah. Right. Like Sony could have had this.

679
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:25,200
They're late to the party. I mean, honestly, like this is basically like this and what they're

680
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:30,560
doing like in Fortnite kind of is more metaverse than the metaverse stuff. I mean, honestly,

681
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,000
I mean, this is what they kind of wanted is this whole thing where they can have spaces that

682
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:39,280
you can create and interact with different things and monetize the crap out of it. And so

683
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:45,120
here we are. I mean, Sony was doing that with home. I mean, they probably would if they,

684
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:49,120
you know, they could have had a Spotify place that you could have gone and visited in home.

685
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:53,920
If they had thought to involve K-pop, because I'll tell you what, K-pop stands

686
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,560
are the scariest stands on the internet and they're, they're going to flock to it.

687
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:04,640
As 200 Matt says, K-pop stands will break the network. A hundred percent. A hundred percent.

688
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:15,600
Let's move on to our next story. Uh, yes. So apparently NFT is still bad. Um,

689
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:22,080
there's folks that are fans, I guess, of the bored ape yacht club who are trying to buy

690
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:28,640
video game land. This is with the other deed collection where they can basically claim land

691
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:36,800
in, I guess, a space called the, uh, other side. And they say it's a play to earn gaming project

692
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:44,320
that's supported by their new crypto token, ape coin. Cause of course they have to have a token

693
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:49,760
on top of their NFTs and stuff. Cause why not? Um, definitely not going to be a rug pull because

694
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:57,040
that's not what any of these are ever. Um, but apparently though there's, um, other side was

695
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:05,040
intended to launch in April, but hasn't, um, really come out yet. And based on that, there's been,

696
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:13,600
you know, basically this is a big scam, I guess. Um, yeah. The other, other deed sale,

697
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:19,520
they said, uh, which launched at the end of April, uh, which includes, uh, Yuga labs,

698
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,400
which is the company, I guess the largest NFT mint in history. I think they're the ones behind

699
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:32,000
the bored ape yacht club. And, um, yeah, apparently they've had an issue with a lot of

700
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,880
failed transactions. They said due to the incredible demand being forced through the

701
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:43,200
Ethereum's bottleneck, uh, for those affected, we appreciate your willingness to build alongside us.

702
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:52,960
Um, but know that we've got your back on refunding your gas. So apparently what's happening,

703
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,840
I think is that they're paying money to buy these tokens, but the transaction's failing,

704
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,320
but they're not getting their money back type of thing.

705
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,560
And I don't want to just repeat the conversation we had earlier in the show,

706
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:11,120
but as long as this is representative of what NFTs are, they are never period bolded,

707
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:17,440
underlined, italicized. I will own that comment. They will never be successful. As long as this is

708
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:22,240
what's representing NFT, these games that they're coming up with to like force NFT to happen,

709
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:27,360
force fetch to happen in these games, not going to happen, kids, not going to happen.

710
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,200
You got to figure out a way to make it work with something that already exists out there.

711
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,400
Yeah. So the other thing too is, uh, earlier this week, actually on the fourth, they,

712
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:42,560
the yugolabs had announced that they'd refunded everyone's gas fees, um, that everyone that had,

713
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:48,160
uh, failed transactions. However, um, lots of folks still haven't received a refund.

714
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:55,040
And on top of that, there's also someone created a fake other side website that conned some of the

715
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:02,720
NFT holders out of more NFTs. Again, losing $6.2 million worth of NFTs. Once again, it's like,

716
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:08,400
when you ever hear an NFT story, it's always either a rug pull scam or someone's dealing them

717
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:15,840
via like some sort of, um, you know, malware or just, you know, your old school

718
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:24,080
kind of a phishing scam to try to get that kind of stuff. So I don't know.

719
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:30,880
What a fucking mess. That's all we have to say. Next up, next topic.

720
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:38,880
Yeah. So, uh, of course, you know, with a lot of these big acquisitions, you know,

721
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:45,120
there are going to be some new regulatory bodies looking into them. So the FTC is actually

722
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:51,360
investigating Sony's proposed bungee acquisition. Uh, they're saying that it's, you know,

723
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:57,360
they're looking to, um, make sure that I guess it's not going to be more, I don't really know,

724
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:02,080
like anti-competitive. I'm surprised they're looking at that and not necessarily the Activision

725
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,880
Blizzard one. Cause I think that the bungee one is much smaller scale than Activision Blizzard,

726
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,800
but I haven't heard that they're looking into that, but I would assume that they

727
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,840
should if they aren't already. Um, so yeah, I think that's pretty par for the course though,

728
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:21,600
that they would look into, you know, acquisitions like that, but we'll see if that might give their

729
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,840
blessing or not. I don't think this is as big of a deal as like the gaming media. I mean, it's a,

730
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:30,880
it's a, it's a clickbait headline in this case. I really don't think this is, of course, they're

731
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,480
going to investigate it with this big of a tree. Is it like you just said, it's, it's such a huge

732
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,920
transaction that of course they're going to investigate it. Um, and I don't, I don't think

733
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:44,240
this should be concerning it. This is there's, I feel like what gaming journalism in some ways is

734
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:50,320
trying to do is like, try to equate this to the Microsoft Blizzard merger and all the problems

735
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:55,360
that are going on there. This, that is apples to oranges people. Right. And I don't think that

736
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,920
they've necessarily done that yet. And speaking of Microsoft, I mean, they did investigate the,

737
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:07,600
um, acquisition of Bethesda back when they did that in, uh, was that 2021? Right. So I mean,

738
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,440
it's not like unheard of that they do this. And I would imagine that the same thing is going to

739
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:18,240
happen with the Activision acquisition, although we don't know, like that's probably still later

740
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:24,560
on down the line. Like they haven't really merged yet or like, or I don't think they're at that

741
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,960
point where they're investigated yet. Um, maybe because of all the crazy stuff going on with

742
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:34,240
Activision, but, um, I'm sure it will happen. I'm sure they'll look at it. They're not going

743
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,840
to be like, Oh, we're going to investigate this $3 billion one, but the other one,

744
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:46,000
the $70 billion one, that one's cool. All right. Well, let's move on to our next story

745
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:53,120
and talk about this. This is interesting. So, um, Fortnite is now available on X cloud gaming,

746
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:59,360
which is X boxes, X boxes powered, um, or, you know, Microsoft's, uh, cloud service. Right.

747
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:06,240
But what's interesting about this is that this is basically created a way now to play Fortnite

748
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:13,680
on an iPhone again, because Apple, what's that? I said, check me Apple. I'll get to that. I'll

749
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:19,360
get to that. So Epic games basically is now made, you know, Fortnite available on iPhone again,

750
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,360
because of the X cloud partnership, because you can just, you can do X cloud on the web,

751
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,480
even on a mobile device. So you can do that. So of course, Tim Sweeney goes and writes a tweet

752
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:34,640
and says, well, Fortnite's now available without the Apple tax. I'm summarizing that tweet. I

753
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,320
don't remember the exact tweet, but he's basically trying to say now you can do Fortnite and there's

754
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:45,040
no Apple tax, but I'm looking at that going. What about the Microsoft tax? Because it's still

755
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:53,440
running on X cloud. And as far as I know, Microsoft Sony, they all charge 30% as well.

756
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,840
Now, maybe the difference is it has to do that whole thing where Apple was very mad about the

757
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:04,240
back door and all that stuff. And, uh, they didn't want to have, um, uh, a way to, uh, you know,

758
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:10,320
buy them on the web and maybe Microsoft is allowing that, I guess. Um, but yeah, so this is,

759
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:19,040
uh, this is interesting how that's happened. So, um, but yeah, so Fortnite's now available to play

760
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:26,560
on all those devices if you want, but technically the headline is Fortnite is now on Xbox cloud

761
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:32,960
gaming. It just has this interesting side effect of now Tim Sweeney is hyping it up as,

762
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:41,760
Oh, we're back on this. So it's interesting. So, all right. So now this is the part of the

763
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,480
show where things are going to get very interesting here, but I'll explain here in

764
01:12:46,480 --> 01:13:01,520
a minute because we have a segment to do. So let's roll the bumper. And now it's time to travel back

765
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:07,520
to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

766
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:18,960
It's time for the classic game of the week. So here's the problem. Dark soccer had picked a game.

767
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:24,000
I don't know anything about it. And I wouldn't want to do a game she picked anyway,

768
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,440
cause it's her game to talk about in her memory. It's not mine, especially when I don't know the

769
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,400
game. So we have to, and we haven't really had notice or time to prepare. So I had to pull

770
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:40,320
something literally out of the blue. However, I checked the Wiki and this game has not been done

771
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:46,240
before, believe it or not. So, uh, Loki, you're going to have to help me with tonight's classic

772
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:51,920
game of the week because, and I can't, I can't tell you why I was inspired to pick this game,

773
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:59,680
but the classic game of the week tonight is let me get it up here. Uh, magic pen gel.

774
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:07,680
It's a classic game of the week. So, and well, it's funny cause I was like, surely we did this

775
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:13,040
as a classic game at some point because we did. I thought we did too, but I am on the Wiki right

776
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:19,120
now. I'm looking at it and I just did a control find. I'm like magic. Okay. There was magical

777
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,960
night dreams and magic. Nope, no match. That's why you just heard that flip because they can't

778
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:28,400
find a search for it. So there is no magic pen gel. It's not there. We just talk about it on

779
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:34,640
the show an awful lot. So there you go. So, but we can talk about magic pen gel now. So let's talk

780
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:41,680
about this. Um, and yeah, dark soccer and chat says, damn, it's old enough. Uh, Oh, and she said

781
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,800
I could have done the other game. I didn't know anything about that game, dark soccer. I didn't

782
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:51,840
want to do it. This played this game before. Yes. This game is old enough. It came out in

783
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:58,000
North America, June 24th, 2003. So this game is damn near 20 years old. It actually came out in

784
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,800
Japan, March 20th, 2002. So in Japan it's over 20 years old at this point. Okay. It's called magic

785
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:14,160
pen gel, the quest for color. It's a original name. Garakuta Meisaku Geijo Rakugake Okoku

786
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:18,560
is the original name of the game. It's a role playing game that was developed by Garakuta

787
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:24,240
studio and title for the PlayStation two here in North America. It was published by age tech

788
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:28,720
apparently studio Ghibli was involved in this game because the musical compositions in the

789
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:33,840
game were done by Zuntada. So there was also a sequel for the game that came later called

790
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,080
graffiti kingdom, but we're not talking about that tonight. Basically, what is this game? It's

791
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:45,840
Pokemon meets Mario paint. That's what it is. You create your own little creatures in a in game

792
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:52,560
drawing system that actually worked pretty well to basically do a version of Pokemon.

793
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:57,040
The pen gels are with it. So they're not called Pokemon. They're called, I'm sorry. The pen gel

794
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:04,000
is a little pen fairy thing that creates the doodles. So the doodles are actually

795
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,760
the little Pokemon. And so you sketch out what the body looks like and you have a certain amount

796
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,800
of magic energy. So like the link is, or the ink, excuse me, isn't unlimited. You have a certain

797
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:18,640
amount of it. And you do these battles with the custom created design, you trade with other

798
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,960
players. You know, it's interesting with this whole discussion about NFT tonight,

799
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,120
these magic pen gels could be NFTs essentially.

800
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:33,600
Yeah, it's like our horrible 2d x controller that we stuff fight.

801
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,120
Oh yeah, that's right. We drove drew like a 2d extra toy. This game was well,

802
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,400
Loki, why don't you talk about some of your memories with this game? Because you played

803
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:44,720
this more than I did really? Yes. Yeah. So it was fun because you did get the draw,

804
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:48,480
whatever you wanted in there. And based on the colors that you use, you'd have different

805
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:53,360
abilities. So I think like they have like, you know, magic abilities or physical attack and

806
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:57,520
stuff like that. It would depend on like the ink colors or paint colors they got. I think you would

807
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:03,200
unlock more as you went along. So of course, you know, we had, I think we had a 2d x controller

808
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:09,280
that we made. There was just one it was just a big, like box. It was just like a big blue box

809
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:14,640
thing. And of course, and the chat room is lighting up going penis, penis, penis, penis.

810
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:21,520
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, come on. Yeah, of course. We did that worldwide audience here on Twitch.

811
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:26,960
Come on. Of course, drawing a gigantic penis and balls was like one of the first

812
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:33,520
monsters created in this game. Everybody does it. Come on. It was fantastic. Yes. Such a glorious

813
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:39,440
game. In fact, I'm surprised this game wasn't called magic penis, because that's what everybody

814
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:46,160
made for their doodles. It was great, though, like, the thing about graffiti kingdom, though,

815
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:50,480
is a little bit different. So like, this game is more of a traditional kind of like RPG, like,

816
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,640
you like would battle and stuff. And they have like turn based battles. Whereas I think

817
01:17:54,640 --> 01:18:02,080
graffiti kingdom was more of a like an action RPG type thing, you would just kind of like,

818
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,440
roam the world and do them things. I never actually played graffiti kingdom. But

819
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:13,440
yeah, this game was pretty fun. It was the drawing technology in the game was based on

820
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:19,440
Takeo Igarashi's teddy software. And I'm not sure what else that was used in. But apparently,

821
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:23,680
it is a sketching interface for 3d design. So it was kind of based on something that

822
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:28,640
was already out there, which I think is very interesting. On the reception to this game,

823
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,880
it was average pretty much, you know, a lot of seven and eights around the board, C plus

824
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,160
things like that for me to gave it a 32 out of 40. So for me to you know, not bad,

825
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,920
especially in those years now they hand out 40s like they're nothing but back then that was still

826
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:49,760
still something in a review by IGN. It was noted that the monster creation system lives up to a

827
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:54,400
potential for creating unique looking creatures and providing gameplay depth, different body

828
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,880
parts, colors and sizes affected abilities and statistics in battle. Yeah, that was I always

829
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:02,080
thought that was really interesting, too. Even if at the end of the day, they're saying it was

830
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:07,520
a giant game of rock, paper, scissors. The variety of attacks and spells with the custom monsters

831
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,960
could be kind of funny. And you know, what's cool is that Teddy software is it's a 3d modeling asset

832
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:21,360
now for unity. Oh, we can make a sequel. That's kind of neat, though. So you could so you could

833
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:26,320
bring back the 2d x machine and the penis monster and put them in a unity asset game basically is

834
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,560
what you're saying. Sure, you could totally do that. It's not expensive. It's like 30 bucks.

835
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:36,160
Just what I've always wanted. All right. Anyhow, let's see the care of some of the characters from

836
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:41,680
the game Zoe and Taro. They showed up later in a game called lost magic on the Nintendo DS,

837
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:49,120
which was also made by Tyto. So it looked like they aged a bit but that was magic pen gel. So

838
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,520
it was a lot of fun memories, especially if you go back to like early OLR. Because again,

839
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:00,320
that game came out during the first or second year of OLR. When we were doing three hours

840
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:07,120
every week about literally nothing. We played this game a lot and it was it was a good time

841
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:11,600
many memories playing this game just because it was just silly to draw that it was it was

842
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:18,720
neat to draw them in a 2d space and see them 3d animated. That's what it was. It's like you could

843
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:24,960
draw a 2d x machine you could draw a boner you could draw all sorts of horribly animated

844
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:33,040
in 3d but it was so like bad it was funny type of thing. So yeah, anyway, magic pen gel I would

845
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:38,240
consider it a cult classic. And that's our classic game of the week for sure. I love this game.

846
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:46,000
Anyway, there it is. Good pick Loki that inspired me to throw it in the back if you want to continue

847
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:51,680
watching the game Loki has it running behind him right now. Like I said, I can't imagine why I

848
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:56,560
thought to do this as the classic game of the week. But I was like surely surely that had been

849
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:02,160
picked at some point. Oh, no, no, no. Alrighty, then there we go. We'll do it tonight. We'll do

850
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:09,280
it live. All right, moving on. Let's get into some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other

851
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:13,680
headlines around the industry. We'll start with Loki. I'll take the one that Jamie had. So I'll

852
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:19,680
take her story. You can do the other two lucky. All right. So the steam deck can now officially

853
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:24,480
run a ton more games than of course, when it launched. So I think when it launched,

854
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:31,520
it was about 400 games or so that were playable. Now they're almost up to 2500 games that are

855
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:40,240
playable. And then they verified it looks like about like 1200 of those that are, you know,

856
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:48,400
able to run I guess really well on the team deck. Yeah, 12 or 1289 games are fully verified.

857
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:58,240
And they said a further 11 or 1169 are playable. I'm not sure what exactly the difference between

858
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:04,320
playable and verified me, I guess just how will they run? Maybe like graphical bugs,

859
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:09,600
skipping audio hiccups, like just probably performance just with like the chip that's

860
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,960
on there, the APU and stuff. So but yeah, that's cool. Let's see that a lot more are compatible

861
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,200
now. So yeah, I mean, everyone's pretty excited about the steam deck. So yeah,

862
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,320
but the early stuff I've heard is pretty good. I'm getting to the point where I think I kind

863
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,320
of want one. But now I'm just going to hold off and wait and see if valve refreshes the hardware

864
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:30,000
in it. It's still really hard to get obviously, as you know, there's still shortages and stuff.

865
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,760
But I think at some point, you know, we had the story last week about how some of that is easing

866
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:38,880
up. And I'll wait to see when valve does the inevitable refresh of the steam deck and kind

867
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,440
of beefs up what's inside it, then maybe I'll try to get one.

868
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:50,320
Yeah. So Sonic the Hedgehog Two is now officially the highest grossing movie adaptation of a video

869
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:59,440
game franchise at the US box office. They are they've reached $331 million. Whereas the previous

870
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:08,160
movie was 319 million. So they, which is pretty good, considering that the 319 million I mean,

871
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:14,560
I don't know what that necessarily means as far as this movie, but like, it made 319 million during

872
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,960
2020. Which, you know, when movie theaters are closed,

873
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, there were so many movie theaters that for like an entire year still had Sonic the

874
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,160
Hedgehog movie posters up because that was the big movie that came out the weekend before everything

875
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:34,560
shut down. Yeah, it's good movie. Good movies. Yeah. How much would the first one have made if

876
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,960
COVID didn't happen the way it did? That's a very, yeah, would that but it's hard to say

877
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:44,800
sequels almost always, you know, for big AAA franchises, sequels almost always outgrow the

878
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:50,400
original, which is why the bar for this new avatar, which I guess there's a there's a teaser

879
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:55,200
trailer that's been shown. I did not see it. Yeah, I've only seen like the reaction online

880
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:59,520
and stuff. So I don't I don't know if it just showed in random theaters or what or it was

881
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:05,360
supposed to be before Dr. Strange, but I, I went to the bathroom right before the move. Well,

882
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:11,440
like is typically at the movie theater and I was shocked. Typically, the movie times that they give

883
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:17,680
you is like practically when they start rolling trailers. But ironically, this time, the movie

884
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:23,680
started at the movie time. And so the trailers were actually earlier. So I missed like a trailer

885
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:29,680
or two. But yeah, who cares? It's Avatar. It's like way too late for a sequel for that. But

886
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:40,960
whatever. I cheddar cheddars here. Hi. cheddar does not like being picked up. Okay, bye cheddar.

887
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:46,400
Anyway, um, but y'all wanted me to get cheddar on stream during all our at some point. So there you

888
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:51,680
go. Anyway, yeah. So Bobby says that he saw the trailer before strange. Alright, so I thought

889
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:56,160
because I you would think it'd be all over Twitter by now like leaks of the trailer and stuff. But

890
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:02,640
yeah, they were just, you know, uploaded to YouTube like, yeah, movie studios do. But I

891
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:08,480
was just saying the bar for that one is going to be incredibly high. But anyway, um, it's

892
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:14,240
many folks in chatter saying cheddar did not look please know he doesn't really love getting picked

893
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:18,960
up. I did that for y'all because I promised I'd put cheddar on stream at some point. So

894
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,840
all right, if I put his little toy on that table back there, he might get up on that. So we'll see.

895
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:29,680
I'll try that again later. Anyway, um, what else is it gonna say with that? Oh,

896
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:35,520
I was just surprised honestly, that Sonic two is like the biggest video game movie,

897
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,480
but then I'm like, well, I guess really, what else would there have been? Right? Like either

898
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:46,240
it came out in the 90s. And there's been inflation since the 90s. But there hasn't been a lot recently

899
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,600
that like, you know, what a bowl movie was going to make that kind of money.

900
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:56,320
Haha. Well, there is a Pokemon. Yeah, yeah. Detective Pikachu. That did really well.

901
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:01,840
But not that well, not as well, Sonic. I mean, honestly, there hasn't been a lot of

902
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,880
video game franchise movies that have come out that have done a lot. Yeah.

903
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:14,320
So it'll be, but now it's an article because it's slow. Here's, here's the other question.

904
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:22,160
How long will Sonic to hold that crown? Because that Mario movie, I know it got bumped to 2023.

905
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:27,680
And I'm, I'm sorry to make it a Mario versus Sonic thing, but let's be real. There's a lot

906
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:31,760
of people that are going to see that Mario movie. A lot of people that are going to take their kids

907
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:36,560
to see that Mario movie. I think Sonic's probably going to get to thrown by Mario,

908
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:42,560
which is hilarious to say. You got to, you got to admit there's a certain, I know, I know we got

909
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:47,040
like tiger claws, a huge Sonic fan in the chat, but you have to admit there's something funny

910
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:51,440
about me saying Sonic's about to get kicked out, get, get his butt kicked by Mario.

911
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:58,400
But I think it is still, you know, that's still a huge accomplishment for Sonic. Cause honestly,

912
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,680
I never would have thought the first movie would have done as well as it did. And I don't know if

913
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,520
that, and that's no, no shade. It's just that video game movies don't tend to typically do

914
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:14,720
that well. So it, you know, did great. Phoenix 77, 26 says, Rob, there was a uncharted movie

915
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:19,840
a few months ago. Oh yeah. That's right. Yeah. That ain't breaking a box.

916
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:26,400
No, it is not. No, it is not. Orange. Right. It says how well did the angry birds movie do?

917
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:32,400
Not 300 million. Well, but those were actually pretty good. I like the first one. I've watched

918
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,960
the first one several times. I have not watched the second one, but the first one was pretty good.

919
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:42,400
All right. All right. In one other rapid fire news story here tonight,

920
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:48,480
Jason talked about this in the intro tonight, but it's, it's interesting. The gold plated

921
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:58,080
Nintendo Wii. It's a one of a kind Nintendo Wii is going up for auction. THQ who not the same THQ

922
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:03,120
Nordic that exists today, because this was the THQ before they went bankrupt and had had their

923
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:10,320
name bought by THQ Nordic. So the old THQ, uh, made this 24 karat gold plated Wii,

924
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:15,200
and they were intending to give it to queen Elizabeth in 2009. The whole fucking thing

925
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:21,520
was promotion for a flop game called big family games. Anyone remember big family games? We had

926
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:27,120
any big family games fans out there. You can probably tell by the title alone. It was that

927
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:35,200
kind of Wii title. And there was, it was like, look, we're like Wii sports too. Please buy us.

928
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:40,160
There's so many of them. So many of them. Yeah. I would have thought it was Mario party,

929
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:45,200
but all right. But anyway, maybe we'll get a sequel to big family games on the switch.

930
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:53,280
However, here's the funny part. It never actually got to the queen because there is a very strict

931
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:58,720
Royal gift policy because who knows, maybe they thought there'd be anthrax in that Wii or

932
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:02,640
something. So they don't, they don't allow the queen to get gifts like that. So it was returned

933
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:11,360
to THQ. A collector got it from a studio contact in 2017. And now a Dutch collector named Don,

934
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:16,640
who runs, I guess, console variations is now putting this up for sale.

935
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:24,320
Originally, Don tried to sell this on eBay in October, 2021 for $300,000. However,

936
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:29,680
eBay originally shut them down because that's too much money. So now the auction is up at

937
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:36,400
golden, which is a place that allows these types of things. Bidding is already up to $2,000. I want

938
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:42,400
to actually see what it's at. Is it 3000 now? But like they give you big family games with it and

939
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:49,200
you, whoopee. Who wants to buy the gold-plated Wii so you can mod it?

940
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,720
I do. I want to mod it. I ain't paying for it.

941
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:02,960
Well, you know what it won't do? Load the Wii shop or have online multiplayer because those

942
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:08,640
features are no longer available. Anyway, the whole thing's a big publicity stunt,

943
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,600
but it's an actual gold-plated Wii. I guess it works.

944
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:12,960
So there's that.

945
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:16,560
And the gold plating's chipping off on it. Ooh, that looks so great.

946
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,520
DarkSakura still hanging out in our chat and lending her endless wit,

947
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,680
saying golden Wii is a sign of dehydration. We'll leave it at that.

948
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:31,040
Ssho100matt points out this title, the big family games, this gets localized,

949
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,920
but not President Cat. Don't get me started.

950
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,160
Well, to be fair, big family games was probably in English,

951
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:43,440
so it'd take nothing to localize it. But yes, it's a terrible game.

952
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,920
What's Mother 3's excuse? Happy Mother's Day.

953
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:51,200
All right. By the way, can I just say, again, Reggie Fils-Aime doing this whole book tour.

954
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,760
So of course everyone's asking him about Mother 3.

955
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,560
And now he's posting tongue-in-cheek tweets about the whole thing.

956
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,280
Reggie, you're great.

957
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:05,200
I've been enjoying the interviews I've been seeing with you in it.

958
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,000
I really can't wait to read your book.

959
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,720
I really admire you, Reggie, and what you've done for the industry.

960
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,360
Please just shut up about Mother 3.

961
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,480
You're just pouring salt in the wound.

962
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,240
Please just shut up about Mother 3.

963
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,480
Just say, it didn't happen.

964
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,320
It's not everything happens in the end.

965
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,360
Now shut up and move on.

966
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,200
Just please, for all of our sake.

967
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,400
And people, the rest of the industry, stop asking him about it.

968
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,080
He doesn't work for Nintendo anymore.

969
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,600
Stop asking him what happened.

970
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,480
It just, it didn't happen.

971
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:36,640
Moving on.

972
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:40,400
Let's talk about some games that will come out, unlike Mother 3,

973
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,720
in a segment called World Release Dates.

974
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,320
Let's start with the U.S., Loki.

975
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:50,960
We have IUDEN Chronicles Rising on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,

976
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,000
and Xbox Series.

977
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:57,520
Salt and Sacrifice on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

978
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:04,320
We Were Here Forever on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

979
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,160
Let's see.

980
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:13,360
Brigadine, The Legend of Runzea, I don't know.

981
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,240
That's going to be out on PC.

982
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:26,480
And then we have the Centennial Case, a Shinjima story on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

983
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,840
PlayStation 5.

984
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,320
And last but not least, Evil Dead, the game on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation

985
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,320
5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

986
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:35,860
All right.

987
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,440
Let's go over to Japan and check out the releases there.

988
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:44,080
So coming out in Japan this week on the Nintendo Switch, Gold Week was this last week.

989
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,920
So now we're getting into releases again.

990
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:50,560
So May 12th, we'll see on Nintendo Switch, the Centennial Case, a Shinjima story is out

991
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,360
this week.

992
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,760
And Dead by Daylight gets a release on Nintendo Switch.

993
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,200
I think that was already out in Japan, but they're getting an Ultimate Edition.

994
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,520
And I was like, well, what's all in the Ultimate Edition?

995
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,200
And I noticed Oni is on the cover.

996
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,480
So OK, that one's there.

997
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:08,640
But then as I look at the list of DLC, there's 13 pieces of DLC, including Portrait of a

998
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:09,760
Murder, which is pretty recent.

999
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,920
That's the artist all included with it.

1000
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,520
So that's pretty impressive.

1001
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:18,640
That's a lot of stuff for basically what is otherwise a standard price Nintendo Switch

1002
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:18,880
game.

1003
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,200
So yeah, pretty interesting deal there.

1004
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:22,720
So that is out in Japan this week.

1005
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,600
Moving over to the PlayStation 5.

1006
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,160
Same thing.

1007
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:31,440
You get Dead by Daylight is also out in Japan on PlayStation 5, as is the Centennial Case.

1008
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,560
Yeah, that's it.

1009
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,160
Let's go over to the UK.

1010
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,440
Do you have that available, Loki?

1011
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,400
Or do I need one?

1012
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,080
Yeah, not a whole lot coming out there.

1013
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:49,200
So we've got Tourist Bus Simulator that's going to be coming out on PlayStation, Evil

1014
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,720
Dead, the game on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

1015
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,800
And let's get fit on the Switch.

1016
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,300
That's it.

1017
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,200
Dark Soccer's pointing out DBD is super huge in Japan.

1018
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:03,600
Yeah, I think it's actually it's been growing in a relatively recently over there.

1019
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:05,600
So that's kind of interesting.

1020
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,520
SG100 Matt says the Evil Dead, the game looks fun, by the way.

1021
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,800
Also very Sam Raimi.

1022
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,240
I'd like to check that game out.

1023
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,400
I'll watch people play it on Twitch and see if it's for me or not.

1024
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,360
So all right.

1025
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,280
We have just a few more stories for you.

1026
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,920
And then we'll invite your calls and your emails.

1027
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,440
I know we have at least one email tonight and whatever else your chat comments in our

1028
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,240
listener roundtable.

1029
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,120
But first, let's get you some more stories.

1030
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,480
Loki, I think you have one for us.

1031
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:38,160
Yeah, Hayden Blackman is apparently leaving Hangar 13 studio, which was the studio that

1032
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:40,080
created Mafia 3.

1033
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:47,440
And, you know, with that, even though he is leaving, they are going to be continuing on

1034
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:53,040
with a new Mafia game that'll be coming out at some point, I guess.

1035
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:53,840
Whenever it's done.

1036
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,280
Whatever it's done.

1037
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:55,920
Yeah.

1038
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,600
So we haven't had a new one of those in a while, right?

1039
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,960
Mafia 3 didn't come out very.

1040
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:03,760
Yeah, it was a while ago.

1041
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,040
It was a while ago at this point.

1042
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:09,120
Yeah, but they're saying, though, that the new Mafia game that was expected to be made

1043
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:13,520
in the Unreal Engine 5 instead of the Mafia 3 engine.

1044
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,640
So, I mean, Unreal 5 looks pretty awesome.

1045
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,080
So cool.

1046
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,360
I can't wait to see that.

1047
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:19,840
Yeah.

1048
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,600
And then I play it because I don't play any of the Mafia.

1049
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,560
Well, let's talk.

1050
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,680
But it will look cool.

1051
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,040
I got this story.

1052
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,960
This next story JB was going to do, but I'll talk about it.

1053
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:34,880
Let's talk about another game nobody is interested in playing, apparently, and that's Babylon's

1054
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:35,520
fall, man.

1055
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,520
The news just gets worse and worse in this game.

1056
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:42,560
I got to admit, I had a curious eye on this game at first because I heard about the Final

1057
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,720
Fantasy 14 assets being used and so forth.

1058
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:50,320
And then I heard about the cash in the cash in the cash, and they were so desperate to

1059
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:55,600
make this a live service game that they could keep cashing in on after that initial $60

1060
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:00,400
fee that, boy, that whole thing really shot him in the foot, even though platinum games

1061
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,320
usually makes platinum titles.

1062
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:02,960
This one.

1063
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:03,200
Wow.

1064
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,680
In fact, a lot of news sites are running with this headline.

1065
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,920
It's down to one concurrent player.

1066
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:11,840
Well, here's the thing.

1067
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:16,880
You know, those concurrent player counts are a snapshot in time, and somebody caught on

1068
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:23,600
Steam charts that there was one player playing it on Wednesday, May 4th, 2022.

1069
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:29,440
So on May the fourth, May the fourth was not with Babylon's fall because one person was

1070
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:29,760
playing it.

1071
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,800
They probably just left their computer on or something in the middle of the night.

1072
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,440
But it's noon somewhere in the world.

1073
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:38,960
So, yeah, that's not a great look for this game.

1074
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:44,640
Of course, we had already talked about a story not that long ago where it was only like a

1075
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,840
thousand people if that were playing it like when the game came out.

1076
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:48,800
So, yike.

1077
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:55,200
And, you know, they kept promising they're going to try to make improvements, but we're

1078
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,000
not seeing them yet.

1079
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,800
But platinum games is saying there is no plans to scale back the development of Babylon's

1080
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,040
fall.

1081
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,800
I think if they want this game to have a chance, they're going to have to fall the price to

1082
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:07,120
free.

1083
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,760
And that's it.

1084
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,680
That's the do or die moment for this game.

1085
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:17,520
Follow the price to free or this game is done and you all are wasting your fucking time.

1086
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:21,520
But that's just my perception on that.

1087
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,320
Loki, I don't know.

1088
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,240
Any interest at all in Babylon's fall?

1089
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:25,760
No, not at all.

1090
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,000
I'd check it out if it was free.

1091
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:29,680
Platinum games is great.

1092
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:30,320
I'd check it out.

1093
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,120
Even do that.

1094
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:31,620
Yeah.

1095
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:32,800
All right.

1096
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,680
They probably have more than one player, that's for sure.

1097
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,160
Loki, what do you got for us next?

1098
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:45,280
I had to check and see what year it was because we're getting reports that Nintendo sports

1099
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,320
fans, it's TV smashing time.

1100
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:54,320
So folks aren't following the concert reminders to put wrist straps on and they're throwing

1101
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:59,360
their Nintendo Switch controllers into the screens.

1102
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:04,480
Joy cons are taking flight and smashing into screens.

1103
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:09,120
What happens if you only have a switch light?

1104
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:12,960
Do you just do you accidentally throw your entire switch because you don't have?

1105
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,600
I don't know if you can play that game on the switch light, to be honest.

1106
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:19,040
I heard it's limited.

1107
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:22,160
Like there's only certain games you can play and it's limited.

1108
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:26,480
I would think you could just get a second pair of independent joy cons and pair them

1109
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,240
to the switch light and play them that way.

1110
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,600
I would think true.

1111
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,080
Yes.

1112
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:33,360
In that case, you'd have to do a combo with that.

1113
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:41,040
You would throw your loose joy cons into the screen, which is exactly.

1114
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:48,800
So it's a little bit more challenging, but if you're up for the challenge, then you

1115
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:49,920
could break everything.

1116
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:52,560
All right.

1117
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:58,080
E3VL in chat says it only works tabletop on single player, cannot play multiplayer.

1118
01:38:59,040 --> 01:38:59,520
All right.

1119
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,400
Lastly, I'm sorry.

1120
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:06,560
I thought this headline was too funny, even though I will fully admit I've never really

1121
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:11,360
played this game, but I've heard the jokes over the years about how Eve online is basically

1122
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,640
a spreadsheet simulator.

1123
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,560
Well, I'll be damned.

1124
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,080
I think this is so funny.

1125
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,480
So there's actually, you know, there's enough people that play this game.

1126
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,040
I haven't played it, but it's still a fairly popular online game.

1127
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:26,720
It's got its fans and they have this Eve fan fest that they do well at the fan fest.

1128
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:33,040
They announced, they reached out to Microsoft and there is now an official extension that

1129
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:39,360
will pull data from Eve online and automatically put it into an Excel spreadsheet.

1130
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:45,440
So an official Microsoft collaboration, a Microsoft Excel add on for Eve online and

1131
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,560
the crowd, as you would expect, went fucking nuts.

1132
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,360
And they were very, cause you know, they're all in on the joke.

1133
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:56,880
So they went nuts and people tweeting, this is the best update that Eve has ever done.

1134
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:05,600
So an early prototype of this was shown and more details are coming out later this year.

1135
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,400
And that's pretty awesome.

1136
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,200
Also, of course, there was more announced a fan fest, not just Excel.

1137
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:14,960
Can you imagine if you went, can you imagine going to Blizzcon?

1138
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:22,480
And the big announcement is now we're, now we're going to work with PowerPoint.

1139
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,120
That's a big announcement.

1140
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:29,920
Of course, that would still be a better year than the year they announced the Diablo mobile

1141
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:30,640
phone game.

1142
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,560
Don't you all have phones?

1143
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,360
Which is finally coming out in June.

1144
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,240
Exciting, right?

1145
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:43,280
And then apparently, I know we didn't talk about it on the show cause we don't talk about

1146
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:46,640
current topics, but I will just say they did announce something else.

1147
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,440
It looks like trash.

1148
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,320
I'm sorry.

1149
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,480
It looks like such trash.

1150
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,040
Yikes.

1151
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:53,520
I'm sorry.

1152
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:53,920
I'm sorry.

1153
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:54,560
I can't help it.

1154
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:55,520
All right.

1155
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:01,040
Anyhow, but Microsoft Excel, I'm all for that kind of collaboration.

1156
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,960
Bobby Black Wolf says CCP has that kind of humor too.

1157
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,000
So it fits.

1158
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:06,500
Yeah.

1159
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:08,580
All right.

1160
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:13,120
Let's move on to, I think that was it for stories.

1161
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:16,400
So now we're ready to talk to our listeners and listen around table.

1162
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:20,160
If you would like to give us a call, you can join our discord server, vog network.com

1163
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:20,960
slash discord.

1164
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,200
That's VOG network.com slash discord.

1165
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:27,120
And if you had to head to the green room, we'll take some of your calls on the show,

1166
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:32,240
but I know we had at least one email because we always invite your emails as well, because

1167
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:37,600
I know people listen to us on the podcast feed available in all your favorite podcast

1168
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,160
apps.

1169
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:41,440
And so some of you will send emails throughout the week.

1170
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:48,320
Sorry, I'm buying time because I'm not logged into the email bag currently, but I know I

1171
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:52,240
saw at least one come in earlier and it's from somebody who actually calls us quite

1172
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:52,740
a bit.

1173
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,040
We have an email tonight from Rama.

1174
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,880
Participate at orange launch, radio.com.

1175
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,960
If you want to send us an email for a future week, Rama writes in and says, greetings,

1176
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:03,920
one and all.

1177
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,520
I hope that the weekend has been eventful for you all a couple of things and I'll be

1178
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,400
on my way.

1179
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:14,640
Number one, is there a game that you started playing that at first you thought was mediocre,

1180
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:17,760
but as you played more of it, you ended up falling in love with the game.

1181
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:22,080
For example, I bought persona five for a friend to play in stream.

1182
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,840
At first, when she started playing, it was all right to her and she wasn't sure that

1183
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,040
she'd continue.

1184
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:33,600
But one year and 300 plus hours later, she ended up loving the game, the lore, the characters,

1185
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:34,400
everything with it.

1186
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:35,840
Yes.

1187
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,280
And I've mentioned this one on the show before, and you're going to say, oh, of course.

1188
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,960
But my answer to this is easy.

1189
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:45,840
Mass Effect would be it because the first time I played Mass Effect, I didn't get it.

1190
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,080
I was just like, oh, this is just shooty, shooty, bang, bang.

1191
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:49,040
I don't think I'm into this.

1192
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,080
Whatever.

1193
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:55,680
This is just, yeah, I don't like RPGs unless they're JRPGs.

1194
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,360
I don't really want to play this anymore.

1195
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:02,800
And then I went back years later to check out the entire trilogy and I fell in love

1196
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,280
with it.

1197
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,360
And I love the original trilogy.

1198
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:09,120
And obviously, as you all know, some of my favorite games that have ever been made.

1199
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:10,320
So that's my easy answer.

1200
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,080
I mean, and I think you all saw it coming.

1201
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,000
Loki, is there one for you?

1202
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,360
I can't think of anything offhand.

1203
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:17,860
Maybe.

1204
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,320
I mean, I don't know.

1205
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:26,160
It wasn't necessarily mediocre, but like I know Minecraft originally, like when it first

1206
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:27,440
came out, I didn't get it.

1207
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:28,160
And you know what?

1208
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:28,800
Me too.

1209
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,800
I didn't play it, but it wasn't that I played it and went, this is all right.

1210
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,120
Once I played, I was like, Oh man, this is awesome.

1211
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,880
So there was never kind of a mediocre point to that.

1212
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,000
But yeah, I can't really think of anything.

1213
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,440
I mean, I'm sure there's something.

1214
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:46,640
The other one that's obvious for me is No Man's Sky.

1215
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:48,720
You know, I never showed up about that game here on the show.

1216
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:50,560
I love that game now.

1217
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:56,320
But the difference there is that, and we all know this, No Man's Sky today in 2021, 17

1218
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,360
patches later, is not the same game that originally was released.

1219
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:04,320
So it's not quite a fair game to use as an answer to that, I think.

1220
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:06,880
Some answers from our chat.

1221
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,120
SH2100 Matt says Undertale for me.

1222
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:11,600
Let's see.

1223
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:17,200
Dark Sakura is still in chat hanging out, saying Mass Effect, Dragon Age 2, and Dead

1224
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,800
by Daylight for me.

1225
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:19,300
Oh yeah.

1226
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:25,920
I'm trying to think if I played Dead by Daylight before Alan started watching all the Twitch

1227
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,000
streamers and I got into it that way.

1228
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,040
I don't think I ever did.

1229
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,640
I didn't even really play it until I watched Alan watching all the Twitch streamers.

1230
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,160
And I was like, all right, I'll try this.

1231
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,680
And then Alan was playing it too.

1232
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:38,800
And I was like, all right, I'll try this.

1233
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,560
And then I turned out I really liked it.

1234
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,320
Dark Sakura says, wow, World of Warcraft as well.

1235
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:48,160
Like for her, it wasn't until Cataclysm that it got good and then it got crap again.

1236
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:48,660
Yeah.

1237
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:51,120
Yeah.

1238
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:54,480
Wow was one of those games like I would kind of go back and forth with too.

1239
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,760
Like I started it, then I went away, then I started again and all that stuff.

1240
01:44:58,720 --> 01:44:59,220
All right.

1241
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:01,680
Back to Rama's email.

1242
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:05,360
Number two, this is a follow-up to my call from two weeks ago.

1243
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:10,240
As of May 2nd, I am no longer a contract employee for the company I work for.

1244
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:14,160
I am now a full-time employee with the benefits the company has to offer.

1245
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:16,240
For that, I'm very thankful and appreciative.

1246
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:20,400
As I said before, being a contract employee can suck because you don't get the full benefits

1247
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:22,240
and discounts the company has to offer.

1248
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:23,760
But if you wait it out, work hard.

1249
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,600
And if you're lucky enough, you'll be in.

1250
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,800
For the record, during my tenure as a contract employee for NBC,

1251
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:33,760
Fresh Direct and a couple other places, I've seen temps quit and go on to greener pastures.

1252
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:38,000
I stayed because I felt appreciated for the work that I did and the pay wasn't bad.

1253
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,080
Take care, stay fabulous, Rama.

1254
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:41,520
Well, congratulations, Rama.

1255
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:43,040
Big hearty congratulations.

1256
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:43,680
You did it.

1257
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,480
You earned it.

1258
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,360
And I can't think of anyone more deserving personally.

1259
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:49,840
So I'm very happy for you, Rama.

1260
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:50,880
Congratulations on that.

1261
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,240
Loki, I think that was the week you were off for your surgery.

1262
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:58,720
But that was the week that the Nintendo thing was in the headline about the contract workers

1263
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:01,760
and all that and how Nintendo was treating contract workers was.

1264
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:02,640
No, I was there.

1265
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:03,120
Oh, were you?

1266
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,040
I can't remember who was here.

1267
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:08,080
Well, yeah, either that or I can listen to it.

1268
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:08,560
I don't remember.

1269
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,040
No, no, it was the week goes out.

1270
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,160
But I was listening to the show.

1271
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:13,440
That's why I remember that.

1272
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,640
So Rama called in and then talked about, oh, I have a unique perspective on this and then

1273
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:19,840
talked about how you know that.

1274
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,760
So that's a lovely follow up.

1275
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:22,720
So congratulations.

1276
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:23,360
It's wonderful.

1277
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,680
So, yeah.

1278
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:26,880
Yay.

1279
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,000
Everybody's giving applause.

1280
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,120
There's clap emojis.

1281
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:29,360
Yay.

1282
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:29,680
Yay.

1283
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:32,320
We're happy for DJ Rama S. Congratulations.

1284
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,040
You did the thing.

1285
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,200
That's it for emails.

1286
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:40,240
If you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1287
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,720
I am looking in the green room.

1288
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:43,680
I don't see anyone.

1289
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:52,080
And DarkSakura wants to clarify she's in chat because she's still her head is fine when

1290
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,760
she's not trying to be on camera.

1291
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:57,680
So like she can like lie down and be on the keyboard and all that stuff or whatever, like

1292
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:58,960
be at a different configuration.

1293
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:03,440
So she's able to let her migraine chill out and chat and not have the focus on.

1294
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:05,040
So we're glad she's still there in chat.

1295
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:08,800
I don't have anything else.

1296
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,720
Do you have any last minute stories, Loki?

1297
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,840
I was trying to find something, but it actually.

1298
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:18,640
Well, I think remember it was Gold Week in Japan, so it actually was a slower Newsweek.

1299
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:21,760
I mean, we still had a show full of stories, but believe it or not,

1300
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,640
I think at this point we're kind of in that whole little waiting period until it's the

1301
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:29,840
quiet before the non E3, the non E3.

1302
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:30,880
But now it's going to be summer.

1303
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:33,280
Why?

1304
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:34,160
Oh, my God.

1305
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:38,240
My watch suddenly was like, here's everything you want to know about E3.

1306
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,240
They're dead, Siri.

1307
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:40,880
They're dead.

1308
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:44,960
Siri came on again and was like, Who's dead?

1309
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,240
Anyway, how about you all in chat?

1310
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:50,000
Do you have any topics you'd like us to discuss?

1311
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,240
You know what?

1312
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:57,120
Whatever is fair game tonight, whatever you want to ask us about is fair game tonight.

1313
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:58,800
Yeah.

1314
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,080
Bobby Black was like, serious.

1315
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:00,720
Like, are you dead?

1316
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:01,520
I will make a call.

1317
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:02,080
No, I'm fine.

1318
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:02,560
I'm alive.

1319
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,760
Dark to see.

1320
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:04,880
It says you got to stop doing that.

1321
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,080
I need to turn.

1322
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:10,800
I never use Siri on the watch.

1323
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:13,920
I'll use it on the phone, especially in my car, because I don't want to use.

1324
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,040
You know, I'm driving.

1325
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,880
I'll say, like, give me directions to so and so.

1326
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:17,760
But that's it.

1327
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:24,240
I also use it a lot to say, set a reminder to do this, because it's so much easier than

1328
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:26,400
going in and trying to actually set it on the calendar.

1329
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:27,840
So there's that.

1330
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:34,320
Bobby Black Wolf says, look at the summer games done quick schedule and see all the

1331
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,120
rhythm games.

1332
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:37,280
Okay, so where are we going?

1333
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:39,040
Games done quick.

1334
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,760
Oh, how about that?

1335
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,200
It's like the first search result there.

1336
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:43,280
Games done quick schedule.

1337
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:46,720
All right, let's take a peek at this and see what we get.

1338
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:48,400
Let's go there.

1339
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:50,400
Let's see.

1340
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:57,280
Oh, I didn't know they already had, like, all of the hosts were assigned stuff.

1341
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:58,240
Gosh.

1342
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,800
Okay, let's see.

1343
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,000
Oh, they're running Mass Effect.

1344
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,640
That's cool.

1345
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:03,920
I okay.

1346
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:04,560
The original.

1347
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,440
I'm seeing.

1348
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:11,440
So they said, look, Bobby says, look, yay, Blaster Master.

1349
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:12,640
Sorry, I'm looking at all these games.

1350
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:14,560
They said, oh, my gosh, so many good ones on the NES.

1351
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:16,640
Let's see.

1352
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:17,680
Where are all the music games?

1353
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,640
I imagine they put them in a big block somewhere.

1354
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:26,640
Oh, they haven't put who's announcing the games, just who's running them.

1355
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:31,520
Because I'm like, I know Bobby and Froob have worked together for, like, five of these now.

1356
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:35,040
I know Bobby's going to do this one unless there's something real wild happens.

1357
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:39,040
So Thursday night is what Bobby says to look at.

1358
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:40,960
Oh, King's Quest five.

1359
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:41,460
Yay.

1360
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:43,280
Let's see.

1361
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:50,480
There's step mania, not itg sound voltex.

1362
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:50,800
Wow.

1363
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,040
That must be more of an expedition type of game.

1364
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:53,840
That's interesting.

1365
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:56,240
That's kind of neat.

1366
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:58,640
Yeah.

1367
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:01,120
Step mania, not itg should be interesting.

1368
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:03,680
A couples exhibition, and that's going to be in person.

1369
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:04,880
Wow.

1370
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,640
Are they doing any mixing?

1371
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:08,400
Copy play time.

1372
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:12,720
Are they doing any mixing of the, like, hybrid stuff?

1373
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:20,720
Like some people had theorized could happen is that they would actually mix the stuff

1374
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,440
like when they needed to do a set change.

1375
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:23,760
Okay.

1376
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:24,000
Yeah.

1377
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,040
Part of these are remote.

1378
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:25,280
Okay.

1379
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,320
That's what I thought.

1380
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,680
See, I think that's a smart thing for Summer Games.

1381
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:35,520
So quick to do is that in awesome games is do when they have a big set change in person

1382
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,120
to run some of the remote stuff.

1383
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:37,680
That's great.

1384
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:39,600
Awesome.

1385
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,000
So that's a good schedule.

1386
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:42,720
That should be fun.

1387
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:45,120
All right.

1388
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:48,080
That, like, you know, I have to check out the VR stuff.

1389
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:52,240
Like, they have a Half Life Alex and super hot VR looks pretty cool.

1390
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,320
Didn't they do a Half Life Alex run last time?

1391
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:54,880
What they did.

1392
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:55,520
Probably.

1393
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:55,920
Yeah.

1394
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:56,480
I don't know.

1395
01:50:56,480 --> 01:51:01,920
I get all their, like, stuff through YouTube, and they do, like, a bunch of different runs

1396
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:05,680
throughout the year outside of Summer Games and awesome games.

1397
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:11,440
Mike Def points out Elden Ring is the closing game this year that tracks because it's new

1398
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:14,480
and it's very popular, especially on the streaming services.

1399
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,360
That's going to be a good one to close with.

1400
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,720
I'm not surprised that at all.

1401
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:23,840
You know, obviously, we're past the days of, like, Metroid being the or Super Metroid always

1402
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,320
being the closer or something along those lines.

1403
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,240
So, yeah, I'm not too surprised with Elden Ring.

1404
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:30,560
It's only so many times you can do Super Metroid.

1405
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:35,520
Well, and then there was the incident that one year and ever since then, you know, they

1406
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,600
started saying, do we have to do this as the closer every time?

1407
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,680
And it turns out the answer is no.

1408
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:45,600
It still is a successful marathon, even when you run other games as the closing game.

1409
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,100
So.

1410
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:47,280
All right.

1411
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:51,760
I do like the randomizer race or, like, the races that they do and, like, randomizer stuff.

1412
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:52,320
Those are fun.

1413
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:54,160
Yeah, I like those two.

1414
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:54,720
Those are fun.

1415
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:56,400
All right.

1416
01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:00,080
Well, that's going to bring us to a close for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

1417
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:03,120
Thank you all so much for tuning into our show tonight.

1418
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,000
We really appreciate it.

1419
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:07,600
If you enjoyed what you heard here, help us spread the word because we are the show where

1420
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:08,880
every gamer has a voice.

1421
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:12,000
But if we don't have the voices here, we can't put them out on air.

1422
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,760
So tell a friend or two about the show.

1423
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:18,720
Share on social media a five star review on iTunes, Spotify or wherever you found this

1424
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:20,560
podcast goes an awful long way.

1425
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,640
We really appreciate all of it for sure.

1426
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,720
And they are doing I'm sorry to interrupt.

1427
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:30,240
They are doing a relay race for Super Mario Maker two.

1428
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:31,520
I'm definitely going to watch that.

1429
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:32,240
It's going to be awesome.

1430
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:32,740
That's awesome.

1431
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:37,700
If you want to join the Discord and continue the conversation throughout the week, vognetwork.com,

1432
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:40,420
that's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1433
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:42,180
We hope to see you there.

1434
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:46,740
In person appearance coming up at Dragon Con again this year.

1435
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:48,180
So check that out.

1436
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:50,740
And there might be something coming up here locally.

1437
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:54,180
I have to talk to you off air about that Loki with Dark Soccer because I got an interesting

1438
01:52:54,180 --> 01:52:54,500
email.

1439
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,580
So message you about that.

1440
01:52:56,580 --> 01:53:01,620
So other than that, that's it.

1441
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:02,580
I don't know what else to say.

1442
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:03,780
It's final thought time.

1443
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:06,180
Loki, do you have a final thought tonight?

1444
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:09,780
I have to check out with this Kaiser Super Metroid run.

1445
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:12,260
It's going to be two because I like Kaiser Mario stuff.

1446
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:15,620
So Kaiser Super Metroid will be insane, I'm sure.

1447
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:16,900
Yeah.

1448
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:19,300
My final thought is I need to get into randomizers.

1449
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:23,700
Like I've always wanted to play a Zelda randomizer or a Metroid randomizer and get into some

1450
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:26,260
of the logic that comes with running those because you have to.

1451
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:29,300
You know, there's a lot of thinking about this before this and this.

1452
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:30,340
I want to get into those.

1453
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:31,860
I've just never really made the time for it.

1454
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:34,340
And I definitely need to make the time for that.

1455
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:36,820
So yes, I will do that.

1456
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:38,660
That's it.

1457
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:40,740
We hope to see you again next week.

1458
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:41,300
We'll be back.

1459
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:44,660
Believe it or not, we're almost on the 20th anniversary end of June.

1460
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:46,900
This show is 20 years old, if you can believe it.

1461
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:51,700
And we have no idea what special thing we're doing yet, because that's how we roll here

1462
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:52,820
at OLR.

1463
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:54,180
Have a wonderful night, everybody.

1464
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:56,100
We'll see you in seven days to do it all again.

1465
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:58,900
And hopefully the gang is able to all get back together next time.

1466
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:04,180
Again, a happy Mother's Day to all the moms and motherly figures out there and gamer mommies.

1467
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:07,140
And I hope you all have a wonderful week.

1468
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:08,260
Take care, everybody.

1469
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:09,140
