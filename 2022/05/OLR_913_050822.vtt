00:00.000 --> 00:13.240
I know I heard about the 24-karat gold-plated Wii made for the Queen of England, but today

00:13.240 --> 00:16.760
I learned that she wasn't allowed to receive it. It's a highly coveted console due literally

00:16.760 --> 00:20.600
to its precious metal, slightly limited playability since Wii's online services have been shut

00:20.600 --> 00:25.040
down, but was otherwise a relic of a successful machine with an ecosystem that is still rich.

00:25.040 --> 00:28.000
Like you would have to be to win the auction for it. Jeez!

00:28.000 --> 00:31.720
This is another sliver of THQ history. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie

00:31.720 --> 00:35.080
Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.160
Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.160 --> 00:44.760
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:44.760 --> 00:51.760
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

00:51.760 --> 00:59.880
number 913 of our show for tonight, May the 8th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and joining

00:59.880 --> 01:02.640
me as he always does say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.640
Hello.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.560
Hey, Loki, how are you?

01:05.560 --> 01:06.560
I'm doing good.

01:06.560 --> 01:10.680
Good. What's new with you?

01:10.680 --> 01:16.520
Not much other than, you know, just Minecraft stuff.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.360
Do we have a new video to look forward to?

01:19.360 --> 01:26.440
Yeah. And having having bad luck with trying to find things to do today because I was trying

01:26.440 --> 01:31.800
to go roller skate or rollerblading again. And like two of the rinks were closed. One

01:31.800 --> 01:36.920
was closed due to some speed skating competition. One just changes their their hours. They're

01:36.920 --> 01:41.280
like, OK, let's go have pizza at this one place. That place was closed because I guess

01:41.280 --> 01:44.960
they were short staffed. They were like, OK, let's go play mini golf. Then it started hailing.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.840
I was like, OK, I'm going home.

01:47.360 --> 01:53.440
Oh, yeah. The weather was very strange today. It was very like, I'm going to be sunny. No,

01:53.440 --> 01:56.560
I'm going to rain. No, I'm good because I was out walking and that was an adventure.

01:56.560 --> 02:02.160
Let me tell you. So I'm also joining us tonight. Say hello to Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.

02:02.960 --> 02:03.560
Hi.

02:03.560 --> 02:07.360
Hi. I wasn't sure if you were going to be here or not. I thought you were going to sit out,

02:07.360 --> 02:08.880
but that's all right. I'm glad to have you.

02:08.880 --> 02:16.320
I was going to, but I figured I'll try. You know, headaches are weird. The moment that

02:16.360 --> 02:20.680
I took off my headset, like it was instant feeling better. So.

02:23.480 --> 02:27.720
I'll push through it. I'm medicated. I have drugs in my body.

02:28.520 --> 02:32.760
Hooray. Always, always nice to have. Well, it's good to have the gang all together. I'm

02:32.760 --> 02:39.000
glad you're here. But if the migraine headache thing becomes too much, just let us know and

02:39.000 --> 02:44.840
we'll continue on the show. We'll continue. I'll be here for for at least the first story.

02:44.880 --> 02:49.520
I just want to, you know, hang out and be with everybody for a little bit. Just, you know,

02:50.080 --> 02:55.040
I missed last week and I don't want to miss too much of this week. I'd rather, you know,

02:55.040 --> 02:58.400
at least, at least spend some time with everybody before I throw in the towel.

02:58.960 --> 03:03.280
Makes sense. Well, great to see you. Sorry to hear you're not feeling well, but

03:03.840 --> 03:07.120
your makeup is great. I know you, I know you need to, if you're going to take the time to

03:07.120 --> 03:12.720
do your makeup, you got to go. You got to show up. I'll tell you what, my makeup is pretty half

03:12.720 --> 03:17.360
fast. I did it in five minutes. All right. And honestly, I'm actually still

03:17.360 --> 03:24.720
wearing my pajamas. I just put on a bra. Well, do you see what you're missing? Not

03:24.720 --> 03:28.160
being here live because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

03:28.160 --> 03:31.520
nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black will show at the voice of geeks network,

03:31.520 --> 03:39.440
twitch.tv slash vog network. And yeah, you can follow us along as we tape live on Sunday nights

03:39.440 --> 03:44.720
and you can participate in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network. But of course,

03:44.720 --> 03:50.320
if you want, you can also listen to our podcast. We're available at places like iTunes, Spotify,

03:50.320 --> 03:54.720
and wherever a fantastic podcast can be found. And there's a lot of love for you in the chat,

03:54.720 --> 04:00.160
dark Sakura, a DJ Rama S in response to you talking about your dressing habits.

04:00.160 --> 04:07.280
Say this is why we stand Jamie go queen. And I'll be perfectly honest. This is also my work

04:07.280 --> 04:12.880
attire when I'm not in the office. Yeah. I think honestly it's, if I don't have to be on zoom,

04:13.600 --> 04:18.880
I'm probably not even wearing a shirt. I've attended many an online training with my big

04:18.880 --> 04:24.560
fuzzy bathrobe and no one bats an eye because we're all doing it.

04:26.560 --> 04:30.160
As she went under, Matt says, you do you Jamie feel better. Absolutely.

04:30.160 --> 04:35.200
I appreciate that. And that's my intention. I just wanted to be on for a little bit, you know,

04:35.200 --> 04:39.120
say hi to everybody before I do a bow out. So, right.

04:39.120 --> 04:45.120
Well, let's get to our kickoff story tonight. It's a big one. In fact, actually this news happened

04:45.120 --> 04:50.400
like right after OLR last week. It was interesting cause it was kind of the middle of the night when

04:50.400 --> 04:56.960
this news broke. But it actually was prime time in Europe. So it was Monday morning in Europe.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.840
So we heard about this at what, like 11 o'clock at night because that's when the workday was

05:01.840 --> 05:05.520
starting over in Europe. Loki, you don't want to get into this big, big acquisition in the

05:05.520 --> 05:12.160
gaming industry, right? Yeah. So the Embracer group is purchasing Crystal Dynamics,

05:13.040 --> 05:19.920
Eidos Montreal and Square Enix Montreal for 300 million, which is actually pretty

05:20.640 --> 05:27.600
cheap considering some of the acquisitions we've had recently. That includes of course several,

05:27.600 --> 05:33.840
you know, big IPs, of course, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, Legacy of Kain and of course

05:33.840 --> 05:39.440
a back catalog of about 50 games. It also takes Avengers with it too, doesn't it?

05:39.440 --> 05:45.440
Sort of. Technically the game is sort of there, but the license is really, and Disney licensed

05:45.440 --> 05:51.040
that to Square Enix. So technically, no, they would have to get permission from Disney to move

05:51.040 --> 05:56.400
that license. They'd have to buy the source code. There's kind of question if it's worth it,

05:56.400 --> 06:01.520
I hate to say, because of the Avengers game not really performing at the level they were hoping.

06:02.560 --> 06:07.200
It's a good game though. Yeah. You know, especially I hear it's in a pretty decent

06:07.200 --> 06:11.040
place at this point from where it was at launch, but it's just one of those things where for

06:11.040 --> 06:15.200
whatever reason, yeah, it just, it didn't get us. Did they also do Guardians of the Galaxy or was

06:15.200 --> 06:20.640
that a different group? No, that was. It wasn't Crystal Deep. It was Eidos.

06:21.600 --> 06:28.080
Yeah. So yeah, they technically get that game, but again, the IP intellectual property is still

06:28.080 --> 06:35.520
Disney's to dole out. I'm more referring to the code. Yeah. So, well, the code for the game,

06:35.520 --> 06:42.080
I guess technically would go to Embracer, but they can't do anything with it besides the game

06:42.080 --> 06:48.960
that's already out unless they go to Disney and renegotiate that basically. Yeah. I'm sure they've

06:48.960 --> 06:53.760
got stuff worked in their contracts and everything, but yeah, Guardians was a great game. I didn't get

06:53.760 --> 06:59.840
to play it cause it won't run through steam on my Mac, but I've watched the entire thing.

07:00.400 --> 07:05.280
Yeah. Guardians seemed to be much better received than Avengers, at least at launch. Cause I think

07:05.280 --> 07:11.120
what's interesting is that the bar was very high for Avengers. It didn't meet that bar well for

07:11.120 --> 07:16.240
many, I should say. And I have, I have no horse in this race. I am not huge on Marvel. Like a lot of

07:16.240 --> 07:21.280
people, I don't hate it by any means. I just it's, it's there and I appreciate it and I, you know,

07:21.280 --> 07:25.200
golf clap it, but I don't, I don't rabidly follow it or anything. I didn't see that new movie that

07:25.200 --> 07:32.560
came out this weekend. I'm afraid to, but because yeah, I've I've it's see most Marvel movies and

07:32.560 --> 07:37.840
they come out. I hear nothing but great things. This one, very polarizing, very polarizing.

07:37.840 --> 07:43.120
The thing is, is that I've, people have just have compared it to drag me to hell, which I hate drag

07:43.120 --> 07:49.840
me to hell with an unholy passion. I love Sam Raimi movies. I hated that one. That was like

07:49.840 --> 07:56.080
one of the last movies I've walked out of just absolutely like, why the fuck did I waste my time?

07:57.360 --> 08:02.160
I'm trying not to make these two movies fight, but I can't help it. I already saw the best

08:02.160 --> 08:05.520
multiverse movie of the year. Cause I saw everything everywhere all at once.

08:05.520 --> 08:11.120
So I want to see that. Well, and my, my other thing is that I'm tired of the trope of

08:11.680 --> 08:17.360
woman in grief with lots of power goes crazy. So just a boring trope.

08:17.360 --> 08:23.120
Um, but anyway, where were we? Oh yes. The bar for Avengers high for many people not met the

08:23.120 --> 08:28.560
bar for guardians low, because when those trailers and things are coming out, people were like,

08:28.560 --> 08:33.680
Oh, I don't know about this one, but exceeded expectations is very kind of interesting thing.

08:33.680 --> 08:37.680
I think I would say that the bar for guardians was set pretty low. People did not have high

08:37.680 --> 08:42.080
expectations for that game. Um, and I don't know if that's like the Chris Pratt drama

08:42.080 --> 08:46.160
carrying over to the game, even though he has nothing to do with the game. Um, but yeah,

08:46.160 --> 08:51.280
it's well, that and star Lord is by in the comics, which is awesome. Yeah. So anyway,

08:51.280 --> 08:56.240
so my point is, yeah, the guardians thing is also worth money. I would think Tomb Raider alone

08:56.240 --> 09:01.520
should have been worth a pretty penny. So embrace her absolutely got to steal. And if you don't

09:01.520 --> 09:06.640
know who embrace her is, they're basically THQ Nordic. It's a little more nuanced than that,

09:06.640 --> 09:09.920
but I'm just going to tell you the short version is their THQ Nordic.

09:09.920 --> 09:14.240
And they've been buying a lot of stuff. I heard a great comparison on Bobby shows.

09:14.240 --> 09:18.720
Of course we tape live after Bobby black Wolf does here at VOG network. He called it the 10 cent of

09:18.720 --> 09:24.000
Europe. And I think that's a very apt comparison, especially in the last couple of years,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.400
THQ Nordics been, you may not realize this cause you might think like THQ or that, well,

09:28.400 --> 09:32.800
okay. Cause this company, they grabbed the THQ name. They they're grabbing this,

09:32.800 --> 09:37.920
they grabbed a gearbox. They got, they've been grabbing a lot of companies when you haven't

09:37.920 --> 09:42.160
been looking. And some of the IPS they have, I mean, they have the goat simulator,

09:42.160 --> 09:46.320
they have time splitters, borderlands, Dark Siders is going to be there. Yeah.

09:46.960 --> 09:52.880
So this is a pretty big holding now. And now, so this, this is the house that is now going to

09:54.720 --> 10:00.880
Tomb Raider and all these other things, which is wild. I cannot believe Square Enix

10:01.760 --> 10:06.880
sold it for as little as they did. Why did Square Enix hate Tomb Raider so much?

10:07.920 --> 10:13.680
Like I, and, and, and the reason why I say that is it all goes back to, we all know that quote

10:13.680 --> 10:17.120
that, you know, the president of Square Enix said that Tomb Raider had,

10:17.120 --> 10:22.480
did not meet expectations, even though it sold like 6 million copies. And I'm sorry,

10:22.480 --> 10:26.880
but the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy was fucking great. Like it was,

10:26.880 --> 10:31.680
those were some good fucking games. And like, Lara Croft and the no good, very bad day.

10:31.680 --> 10:40.400
Yes. Or I like Alan's name for it. Girl. You remember I made that picture a while back.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.040
Yeah, no, that's, that's what my husband Alan calls it. He calls those games.

10:43.600 --> 10:49.280
Girl. That's cause that's what it is. She, she hits a tree branch. Girl. She dodges lightning

10:49.280 --> 10:55.360
bolts. Girl. That's what it is. She falls down a hole into a sewer. Girl. Yeah.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.280
TigerClawn chat says Square Enix has unrealistic expectations.

11:00.400 --> 11:05.360
Fifth Dream in chat says, notice it's all their Western games, but all the J stuff is still at

11:05.360 --> 11:11.680
Square Enix. Yes. That is also interesting. If we want to talk about unrealistic expectations,

11:11.680 --> 11:16.480
they think they're going to make money with NFTs. I mean, there's some unrealistic expectations.

11:16.480 --> 11:23.040
And now there's that quote going around is that we, we had to sell these so that we could invest

11:23.040 --> 11:32.640
in the blockchain, which I hope they lose everything. Gaming companies. I don't want

11:32.640 --> 11:38.160
them to lose everything. I need my final fantasy series. My father has a 14, my father has a 16

11:38.160 --> 11:43.360
Yoshi P. I need to put him in a bubble. He's a precious angel. I in for the gaming industry,

11:43.360 --> 11:49.200
I need those people protected. I don't want Square Enix to fail. Absolutely not. So I, but I,

11:49.200 --> 11:55.200
I need this NFT thing to them to back off this whole thing. Because again, I don't be,

11:55.200 --> 11:57.680
and I was talking about this a little bit on Bobby's show. I'll say it again.

11:58.400 --> 12:04.560
I view NFTs very similar to the Diablo three real money auction house. And I know that there are

12:04.560 --> 12:09.200
going to be nerds out there that want to correct me saying, well, actually with the difference

12:09.200 --> 12:15.120
between NFTs, would that be NFTs are not centralized and Blizzard ultimately owned

12:15.120 --> 12:20.480
everything that was through the Diablo three auction house. Okay. Yes, I get it.

12:21.120 --> 12:26.400
But here's the thing. A lot of people out there don't understand NFTs. And when they think of

12:26.400 --> 12:31.040
NFTs right now, they see those ugly fucking monkeys that are like the bit, what are they,

12:31.040 --> 12:36.080
what is that? The yacht, eight club or whatever those are. They are ugly. They are more to come

12:36.080 --> 12:41.520
on that ugly fucking monkeys riddled with crime. That is what NFTs are right now.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.960
So if you want this to break into the mainstream,

12:45.840 --> 12:50.800
you've got to convince people what are the, you know, benefits to this.

12:51.600 --> 12:57.680
And I understand that a lot of it, or why I understand that a lot of it to me feels like

12:58.320 --> 13:04.560
amiibo. And yes, I understand amiibos are not unique in nature, but you can load unique things

13:04.560 --> 13:10.160
to them and amiibo. And this is why I say Nintendo is going to be the one that pushes NFTs and gets

13:10.160 --> 13:15.120
it right. Because amiibo, the reason why it works is well, A, the figures are nice, B,

13:15.760 --> 13:21.280
they work in multiple games. And that's, you know, these things, you know, if you can buy content

13:21.280 --> 13:26.160
that really truly works in multiple games, I think it's going to be great. But I think Nintendo is the

13:26.160 --> 13:30.320
only company that's got it all in one roof where people are going to eat it up. I don't think

13:30.320 --> 13:35.840
Square Enix, I mean, maybe with the Final Fantasy franchise, but I don't, God, I don't want them to

13:35.840 --> 13:43.760
see him. It just doesn't make sense for the Final Fantasy franchise. So Bobby Blackwell, to be fair,

13:43.760 --> 13:49.040
saying NFTs technically do not have to be unique. They are just intended to be philosophically.

13:49.040 --> 13:55.920
Look, here's the thing. I, on one hand, I kind of get where the NFT technology is going. A

13:55.920 --> 14:02.240
decentralized Diablo 3 auction house where let's say the swords you get can actually work in all

14:02.240 --> 14:08.240
these other games, too. I kind of get that. I just don't see that realistically working in

14:08.240 --> 14:14.000
our industry for a long time. And I think it's way too early to get into it when right now,

14:14.000 --> 14:19.680
when people hear NFT, they think of fucking crime, they think of spammers, they think of crime,

14:19.680 --> 14:24.080
they think of things to delete and send instantly to the trashcan, because that's what it is on the

14:24.080 --> 14:28.960
internet right now. And if you're a crypto bro, I'm sorry, I'm telling it like it is.

14:29.600 --> 14:34.720
That is what most people, maybe your bubble doesn't view it that way. But most people out

14:34.720 --> 14:42.400
there don't get it. And I'm sorry, but those ugly fucking art pieces of art are not going to sell

14:42.400 --> 14:49.920
it to them. So that's that's my weekly NFT rant. So anyway, so I don't understand why Square Enix

14:49.920 --> 14:56.960
thinks that they've got to get in this right now. I really don't. S2100 Matt says to get on the

14:56.960 --> 15:02.240
ground floor. S2100 Matt says many hardcore NFT folk understand that at some point the market

15:02.240 --> 15:06.560
will drop out. And all of these monkey and other stuff will be worth noting. It's all about cashing

15:06.560 --> 15:11.120
in now. Bobby Blackwell says Square Enix's president says you are in the majority opinion,

15:11.120 --> 15:17.760
but you will change your mind soon. And Bobby, I'm willing to admit, I may change my mind.

15:18.640 --> 15:22.400
And this has been shocking. But you know what's going to do it? It's not going to be a fucking

15:22.400 --> 15:27.520
ugly ass random, randomly clothed monkey. It's not going to be that. You know what's going to

15:27.520 --> 15:34.720
do it? Pokemon. That's when we're going to get into NFTs. And I know right now you don't want

15:34.720 --> 15:39.120
to hear me say it. You don't want to hear me even open up that realm of possibility. But that's I'm

15:39.120 --> 15:44.720
I I will bet money. Nintendo is the only one that's going to make it happen. And when they

15:44.720 --> 15:53.040
make it happen, it happens. So that's that's my opinion. Bobby Blackwell says yes, the goal for

15:53.040 --> 15:57.600
NFT people is for them not to be the last person holding the bag when the market crashes. That's

15:57.600 --> 16:02.880
why they really, really want you to get into it so they can sell you their NFTs. Hence the crime,

16:02.880 --> 16:07.600
the spam, and the no fucking thanks that goes along with all of that right now.

16:08.400 --> 16:17.280
So anyhow, the thing is, is that they need to actually get the true pulse of

16:19.360 --> 16:26.320
the people. You can't create, and I'm saying create and quote fingers, you can't create

16:26.320 --> 16:34.160
something, put it out there. And if people don't want it, you can't force it on them. They're not

16:34.160 --> 16:44.320
going to, to take something that's forced on them. I mean, and we know the the loudness of

16:44.320 --> 16:52.560
our of our community, right? We know the forcefulness when people do not want, right?

16:54.480 --> 17:00.240
And we've we've seen what internet campaigns can do. I mean, a lot of people like, oh, that

17:00.720 --> 17:06.880
does jack shit. But in truth, major changes have happened because of it,

17:07.920 --> 17:14.480
because of really upset people on the internet. And that's what they're, they're not remembering,

17:14.480 --> 17:22.560
especially and I mean, a lot of the Japanese companies, the successful ones look outside

17:22.560 --> 17:30.240
of Japan. They look at the world pulse on it. They look at where the trends are worldwide,

17:30.240 --> 17:39.600
because and not not to be like, oh, America, blah, blah, blah, but really a lot of the world

17:39.600 --> 17:46.320
changes. I mean, we are a big country with a lot of people. You know, that you have to do a

17:46.400 --> 17:54.800
comparison between what's going on in Japan and America and Europe and find the commonalities.

17:55.920 --> 18:00.160
And they're not doing that. They're saying, Oh, no, we think that this is going to be the

18:00.160 --> 18:05.200
big thing. And we're going to make this happen. And it's not, it's not going to happen. They're

18:05.200 --> 18:09.760
going to lose money on this one. And they're going to say, why the hell did we sell Tomb Raider?

18:09.760 --> 18:18.800
In five years, 2027, Nintendo is going to launch Nintendo fun tickets. And with Nintendo fun

18:18.800 --> 18:24.800
tickets, you can make a design, and you can sell it and it can be an Animal Crossing shirt. And

18:24.800 --> 18:29.600
it's also going to be a design that's on your Pokeballs in your inventory. And it's also going

18:29.600 --> 18:34.320
to be something that you can use in the background in Mario maker. And it's also something that sits

18:34.400 --> 18:39.520
in your Smash Brothers trophy collection. And when Nintendo fun tickets happen,

18:40.480 --> 18:45.760
that's when it'll finally happen. But don't I Nintendo is going to do it.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.280
They'll be last to the party for sure. But I'm just

18:49.280 --> 18:52.240
But Nintendo has always been very conservative.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.080
Nice. Very true. Yes, yes. But that's why I said when they finally get to the party,

18:56.080 --> 19:00.800
that's when it's, you know, happening. So but and I don't think Nintendo is going to

19:00.800 --> 19:07.760
go to the party, I think Nintendo, as is their way, they're going to have a completely different

19:07.760 --> 19:13.840
party, and it's going to have the success and everyone's going to go, why the hell did we not

19:13.840 --> 19:19.920
do that? It's like, because Nintendo looks outside the box, and they do have their, you know, I like

19:19.920 --> 19:27.920
to say that Nintendo has that ability to look around the corner. You know what I mean? To take

19:27.920 --> 19:34.320
a true peek around the corners, where people are just looking in the straight line, they're

19:34.320 --> 19:39.120
looking at the wall, they're looking at the path around the wall, you know, straight ahead of them.

19:39.120 --> 19:44.720
But Nintendo is looking around to see, well, what's going to come in? I mean, we've always

19:44.720 --> 19:50.960
thought them to be very conservative in their approach to technology. You know, they've all

19:50.960 --> 19:57.840
like, while their systems haven't been the most powerful in comparison, they've had the most

19:58.400 --> 20:07.040
fun, in my opinion, just in general, their games focus on fun, their peripherals focus on fun,

20:07.040 --> 20:14.000
they focus on things that are enjoyable. And if they're not going to go the route of the NFT,

20:14.960 --> 20:23.280
for for those same reasons that you know, it's it may not be the fun that consumers are looking for.

20:23.280 --> 20:29.760
It's just money in the pocket. And we've even seen, they've been willing to take a hit financially,

20:30.320 --> 20:36.400
to put out something that's going to be more fun. And in the end, it usually pays off for them. I'm

20:36.400 --> 20:40.880
not counting the Wii U, you know, Reggie, and this is another reason why I'm saying even though yes,

20:40.880 --> 20:45.200
I know Nintendo is conservative everything. This is one of the reasons I am well, there's two

20:45.200 --> 20:50.960
reasons why I'm saying Nintendo with this because number one, I strongly believe Nintendo is the

20:50.960 --> 20:56.720
only gaming company I can think of save for maybe Sony and Microsoft first party stuff. But I think

20:56.720 --> 21:02.160
Nintendo is stronger than both of those even. Nintendo is the only company with a first party

21:02.160 --> 21:08.320
ecosystem strong enough to support the vision we're being promised of NFTs. I don't think any

21:08.320 --> 21:13.760
other company out there has the ecosystem of insular titles to support that system is not

21:13.760 --> 21:19.520
Square Enix, not after just selling off three of their, you know, big properties, but I digress.

21:19.520 --> 21:24.800
The other reason why I bring it up, Reggie's out there right now doing a big book promotional tour,

21:24.800 --> 21:30.160
and he's doing a lot of interviews to support the book. I understand Reggie has not represented

21:30.160 --> 21:36.160
Nintendo for several years now. However, he's been out there saying, Yeah, I think blockchain,

21:36.160 --> 21:39.760
I think blockchain is the future of the industry. I think I think, you know, we're not there yet.

21:39.760 --> 21:43.440
But I think that's something we're getting towards. Here's the thing. I really I know.

21:43.440 --> 21:47.360
Yes, Reggie has nothing to do with Nintendo anymore. He's not speak for them. I get it.

21:49.280 --> 21:53.760
But was he speaking about it a couple years ago? Was this something that intended because you know,

21:53.760 --> 21:57.440
these these companies they're looking they're looking far forward. Was it something that

21:57.440 --> 22:00.880
maybe they would, you know, he still has friends, he still has people he's talking to.

22:00.880 --> 22:08.080
I'm not I just think Nintendo, they know about it, whether they're going to embrace it or not,

22:08.080 --> 22:15.520
they certainly know about it. I think that they're going to have their own variant of the thing.

22:16.160 --> 22:24.000
Yeah. Like I said, tickets now. Maybe not like that. But like, and I'll tell you,

22:24.000 --> 22:27.440
I actually ordered a game on play Asia today and they take crypto.

22:28.160 --> 22:28.660
Hmm.

22:29.360 --> 22:36.960
Um, I think that the concept is going to evolve into something more stable.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.920
Not this decentralized thing. But

22:44.720 --> 22:50.320
it's it, I think it's going to be some sort of hybrid, something that can be tracked,

22:50.400 --> 22:58.000
something that can be regulated, but still allow a level of anonymity and personal control.

22:58.800 --> 23:03.040
You know, something like, you know, like in the movies, like in the future, oh,

23:03.040 --> 23:09.680
we pay X credits for something right. You know, where it's not physical money anymore.

23:10.400 --> 23:17.360
I think we're going to be down the line going to something like that, if that makes sense.

23:17.360 --> 23:23.120
And I think that we'll have a lot more digital property down the line,

23:24.400 --> 23:30.560
but I don't think it's going to be exactly the way that the NFT thing is going to be.

23:31.280 --> 23:37.120
And I actually agree with fifth dream in here, decentralization, which is touted as

23:37.120 --> 23:41.120
it's great feature is the whole reason people get getting ripped off.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.080
Yes. I just looked at that comment too. I was like, yep, that's it.

23:44.160 --> 23:49.120
If you never do it, I'll tell you why they won't ever do it. Because Nintendo can't stand when

23:49.120 --> 23:57.120
their property decreases in value. And NFTs are going to decrease in value, they will never touch

23:57.120 --> 24:02.800
it. No, they they I don't think that's the case because they know that their amiibo are going to

24:02.800 --> 24:08.880
eventually decrease except for those ones that are like misprints or limited prints. Those might be a

24:08.880 --> 24:13.840
different case. And I agree with Jamie in the sense that I don't think Nintendo would allow it

24:13.840 --> 24:17.520
to be completely decentralized. I think it'll be the illusion of decentralized.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.400
Yeah, I think there's going to be and well, and I also want to point out if you look at history,

24:26.400 --> 24:31.280
right? You know, I'm going to go actually back to something I've brought up before

24:31.280 --> 24:38.400
the whole labor reform in the US. Remember, those industries were basically privatized,

24:38.400 --> 24:45.280
decentralized. owners had control over how the companies work and what happened to their

24:45.280 --> 24:52.960
employees, what happened to their investors, you know, eventually, they had to be regulated

24:52.960 --> 24:59.680
for the safety and well being of, of the people in general of society in general. And that's

24:59.680 --> 25:04.880
actually I think, before too long, we're gonna start seeing legislation to start regulating

25:04.880 --> 25:08.400
crypto. Oh, it's it's already happening. Absolutely. I know it's already happening.

25:08.400 --> 25:14.800
But but history has been a teacher about what happens when there is no central regulation on

25:14.800 --> 25:21.040
an industry. All right. I don't know how we got from the Square Enix stuff to NFT in depth

25:21.040 --> 25:27.840
discussion, but it's a good one. So I mean, basically, the whole reason of the the sale

25:27.840 --> 25:35.840
was for their NFT market. And I think it's an apt transition is and I think this is something

25:35.840 --> 25:41.520
we have to look at because we're hearing it from all angles. This is where the executives want

25:41.520 --> 25:46.080
this industry to go. And this is one of the things I we have to look at it whether we like it or not

25:46.080 --> 25:51.840
and try to weigh like, what parts of it will work and what parts of it won't work. And I think now

25:51.840 --> 25:56.320
for there's a lot that won't work. What do you want to say that they're just trend hopping?

25:57.120 --> 26:02.000
They're trend hopping. They're trend hopping. They don't know anything. A lot of these companies

26:02.000 --> 26:05.360
have jumped on. They're like, oh, blockchain, blockchain, blockchain. It's like, okay,

26:05.360 --> 26:10.880
well, how are you gonna use it? Blockchain, I mean, like, they don't even know what it is.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.840
Like, for example, the company I work for is like, super, they're like,

26:13.840 --> 26:15.840
blockchain is the future. Like, how are you gonna use it?

26:17.280 --> 26:25.040
Yeah, I don't know. I'm like, Bobby, shut up. Remember when VR was the future or 3d TV?

26:25.920 --> 26:32.480
I do remember when VR was the future in 1996, when the lawnmower man came out, that was VR.

26:32.480 --> 26:40.240
Isn't it interesting that it probably took a good what probably 15 years, probably more 15,

26:40.240 --> 26:48.080
17 years after that hole. But when VR is the future, it took 15 to 17 years for where now we

26:48.080 --> 26:56.960
have HTC Vive, Oculus, PlayStation VR, and VR is finally catching on a lot more. And in many ways,

26:56.960 --> 27:00.960
it's still pretty fresh points to it's still pretty high in many ways.

27:00.960 --> 27:06.080
When the price point comes down to where it's affordable, then it'll catch on more right now

27:06.080 --> 27:10.320
the price to get into it is too high. But it's coming down.

27:10.320 --> 27:15.040
I think at the point that it though becomes mass affordable, no one's gonna care. It won't be

27:15.920 --> 27:18.240
the cool elite thing anymore.

27:19.760 --> 27:24.240
But it'll be a different type of way of interacting with things. And it all it also

27:24.240 --> 27:29.600
depends on like, how to utilize it. Once again, you have Facebook, I'm not calling a meta,

27:29.600 --> 27:34.240
you have Facebook trying to like, come up with this like metaverse thing. It's like,

27:34.240 --> 27:40.080
okay, well, what's that gonna be for? I don't know. I just want to do it. So we changed our

27:40.080 --> 27:43.440
company into meta. It's like, it's stupid. It's like, you don't know why you're doing it.

27:43.520 --> 27:50.640
They're doing it to get away from monetization. They're also doing it for their reputation

27:50.640 --> 27:55.680
with all those studies that went on about how they're harming LGBTQIA youth, which is one of

27:55.680 --> 28:02.640
the big reasons why I quit using Facebook. It's, they're trying to rebrand themselves.

28:02.640 --> 28:09.360
That's part of it. But you know, there's a lot of good discussion here in in chat. I mean,

28:09.360 --> 28:15.680
Rama brings up a good one. If you follow economic history, he said, I remember when trading foreign

28:15.680 --> 28:20.480
currencies was the big thing. I remember, you know, studying back in the 50s, when people

28:20.480 --> 28:25.920
wanted to invest in gold bullion, you know, when everyone's like, Oh, invest in gold. It's the

28:25.920 --> 28:33.920
thing. You know, it what we're dealing with is a very, I'm going to say mature topic that the

28:33.920 --> 28:39.920
younger gamer community isn't necessarily going to be too understanding of. But those of us who

28:39.920 --> 28:45.360
have studied history, those of us who are old enough to understand economics, at least to

28:46.560 --> 28:53.040
a decent extent, just because we've seen it and been exposed to it, we can compare where our

28:53.040 --> 29:01.280
gaming industry is crossing over with economy and compare those histories together, we can see those

29:01.280 --> 29:09.840
trends. The thing is, is that I call this executive insanity. That the moment that you

29:09.840 --> 29:17.760
go to the executive level, you're so focused on company goal that you stopped seeing the big

29:17.760 --> 29:22.880
picture. That's the only company in this industry bolded under you just you just said the biggest

29:22.880 --> 29:28.240
problem in the gaming industry. The thing is, is that the companies that are going to be successful,

29:28.240 --> 29:35.760
I'm going to even expand this into into tech, in general. I work in the tech industry. So

29:36.480 --> 29:42.800
I'm going to leave it at that. But the best companies in general, just in general companies

29:42.800 --> 29:48.160
and in general, are the ones who can see around the corners. They're the ones who can see the big

29:48.160 --> 29:54.000
picture instead of looking in a straight line. They're going to pull in their analysts from

29:54.000 --> 29:57.920
outside sources. They're going to pull in people from diverse backgrounds.

29:58.800 --> 30:03.200
And they're going to have the people who say, well, this worked in this industry,

30:03.200 --> 30:08.960
this worked in this. I see the parallels here. Why don't we incorporate something new and different

30:09.600 --> 30:14.800
and look at this a different way instead of just doing what everybody the fuck else is doing?

30:14.800 --> 30:20.240
And that's that's exactly why I think Microsoft, especially in the past five years, specifically

30:20.240 --> 30:25.200
the Xbox division is in a place and they're in a great place. And they are a much different

30:25.200 --> 30:28.480
company than the one we started talking about 20 years ago when the show started.

30:28.480 --> 30:31.840
I think micro because the guy at the top of Microsoft is a gamer who gets it.

30:32.560 --> 30:38.480
Also hire me. All right. I'm a really good consultant. I pay attention to shit. I may

30:38.480 --> 30:41.760
not have the background in it, but I pay attention to shit and you need me.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.280
All right. Well, Dark Soccer, before you go prepare your resume, why don't we get into the

30:45.280 --> 30:49.360
next segment about how was your gaming week and what are the types of games that you have been

30:49.360 --> 30:54.320
playing this week? So Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week? I played some Dead by Daylight.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.360
I played badly because I just, I honestly was just like bullshitting around,

31:01.360 --> 31:06.000
you know, trying different builds. I have a very nasty doctor build right now,

31:06.000 --> 31:13.760
which is called Fuck Your Gens. Oh, it includes, what did they change mindbreaker to? Fearmonger?

31:13.760 --> 31:22.000
Oh, no. Fearmonger. Yeah. Yeah. It's the scourge hook one that causes your gens to pop.

31:22.560 --> 31:26.320
Pain Resonance. Yeah. Yeah. Pain, not Pain Resonance. Is it?

31:26.320 --> 31:35.200
Yeah. Pain Resonance. It was, it was the Onryo one. Yeah. So, and then it was Merciless Storm,

31:36.000 --> 31:39.680
which when your gen is close to being done, you get continuous skill checks.

31:40.000 --> 31:47.280
And, um, yeah, it's what, whatever, what was Jolt before Surge? Yeah, something like that.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.240
They just changed it from one caffeinated soda to the other.

31:51.920 --> 31:58.080
And then I play doctor. I saw it on doctor. I saw a nasty build that combined that Onryo perk,

31:58.080 --> 32:04.960
the, um, the 90% Merciless Storm, it combined that with, um, the Huntress's skill check one.

32:05.680 --> 32:11.680
That was, that was disgusting. Yeah. I don't have that unlocked on doctor yet,

32:11.680 --> 32:18.240
cause I'm still working on getting everybody prestige. Um, I'm close to having Legion on their

32:18.240 --> 32:26.080
next prestige level and the changes for Legion. Oh, they're godly. I mean, I played like a potato,

32:26.080 --> 32:31.920
but I still had fun because like mixing the, their mix tapes. Yeah. The chase music is so good now.

32:32.720 --> 32:38.880
Like, I love it. Also, did you hear that they're, um, they're taking ghost,

32:38.880 --> 32:42.000
they're changing ghost faces music because everyone hates it.

32:43.520 --> 32:47.360
And there's the, the leak, the D the DBD leak right now.

32:48.480 --> 32:52.800
Apparently the next killer and survivor have leaked because they accidentally put it on the

32:52.800 --> 33:00.000
public test realm. And so somebody got it. And on top of that, there also is information out

33:00.000 --> 33:06.160
that they're doing an expanded secondary resident evil chapter. And so who's the new,

33:06.160 --> 33:13.600
that is going to bring in, uh, Ada long, Rebecca, um, Ada long and Rebecca chambers as a survivor

33:13.600 --> 33:18.880
and Wesker as a killer. I knew it had to be Wesker. That's Oh, I didn't hear that. That's

33:18.880 --> 33:23.920
supposed to be chapter 25. That sounds like fanfic, but at the same time, God, do I want

33:23.920 --> 33:29.920
that? I would love to play from DBD leaks and from the same person that leaked the dredge stuff.

33:30.400 --> 33:36.720
Wow. And then chapter 26 is supposed to be an unknown survivor and a killer called the night.

33:38.960 --> 33:44.400
That's in can, you know, like really should have, it should have been night, man.

33:45.280 --> 33:51.120
Well, the dredge is the, the, the one that leaked for this upcoming chapter is, uh, is, uh,

33:51.120 --> 33:56.240
N I G H T powered thing. Like his whole thing is putting the survivors in total darkness and

33:56.240 --> 34:02.000
basically, uh, transporting around the map and lockers so that a survivor can open the locker

34:02.000 --> 34:07.520
and the killers inside it. And that does sound pretty awesome actually. And on that PT, we miss,

34:07.520 --> 34:13.680
we miss the joke. I was saying that you should have night night, man, and then Charlie. Yeah.

34:13.680 --> 34:20.800
Okay. All right. Sorry. I'm slow to the party. They also on the PTB, there are new, uh,

34:20.800 --> 34:26.720
RuPaul's drag station. I'm sorry. RuPaul's police station, Raccoon city. Um, that will have map

34:26.720 --> 34:33.600
variants the way Badham does. Interesting. Changing the layout of like, and I'm looking

34:33.600 --> 34:39.920
at the picture. It's all like covered in the goo and littered and there's like new assets listed

34:39.920 --> 34:45.680
on it just means I should have downloaded. I usually keep updating the PTB so I can get the

34:45.680 --> 34:50.320
assets from it. That's actually how I have ripped everything from Hawkins while it was still in the

34:50.320 --> 35:01.920
game. Um, but there's also, um, just all kinds of stuff in there. Um, and DBD leaks has been

35:01.920 --> 35:08.400
very reliable. There's been a few times they've been off base, but they've been reliable about

35:08.400 --> 35:13.520
it. You know what I mean? Um, can I say S2100 Matt in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says,

35:13.520 --> 35:20.400
so no Baba Duke. Um, no, but pride month is next month. And so, you know, we, we already got the

35:20.400 --> 35:26.480
whole like, Hey, guess what? David's gay. And here's the progress pride flag. Uh, introducing

35:26.480 --> 35:31.120
the Baba Duke as a killer would be a great pride month announcement, but I just, I don't think it's

35:31.120 --> 35:37.600
happening. Sorry to say. And I actually watched a really good interview where they said at behavior

35:37.600 --> 35:47.360
that they work on something like another six to 10 chapters in advance where they buy the IPs and

35:47.360 --> 35:54.640
start their work on it and incorporate feedback from the community. And so, I mean, and you see

35:54.640 --> 35:58.080
how well they work with some of the bigger streamers with the community. And I didn't mean

35:58.080 --> 36:03.280
to turn my, my gaming week into dead by daylight news, but this is pretty big stuff. Yeah. No,

36:03.280 --> 36:07.120
if you're into dead by daylight. And I just want to say, I mean, like, even though the Baba Duke

36:07.120 --> 36:12.000
might be gay rights, like nothing would scream gay rights in dead by daylight, like adding

36:12.000 --> 36:16.240
Toni Collette from Hereditary as a character. So I'm just I'm just saying that because Toni

36:16.240 --> 36:23.760
Collette is gay rights. Just saying. The thing is, is that like, how would would

36:23.760 --> 36:28.960
it would killer be her son? She she'd be both a survivor and a killer.

36:28.960 --> 36:39.200
Well, there's also another thing going out. This is a rumor mind. Okay. But you know how

36:39.200 --> 36:45.040
when Legion was supposed to come out, they were supposed to be like, their original intent was

36:45.040 --> 36:53.040
to be a survivor disguise. Where you didn't know that they were the killer. And of course, that

36:53.040 --> 37:03.520
didn't work. Which is VHS's whole thing. Yeah, yeah. But the but the other thing, though, is

37:03.520 --> 37:13.920
that there's rumor about having like a shape shifting killer that can disguise as one of the

37:13.920 --> 37:21.600
survivors in game. Interesting. I think it would be an interesting mechanic. But it's still like

37:21.600 --> 37:26.960
vague rumor at this point. All right. So other games I've played. Yes, yes.

37:26.960 --> 37:31.360
I beat Seiken Densetsu 3. Oh, congrats. I was watching your stream the other night. You were

37:31.360 --> 37:35.440
you were stuck on this part for a bit. You were getting really frustrated.

37:35.440 --> 37:44.240
Yeah, it was. It was the mana, the mana sanctuary. It's got some they changed the path the pathing

37:44.240 --> 37:50.800
to get back to the mana tree for when the mana tree is dead. Sorry, spoiler for a 25 year old

37:50.800 --> 37:59.040
game. But um, but I got to it. I beat the game. I did screen caps at the ending. It was it was

37:59.040 --> 38:06.320
perfect. But I do have the poll up because I said I'm always going to do it in a poll even though

38:06.320 --> 38:14.880
I'm positive that Terra Enigma is going to win. It's in the lead right now. But there's like two

38:14.880 --> 38:20.000
more days left on the voting. And I'll put up I'll put it in in our chat.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.640
I was gonna say I have not seen your tweet but I was I was hosting a show last night. So

38:24.640 --> 38:28.560
I missed a lot of Twitter stuff. But I'm there's two days left on it.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.880
I'm going to vote in your poll right now for Terra Enigma.

38:31.840 --> 38:40.080
Yeah, so um, here, I'll go ahead and just paste it in chat. But at any rate, um, the then that

38:40.080 --> 38:45.680
means the game after that I'm going to do is is BS Zelda, the stone tablet legend.

38:48.080 --> 38:48.960
That's a deep dive.

38:48.960 --> 38:56.880
So I have the thing for I've also played because I've been trying to get Saturn games that I own

38:56.880 --> 39:06.080
to run on my Mac. And so I played the dome patch for Sega Saturn. And I played some radiant

39:06.080 --> 39:14.320
Silver Gun. And I played X-Men Children of the Atom. Nice. So I've been getting my Saturn on.

39:16.880 --> 39:21.520
I keep forgetting how hard the dome patch is because I mean, it is a cave game,

39:21.520 --> 39:26.400
but I keep forgetting just because I like the dome patch when it starts off, you know.

39:29.680 --> 39:35.120
That's it. I'm still looking for a Hikaru emulator that will play Planet Harrier.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.240
Let's go to Loki and your gaming week.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.520
Uh, it's all been Minecraft, as usual.

39:43.360 --> 39:45.760
No magic pen gel like your background.

39:45.760 --> 39:50.080
No, no. Sadly, I don't have a PlayStation 2 emulator on my,

39:50.080 --> 39:56.800
my PC. Although I mean, I'm sure that'll run like crazy. I did get my Xbox Series X back.

39:56.800 --> 40:00.000
So I'm hopefully gonna hook that up and build play something with it.

40:00.560 --> 40:07.680
Um, what is it? I played more of my hardcore series this week, so I made good progress in

40:07.680 --> 40:13.200
that. Once again, recording too much footage for one episode. I had a struggle to get it down to

40:13.200 --> 40:18.480
just the 35 minutes that it was with that, which isn't disappointing because I had a really good

40:18.480 --> 40:24.640
ending that I wanted to put in there. But I had like another four hours of footage to cram in

40:24.640 --> 40:30.720
there. So it's gonna have to be two episodes. Um, but yeah, I, I ended up going to, well,

40:30.720 --> 40:35.440
it'll be in the next episode. I went to the Nether and then immediately left the Nether because it

40:35.440 --> 40:42.800
was a horrible place. And I don't want to go there because I'm playing with, you know, um, the 119,

40:42.800 --> 40:51.760
um, skulk stuff everywhere. So in it, um, you set off these things that cause like darkness.

40:51.760 --> 40:57.440
It's almost like blindness in the game. And so like, as soon as I stepped through the portal,

40:57.440 --> 41:00.960
like it was still loading in the world and stuff, there's a gas shooting me.

41:01.760 --> 41:06.960
The darkness effect went off twice, which means as soon as I like moved one more time,

41:06.960 --> 41:12.160
the warden would spawn. And then I still had a gas. It shot the portal, broke the portal.

41:12.720 --> 41:17.760
And so I had to relight the portal real quickly and get back through. I was on fire at the same

41:17.760 --> 41:23.280
time. And then I got out and my mind, this isn't a hardcore world. So like I was two and a half

41:23.280 --> 41:29.200
hearts away from dying. Um, I don't know how I managed to survive, but I did. And I have it all

41:29.200 --> 41:37.040
on, all on, uh, film basically. So that'll be the, the end possibly to the next episode or,

41:37.040 --> 41:39.680
you know, somewhere in the middle. I haven't decided yet. I have to see how much footage I

41:39.680 --> 41:45.360
have. If I have enough for a full another episode again, but, um, yeah, it was intense. And also

41:45.360 --> 41:50.160
because I updated my world from the first experimental snapshot that they put out

41:50.160 --> 41:55.280
to the new one, the new one, I mean, obviously they're beta snapshots. They're not done yet.

41:55.280 --> 42:02.560
Um, the warden doesn't work quite right because he is spawning in daylight and he's not supposed

42:02.560 --> 42:07.520
to do that. And so it made it incredibly dangerous now because before it used to be, okay, well,

42:07.520 --> 42:10.880
just don't get caught out in the dark and you can kind of go wherever you want and do stuff.

42:10.880 --> 42:15.120
Just be careful of the caves and that type of thing. Now it's like, you're dead everywhere you

42:15.120 --> 42:23.840
go. You're just in constant danger. So, um, that was a bit fun to demonstrate, but it made good

42:23.840 --> 42:28.400
progress in it and having a lot of fun with it. It's just, I had to be careful because I play it

42:28.400 --> 42:33.360
a lot cause it's fun. But then I ended up with like so much footage. Like the last time I played

42:33.360 --> 42:37.040
it, for example, was the first three episodes that I put out because there was some more work

42:37.680 --> 42:42.640
cause I, cause I had so much footage to go through and it's fine. This is what brings in the views.

42:42.640 --> 42:47.920
I got my, my channels up to 370 subscribers now and you know, there's tons of people that come

42:47.920 --> 42:52.320
in for that series. So I'm obviously going to keep putting it out, but right now, you know,

42:52.320 --> 42:57.760
I've been working on stuff for nerd craft for the next episode. So, um, you know,

42:57.760 --> 43:02.880
kind of balanced between those. All right. Uh, my gaming week, honestly, so I was,

43:02.880 --> 43:05.920
I had a show last night, so I haven't been gaming a lot this weekend. Um,

43:05.920 --> 43:10.960
but as mostly final fantasy 14, um, I wanted to do some streaming this week. I didn't get around

43:10.960 --> 43:15.360
to it because honestly, like I was kind of sick this week. Like I just, yeah, I won't get into

43:15.360 --> 43:21.280
not like, um, cough sick, but like stomach sick. Um, so, uh, yeah, it just really put me in a

43:21.280 --> 43:24.480
bad mood and I didn't really want to stream, uh, at all this week, but it pretty much just

43:24.480 --> 43:29.520
play more fancy 14. Like I got my Sage to level 90, so I've maxed another job at 90.

43:29.520 --> 43:33.360
Uh, and I'm working on dancer now trying to get that up. So just pretty much my,

43:33.360 --> 43:36.800
uh, MMO crack is pretty much all I still play. And then of course,

43:36.800 --> 43:43.520
lots of AR games, uh, as long as you're not a dancer in the dark. No, I'm not, uh, Pokemon go

43:43.520 --> 43:49.360
and ingress and Pikmin. And today I forgot they were doing like a event day in Pikmin today. It's

43:49.360 --> 43:53.760
all about carne. It's not technically community day, but it's like, because it's mother's day.

43:53.760 --> 43:57.200
So, you know, happy mother's day to all the moms and motherly figures out there.

43:57.200 --> 44:05.440
Um, so, uh, it's carnations, uh, where are the big thing in the game right now? So yeah, so I'll

44:05.440 --> 44:09.920
get around to some other games this week. I actually want to try guardians, the galaxy for

44:09.920 --> 44:15.120
sure. At some point I still have tunic that like came out almost a month ago that I keep meaning

44:15.120 --> 44:18.240
to get into. Cause everybody tells me it's like old school, Zelda, which like one of my favorites.

44:18.240 --> 44:24.400
And I got to get into that. Yeah. So I just, you know, too many games, never enough time

44:24.400 --> 44:29.520
or when there is time, it's always just MMO crack or I guess I did play a little bit of dead by day

44:29.520 --> 44:34.720
life. Only a little bit only. I had some really crappy games and I was like, forget it, forget it.

44:35.680 --> 44:42.080
All right. Hey, before I forget what I've got a community thing going on right now, where if,

44:42.080 --> 44:46.240
uh, and I'll keep it up until I get the points for it, but I will play a swift.

44:47.920 --> 44:50.720
I thought, did I donate points for that? I hope I did. I think I did.

44:51.440 --> 44:57.200
It's it's fine, but I might do it a little bit earlier. We'll see. But at this point I am going

44:57.200 --> 45:04.080
to go ahead and say goodnight. I'll be in the chat, but my headset's hurting my head. So.

45:04.080 --> 45:10.240
All right. Feel better. Thank you. I, and I'm, I'm also not going to stream tonight. So

45:10.960 --> 45:17.520
of course, so everyone, as I tell people when I end my own streams, be kind to yourself,

45:17.520 --> 45:22.000
be kind to others and go forth and conquer. Sounds good. We'll try our best. All right.

45:22.000 --> 45:27.840
Have a good night. All right. Well, we will get into the news at this point. So let's get into

45:27.840 --> 45:34.080
our top headline for tonight. Uh, Loki. Yeah. So let's talk more about how Activision sucks

45:34.080 --> 45:43.200
and is being sued by more people. So there's been a complaint filed in Delaware, um, asking to see

45:43.200 --> 45:49.840
the, uh, financials of Activision Blizzard and also New York city is now suing Activision

45:49.840 --> 45:59.680
Blizzard as well. Um, apparently this is because of the, they're saying, uh, was it the fair?

46:00.240 --> 46:04.400
It kind of goes along with, I think with the fair employment and housing, um, suit that they had,

46:05.120 --> 46:13.200
but, um, this is so long, basically, uh, I think just trying to, with the announced merger,

46:13.200 --> 46:18.240
they said, uh, their Kotick will be able to escape liability and accountability entirely

46:18.240 --> 46:22.960
and will instead continue to serve in his executive. Um, when the, after the merger

46:22.960 --> 46:28.480
closes, um, worse, despite his potential liability for breaches, for fine, uh,

46:28.480 --> 46:36.240
financial, uh, duty, the company's board will allow or allowed Kotick himself to negotiate

46:36.240 --> 46:41.040
the transaction with Microsoft. The board's decision to entrust Kotick with the negotiation

46:41.040 --> 46:46.720
process is inexcusable. And for the additional reason that Kotick stands to personally receive

46:46.720 --> 46:52.000
substantial material benefits, whose value is not directly aligned with the mergers price.

46:52.000 --> 46:57.600
Basically they're finally in the suit because they're, he is going to make out like a bandit

46:57.600 --> 47:03.360
in this whole merger thing. If it goes through and people are not happy with that concern,

47:03.360 --> 47:11.040
he is kind of good job, New York city, because fuck Bobby Kotick. He should not get a goddamn

47:11.040 --> 47:15.680
thing from what he's done to that company. He's already taken too much. He should pay him back

47:15.680 --> 47:20.800
to be quite honest. We know that's never going to happen. So good job, New York city. Get her Jade.

47:20.800 --> 47:29.440
That's what I say. I it's yeah. I, I mean, I, I'm not opposed to Microsoft buying Activision

47:29.440 --> 47:34.000
blizzard because I know it eventually we'll get Bobby Kotick out of the picture and it'll be in

47:34.000 --> 47:39.440
a better place. So this is not an anti-Microsoft cheer. This is 100% an anti Bobby Kotick and no,

47:39.440 --> 47:46.560
he shouldn't get a goddamn thing chair. So, um, also deejiram says, this is why you don't fuck

47:46.560 --> 47:50.960
with NYC. Well, I thought this was a very similar thing too. I think there were some states that

47:50.960 --> 47:56.800
were looking into this and essentially it's because governments invest in companies, um,

47:56.800 --> 48:02.960
because a lot of their, um, financial holdings like pension plans, basically pensions for city

48:02.960 --> 48:07.040
employees in New York city, as well as state employees in place like California, you know,

48:07.040 --> 48:12.560
you name it, these pension plans, investing companies to stay financially sound, to be

48:12.560 --> 48:19.040
able to pay out these pensions later, when these companies do dumb things, like promising a payout

48:19.040 --> 48:24.640
to an executive who doesn't fucking deserve it. Some of these cities and States look at it as

48:24.640 --> 48:30.160
that's money that essentially could be in our pensions, not directly, but it's, it's money

48:30.160 --> 48:34.800
that the company is paying out that they shouldn't have to, and it damages the value of the company.

48:34.800 --> 48:38.880
So that's why essentially they, at least we know we've had some States that have done that

48:38.880 --> 48:45.120
previously. So, um, yeah, bonds 006 says New York state attorney general. She is on her game.

48:45.120 --> 48:55.440
Yes. So props, honestly. Um, so I, I'm glad, I'm glad that Bobby Kotick starting to feel the heat

48:55.440 --> 48:59.280
a little more because that board sure as fuck didn't hold him accountable. And it's really

48:59.280 --> 49:04.400
annoying because that, that board over at Activision blizzard is just as guilty as he is

49:05.120 --> 49:11.520
far as I'm concerned. Get rid of them all, get rid of them all, take them out back and

49:12.640 --> 49:15.440
buy them tea. Cause I wouldn't say anything else on this show.

49:17.360 --> 49:21.120
I am tea and then tell them to leave. All right, let's move on.

49:23.120 --> 49:26.880
All right. Let's talk about, I got it. We got, let's talk about summer games Fest.

49:26.880 --> 49:31.440
So summer game Fest is, uh, I would say games cause there's more than one game,

49:31.440 --> 49:37.280
but it is called summer game Fest. Anyway, summer game Fest live will be kicking off on

49:37.280 --> 49:43.520
June 9th, 2022 at two o'clock Easterns. That's 11 o'clock West coast time, our time.

49:43.520 --> 49:48.000
And, uh, this is going to be a big, uh, you know, this is the big Jeff Keeley show where

49:48.000 --> 49:52.320
there'll be a multitude of different game studios unveiling. Uh, this whole

49:52.320 --> 49:56.720
embrace or thing we were talking about earlier in the show, THQ Nordic, they don't do their own

49:56.720 --> 50:03.040
press event. So this is a great place to see some of that as an example. Um, and many other places

50:03.040 --> 50:08.240
throughout the industry as well. What I think is interesting about this, this is when E3 would

50:08.240 --> 50:13.600
have been, this is exactly when E3 would have been. Well, yeah, they probably originally timed it to

50:13.600 --> 50:20.640
be around when E3 was supposed to be. Yes, because the digital E3 year, which was last year, it was

50:20.640 --> 50:28.400
also timed right around the E3 stuff. So that part I'm, you know, uh, but yeah, uh, it is

50:28.400 --> 50:36.560
interesting how I think after E3 kind of said, not this year and Jeff Keeley is, you can see

50:37.440 --> 50:43.680
he wants it. He's foaming at the, he wants control of that. And honestly, speaking of,

50:43.680 --> 50:47.840
I mean, we're just going across the realm of incompetent people in the industry tonight

50:47.840 --> 50:52.160
and the ESA right up there, I mean, right up there with them. So, you know,

50:54.720 --> 50:58.160
they're going to send us another email this year saying, Hey, we leaked all your information. Hey,

50:58.160 --> 51:01.520
we know there wasn't even E3s here. That's why we're stepping up our game to leak your

51:01.520 --> 51:07.920
information all year that we're not even having E3. So we are a tech organization representing

51:07.920 --> 51:15.440
the entire industry and we don't have security. We're a very fluid company and all those leaks

51:15.440 --> 51:20.800
just flow out of our company and all that data so that everybody can see it. We believe in

51:20.800 --> 51:26.480
transparency, but our Alexa rankings that we judge websites and media corporations on our Alexa

51:26.480 --> 51:36.720
rankings are secure and trustworthy. Anyway. Oh, where were we? Oh yes. Uh, world premiere.

51:36.720 --> 51:44.320
Jeff's favorite phrase in the world. World premiere. World premiere. World premiere.

51:45.200 --> 51:49.920
That's going to be all over Summer Games Fest, uh, trailers, news updates for games as well.

51:49.920 --> 51:54.480
Cause I'm sure you want to know the latest and wait for that same throw delay. Oh, well I'm

51:54.480 --> 51:57.920
when updates I'm saying you want to hear the latest and greatest for like death stranding

51:57.920 --> 52:04.960
and you know what Kojima is next. Ooh, do you think? Cause Jeff Keeley is absolutely in bed

52:04.960 --> 52:10.640
metaphorically with Hideo Kojima. Do you think Kojima's next title, which is rumored to be the

52:10.720 --> 52:17.440
scary game, whether it's silent Hill or not, do you think Summer Game Fest, that should be the

52:18.320 --> 52:24.160
scary game cause he represents the scary game. Yeah. Why not? I like games just saying what they

52:24.160 --> 52:28.320
are like, let's, let's just put it out there. You know what game this is the scary game.

52:29.120 --> 52:34.160
So that would be fun. Also, what I think is interesting with this,

52:34.960 --> 52:41.920
you will be able to watch this in IMAX theaters. So you can stream it in the comfort of your own

52:41.920 --> 52:50.880
home for free, or you can go catch COVID at your local IMAX theater. Hopefully it's not that

52:50.880 --> 52:55.120
dramatic, but why, why would I, why would you go to the theater when you could just watch it? Oh,

52:55.120 --> 52:59.280
I don't know. There, there is something to be said about IMAX and seeing something on a big screen,

52:59.280 --> 53:05.840
you know, that whole presentation. Um, for example, last night we were doing the lost boys

53:05.840 --> 53:10.240
from the eighties on the big screen and now, and I I'd never gotten to see that movie on the big

53:10.240 --> 53:15.520
screen. So getting to see that on the big screen, I was like, Oh, this is kind of fun. So anyway,

53:16.640 --> 53:23.440
uh, various IMAX locations in the U S Canada and the UK, uh, probably nothing near us though,

53:23.440 --> 53:26.800
Loki, unless we want to go to the Metreon in San Francisco, I'm going to just guess.

53:26.800 --> 53:30.400
That's not true. They've had it in the past when they've done like the PlayStation stuff.

53:30.400 --> 53:36.400
They've been at most of the IMAX is because it's just a, um, they just beam it in, you know, just,

53:36.400 --> 53:41.200
it's a satellite feed that they basically just, you know, probably not even a satellite at this

53:41.200 --> 53:49.040
point, just internet feed that they just stream in. Uh, let's see, Bobby, Bobby Blackwell says,

53:49.040 --> 53:53.600
Jeff should take it to the next level and give out awards at summer game Fest. I mean, why not?

53:53.600 --> 53:59.360
Why not? Why not do a more community based award show with some of those things he wants to do?

53:59.360 --> 54:04.480
Why not do that show in the summer and then the industry show in the winter? Like you're joking,

54:04.480 --> 54:09.440
but like, actually there could be a lot of good stuff by splitting that up a little bit.

54:10.160 --> 54:15.200
Anyway. All right. Uh, let's move on to our next story. You want to take this one, Loki?

54:15.760 --> 54:19.200
Yeah. I think this is fun. I've been sent this article a lot this week.

54:19.600 --> 54:24.960
The, uh, the video games hall of fame has announced their new inductees for this year.

54:24.960 --> 54:29.520
And it's very exciting because it's a lot of games that are near and dear to our heart.

54:29.520 --> 54:36.880
For example, we've got, uh, the legend of Zelda Ocarina of time, Sid Meier's civilization.

54:37.680 --> 54:41.040
Literally my all litter, literally my all-time favorite PC game,

54:41.600 --> 54:43.040
literally my all-time favorite PC game.

54:43.680 --> 54:48.080
Very, uh, Ms. Pac-man, which I like how it's represented by a TV plug and play thing.

54:48.400 --> 54:52.560
Uh, that's hilarious. The machine was a little large for the picture.

54:53.280 --> 54:59.680
Yeah. And then of course, dance dance revolution. It's getting it's due finally.

55:00.880 --> 55:04.240
Which, um, of course I think most people out there know the history of this show,

55:04.240 --> 55:10.640
but if you don't, uh, orange L'Andrea started 20 years ago because Loki dark soccer and myself

55:10.640 --> 55:15.360
all met at a local arcade playing dance dance revolution. And for the first two,

55:15.360 --> 55:19.440
three years of our show, if you think dark soccer talks a lot about dead by daylight,

55:19.440 --> 55:22.560
you should see how much we talked about DDR for years, years.

55:23.200 --> 55:26.960
And then finally Konami kind of like stopped release. There's, there's a whole other thing

55:26.960 --> 55:31.920
I could get into about how Konami of Japan were idiots. And they want to take risk of releasing

55:31.920 --> 55:38.240
new DDR games out here. And it's only because of one person at Konami over here that we ever got

55:38.240 --> 55:43.440
it in the U S but anyway, I digress. Uh, we just went so long without content.

55:43.440 --> 55:46.720
It was like, well, I guess we should talk about other video games too, cause there's no new DDR,

55:47.600 --> 55:52.000
but it's really exciting to see DDR getting its due. And you know what it's had the effect that

55:52.000 --> 55:56.400
it sat on the gaming industry. Cause if you think about it, you know, it's much more than that

55:56.400 --> 56:02.560
machine that's bopping cheesy Eurodance tunes, but DDR made its way into school gymnasiums.

56:03.120 --> 56:06.480
Like we have to remember people of a certain age, like you and I Loki,

56:07.680 --> 56:11.920
when it was the winter time and physical education, we used to do square dancing,

56:11.920 --> 56:16.160
right? I don't know about your school, but that was the thing is like during the rainy season,

56:16.160 --> 56:20.080
we do square dancing inside the gym. Cause we couldn't go outside and play cause it was raining

56:20.080 --> 56:25.520
all the time. Was that what they did at your school too? Um, yes, we did square. I think

56:25.520 --> 56:32.960
they did square dancing and then like, um, I think there was other types of dancing that

56:32.960 --> 56:38.320
they did as well. Like, I don't know if they did like salsa ballroom, like maybe salsa or

56:38.320 --> 56:43.360
something. It was other, other types. It wasn't just square dancing, but yes, I remember square

56:43.360 --> 56:47.120
dancing. But, but with the point I'm getting to, and I think y'all know where I'm going with this,

56:47.120 --> 56:53.680
is that now for kids today, there's a lot of schools where winter phys ed is that DDR school

56:53.680 --> 57:00.720
edition where like you do dance, dance revolution as a class. And now that, which is mind blowing

57:00.720 --> 57:06.480
to me, that's, that's where we're at now. So DDR, you know, became a much bigger thing. It became

57:06.480 --> 57:10.400
like a physical ed thing. And, you know, obviously DDR is still in the industry. We know there's

57:10.400 --> 57:14.720
DDR ACE and, you know, in the arcade and you know, those, those are still coming out. I still,

57:15.280 --> 57:21.280
you know, in the, that you a Bamani loyalist to this day, I love you. And you are going to hate

57:21.280 --> 57:27.840
me for saying this. That's still a very niche thing. And it's only niche because Konami doesn't

57:27.840 --> 57:33.040
care about home entertainment anymore. Um, and doesn't care and releasing peripherals and

57:33.040 --> 57:38.160
releasing any of that in the home. So it's, it, you have to go to a round one or a Dave and

57:38.160 --> 57:44.080
busters to find that stuff. And people just don't go there every day, you know? So, um,

57:44.080 --> 57:48.720
still waiting with bitty breath for our, our round one to open up at some point,

57:48.720 --> 57:55.040
a theaters open, um, early June was last I heard. Yeah. Keep them pushed back. I know

57:55.040 --> 58:02.800
technically spring. So anyway, but, but DDR has had a lasting impact beyond just the machine,

58:02.800 --> 58:07.440
you know, you, me and dark soccer all played years and years ago and the multiple mixes as

58:07.440 --> 58:13.440
a result of that, like DDR became physical education activity, like, you know, teaching tool,

58:13.440 --> 58:18.640
uh, in that regard. So, um, I, it absolutely earned its place in the hall of fame for sure,

58:18.640 --> 58:24.560
but it's also wild to think about that game came out originally in 1998,

58:24.560 --> 58:33.440
this show 20 years old started about DDR. Yep. Oh, you know, it's funny.

58:34.480 --> 58:38.560
Uh, just announced tonight on the show prior to us, Bobby black Wolf,

58:38.560 --> 58:42.480
Bobby black Wolf is going to be doing announcing again for summer games done quick, which is

58:42.480 --> 58:46.720
awesome. Congratulations, Bobby. Nice. But it's the first time he's doing it in person because

58:46.720 --> 58:50.400
summer games done quick is good. Or, you know, that's extremely exciting. That's yeah. It's

58:50.400 --> 58:54.320
going to be in person again. So he gets to go out to Minneapolis for an entire week to do it.

58:54.880 --> 59:00.800
Well, because of when it's time to guess what he's not going to be here, June 26,

59:01.520 --> 59:06.240
my birthday and the same night that happens to be pretty much, Oh, technically the birthday

59:06.240 --> 59:11.200
is on June 23rd, but the 26 will be the closest show to that day. So he's going to miss our will,

59:11.200 --> 59:16.080
ours 20th anniversary. Luckily we all love games done quick here and think it's an

59:16.080 --> 59:21.120
outstandingly worthy cause. So I'm not that pressed about it. I get it, but I just think

59:21.120 --> 59:30.080
it's funny. So all right. Anyhow, let's move on something, something not as funny. Well,

59:30.080 --> 59:35.680
it depends on your sense of humor. Maybe it is funny. Yeah. So, uh, the Prince of Persia remake

59:35.680 --> 59:43.520
is having some issues. So it's been delayed quite a bit. Um, they originally estimated to come out,

59:43.520 --> 59:50.720
uh, January, 2021. And I didn't even remember that it was supposed to come out then.

59:50.720 --> 59:58.000
And right now it's changing studios again. So, uh, um, yeah, they put out a, uh,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.360
the Prince of Persia, Twitter put out an update on development of Prince of Persia,

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:08.320
the sands of time remake. And of course they went over, uh, what was going on there.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.560
It says the development of Prince of Persia, sands of time remake will now be led by Ubisoft

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:19.200
Montreal. Uh, the decision is important, um, important step and the team building upon the

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:26.800
work that she's by, uh, Ubisoft, uh, was it Pune? I don't really understand how they pronounce that

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:32.640
and Ubisoft, uh, Mumbai, and now they will take the time. They need to regroup and on the scope

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:39.120
of the game and deliver you the best experience. Um, so yeah, it's going to take more time.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:48.560
I honestly forgot to be honest. I don't know. I forgot it was coming out too. I just assume

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:53.760
it had come out and nobody noticed or something like that. I mean, that's, that's neat. I guess

01:00:53.760 --> 01:01:00.320
that they're still working on it. I mean, all right, cool. What are we going to do?

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.720
Uh, yeah, maybe I'll check it out when it actually comes out. If it's serviceable. I mean,

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.080
it sounds like the game has a lot of issues, but maybe, you know, at least they're taking the time

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.640
to fix them and they're not releasing a product that's broken. So there is that, um, as 200

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.920
Matt and Chad says, I forgot this was being worked on. I wouldn't be shocked if it's canned

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.480
at some point. Well, they're sticking to it for some reason. They're sticking to it. Like they're

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:29.040
sticking to, uh, that beyond good and evil sequel, right? Oh God. Speaking about things I forgot

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:34.720
about. That's right. That was supposed to be a thing, wasn't it? All right. Yeah. That was

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:41.520
announced way before Prince of Persia. So, you know, yeah. All right. You know, you know, no,

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:48.640
but you know what sequel we're going to get a lot sooner than that. Um, more of them not denouncing

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:53.680
all of this sexual harassment and, uh, bigotry that's going on in their company. We're getting

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.480
plenty of sequels for that where they just don't denounce that. So look forward to that very soon.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:04.240
Maybe a trailer, a world exclusive trailer at summer games fast. Ouch, because it's true.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.480
All right. Moving on to the next topic. I don't know why we're talking about roadblocks,

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:17.520
but we are because it's the biggest game in the world. We have one. I just don't really follow,

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.160
but yes, you're right. I know, I know. And it's, you know, they're making their own stuff in there.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:28.560
Yeah, exactly. Well, now another company that is teaming up with Roblox is Spotify. So yes,

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.680
there is a new space in Roblox called Spotify island, where you can create music, chill in a

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:40.000
virtual venue and get exclusive virtual merchandise. And it's out now. Uh, it looks very green, just

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.200
like the Spotify logo. Uh, there's icons that are consistent with the apps and so forth. You can

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:51.760
also collect like icons for free merch. Uh, also, uh, artists will have the chance to connect with

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:56.160
fans as a way to earn money. A portion of the sales will go to artists, other than not saying

01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:01.520
how much that is and what acts are really being collaborated with, but there's supposedly that's

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:07.120
in process. You know, we're available on Spotify as a podcast. Where's our island. Are we on

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.080
Spotify island? That's what I need to know. Can you listen to OLR on Spotify island?

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.600
I don't know. Or can you only listen to Joe Rogan because

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.680
that's the kids need to connect with Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. So

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:28.400
anyway, sorry, I had a hairball. Um, apparently the virtual world is full of Easter eggs. You

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:34.400
can find along the way. Uh, also you can do music and sounds with a beat maker station.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:40.640
It's powered by soundtrack. Spotify bought them in 2017. So if you want to see what they used it

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:46.080
for, there you go. The first themed experience will be debuting in a few weeks. It's called

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:53.200
K park and it's all about K-pop. So you can interact with stray kids and soon me, uh, and

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:59.440
that won't be the last. So I can't wait for all the K-pop stands to just fly. That's the name

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.400
of abandoned, not just actual stray kids. So you wouldn't necessarily want to enter.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:14.880
Well, all right. Let's see. Uh, bonds 006 says upon hearing this news, looks at Sony and home

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:20.080
and Sony music and the other labels they have. Yeah. Right. Like Sony could have had this.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:25.200
They're late to the party. I mean, honestly, like this is basically like this and what they're

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:30.560
doing like in Fortnite kind of is more metaverse than the metaverse stuff. I mean, honestly,

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:34.000
I mean, this is what they kind of wanted is this whole thing where they can have spaces that

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:39.280
you can create and interact with different things and monetize the crap out of it. And so

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:45.120
here we are. I mean, Sony was doing that with home. I mean, they probably would if they,

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:49.120
you know, they could have had a Spotify place that you could have gone and visited in home.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.920
If they had thought to involve K-pop, because I'll tell you what, K-pop stands

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.560
are the scariest stands on the internet and they're, they're going to flock to it.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:04.640
As 200 Matt says, K-pop stands will break the network. A hundred percent. A hundred percent.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:15.600
Let's move on to our next story. Uh, yes. So apparently NFT is still bad. Um,

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:22.080
there's folks that are fans, I guess, of the bored ape yacht club who are trying to buy

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:28.640
video game land. This is with the other deed collection where they can basically claim land

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:36.800
in, I guess, a space called the, uh, other side. And they say it's a play to earn gaming project

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:44.320
that's supported by their new crypto token, ape coin. Cause of course they have to have a token

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:49.760
on top of their NFTs and stuff. Cause why not? Um, definitely not going to be a rug pull because

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:57.040
that's not what any of these are ever. Um, but apparently though there's, um, other side was

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:05.040
intended to launch in April, but hasn't, um, really come out yet. And based on that, there's been,

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:13.600
you know, basically this is a big scam, I guess. Um, yeah. The other, other deed sale,

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:19.520
they said, uh, which launched at the end of April, uh, which includes, uh, Yuga labs,

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.400
which is the company, I guess the largest NFT mint in history. I think they're the ones behind

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:32.000
the bored ape yacht club. And, um, yeah, apparently they've had an issue with a lot of

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.880
failed transactions. They said due to the incredible demand being forced through the

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:43.200
Ethereum's bottleneck, uh, for those affected, we appreciate your willingness to build alongside us.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:52.960
Um, but know that we've got your back on refunding your gas. So apparently what's happening,

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.840
I think is that they're paying money to buy these tokens, but the transaction's failing,

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:00.320
but they're not getting their money back type of thing.

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.560
And I don't want to just repeat the conversation we had earlier in the show,

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:11.120
but as long as this is representative of what NFTs are, they are never period bolded,

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:17.440
underlined, italicized. I will own that comment. They will never be successful. As long as this is

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:22.240
what's representing NFT, these games that they're coming up with to like force NFT to happen,

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:27.360
force fetch to happen in these games, not going to happen, kids, not going to happen.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.200
You got to figure out a way to make it work with something that already exists out there.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.400
Yeah. So the other thing too is, uh, earlier this week, actually on the fourth, they,

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:42.560
the yugolabs had announced that they'd refunded everyone's gas fees, um, that everyone that had,

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:48.160
uh, failed transactions. However, um, lots of folks still haven't received a refund.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:55.040
And on top of that, there's also someone created a fake other side website that conned some of the

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:02.720
NFT holders out of more NFTs. Again, losing $6.2 million worth of NFTs. Once again, it's like,

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:08.400
when you ever hear an NFT story, it's always either a rug pull scam or someone's dealing them

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:15.840
via like some sort of, um, you know, malware or just, you know, your old school

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:24.080
kind of a phishing scam to try to get that kind of stuff. So I don't know.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:30.880
What a fucking mess. That's all we have to say. Next up, next topic.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:38.880
Yeah. So, uh, of course, you know, with a lot of these big acquisitions, you know,

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:45.120
there are going to be some new regulatory bodies looking into them. So the FTC is actually

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:51.360
investigating Sony's proposed bungee acquisition. Uh, they're saying that it's, you know,

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:57.360
they're looking to, um, make sure that I guess it's not going to be more, I don't really know,

01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.080
like anti-competitive. I'm surprised they're looking at that and not necessarily the Activision

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:06.880
Blizzard one. Cause I think that the bungee one is much smaller scale than Activision Blizzard,

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.800
but I haven't heard that they're looking into that, but I would assume that they

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.840
should if they aren't already. Um, so yeah, I think that's pretty par for the course though,

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:21.600
that they would look into, you know, acquisitions like that, but we'll see if that might give their

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.840
blessing or not. I don't think this is as big of a deal as like the gaming media. I mean, it's a,

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:30.880
it's a, it's a clickbait headline in this case. I really don't think this is, of course, they're

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.480
going to investigate it with this big of a tree. Is it like you just said, it's, it's such a huge

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.920
transaction that of course they're going to investigate it. Um, and I don't, I don't think

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:44.240
this should be concerning it. This is there's, I feel like what gaming journalism in some ways is

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:50.320
trying to do is like, try to equate this to the Microsoft Blizzard merger and all the problems

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:55.360
that are going on there. This, that is apples to oranges people. Right. And I don't think that

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:59.920
they've necessarily done that yet. And speaking of Microsoft, I mean, they did investigate the,

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:07.600
um, acquisition of Bethesda back when they did that in, uh, was that 2021? Right. So I mean,

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.440
it's not like unheard of that they do this. And I would imagine that the same thing is going to

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.240
happen with the Activision acquisition, although we don't know, like that's probably still later

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:24.560
on down the line. Like they haven't really merged yet or like, or I don't think they're at that

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.960
point where they're investigated yet. Um, maybe because of all the crazy stuff going on with

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.240
Activision, but, um, I'm sure it will happen. I'm sure they'll look at it. They're not going

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:37.840
to be like, Oh, we're going to investigate this $3 billion one, but the other one,

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:46.000
the $70 billion one, that one's cool. All right. Well, let's move on to our next story

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.120
and talk about this. This is interesting. So, um, Fortnite is now available on X cloud gaming,

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:59.360
which is X boxes, X boxes powered, um, or, you know, Microsoft's, uh, cloud service. Right.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:06.240
But what's interesting about this is that this is basically created a way now to play Fortnite

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:13.680
on an iPhone again, because Apple, what's that? I said, check me Apple. I'll get to that. I'll

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.360
get to that. So Epic games basically is now made, you know, Fortnite available on iPhone again,

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.360
because of the X cloud partnership, because you can just, you can do X cloud on the web,

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:28.480
even on a mobile device. So you can do that. So of course, Tim Sweeney goes and writes a tweet

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:34.640
and says, well, Fortnite's now available without the Apple tax. I'm summarizing that tweet. I

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.320
don't remember the exact tweet, but he's basically trying to say now you can do Fortnite and there's

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:45.040
no Apple tax, but I'm looking at that going. What about the Microsoft tax? Because it's still

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:53.440
running on X cloud. And as far as I know, Microsoft Sony, they all charge 30% as well.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:57.840
Now, maybe the difference is it has to do that whole thing where Apple was very mad about the

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:04.240
back door and all that stuff. And, uh, they didn't want to have, um, uh, a way to, uh, you know,

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:10.320
buy them on the web and maybe Microsoft is allowing that, I guess. Um, but yeah, so this is,

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:19.040
uh, this is interesting how that's happened. So, um, but yeah, so Fortnite's now available to play

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:26.560
on all those devices if you want, but technically the headline is Fortnite is now on Xbox cloud

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:32.960
gaming. It just has this interesting side effect of now Tim Sweeney is hyping it up as,

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:41.760
Oh, we're back on this. So it's interesting. So, all right. So now this is the part of the

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.480
show where things are going to get very interesting here, but I'll explain here in

01:12:46.480 --> 01:13:01.520
a minute because we have a segment to do. So let's roll the bumper. And now it's time to travel back

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:07.520
to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:18.960
It's time for the classic game of the week. So here's the problem. Dark soccer had picked a game.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.000
I don't know anything about it. And I wouldn't want to do a game she picked anyway,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.440
cause it's her game to talk about in her memory. It's not mine, especially when I don't know the

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.400
game. So we have to, and we haven't really had notice or time to prepare. So I had to pull

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:40.320
something literally out of the blue. However, I checked the Wiki and this game has not been done

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:46.240
before, believe it or not. So, uh, Loki, you're going to have to help me with tonight's classic

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:51.920
game of the week because, and I can't, I can't tell you why I was inspired to pick this game,

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:59.680
but the classic game of the week tonight is let me get it up here. Uh, magic pen gel.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:07.680
It's a classic game of the week. So, and well, it's funny cause I was like, surely we did this

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:13.040
as a classic game at some point because we did. I thought we did too, but I am on the Wiki right

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:19.120
now. I'm looking at it and I just did a control find. I'm like magic. Okay. There was magical

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.960
night dreams and magic. Nope, no match. That's why you just heard that flip because they can't

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:28.400
find a search for it. So there is no magic pen gel. It's not there. We just talk about it on

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:34.640
the show an awful lot. So there you go. So, but we can talk about magic pen gel now. So let's talk

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:41.680
about this. Um, and yeah, dark soccer and chat says, damn, it's old enough. Uh, Oh, and she said

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.800
I could have done the other game. I didn't know anything about that game, dark soccer. I didn't

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.840
want to do it. This played this game before. Yes. This game is old enough. It came out in

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:58.000
North America, June 24th, 2003. So this game is damn near 20 years old. It actually came out in

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:04.800
Japan, March 20th, 2002. So in Japan it's over 20 years old at this point. Okay. It's called magic

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:14.160
pen gel, the quest for color. It's a original name. Garakuta Meisaku Geijo Rakugake Okoku

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:18.560
is the original name of the game. It's a role playing game that was developed by Garakuta

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:24.240
studio and title for the PlayStation two here in North America. It was published by age tech

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:28.720
apparently studio Ghibli was involved in this game because the musical compositions in the

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.840
game were done by Zuntada. So there was also a sequel for the game that came later called

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:38.080
graffiti kingdom, but we're not talking about that tonight. Basically, what is this game? It's

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:45.840
Pokemon meets Mario paint. That's what it is. You create your own little creatures in a in game

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:52.560
drawing system that actually worked pretty well to basically do a version of Pokemon.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.040
The pen gels are with it. So they're not called Pokemon. They're called, I'm sorry. The pen gel

01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:04.000
is a little pen fairy thing that creates the doodles. So the doodles are actually

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.760
the little Pokemon. And so you sketch out what the body looks like and you have a certain amount

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.800
of magic energy. So like the link is, or the ink, excuse me, isn't unlimited. You have a certain

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:18.640
amount of it. And you do these battles with the custom created design, you trade with other

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.960
players. You know, it's interesting with this whole discussion about NFT tonight,

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.120
these magic pen gels could be NFTs essentially.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.600
Yeah, it's like our horrible 2d x controller that we stuff fight.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.120
Oh yeah, that's right. We drove drew like a 2d extra toy. This game was well,

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.400
Loki, why don't you talk about some of your memories with this game? Because you played

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.720
this more than I did really? Yes. Yeah. So it was fun because you did get the draw,

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:48.480
whatever you wanted in there. And based on the colors that you use, you'd have different

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:53.360
abilities. So I think like they have like, you know, magic abilities or physical attack and

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.520
stuff like that. It would depend on like the ink colors or paint colors they got. I think you would

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:03.200
unlock more as you went along. So of course, you know, we had, I think we had a 2d x controller

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:09.280
that we made. There was just one it was just a big, like box. It was just like a big blue box

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.640
thing. And of course, and the chat room is lighting up going penis, penis, penis, penis.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:21.520
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, come on. Yeah, of course. We did that worldwide audience here on Twitch.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:26.960
Come on. Of course, drawing a gigantic penis and balls was like one of the first

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:33.520
monsters created in this game. Everybody does it. Come on. It was fantastic. Yes. Such a glorious

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:39.440
game. In fact, I'm surprised this game wasn't called magic penis, because that's what everybody

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:46.160
made for their doodles. It was great, though, like, the thing about graffiti kingdom, though,

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.480
is a little bit different. So like, this game is more of a traditional kind of like RPG, like,

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.640
you like would battle and stuff. And they have like turn based battles. Whereas I think

01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:02.080
graffiti kingdom was more of a like an action RPG type thing, you would just kind of like,

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.440
roam the world and do them things. I never actually played graffiti kingdom. But

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:13.440
yeah, this game was pretty fun. It was the drawing technology in the game was based on

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:19.440
Takeo Igarashi's teddy software. And I'm not sure what else that was used in. But apparently,

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.680
it is a sketching interface for 3d design. So it was kind of based on something that

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:28.640
was already out there, which I think is very interesting. On the reception to this game,

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.880
it was average pretty much, you know, a lot of seven and eights around the board, C plus

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:38.160
things like that for me to gave it a 32 out of 40. So for me to you know, not bad,

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.920
especially in those years now they hand out 40s like they're nothing but back then that was still

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:49.760
still something in a review by IGN. It was noted that the monster creation system lives up to a

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:54.400
potential for creating unique looking creatures and providing gameplay depth, different body

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:58.880
parts, colors and sizes affected abilities and statistics in battle. Yeah, that was I always

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.080
thought that was really interesting, too. Even if at the end of the day, they're saying it was

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:07.520
a giant game of rock, paper, scissors. The variety of attacks and spells with the custom monsters

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:12.960
could be kind of funny. And you know, what's cool is that Teddy software is it's a 3d modeling asset

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:21.360
now for unity. Oh, we can make a sequel. That's kind of neat, though. So you could so you could

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:26.320
bring back the 2d x machine and the penis monster and put them in a unity asset game basically is

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.560
what you're saying. Sure, you could totally do that. It's not expensive. It's like 30 bucks.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:36.160
Just what I've always wanted. All right. Anyhow, let's see the care of some of the characters from

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.680
the game Zoe and Taro. They showed up later in a game called lost magic on the Nintendo DS,

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:49.120
which was also made by Tyto. So it looked like they aged a bit but that was magic pen gel. So

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:55.520
it was a lot of fun memories, especially if you go back to like early OLR. Because again,

01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:00.320
that game came out during the first or second year of OLR. When we were doing three hours

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:07.120
every week about literally nothing. We played this game a lot and it was it was a good time

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:11.600
many memories playing this game just because it was just silly to draw that it was it was

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:18.720
neat to draw them in a 2d space and see them 3d animated. That's what it was. It's like you could

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:24.960
draw a 2d x machine you could draw a boner you could draw all sorts of horribly animated

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:33.040
in 3d but it was so like bad it was funny type of thing. So yeah, anyway, magic pen gel I would

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:38.240
consider it a cult classic. And that's our classic game of the week for sure. I love this game.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:46.000
Anyway, there it is. Good pick Loki that inspired me to throw it in the back if you want to continue

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.680
watching the game Loki has it running behind him right now. Like I said, I can't imagine why I

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:56.560
thought to do this as the classic game of the week. But I was like surely surely that had been

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:02.160
picked at some point. Oh, no, no, no. Alrighty, then there we go. We'll do it tonight. We'll do

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:09.280
it live. All right, moving on. Let's get into some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:13.680
headlines around the industry. We'll start with Loki. I'll take the one that Jamie had. So I'll

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:19.680
take her story. You can do the other two lucky. All right. So the steam deck can now officially

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:24.480
run a ton more games than of course, when it launched. So I think when it launched,

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:31.520
it was about 400 games or so that were playable. Now they're almost up to 2500 games that are

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:40.240
playable. And then they verified it looks like about like 1200 of those that are, you know,

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:48.400
able to run I guess really well on the team deck. Yeah, 12 or 1289 games are fully verified.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:58.240
And they said a further 11 or 1169 are playable. I'm not sure what exactly the difference between

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:04.320
playable and verified me, I guess just how will they run? Maybe like graphical bugs,

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.600
skipping audio hiccups, like just probably performance just with like the chip that's

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:14.960
on there, the APU and stuff. So but yeah, that's cool. Let's see that a lot more are compatible

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.200
now. So yeah, I mean, everyone's pretty excited about the steam deck. So yeah,

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.320
but the early stuff I've heard is pretty good. I'm getting to the point where I think I kind

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.320
of want one. But now I'm just going to hold off and wait and see if valve refreshes the hardware

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:30.000
in it. It's still really hard to get obviously, as you know, there's still shortages and stuff.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.760
But I think at some point, you know, we had the story last week about how some of that is easing

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.880
up. And I'll wait to see when valve does the inevitable refresh of the steam deck and kind

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.440
of beefs up what's inside it, then maybe I'll try to get one.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:50.320
Yeah. So Sonic the Hedgehog Two is now officially the highest grossing movie adaptation of a video

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:59.440
game franchise at the US box office. They are they've reached $331 million. Whereas the previous

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:08.160
movie was 319 million. So they, which is pretty good, considering that the 319 million I mean,

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:14.560
I don't know what that necessarily means as far as this movie, but like, it made 319 million during

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.960
2020. Which, you know, when movie theaters are closed,

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:23.920
Oh, yeah, yeah, there were so many movie theaters that for like an entire year still had Sonic the

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.160
Hedgehog movie posters up because that was the big movie that came out the weekend before everything

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:34.560
shut down. Yeah, it's good movie. Good movies. Yeah. How much would the first one have made if

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:38.960
COVID didn't happen the way it did? That's a very, yeah, would that but it's hard to say

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:44.800
sequels almost always, you know, for big AAA franchises, sequels almost always outgrow the

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:50.400
original, which is why the bar for this new avatar, which I guess there's a there's a teaser

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:55.200
trailer that's been shown. I did not see it. Yeah, I've only seen like the reaction online

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:59.520
and stuff. So I don't I don't know if it just showed in random theaters or what or it was

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:05.360
supposed to be before Dr. Strange, but I, I went to the bathroom right before the move. Well,

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:11.440
like is typically at the movie theater and I was shocked. Typically, the movie times that they give

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:17.680
you is like practically when they start rolling trailers. But ironically, this time, the movie

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:23.680
started at the movie time. And so the trailers were actually earlier. So I missed like a trailer

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:29.680
or two. But yeah, who cares? It's Avatar. It's like way too late for a sequel for that. But

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:40.960
whatever. I cheddar cheddars here. Hi. cheddar does not like being picked up. Okay, bye cheddar.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:46.400
Anyway, um, but y'all wanted me to get cheddar on stream during all our at some point. So there you

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:51.680
go. Anyway, yeah. So Bobby says that he saw the trailer before strange. Alright, so I thought

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.160
because I you would think it'd be all over Twitter by now like leaks of the trailer and stuff. But

01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:02.640
yeah, they were just, you know, uploaded to YouTube like, yeah, movie studios do. But I

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:08.480
was just saying the bar for that one is going to be incredibly high. But anyway, um, it's

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:14.240
many folks in chatter saying cheddar did not look please know he doesn't really love getting picked

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:18.960
up. I did that for y'all because I promised I'd put cheddar on stream at some point. So

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:23.840
all right, if I put his little toy on that table back there, he might get up on that. So we'll see.

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:29.680
I'll try that again later. Anyway, um, what else is it gonna say with that? Oh,

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:35.520
I was just surprised honestly, that Sonic two is like the biggest video game movie,

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:40.480
but then I'm like, well, I guess really, what else would there have been? Right? Like either

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:46.240
it came out in the 90s. And there's been inflation since the 90s. But there hasn't been a lot recently

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:49.600
that like, you know, what a bowl movie was going to make that kind of money.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:56.320
Haha. Well, there is a Pokemon. Yeah, yeah. Detective Pikachu. That did really well.

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:01.840
But not that well, not as well, Sonic. I mean, honestly, there hasn't been a lot of

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.880
video game franchise movies that have come out that have done a lot. Yeah.

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:14.320
So it'll be, but now it's an article because it's slow. Here's, here's the other question.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:22.160
How long will Sonic to hold that crown? Because that Mario movie, I know it got bumped to 2023.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:27.680
And I'm, I'm sorry to make it a Mario versus Sonic thing, but let's be real. There's a lot

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:31.760
of people that are going to see that Mario movie. A lot of people that are going to take their kids

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:36.560
to see that Mario movie. I think Sonic's probably going to get to thrown by Mario,

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:42.560
which is hilarious to say. You got to, you got to admit there's a certain, I know, I know we got

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:47.040
like tiger claws, a huge Sonic fan in the chat, but you have to admit there's something funny

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:51.440
about me saying Sonic's about to get kicked out, get, get his butt kicked by Mario.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:58.400
But I think it is still, you know, that's still a huge accomplishment for Sonic. Cause honestly,

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:03.680
I never would have thought the first movie would have done as well as it did. And I don't know if

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:07.520
that, and that's no, no shade. It's just that video game movies don't tend to typically do

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:14.720
that well. So it, you know, did great. Phoenix 77, 26 says, Rob, there was a uncharted movie

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:19.840
a few months ago. Oh yeah. That's right. Yeah. That ain't breaking a box.

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:26.400
No, it is not. No, it is not. Orange. Right. It says how well did the angry birds movie do?

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:32.400
Not 300 million. Well, but those were actually pretty good. I like the first one. I've watched

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.960
the first one several times. I have not watched the second one, but the first one was pretty good.

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.400
All right. All right. In one other rapid fire news story here tonight,

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:48.480
Jason talked about this in the intro tonight, but it's, it's interesting. The gold plated

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:58.080
Nintendo Wii. It's a one of a kind Nintendo Wii is going up for auction. THQ who not the same THQ

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:03.120
Nordic that exists today, because this was the THQ before they went bankrupt and had had their

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:10.320
name bought by THQ Nordic. So the old THQ, uh, made this 24 karat gold plated Wii,

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:15.200
and they were intending to give it to queen Elizabeth in 2009. The whole fucking thing

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:21.520
was promotion for a flop game called big family games. Anyone remember big family games? We had

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:27.120
any big family games fans out there. You can probably tell by the title alone. It was that

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:35.200
kind of Wii title. And there was, it was like, look, we're like Wii sports too. Please buy us.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:40.160
There's so many of them. So many of them. Yeah. I would have thought it was Mario party,

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.200
but all right. But anyway, maybe we'll get a sequel to big family games on the switch.

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:53.280
However, here's the funny part. It never actually got to the queen because there is a very strict

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.720
Royal gift policy because who knows, maybe they thought there'd be anthrax in that Wii or

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:02.640
something. So they don't, they don't allow the queen to get gifts like that. So it was returned

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:11.360
to THQ. A collector got it from a studio contact in 2017. And now a Dutch collector named Don,

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:16.640
who runs, I guess, console variations is now putting this up for sale.

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:24.320
Originally, Don tried to sell this on eBay in October, 2021 for $300,000. However,

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:29.680
eBay originally shut them down because that's too much money. So now the auction is up at

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:36.400
golden, which is a place that allows these types of things. Bidding is already up to $2,000. I want

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:42.400
to actually see what it's at. Is it 3000 now? But like they give you big family games with it and

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:49.200
you, whoopee. Who wants to buy the gold-plated Wii so you can mod it?

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.720
I do. I want to mod it. I ain't paying for it.

01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:02.960
Well, you know what it won't do? Load the Wii shop or have online multiplayer because those

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:08.640
features are no longer available. Anyway, the whole thing's a big publicity stunt,

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.600
but it's an actual gold-plated Wii. I guess it works.

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:12.960
So there's that.

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:16.560
And the gold plating's chipping off on it. Ooh, that looks so great.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:21.520
DarkSakura still hanging out in our chat and lending her endless wit,

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:25.680
saying golden Wii is a sign of dehydration. We'll leave it at that.

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.040
Ssho100matt points out this title, the big family games, this gets localized,

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.920
but not President Cat. Don't get me started.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:38.160
Well, to be fair, big family games was probably in English,

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:43.440
so it'd take nothing to localize it. But yes, it's a terrible game.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.920
What's Mother 3's excuse? Happy Mother's Day.

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:51.200
All right. By the way, can I just say, again, Reggie Fils-Aime doing this whole book tour.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.760
So of course everyone's asking him about Mother 3.

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:58.560
And now he's posting tongue-in-cheek tweets about the whole thing.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.280
Reggie, you're great.

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:05.200
I've been enjoying the interviews I've been seeing with you in it.

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:08.000
I really can't wait to read your book.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.720
I really admire you, Reggie, and what you've done for the industry.

01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.360
Please just shut up about Mother 3.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:16.480
You're just pouring salt in the wound.

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:18.240
Please just shut up about Mother 3.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.480
Just say, it didn't happen.

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.320
It's not everything happens in the end.

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.360
Now shut up and move on.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.200
Just please, for all of our sake.

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:28.400
And people, the rest of the industry, stop asking him about it.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.080
He doesn't work for Nintendo anymore.

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.600
Stop asking him what happened.

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:34.480
It just, it didn't happen.

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:36.640
Moving on.

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:40.400
Let's talk about some games that will come out, unlike Mother 3,

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.720
in a segment called World Release Dates.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.320
Let's start with the U.S., Loki.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:50.960
We have IUDEN Chronicles Rising on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.000
and Xbox Series.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:57.520
Salt and Sacrifice on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:04.320
We Were Here Forever on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.160
Let's see.

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:13.360
Brigadine, The Legend of Runzea, I don't know.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.240
That's going to be out on PC.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:26.480
And then we have the Centennial Case, a Shinjima story on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.840
PlayStation 5.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:32.320
And last but not least, Evil Dead, the game on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.320
5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:35.860
All right.

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.440
Let's go over to Japan and check out the releases there.

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:44.080
So coming out in Japan this week on the Nintendo Switch, Gold Week was this last week.

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.920
So now we're getting into releases again.

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:50.560
So May 12th, we'll see on Nintendo Switch, the Centennial Case, a Shinjima story is out

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:51.360
this week.

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.760
And Dead by Daylight gets a release on Nintendo Switch.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:57.200
I think that was already out in Japan, but they're getting an Ultimate Edition.

01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.520
And I was like, well, what's all in the Ultimate Edition?

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.200
And I noticed Oni is on the cover.

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:02.480
So OK, that one's there.

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:08.640
But then as I look at the list of DLC, there's 13 pieces of DLC, including Portrait of a

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:09.760
Murder, which is pretty recent.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.920
That's the artist all included with it.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.520
So that's pretty impressive.

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:18.640
That's a lot of stuff for basically what is otherwise a standard price Nintendo Switch

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:18.880
game.

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:21.200
So yeah, pretty interesting deal there.

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:22.720
So that is out in Japan this week.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.600
Moving over to the PlayStation 5.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.160
Same thing.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:31.440
You get Dead by Daylight is also out in Japan on PlayStation 5, as is the Centennial Case.

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.560
Yeah, that's it.

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.160
Let's go over to the UK.

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:39.440
Do you have that available, Loki?

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.400
Or do I need one?

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.080
Yeah, not a whole lot coming out there.

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:49.200
So we've got Tourist Bus Simulator that's going to be coming out on PlayStation, Evil

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.720
Dead, the game on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.800
And let's get fit on the Switch.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:55.300
That's it.

01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:59.200
Dark Soccer's pointing out DBD is super huge in Japan.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:03.600
Yeah, I think it's actually it's been growing in a relatively recently over there.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:05.600
So that's kind of interesting.

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.520
SG100 Matt says the Evil Dead, the game looks fun, by the way.

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:10.800
Also very Sam Raimi.

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.240
I'd like to check that game out.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.400
I'll watch people play it on Twitch and see if it's for me or not.

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.360
So all right.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.280
We have just a few more stories for you.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:21.920
And then we'll invite your calls and your emails.

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:25.440
I know we have at least one email tonight and whatever else your chat comments in our

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:26.240
listener roundtable.

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.120
But first, let's get you some more stories.

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.480
Loki, I think you have one for us.

01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:38.160
Yeah, Hayden Blackman is apparently leaving Hangar 13 studio, which was the studio that

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.080
created Mafia 3.

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:47.440
And, you know, with that, even though he is leaving, they are going to be continuing on

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:53.040
with a new Mafia game that'll be coming out at some point, I guess.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:53.840
Whenever it's done.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.280
Whatever it's done.

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:55.920
Yeah.

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:59.600
So we haven't had a new one of those in a while, right?

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.960
Mafia 3 didn't come out very.

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:03.760
Yeah, it was a while ago.

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.040
It was a while ago at this point.

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.120
Yeah, but they're saying, though, that the new Mafia game that was expected to be made

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:13.520
in the Unreal Engine 5 instead of the Mafia 3 engine.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.640
So, I mean, Unreal 5 looks pretty awesome.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.080
So cool.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.360
I can't wait to see that.

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:19.840
Yeah.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.600
And then I play it because I don't play any of the Mafia.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.560
Well, let's talk.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.680
But it will look cool.

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.040
I got this story.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.960
This next story JB was going to do, but I'll talk about it.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.880
Let's talk about another game nobody is interested in playing, apparently, and that's Babylon's

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:35.520
fall, man.

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.520
The news just gets worse and worse in this game.

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.560
I got to admit, I had a curious eye on this game at first because I heard about the Final

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:44.720
Fantasy 14 assets being used and so forth.

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:50.320
And then I heard about the cash in the cash in the cash, and they were so desperate to

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:55.600
make this a live service game that they could keep cashing in on after that initial $60

01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:00.400
fee that, boy, that whole thing really shot him in the foot, even though platinum games

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.320
usually makes platinum titles.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:02.960
This one.

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:03.200
Wow.

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.680
In fact, a lot of news sites are running with this headline.

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.920
It's down to one concurrent player.

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:11.840
Well, here's the thing.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.880
You know, those concurrent player counts are a snapshot in time, and somebody caught on

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:23.600
Steam charts that there was one player playing it on Wednesday, May 4th, 2022.

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.440
So on May the fourth, May the fourth was not with Babylon's fall because one person was

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:29.760
playing it.

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.800
They probably just left their computer on or something in the middle of the night.

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.440
But it's noon somewhere in the world.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:38.960
So, yeah, that's not a great look for this game.

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:44.640
Of course, we had already talked about a story not that long ago where it was only like a

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.840
thousand people if that were playing it like when the game came out.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.800
So, yike.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:55.200
And, you know, they kept promising they're going to try to make improvements, but we're

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.000
not seeing them yet.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.800
But platinum games is saying there is no plans to scale back the development of Babylon's

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:01.040
fall.

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:06.800
I think if they want this game to have a chance, they're going to have to fall the price to

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:07.120
free.

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.760
And that's it.

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.680
That's the do or die moment for this game.

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:17.520
Follow the price to free or this game is done and you all are wasting your fucking time.

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:21.520
But that's just my perception on that.

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:22.320
Loki, I don't know.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.240
Any interest at all in Babylon's fall?

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:25.760
No, not at all.

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.000
I'd check it out if it was free.

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:29.680
Platinum games is great.

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:30.320
I'd check it out.

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:31.120
Even do that.

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:31.620
Yeah.

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:32.800
All right.

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:35.680
They probably have more than one player, that's for sure.

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:38.160
Loki, what do you got for us next?

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:45.280
I had to check and see what year it was because we're getting reports that Nintendo sports

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:48.320
fans, it's TV smashing time.

01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:54.320
So folks aren't following the concert reminders to put wrist straps on and they're throwing

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:59.360
their Nintendo Switch controllers into the screens.

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:04.480
Joy cons are taking flight and smashing into screens.

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:09.120
What happens if you only have a switch light?

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:12.960
Do you just do you accidentally throw your entire switch because you don't have?

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.600
I don't know if you can play that game on the switch light, to be honest.

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.040
I heard it's limited.

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:22.160
Like there's only certain games you can play and it's limited.

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:26.480
I would think you could just get a second pair of independent joy cons and pair them

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:28.240
to the switch light and play them that way.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.600
I would think true.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.080
Yes.

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:33.360
In that case, you'd have to do a combo with that.

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:41.040
You would throw your loose joy cons into the screen, which is exactly.

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.800
So it's a little bit more challenging, but if you're up for the challenge, then you

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:49.920
could break everything.

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:52.560
All right.

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:58.080
E3VL in chat says it only works tabletop on single player, cannot play multiplayer.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:38:59.520
All right.

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:02.400
Lastly, I'm sorry.

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.560
I thought this headline was too funny, even though I will fully admit I've never really

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:11.360
played this game, but I've heard the jokes over the years about how Eve online is basically

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:12.640
a spreadsheet simulator.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.560
Well, I'll be damned.

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.080
I think this is so funny.

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:18.480
So there's actually, you know, there's enough people that play this game.

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:21.040
I haven't played it, but it's still a fairly popular online game.

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:26.720
It's got its fans and they have this Eve fan fest that they do well at the fan fest.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:33.040
They announced, they reached out to Microsoft and there is now an official extension that

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:39.360
will pull data from Eve online and automatically put it into an Excel spreadsheet.

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:45.440
So an official Microsoft collaboration, a Microsoft Excel add on for Eve online and

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:48.560
the crowd, as you would expect, went fucking nuts.

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:51.360
And they were very, cause you know, they're all in on the joke.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.880
So they went nuts and people tweeting, this is the best update that Eve has ever done.

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:05.600
So an early prototype of this was shown and more details are coming out later this year.

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.400
And that's pretty awesome.

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:11.200
Also, of course, there was more announced a fan fest, not just Excel.

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:14.960
Can you imagine if you went, can you imagine going to Blizzcon?

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:22.480
And the big announcement is now we're, now we're going to work with PowerPoint.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.120
That's a big announcement.

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:29.920
Of course, that would still be a better year than the year they announced the Diablo mobile

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:30.640
phone game.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.560
Don't you all have phones?

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:37.360
Which is finally coming out in June.

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.240
Exciting, right?

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:43.280
And then apparently, I know we didn't talk about it on the show cause we don't talk about

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:46.640
current topics, but I will just say they did announce something else.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.440
It looks like trash.

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.320
I'm sorry.

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.480
It looks like such trash.

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:53.040
Yikes.

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:53.520
I'm sorry.

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:53.920
I'm sorry.

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:54.560
I can't help it.

01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:55.520
All right.

01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:01.040
Anyhow, but Microsoft Excel, I'm all for that kind of collaboration.

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.960
Bobby Black Wolf says CCP has that kind of humor too.

01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.000
So it fits.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:06.500
Yeah.

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:08.580
All right.

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:13.120
Let's move on to, I think that was it for stories.

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.400
So now we're ready to talk to our listeners and listen around table.

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:20.160
If you would like to give us a call, you can join our discord server, vog network.com

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:20.960
slash discord.

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:23.200
That's VOG network.com slash discord.

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:27.120
And if you had to head to the green room, we'll take some of your calls on the show,

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:32.240
but I know we had at least one email because we always invite your emails as well, because

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:37.600
I know people listen to us on the podcast feed available in all your favorite podcast

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.160
apps.

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:41.440
And so some of you will send emails throughout the week.

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:48.320
Sorry, I'm buying time because I'm not logged into the email bag currently, but I know I

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:52.240
saw at least one come in earlier and it's from somebody who actually calls us quite

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:52.740
a bit.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.040
We have an email tonight from Rama.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.880
Participate at orange launch, radio.com.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:02.960
If you want to send us an email for a future week, Rama writes in and says, greetings,

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:03.920
one and all.

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:07.520
I hope that the weekend has been eventful for you all a couple of things and I'll be

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:08.400
on my way.

01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:14.640
Number one, is there a game that you started playing that at first you thought was mediocre,

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:17.760
but as you played more of it, you ended up falling in love with the game.

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.080
For example, I bought persona five for a friend to play in stream.

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:25.840
At first, when she started playing, it was all right to her and she wasn't sure that

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.040
she'd continue.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:33.600
But one year and 300 plus hours later, she ended up loving the game, the lore, the characters,

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.400
everything with it.

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:35.840
Yes.

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:39.280
And I've mentioned this one on the show before, and you're going to say, oh, of course.

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.960
But my answer to this is easy.

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.840
Mass Effect would be it because the first time I played Mass Effect, I didn't get it.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.080
I was just like, oh, this is just shooty, shooty, bang, bang.

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.040
I don't think I'm into this.

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:50.080
Whatever.

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:55.680
This is just, yeah, I don't like RPGs unless they're JRPGs.

01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:57.360
I don't really want to play this anymore.

01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:02.800
And then I went back years later to check out the entire trilogy and I fell in love

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.280
with it.

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.360
And I love the original trilogy.

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:09.120
And obviously, as you all know, some of my favorite games that have ever been made.

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:10.320
So that's my easy answer.

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:12.080
I mean, and I think you all saw it coming.

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.000
Loki, is there one for you?

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:17.360
I can't think of anything offhand.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:17.860
Maybe.

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:20.320
I mean, I don't know.

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:26.160
It wasn't necessarily mediocre, but like I know Minecraft originally, like when it first

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:27.440
came out, I didn't get it.

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:28.160
And you know what?

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:28.800
Me too.

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:32.800
I didn't play it, but it wasn't that I played it and went, this is all right.

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:35.120
Once I played, I was like, Oh man, this is awesome.

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:38.880
So there was never kind of a mediocre point to that.

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.000
But yeah, I can't really think of anything.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.440
I mean, I'm sure there's something.

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:46.640
The other one that's obvious for me is No Man's Sky.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.720
You know, I never showed up about that game here on the show.

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:50.560
I love that game now.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:56.320
But the difference there is that, and we all know this, No Man's Sky today in 2021, 17

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:59.360
patches later, is not the same game that originally was released.

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:04.320
So it's not quite a fair game to use as an answer to that, I think.

01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:06.880
Some answers from our chat.

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:09.120
SH2100 Matt says Undertale for me.

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:11.600
Let's see.

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:17.200
Dark Sakura is still in chat hanging out, saying Mass Effect, Dragon Age 2, and Dead

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.800
by Daylight for me.

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:19.300
Oh yeah.

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:25.920
I'm trying to think if I played Dead by Daylight before Alan started watching all the Twitch

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:28.000
streamers and I got into it that way.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.040
I don't think I ever did.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.640
I didn't even really play it until I watched Alan watching all the Twitch streamers.

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.160
And I was like, all right, I'll try this.

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:37.680
And then Alan was playing it too.

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:38.800
And I was like, all right, I'll try this.

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:40.560
And then I turned out I really liked it.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.320
Dark Sakura says, wow, World of Warcraft as well.

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:48.160
Like for her, it wasn't until Cataclysm that it got good and then it got crap again.

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:48.660
Yeah.

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:51.120
Yeah.

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:54.480
Wow was one of those games like I would kind of go back and forth with too.

01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:57.760
Like I started it, then I went away, then I started again and all that stuff.

01:44:58.720 --> 01:44:59.220
All right.

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:01.680
Back to Rama's email.

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:05.360
Number two, this is a follow-up to my call from two weeks ago.

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:10.240
As of May 2nd, I am no longer a contract employee for the company I work for.

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:14.160
I am now a full-time employee with the benefits the company has to offer.

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:16.240
For that, I'm very thankful and appreciative.

01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:20.400
As I said before, being a contract employee can suck because you don't get the full benefits

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:22.240
and discounts the company has to offer.

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:23.760
But if you wait it out, work hard.

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:25.600
And if you're lucky enough, you'll be in.

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:28.800
For the record, during my tenure as a contract employee for NBC,

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:33.760
Fresh Direct and a couple other places, I've seen temps quit and go on to greener pastures.

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:38.000
I stayed because I felt appreciated for the work that I did and the pay wasn't bad.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.080
Take care, stay fabulous, Rama.

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.520
Well, congratulations, Rama.

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:43.040
Big hearty congratulations.

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:43.680
You did it.

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:44.480
You earned it.

01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:47.360
And I can't think of anyone more deserving personally.

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:49.840
So I'm very happy for you, Rama.

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:50.880
Congratulations on that.

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.240
Loki, I think that was the week you were off for your surgery.

01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:58.720
But that was the week that the Nintendo thing was in the headline about the contract workers

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:01.760
and all that and how Nintendo was treating contract workers was.

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:02.640
No, I was there.

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:03.120
Oh, were you?

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:05.040
I can't remember who was here.

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:08.080
Well, yeah, either that or I can listen to it.

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:08.560
I don't remember.

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.040
No, no, it was the week goes out.

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.160
But I was listening to the show.

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:13.440
That's why I remember that.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.640
So Rama called in and then talked about, oh, I have a unique perspective on this and then

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:19.840
talked about how you know that.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.760
So that's a lovely follow up.

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:22.720
So congratulations.

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:23.360
It's wonderful.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.680
So, yeah.

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:26.880
Yay.

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.000
Everybody's giving applause.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.120
There's clap emojis.

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:29.360
Yay.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:29.680
Yay.

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:32.320
We're happy for DJ Rama S. Congratulations.

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.040
You did the thing.

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.200
That's it for emails.

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:40.240
If you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:42.720
I am looking in the green room.

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:43.680
I don't see anyone.

01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:52.080
And DarkSakura wants to clarify she's in chat because she's still her head is fine when

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.760
she's not trying to be on camera.

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:57.680
So like she can like lie down and be on the keyboard and all that stuff or whatever, like

01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:58.960
be at a different configuration.

01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:03.440
So she's able to let her migraine chill out and chat and not have the focus on.

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.040
So we're glad she's still there in chat.

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:08.800
I don't have anything else.

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.720
Do you have any last minute stories, Loki?

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.840
I was trying to find something, but it actually.

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.640
Well, I think remember it was Gold Week in Japan, so it actually was a slower Newsweek.

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:21.760
I mean, we still had a show full of stories, but believe it or not,

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.640
I think at this point we're kind of in that whole little waiting period until it's the

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.840
quiet before the non E3, the non E3.

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:30.880
But now it's going to be summer.

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:33.280
Why?

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.160
Oh, my God.

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:38.240
My watch suddenly was like, here's everything you want to know about E3.

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:40.240
They're dead, Siri.

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:40.880
They're dead.

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.960
Siri came on again and was like, Who's dead?

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:48.240
Anyway, how about you all in chat?

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:50.000
Do you have any topics you'd like us to discuss?

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.240
You know what?

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:57.120
Whatever is fair game tonight, whatever you want to ask us about is fair game tonight.

01:47:58.560 --> 01:47:58.800
Yeah.

01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.080
Bobby Black was like, serious.

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:00.720
Like, are you dead?

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:01.520
I will make a call.

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:02.080
No, I'm fine.

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:02.560
I'm alive.

01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:03.760
Dark to see.

01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:04.880
It says you got to stop doing that.

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:06.080
I need to turn.

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:10.800
I never use Siri on the watch.

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.920
I'll use it on the phone, especially in my car, because I don't want to use.

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.040
You know, I'm driving.

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:16.880
I'll say, like, give me directions to so and so.

01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:17.760
But that's it.

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:24.240
I also use it a lot to say, set a reminder to do this, because it's so much easier than

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.400
going in and trying to actually set it on the calendar.

01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:27.840
So there's that.

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:34.320
Bobby Black Wolf says, look at the summer games done quick schedule and see all the

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.120
rhythm games.

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:37.280
Okay, so where are we going?

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:39.040
Games done quick.

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:39.760
Oh, how about that?

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:41.200
It's like the first search result there.

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:43.280
Games done quick schedule.

01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:46.720
All right, let's take a peek at this and see what we get.

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.400
Let's go there.

01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:50.400
Let's see.

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:57.280
Oh, I didn't know they already had, like, all of the hosts were assigned stuff.

01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:58.240
Gosh.

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:00.800
Okay, let's see.

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.000
Oh, they're running Mass Effect.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:02.640
That's cool.

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:03.920
I okay.

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:04.560
The original.

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:07.440
I'm seeing.

01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:11.440
So they said, look, Bobby says, look, yay, Blaster Master.

01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:12.640
Sorry, I'm looking at all these games.

01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:14.560
They said, oh, my gosh, so many good ones on the NES.

01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.640
Let's see.

01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:17.680
Where are all the music games?

01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.640
I imagine they put them in a big block somewhere.

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:26.640
Oh, they haven't put who's announcing the games, just who's running them.

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.520
Because I'm like, I know Bobby and Froob have worked together for, like, five of these now.

01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:35.040
I know Bobby's going to do this one unless there's something real wild happens.

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.040
So Thursday night is what Bobby says to look at.

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:40.960
Oh, King's Quest five.

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:41.460
Yay.

01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:43.280
Let's see.

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:50.480
There's step mania, not itg sound voltex.

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:50.800
Wow.

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:53.040
That must be more of an expedition type of game.

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:53.840
That's interesting.

01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:56.240
That's kind of neat.

01:49:58.400 --> 01:49:58.640
Yeah.

01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:01.120
Step mania, not itg should be interesting.

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.680
A couples exhibition, and that's going to be in person.

01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:04.880
Wow.

01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.640
Are they doing any mixing?

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:08.400
Copy play time.

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:12.720
Are they doing any mixing of the, like, hybrid stuff?

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:20.720
Like some people had theorized could happen is that they would actually mix the stuff

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:23.440
like when they needed to do a set change.

01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:23.760
Okay.

01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:24.000
Yeah.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.040
Part of these are remote.

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:25.280
Okay.

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:26.320
That's what I thought.

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:29.680
See, I think that's a smart thing for Summer Games.

01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:35.520
So quick to do is that in awesome games is do when they have a big set change in person

01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:37.120
to run some of the remote stuff.

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:37.680
That's great.

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:39.600
Awesome.

01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.000
So that's a good schedule.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:42.720
That should be fun.

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:45.120
All right.

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:48.080
That, like, you know, I have to check out the VR stuff.

01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:52.240
Like, they have a Half Life Alex and super hot VR looks pretty cool.

01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:54.320
Didn't they do a Half Life Alex run last time?

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:54.880
What they did.

01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:55.520
Probably.

01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:55.920
Yeah.

01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:56.480
I don't know.

01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:01.920
I get all their, like, stuff through YouTube, and they do, like, a bunch of different runs

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:05.680
throughout the year outside of Summer Games and awesome games.

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:11.440
Mike Def points out Elden Ring is the closing game this year that tracks because it's new

01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:14.480
and it's very popular, especially on the streaming services.

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:17.360
That's going to be a good one to close with.

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:18.720
I'm not surprised that at all.

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:23.840
You know, obviously, we're past the days of, like, Metroid being the or Super Metroid always

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:26.320
being the closer or something along those lines.

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.240
So, yeah, I'm not too surprised with Elden Ring.

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:30.560
It's only so many times you can do Super Metroid.

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:35.520
Well, and then there was the incident that one year and ever since then, you know, they

01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:39.600
started saying, do we have to do this as the closer every time?

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:41.680
And it turns out the answer is no.

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:45.600
It still is a successful marathon, even when you run other games as the closing game.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:46.100
So.

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:47.280
All right.

01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:51.760
I do like the randomizer race or, like, the races that they do and, like, randomizer stuff.

01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:52.320
Those are fun.

01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:54.160
Yeah, I like those two.

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:54.720
Those are fun.

01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:56.400
All right.

01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:00.080
Well, that's going to bring us to a close for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.120
Thank you all so much for tuning into our show tonight.

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:04.000
We really appreciate it.

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:07.600
If you enjoyed what you heard here, help us spread the word because we are the show where

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:08.880
every gamer has a voice.

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:12.000
But if we don't have the voices here, we can't put them out on air.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.760
So tell a friend or two about the show.

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:18.720
Share on social media a five star review on iTunes, Spotify or wherever you found this

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:20.560
podcast goes an awful long way.

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.640
We really appreciate all of it for sure.

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:26.720
And they are doing I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:30.240
They are doing a relay race for Super Mario Maker two.

01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:31.520
I'm definitely going to watch that.

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:32.240
It's going to be awesome.

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:32.740
That's awesome.

01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:37.700
If you want to join the Discord and continue the conversation throughout the week, vognetwork.com,

01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:40.420
that's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:42.180
We hope to see you there.

01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:46.740
In person appearance coming up at Dragon Con again this year.

01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:48.180
So check that out.

01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:50.740
And there might be something coming up here locally.

01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:54.180
I have to talk to you off air about that Loki with Dark Soccer because I got an interesting

01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:54.500
email.

01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.580
So message you about that.

01:52:56.580 --> 01:53:01.620
So other than that, that's it.

01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:02.580
I don't know what else to say.

01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:03.780
It's final thought time.

01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:06.180
Loki, do you have a final thought tonight?

01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:09.780
I have to check out with this Kaiser Super Metroid run.

01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:12.260
It's going to be two because I like Kaiser Mario stuff.

01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:15.620
So Kaiser Super Metroid will be insane, I'm sure.

01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:16.900
Yeah.

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:19.300
My final thought is I need to get into randomizers.

01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:23.700
Like I've always wanted to play a Zelda randomizer or a Metroid randomizer and get into some

01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:26.260
of the logic that comes with running those because you have to.

01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:29.300
You know, there's a lot of thinking about this before this and this.

01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:30.340
I want to get into those.

01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:31.860
I've just never really made the time for it.

01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:34.340
And I definitely need to make the time for that.

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.820
So yes, I will do that.

01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:38.660
That's it.

01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:40.740
We hope to see you again next week.

01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:41.300
We'll be back.

01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:44.660
Believe it or not, we're almost on the 20th anniversary end of June.

01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:46.900
This show is 20 years old, if you can believe it.

01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:51.700
And we have no idea what special thing we're doing yet, because that's how we roll here

01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:52.820
at OLR.

01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:54.180
Have a wonderful night, everybody.

01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:56.100
We'll see you in seven days to do it all again.

01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:58.900
And hopefully the gang is able to all get back together next time.

01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:04.180
Again, a happy Mother's Day to all the moms and motherly figures out there and gamer mommies.

01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:07.140
And I hope you all have a wonderful week.

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:08.260
Take care, everybody.

01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:09.140
Have a good night.

01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:33.940
