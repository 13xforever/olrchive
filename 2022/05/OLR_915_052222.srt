00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Microsoft applied for a patent for allowing a secondary device to validate a disk enabling a primary device without an optical disk drive to license and run that media.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
One possible translation? Microsoft applied for a patent for allowing a PC to validate a game disk enabling a diskless Xbox Series console to license and run that game.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
A patent is not a guarantee that it'll happen, but it is a neat consideration.

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to discuss this story and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode number 915 of our show for tonight, May the 22nd of 2022.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined by my co hosts. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hello.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hi, how are you doing?

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm doing good.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Good. Also joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie. Oh, she just sat down. I was gonna say she stepped away, but then she stepped back. Hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hi.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hi, you have impeccable timing. How are you?

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, I'm okay.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
All right. Did you go shopping this weekend? Because I see a bag with kitties on it behind you. At least that's what it looks like from a distance. Okay, I was

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I went earlier. And what I do is that when I go to different places, I sort them by the kind of material they are in the back of my car. Oh, so what the reason why I do that is so that I can like take a bag to my office. It's got art supplies, I can take a bag to the kitchen for food, I can take one to the bathroom for toiletries.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But in this case, the stuff that goes in here usually art supplies. And I've been scouring all the Rosses I can find near me. Because I lucked into acrylic paper, which is typically something like 20 to 30 bucks for 10 sheets of paper, which and I don't know I found them for two bucks a pop.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know if it's a national chain, but Ross dress for less or some of my friends all over the place. Some of my friends affectionately call it cross dress for less.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, it it just happened to have sometimes and I bought Copics they had a pack of Copic chows that had colors I didn't have so I picked them up.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can get good deals those places I get coffee finding a Copic a set of Copics is like finding a unicorn though.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I get coffee supplies to those places for cheap not just the cups for like sugar free sweeteners and all that type of stuff you get cheap. That stuff's more common. Yeah.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The pack of Copic markers that I paid 20 bucks for are about 35 retail.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And on top of that it's a high end art supplies so we love a sale with.

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's true. I was I was like, I found the pack and that now mostly I work with Copic sketch markers which are about $8 per marker.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But I'm not going to say no to a pack of Copic chow like it's the same ink same quality same nibs. I was like, heck yeah, and it had a blue multi liner in it which I was looking for.

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So, that's cool. And I can buy canvas is really cheap there too.

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's good because there's no, no longer there used to be an art supply store that was everywhere called Aaron brothers my mom that was my mom's favorite store because they're Aaron brothers is hardly an art supply store, well but they're they're

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
they did framing and they're no longer anyway they went out, they all went under. So, yeah, I just remember there's still loved going there.

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I think university artists still around so is a blix art supply which is a bigger chain and they are dedicated art.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There's, I actually I buy Copics at Michael's of all places because the Joanne's here doesn't have a very good selection. And the Michaels actually does, and they'll sometimes do like a buy one get one half price.

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And for Copics that's unbelievable. Well believe it or not it's a video game podcast but you know what we know that you want sales on all the merchandise to make your fan art.

31
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So when you all out there are celebrating the dead by daylight dating sim that's coming out we'll talk about later in the show or is literally doing dead by daylight fan art is dark soccer showing off on stream, because we do take live every Sunday night

32
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:35,000
at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific, and they can catch the VOD if they want to see it twitch.tv slash vog network that's VOG network, and we'll talk about deals for all sorts of things.

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We also sometimes talk about other types of media, not just video games, but Loki I can't help but notice you've got a classic eight bit Disney game playing behind you because there were, there were some really good like Capcom had the Disney license for games in the

34
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
job with they made some great Mickey Mouse could pay DuckTales of course all 10 classics but you plan tonight, rescue.

35
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah, I have a feeling this has to do with that movie that just came out a few days ago. Because it's up. Go ahead. Absolutely fantastic. Yes, I'm seeing it all over the game blogs because I guess they brought back the Sonic the hedgehog that everybody hated from the original trailer and they call them ugly.

36
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes, but I was laughing because ugly Sonic apparently does appearances at fan conventions now and I was just laughing because that's just like that's such a like I haven't even seen the movie, but that's just like such a thing for ugly Sonic to do to capitalize on that one appearance

37
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:55,000
that they made and believe me, you all know I do multiple things I don't just host to LR I've met a lot of people in my other gig that try to make that one appearance that they did last for a long time. What I will, I will, I will just say two words that will illustrate this point very well. Miss Vangie.

38
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, that's that's that's an entire empire based off of a infamous exit. But okay, so but it's not even though all the gaming blogs are talking about ugly Sonic. My understanding is the movie just consistently throws like, like that's every Gen X millennial like Zillennial or the trail generation like that, like the our age basically references everywhere.

39
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They integrate the pop culture like cartoon and live action stuff, and like even like CG puppets, like all sorts of things together in like one cohesive world. It's not like Space Jam where it's like, hey, you remember that? Hey, you remember that? Like it actually makes sense like in the world and, and they make fun of things that it's, it's hilarious. The premise is hilarious.

40
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Just like the jokes are ridiculous in a lot of the things. I don't know. It's like, I know when I saw like the trailer for the movie, I was like, you know, I like Andy Samberg. I like Oh, gosh, I can't remember the other guy's name.

41
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Um, we don't like that much. No, I can John Mulaney. So I, so I like their work a lot. Like they're great writers on SNL. They have a lot of really funny stuff that they do in that. And like, there is just like, it just comes like all of their like personality comes out and all these characters and stuff and they just it's it's hilarious, like the different like characters that they bring back and like just the whole bunch of stuff.

42
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The whole plot line. Everything is ridiculous. And some of the gags that they do even like with the ugly Sonic stuff. It's just, it's hilarious. It's all hilarious. It's so good. Like, I don't know. Like I was watching as like, this is why is it this good? Like this is ridiculous. It shouldn't even be this good.

43
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Um, DJ rama. I'm sorry. Let me get some several comments in our chat room. sj 100. Matt says is the movie good. It looked totally trashy in the sense that it knows it's trashy and it's just joking on itself. DJ rama says there's some cringe but overall it was really good. The remake of the rescue Rangers theme is trash though. Mike Deaf says it was okay for me not that great but funny and entertaining way better than Space Jam two. So there is that

44
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
that is a low bar to hit but yes.

45
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:48,000
All right, well, I'll check it out ways but I'm a sucker for good reference. Somebody sent me there's like a billboard in the background that shows Doug from Nickelodeon's Doug is now a lawyer and like the gag was really funny. It said something like there's nothing funny about injury because his name was Doug funny. And it's Yes. And that was that was funny. So there's a lot of that stuff. There's absolutely a ton of that stuff.

46
00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:14,000
There's a joke that's about like, it's, you know, like the Batman Superman stuff. Well, this one's like Batman versus et. And then they they they see see that on a billboard and then they come back like immediately right after that and actually show a clip of the movie. And it's so stupid. I'm a sucker. It's great. I'm a sucker for a quick hit pun. Like I'm for a quick hit. There's so many why I loved Mitch Hedberg.

47
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Like that was the entire routine. It feels a little bit like like, I don't want to not really necessarily compare it to the Zucker Brothers stuff. But it's kind of like that where there's a lot of just like gags in the background and some of this stuff. Like if you don't like notice it, you might like miss a joke. Like I was laughing throughout the movie like a bunch of things that my kids like they don't get the reference because of like half the stuff in there.

48
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I was gonna say some of the soccer movie stuff is kind of lame. Some of it is classic, obviously, like some of the old school stuff is classic. Like but then I thought like, Oh, but they did the later scary movies, movies after the Wayans brothers, right? Because like the way I don't want to, but the later I don't want to

49
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:17,000
spoil too much, but like, so like zipper and gadget end up like becoming a couple. And so they have a family. So you have to imagine, well, how's that work? A fly and a mouse? Well, they elaborate on that. And it's hilarious. All right. All right.

50
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I have to check it out some way. Sounds funny. Yeah. All right. Let's get into video games. I know. I know. But we got it. We got to talk about video games, or we're not allowed to call ourselves a video game podcast. But you know what, there's there's lots of platforms out there with media that are dipping their toe into gaming. And I think that's gonna do our kickoff topic for tonight. Loki, what do we got?

51
00:10:38,000 --> 00:11:07,880
Yeah, so tick tock has already, they're adding games to their platform, because, you know, they want to get people on that platform, and they want to stay there. So they've added a few small games, and they're planning to roll out more games as part of I guess, Southeast Asia later this year. Right now, they are. I don't really have that many games added in there. They have, I guess,

52
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:37,920
was a disco loco 3d. It's a game from Zynga. And then they also have like some other like free to play stuff. It's a lot of mobile games like Marvel snap. So yeah, they're going to be incorporating more games into the platform. I don't know how that necessarily like, is it just that you can go play games there? Or is it like, does that integrate with the platform somehow? Like, I'd be curious to see what that means. Like, are you sharing clips of the

53
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,440
games? I mean, like, what is it?

54
00:11:39,480 --> 00:12:07,760
I imagine it integrates with the platform a little bit. It's kind of it kind of reminds me of when Facebook was kind of doing this through messenger. And I think to some extent, they still have it. But I know they were pushing it pretty hard for a little bit is that in messenger, you could just like jump right into a game of Pac Man or something like that, where you actually but it was like a Pac Man competing against the other person type of thing. By the way, happy birthday, Pac Man. Maybe that's why it's on my my brain tonight. But I think this is something like that is that it probably is

55
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:37,640
still launched within the tick tock app. But it is more of a gaming experience. I mean, if it was smart, they would allow you to share clips and things like that. But I don't know, I would think a lot of the success of this depends on the quality of the game. There's a lot of mobile games that have a reputation for being crappy mobile games. That's why I think when Facebook had Pac Man, it was interesting, because Pac Man has a reputation behind it. Everybody knows what Pac Man is, you know, if tick tock got Mario Kart, people would pay attention.

56
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:49,480
Yeah, even Mario Kart mobile wasn't as good as the mainline games, but I digress. You know, I don't know if tick tocks going to really break through if the games don't get people to notice. You know what I mean?

57
00:12:50,300 --> 00:13:02,080
No, I get what you're saying. And yeah, I don't know if they're going to be I mean, they mentioned a game. So it's like, I don't know, maybe like,

58
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:14,760
I mean, they might they might do that. Okay, so I think about like, it take talk as a platform really makes its living. I don't know what else to call it off of people endlessly watching. That's it's

59
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:26,240
they make they make their money off of people's off of content creators stealing stuff from people of color, and then calling it their own and then making it popular. So take talk gets more revenue.

60
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,840
Oh, that's that's any platform. That's Instagram as well. That's that's any any that's Twitter. It's all

61
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,120
Don't be dismissive about it, though. It's a very big thing.

62
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm not being dismissive about it. Excuse me. I'm pointing out that this is a problem on every social media platform. It's not something that's unique to

63
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:48,200
My point was that tik tok has been very recently called out on it. And it's been big news specifically on them very recently.

64
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,520
Um,

65
00:13:50,760 --> 00:14:09,240
now I lost my train of thought, but people tend to just kind of endlessly watch tik toks, you know, one after the other. And I think Instagram is a very similar sort of thing like Instagram stories or whatever it is. And on Instagram, I know that you will see ads because I do

66
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:39,120
chuckle. I will often see these ridiculous looking game ads where I know I know the game is nothing like the ad, because there's a lot of those ad will show like, I don't know the the mafia guy stealing someone's stealing someone's girlfriend or something. And then they drive off together and they're being chased by zombies and all these ludicrous things. You know, the game looks nothing like it. But the stories. Oh, God, what was the other one? There was one where like Kathy Bates was in the ad, and it made all this news. I think we even talked about it on

67
00:14:39,120 --> 00:15:08,560
the show. And like, it's a fucking match three puzzle game. But the ad was so over that was like grandma's mystery mansion or something. I don't want to give the game free advertisement anyway. But like it's like these ads are so ludicrous. And they're telling you to tap to download the game, which I bet a lot of people don't do. Maybe some because the ads are so silly. But in tik tok, and this whole integration thing, I would imagine as you're endlessly scrolling tik tok content, you're going to come

68
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:38,200
across, you know, an ad or something, and it's just click here to play now. And I think that will probably be something that is what they're going to do is have it so you just click and play the game right now. But again, I think if the games aren't interesting, nobody's going to really care. I also, you know, one thing I see on again, it doesn't matter what the platform is, it's something that you know,

69
00:15:38,200 --> 00:16:07,760
it hits in one place, and it spreads everywhere is these filters, right? See it on Instagram, Snapchat, tik tok, they all have some version of it, where, you know, you see the filter. And it's like, I don't know what what Pokemon or what what Pokemon is my team. And it shows like six random Pokemon that go over your head, and you sit there and react to your team. And people watch that. It's like, oh, yay, I got a team I like or Oh, I got all pidgeys and rotatas. That's garbage.

70
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:37,440
You know, people will watch that stuff for whatever reason. Because we're bored. But what if there's a game somehow out of those filters? That's where I thought maybe it would go is that you you play the game and watch people react live to it. Kind of like twitches mo or YouTube's I guess a certain component of that. But I would I would think maybe there's something there. I'm surprised when I heard tik tok is getting into gaming. It wasn't just, oh, they're trying to throw games at it like

71
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:56,360
Facebook did like Netflix is doing all this stuff. I'm surprised it wasn't like they're trying to do something different with it. They're trying to gamify something they're already doing. But as pointed out earlier, all of these platforms all steal from each other. Anyway, so there's that. Let's see.

72
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:26,240
DJ Rama S and chat says, I like tik tok better when it was called vine. Honestly, yes. RIP vine ahead of its time. And I don't know how Twitter ran that out of business. But they sure did. Because right. Twitter bought vine, didn't they? Or my parents go though. There was that to Twitter ran that out of business, too. So I don't, I don't know what happened there. But no vine was great. But this it was okay. So I just said earlier, I love a quick hit joke. And that's

73
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:34,400
all vine was. You didn't have a lot of time on vine to set something else up. tik toks let you go longer. Instagram, Snapchat, they'll let you go longer.

74
00:17:34,400 --> 00:18:04,320
They just poked me for 10 minute videos. On on tik tok, you can do 10 minute videos on tik tok. No, they said they're they're rolling out 10 minute videos. Like I was in the five minute crowd. And I mean, really, all I put on there is just like, stuff I did in dead by daylight to advertise my channel. And then, like pinball stuff when I went to Golden State pinball Expo. But there's people who go on there to I don't even know.

75
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,760
It's, I don't think these people are very interesting. Like people show stuff. And I'm like, it's not very funny. But then again, I don't think a lot of people are funny.

76
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Um, yeah, tick, tick tock's hard for me to get into, like, and I just wonder, like, is this an age thing? I don't know. Tick tock doesn't, I don't see a lot of content from people I know on it. Like, at least if I'm doing Instagram, or Snapchat, although a lot of my friends don't really use Snapchat. But like, I see people I know, and their content, tick tock, I I'll see, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival. But it's like, I'll see that something Paula Abdul posted, she's great. One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival. But it's like, I'll see that something Paula Abdul posted, she's great. One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival

One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival

84
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:41,760
One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival

85
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,000
When you see her Horse and stuff, it's like, it's all thirst-trapped stuff

86
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:56,120
When you see her Horse and stuff, it's like, it's all thirst-trapped stuff Um, then, like her YouTube and Instagram is all pimple popping things Yeah, but it starts to learn what you like

87
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,760
Yeah, but it starts to learn what you like Don't knock it. I watch those too

88
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,600
those platforms start to learn what you're engaging with and then it keeps showing you more of that, for better or for worse

89
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,540
You know, that's what a lot of social media platforms do

90
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:15,220
do. So, um, bonds, double six says have never viewed seen

91
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,020
anything connected to tick tock. It's getting hard to escape. I

92
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,540
have a hard time figuring out the secret sauce with tick tock.

93
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,940
I have an account. I made one video because a local artist

94
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,500
friend was like, you should get on it and make a video. And so

95
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,740
we made a video together backstage to show. And I thought

96
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,700
it was I thought it was stupid. Like I like not it was not this

97
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,940
other artists. I made the joke or whatever. And I thought it

98
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,780
was stupid. It did get a lot of views for being a throwaway

99
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,420
video. And I was like, what the hell? You know, I don't

100
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,620
understand this thing. But I don't I don't know what content

101
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,860
to make for it. I really don't. So I don't know. Maybe I'll

102
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,820
figure that out someday.

103
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
I just some of these names people have

104
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,380
the names on tik tok.

105
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,660
Yeah, like Lord Panda waffles. I just saw that name just now. And

106
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,580
I think it's a great name.

107
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,180
That's Yeah, I mean, it is a great name. A lot of MMO is in

108
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,780
video games. You see silly gamer tags and stuff too.

109
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:12,940
I saw I saw a sassy pants. Give it a on in another game.

110
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,980
Well, they're a fake fake bitch. sassy pants, by the way, was the

111
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,860
name of my old Warcraft character for those who don't

112
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,060
know. Let's see Zen monkey 11 says the secret sauce is it

113
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,820
short and to the point. You don't have to be that short

114
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,180
though. Because I've, you know, again, you just talked about the

115
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,820
10 minute videos, the five minute videos. So yeah, be that

116
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,780
short. Like vine was short and to the point. I would say I've

117
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,180
definitely skipped past my fair share of tik tok videos because

118
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,940
too too long to build up. It's just like the same problem with

119
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,460
a lot of youtubes too because the first minute will be Hey,

120
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,900
everybody, welcome to my YouTube channel. If you want to keep the

121
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,180
channel going. Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe. And

122
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,500
today,

123
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,820
a lot of them though have chapter markers on them now

124
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,340
though. So that makes it better. That's good. We know I can skip

125
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,460
the sheer space ads.

126
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,740
See, bonds double six says at work now watching anime when I'm

127
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,780
not working at some gaming or just regular adulting things.

128
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,860
So all right. Yes,

129
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,300
enough though. I am that person who pulls up YouTube to watch

130
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,260
documentaries.

131
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,860
Well, there is I mean, there is no shortage of all sorts of

132
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,300
content on there. And there's some great gaming documentaries

133
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,780
on there too. Like, I think of the Final Fantasy 14 1.0

134
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,180
documentary that's on there. That's really good. You know,

135
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,020
like, I like stuff like Did you know gaming and you know, unseen

136
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,900
64. And I actually watched a really good one today about

137
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,900
Stephen King stint as Richard Bachman, where the name came

138
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,260
from, why he did it and about the controversy by the book

139
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,820
rage.

140
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,660
And it was a 20 minute video. And it gave the information and

141
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,260
it was actually a really good video. Those are the that's what

142
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,740
I go to watch is stuff that's going to teach me something.

143
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,180
Well, for better or for worse, a site like YouTube with the

144
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,100
search bar has everything. You know, if you need to know how to

145
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,900
fix something, their algorithm sucks. Yeah, they will show you

146
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,100
the same video you watched two months ago.

147
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,740
Don't you want to see it again? All right. So until we have

148
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,820
more, I guess that's all there is to say on Tick Tock getting

149
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,980
into gaming is that they're testing it. I just don't know

150
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,900
how much engagement they're really going to get with it

151
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,220
unless they literally just dropped the game right in front

152
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,500
of you as you're scrolling through all these endless things

153
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,140
as you're looking at Tick Tock, I don't know. So yeah, I would

154
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,660
have to like, you know, it. I don't know if they're doing

155
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,180
anything meaningful with it, aside from just like, okay,

156
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,980
we're going to advertise games on there. And then we'll split

157
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,860
the revenue with whatever you guys sell or make off of it.

158
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,500
Like, I don't know, I, I just don't see them doing anything

159
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,340
meaningful with it. So far, like the other platforms, I've tried

160
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,940
to integrate that stuff like Facebook and whatnot, haven't

161
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,940
really done too much. Yeah, it's like, we'll have this news

162
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,060
cycle. And then Oh, turns out, nobody's really engaging with

163
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,540
it. So yeah, isn't that kind of true about Facebook gaming, the

164
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,260
live streaming section to like, they, they, they'll get in the

165
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,580
news, because it's like, oh, they've got all these creators.

166
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,300
And as much as I don't really care for Facebook, but I also

167
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,820
realized, like, I have to check it every now and then, or I'll

168
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,020
miss people's major, like, I'll miss that people are getting

169
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:25,060
married, and that type of stuff. So I'll load it up. But like,

170
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,700
never, never do I see on my Facebook feed anything about

171
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,180
Facebook gaming. And you would think Yeah, I mean, I'm not

172
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,020
gonna watch it anyway. But you would think they'd be trying to

173
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,300
target me a little bit. It's weird. Anyway. All right. Well,

174
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,860
let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video

175
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,940
games that we have been playing this week, the things we've been

176
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,340
doing that aren't tick tock. How was your gaming week Dark

177
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,300
Soccer? We'll start with you.

178
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,980
Um, Terranigma is getting a little bit more interesting,

179
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,620
although it's like still a fairly simple game. Like, the

180
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,500
story is interesting, but it's so fucking weird. And like, I

181
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,580
did have something good happen, like in in my my last stream, it

182
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,660
was pretty cool. You have to go find this girl and they allude

183
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,300
that she's surrounding herself with illusions. And then when

184
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,260
you when you find her and you talk to the people in the town,

185
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,500
and everyone's nice and you lay down at the end, and you wake up

186
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,340
and there's all zombies trying to eat you and you can you can

187
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:36,100
shoot their heads off and tables fly at you. And you there's

188
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,740
these ghosts, like things that look almost like they almost

189
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,180
remind me of Jomon pottery. But if you hit them, these ghosts

190
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,380
come out and they like try they suck you back to the beginning

191
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,980
of the level. So I've been using my safe states a lot. And like,

192
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,460
you have to go find this girl's dog and all this stuff. And it's

193
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:01,260
just this weird sort of denial thing going on in her with her

194
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,460
little world of zombies. And I haven't found the girl yet. I

195
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:10,180
think I did something out of turn. But it's a it's a really,

196
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,540
the game has more depth than I thought it did at the beginning,

197
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:25,380
even if the delivery is a little bit. Hmm. Awkward. Awkward

198
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,540
delivery, I can put it forth like that, like you do. Like you

199
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,300
wake up this one thing like you wake up all the animals in the

200
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,820
world. And then suddenly you can talk to the animals and you have

201
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,940
this weird cutscene that doesn't make any sense. And I just a lot

202
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,900
of it just is really awkward. And I can see why it didn't come

203
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,820
out over here. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but I have

204
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:56,620
played better put together games in general. The music is is okay.

205
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,540
There have been some pieces that I translate them as really bad.

206
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,420
So they're interesting to listen to. Like the instrumentation and

207
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,420
some of them is weird. And I found some music I really enjoyed

208
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,140
and I like the animations for the main character arc. And I

209
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,940
like his little like, purple blob thing that just shows up

210
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,340
out of out of nowhere to be sarcastic to him named Yomi. So

211
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,620
I'm enjoying the game. It's just not what I expected it to be.

212
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,940
But it's it's pretty fun. I'm so I'm gonna keep up with it. I

213
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,540
mean, I think I'm kind of pushing through it at a good

214
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:43,100
pace. And of course, Dead by Daylight. I play I ended up

215
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,940
like I don't even know what my deal was yesterday, but I could

216
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:51,740
not play my best characters to save my life. And then I'm

217
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,020
actually starting to see now where I'm getting loading screen

218
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,180
lag that a lot of people on Steam are also getting and the

219
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,580
rubber banding that they've been talking about. Where it's like,

220
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,860
you you're chasing after someone, for example, and then

221
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,900
it snaps, like it snaps you back, like another position like

222
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,700
you've been pulled back by rubber band. And I don't know

223
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,060
what it is, because Finara and I were talking about it. And

224
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:24,100
Finara, I will be getting to that. Thank you. Is that the

225
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,980
toxic survivors, the bully squads have been out in force.

226
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,780
And although I did have something really funny happen on

227
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,580
Thursday, I finally got to play Haddonfield, which I haven't, I

228
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,020
haven't played it yet, except for the time Finara and I ran

229
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,540
around exploring. And it was clear, I didn't know where I was

230
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,820
going. And the survivors started to be, you know, bullyish and

231
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,300
everything. And as I like to say, they fucked around and

232
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:54,140
found out. They got sloppy, I got on my game. One person

233
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:01,300
disconnected to, to Death Hooks. And I felt sorry for the UE at

234
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,340
the end and I let her escape. I let her get the hatch. I

235
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,300
couldn't find the hatch though. That Haddonfield level is small,

236
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:13,380
but weird. I don't hate it. But I miss old Haddonfield and I

237
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,140
never thought I would say that. Yeah, it's very different. But

238
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,380
other than that, I've been watching people on the PTB. The

239
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,660
dredge, haha. That, that's a very interesting character

240
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,060
concept. And I super love it, except he just, he reminds me a

241
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:36,620
little bit of some of the scenes from The Thing. And that

242
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,180
is a movie I cannot watch because I had bad nightmares

243
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,660
about it. Like I cannot watch that movie and the dredge makes

244
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,980
me think a little bit of it. But the locker teleporting

245
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,500
mechanic is really cool. And now, you know, I'm a lore nerd.

246
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,380
I've probably read through everybody's stories and the

247
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,980
extra things. And I really liked that they brought Hattie into

248
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:04,060
it because she was mentioned in three other tomes before we even

249
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:09,060
saw her. And then there was like the Jacob person that she was

250
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,140
writing to also mentioned in the lore. And then I think there was

251
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:18,020
something about the person who basically created the doctor. So

252
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,820
I really think that now they're starting to look a little bit

253
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,820
more to their actual lore and starting to tie it all together.

254
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,140
Because I think that there's a big contingent of us that's

255
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,660
really into the lore. And we want to see these things, we want

256
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,740
them to expand on it. Well, I did also buy another game and I

257
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,700
cannot play it. I bought Evil Dead. Right now, now it's only

258
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:49,100
on Epic Games Store if you want it on a non console. And they

259
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,740
marked it down to like 39. And then they're doing like some

260
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,060
mega sale right now where you can get a $10 off coupon. So I

261
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,140
paid 30 bucks for the game. So I'm not going to return it. But

262
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,140
it won't run in Windows 11 arm. It doesn't the x64 emulation is

263
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,380
not where it should be to run that game. Of course, I still

264
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,460
have the same problem with Dead by Daylight that I know the game

265
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,540
will run. I know the game will work. It's the anti cheat that

266
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,180
they use that won't run and the game will not run without the

267
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:24,180
anti cheat. So I'm hoping that the Evil Dead comes out on

268
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,020
Stadia because I'll probably buy it again. It looked like I

269
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:34,180
watched LC play it last night. It was that shit. It's intense.

270
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,940
And it looked like it was a lot of fun. So I'm one of these days

271
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,460
I'll get to play it but I did put a lot of attention into it.

272
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,300
So that's right out in word scapes like I'm number 12 in

273
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,740
the tournament today. So whatever.

274
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:52,660
All right. Loki, we'll go to you. How was your gaming week?

275
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:59,140
I was just Minecraft again. So I put out a new hardcore video.

276
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:04,020
And then I've been trying to get a farm, a raid farm to work, or

277
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,540
at least a stacking rate farm to work. But the server that we

278
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,900
play on, it had its runs what's called paper MC and paper tends

279
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:17,100
to mess with technical redstone stuff. And so I built the farm

280
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,100
up and it didn't work quite right. So I had to tear it all

281
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,820
down again. And so now I'm researching new farm designs to

282
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:32,100
build. So there's that. Um, what else? Oh, I got this cool new

283
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,900
t shirt. I gotta show you. So you're gonna love this. I mean,

284
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,300
so check this out. See if we can move my mic.

285
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,220
Was that a pyramid head? I can't tell.

286
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,100
No.

287
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,580
Yeah, your green screen is green is the virtual green

288
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:45,980
screen.

289
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,540
Here, we'll fix that real quick. All right.

290
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,460
And by the way, can I mention one thing that I forgot to?

291
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,780
Yeah. I chased finara around in cold wind farm so I could

292
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,900
practice nurse. Oh, fun. And listening to a thing screen

293
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,620
makes me happy.

294
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,180
Oh, gosh, that's also okay. So that's like, that's the

295
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,940
background for dropout. The old DDR song. It is. Oh, wow. That's

296
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,020
that is. Where did you get that shirt from?

297
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,220
T Republic, I believe.

298
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,620
I'm gonna have to look at that. Yeah, that's, that's a throwback.

299
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,580
My gosh.

300
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:27,460
Yeah. Yeah. It was from they just sent me an email. I think

301
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,540
it's frontier public.

302
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,580
I'm a little shocked that I recognized it, but also not.

303
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,260
All right. Anything else?

304
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,780
I thought I had to get it. Anything else?

305
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,020
That that's basically it. Yeah. Okay.

306
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:45,500
Let's see. My gaming week. I've been playing more fun fancy 14

307
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,660
because of course I have been. I've been playing a little bit

308
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,420
of dead by daylight as well. I've been sort of trying to get

309
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,620
back into killer a little bit. I have found that I kind of

310
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,580
enjoyed playing the plague right now in dead by daylight. I feel

311
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,500
like she inherently counters a lot of the meta plays that

312
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,580
survivors use right now. Because like, healing circle of healing

313
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,900
doesn't really matter with her. Because her mechanic is the

314
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,100
whole cleansing and everything anyway, anyway, dead hard. You

315
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,820
can still vomit on them if they did hard. So there's there's a

316
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,780
lot that, you know, kind of works with her that I find very

317
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,060
fun. I just find most survivors aren't prepared for her. So

318
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,860
that's the fun thing about playing her not to say I got

319
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,780
some four K's I get some no K's just you know, kind of goes back

320
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,380
and forth. My luck with her.

321
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,340
He always used to throw me off because of how tall she is.

322
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,300
Oh, yeah, there's that. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Ah, let's

323
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,820
see. And then in other games, so I'm continuing my, you know,

324
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:47,460
adventures in AR gaming and like Pikmin. I'm level 57 in

325
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,020
Pikmin Bloom now. So I've walked a lot of steps. I just walked

326
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:56,180
three and a half miles today in the heat. So that's, that's been

327
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,540
you know, I don't know, because that's a very passive type of

328
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,980
game. I don't do a lot in that game. But they had a big

329
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,540
community day because Niantic had a big community day this

330
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,340
weekend. And actually, some of my friends through Ingress, we

331
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,460
decided to meet up in Oakland. Because well, they weren't doing

332
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,900
anything for Ingress, but we all play the other stuff too. So we

333
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,740
decided to do Pikmin there and they were doing Pokemon Go had a

334
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,100
community day. So they were doing Alolan Geodude as well.

335
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,020
Oh, yeah, Mike Defton chat says all the community days. Well,

336
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,540
Niantic Niantic starting to lean into that a little bit. And they

337
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,100
actually they even have a whole website for community day. And

338
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,300
they're they've launched a whole brand around it. So Niantic

339
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,740
actually had a booth in Oakland. And so it was it was considered

340
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,460
one of the like Niantic attended events. They did some

341
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,640
virtual events, but this was like Niantic intended, attended.

342
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,580
So they had a booth set up with like, it was just silly stuff

343
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,300
like pins, but one of the pins I got was a Niantic community day

344
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,460
pin with that new logo on it and everything. So I mean, they're

345
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,740
they're leaning into the brand. They had like Wayfarer stickers

346
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,500
and stuff. So you can kind of see all their their new products

347
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,380
are trying to kind of fold into their brand in different ways.

348
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,260
And then, yeah, so I did the community day there and just,

349
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,900
you know, walked around a little bit. It was interesting because

350
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:19,700
they had, they put in like 10 fake pokey stops right in that

351
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,500
Jack London Square, which is a pretty decently populated area

352
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,620
with pokey stops anyway. And they added like 10 more. So it

353
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,620
was like I was just sitting there because I use the Bluetooth

354
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,940
and when I ran out of pokey balls, I just switch it to only

355
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,180
spin stops. And within like 10 minutes, I probably had 100

356
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,980
pokey balls again. So it's also interesting. And we'll get into

357
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,420
some of the Niantic controversy later. But it is very

358
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,980
interesting how they can set up fake pokey stops whenever they

359
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,500
want wherever they want. So it's that part of it's kind of

360
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,220
interesting. But it was honestly like I it was kind of lame for

361
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,860
Pikmin though, because Pikmin didn't generate the flower

362
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:02,380
spawns. It didn't generate off the the stops that they made for

363
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,940
the event. So it was like there wasn't very many places to spawn

364
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,100
flowers. So it was really just Pokemon. And so for my friends

365
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,740
they play Pikmin and Ingress, they don't really play Pokemon.

366
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,140
They were a little bit like, there's not much to do. But it

367
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,500
was fun to see everybody and hang out together. And I guess

368
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:22,300
that's that's the fun in it. So yeah, so outside of that, don't

369
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,020
really have a lot else to share. I Oh, no, I guess I could

370
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,540
mention that Pokemon home got an upgrade. Because now Pokemon

371
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:36,020
home will work with Arceus and brilliant diamond shining pearl.

372
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,020
So all I've really done so far as I went into home to like

373
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,900
organize some stuff and do a little bit of transfers, I

374
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,180
upgraded my save files and did the transfers to get the bonus

375
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,460
Pokemon that they're given away for the home upgrade. But if

376
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,380
you're a Pokemon person, and you like home at all, just check out

377
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,460
that that all got upgraded to 2.0. And now you can use it with

378
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,260
the two latest Pokemon releases, because you can only use it with

379
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,180
really sword and shield and go and and transferring stuff all

380
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,620
the way from bank before you can really use it with the newer

381
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,380
games, but they've now patched it in. So you can use it with

382
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,780
the newer releases. So that kind of makes that stuff fresh again,

383
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:17,500
I really need to go back and beat Pokemon Arceus because that

384
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,340
was all right when I was moving. So I was really into it for like

385
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,300
a week. And then it was like the move took over and I never went

386
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,700
back to it. So I need to do that at some point. All right, let's

387
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,620
get into some more news. Not a lot of housekeeping stuff. But I

388
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:36,260
will mention because we're getting close now. We're only a

389
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,220
month away from our 20th anniversary here of Orange

390
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:43,340
Launch Radio, we celebrate 20 years on the air for better. And

391
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,660
for worse. At the end of June, June 26 will be that show are

392
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,540
technically our birthday is June 23. But that would be in the

393
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,380
middle of the week. So we're going to do a celebrate all that

394
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:59,460
on June the 26th. So be here. All right. Let's talk about news

395
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,220
and what else is going on in the gaming world. Loki?

396
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:08,500
Yeah, so apparently, the word is that EA is looking for somebody

397
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,460
to swoop in and purchase them. Because you know, hey, that's

398
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,100
what's happening.

399
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,540
So they said in recent years, as media companies have taken

400
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,940
greater interest in the rapidly growing gaming industry.

401
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,300
Electronic Arts have held talks with a number of different

402
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,540
potential suitors, including Disney, Apple and Amazon.

403
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:39,300
Several sources with these talks say EA has been persistent in

404
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:43,780
pursuing a sale and has only grown more emboldened in the

405
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,220
wake of the Microsoft Activision deal.

406
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:55,100
Yeah, but like, maybe they don't like don't have the offer

407
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,140
they're like your games like Battlefield hasn't been doing

408
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,640
well.

409
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,300
Madden stuff, I guess it's all right. You just lost your FIFA

410
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,100
license, or maybe just didn't renew your FIFA license,

411
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,620
whatever.

412
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,220
So I don't know. I don't know if anyone will will purchase them.

413
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:18,860
But I guess they're just saying, Hey, we're out here, waiting for

414
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,980
you to purchase us.

415
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,100
Well, that's the I guess that list of suitors is kind of

416
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,100
interesting. I mean, because they're not really companies you

417
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,340
think about with gaming. I mean, I get the Apple one I get

418
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,500
because I see where they've got gaming, the Disney one, I guess

419
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,820
Disney did have some game publishing.

420
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,260
Yeah, yeah, they're interested in more licensing than developing

421
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:48,060
their games. So so but then the Comcast one is very like, I

422
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:53,020
mean, a lot of people are quick to point out, you know, the two

423
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,860
most hated companies in America are probably Comcast and EA. You

424
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,500
know, if you look at those, you know, when when it comes to

425
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,540
battle for the Oh, who's the worst company in the world? It's

426
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,300
usually those two are towards the top of the list. So it was

427
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,500
just together we can be the worst we'll combine our powers

428
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,580
of being the worst to be the even worse company. I don't

429
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,180
know. I'm, I'm not sure how EA would fit into that unless

430
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,500
Comcast to be more worse or rare, unless Comcast wants to

431
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,300
start publishing games. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know where

432
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,220
that fits in with it. Well, it's not gonna happen anyway. But it

433
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,940
could it could be that they just want to be purchased and then

434
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,900
they could still be making games but just like owned by another

435
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,380
company kind of like how we just had the acquisitions with some

436
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,180
of Square Enix's properties, where they're owned by another

437
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,260
company now, then they're still making games. It's just they're

438
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,100
not making games for Square Enix anymore. There. There's another

439
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,420
parent company that basically owns them. Yeah, it'd be nice

440
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,460
if someone threw billions of dollars your way, but

441
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:58,300
unfortunately, that's not happening right now. Would it be

442
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,060
like a big deal if Sony purchased them?

443
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,700
Um, I don't know me No, I am. But yeah, probably.

444
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,260
Personally, it's gonna be different for everyone. Will it

445
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,740
make huge news in the industry? Absolutely. But it sounds to me

446
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,980
and especially kind of based on you know, the the feedback of

447
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,220
the EA feels emboldened by the Activision Microsoft thing. I

448
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:23,260
would bet EA is trying to ask for too much money for what

449
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,100
they're really worth. And you kind of are pointing out that a

450
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,860
lot of their longtime franchises are not exactly taking a turn

451
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,460
for the better. And as more and more people are getting burned

452
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,260
out on the whole loot box thing and you see more regulation with

453
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,620
that when EA says this is where we make most of our money. I

454
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,620
think buying EA could be a dangerous prospect for many

455
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,060
people right now, especially now that they just lost the FIFA

456
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,220
license. And although I think most of us that don't think that

457
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,460
they net Yeah, I think that they I think with FIFA, they're just

458
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,700
now just licensing the football clubs.

459
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,540
And if you let me get to the point I would have, but most of

460
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,820
the, you know, the the EA stuff, they'll be fine without FIFA, I

461
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,660
really do think they will be. But just the fact that they are

462
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,660
they lost that is not a great look, you know, for a company

463
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,660
that's trying to sell themselves. Now they can't say

464
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,300
and we've got FIFA license for it, because they don't have it

465
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,900
anymore. You know, so I guess I think they'll be fine. Those of

466
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,580
us that have followed the industry in those games for a

467
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,100
while. Yes, they've, they've partnered with other soccer

468
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,620
clubs. And I really think FIFA will probably lose more from

469
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,780
that deal than EA will, but that's that's on them. So yeah,

470
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,820
they'll be fine. But I'm not sure investors see it that way.

471
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,340
We got this other company Konami, they're gonna make a

472
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,900
soccer game. It's gonna be amazing. Oh, wait.

473
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,820
Talk about somebody who ought to be sold. But that's a whole

474
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,820
nother story, I suppose. So

475
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,780
I must talk about a company that doesn't have anything of value

476
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,300
anymore.

477
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,620
Uh, quest buster and chat says from what I've read, the game

478
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:01,020
industry will blow past 200 billion in revenues by 2024,

479
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,780
which could partially explain why a company like Comcast once

480
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,180
an in Vivendi specialty is entertainment media like canal

481
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,420
plus in France, but once upon a time they owned Activision

482
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,300
Blizzard. Yes, it actually was not that long ago, really. So

483
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,300
yeah, it's very true.

484
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,420
S2100. Matt says I could have seen it. The EA game console

485
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,100
presented by Comcast, a cloud gaming console that won't be

486
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,020
subjected to bandwidth caps.

487
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,220
I hate that idea so much, but I could see it.

488
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,140
For sure. So

489
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,260
thanks. I hate it.

490
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,740
Thanks. I hate it. Yep, pretty much. Yeah, we'll see. I mean,

491
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,100
if they decide to sell. But meanwhile, there's other stuff

492
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,180
going on at EA, right?

493
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,980
Yeah, so along with that consolidation,

494
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:55,380
with the losing or not renewing their contract with FIFA, they

495
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:00,060
are now having layoffs at EA Austin, where they're dropping

496
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,780
200 or more customer support staff

497
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,780
that have been helping out with stuff there.

498
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,580
Again, not a great Well, I don't know sometimes

499
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:14,220
cutting back. I hate I hate to say it that way. Because, you

500
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,660
know, these are people that lost their jobs and so forth. But I'm

501
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,020
just speaking strictly like the investor side of things. Those

502
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,020
sort of cutbacks make a company a little more lucrative to that

503
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,620
sort of stuff, too.

504
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,540
Yeah, basically, they're taking it from in house and they're

505
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,140
going to be using a third party, I guess,

506
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,940
which means 100% full stop guaranteed customer service is

507
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,340
only going to get worse. Absolutely, it will get worse.

508
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,340
Because if you think customer service doesn't do shit for you

509
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,900
now, when it comes to restoring old accounts, or you were banned

510
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,300
inappropriately, just wait until a third party does it that

511
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,980
doesn't even have the proper access to

512
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,420
they're going to Romania and India.

513
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:59,820
They Oh, this is gonna be garbage, like, good fucking luck

514
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,020
for those of you that have a lot invested in EA online games. You

515
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,180
know, I don't know, maybe if you if you're playing Star Wars,

516
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,940
the old republic or something that like you're continuously

517
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,060
hitting EA products, or maybe dropping a lot of money on FIFA

518
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,660
or what have you. Good fucking luck if you need customer

519
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:21,340
service help, because that's Oh, boy, that's gonna be rough.

520
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:28,500
Anyway, let's talk about a gaming series, the dark soccer

521
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,580
and I talk a little bit about on this show just a tad, a little

522
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,740
a little bit. So we're gonna talk a little bit about dead by

523
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,460
daylight. But that's because there's actually a lot of news

524
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,580
going on with dead by daylight is that they just had their six

525
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,140
anniversary celebration stream, you know, kind of announcing

526
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,780
what's coming up for the sixth anniversary event that's

527
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,180
happening in June, where dark soccer kind of already

528
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,460
referenced, you have a new killer, you have a new survivor

529
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,620
that are on the public test build right now. But did you

530
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,460
watch the whole thing?

531
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,300
No, I didn't watch any of it. I only read secondhand the cliff

532
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,020
notes. I watched all of it. Yeah, well, I was working so I

533
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,500
couldn't I couldn't watch it. But I watched it after the fact.

534
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,900
Okay, that's cool. Yeah. Um, but I did see this trailer and

535
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,380
something that came a little bit out of left field a little bit

536
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,020
not. But I think for those that hadn't been paying attention to

537
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,260
every little rumor, this did come out of left field. And that

538
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,740
is that dead by daylight is officially launching a dating

539
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:25,380
sim. And it's called hooked on you, which is a very tongue on

540
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,260
tongue in cheek name. Because of course, in dead by daylight,

541
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:33,020
if you're a killer, you are placing survivors on a hook. If

542
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,420
you're a killer, you're a hooker. Yeah. So hooked on you

543
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,020
is the name of the obviously there's that play on dating.

544
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,780
This is being made by psy op, who made the I love you Colonel

545
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,780
Sanders dating sim. So you know, this is a company that got a

546
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:53,460
pedigree. Yeah, they would. They're gonna do fine with it.

547
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:58,860
They interviewed the guy behind it. And he was absolutely

548
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,980
hilarious. He's like, Well, I know this is normally serious

549
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,180
and very lethal. And we want to pay respect for that. But let's

550
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:08,380
make it silly. It was it was actually really worth watching.

551
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:12,980
That's cool. Um, yeah. And it this is just funny to me.

552
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,500
Because if you go to the dead by daylight, Twitter, which it has

553
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,660
a weird name, you would think they'd just be at dead by

554
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,900
daylight, but it's like, D by behavior, so dead by behavior,

555
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,300
bh vr. Yeah. So you have to go to that Twitter. If you look at

556
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,500
the replies to literally any tweet they've ever posted, the

557
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,780
replies will always have in the one of the first five replies

558
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:38,540
will always be when are you adding sex to dead by daylight

559
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:43,820
or sex when or when can I sex Dwight or you know, David or

560
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:49,020
whoever is the killer or survivor being posted about. And

561
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,900
I feel like in a way as much as this daylight, or excuse me,

562
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,300
this dead by daylight dating sim is funny and good news. I feel

563
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,980
like it's rewarding that behavior on Twitter is that all

564
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,660
those people not a little bit not that you're gonna have sex

565
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,020
in this game, but I do feel that those people are vindicated a

566
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:11,420
little bit, which kind of irritates me. So but anyway, um,

567
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,660
on a murderer's island, we're hooked on you takes place, you

568
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,540
will get to know four of the killers in the game, the trapper

569
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:24,740
huntress, wraith and spirit. And you will romance them and

570
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,540
apparently might be wondering which survivor Do you play as my

571
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,500
understanding is you play as yourself. You don't play as a

572
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,900
survivor. So the survivors flat out you play as an original

573
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,580
character. Yeah. So the survivors may show up in cameos

574
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:39,740
or something, but you're gonna play as yourself. And it's gonna

575
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,780
be in a locker. Yeah. And there's, you know, there's men

576
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,580
and women. So it's a for four people. It's a pretty diverse

577
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,540
lineup there. It's all dead by daylight behavior entertainment

578
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,020
originals. So you're not going to be romancing Mike Myers or

579
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,060
Freddie or any of that stuff. But I'm sure we can all

580
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,740
understand why, you know, those licenses only go so far, they

581
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,340
would have to license those care. So if this dating sim does

582
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,540
really well, maybe we'll get nemesis in it because it seems

583
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,220
like Capcom is very eager to license right now. The one thing

584
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:12,300
we haven't talked about, they also confirmed a second resident

585
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,540
evil DLC is on the way, which getting Ada Wong, which has not

586
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,980
happened for with it. Technically, they haven't

587
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,900
confirmed that. But wink, wink, nudge, nudge, the leakers that

588
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,680
said this was coming said it's Ada Wong and Wesker. And the

589
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,620
trailer VD leaks has been fairly accurate. And the information I

590
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,900
mean, it's called project W and the trailer was just screaming

591
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,700
that it's Wesker. So I don't see Yeah, how Yeah, so I'm sure I'm

592
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:41,460
sure it is Ada Wong. It's a bummer. I don't I guess it's not

593
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,620
to though. It's just Oh, no, it is to it's somebody from

594
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:47,300
Resident Evil zero. It's another feet. Rebecca or something

595
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,460
right was the other way back chambers. She's actually was in

596
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,380
the first Resident Evil. Okay, okay. My bad. She was when you

597
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:57,420
played through Chris's game. She was his kind of sidekick back

598
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:02,940
and forth. And played the piano for that one scene and and she

599
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:08,900
was though in another game with was it Carlos? Some other guy.

600
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,260
Oh, she's also in zero says Mike Depp. Okay, so we're both

601
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:17,380
right. That's my fan. Um, it's I'm a little bummed that Chris

602
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,820
is not going to be a fully fledged character. He's always

603
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,380
just going to be an alternate Leon, but whatever. I guess you

604
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:26,980
can't win them all. So. But yeah, so there's another

605
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:31,140
Resident Evil DLC coming. Also, I really wanted the killer to be

606
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:36,580
Lady Dimitrescu. And I know I know Wesker. I know Wesker is

607
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,060
maybe a third one show. Yeah, maybe a third one since

608
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,900
apparently Capcom is, you know, bargain basementing that out

609
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,340
right now. But I imagine it's I imagine that DLC sold really

610
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:49,540
well. And it's probably done a lot for you know, people love

611
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:53,940
it. So I think probably sees the win there. Don't forget about

612
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,340
the other news with that they're going to be doing revamps to

613
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,700
RuPaul's Drag Station. Oh, the Raccoon City Police Department,

614
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,780
the worst map. Yeah, that needs that is not the worst map. It's

615
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,940
my favorite map to play on his pig and Freddie as the worst map

616
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,380
for a survivor, I think. Well, I don't know. No, a lot of

617
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,340
survivors love it because they it's like a terrible map for

618
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:15,700
because of the library. That's it because of the library. But

619
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,260
I love getting RPD as pig. It's like my favorite thing is

620
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:25,500
getting RPD as pig. So well, how do you feel that they're

621
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,900
reworking it? Because it might not go and, you know, I know you

622
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:32,380
love to do the extra trap and all that stuff to get survivors

623
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,100
in that map, but they may

624
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:38,820
did actually play this trap or two and it was pretty fun. But

625
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:45,980
I think that I want them to keep this original layout like they

626
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,340
have but if they do other maps that you have a chance to get

627
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:54,780
that maybe have different things restricted or different openings

628
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,620
or different pathways, you know, kind of like how there's like

629
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,780
what 50,000 versions of batam. Yeah. And they all are pretty

630
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:07,100
much the fucking same. I think this is gonna be more of that. I

631
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:11,580
honestly do. Oh, there's more pulsing shit everywhere. Oh,

632
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:17,060
this there's a tentacle in the wall. Oh, I'm so scared. Oh, no.

633
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,420
Oh, this one doesn't have the hole in the wall from the

634
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,700
helicopter. Ooh.

635
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,180
I would like to see another Silent Hill DLC. But I don't

636
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:31,340
know what other killer they could put. Because they made the

637
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,740
most obvious one a survivor.

638
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:38,380
I would want them to do like the original mansion. I know it's

639
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:41,380
too big, but I would like for them to do like different areas

640
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,780
of the mansion. Cool. Cool. From the first Resident Evil. And if

641
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:50,940
they did a Silent Hill one, I would want it to be the mall

642
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,660
that Heather is trapped in in Silent Hill three. It's just

643
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,860
the room Cheryl, Heather, Cheryl, whatever.

644
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,700
Now, um, I don't know if we have a release date for hooked on

645
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,820
you. We just know it's Oh, later this summer. That's what

646
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,020
we know. And that it's coming to steam. So I don't think we have

647
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:10,460
any other platforms yet. But you know, the going theory is July.

648
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,900
Yeah. Which would make sense. That's right around their

649
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,540
anniversary and all that stuff. Now, Loki, I know you don't get

650
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,460
into Dead by Daylight the same way Dark Soccer and I do. But I

651
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:23,380
have to ask, could a dating sim sell you on Dead by Daylight?

652
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:24,420
No.

653
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,740
Why not? You're no fun.

654
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:30,460
I don't really play dating sims. So that wouldn't really

655
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:34,180
maybe your wife would get into Dead by Daylight. Probably not.

656
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,300
All right. Dark Soccer. I'm sure you'll be sure I'm sure every

657
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,540
Dead by Daylight streamer you and I both know will be

658
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,700
streaming this but I'm sure you're going to stream it as

659
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:48,380
well. Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. All right. Coming whenever they

660
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,980
finish it, I guess. All right. In the meantime, I'm sure it's

661
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:54,100
pretty much done. What I want to do those I want to see it

662
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,820
actually be successful. So that they bring out more characters.

663
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,780
Yeah, DLC.

664
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:05,180
Do you remember when I was into the guy I can't remember what

665
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,140
company it was had the dating sim but I played all the

666
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:11,980
Homestuck characters. And it was all web based. And they took it

667
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,820
down. I was really mad and I paid for it too. Well, and if it

668
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,940
does, I can't remember the name.

669
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,500
I was just gonna say if it does well, DBD will probably cross

670
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,140
over into other types of games too. I mean, this

671
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,740
Namco Hi, thank you, Dark Tessa.

672
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:27,180
This is hot on the heels of the Dead by Daylight board game too.

673
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,540
So, you know, which I ordered this. And I think if that does

674
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,540
well, and this does well, I think you're just going to see

675
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,980
DVD as a franchise grow into other places too. Which could be

676
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,620
interesting.

677
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,620
Maybe Loki, would you play the Dead by Daylight board game with

678
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:47,260
us? Maybe I want to do a live play of the board game when mine

679
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:47,820
arrives.

680
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,940
I'll try it. Yeah, we could do that. I'll try it.

681
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,620
And I ordered the full set.

682
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,860
Do you think it'll get here before the 20th anniversary?

683
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:59,300
That would be awesome if it did. I know. polyester did a video

684
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,700
about the orders, but I'd have to check the site to see when

685
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,620
the they're planning on shipping. Okay. All right. I'm

686
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,380
excited about it.

687
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,660
Well, in the meantime, let's move on to a completely

688
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,300
different headline from dark Sakura.

689
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,700
Yeah, so, uh, you know, and this is actually coming in light of

690
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:21,940
all of this bullshit coming from faux news about, oh, we're gonna

691
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:25,780
blame, you know, video game violence, blah, blah, blah, blah,

692
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:31,500
blah, same shit, different year, you know, but there is a study

693
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:37,340
that's out. This is that children could have a boost to

694
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:43,020
their intelligence by playing video games. So the study was on

695
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:47,260
American children between nine and 10 years old who spent more

696
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,140
time playing that when they spent more time playing video

697
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:53,460
games, they experienced a significant increase in their

698
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:58,180
intelligence stores. When retested two years later,

699
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:05,500
amounting to an extra 2.5 IQ points above the average. They

700
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:11,780
said that basically, other forms of screen time were also tested

701
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,340
such as watching videos, chatting on social media, and

702
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,460
they had neither a positive nor negative effect on

703
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:21,300
intelligence. For the record, the the study had zero funding

704
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:25,220
from anyone in the video game industry. They said that they

705
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,540
they did not examine the effects of screen behavior on physical

706
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:32,740
activities, sleep, mental well being or school performance. But

707
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:37,700
when just testing intelligence, that was the result. And it was

708
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:42,340
across the board. Um, I'm going to actually read this this quote

709
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,780
on here. And this is actually from Torkel Klingberg, who is a

710
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:50,620
professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Karolinska

711
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:55,300
Institute in Stockholm. Our result, our results support the

712
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,100
claim that screen time generally doesn't impair children's

713
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,060
cognitive abilities, and that playing video games actually

714
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:04,300
helps boost intelligence. This is consistent with several

715
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,860
experimental studies of video game playing. So the analysis

716
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:14,420
was on more than 9000 boys and girls. And it was on a long

717
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,860
term study. Like I said, there were there were two years that

718
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:20,820
they were all retested. And when they were nine to 10, they went

719
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,780
through different psychological tests to gauge their general,

720
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:27,540
you know, mental capacity, what their level of intelligence was,

721
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:30,100
you know, they were also asked how much time they spent

722
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:34,380
watching TV playing video games and on social media. On average,

723
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:37,460
they spent about two and a half hours a day watching TV, a half

724
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,940
hour on social media and one hour playing video games. Two

725
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,740
years later, 5000 of the children repeated the

726
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:48,020
psychological tests, and that they showed that kids who played

727
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,100
more than the average hour of video games wound up with higher

728
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:55,420
intelligence scores than the kids who spent less time playing

729
01:01:55,420 --> 01:02:02,540
video games. And what they're thinking is that it provides

730
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:06,460
what what they're referring to as enriched environments, and

731
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,420
requires them to tackle tasks that they would not do every

732
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:15,180
day. For example, active strategy, planning, quick

733
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:20,580
executive decision making. The more that someone plays the

734
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:25,340
games, they build the neural pathways that establish the

735
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:29,860
their adaptation to those particular skills. And we know

736
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:35,100
that that's actually how the mind learns a skill is that it

737
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:38,540
forms a neural pathway that outlines this is how you do it.

738
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:43,380
I mean, it's where we get muscle memory from, for example, is

739
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,460
because that's formed that that connection with with the body to

740
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:53,980
just know how to do it. And another quote on here, who is an

741
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,940
associate professor of psychiatry, Charles R. Drew

742
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:02,380
University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles. That's

743
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:07,380
Dr. Anish Dubey, I think is how it's pronounced. But he says

744
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,380
that the more someone practices or plays these video games, the

745
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,460
more they reinforce the neural pathways involved in

746
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:15,380
accomplishing the objectives of the game. And those same neural

747
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,140
pathways may be involved in other types of real world

748
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,980
decision making that factor into our measure of intelligence.

749
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:25,740
Video games by design, require focus and attention to the

750
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,220
content presented and strategizing in the moment.

751
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:31,020
Whereas it's easy to watch something on television without

752
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,500
paying much attention to the content. If you watch a segment

753
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,260
on television and miss something you do not lose, and you can

754
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,580
still infer the missing parts based on the remaining

755
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:46,740
narrative. This would be harder to do in video games. So now

756
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:50,300
they're also talking about now of doing other studies where

757
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:54,060
they're want to find correlation between video game and mental

758
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:58,220
health after two years. And if it all if an improvement in

759
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:03,100
intelligence also correlates to better mental health. I have

760
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:07,460
learned that the smarter I get, more depressed I get, because I

761
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:11,740
understand that things are shitty. That that's just an

762
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:16,500
aside. But I mean, look at look at a lot of us, you know, how

763
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,260
many of us basically had a controller in our hand when we

764
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,500
were, you know,

765
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:25,620
little Yeah, I was gonna I was gonna say like, we all grew up

766
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:28,020
with video games. And I think we've heard for many years, you

767
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,780
know, video games are going to rot your brain. Yet most of us

768
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,300
that grew up on these games, we all turned out pretty

769
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,500
intelligent, you know, like, you know, and I don't know to what

770
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,620
extent the games are to thank for that. But they definitely

771
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:42,220
didn't rot our brains like we were told they were going to.

772
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:46,540
I would think it also depends on the genre of game that someone

773
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:51,100
typically plays. But definitely puzzle games, especially the

774
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:56,940
ones that are timed, and things like Pio Pio, or even Tetris,

775
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,380
you're learning your spatial awareness, along with quick

776
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:05,020
decision making. And then you have things that are like, like

777
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,620
people who play the strategy games, that's teaching to look

778
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:12,020
beyond an immediate circle and look for long term effect. You

779
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:15,620
know, at least that's what where I'm going with this part of it.

780
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,820
Those are just inferences that I've made.

781
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:21,140
I think many of us that grew up on video games played a variety

782
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,380
of games, you know, sure, we had our favorites, I'm sure, but we

783
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:26,220
played a probably a variety of games. I think it goes back to

784
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,420
you were talking about that, you know, the tasks are something

785
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:32,340
that these kids are doing, and that their brain is kind of

786
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,740
constantly moving, because the games are giving them these

787
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:37,300
different tasks. And probably, again, depending on the type of

788
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,420
game you're playing, it's in cases, yeah, is what sort of

789
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:44,300
tasks it is. Whereas I would bet the control group that didn't

790
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:48,700
play the games, probably was watching television, and just

791
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:51,940
absorbing whatever was being put at them. And there was no task

792
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,900
to complete, you're just absorbing someone else's story.

793
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,460
Now, if you want to argue difference between ambient and

794
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,700
active, well, now, if you want to argue that maybe kids were

795
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,820
going out and playing sports instead, or something like that,

796
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:05,740
then that's all fine and good. And that's probably really good

797
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:08,540
for someone's physical health. But you know, a good a good

798
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:12,260
coordination, sure, reflex time, but it's there's not a variety

799
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,460
of tasks the way there are in games. And you know that between

800
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:19,380
the strategy game and the the that would exercise your brain,

801
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,220
you're certainly getting the physical activity, but not the

802
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:26,100
I think, while there is a cognitive element that's

803
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:30,020
involved in playing a game, usually it's not the player

804
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:35,860
that's having to make the plan. It's the coach or whoever who's

805
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:40,300
looking over the thing, making the plan, and sending out the

806
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,340
players to do that. Now the player has to execute whatever

807
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:46,100
task that they're doing. And yes, there's going to be, you

808
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:50,820
know, like, I'll just use like, baseball, there's aiming,

809
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,780
there's spatial awareness, there's force, there's knowing

810
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:56,620
how to a little bit of physics involved in it, in it with

811
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:01,380
hitting directions and whatnot. But in the end, they have a

812
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,980
particular task that they're executing, and they're limited

813
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,500
within that task that they're executing. Same with football,

814
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,420
if you're given a play, you know that your job is to cover this

815
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:14,660
person's ass while they run with a ball, or your job is to take

816
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:17,900
said ball and run like hell and make sure that no one pounds

817
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:18,700
your head into the dirt.

818
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:22,060
I would think even with an individualized sport like

819
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:25,140
tennis, it's still, you know, you still have a tennis coach,

820
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:27,660
but who's teaching you how to play it, but you're kind of

821
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,620
going through the same motion, right? You're going through the

822
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:31,660
same motions, pretty much. And again,

823
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:34,180
Your end goal is the same every single time that you do it.

824
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:37,740
And I'm not knocking physical sports for kids. That's fine. As

825
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:39,500
long as you know, it's a positive environment and

826
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,020
everything, because we've all seen some scary shit at Little

827
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,900
League games. But as long as it's a positive and supportive

828
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,260
environment, I'm all for it. Because you know, I think a good

829
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,820
mix is probably the best, but I'm just kind of illustrating.

830
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:53,420
It doesn't have the same level of cognitive stimulation.

831
01:07:53,540 --> 01:08:00,260
The mental. Yeah, so it's just interesting. So I'm glad science

832
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:02,740
is out there to prove. I'm sure that won't matter to a lot of

833
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:05,260
people, but it's nice to still have some of the science and

834
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,580
studies behind it for sure.

835
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,060
It absolutely is. I'm going to send it to my mom and tell her

836
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,060
this is why I'm smart.

837
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:12,780
There. There you go. And I think that's what most people will be

838
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,940
doing with this article this week. Those of us like us who

839
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:15,860
grew up on games and

840
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:16,740
Hey, Mom, look,

841
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:19,780
we're told they were gonna rot our brain, or that I told violent

842
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:23,100
video games, we're gonna, you know, unwind us or whatever it

843
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:23,940
was. So

844
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:28,820
now I'm, I think that one other thing that that I would like to

845
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:31,940
see, and it's too late to do it now. Because I mean, of course,

846
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:35,660
those times are long past. But I would be interested to see how

847
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:40,500
earlier types of gaming, like, you know, growing up a pinball.

848
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:45,340
I, I don't think that and now keep in mind, I love pinball. I

849
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:49,220
love to play pinball. I think that you still have some of that

850
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:54,460
still same limited strategy that you wouldn't have in say, going

851
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:57,340
through a game where you're solving multiple puzzles and

852
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:01,860
working through a narrative. Yeah. And I hate to say it,

853
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:04,220
because I mean, there's there's some new pinball tables out

854
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:07,020
there that have a lot of good challenges and everything. But

855
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:10,780
in the end, it's flipper plus ball, you know, meets target.

856
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:16,020
All right. Well, let's move on to a game that has a lot of

857
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,580
people thinking right, Loki.

858
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:25,180
Yeah. So, you know, I think we've always been wondering if

859
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:28,300
there's gonna be a sequel for Death Stranding coming. And I

860
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,980
kind of figured that if there was going to be a sequel coming

861
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:35,340
for that, then I mean, we're gonna find out about it with

862
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:40,820
some sort of event starring Jeff Keighley. You know, I mean, we

863
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:43,940
have one right around the corner. So it only makes sense

864
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,860
if there was going to be an announcement that that might be

865
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:51,580
coming. But apparently, it's been sort of acknowledged by

866
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:59,020
Norman Reedus. Basically saying that, um, yeah, I don't know if

867
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:04,180
he's, you know, he's necessarily confirmed it, but

868
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:08,060
there's a lot of like, weird, like, tweets and stuff going

869
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:12,380
around, like, Hideo Kojima has got playing looks like action

870
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:15,460
figures and stuff like that. And then of course, you know, he

871
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,100
said, you know, quick, okay, so you've got a book going on,

872
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,220
you've got final season coming out, and then a spin off, and

873
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:27,260
you're filming Death Stranding, the video game. I'm saying, you

874
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,940
know, we just started the second one. And this was, I

875
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:33,900
believe, in an interview that he was talking about for the

876
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:37,420
upcoming book, The Ravaged. So he was talking about like the

877
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,340
stuff that he's working on right now. So

878
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:43,500
so he slipped. I mean, a lot of a lot of these pre work has to

879
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,780
be done in advance. He slipped. They're not going to sue Norman

880
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:49,300
Reedus over a broken NDA. They're not going to do it like

881
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,780
he probably didn't mean to spoil it. But he probably Norman

882
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,140
Reedus probably doesn't follow the industry because he's he's

883
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,140
an actor trying to do movies and that type of stuff. He

884
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:58,180
probably doesn't follow the industry close enough to know

885
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,260
there's a very specific timetable when you announce

886
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,900
things that it does. So he slipped up, you made a mistake,

887
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:06,780
whatever, like, it's just it. And nothing will happen to him

888
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:09,620
as a result. And you know, ultimately, now it's just okay,

889
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,660
well, that secrets out. But I would

890
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:17,380
I love the response. So once this news kind of came out,

891
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:23,020
Hideo Kojima posts, go to your private room, my friend. He has

892
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:27,620
like a bat, a picture of the bat with barbed wire. Yeah, yeah.

893
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,180
Yeah.

894
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:34,820
So Kojima basically confirming it. But what's weird about I'm

895
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:37,180
not shocked that there's a sequel to Death Stranding. I'm

896
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:41,220
not shocked about that. But a lot of talk with Kojima lately

897
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:44,140
has been what is he working on now? Isn't he working on a

898
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,580
scary game? Isn't there something kind of new that he's

899
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:50,700
doing? And you know, the IP silent hell that won't go away.

900
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:54,940
It would be weird if like all this time, it just turns out,

901
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:57,500
oh, he's working on a Death Stranding sequel. I'm not saying

902
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,540
that's bad, because Death Stranding was an interesting

903
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:03,020
game. And it came out at a really good time for that sort

904
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,300
of story. But it just it's just it would just be a weird

905
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,620
conclusion to all this Kojima mystery of the last few years.

906
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:13,780
It would be a little unusual. But also, you mean, what do we

907
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:16,860
do nowadays in the game industry? We we make sequels.

908
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:20,420
True. So well, and that's not to say Kojima can't work on two

909
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,620
things at once. And especially when we're talking about

910
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:27,260
designing for what is now current gen systems. I'm sure

911
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,300
they have to get all the motion capture of Norman Reedus locked

912
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:34,900
in way sooner rather than later to get him rendered. And in the

913
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:37,860
game, you know, if he's the primary character, again, they

914
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:40,860
got to get all that work done. I mean, this game could still be

915
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:44,660
years out. And he's involved now. Absolutely. There's no

916
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,740
reason why that can't be the case. So it's not to say Kojima

917
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:51,100
can't work on two games at once. It's just, I don't think

918
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:54,580
this was the one they plan to announce at Keeley's next event.

919
01:12:54,900 --> 01:13:01,140
So probably not. Yeah. Let's see Questbuster in chat says on the

920
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,780
other hand, Reedus might be playing Kojima's long PR game

921
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:09,020
like a damn fiddle. Maybe suggesting that there was a

922
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,780
little bit of malice, maybe playful malice. I don't think

923
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:15,220
yeah, Reedus is in the interest of actually hurting Kojima.

924
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:19,780
He's still not dressing up in full was it full body cast

925
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,180
makeup again.

926
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:26,100
But you know, I could see that maybe he trolls Kojima by

927
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,980
announcing it early because like, what's gonna happen? What

928
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:31,140
are you gonna do? So what people know about the game early? So

929
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:35,340
what when you get do stab me? Yeah, big game get sequel. Tell

930
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,900
me something I don't know. But I think for a lot of us that you

931
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:41,540
know, follow the releases about. It's just I think I guess I can

932
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:44,260
really only speak for myself. I'm surprised that Death

933
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:48,220
Stranding sequel would be next potentially. I just thought

934
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:51,660
there was something else happening. But there's it's it's

935
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:55,580
also very possible something else got canceled. It's happened

936
01:13:55,580 --> 01:14:03,380
before. So who knows? All right, moving on. Let's talk about what

937
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:07,420
I think is very interesting with this whole PlayStation. You

938
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:11,460
know, the PlayStation Plus is getting redone. And we actually

939
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,460
know what some of the PlayStation Plus releases are

940
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,660
going to be we know what some of the classics are that when

941
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:19,500
the service rolls out in on June 13. For the Americas. I think

942
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,940
it's even sooner for Japan. I think Japan gets it this

943
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:26,180
weekend. So we know some of the classics. So we know that for

944
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:30,140
example, PlayStation one and PlayStation portable. These are

945
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:33,500
the classics you will get if you subscribe to that highest tier.

946
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:40,260
ape escape, hotshots golf, IQ intelligent cube, jumping flash,

947
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:44,700
siphon filter, super stardust portable, Mr. driller tech and

948
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:51,340
two worms world party worms are Armageddon. And that's it 10

949
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:57,340
games. Now, I'm not saying that list is bad by any means. But I

950
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:00,820
know when I heard this news, I was like, wait a damn minute.

951
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:04,220
Didn't they say in their press release, they were going to have

952
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:10,140
up to 350 classic games that were playable. Now, sure, I see

953
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,980
that there are PlayStation two games and PlayStation three

954
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:19,300
games. Sure, you add it all up, it's maybe 50. It's not 350. So

955
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:22,860
I guess maybe it's a long game. And many people on Twitter when

956
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:25,300
I made a sassy tweet about this many people on Twitter were

957
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:29,500
quick to correct me and say, this is a first look list. This

958
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:33,500
is a preliminary list. This is not the finalized list. Okay,

959
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:39,020
counterpoint. This is out next week in Japan. The time for

960
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:44,220
first look is past. This is now the time for a deep look, an

961
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:47,340
intimate look a further look, because this is what they're

962
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:52,380
trying to get people to buy. And if it's 10 games, that's not my

963
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,540
first now here's where I'm going to start to kind of scale back

964
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:59,820
my reaction. Because when I heard this list on Monday, I was

965
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:04,540
like, that is sad. That's sadder than what Nintendo launched

966
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:07,460
their switch online with and you see how much shit they get for

967
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:13,420
that, right? That is the 10 for the PS one. That's sad. But then

968
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:18,340
a second part of this came out where I'm like, Oh, this is why

969
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:23,380
it's only 10. And that is that the PS classic games are going

970
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:27,620
to now have trophies. Remember, they didn't have trophies near

971
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:33,820
the PlayStation one. But a tweet where Ben studio shared a clip

972
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:39,140
of siphon filter showed a new trophy and explosive start

973
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:44,620
available in the PlayStation one classic. And Ben studio actually,

974
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:47,260
the design manager there, Eric Jensen said in a tweet

975
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:51,460
responding to a fan, he helped out with a few of the trophies,

976
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:54,980
mostly naming. And there's apparently a platinum trophy

977
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:57,540
called excellent work agent, which assumably would be what

978
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:01,900
you get when you unlock all of the other trophies. Ah, so this

979
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:05,660
explains now it's just trophies. And you know, some people may

980
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:08,540
feel stronger about trophies than others. But now I

981
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:11,300
understand why it's taken so long for them to because now

982
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,460
they're actually having they're not just slapping an emulator on

983
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:18,100
it and putting it out on the service Nintendo. But they're

984
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:21,820
actually going back and trying to add more flags for trophies

985
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:25,900
and maybe other stuff too. We'll see when it comes out. Maybe some

986
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,100
types of filtering. I don't know. But I'm not really

987
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:32,460
counting on any of that. I still think it was wrong of them to

988
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:37,860
promote 350 games. Even if that is their plan to get there in

989
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:41,220
three years. That's not where they're at this week when it

990
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:47,100
launches in Japan. So I don't know. We'll see. I don't know

991
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:50,700
when you hear about all this. The 10 games and all this stuff.

992
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:53,500
I'm looking at chat now. Finally, Bobby Blackwell says up

993
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:57,580
to 350 games. Yeah. Okay. I think we all know the use of up

994
01:17:57,580 --> 01:18:02,860
to was a little little bit of a stretch here. Just a tad. Just a

995
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:06,660
tad. Um, Mike Deaf says trophies for PlayStation One games is

996
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:12,460
pretty cool. Yeah, it is pretty cool. Let's see. And Mike Deaf

997
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:15,100
says we're also not paying around $80 a year for the

998
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,300
PlayStation Plus service. And not to mention that even Nintendo

999
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:23,020
was criticized for having so little games in the service. I

1000
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:26,020
thought you were paying $80 for the highest level PlayStation

1001
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:29,020
Plus. Isn't it something like 120 a year or something like

1002
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:32,980
that? So I don't know. Anyway, I could be wrong. I don't have all

1003
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:35,740
that. The PlayStation Plus, unfortunately, it's a little

1004
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,900
complicated. And I don't have the chart in front of me right

1005
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,700
now that shows how much every level costs. But I'm not I'm not

1006
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:44,020
sure these 10 games are worth it to me to get the highest level

1007
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:47,460
of PlayStation Plus. I was already a little bit like a but

1008
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:50,740
now after seeing this list, I'm like, Nah, I don't want it. I

1009
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:51,260
don't need it.

1010
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:55,660
It's just our stupid PlayStation Now stuff. I just don't I'm not

1011
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,900
interested in that stuff.

1012
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:03,740
Yeah. Dark Sakura trophies. Do they matter? Is it incentive? Or

1013
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:08,340
nah? No. No. And I think that just depends on the gamer. Some

1014
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:12,100
people love the trophy chase the trophy hunt. I would love to see

1015
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:15,220
something like trophies in the Nintendo collection. Not that I

1016
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,460
would necessarily want to chase them all. But I think it would

1017
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:20,700
be fun to have like your little digital certificate, your

1018
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:24,340
digital badge, your little proof that yes, I beat Metroid without

1019
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:26,780
using codes or whatever. Kid Icarus will be even bigger one.

1020
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:29,460
I beat Kid Icarus without using codes or whatever it is. I think

1021
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:34,660
that would be fun. But I also don't count on Nintendo to get

1022
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:37,740
by that there was another Reggie interview that came out where

1023
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:40,100
somebody asked him why did Nintendo take so damn long to

1024
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:43,180
come to the table with online? And it's the answer most of us

1025
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:47,380
had assumed for many years. Japan didn't understand that

1026
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:50,620
that that it was more of a need in the US and Europe is basically

1027
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:54,580
extremely paraphrasing what Reggie said. You can go look at

1028
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:57,500
that up for yourself if you want. But yeah, just on a

1029
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,220
related note, continue to drag their feet on that, I guess.

1030
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,380
Mike Deft says, Yeah, I think it's over 100. But it's

1031
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:09,300
different in Mexico and Latin America or Mike Deft is that

1032
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,660
than it is for the US because they don't have PlayStation now

1033
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:14,980
there. And that is true is that, you know, a lot of countries,

1034
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:18,180
notably Australia, aren't going to have the same type of

1035
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:20,420
PlayStation Plus because they can't do the cloud streaming.

1036
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:23,460
For whatever reason, it's just not built to support that the

1037
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,140
infrastructure of Sony in those countries or whatever.

1038
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:27,820
Interesting.

1039
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:33,700
All right. Meanwhile, there's a very interesting headline that's

1040
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,420
getting a lot of attention Dark Sakura.

1041
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:42,300
Well, um, we actually brought this up kind of last week, I

1042
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:48,100
think talking about Xbox and how they're selling in Japan. And it

1043
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,220
turns out that for the first time in eight years, the Xbox

1044
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:56,620
has outsold PlayStation in Japan this past week. The Xbox Series

1045
01:20:56,660 --> 01:21:08,140
S alone outsold the PS5 and PS5 digital edition by about 3,

1046
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:16,940
3,800 units. So however, I mean, it's it's a rare occurrence. And

1047
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:19,860
I think that some of this has to do with system availability and

1048
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:27,100
whatnot. So one other thing also to keep in mind, too, is that it

1049
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:31,140
hadn't had the best support by Microsoft in in Japan before, but

1050
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:38,020
now they're having a lot more successful series of sales with

1051
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:45,740
this particular system. Simply because of the rollout of Game

1052
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:52,900
Pass for both console and PC in Japan in April 2020. So they've

1053
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:57,180
seen a lot more player activity than any other time in Xbox

1054
01:21:57,220 --> 01:22:01,940
history in Japan. And that they're also thinking that the

1055
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:06,700
acquisition of Tango Gameworks is going to be a very big step

1056
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:11,660
toward achieving a better market share in Japan. Phil Spencer is

1057
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:15,980
actually saying that they intend to take better care of Japanese

1058
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:22,820
players and and really make sure that they have, you know, they

1059
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:25,820
have a place in that aspect of the gaming industry that their

1060
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:28,020
their needs are being catered to that games are coming out that

1061
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:33,660
they'd want to play. I think it's I think it's good. I mean,

1062
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:39,620
yeah, it could be due to availability, but it is what it

1063
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:41,140
is. It's actually worth mentioning.

1064
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:44,420
Yeah, no, for sure. You know, and last week there. Yeah,

1065
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:49,660
right. This topic came up last week. There was no fact behind

1066
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:52,940
it to back it up until what we have here tonight. But we had a

1067
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:55,380
caller on the show last week who said, you know, I was saying

1068
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,980
the Xbox is a non factor in Japan. And that's just the way

1069
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:00,100
it is. And somebody said, No, it's wrong. It's selling. Yeah,

1070
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:04,220
I was wrong. I commit that I whoops. And this this headline

1071
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:07,340
sure, sure made a humble person out of me. It is what it is.

1072
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:12,660
Now, I, again, I think this just makes a nice headline because,

1073
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,820
yes, and I agree with Zen monkey 11. And Chad is saying, that's

1074
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:18,660
because people can't find PlayStation fives. It's not like

1075
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:23,260
they sold, I think a better, a more impactful headline, I guess

1076
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:27,540
would have been if the Xbox sold a lot of units, you know, out

1077
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:29,540
of but they didn't, they still didn't sell all things

1078
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:33,980
considered that many units, but I didn't think they were hardly

1079
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:37,100
selling any. And apparently, Microsoft is starting to catch

1080
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,940
on in Japan a little more again. And now you kind of

1081
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:43,380
brought up game pass. I know undertale recently got

1082
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:46,260
localized to Japanese audiences, I think. So I think there's just

1083
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:49,580
a lot of stuff now that probably game passes leveraging. And I

1084
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:54,820
think that it's interesting that it's the Xbox s, and not the x.

1085
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:59,780
So it's, it's probably that lower price for the s, combined

1086
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:03,020
with the fact that it's a game pass system. And it's it's

1087
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,780
turning some heads in Japan. I still don't think it's, you

1088
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:09,460
know, I think we put the lifetime sales next to Sony and

1089
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:13,500
Nintendo, it's still not where you know, a competitive system

1090
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:17,540
ought to be. But this headline certainly shows that there's

1091
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:21,420
potential there for Microsoft to grow. And maybe all is not lost,

1092
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:25,620
I would say with Microsoft in Japan, as I had assumed last

1093
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:30,480
week. So props to Phil Spencer on that victory and that

1094
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:34,700
headline, even if maybe a chip shortage was to thank for it. In

1095
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:37,540
part still, I think the fact that they sold as many as they

1096
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:42,100
did is still a long way from where they were even what 510

1097
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:47,100
years ago. All right. Well, moving on, Loki.

1098
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:53,960
Yep. So speaking about Xbox, there's this cool new patent

1099
01:24:53,980 --> 01:25:00,020
that is coming out, talking about how I don't know if this

1100
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:03,860
necessarily goes back to when they announced the Xbox one and

1101
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,700
that type of stuff. But remember, that was supposed to

1102
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,700
be almost like a digital only console at one time, but now

1103
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:10,780
they have a way that they're saying they're going to be able

1104
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:17,820
to validate your physical media to unlock digital copies of the

1105
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:21,220
game. So if I have like a physical version of, you know,

1106
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:25,160
Grand Theft Auto four, something like that, then somehow, it'll

1107
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:29,500
be able to scan that disk and authenticate a digital copy of

1108
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,460
the game for me since you know, they may in the future not be

1109
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:36,980
able to play those games on the drives that they have, like the

1110
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:39,180
Blu-ray drives might not be able to handle it or something like

1111
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:43,220
that. So I'm not necessarily sure how it's going to work. But

1112
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:45,460
sounds interesting.

1113
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,540
I can tell you it's gonna work. Jason outlined it a little bit

1114
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:51,680
in the intro. Well, we don't know for sure. But I'm, I would

1115
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,100
guess absolutely, they're going to leverage Windows 11. They're

1116
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,260
going to leverage Windows 11. And what they're going to do is

1117
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,200
they're going to build something into that that will decrypt the

1118
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,380
Xbox disks the same way the system does. And it'll know Yep,

1119
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:05,140
this is a valid copy of this disk. And while you're signed

1120
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,900
into this account here on your PC, and the disk is in the

1121
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,300
drive, we know you have the game and now it's available on your

1122
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:14,380
Xbox in your account. That's, that's, I would bet that's what

1123
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:16,540
they're going to do is they're going to leverage, you know, the

1124
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:19,100
market share of Windows 11 to make that happen.

1125
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:23,920
Hope it's not I hope I don't need a disk drive in my computer

1126
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,020
to be able to

1127
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:28,620
true because we're starting to see less and less of those are

1128
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:34,180
as most nobody has, you know, optical drives anymore. I still

1129
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:34,820
have one.

1130
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:41,460
You would be surprised. Trust me. I hear about it all the

1131
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:44,060
time. There's trust me, there's annoying

1132
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:48,420
still a lot of people that kind of rely on it for I have these

1133
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:53,180
old photo CDs, or I have drivers that you know, what if I don't

1134
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:55,620
have internet and I need something, you know, like, the

1135
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,300
drive now is just for backup purposes, even though Yeah, I

1136
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:01,980
guess a USB drive can also be, you know, a big thing. But you

1137
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:07,900
can also get a drive, you can get a DVD drive, that is USB, or

1138
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,940
Blu ray drive that is USB if you really wanted it.

1139
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:14,380
So but without outing where I work,

1140
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:20,180
I get plenty of I need to burn this Blu ray disc, I need to

1141
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:24,520
burn this DVD, and it needs to be a video disc. And there are a

1142
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:29,040
lot of people who are still using it as an active media

1143
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:29,800
trade source.

1144
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,760
A lot of folks in chat are kind of lighting up about like Bobby

1145
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:37,600
Blackwell says you can't get a gaming PC case with a drive bay

1146
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:41,640
anymore. DJRMS says I want to buy a new PC case, but so many

1147
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,240
new and fancy ones do not have spots for optical drives. Well,

1148
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,560
I guess I'm giving away how old my computer is. I am looking to

1149
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,480
replace it. It's a few years old at this point. But yeah, and not

1150
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,680
that an optical drive is something I'm looking for. But

1151
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:55,400
this is a very interesting patent that might change that

1152
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,800
conversation a little bit where I'm like, Oh, maybe I want an

1153
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:01,200
external USB drive. I mean, we'll see. And then someone else

1154
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:04,040
in chat, I think as Joe and under Matt said, not gonna lie, I

1155
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:08,200
wish Sony had this patent. It's not to say Sony couldn't do it.

1156
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,980
They'd have to pay Microsoft to do it at this point, but they

1157
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:15,760
could do it. And you might kind of laugh at that prospect. But

1158
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,760
how does Microsoft have the Blu ray player? Because guess who

1159
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:23,080
has a stake in Blu ray right now. So Microsoft has to pay

1160
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,440
Sony to have a Blu ray player on their device. There could be an

1161
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,400
interesting exchange there. Hmm.

1162
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:32,400
But bear in mind, though, a patent does not reflect reality.

1163
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,860
That is true, too. There's patents for things all the time

1164
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,000
that never end up happening. And yeah, lots of that stuff, or

1165
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,600
they change significantly and so forth. Absolutely. But it is

1166
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:48,120
I'll give you an example. Sega VR. Mm hmm. They had working

1167
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:52,440
units never came out. Well, partly because they were causing

1168
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:56,040
migraines because the sync between player movement and

1169
01:28:56,240 --> 01:29:00,720
backgrounds would disconnect and gave people seizures. But that's

1170
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,240
another story.

1171
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,880
Pod culture and chat says yeah, Microsoft back to the wrong

1172
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:09,560
format in that war. I they didn't have a choice. You know,

1173
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:13,320
again, Sony had a stake in Blu ray. So they weren't going to

1174
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,520
especially you know, when it was about being that definitive

1175
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,080
living room device, they were not going to use their pay their

1176
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,820
competitor to they were going to leverage HD DVD. The mistake

1177
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:26,960
Microsoft made was not having HDVD players in every single

1178
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,600
Xbox that was that it was a separate accessory. That was the

1179
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,600
problem because that's how PlayStation made DVDs as

1180
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,400
impactful as they were is that they were on every PlayStation

1181
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,160
two they sold was also a DVD player. And you got to think way

1182
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:43,520
back that's how DVDs became the thing was the PS two. And then

1183
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:49,080
how to Blu rays win that war PlayStation three. So it's Yep, I

1184
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:52,380
think my I just say, you know, yeah, yeah, Microsoft did back

1185
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:55,680
the wrong format. I would just say they didn't have a choice. I

1186
01:29:55,680 --> 01:30:00,800
think it's just the poorly timed implementation that didn't work.

1187
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,960
And you know, and by the time it was about the Xbox one, while it

1188
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,080
was done, the victor had been decided porn went to Blu ray and

1189
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:14,940
it was over. So interesting, Bobby Blackwell says one of the

1190
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:18,720
reasons they backed HD DVD was because they wanted both to

1191
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:22,040
lose. So streaming and digital would win. Ah, that's also

1192
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:28,920
clever to split the market. Perhaps. All right, let's move

1193
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:33,200
on. Let's talk about a game I've played a little bit here in a

1194
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:38,600
little bit thereof. It's Pokemon go and Pokemon go who boy. You

1195
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,320
know, I feel like every other month on the show, we're talking

1196
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:44,480
about Niantic made a change and their player base doesn't like

1197
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,520
it. Well, guess what? They did it again. They made another

1198
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,840
change and the player base doesn't like it. And it has to

1199
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:55,920
do with scaling back the remote raid passes. So they were giving

1200
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,960
away remote raid Pat. Well, they weren't giving them away. But it

1201
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,920
was they were giving away because they were doing these

1202
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:05,960
one pokey coin bundles every week was giving you a remote

1203
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,720
raid pass. I don't know when they started that. But it wasn't

1204
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,400
more than a year ago. This wasn't something they started at

1205
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,740
the beginning of the pandemic. But they started doing it about

1206
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:17,800
a year ago, I would say is when they started giving away those

1207
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,760
remote raid passes. And they said they were going to do it

1208
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,960
every week in the in the bundles. Well, they're going to

1209
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,160
stop. They're not going to give you remote raid passes for free

1210
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,280
and bundles and or you know what I mean for one coin, which is

1211
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:37,840
practically free. So that's gone. And as they did that, they

1212
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:42,440
have upped the cost of the remote raid passes in a bundle

1213
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:46,280
anyway, most people were by a one remote raid pass will cost

1214
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:50,880
you 100 coins. Three used to cost you 250. But you got that

1215
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,920
discount, right? Guess what three now cost you 300. So there

1216
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:59,200
is no point to buying those raid passes in bulk. And that was a

1217
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,900
change. They just made it. It's already live in the game. It's a

1218
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:07,360
done deal. And yes, you can earn coins for free in the game. If

1219
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:13,040
you do the gym meta, but you can only earn 50 coins a day. So you

1220
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,840
don't you can't remote raid every day. You can only remote

1221
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:20,680
raid twice a week, basically. So or, you know, once every other

1222
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:24,480
day, I don't know anyway, what they're also trying to do. And

1223
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,720
basically, why is it that they're doing this? Because

1224
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:31,440
America has decided COVID is over and they're just following

1225
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:35,920
suit. Notice how I phrase I didn't say COVID is over I said

1226
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:41,720
America decided COVID is over. There's a big difference. Niantic

1227
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:47,040
is also trying to push people to raid in person again, by getting

1228
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:51,400
the rewards for in person rating to be sweeter. So you get more

1229
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:56,440
not just rare candy when you do those raids, but you get rare XL

1230
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:59,800
candies, which are very hard to come by. I don't think anybody's

1231
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,640
upset with that change. Plus, you know, it Pokemon go rating,

1232
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:07,000
either everybody's sitting in their own car and doing it that

1233
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,860
way. Or at least it's outdoors. And you don't have to really be

1234
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:12,120
close to people to do it. You know, I've done plenty of my

1235
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:15,480
remote or excuse me, plenty of my own Pokemon raid in the day.

1236
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:18,400
And I would see even in the era of COVID. It's a pretty safe

1237
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,320
thing to do compared to most things. However, I just think

1238
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,520
what kind of sucks here. And I think what a lot of you know,

1239
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:29,000
the players don't like is that it's not that they're just

1240
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,120
adding something. It's that they're also taking something

1241
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,400
away with no warning. I think if they have just added the

1242
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,240
incentives to get out there and do it in person, then they would

1243
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,160
motivate more people to go out there and do it in person,

1244
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:44,320
especially the XL candy, but to take away with these remote

1245
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,240
raids. And I think it's just a matter of time before they flip

1246
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:50,480
that switch if they didn't already. But remote raids are

1247
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,960
supposed to be weaker. You're not supposed to be able to do

1248
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,920
as much damage in remote raids. So even though today you might

1249
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,600
be able to take out what a tapu fini I think is the latest

1250
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,840
legendary that's in the game. You can take that out with four

1251
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,760
people in a remote raid. You're not supposed to be able to do

1252
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,560
that. It's supposed to be weaker. And I imagine it's just

1253
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:10,760
a matter of time before they flip that switch too. So yeah,

1254
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:13,880
and Mike Defton chat says yeah, Niantic lack of communication

1255
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,840
toward the player base is what hurts the game more than

1256
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,000
anything. And this is the part where we sit here going. They

1257
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,920
just supposedly learn their lesson. Like not even three

1258
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:28,200
months ago, when we had this whole discussion about changing

1259
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:32,120
the radius of the pokey stop, and they they tried to shrink it

1260
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:35,440
back to 40, which would match what Pikmin and Ingress have.

1261
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,880
But again, because you're taking something away that you put in

1262
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,680
there and you I think they had kind of said would always be

1263
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:45,720
there. The player base lost their fucking mind and held

1264
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:49,520
their feet to the fire over it. And they had to reverse course

1265
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,920
and say, we'll listen in the future. We'll listen. Well, this

1266
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:56,680
just shows they're not listening. And that's what's

1267
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:01,360
incredibly frustrating for some people. Now, I don't know how

1268
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,640
many people are going to go to the great lengths that are

1269
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:06,520
necessary to really make your point and delete the fucking

1270
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:11,520
game. If it's that. And I will say our own Pokemon nerd resident

1271
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,200
nerd Shane who's come on the show several times. He's told me

1272
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,600
he's deleted the game from his phone and he's done with it.

1273
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:22,880
Like between this, the reduced incense spawns living in a rural

1274
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,000
area. He's just like, Pokemon go just isn't for me. And he

1275
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,200
deleted it off his phone. So I mean, it'll take a lot of people

1276
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,520
to do that. I think for Niantic to really shape shift their

1277
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:41,240
shift course and do that whole thing. So but in the meantime,

1278
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:45,880
let's see what are some other comments here? Oh, there are new

1279
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,920
social features that are supposed to be coming to the

1280
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:52,840
game in the next few months. Oh, yeah. I got an invite to a

1281
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:57,000
Niantic social app. So it's interesting because the whole

1282
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,680
social stuff is already built into ingress. But I guess

1283
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,120
because I'm an ingress player, maybe they even know I'm a

1284
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:06,160
heavy user. I don't know. I got invited through because you

1285
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,680
know, it's not it's not quote unquote, easy to beta stuff on

1286
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:12,480
an apple compared to Android because on Android, they just

1287
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,440
kind of put it up as a beta but an apple you have to be invited

1288
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:18,600
by the publisher to something called test flight in order to

1289
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,920
be able to attest and that's what I got through Niantic is a

1290
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:26,120
test flight version of the Niantic social app. Now, they

1291
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:29,760
didn't make me sign anything. So I tweeted about it. I was like,

1292
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,680
here's what it looks like. But and then they added a splash

1293
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:36,480
screen to the game that says reminder, this is confidential.

1294
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:40,000
And you're not just put anything out there on apps. And

1295
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,760
I'm like, Okay, look, if you want to know what the Niantic

1296
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:47,760
social is, download ingress because it is completely in the

1297
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:56,160
ingress game already, completely in the game already. So it's I

1298
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:59,080
don't know what they're keeping so secret about this app. I also

1299
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:02,120
don't know why they're building a separate app for it, and not

1300
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:06,760
just putting it into Pokemon go. But somebody I was talking to

1301
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:12,720
had a really good take on why is that maybe the Pokemon company

1302
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:15,760
won't allow it. That you know, there's only because you know,

1303
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,920
the Pokemon company kind of has to own a lot of the stuff that

1304
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,320
goes the Pokemon go. And maybe they're not allowing Niantic to

1305
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:23,640
put their social app in there. So they have to kind of do their

1306
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:26,360
own thing. I'm going to try to I'm trying to show you without

1307
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:29,760
like giving away where I live. Okay, I zoomed way in so you

1308
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,120
can't really let me turn the map a little bit. Okay, I zoomed

1309
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:35,880
way in here. So all you have to I'll show you the bottom half

1310
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:39,400
the screen, all you have to do if you hit the little button in

1311
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,160
ingress, and you go to the social, which is right in the

1312
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:46,600
middle. And keep in mind, I'm not breaking any rules. I'm not

1313
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:54,200
showing their app or anything I'm showing. There is oops, I

1314
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,760
got to make sure I'm not zoomed in too far on the dot. I don't

1315
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,320
care if it shows the neighborhood that I don't want

1316
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,640
it to show exact house. There's the Niantic social app. It's

1317
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,360
built in ingress. So if you want to know what's coming, just

1318
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:10,200
download ingress. It's right there in the game. So um, and

1319
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,560
why is Niantic doing that? Probably because they're seeing

1320
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,120
how much of their community is going to discord and slack and

1321
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:18,960
telegram and group me and all of those apps. And they're like,

1322
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:23,280
Hey, we want to have a little piece of that. So there it is.

1323
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,160
Mike Defton chat says this is actually really good for stuff

1324
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:32,600
like that. The group I was in for ingress used to use Google

1325
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,720
Hangouts back in the day. Yeah, back in the day until they

1326
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:37,680
retired that but yeah, oh yeah, I used to love Google Hangouts

1327
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:41,280
for that stuff. Mike Defton chat says the social app looks like a

1328
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,280
discord server and it looks so bad pretty much it looks like

1329
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:49,120
just a pretty cheap knockoff of discord. So I don't I don't know

1330
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:52,880
like what special thing is going to really draw people to the

1331
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:57,040
app, but we'll see. So anyway, Mike Defton says they use

1332
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:01,000
Facebook Messenger where they're at. Interesting. All right,

1333
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,600
anyway. That's what they're doing in Pokemon Go. Will they

1334
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:08,520
reverse the remote raid price change? Probably not if people

1335
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:12,960
don't stop buying them. So if you if you are pissed off about

1336
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,080
these changes, you have to stop buying remote raid passes.

1337
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:21,280
That's the only way this is going to change. Tapu Fini can

1338
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,040
even be shiny anyway. I don't know why people will people

1339
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:27,880
aren't rating him. I've gotten to raid him once with a remote

1340
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:31,600
raid pass. And this this is the part that pisses me off. Then he

1341
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,240
ran away. That's the part that I like I connected with every

1342
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:38,680
single ball and the fucker still ran away. That's what that's the

1343
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:42,520
enraging part. I don't you know if it's 100 coins to do it,

1344
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:47,440
whatever. But I literally got nothing for doing it. Except some

1345
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,560
stardust and thanks for playing. Silly

1346
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,960
and frustration. Don't forget that part.

1347
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,600
Yes, I got frustration. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome.

1348
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:58,560
Speaking of frustration, let's talk about some old school video

1349
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,880
games because I you know what a lot of those were really

1350
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:01,560
frustrating.

1351
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:16,400
Now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive

1352
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:19,840
into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1353
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:22,960
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1354
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:28,600
And this is a very unique kind of pick for tonight, isn't it?

1355
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:33,800
It is. So and I do hope that you skip around a little bit in the

1356
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,840
video. Sure. I meant to do an edited version. That's okay. I'll

1357
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:41,240
skip that a little bit. But I picked a Bobo's Big Adventure,

1358
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:47,440
which was a freeware parody flash game. It came out January

1359
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:52,120
11th, 2012 to play on any browser that would support

1360
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:57,480
flash. So the whole the basically the point is, is that

1361
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:06,160
you are a Bobo and you're trying to rescue your son. What was his

1362
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:10,960
name? Like a boy boy, I think was his name. That's cute. Yeah.

1363
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:16,080
But at any rate, you have to go through like different video

1364
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:20,440
games with like different characters mixed around. And so

1365
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:25,160
each of the sub games have different names. You have Double

1366
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:31,760
Drabobo, Super Mabobo, Urban Chabobo, Zelda Bobo, Balloona

1367
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:37,960
Bobo, Pro Rabobo, Mega Mabobo, and Contra Bobo and Puncha

1368
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:42,440
Bobo. So you have to use your directional keys to do your

1369
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:48,400
movement, you know, A and S are different actions. So like, like

1370
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:52,400
for example, the first one you're going through, and you

1371
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:55,560
know, beating people up, there's a Goomba that shows up, you know.

1372
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:03,000
All of the levels are a single level except for Contra Bobo. I

1373
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,800
mean, because Contra is like that. But yeah, you have to

1374
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:11,200
rescue a Bobo. That's his name, a Bobo, who gets, you know,

1375
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:16,080
beaten up in like the beginning of Double Dragon. And then you

1376
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:20,720
go through the different places until you end with Puncha Bobo

1377
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:26,640
where you run into Doc from Punch Out. And big spoiler,

1378
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:30,600
Little Mac is the bad guy. And then you have to decapitate him

1379
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:39,440
with a Power Glove. But it was all a dream. So it references so

1380
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:44,040
many different games in there. It's pretty funny. But the game

1381
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:49,240
actually started development in 2002 by the founder of iMakari,

1382
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:52,560
Roger Barr, who wanted to make it his first full length Flash

1383
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,360
game, and you know, show his favorite NES character a Bobo.

1384
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:00,320
He worked with a programmer named Bain and they did some

1385
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:04,600
early levels. It was delayed though for a while, especially

1386
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:07,720
when a game that was very similar called Domo-kun's Angry Smash

1387
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:16,520
Fest came out. But with the help of Nick Pasto of Pestoforce and

1388
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:24,680
Pox of the Pox Box, they started over in 2006 and just went going

1389
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:27,440
and tried to keep it along with, you know, standard NES

1390
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:32,600
programming styles. And so they they mixed up the characters and

1391
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:35,960
they did all kinds of different stuff. And then they had the

1392
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:40,000
Flash version working and they revealed the first three levels

1393
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,920
in 2009 at San Diego Comic Con with a NES controller, the way it

1394
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:51,440
was intended. They had a cabinet, everything there. And then in

1395
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:55,560
2010, they had a free to play cabinet with a sort with a NES

1396
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:01,920
homage joystick area with artwork done by Jeff Bandelin of

1397
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:07,960
Newgrounds. And then it got delayed again in 2011. And then

1398
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:14,120
finally, a bar took the game with him on a comedy tour that he

1399
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:18,440
was invited to go with. And then the trailer came out. And then

1400
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:21,920
after a bunch of and basically the trailer was a response to

1401
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:27,920
donations that they got. And then they started working on a

1402
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:31,640
smaller game called a Bobo Small Adventure for anyone who donated.

1403
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:37,800
And then on January 11, 2012, it was released on Newgrounds. And

1404
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,800
it had a tutorial how to play it with a with a NES controller.

1405
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:44,960
There's a downloadable version of the game. And they want to

1406
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,520
actually keep having the cabinet out there. The game was pretty

1407
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:52,200
well received. It went Newgrounds 2012 game of the year

1408
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:55,960
game spy gave them some kudos. They called it the mother of all

1409
01:44:55,960 --> 01:45:03,400
8-bitch 8-bitch 8-bit. I try to say homage. The mother of all

1410
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:10,160
8-bit homage flash video games. GameZone called it part parody

1411
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:15,160
and part tribute. They said that it's the story isn't cheesy, but

1412
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:20,440
is all kinds of badass. That is a quote. Wired said it was an 8-bit

1413
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:24,480
parody done right. So all along the board and the thing the

1414
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:29,480
biggest compliment is that Kishimoto Yoshihisa, who is the

1415
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:33,760
creator of Double Dragon, said in a Polygon interview that he

1416
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:38,480
was supportive and loved the game. You know, it's even been

1417
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:43,960
given some of its parody even was said to have blurred the

1418
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:47,840
line and go into the Dadaist expression. I thought that was

1419
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:52,600
pretty funny. It is it does have some surreal moments like like

1420
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:58,480
the whole part for me is the underwater level where a Bobo is

1421
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:02,960
having to, you know, swim through the Mario level and then

1422
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:06,280
there's like Bubble Man showing up and all kinds of interesting

1423
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:08,440
enemies. It's just really trippy and out there.

1424
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:13,320
I was reminded of Frog Fractions with how like not only

1425
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:17,200
referential this game is to, you know, other video games, but

1426
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:20,040
like how it's how it's really hodgepodge II, you know what I

1427
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:23,080
mean? Like we just that's the point of it. Yeah, we just saw

1428
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,080
that scene you were talking about here on the video. The

1429
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:29,280
whole like, underwater level from Mario meets a Mega Man boss

1430
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:32,280
meets the goonies meets like this is the balloon fight one.

1431
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,160
Yeah, it's just like everything going on at once. Let me see.

1432
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:37,120
I'm gonna fast forward to one more scene here. Oh, this looks

1433
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:40,040
like pro wrestling where he's actually killing the wrestlers.

1434
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:41,280
So that's that's something.

1435
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:45,000
Yeah. I also really like the Mega Man one because he just

1436
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,160
looks like his face has been photoshopped onto Mega Man's

1437
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:51,760
body, which is a bit further up. I think that's like the third to

1438
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:55,440
last one. And then there's the contra one and then punch the

1439
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:59,400
punch out when there's before punch out there's what is this

1440
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:05,960
is like Kirby. That's the contra one. But Oh, no, I can't show

1441
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:09,240
this act deaf. This is you trying to kill Kirby with a

1442
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:15,400
machine gun. That's bad. I'm pretty, pretty adorable. It is

1443
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,800
pretty adorable. Like if Kirby is going to be a villain, this is

1444
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:18,480
the way to do it.

1445
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:19,600
That's awesome.

1446
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:23,240
I agree with Bobby a drag race nest game called Super eight

1447
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:31,880
bitch. Why are you our only hope? All right. Is that it? I

1448
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:35,600
think that's it. There it is. Your class. It's Yeah, it's

1449
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:43,560
pretty funny. Apparently, it's still available at sites.google.com

1450
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:48,280
Um, and I wonder if this is Oh, yeah, I won't it won't play. You

1451
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:50,600
have to have like some browser let you do flash. But I think

1452
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:54,200
that someone out there if I remember right, I think someone

1453
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:58,840
out there did sort of messify it. But I'll see if I can find

1454
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:05,240
like the website. And yeah, I click on the website and it's

1455
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:10,400
just all Nope. So once on the internet being emulated by

1456
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:13,640
ruffle. So it has to load but you can still play it. I'll

1457
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:14,280
link it in the chat.

1458
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:19,800
All right. There it is your classic game of the week of

1459
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:27,800
Bobo's big adventure. A parody game of sorts. That, you know,

1460
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:29,880
this is kind of that's kind of fun to have, like, I guess,

1461
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:33,480
which would really be a homebrew game as the classic game of the

1462
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:37,960
week, but any game is eligible, right? So why not? And I and

1463
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:42,520
released games. Yeah. So I think I did space fantasy zone

1464
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:47,920
once you did you did the the one that was the polybius. That

1465
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:51,800
one. You did oblivious. Yeah, that one wants to so. Yeah, why

1466
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:55,480
not? So there it is classic game of the week. And that's actually

1467
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:59,200
the classic that never happened. That's one that I would love to

1468
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:01,880
go back and revisit because it is so funny. And it's like I

1469
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:04,720
knew I knew of it back in the day, but I never I didn't spend

1470
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:07,920
a lot of time with it. I didn't realize just how many layers of

1471
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:11,400
references deep it went. But that's pretty good. That really

1472
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:14,040
that does seem like a Loki game. Many people are in chatter

1473
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:16,880
saying don't ask why why are Loki's the NES developer

1474
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,080
remember? And I'm like, this is a Loki type of game. But I don't

1475
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,920
know if Loki wants to make you gonna make us a super eight

1476
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:23,440
bitch.

1477
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:25,440
Oh, no.

1478
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:30,400
He's got he's a Minecraft content maker.

1479
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:34,280
I'm starting to work on visual novels. But I'm actually using a

1480
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:39,400
visual novel tool to do my my DBD machinima.

1481
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:47,720
I'm here. All right, let's move on to rapid fire news. I have my

1482
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:50,480
hosting gigs on the side. That's my other thing. All right. Let's

1483
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:51,160
get a rapid fire.

1484
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:52,880
Nervous breakdown on the side. That's okay.

1485
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:58,040
Yeah, it's true. Is that too? Oh, am I my my weight loss? I'm a

1486
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:01,160
skinny. I have a side of skinny. All right, not really. But

1487
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:04,880
closer than it was. All right. Let's travel around and check

1488
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:08,720
out some other news going on in the industry. rapidly. That's

1489
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:11,240
why it's rapid fire news. I'm going to step away real quick

1490
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:13,480
because I need something to drink. So y'all keep rapid fire

1491
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:14,440
moving. I'll be back.

1492
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:19,480
So Epic Games is actually giving away Borderlands three for a

limited time. It's available now until 826.

1494
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,800

Yeah, 8am Pacific time. So uh, yeah, you can check it out. Um,

1496
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,920

01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:38,520
purchased it when it came out. So can't get it for free, but

1498
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:41,920
they're going to be doing some more giveaways here pretty soon

1499
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:46,200
outside of this. But yeah, it's it's pretty nice. And then of

1500
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,760
course, they're also having a sale going on right now as well.

1501
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:53,920
Along with that, there's news about the current generation

1502
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:57,480
version of the Witcher three, which is slated now to arrive at

1503
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:05,240
the end of 2022. And it's been delayed a bit. But you know, I

1504
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:08,640
know that they've been busy with fixing cyberpunk and stuff like

1505
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:14,000
that. But now they shared via Twitter that it is coming out

1506
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:21,880
q4 2022 on PlayStation five and Xbox series X and s. So we'll

1507
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:23,440
wait and see what that looks like.

1508
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:30,000
Well, then, um, have actually have you gotten anything though

1509
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,240
on the the sale that's going on?

1510
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:38,760
I have not because I haven't really been buying games because

1511
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:42,680
I will and that's not true. I have purchased games, but I

1512
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:46,280
don't play them. So no, I didn't pick up anything on the

1513
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:50,880
sale. Yeah, I haven't looked to see what they have because yeah,

1514
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:53,920
it's more stuff that just probably end up in my back log

1515
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,880
at some point. So at the finish for Lance three, I haven't even

1516
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,040
gone through all that. But

1517
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:07,400
for anyone on stadia right now, they're doing a sale on pac-man

1518
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:13,960
mega tunnel battle, and a few other goodies for it. And then

1519
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:17,440
they also have like a bunch of the Assassin's Creed games on

1520
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:20,720
sales, city legends hundred days, there's actually a few

1521
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:27,840
really good ones on there right now. And a bunch of stuff mark

1522
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:31,320
down like the city skylines, stadia edition, just quite a few

1523
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:34,360
things that's on sale right now, if you're another stadia player,

1524
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:38,560
I'm outriders outriders is one of them on pro right now, that

1525
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:41,320
not a lot of the games have a deep discount on epic games

1526
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:43,360
right now. The only thing that kind of jumps out at me right

1527
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,080
now that they have in their top sellers is probably Red Dead

1528
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:49,440
Redemption two, which is half off right now. Tiny T's

1529
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,680
wonderlands like 20% off but like, yeah,

1530
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:54,520
yeah, I want to check out tiny Tina's wonderlands. But I'm

1531
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,640
kind of with you, Loki. I don't want to add to my backlog right

1532
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:59,320
now. But you know, I grabbed Borderlands three. I didn't have

1533
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,960
that yet. So I was like, yoink.

1534
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:04,920
That's a great game. It's a little cringe as far as the

1535
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:08,640
story dialogue stuff goes, but the game itself is good. Yeah.

1536
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:11,640
Did you remember demos actually on stadia right now, including

1537
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,440
chorus?

1538
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:16,640
Did your MSN chat says ttw is so good. Yeah, I want to check it

1539
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:17,440
out for sure.

1540
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,960
Do well, I'm going into my news. I was trying to expand it to

1541
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:25,120
give you time to get some water.

1542
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,080
Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'm back.

1543
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:33,280
So for anyone who's playing Kirby 64, the crystal shards

1544
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:36,880
through Nintendo Switch Online, there is a game breaking bug.

1545
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:43,040
Um, when you are hit by a certain damage sources in the

1546
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:47,120
water, you become stunned indefinitely. And the only way

1547
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:51,120
to get out of it is to quit the level. And so you can't finish

1548
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:54,520
really any of the underwater levels because if you get hit,

1549
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:59,840
then you just stay that way. Um, no one remembers this glitch

1550
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,560
being on the original console. So there has to be some

1551
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:05,760
interaction with the original programming and the emulation, I

1552
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:09,520
think. So there you go.

1553
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:12,680
Boy, I want to apologize to Mike Deft. He's having a rough

1554
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:16,400
night. His fave is getting I mean, we just had him murdered

1555
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,440
during the classic of the week. And then now it's getting shit

1556
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:24,560
on. He's it's breaking. He's definitely this is this night

1557
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:25,800
for Kirby. I apologize.

1558
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:29,600
A giant Kirby though, just destroying everybody though is

1559
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:31,040
pretty funny. I'm just gonna say.

1560
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:37,920
All right, we will not apologize for the cute imagery of a evil

1561
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,880
Kirby taking over the world. I mean death by Kirby. What a what

1562
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:41,680
a way to go right?

1563
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:43,040
Precisely.

1564
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:47,720
All right. That's it for rapid fire news.

1565
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,560
Pie culture kaiju Kirby.

1566
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,680
Let's travel around the world and check out some release

1567
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:55,080
dates. Some things we'll be playing this week that don't

1568
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:57,280
have Kirby as a villain. Loki.

1569
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:02,640
I mean, anything's possible. I don't know. I don't. I don't

1570
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:05,040
keep up with a lot of these games that are coming up and

1571
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:09,960
maybe they do. So this week we've got hard space shipbreaker

1572
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:18,680
on PC. token Ranboo warriors on Nintendo Switch. Euro kill the

1573
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:23,080
culmination game on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and

1574
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:27,640
PlayStation five. sniper elite five on PC, PlayStation four,

1575
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:32,160
PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. And then we have

1576
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:39,640
the legend of Niota boundless trails on Nintendo Switch. And

1577
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:43,440
what else that cow the kangaroo on PC, Nintendo Switch,

1578
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:47,600
PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

1579
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:54,640
My little pony a maritime Bay adventure on PC, Nintendo

1580
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:59,000
Switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one. And to go along with

1581
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:04,080
Pacman's birthday Pacman museum plus on PC, Nintendo Switch,

1582
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,840
PlayStation four and Xbox one. That's it.

1583
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:11,160
Still a lot of releases. But then I just remembered this

1584
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:14,080
weekend is Memorial Day. And that's like the unofficial

1585
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:17,520
official kickoff of summer. So I guess this is always a big

1586
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,480
week for games. And the Yeah, when you kick off for summer,

1587
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:23,640
that means you stop releasing video games, because that's

1588
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:26,600
typically how that goes. Yeah. Well, you got to get the games

1589
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:29,320
out for the kids to pick up for summer break or whatever,

1590
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:32,240
although our is the school year getting expanded in a lot of

1591
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:34,560
places because of all the shutdowns? I don't know. I

1592
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:37,000
don't know. It depends like that. It's different for

1593
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,120
different districts. My son's off this week. So the other

1594
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:45,320
schools have taken upon themselves to add vacation

1595
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:48,160
weeks for every month. So some of those are going a little bit

1596
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:48,680
longer.

1597
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:52,920
All right, let's go to Japan and check out the releases there.

1598
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:56,960
It's actually pretty similar to what Loki already stated. So on

1599
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,640
the Nintendo Switch, we have radiant tale is out in Japan

1600
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:04,200
this week. That Yuru kill the culmination games is also out in

1601
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:08,120
Japan this week. The Legend of Niota boundless trails also out

1602
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:10,840
in Japan this week. I think I heard Loki mentioned all those

1603
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:14,920
games here. townsmen a kingdom rebuilt the complete addition.

1604
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:17,360
So I think that means DLC included with the base game.

1605
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:20,640
That is out from THQ Nordic in Japan this week on the switch

1606
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:24,920
and that Pac Man museum plus also gets a Japanese release

1607
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:29,080
this week on the PlayStation. Oops, I went to four and I meant

1608
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:33,000
to go to five. Sometimes five has some different stuff. PS

1609
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,880
foreign switch releases Japan are almost always identical with

1610
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:38,920
PlayStation five is sometimes has some different ones. That

1611
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:43,040
Yuru kill combination games is also on PlayStation five. They

1612
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:46,640
also have the persistence enhanced is out in Japan this

1613
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:49,920
week. And Oh, interesting. Japan gets their version of five

1614
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,000
nights at Freddy's security breach this week. It is noted

1615
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,120
this is an English version of the game. So it hasn't been

1616
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:57,960
completely localized, but it is getting officially released in

1617
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:02,360
Japan this week. So interesting. All right. And yeah, I agree

1618
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:05,160
with she Hulk and chat. Yes, please for Pac Man Museum. I'm

1619
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:08,520
looking forward to that as well. Dark Sakura. How about Europe?

1620
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:15,840
On the 24th we have eastward for switch. On the 26th we have

1621
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:21,040
for PlayStation and Xbox sniper elite five. And also how the

1622
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:25,040
house of the dead remake for switch. On the 27th we have cow

1623
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:29,600
the kangaroo on the big three, and My Little Pony maritime Bay

1624
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:33,440
adventure. And then also just on PlayStation we have mortal

1625
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,720
shell game of the year steelbook edition.

1626
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:38,600
Did you know the limited edition of that house of the

1627
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:43,800
dead rerelease is called the limit dead edition. And I find

1628
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:44,360
that so funny.

1629
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:45,160
I love it.

1630
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,760
Love to hear that worse the pun the better.

1631
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:55,160
We're getting to that age. All right. Let's move on. We have a

1632
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:58,640
few more stories for y'all. And then we'll take your calls and

1633
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:01,960
comments, emails, all that good stuff. And the listener

1634
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:04,360
roundtable. But first, we have a few more stories to get

1635
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:05,520
through. And we'll start with Loki.

1636
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:09,800
Like it's another week and we get to talk about Activision

1637
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:12,800
Blizzard and more trouble at their end. Of course, this time,

1638
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:18,200
it's not about you know, all the misogyny and stuff going on. No,

1639
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:26,040
we're going back, you know, has several months now back to the

1640
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:30,320
land of lawsuits because of gambling and minors. So we're

1641
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:34,880
gambling and minors in this course being with loot packs.

1642
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:40,160
So the target of this is of course Hearthstone, specifically

1643
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:45,120
saying that people pay real world currency to gamble on

1644
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:50,280
winning in game items. And they won't provide refunds even when

1645
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:55,040
the purchases are completed by a minor. And apparently they argue

1646
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:59,520
that children comprise a large segment of their audience. And

1647
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:01,920
saying that it's unlawful, deceptive and misleading

1648
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:05,600
tactics in Hearthstone. So I think the whole like, you know,

1649
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:09,520
enticing people to buy those packs or something like that,

1650
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:14,520
that, you know, it's, I don't know, a class action or

1651
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:20,200
something worthy. It's a stretch, I think, but like, I

1652
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:23,400
get it, you know, that they're saying it because it's targeted

1653
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:27,360
towards everybody, but I don't know. Like some other countries,

1654
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:30,320
they've been able to kind of get away with, you know, making

1655
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:34,440
that lawsuit type of thing happen. But I don't know if they

1656
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:38,040
necessarily like, I don't see odds posted on this stuff.

1657
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,840
No, I don't think they have them. And maybe this is going to

1658
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:45,200
pressure them into doing it. But, you know, your kids can't

1659
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:48,160
keep buying this stuff if you watch what your kids get.

1660
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:53,240
Especially like the screenshot that they show is like a pack

1661
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:59,600
that's $125. Like that's a lot of money, like your kids aren't

1662
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:04,640
going to necessarily be buying that. Now to bring it back to my

1663
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:09,200
kids, like they do get a lot of money and like Roblox sometimes,

1664
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:12,240
especially or Roblox or whatever. It's like 100, almost

1665
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:16,360
$100 during birthdays or stuff like that Christmas, and they'll

1666
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:19,520
blow it like instantly. So it's,

1667
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:23,760
yeah, if you see that if you give a child an unlimited

1668
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:27,320
balance, they will go through Yeah, yeah, I can see that. But

1669
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:30,640
like, you know, I don't know, like they're saying that there

1670
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:34,080
is one, one of the people that are part of the lawsuit said

1671
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:38,400
this child spent over $300 on the Hearthstone between 2019

1672
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:44,120
and 2021. Actually, not that much, honestly, like, like, oh,

1673
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:46,240
they were made without his permission using his credit card

1674
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:48,400
and debit cards. Yeah. But at the same time, though, that

1675
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,760
that's your fault for not securing your financial stuff

1676
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:54,520
to that. That's the same as like, you know, having kids or

1677
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:57,880
teenagers stealing cash out of your purse or something like

1678
02:01:57,880 --> 02:02:01,280
that. Like it's, if you don't secure your finance, financial

1679
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:05,680
stuff, like, yeah, that can happen. But that's not the

1680
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:09,840
game's fault. But at the same time, I'm not going to say that

1681
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:14,680
like, you know, they aren't trying to tap into that whole

1682
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:19,320
gambling FOMO type of mindset when it comes to selling these

1683
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:22,920
packs, because they want you to feel like you need to buy them.

1684
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:24,640
And so they're going to advertise them like that.

1685
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:31,840
All right. Well, there's I saw I even though I think there's

1686
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:34,440
kind of a part of me that's like, yeah, get Activision

1687
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:37,040
Blizzard, get them, get them, especially Bobby Kotick, get

1688
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:40,360
him, like, personally, he should be sued for this just because

1689
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:42,720
he's still the CEO of the company. But that's not the

1690
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:45,240
realist of the situation. I think in this particular

1691
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:47,920
situation, like you've just you've got to put some onus on

1692
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:51,000
the parents for how much their kids are spending. You know,

1693
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:57,600
when I ran up $100 prodigy bill from using chat rooms, I got I

1694
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:59,920
don't want to say beat up because it wasn't that I didn't

1695
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:03,640
have that but but but verbally, I got some verbal lashings over

1696
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:07,160
the whole thing and grounded fucking grounded like hell and

1697
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:11,640
not able to use any of prodigy anymore after that for a little

1698
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:13,720
while. So you know, you got it. You got to put some

1699
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:16,960
responsibility on, you know, laying down the law when your

1700
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:20,840
kids get out of control with that stuff. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah,

1701
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:23,760
I'm with Mike Deft. As much as we want to dunk on a BK right

1702
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:28,120
now. This ain't it. I and I agree. This ain't it. So. All

1703
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:33,160
right. Let's move on. I wonder if this will be it will sit dark

1704
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:33,720
Sakura.

1705
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:41,120
Well, I think it's, I don't know. So McDonald's is making a

1706
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:44,920
video game. I mean, we did have Burger King do it. But this one

1707
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:50,680
instead make kids is one more Burger King game so bad, like so

1708
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:51,200
bad.

1709
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:52,720
Let the story be read, Loki.

1710
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,360
Anyway, it's sort of an advertisement sort of game.

1711
02:03:57,360 --> 02:04:02,360
It's called McDonald's crush the rush. And you play as an

1712
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:07,400
employee working with drive thru orders. I mean, wasn't

1713
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:11,880
there like what an over like a waitress game? I think it sounds

1714
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:13,240
like root beer tapper.

1715
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:15,880
No, it's, it's

1716
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:19,480
a cafe, like Cafe Crush or something like that or like

1717
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:20,560
cafe, diner,

1718
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:26,120
dash, diner, dash, something ish. I mean, basically, what you

1719
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:29,540
have to do is you go to your different stations and you make

1720
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:31,840
the different things and you get what you need. It almost looks

1721
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:35,720
like a Sims view from up top. But basically, it's just

1722
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:39,440
clicking the order of items and get your team to work as

1723
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:41,640
efficiently as possible. And they want to make it look like

1724
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:46,400
food service is fun and entertaining. But it is

1725
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:50,720
repetitive gameplay. The whole thing is just to try to get

1726
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:53,500
people to work for McDonald's. And I don't know who would want

1727
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:54,000
to do that.

1728
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:59,720
I honestly like if I can't imagine somebody plays angles.

1729
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:04,940
Yeah, okay. I like that. Well, it seems like wasted. So I mean,

1730
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:08,380
I think of America's Army, you know, that was also a recruitment

1731
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:10,700
tool for a game and apparently they were actually fun. Yeah,

1732
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:11,500
apparently did pretty well.

1733
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:12,780
But they're solid games.

1734
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:16,340
Fanara wants to point out to Overcooked, which was also on

1735
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:18,260
the tip of my tongue. That was it. That's another one of those

1736
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:19,780
like team prep games. Yeah, yeah.

1737
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:24,740
That's that's a different type of game. Yeah. But yeah, I'm

1738
02:05:24,740 --> 02:05:31,140
with, we need the king as dead by daylight killer for sure.

1739
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:33,300
Well, definitely is scary enough.

1740
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:36,700
Oh my god. I mean, McDonald's has all of these great

1741
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:39,500
characters that they're not using for games like they, you

1742
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:42,720
know, I mean, forget the Burger King. How about the fucking

1743
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:46,740
grimace from McDonald's? That would be a scary I mean, that

1744
02:05:46,740 --> 02:05:50,060
practically is clown in that hippo outfit, but still like the

1745
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:54,260
grimace would be a scary fucking dead by daylight killer or the

1746
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:58,780
Hamburglar. Or what's what's the other one? Then there's the

1747
02:05:58,780 --> 02:06:02,660
the their their friend with the pigtails. Yeah, the birdie? I

1748
02:06:02,660 --> 02:06:05,140
think her name is literally birdie birdie the early bird.

1749
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:05,580
Yeah.

1750
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:11,500
And then we got it. Then we got to really go back and get the

1751
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:14,580
moon. Whatever that was big. Was it Mac?

1752
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:16,740
It was Mac. Mac tonight.

1753
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:20,900
No, what I want is the Hamburglar to be the killer.

1754
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:24,460
And then the fry guys to be like out in the map like with

1755
02:06:24,460 --> 02:06:28,620
Nemesis and the zombies. Which by the way, I have officially

1756
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:35,060
stolen a couple of zombie names from other streamers. So we name

1757
02:06:35,060 --> 02:06:35,740
our zombies.

1758
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:39,700
I would really go for like a dead by daylight game that's

1759
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:44,020
just with fast food mascots. Like let's let's do it.

1760
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:47,620
The five night Freddy's five nights at Freddy's rumor for DBD

1761
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:51,420
will never dies. Now it's been rumored for the last like seven

1762
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:55,140
DLC is and they still say oh, it's coming. It's coming. Five

1763
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:56,260
nights at Freddy's coming.

1764
02:06:56,900 --> 02:07:00,820
Keep in mind too is that and they even said so in a very

1765
02:07:00,820 --> 02:07:03,540
recent interview that when they're working on DLC, they're

1766
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:09,740
working on anywhere between like four to 10 extras a year to come

1767
02:07:09,740 --> 02:07:14,660
out and in in in following years. Like the apparently the

1768
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:18,140
Candyman one is still floating around and has a lot of credence

1769
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:18,540
with it.

1770
02:07:19,980 --> 02:07:24,140
Um, listen, boy chat room really loves this McDonald's cross step

1771
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:26,980
by daylight, I guess with Burger King thrown in there as well.

1772
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:30,740
You know, Chad is really eating this up. So there there's

1773
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:36,620
I guess I'll show 100 Matt's comment. The Burger King Kids

1774
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:38,620
Club grows up to be a cult like the purge.

1775
02:07:38,700 --> 02:07:41,740
Oh, now me just added Wendy's to the mix because why not?

1776
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:44,860
Oh, you know, Wendy would just dominate. She'd be like the

1777
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:49,540
nurse. Difficult to master but once you do, everyone's your

1778
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:50,020
bitch.

1779
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:54,300
There was a comment I was gonna read up here. Oh, yeah. Oh,

1780
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:57,580
teacher teacher on SS Do you get paid a living wage for playing

1781
02:07:57,580 --> 02:08:01,420
this game? Oh, that was a true that was the truth that was

1782
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:06,620
killed by truth. Um, for Nara said, Do they have DLC for this

1783
02:08:06,620 --> 02:08:10,460
McDonald's game for the McFood game that has the drunk or stone

1784
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:15,980
customers and Karen DLC to real to real.

1785
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:19,340
That's awesome. That's like her other comment. Wendy's social

1786
02:08:19,340 --> 02:08:20,620
media manager is a part.

1787
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:27,300
I was gonna say this the stone customers, they're at Jack in

1788
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:31,100
the Box because number one, everybody in America knows the

1789
02:08:31,100 --> 02:08:34,660
McFlurry machine. And that's what you want is always broken

1790
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:35,980
after a certain hour.

1791
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:39,740
But hex session one sauce.

1792
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:47,620
But Jack in the Box specifically caters to stoners like they

1793
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:51,580
advertised it as what do you think those late night munchy

1794
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:54,620
boxes are like legitimately they sell something at Jack in the

1795
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:57,420
Box. I know Jack in the Box isn't a nationwide chain. I

1796
02:08:57,420 --> 02:09:00,740
think they're they're good. I Jack in the Box would have an

1797
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:02,300
add on called three day old grease.

1798
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:06,860
But but Jack in the Box specifically has like a late

1799
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:11,300
night thing that's like a few jalapeno poppers, some popcorn

1800
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:15,220
chicken, an egg roll, some curly fries, like it's like a literally

1801
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:18,580
a little bit of everything. But it's only available after 11

1802
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:19,100
o'clock.

1803
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:24,820
And we know exactly why.

1804
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:28,900
Do you know you know how we have barbecue and chili? Hmm. Yeah, I

1805
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:33,380
think for Wendy's, it would be a chicken nuggets and Frosty's.

1806
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:37,380
Yeah, chicken nuggets and Frosty's. All right. Yeah. All

1807
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:41,500
right, we got to move on. Let's move on to another story. Loki, I

1808
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:42,260
think this is yours.

1809
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:48,660
Yeah, so Nintendo is ramping up their fight against cheaters

1810
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:53,020
because they have their new eSports game right around the

1811
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:58,860
corner with Splatoon three. So they are pants are patenting a

1812
02:09:58,860 --> 02:10:04,860
new anti cheat program. Okay, apparently they're saying they'd

1813
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:09,380
use something called code reuse techniques to auto generate

1814
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:12,660
attestation programs to detect whether a game has been

1815
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:17,100
modified. I don't know what that means. But they're going to do

1816
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:22,060
something to try to stop people from using hacked copies or

1817
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:26,060
running fake ones or something like that. And then

1818
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:30,980
it sounds like it's not just cheating in games, but trying to

1819
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:33,740
get people to stop like launching homebrew and down

1820
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:37,180
piracy. Really, it's a pirate, which I understand that, you

1821
02:10:37,180 --> 02:10:40,740
know, I don't I'm not a fan of pirating current games and so

1822
02:10:40,740 --> 02:10:45,700
forth. But yeah, and I think they should be getting

1823
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:48,980
especially with online games. I don't give a shit if you cheat

1824
02:10:48,980 --> 02:10:51,660
in a single player game. Like if you're cheating in Super Mario

1825
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:56,140
Sunshine, or boy, that's a dated reference. Super Mario Odyssey.

1826
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:58,260
Well, hell, you can cheat and sunshine too, because that was

1827
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:02,340
in the the recent Mario pack. Mario All Stars they did. But if

1828
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:04,500
you cheat in those games, I don't fucking care because it

1829
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:07,500
doesn't affect anything else. But if you cheat a Mario Kart

1830
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:11,100
online, then I'm mad. So Nintendo should be taking steps

1831
02:11:11,100 --> 02:11:12,180
to prevent that. Right?

1832
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:18,580
Exactly. They should be. But I don't know. I think they're the

1833
02:11:18,580 --> 02:11:22,140
downside, though, is I mean, the device is made, it's based off

1834
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:25,380
of an Android device, and it can run native Android. It's like,

1835
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:28,540
it's gonna be hard, or it's gonna be easy for people to

1836
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:31,020
circumvent all that stuff. That's how we have all this

1837
02:11:31,020 --> 02:11:35,060
crazy, you know, emulation stuff. I mean, I don't know,

1838
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:37,460
it's gonna be hard for them to do it. But I'm sure they'll

1839
02:11:37,460 --> 02:11:43,780
try. I don't know. Anything that reduces the number of hackers

1840
02:11:43,780 --> 02:11:46,340
that they have in like Splatoon stuff, I guess.

1841
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:49,500
And I can see why they want to get that going in advance of

1842
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:53,740
Splatoon three as well. Yeah, yeah, definitely. So that the

1843
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:57,020
chat is still talking about fast food. And now they're talking

1844
02:11:57,020 --> 02:12:01,340
about I see Taco Bell versus Del Taco. I'm gonna come at you

1845
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:04,620
with a real hot take. What is the big fucking deal about

1846
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:05,460
Mexican pizza?

1847
02:12:06,980 --> 02:12:10,300
What is it's fucking delicious. It's like one of the only things

1848
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:13,460
there that I like. I don't think it's then again, I mean,

1849
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:15,740
honestly, the last time I ate at Taco Bell, it was so disgusting.

1850
02:12:15,740 --> 02:12:18,020
It's like, just give me Del Taco all the time.

1851
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:21,300
They're soft. They're trying. Mexican pizza is a gigantic

1852
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:25,820
soggy nacho. That is what it is to me. I don't get it.

1853
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:30,100
Mike Defton chat says I asked the same thing and I don't get

1854
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:33,180
it. I'm gonna Mike Deft. You live in Mexico. Is that is that

1855
02:12:33,180 --> 02:12:36,860
a pizza? Is that a pizza? I don't think it is.

1856
02:12:37,700 --> 02:12:44,700
It's just it's just it's a giant stacked torta, I guess.

1857
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:47,380
Let's see other comments in chat. Sia Tabiri says Dolly

1858
02:12:47,380 --> 02:12:50,980
Parton would like a word with you, Rob. I know. I know. Dolly

1859
02:12:50,980 --> 02:12:56,060
Parton is my queen. But even even the people you hold in the

1860
02:12:56,060 --> 02:12:59,420
highest highest regard are not perfect people. And Dolly Parton

1861
02:12:59,420 --> 02:13:02,740
is allowed to make a mistake whenever she wants. But this is

1862
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:07,060
this is her mistake. Um, let's see. Kind Volibian chat says

1863
02:13:07,140 --> 02:13:10,780
Del Taco gets so much slander for no reason. It is amazing. I

1864
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:15,660
have to agree that Del Taco is so much better. It's like it's

1865
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:19,300
the only place you can get a taco and fries. It's great.

1866
02:13:20,260 --> 02:13:22,380
I don't like their fries. Their fries are super dry.

1867
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:26,540
I can't eat fries anymore anyway. So it doesn't really

1868
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:31,060
matter. But I like the tacos. All right. Mike Deft in chat

1869
02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:34,780
says an actual Mexican pizza. So for the record, for the record,

1870
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:39,260
an actual Mexican pizza from our listener who lives in Mexico is

1871
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:44,260
a pizza in all caps with traditional Mexican ingredients

1872
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:48,380
like chorizo or pepper. I could see that I could see that.

1873
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:51,700
That's actually that sounds good. It's like a chorizo as a

1874
02:13:51,740 --> 02:13:54,740
topping up. That sounds good. Actually, I would not be able to

1875
02:13:54,740 --> 02:13:57,780
eat it with all the peppers in it. I Yeah, I know. It's you

1876
02:13:57,780 --> 02:14:02,900
still to this day. My favorite pizza is California Pizza

1877
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:06,060
Kitchen's parent Gorgonzola pizza with plenty of roasted

1878
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:08,860
garlic on it. The end. That's the best pizza in the world and

1879
02:14:08,860 --> 02:14:10,140
no one can convince me otherwise.

1880
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:15,220
I never thought of chorizo on pizza. Now I'm like, that sounds

1881
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:18,580
fucking good. All right. I mean, the peppers that might be a bit

1882
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:21,260
much, but we'll see. We'll see. Maybe a little I can handle I

1883
02:14:21,260 --> 02:14:23,340
can handle a little bit of pepper. I just don't like a ton

1884
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:25,380
of it because it peppers one of those things that's just like it

1885
02:14:25,380 --> 02:14:29,100
dominates the taste. So let's Yeah, like I love

1886
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:32,940
I bet though if you deseeded the peppers and roasted them really

1887
02:14:32,940 --> 02:14:36,860
well, like almost blackened them. It would take some of the

1888
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:40,220
heat out of it. Yeah, I mean, I still wouldn't be able to have

1889
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:42,220
it because the enzymes will still be active even if they're

1890
02:14:42,220 --> 02:14:46,660
roasted. But this the heat is in the seeds for the most part. So

1891
02:14:46,660 --> 02:14:49,060
you deseed it and roast it really well. You get

1892
02:14:49,060 --> 02:14:52,380
caramelization on it. And the flavor profile would actually

1893
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:54,500
work well with the harder chorizo.

1894
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:57,500
We have a really good rex Kim restaurant not far from here.

1895
02:14:57,500 --> 02:15:00,820
And I don't know how authentic it is. Sorry, Mike deaf. But I

1896
02:15:00,820 --> 02:15:03,340
love to get they have a fajita salad as like my favorite thing

1897
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:06,220
on the menu for this current like diet I'm doing. And they

1898
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:08,580
put peppers in it. But it's like you said, they blackened them a

1899
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:11,460
little bit. So it doesn't like overpower everything else is I

1900
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:13,860
love the fajita salad there. It's so good. It's like the

1901
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:17,860
perfect lunch for me. Anyway, yeah. St 100 Matt says OLR foodie

1902
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:20,460
episode is happening now. Oops, oops. Yeah, well, we've put that

1903
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:23,980
off way too long. But that is 100% my fault. So we'll get that

1904
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:27,740
scheduled very soon. Mike deaf says if it's run by Mexicans,

1905
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:33,180
then I trust it. I believe so. I've never asked but I believe

1906
02:15:33,180 --> 02:15:39,340
so. So it we we don't usually have a problem finding decent

1907
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:43,460
Mexican food in California. Yeah, yeah, it's it's not hard

1908
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:46,340
to find but it ain't a Taco Bell. All right.

1909
02:15:46,940 --> 02:15:54,980
I mean, we we I have everything from super taco to taqueria

1910
02:15:54,980 --> 02:16:00,540
Vallarta to what's my other taco place? There's the truck that

1911
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:06,020
comes to work sometimes. And nothing is as as good as a good

1912
02:16:06,020 --> 02:16:08,420
taco truck. And then like one of my favorite burger places was

1913
02:16:08,420 --> 02:16:12,540
actually a chain started by a Mexican family called Tommy's.

1914
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:16,100
Oh, yeah. That's the place with the chili on the burgers. Yeah,

1915
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:19,220
you you made us detour to a Tommy's. It wasn't that far of a

1916
02:16:19,220 --> 02:16:21,460
detour. But you were like, we got to get Tommy's way home.

1917
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:26,820
Yeah. Yeah. All right. We have one more story for you before we

1918
02:16:26,820 --> 02:16:29,780
get to the listener roundtable. And that is to talk about what I

1919
02:16:29,780 --> 02:16:33,540
think is a very interesting turn of fate. And, you know, there's

1920
02:16:33,540 --> 02:16:38,220
been a lot of talk about Warner Brothers latest Smash esque sort

1921
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:41,700
of game called multi versus. In fact, I think people are

1922
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:45,380
streaming that on Twitch and stuff right now. I have a sneeze

1923
02:16:45,380 --> 02:16:49,180
coming on. Thank God I hit the mute button in time. Sorry,

1924
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:54,260
guys. Um, so multi versus is like a smash s kind of game

1925
02:16:54,260 --> 02:16:57,260
that's an alpha right now. Well, apparently the game is good

1926
02:16:57,260 --> 02:17:00,380
enough or the right agreements have been signed where multi

1927
02:17:00,380 --> 02:17:06,340
versus is going to be at Evo championship series for 2022. In

1928
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:11,420
fact, it's taking smashes spot. Now, you might remember Nintendo

1929
02:17:11,420 --> 02:17:15,780
pulled smash from Evo. So it's kind of their own fucking fault.

1930
02:17:15,980 --> 02:17:19,820
So it is very interesting that, okay, well, we're gonna replace

1931
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:24,580
smash with a smash esque or a smash inspired, we'll say, type

1932
02:17:24,580 --> 02:17:29,540
of game instead. So that's very interesting. So yeah, Nintendo

1933
02:17:29,540 --> 02:17:32,820
had pulled out of Evo. But we just we still don't know why

1934
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:35,380
Nintendo pulled out. But then we had the panda global

1935
02:17:35,380 --> 02:17:37,940
partnership. So maybe it was something like that. But now

1936
02:17:37,940 --> 02:17:42,860
Evo has multi versus so made this, you know, could Nintendo

1937
02:17:42,860 --> 02:17:47,540
have shot themselves in the foot by letting this get picked up

1938
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:51,140
by Evo. And now the fans are going to focus on it. People are

1939
02:17:51,140 --> 02:17:54,620
going to practice with this game. You know, I it's it's kind

1940
02:17:54,620 --> 02:17:57,820
of giving this game a leg up by its ability to be included in

1941
02:17:57,820 --> 02:18:01,260
Evo. So it'll be interesting to see. Quest Buster says an open

1942
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:05,300
beta is slated for multi versus in July. And I've seen a few

1943
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:07,420
streams that looks like the devs have a lot of fun with the

1944
02:18:07,420 --> 02:18:12,060
characters. So Mike Deaf says panda global is partnering with

1945
02:18:12,060 --> 02:18:16,660
Nintendo and Sony running Evo. So you know, so yeah, it's true

1946
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:23,940
Sony Sony bought Evo too. So anyway, let's go to the listener

1947
02:18:23,940 --> 02:18:27,780
roundtable. Every week we invite your feedback here on the show

1948

1950
02:18:35,740 --> 02:18:38,300
stepped away for a moment we'll, we'll ask her when she

1951
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:42,700

we'll always be happy to take a chat questions over in our chat

1958
02:19:05,100 --> 02:19:08,180
room over twitch.tv slash vog network where they're still

1959
02:19:08,180 --> 02:19:10,540
talking about multiverses, which is fine because we were just

1960
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:14,860
talking about that. While we wait to see if any questions

1961
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:18,060
well, let me get some comments here. Tiger class as I think

1962
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:21,700
it's good that multiverses will be at Evo. It gives the game of

1963
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:24,420
ton of exposure and might have more people wanting to play it.

1964
02:19:24,740 --> 02:19:27,500
And kind of Vullaby says I've already seen a number of pro

1965
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:31,220
smash players trying multiverses and it seems popular with them.

1966
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:34,100
I guess time will tell if it's just another fad or not though

1967
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:37,860
kind of like Nick all stars brawl. It's true. That one was

1968
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:40,980
supposed to be a big one and the shade is real came in when it

1969
02:19:40,980 --> 02:19:43,860
has all the voice actors in this one. So that's cool. Yeah, it's

1970
02:19:43,860 --> 02:19:46,980
true. It does. Dark soccer. Do we? I don't think we have

1971
02:19:46,980 --> 02:19:49,060
anything in the mailbag. But let me check just to be sure. Oh,

1972
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:52,040
no, we do not. Alright, so participate at orange

1973
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:56,540
launchradio.com. Oh, so I always say when when you don't email us

1974
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:59,020
and give us something to talk about, then it's an excuse for

1975
02:19:59,020 --> 02:20:02,100
dark soccer and I to talk about drag race. Now for the most part

1976
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:04,580
in the last year, I haven't bothered to watch drag race

1977
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:06,540
because there's just there's too many of them now there's there's

1978
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:10,700
the international one. There's the but they just give me a

1979
02:20:10,700 --> 02:20:14,380
couple of seasons. They just started the all winners one. So

1980
02:20:14,380 --> 02:20:18,100
all stars all winners started on Friday. And all I'm gonna say

1981
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:20,660
I'm not going to spoil because the Paramount thing is weird

1982
02:20:20,660 --> 02:20:22,940
because now that it's on streaming people watch at

1983
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:27,660
different times. All I'm gonna say is this is the shakeup the

1984
02:20:27,660 --> 02:20:32,900
format has needed for a long, long time. And I'll say I don't

1985
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:36,460
think it's a spoiler for me to say the show is now edited to be

1986
02:20:36,460 --> 02:20:41,580
99% positive. All the judges critiques positive, all of the

1987
02:20:41,580 --> 02:20:44,140
edits that the players got during snatch game and during

1988
02:20:44,140 --> 02:20:47,500
the first challenge, positive, everything was positive. And the

1989
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:50,660
show is not hurting because of it. Like it's actually probably

1990
02:20:50,660 --> 02:20:54,100
the strongest season they've had in a long time. So it was just

1991
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:56,820
it's amazing. And all I said that snatch game, you know,

1992
02:20:56,820 --> 02:20:58,900
again, I don't know if that's just because of editing where

1993
02:20:58,900 --> 02:21:01,420
they chose to show the positive but I really think like the

1994
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:06,660
talent that was in that snatch game like jinx monsoon. That's

1995
02:21:06,660 --> 02:21:09,500
the tweet. That's like there there there will never be

1996
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:11,860
another better there will never be a better game player than

1997
02:21:11,860 --> 02:21:12,260
jinx months.

1998
02:21:12,260 --> 02:21:17,420
I love I loved meeting her. She she's just so funny in person.

1999
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:23,820
You you have to see the snatch game she does. So can I can I

2000
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:25,260
can I tell you who she does?

2001
02:21:25,740 --> 02:21:26,380
Who does she do?

2002
02:21:26,460 --> 02:21:28,820
So the twist is that they have to do

2003
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:31,540
because before she did little Edie before right did she does

2004
02:21:31,540 --> 02:21:34,860
somebody different they have to do two characters this time. So

2005
02:21:34,860 --> 02:21:38,420
they actually do two different snatch games. The first game she

2006
02:21:38,420 --> 02:21:42,420
does Natasha Lyonne from my Russian doll the redhead right

2007
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:46,940
who isn't but I'm here. Oh my god she had the voice because

2008
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:49,780
you because you know Natasha Lyonne has a very distinctive

2009
02:21:49,780 --> 02:21:53,580
raspy voice probably from all the smoking. She had the voice

2010
02:21:53,740 --> 02:22:01,220
down. The second celebrity she does Judy Garland. It Jamie it

2011
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:06,740
was mind blowingly good. Like you laugh until you cry. It was

2012
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:10,380
so good. It was so good. You have to watch it like I'll loan

2013
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:14,260
you my because I mean, when when what's your name did a Liza

2014
02:22:14,260 --> 02:22:19,420
Minnelli. That was dead on and I can see jinx pulling off a

2015
02:22:19,420 --> 02:22:22,220
perfect Judy Garland. I would love to see the two of them

2016
02:22:22,220 --> 02:22:27,500
together. Yeah. So but but jinx has a really good talent for

2017
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:29,980
voices because her little Edie was pretty dead on to

2018
02:22:31,020 --> 02:22:35,020
Raja does a celebrity. I have to tell you who Raja does one of

2019
02:22:35,020 --> 02:22:37,180
them at least. Sorry. Sorry, Loki.

2020
02:22:37,220 --> 02:22:38,180
Just tell me both.

2021
02:22:39,460 --> 02:22:43,420
Diana Vreeland is one of the ones that she Raja does. And

2022
02:22:43,420 --> 02:22:45,620
that's that's like the the person that was over Vogue

2023
02:22:45,620 --> 02:22:48,300
magazine like in the 70s and 80s. So that was that was fine.

2024
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:53,660
That was funny. But she does Madam. The puppet from wailing

2025
02:22:53,660 --> 02:23:01,820
flowers and Madam. It is Jamie. It's, it's so good. It's so

2026
02:23:01,820 --> 02:23:02,340
good.

2027
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:06,260
The winners on the season or is it just a handful of all

2028
02:23:06,260 --> 02:23:06,900
winners?

2029
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:15,060
It's um, it's Raja, jinx, Shea couleé, Monet exchange, not

2030
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:22,540
Bianca, Trinity, the tuck, the Vivian from the UK. Did I say

2031
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:23,380
jinx already?

2032
02:23:23,860 --> 02:23:24,420
Yeah.

2033
02:23:25,980 --> 02:23:29,020
Oh, Jada, Essence Hall, and Evie Oddly.

2034
02:23:30,140 --> 02:23:31,020
I love Evie.

2035
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:35,540
So it's a really good cast. So even though Yeah,

2036
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:36,620
he's also a sweetheart.

2037
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:39,180
There's a lot of people that are like, Where's Bianca? Where's

2038
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:43,500
Trixie? Where's Alaska? I think these are a lot of girls that

2039
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:46,340
like are absolutely like not to say the others aren't worth

2040
02:23:46,340 --> 02:23:48,780
revisiting. But there are a lot of them are booked and blessed.

2041
02:23:48,780 --> 02:23:50,980
And I'm sure these winners could be booked and blessed too. But to

2042
02:23:50,980 --> 02:23:53,940
be on TV again and go through all this is really, really great

2043
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:56,260
for them. And it's just Yeah, and I'm sure they're saving some

2044
02:23:56,260 --> 02:23:58,900
for a potential second season down the line. So

2045
02:23:59,380 --> 02:24:04,860
I will. I will also tell you that I'm perfectly happy for

2046
02:24:04,860 --> 02:24:07,460
Tracy to not be on there if I can keep watching her use Easy

2047
02:24:07,460 --> 02:24:11,980
Bake Ovens. Anyway, I had Dan watching that he was laughing.

2048
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:16,060
Jamie, it was a it was a Waylon Flowers and Madam reference.

2049
02:24:16,060 --> 02:24:19,300
Like only like only people over 40 are gonna understand why

2050
02:24:19,300 --> 02:24:22,300
that's so fucking funny. But that was the stuff that was on

2051
02:24:22,300 --> 02:24:22,940
late at night.

2052
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:29,140
I will. I will have to go YouTube-ify it.

2053
02:24:29,540 --> 02:24:31,740
Or just ask me nicely for my Paramount Plus.

2054
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:34,380
We actually have Paramount Plus now so Dan can watch Star Trek.

2055
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:35,540
Well, then get on it.

2056
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:39,860
Eventually, eventually. All right. I got I got shit to do.

2057
02:24:39,860 --> 02:24:42,500
Like I still have to finish doing the cat video again. I

2058
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:43,900
need to send me more pictures of cheddar.

2059
02:24:44,740 --> 02:24:49,100
Oh, yeah, I need to send you cheddar cat pics for for a

2060
02:24:49,100 --> 02:24:51,900
redone intro video here for when we're live on Sunday nights.

2061
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:55,700
Absolutely. So I'd love to have a new one for our 20th. Because

2062
02:24:55,700 --> 02:24:57,420
I don't know what else we're gonna have for our 20th.

2063
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:01,180
Maybe that should be the foodie episode.

2064
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:04,540
Um, I think we should definitely get that done before the 20th.

2065
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:07,220
Yeah. So I'll have to check with everyone's availability, though,

2066
02:25:07,220 --> 02:25:08,820
because I know you're going on a big trip, Jamie, you're not

2067
02:25:08,820 --> 02:25:11,500
gonna be here next week. So I'm gonna be here next week. It's the

2068
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:17,700
week after. Um, I am flying to Illinois on June 2. And I'm

2069
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:22,740
returning on the fifth. I'm helping my friend move her cats.

2070
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:27,700
You are who has been who you have seen in in my streams, and

2071
02:25:27,700 --> 02:25:30,740
she's coming here as well. Amethyst Rose, which Oh, yeah, I

2072
02:25:30,740 --> 02:25:33,460
know the name. Yeah, yeah. My, my friend who also lives around

2073
02:25:33,460 --> 02:25:37,180
the corner for me. Um, basically, the cats can't go in

2074
02:25:37,180 --> 02:25:42,580
the car because of, you know, nervous reasons. So we in Delta,

2075
02:25:42,580 --> 02:25:45,820
which we're taking, we're doing first class, which I've never

2076
02:25:45,860 --> 02:25:51,580
done first class before. So come on celebrity. Well, I'm doing

2077
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:55,740
the the comfort economy on the way back, at least it's the, you

2078
02:25:55,740 --> 02:26:00,780
know, the comfort seats. But, but because, you know, we got

2079
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:03,260
to check the luggage because the cats are going to be a carry on

2080
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:07,980
each. And I'm going to be probably really drunk by the

2081
02:26:07,980 --> 02:26:08,620
time we land.

2082
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:14,020
Just saying, what part of Illinois, not Chicago, I guess,

2083
02:26:14,060 --> 02:26:18,620
just the rest of four hours from Chicago. Okay, without doxing a

2084
02:26:18,620 --> 02:26:22,420
fellow. Sure, sure. I understand. Yeah. So so but I'm, I

2085
02:26:22,420 --> 02:26:28,260
would like to go into Chicago, but we're flying into St. Louis.

2086
02:26:28,340 --> 02:26:31,740
And I said, Okay, you know, it's gonna happen. I double check to

2087
02:26:31,740 --> 02:26:34,420
make sure I could. We're going to the Waffle House.

2088
02:26:36,620 --> 02:26:41,020
I checked. I don't miss I did. I already checked. Okay, I was

2089
02:26:41,020 --> 02:26:44,060
gonna say Missy OLR St. Louis base. So I'd Yeah, cool.

2090
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:48,220
I said we are going to the damn Waffle House. You're gonna have

2091
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:51,820
the grits and you're gonna like it. No, I'm kidding. I don't if

2092
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:55,820
she doesn't like it. She doesn't like it. But um, I like I think

2093
02:26:55,820 --> 02:26:58,580
I have like three bags of grits that I promised one to my

2094
02:26:58,580 --> 02:27:02,300
co worker and I might just pick up some more on the way back.

2095
02:27:02,300 --> 02:27:05,420
Like if I get there early enough, I might stop into a

2096
02:27:05,420 --> 02:27:07,180
Waffle House. See if the managers there because you can

2097
02:27:07,180 --> 02:27:11,580
buy grits over the counter 99 cents a bag. Awesome. And at

2098
02:27:11,580 --> 02:27:14,900
last, I freaking love Waffle House grits now. Now some folks

2099
02:27:14,900 --> 02:27:17,740
in chat are like, Hey, Jamie's gonna be near me. I want to go

2100
02:27:17,740 --> 02:27:20,300
drive. Well, I'm gonna be near you briefly because we still

2101
02:27:20,300 --> 02:27:24,500
have to get those cats. Yeah. To my friend's place. Yeah. All

2102
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:26,660
right. Well, that'll be a fun trip. That's that'll be cool.

2103
02:27:26,700 --> 02:27:29,700
I it's a place I've never been before a couple places I've

2104
02:27:29,700 --> 02:27:32,700
never been before. I'd love to do a long drive across the

2105
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:38,700
country. At some point, but you know, time money. Her her

2106
02:27:38,700 --> 02:27:42,660
husband, I think is doing the the drive with all the the

2107
02:27:42,660 --> 02:27:46,820
moving stuff. And we're doing even know either that or they're

2108
02:27:46,820 --> 02:27:49,620
having movers do it and he's flying on his own to get start

2109
02:27:49,620 --> 02:27:52,140
getting stuff set up and then we're flying together on it.

2110
02:27:53,220 --> 02:27:56,460
Yeah. All right. Let me go to Loki and see if there's any

2111
02:27:56,460 --> 02:27:59,660
last minute stories for tonight to get into because mostly I

2112
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:02,180
don't see I didn't see any questions from chat. If I missed

2113
02:28:02,180 --> 02:28:05,020
it, please ask it again. But most most of chat is just

2114
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:08,220
adding to what dark soccer is talking about with her story

2115
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:08,500
there.

2116
02:28:09,580 --> 02:28:13,700
Sadly, there's not really anything last minute. Fair

2117
02:28:13,700 --> 02:28:17,260
enough. I imagine next week's gonna be a bit of a slow week

2118
02:28:17,260 --> 02:28:19,740
with it being Memorial Day weekends, a little bit of a long

2119
02:28:19,740 --> 02:28:22,180
weekend, or maybe that affects the week after I don't know.

2120
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:27,380
Oh, all right. Well, then I guess that is going to do it for

2121
02:28:27,380 --> 02:28:30,060
another episode of orange launch radio. Hey, thank you as always

02:28:58,940 --> 02:29:03,420
of that. So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or

2133
02:29:03,460 --> 02:29:07,300
wherever it is you found this Spotify. What else is out there?

2134
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:09,600
I don't even know anywhere wherever whatever you used to

2135
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:13,020
find this a going off a long way. So yeah, Mike Deaf says

2136
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:15,820
Summer Games Fest is close. So it's the calm before the storm,

2137
02:29:15,820 --> 02:29:20,620
I guess. Yep. And since there's no E3 this year, those type of

2138
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:22,780
summer announcements are just going to be sprinkled throughout

2139
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:24,860
the next three months because you'll notice Sony has not

2140
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:28,300
staked a claim. And I think they're waiting. I don't think

2141
02:29:28,300 --> 02:29:30,300
we're going to see Sony in June. I think we're going to see them

2142
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:33,460
closer to end of July, August, because they don't have nothing

2143
02:29:33,460 --> 02:29:35,700
else is forcing them to go earlier. So they're on their own

2144
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:40,420
timetable. So be very interesting. So all right. Um,

2145
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:44,580
and dark to see you. Yes, I did see what you were working on. But

2146
02:29:44,580 --> 02:29:49,620
I'll wait and talk about that during the 20th. So let's see.

2147
02:29:50,260 --> 02:29:53,420
That's it that I can think of. So this is the part where we go

2148
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:56,100
around and get everybody's final thoughts. I will start with dark

2149
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:59,300
Sakura because I know she's going to do a post stream for

2150
02:29:59,300 --> 02:30:01,300
y'all. Dark Sakura, your final thought.

2151
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:04,940
Um, I need blood points. I gotta feed a legion.

2152
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:11,080
All right, good luck with the some growing a teenagers quote

2153
02:30:11,080 --> 02:30:14,520
finger. Good luck teenagers. Sorry, stabbing and killing in

2154
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:18,420
dead by daylight. All right. Exactly. Later taters. Have a

2155
02:30:18,420 --> 02:30:21,860
good one. Loki will go to you in your final thought for

2156
02:30:21,860 --> 02:30:22,300
tonight.

2157
02:30:23,140 --> 02:30:26,260
I just saw that power wash simulator added more levels. So

2158
02:30:26,340 --> 02:30:27,940
I need to check that out again.

2159
02:30:29,820 --> 02:30:32,120
My final thought is I was just saying to a friend the other

2160
02:30:32,120 --> 02:30:35,220
day, I want to play a game like Diablo again, but I don't really

2161
02:30:35,220 --> 02:30:37,780
want to play Diablo. My friend was like, Oh, Diablo immortals

2162
02:30:37,780 --> 02:30:38,900
coming out. And I was like,

2163
02:30:40,020 --> 02:30:40,940
is there anything else?

2164
02:30:42,260 --> 02:30:46,140
Anything else? I mean, I haven't found engines. Oh, yeah, now

2165
02:30:46,140 --> 02:30:48,300
they're now you're talking maybe I'll pick up Minecraft

2166
02:30:48,300 --> 02:30:50,660
Dungeons again. That was kind of fun when I played it. So that'll

2167
02:30:50,660 --> 02:30:55,660
be fun. So. All right. Wow, as Joe and Matt says, I'm sadly

2168
02:30:55,660 --> 02:30:58,160
gonna miss the 20th anniversary episode going to a friend's

2169
02:30:58,160 --> 02:31:00,580
wedding that night a damn Sunday wedding. Well, I mean, it's a

2170
02:31:00,580 --> 02:31:02,940
good excuse. But you know, it's really funny. Bobby Blackwell is

2171
02:31:02,940 --> 02:31:06,380
missing our 20th anniversary as well. So you know, I guess if you

2172
02:31:06,380 --> 02:31:10,220
can be here, it's gonna be a small party. It'll be it'll be a

2173
02:31:10,260 --> 02:31:14,100
pandemic party. Right? In all seriousness, thank you any week

2174
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:16,520
that you're here. We appreciate you. Have a wonderful week,

2175
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:18,580
everybody. We'll see you in seven days to do it again. Have

2176
02:31:18,580 --> 02:31:19,660
a good night. Bye.
