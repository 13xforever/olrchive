Microsoft applied for a patent for allowing a secondary device to validate a disk enabling a primary device without an optical disk drive to license and run that media.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
One possible translation? Microsoft applied for a patent for allowing a PC to validate a game disk enabling a diskless Xbox Series console to license and run that game.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
A patent is not a guarantee that it'll happen, but it is a neat consideration.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to discuss this story and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 01:01.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode number 915 of our show for tonight, May the 22nd of 2022.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined by my co hosts. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Hello.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Hi, how are you doing?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm doing good.

01:11.000 --> 01:20.000
Good. Also joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie. Oh, she just sat down. I was gonna say she stepped away, but then she stepped back. Hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Hi.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Hi, you have impeccable timing. How are you?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, I'm okay.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
All right. Did you go shopping this weekend? Because I see a bag with kitties on it behind you. At least that's what it looks like from a distance. Okay, I was

01:33.000 --> 01:53.000
I went earlier. And what I do is that when I go to different places, I sort them by the kind of material they are in the back of my car. Oh, so what the reason why I do that is so that I can like take a bag to my office. It's got art supplies, I can take a bag to the kitchen for food, I can take one to the bathroom for toiletries.

01:54.000 --> 02:17.000
But in this case, the stuff that goes in here usually art supplies. And I've been scouring all the Rosses I can find near me. Because I lucked into acrylic paper, which is typically something like 20 to 30 bucks for 10 sheets of paper, which and I don't know I found them for two bucks a pop.

02:17.000 --> 02:25.000
I don't know if it's a national chain, but Ross dress for less or some of my friends all over the place. Some of my friends affectionately call it cross dress for less.

02:25.000 --> 02:36.000
Well, it it just happened to have sometimes and I bought Copics they had a pack of Copic chows that had colors I didn't have so I picked them up.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
You can get good deals those places I get coffee finding a Copic a set of Copics is like finding a unicorn though.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
I get coffee supplies to those places for cheap not just the cups for like sugar free sweeteners and all that type of stuff you get cheap. That stuff's more common. Yeah.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
The pack of Copic markers that I paid 20 bucks for are about 35 retail.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
And on top of that it's a high end art supplies so we love a sale with.

03:03.000 --> 03:12.000
That's true. I was I was like, I found the pack and that now mostly I work with Copic sketch markers which are about $8 per marker.

03:12.000 --> 03:21.000
But I'm not going to say no to a pack of Copic chow like it's the same ink same quality same nibs. I was like, heck yeah, and it had a blue multi liner in it which I was looking for.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
So, that's cool. And I can buy canvas is really cheap there too.

03:25.000 --> 03:35.000
That's good because there's no, no longer there used to be an art supply store that was everywhere called Aaron brothers my mom that was my mom's favorite store because they're Aaron brothers is hardly an art supply store, well but they're they're

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
they did framing and they're no longer anyway they went out, they all went under. So, yeah, I just remember there's still loved going there.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
I think university artists still around so is a blix art supply which is a bigger chain and they are dedicated art.

03:50.000 --> 04:02.000
There's, I actually I buy Copics at Michael's of all places because the Joanne's here doesn't have a very good selection. And the Michaels actually does, and they'll sometimes do like a buy one get one half price.

04:02.000 --> 04:11.000
And for Copics that's unbelievable. Well believe it or not it's a video game podcast but you know what we know that you want sales on all the merchandise to make your fan art.

04:11.000 --> 04:24.000
So when you all out there are celebrating the dead by daylight dating sim that's coming out we'll talk about later in the show or is literally doing dead by daylight fan art is dark soccer showing off on stream, because we do take live every Sunday night

04:24.000 --> 04:35.000
at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific, and they can catch the VOD if they want to see it twitch.tv slash vog network that's VOG network, and we'll talk about deals for all sorts of things.

04:35.000 --> 04:49.000
We also sometimes talk about other types of media, not just video games, but Loki I can't help but notice you've got a classic eight bit Disney game playing behind you because there were, there were some really good like Capcom had the Disney license for games in the

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
job with they made some great Mickey Mouse could pay DuckTales of course all 10 classics but you plan tonight, rescue.

04:57.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah, I have a feeling this has to do with that movie that just came out a few days ago. Because it's up. Go ahead. Absolutely fantastic. Yes, I'm seeing it all over the game blogs because I guess they brought back the Sonic the hedgehog that everybody hated from the original trailer and they call them ugly.

05:17.000 --> 05:34.000
Yes, but I was laughing because ugly Sonic apparently does appearances at fan conventions now and I was just laughing because that's just like that's such a like I haven't even seen the movie, but that's just like such a thing for ugly Sonic to do to capitalize on that one appearance

05:34.000 --> 05:55.000
that they made and believe me, you all know I do multiple things I don't just host to LR I've met a lot of people in my other gig that try to make that one appearance that they did last for a long time. What I will, I will, I will just say two words that will illustrate this point very well. Miss Vangie.

05:55.000 --> 06:18.000
Well, that's that's that's an entire empire based off of a infamous exit. But okay, so but it's not even though all the gaming blogs are talking about ugly Sonic. My understanding is the movie just consistently throws like, like that's every Gen X millennial like Zillennial or the trail generation like that, like the our age basically references everywhere.

06:26.000 --> 06:50.000
They integrate the pop culture like cartoon and live action stuff, and like even like CG puppets, like all sorts of things together in like one cohesive world. It's not like Space Jam where it's like, hey, you remember that? Hey, you remember that? Like it actually makes sense like in the world and, and they make fun of things that it's, it's hilarious. The premise is hilarious.

06:51.000 --> 07:07.000
Just like the jokes are ridiculous in a lot of the things. I don't know. It's like, I know when I saw like the trailer for the movie, I was like, you know, I like Andy Samberg. I like Oh, gosh, I can't remember the other guy's name.

07:07.000 --> 07:36.000
Um, we don't like that much. No, I can John Mulaney. So I, so I like their work a lot. Like they're great writers on SNL. They have a lot of really funny stuff that they do in that. And like, there is just like, it just comes like all of their like personality comes out and all these characters and stuff and they just it's it's hilarious, like the different like characters that they bring back and like just the whole bunch of stuff.

07:37.000 --> 07:53.000
The whole plot line. Everything is ridiculous. And some of the gags that they do even like with the ugly Sonic stuff. It's just, it's hilarious. It's all hilarious. It's so good. Like, I don't know. Like I was watching as like, this is why is it this good? Like this is ridiculous. It shouldn't even be this good.

07:54.000 --> 08:20.000
Um, DJ rama. I'm sorry. Let me get some several comments in our chat room. sj 100. Matt says is the movie good. It looked totally trashy in the sense that it knows it's trashy and it's just joking on itself. DJ rama says there's some cringe but overall it was really good. The remake of the rescue Rangers theme is trash though. Mike Deaf says it was okay for me not that great but funny and entertaining way better than Space Jam two. So there is that

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
that is a low bar to hit but yes.

08:24.000 --> 08:48.000
All right, well, I'll check it out ways but I'm a sucker for good reference. Somebody sent me there's like a billboard in the background that shows Doug from Nickelodeon's Doug is now a lawyer and like the gag was really funny. It said something like there's nothing funny about injury because his name was Doug funny. And it's Yes. And that was that was funny. So there's a lot of that stuff. There's absolutely a ton of that stuff.

08:49.000 --> 09:14.000
There's a joke that's about like, it's, you know, like the Batman Superman stuff. Well, this one's like Batman versus et. And then they they they see see that on a billboard and then they come back like immediately right after that and actually show a clip of the movie. And it's so stupid. I'm a sucker. It's great. I'm a sucker for a quick hit pun. Like I'm for a quick hit. There's so many why I loved Mitch Hedberg.

09:15.000 --> 09:39.000
Like that was the entire routine. It feels a little bit like like, I don't want to not really necessarily compare it to the Zucker Brothers stuff. But it's kind of like that where there's a lot of just like gags in the background and some of this stuff. Like if you don't like notice it, you might like miss a joke. Like I was laughing throughout the movie like a bunch of things that my kids like they don't get the reference because of like half the stuff in there.

09:40.000 --> 09:54.000
I was gonna say some of the soccer movie stuff is kind of lame. Some of it is classic, obviously, like some of the old school stuff is classic. Like but then I thought like, Oh, but they did the later scary movies, movies after the Wayans brothers, right? Because like the way I don't want to, but the later I don't want to

09:55.000 --> 10:17.000
spoil too much, but like, so like zipper and gadget end up like becoming a couple. And so they have a family. So you have to imagine, well, how's that work? A fly and a mouse? Well, they elaborate on that. And it's hilarious. All right. All right.

10:17.000 --> 10:38.000
I have to check it out some way. Sounds funny. Yeah. All right. Let's get into video games. I know. I know. But we got it. We got to talk about video games, or we're not allowed to call ourselves a video game podcast. But you know what, there's there's lots of platforms out there with media that are dipping their toe into gaming. And I think that's gonna do our kickoff topic for tonight. Loki, what do we got?

10:38.000 --> 11:07.880
Yeah, so tick tock has already, they're adding games to their platform, because, you know, they want to get people on that platform, and they want to stay there. So they've added a few small games, and they're planning to roll out more games as part of I guess, Southeast Asia later this year. Right now, they are. I don't really have that many games added in there. They have, I guess,

11:08.640 --> 11:37.920
was a disco loco 3d. It's a game from Zynga. And then they also have like some other like free to play stuff. It's a lot of mobile games like Marvel snap. So yeah, they're going to be incorporating more games into the platform. I don't know how that necessarily like, is it just that you can go play games there? Or is it like, does that integrate with the platform somehow? Like, I'd be curious to see what that means. Like, are you sharing clips of the

11:37.920 --> 11:39.440
games? I mean, like, what is it?

11:39.480 --> 12:07.760
I imagine it integrates with the platform a little bit. It's kind of it kind of reminds me of when Facebook was kind of doing this through messenger. And I think to some extent, they still have it. But I know they were pushing it pretty hard for a little bit is that in messenger, you could just like jump right into a game of Pac Man or something like that, where you actually but it was like a Pac Man competing against the other person type of thing. By the way, happy birthday, Pac Man. Maybe that's why it's on my my brain tonight. But I think this is something like that is that it probably is

12:07.920 --> 12:37.640
still launched within the tick tock app. But it is more of a gaming experience. I mean, if it was smart, they would allow you to share clips and things like that. But I don't know, I would think a lot of the success of this depends on the quality of the game. There's a lot of mobile games that have a reputation for being crappy mobile games. That's why I think when Facebook had Pac Man, it was interesting, because Pac Man has a reputation behind it. Everybody knows what Pac Man is, you know, if tick tock got Mario Kart, people would pay attention.

12:38.220 --> 12:49.480
Yeah, even Mario Kart mobile wasn't as good as the mainline games, but I digress. You know, I don't know if tick tocks going to really break through if the games don't get people to notice. You know what I mean?

12:50.300 --> 13:02.080
No, I get what you're saying. And yeah, I don't know if they're going to be I mean, they mentioned a game. So it's like, I don't know, maybe like,

13:02.520 --> 13:14.760
I mean, they might they might do that. Okay, so I think about like, it take talk as a platform really makes its living. I don't know what else to call it off of people endlessly watching. That's it's

13:15.520 --> 13:26.240
they make they make their money off of people's off of content creators stealing stuff from people of color, and then calling it their own and then making it popular. So take talk gets more revenue.

13:26.280 --> 13:30.840
Oh, that's that's any platform. That's Instagram as well. That's that's any any that's Twitter. It's all

13:30.840 --> 13:33.120
Don't be dismissive about it, though. It's a very big thing.

13:33.120 --> 13:39.160
I'm not being dismissive about it. Excuse me. I'm pointing out that this is a problem on every social media platform. It's not something that's unique to

13:39.200 --> 13:48.200
My point was that tik tok has been very recently called out on it. And it's been big news specifically on them very recently.

13:48.960 --> 13:49.520
Um,

13:50.760 --> 14:09.240
now I lost my train of thought, but people tend to just kind of endlessly watch tik toks, you know, one after the other. And I think Instagram is a very similar sort of thing like Instagram stories or whatever it is. And on Instagram, I know that you will see ads because I do

14:09.240 --> 14:39.120
chuckle. I will often see these ridiculous looking game ads where I know I know the game is nothing like the ad, because there's a lot of those ad will show like, I don't know the the mafia guy stealing someone's stealing someone's girlfriend or something. And then they drive off together and they're being chased by zombies and all these ludicrous things. You know, the game looks nothing like it. But the stories. Oh, God, what was the other one? There was one where like Kathy Bates was in the ad, and it made all this news. I think we even talked about it on

14:39.120 --> 15:08.560
the show. And like, it's a fucking match three puzzle game. But the ad was so over that was like grandma's mystery mansion or something. I don't want to give the game free advertisement anyway. But like it's like these ads are so ludicrous. And they're telling you to tap to download the game, which I bet a lot of people don't do. Maybe some because the ads are so silly. But in tik tok, and this whole integration thing, I would imagine as you're endlessly scrolling tik tok content, you're going to come

15:08.560 --> 15:38.200
across, you know, an ad or something, and it's just click here to play now. And I think that will probably be something that is what they're going to do is have it so you just click and play the game right now. But again, I think if the games aren't interesting, nobody's going to really care. I also, you know, one thing I see on again, it doesn't matter what the platform is, it's something that you know,

15:38.200 --> 16:07.760
it hits in one place, and it spreads everywhere is these filters, right? See it on Instagram, Snapchat, tik tok, they all have some version of it, where, you know, you see the filter. And it's like, I don't know what what Pokemon or what what Pokemon is my team. And it shows like six random Pokemon that go over your head, and you sit there and react to your team. And people watch that. It's like, oh, yay, I got a team I like or Oh, I got all pidgeys and rotatas. That's garbage.

16:07.920 --> 16:37.440
You know, people will watch that stuff for whatever reason. Because we're bored. But what if there's a game somehow out of those filters? That's where I thought maybe it would go is that you you play the game and watch people react live to it. Kind of like twitches mo or YouTube's I guess a certain component of that. But I would I would think maybe there's something there. I'm surprised when I heard tik tok is getting into gaming. It wasn't just, oh, they're trying to throw games at it like

16:37.440 --> 16:56.360
Facebook did like Netflix is doing all this stuff. I'm surprised it wasn't like they're trying to do something different with it. They're trying to gamify something they're already doing. But as pointed out earlier, all of these platforms all steal from each other. Anyway, so there's that. Let's see.

16:56.360 --> 17:26.240
DJ Rama S and chat says, I like tik tok better when it was called vine. Honestly, yes. RIP vine ahead of its time. And I don't know how Twitter ran that out of business. But they sure did. Because right. Twitter bought vine, didn't they? Or my parents go though. There was that to Twitter ran that out of business, too. So I don't, I don't know what happened there. But no vine was great. But this it was okay. So I just said earlier, I love a quick hit joke. And that's

17:26.240 --> 17:34.400
all vine was. You didn't have a lot of time on vine to set something else up. tik toks let you go longer. Instagram, Snapchat, they'll let you go longer.

17:34.400 --> 18:04.320
They just poked me for 10 minute videos. On on tik tok, you can do 10 minute videos on tik tok. No, they said they're they're rolling out 10 minute videos. Like I was in the five minute crowd. And I mean, really, all I put on there is just like, stuff I did in dead by daylight to advertise my channel. And then, like pinball stuff when I went to Golden State pinball Expo. But there's people who go on there to I don't even know.

18:04.400 --> 18:11.760
It's, I don't think these people are very interesting. Like people show stuff. And I'm like, it's not very funny. But then again, I don't think a lot of people are funny.

18:11.760 --> 18:41.760
Um, yeah, tick, tick tock's hard for me to get into, like, and I just wonder, like, is this an age thing? I don't know. Tick tock doesn't, I don't see a lot of content from people I know on it. Like, at least if I'm doing Instagram, or Snapchat, although a lot of my friends don't really use Snapchat. But like, I see people I know, and their content, tick tock, I I'll see, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival. But it's like, I'll see that something Paula Abdul posted, she's great. One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival. But it's like, I'll see that something Paula Abdul posted, she's great. One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival

18:41.760 --> 19:11.760
One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival One other person that I know, like, I know you're on it, because I saw the stuff you were posting at the pinball festival

22:41.760 --> 22:46.000
When you see her Horse and stuff, it's like, it's all thirst-trapped stuff

22:46.000 --> 22:56.120
When you see her Horse and stuff, it's like, it's all thirst-trapped stuff Um, then, like her YouTube and Instagram is all pimple popping things Yeah, but it starts to learn what you like

22:56.120 --> 22:59.760
Yeah, but it starts to learn what you like Don't knock it. I watch those too

22:59.760 --> 23:06.600
those platforms start to learn what you're engaging with and then it keeps showing you more of that, for better or for worse

23:06.600 --> 23:09.540
You know, that's what a lot of social media platforms do

23:09.540 --> 23:15.220
do. So, um, bonds, double six says have never viewed seen

23:15.220 --> 23:19.020
anything connected to tick tock. It's getting hard to escape. I

23:19.020 --> 23:21.540
have a hard time figuring out the secret sauce with tick tock.

23:21.540 --> 23:25.940
I have an account. I made one video because a local artist

23:25.940 --> 23:28.500
friend was like, you should get on it and make a video. And so

23:28.500 --> 23:31.740
we made a video together backstage to show. And I thought

23:31.740 --> 23:35.700
it was I thought it was stupid. Like I like not it was not this

23:35.700 --> 23:37.940
other artists. I made the joke or whatever. And I thought it

23:38.140 --> 23:41.780
was stupid. It did get a lot of views for being a throwaway

23:41.780 --> 23:44.420
video. And I was like, what the hell? You know, I don't

23:44.420 --> 23:46.620
understand this thing. But I don't I don't know what content

23:46.620 --> 23:49.860
to make for it. I really don't. So I don't know. Maybe I'll

23:49.860 --> 23:50.820
figure that out someday.

23:51.300 --> 23:53.300
I just some of these names people have

23:54.260 --> 23:55.380
the names on tik tok.

23:56.220 --> 23:59.660
Yeah, like Lord Panda waffles. I just saw that name just now. And

23:59.660 --> 24:00.580
I think it's a great name.

24:00.620 --> 24:04.180
That's Yeah, I mean, it is a great name. A lot of MMO is in

24:04.180 --> 24:06.780
video games. You see silly gamer tags and stuff too.

24:06.860 --> 24:12.940
I saw I saw a sassy pants. Give it a on in another game.

24:13.220 --> 24:17.980
Well, they're a fake fake bitch. sassy pants, by the way, was the

24:17.980 --> 24:19.860
name of my old Warcraft character for those who don't

24:19.860 --> 24:24.060
know. Let's see Zen monkey 11 says the secret sauce is it

24:24.060 --> 24:27.820
short and to the point. You don't have to be that short

24:27.820 --> 24:30.180
though. Because I've, you know, again, you just talked about the

24:30.180 --> 24:32.820
10 minute videos, the five minute videos. So yeah, be that

24:32.820 --> 24:37.780
short. Like vine was short and to the point. I would say I've

24:37.940 --> 24:41.180
definitely skipped past my fair share of tik tok videos because

24:41.620 --> 24:45.940
too too long to build up. It's just like the same problem with

24:45.940 --> 24:49.460
a lot of youtubes too because the first minute will be Hey,

24:49.460 --> 24:51.900
everybody, welcome to my YouTube channel. If you want to keep the

24:51.900 --> 24:55.180
channel going. Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe. And

24:55.180 --> 24:55.500
today,

24:56.660 --> 24:58.820
a lot of them though have chapter markers on them now

24:58.820 --> 25:01.340
though. So that makes it better. That's good. We know I can skip

25:01.340 --> 25:02.460
the sheer space ads.

25:03.700 --> 25:07.740
See, bonds double six says at work now watching anime when I'm

25:07.740 --> 25:10.780
not working at some gaming or just regular adulting things.

25:12.140 --> 25:14.860
So all right. Yes,

25:14.900 --> 25:18.300
enough though. I am that person who pulls up YouTube to watch

25:18.300 --> 25:19.260
documentaries.

25:19.820 --> 25:22.860
Well, there is I mean, there is no shortage of all sorts of

25:22.860 --> 25:25.300
content on there. And there's some great gaming documentaries

25:25.300 --> 25:29.780
on there too. Like, I think of the Final Fantasy 14 1.0

25:29.780 --> 25:32.180
documentary that's on there. That's really good. You know,

25:32.740 --> 25:37.020
like, I like stuff like Did you know gaming and you know, unseen

25:37.020 --> 25:40.900
64. And I actually watched a really good one today about

25:42.020 --> 25:45.900
Stephen King stint as Richard Bachman, where the name came

25:45.900 --> 25:49.260
from, why he did it and about the controversy by the book

25:49.260 --> 25:49.820
rage.

25:51.020 --> 25:55.660
And it was a 20 minute video. And it gave the information and

25:55.660 --> 25:58.260
it was actually a really good video. Those are the that's what

25:58.260 --> 26:00.740
I go to watch is stuff that's going to teach me something.

26:00.780 --> 26:03.180
Well, for better or for worse, a site like YouTube with the

26:03.180 --> 26:06.100
search bar has everything. You know, if you need to know how to

26:06.100 --> 26:09.900
fix something, their algorithm sucks. Yeah, they will show you

26:09.900 --> 26:12.100
the same video you watched two months ago.

26:13.660 --> 26:18.740
Don't you want to see it again? All right. So until we have

26:18.740 --> 26:20.820
more, I guess that's all there is to say on Tick Tock getting

26:20.820 --> 26:23.980
into gaming is that they're testing it. I just don't know

26:23.980 --> 26:25.900
how much engagement they're really going to get with it

26:25.900 --> 26:28.220
unless they literally just dropped the game right in front

26:28.220 --> 26:31.500
of you as you're scrolling through all these endless things

26:31.500 --> 26:35.140
as you're looking at Tick Tock, I don't know. So yeah, I would

26:35.140 --> 26:39.660
have to like, you know, it. I don't know if they're doing

26:39.660 --> 26:42.180
anything meaningful with it, aside from just like, okay,

26:42.180 --> 26:43.980
we're going to advertise games on there. And then we'll split

26:43.980 --> 26:47.860
the revenue with whatever you guys sell or make off of it.

26:47.860 --> 26:51.500
Like, I don't know, I, I just don't see them doing anything

26:51.500 --> 26:54.340
meaningful with it. So far, like the other platforms, I've tried

26:54.340 --> 26:56.940
to integrate that stuff like Facebook and whatnot, haven't

26:56.940 --> 26:59.940
really done too much. Yeah, it's like, we'll have this news

26:59.940 --> 27:03.060
cycle. And then Oh, turns out, nobody's really engaging with

27:03.060 --> 27:07.540
it. So yeah, isn't that kind of true about Facebook gaming, the

27:07.540 --> 27:10.260
live streaming section to like, they, they, they'll get in the

27:10.260 --> 27:12.580
news, because it's like, oh, they've got all these creators.

27:12.780 --> 27:16.300
And as much as I don't really care for Facebook, but I also

27:16.300 --> 27:18.820
realized, like, I have to check it every now and then, or I'll

27:18.820 --> 27:21.020
miss people's major, like, I'll miss that people are getting

27:21.020 --> 27:25.060
married, and that type of stuff. So I'll load it up. But like,

27:25.060 --> 27:28.700
never, never do I see on my Facebook feed anything about

27:28.700 --> 27:33.180
Facebook gaming. And you would think Yeah, I mean, I'm not

27:33.180 --> 27:36.020
gonna watch it anyway. But you would think they'd be trying to

27:36.020 --> 27:41.300
target me a little bit. It's weird. Anyway. All right. Well,

27:41.300 --> 27:43.860
let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video

27:43.860 --> 27:45.940
games that we have been playing this week, the things we've been

27:45.940 --> 27:49.340
doing that aren't tick tock. How was your gaming week Dark

27:49.340 --> 27:50.300
Soccer? We'll start with you.

27:51.260 --> 27:54.980
Um, Terranigma is getting a little bit more interesting,

27:54.980 --> 28:00.620
although it's like still a fairly simple game. Like, the

28:00.620 --> 28:05.500
story is interesting, but it's so fucking weird. And like, I

28:05.500 --> 28:09.580
did have something good happen, like in in my my last stream, it

28:09.580 --> 28:13.660
was pretty cool. You have to go find this girl and they allude

28:13.660 --> 28:18.300
that she's surrounding herself with illusions. And then when

28:18.300 --> 28:21.260
you when you find her and you talk to the people in the town,

28:21.260 --> 28:24.500
and everyone's nice and you lay down at the end, and you wake up

28:24.500 --> 28:29.340
and there's all zombies trying to eat you and you can you can

28:29.380 --> 28:36.100
shoot their heads off and tables fly at you. And you there's

28:36.100 --> 28:39.740
these ghosts, like things that look almost like they almost

28:39.740 --> 28:44.180
remind me of Jomon pottery. But if you hit them, these ghosts

28:44.180 --> 28:46.380
come out and they like try they suck you back to the beginning

28:46.380 --> 28:51.980
of the level. So I've been using my safe states a lot. And like,

28:52.340 --> 28:55.460
you have to go find this girl's dog and all this stuff. And it's

28:55.460 --> 29:01.260
just this weird sort of denial thing going on in her with her

29:01.260 --> 29:04.460
little world of zombies. And I haven't found the girl yet. I

29:04.460 --> 29:10.180
think I did something out of turn. But it's a it's a really,

29:10.780 --> 29:14.540
the game has more depth than I thought it did at the beginning,

29:14.540 --> 29:25.380
even if the delivery is a little bit. Hmm. Awkward. Awkward

29:25.380 --> 29:30.540
delivery, I can put it forth like that, like you do. Like you

29:30.540 --> 29:34.300
wake up this one thing like you wake up all the animals in the

29:34.300 --> 29:37.820
world. And then suddenly you can talk to the animals and you have

29:37.820 --> 29:41.940
this weird cutscene that doesn't make any sense. And I just a lot

29:41.940 --> 29:45.900
of it just is really awkward. And I can see why it didn't come

29:45.900 --> 29:49.820
out over here. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but I have

29:49.820 --> 29:56.620
played better put together games in general. The music is is okay.

29:57.700 --> 30:03.540
There have been some pieces that I translate them as really bad.

30:03.540 --> 30:07.420
So they're interesting to listen to. Like the instrumentation and

30:07.420 --> 30:09.420
some of them is weird. And I found some music I really enjoyed

30:09.420 --> 30:14.140
and I like the animations for the main character arc. And I

30:14.140 --> 30:17.940
like his little like, purple blob thing that just shows up

30:17.940 --> 30:23.340
out of out of nowhere to be sarcastic to him named Yomi. So

30:23.700 --> 30:29.620
I'm enjoying the game. It's just not what I expected it to be.

30:30.740 --> 30:33.940
But it's it's pretty fun. I'm so I'm gonna keep up with it. I

30:33.940 --> 30:36.540
mean, I think I'm kind of pushing through it at a good

30:36.540 --> 30:43.100
pace. And of course, Dead by Daylight. I play I ended up

30:43.100 --> 30:45.940
like I don't even know what my deal was yesterday, but I could

30:45.940 --> 30:51.740
not play my best characters to save my life. And then I'm

30:51.740 --> 30:55.020
actually starting to see now where I'm getting loading screen

30:55.020 --> 30:58.180
lag that a lot of people on Steam are also getting and the

30:58.180 --> 31:02.580
rubber banding that they've been talking about. Where it's like,

31:02.860 --> 31:05.860
you you're chasing after someone, for example, and then

31:05.860 --> 31:09.900
it snaps, like it snaps you back, like another position like

31:09.900 --> 31:14.700
you've been pulled back by rubber band. And I don't know

31:14.700 --> 31:19.060
what it is, because Finara and I were talking about it. And

31:19.060 --> 31:24.100
Finara, I will be getting to that. Thank you. Is that the

31:24.100 --> 31:26.980
toxic survivors, the bully squads have been out in force.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.780
And although I did have something really funny happen on

31:30.780 --> 31:34.580
Thursday, I finally got to play Haddonfield, which I haven't, I

31:34.580 --> 31:37.020
haven't played it yet, except for the time Finara and I ran

31:37.020 --> 31:41.540
around exploring. And it was clear, I didn't know where I was

31:41.540 --> 31:45.820
going. And the survivors started to be, you know, bullyish and

31:45.820 --> 31:48.300
everything. And as I like to say, they fucked around and

31:48.300 --> 31:54.140
found out. They got sloppy, I got on my game. One person

31:54.140 --> 32:01.300
disconnected to, to Death Hooks. And I felt sorry for the UE at

32:01.300 --> 32:04.340
the end and I let her escape. I let her get the hatch. I

32:04.340 --> 32:07.300
couldn't find the hatch though. That Haddonfield level is small,

32:07.300 --> 32:13.380
but weird. I don't hate it. But I miss old Haddonfield and I

32:13.380 --> 32:18.140
never thought I would say that. Yeah, it's very different. But

32:18.140 --> 32:22.380
other than that, I've been watching people on the PTB. The

32:22.380 --> 32:27.660
dredge, haha. That, that's a very interesting character

32:27.660 --> 32:32.060
concept. And I super love it, except he just, he reminds me a

32:32.060 --> 32:36.620
little bit of some of the scenes from The Thing. And that

32:36.620 --> 32:40.180
is a movie I cannot watch because I had bad nightmares

32:40.180 --> 32:42.660
about it. Like I cannot watch that movie and the dredge makes

32:42.660 --> 32:44.980
me think a little bit of it. But the locker teleporting

32:44.980 --> 32:48.500
mechanic is really cool. And now, you know, I'm a lore nerd.

32:48.940 --> 32:52.380
I've probably read through everybody's stories and the

32:52.380 --> 32:57.980
extra things. And I really liked that they brought Hattie into

32:57.980 --> 33:04.060
it because she was mentioned in three other tomes before we even

33:04.060 --> 33:09.060
saw her. And then there was like the Jacob person that she was

33:09.060 --> 33:12.140
writing to also mentioned in the lore. And then I think there was

33:12.140 --> 33:18.020
something about the person who basically created the doctor. So

33:18.020 --> 33:20.820
I really think that now they're starting to look a little bit

33:20.820 --> 33:24.820
more to their actual lore and starting to tie it all together.

33:25.140 --> 33:28.140
Because I think that there's a big contingent of us that's

33:28.140 --> 33:31.660
really into the lore. And we want to see these things, we want

33:31.660 --> 33:36.740
them to expand on it. Well, I did also buy another game and I

33:36.740 --> 33:41.700
cannot play it. I bought Evil Dead. Right now, now it's only

33:41.700 --> 33:49.100
on Epic Games Store if you want it on a non console. And they

33:49.100 --> 33:52.740
marked it down to like 39. And then they're doing like some

33:52.740 --> 33:57.060
mega sale right now where you can get a $10 off coupon. So I

33:57.060 --> 34:01.140
paid 30 bucks for the game. So I'm not going to return it. But

34:01.140 --> 34:06.140
it won't run in Windows 11 arm. It doesn't the x64 emulation is

34:06.140 --> 34:08.380
not where it should be to run that game. Of course, I still

34:08.380 --> 34:11.460
have the same problem with Dead by Daylight that I know the game

34:11.460 --> 34:15.540
will run. I know the game will work. It's the anti cheat that

34:15.540 --> 34:18.180
they use that won't run and the game will not run without the

34:18.180 --> 34:24.180
anti cheat. So I'm hoping that the Evil Dead comes out on

34:24.180 --> 34:27.020
Stadia because I'll probably buy it again. It looked like I

34:27.020 --> 34:34.180
watched LC play it last night. It was that shit. It's intense.

34:34.620 --> 34:38.940
And it looked like it was a lot of fun. So I'm one of these days

34:38.940 --> 34:41.460
I'll get to play it but I did put a lot of attention into it.

34:42.700 --> 34:46.300
So that's right out in word scapes like I'm number 12 in

34:46.300 --> 34:47.740
the tournament today. So whatever.

34:48.180 --> 34:52.660
All right. Loki, we'll go to you. How was your gaming week?

34:53.340 --> 34:59.140
I was just Minecraft again. So I put out a new hardcore video.

34:59.140 --> 35:04.020
And then I've been trying to get a farm, a raid farm to work, or

35:04.020 --> 35:06.540
at least a stacking rate farm to work. But the server that we

35:06.540 --> 35:11.900
play on, it had its runs what's called paper MC and paper tends

35:11.900 --> 35:17.100
to mess with technical redstone stuff. And so I built the farm

35:17.100 --> 35:21.100
up and it didn't work quite right. So I had to tear it all

35:21.100 --> 35:25.820
down again. And so now I'm researching new farm designs to

35:25.860 --> 35:32.100
build. So there's that. Um, what else? Oh, I got this cool new

35:32.100 --> 35:34.900
t shirt. I gotta show you. So you're gonna love this. I mean,

35:35.180 --> 35:38.300
so check this out. See if we can move my mic.

35:38.420 --> 35:40.220
Was that a pyramid head? I can't tell.

35:40.580 --> 35:41.100
No.

35:41.620 --> 35:45.580
Yeah, your green screen is green is the virtual green

35:45.580 --> 35:45.980
screen.

35:48.540 --> 35:50.540
Here, we'll fix that real quick. All right.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.460
And by the way, can I mention one thing that I forgot to?

35:53.500 --> 35:57.780
Yeah. I chased finara around in cold wind farm so I could

35:57.780 --> 36:01.900
practice nurse. Oh, fun. And listening to a thing screen

36:01.900 --> 36:02.620
makes me happy.

36:03.860 --> 36:07.180
Oh, gosh, that's also okay. So that's like, that's the

36:07.220 --> 36:11.940
background for dropout. The old DDR song. It is. Oh, wow. That's

36:11.980 --> 36:15.020
that is. Where did you get that shirt from?

36:15.900 --> 36:17.220
T Republic, I believe.

36:17.700 --> 36:20.620
I'm gonna have to look at that. Yeah, that's, that's a throwback.

36:20.900 --> 36:21.580
My gosh.

36:21.620 --> 36:27.460
Yeah. Yeah. It was from they just sent me an email. I think

36:27.460 --> 36:28.540
it's frontier public.

36:28.980 --> 36:31.580
I'm a little shocked that I recognized it, but also not.

36:33.940 --> 36:35.260
All right. Anything else?

36:35.260 --> 36:36.780
I thought I had to get it. Anything else?

36:37.860 --> 36:40.020
That that's basically it. Yeah. Okay.

36:41.020 --> 36:45.500
Let's see. My gaming week. I've been playing more fun fancy 14

36:45.500 --> 36:47.660
because of course I have been. I've been playing a little bit

36:47.660 --> 36:50.420
of dead by daylight as well. I've been sort of trying to get

36:50.420 --> 36:52.620
back into killer a little bit. I have found that I kind of

36:52.620 --> 36:56.580
enjoyed playing the plague right now in dead by daylight. I feel

36:56.580 --> 37:00.500
like she inherently counters a lot of the meta plays that

37:00.500 --> 37:04.580
survivors use right now. Because like, healing circle of healing

37:04.620 --> 37:07.900
doesn't really matter with her. Because her mechanic is the

37:07.900 --> 37:11.100
whole cleansing and everything anyway, anyway, dead hard. You

37:11.100 --> 37:14.820
can still vomit on them if they did hard. So there's there's a

37:14.820 --> 37:18.780
lot that, you know, kind of works with her that I find very

37:18.780 --> 37:23.060
fun. I just find most survivors aren't prepared for her. So

37:23.060 --> 37:25.860
that's the fun thing about playing her not to say I got

37:25.860 --> 37:29.780
some four K's I get some no K's just you know, kind of goes back

37:29.780 --> 37:31.380
and forth. My luck with her.

37:31.940 --> 37:34.340
He always used to throw me off because of how tall she is.

37:34.940 --> 37:39.300
Oh, yeah, there's that. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Ah, let's

37:39.300 --> 37:42.820
see. And then in other games, so I'm continuing my, you know,

37:42.820 --> 37:47.460
adventures in AR gaming and like Pikmin. I'm level 57 in

37:47.460 --> 37:51.020
Pikmin Bloom now. So I've walked a lot of steps. I just walked

37:51.020 --> 37:56.180
three and a half miles today in the heat. So that's, that's been

37:56.420 --> 37:58.540
you know, I don't know, because that's a very passive type of

37:58.540 --> 38:01.980
game. I don't do a lot in that game. But they had a big

38:01.980 --> 38:04.540
community day because Niantic had a big community day this

38:04.540 --> 38:08.340
weekend. And actually, some of my friends through Ingress, we

38:08.340 --> 38:12.460
decided to meet up in Oakland. Because well, they weren't doing

38:12.460 --> 38:14.900
anything for Ingress, but we all play the other stuff too. So we

38:14.900 --> 38:19.740
decided to do Pikmin there and they were doing Pokemon Go had a

38:19.740 --> 38:24.100
community day. So they were doing Alolan Geodude as well.

38:24.120 --> 38:27.020
Oh, yeah, Mike Defton chat says all the community days. Well,

38:27.020 --> 38:31.540
Niantic Niantic starting to lean into that a little bit. And they

38:31.540 --> 38:34.100
actually they even have a whole website for community day. And

38:34.100 --> 38:37.300
they're they've launched a whole brand around it. So Niantic

38:37.300 --> 38:41.740
actually had a booth in Oakland. And so it was it was considered

38:41.740 --> 38:45.460
one of the like Niantic attended events. They did some

38:45.460 --> 38:48.640
virtual events, but this was like Niantic intended, attended.

38:48.740 --> 38:51.580
So they had a booth set up with like, it was just silly stuff

38:51.580 --> 38:55.300
like pins, but one of the pins I got was a Niantic community day

38:55.300 --> 38:58.460
pin with that new logo on it and everything. So I mean, they're

38:58.460 --> 39:01.740
they're leaning into the brand. They had like Wayfarer stickers

39:01.740 --> 39:04.500
and stuff. So you can kind of see all their their new products

39:04.500 --> 39:07.380
are trying to kind of fold into their brand in different ways.

39:07.740 --> 39:11.260
And then, yeah, so I did the community day there and just,

39:11.260 --> 39:13.900
you know, walked around a little bit. It was interesting because

39:13.900 --> 39:19.700
they had, they put in like 10 fake pokey stops right in that

39:19.700 --> 39:22.500
Jack London Square, which is a pretty decently populated area

39:22.500 --> 39:25.620
with pokey stops anyway. And they added like 10 more. So it

39:25.620 --> 39:28.620
was like I was just sitting there because I use the Bluetooth

39:28.620 --> 39:31.940
and when I ran out of pokey balls, I just switch it to only

39:31.940 --> 39:35.180
spin stops. And within like 10 minutes, I probably had 100

39:35.180 --> 39:38.980
pokey balls again. So it's also interesting. And we'll get into

39:38.980 --> 39:41.420
some of the Niantic controversy later. But it is very

39:41.420 --> 39:45.980
interesting how they can set up fake pokey stops whenever they

39:45.980 --> 39:49.500
want wherever they want. So it's that part of it's kind of

39:49.500 --> 39:54.220
interesting. But it was honestly like I it was kind of lame for

39:54.220 --> 39:56.860
Pikmin though, because Pikmin didn't generate the flower

39:56.860 --> 40:02.380
spawns. It didn't generate off the the stops that they made for

40:02.380 --> 40:04.940
the event. So it was like there wasn't very many places to spawn

40:04.940 --> 40:08.100
flowers. So it was really just Pokemon. And so for my friends

40:08.380 --> 40:10.740
they play Pikmin and Ingress, they don't really play Pokemon.

40:10.940 --> 40:14.140
They were a little bit like, there's not much to do. But it

40:14.140 --> 40:16.500
was fun to see everybody and hang out together. And I guess

40:16.700 --> 40:22.300
that's that's the fun in it. So yeah, so outside of that, don't

40:22.300 --> 40:26.020
really have a lot else to share. I Oh, no, I guess I could

40:26.020 --> 40:30.540
mention that Pokemon home got an upgrade. Because now Pokemon

40:30.540 --> 40:36.020
home will work with Arceus and brilliant diamond shining pearl.

40:36.300 --> 40:39.020
So all I've really done so far as I went into home to like

40:39.020 --> 40:41.900
organize some stuff and do a little bit of transfers, I

40:41.900 --> 40:45.180
upgraded my save files and did the transfers to get the bonus

40:45.180 --> 40:48.460
Pokemon that they're given away for the home upgrade. But if

40:48.460 --> 40:52.380
you're a Pokemon person, and you like home at all, just check out

40:52.380 --> 40:56.460
that that all got upgraded to 2.0. And now you can use it with

40:56.660 --> 41:00.260
the two latest Pokemon releases, because you can only use it with

41:00.260 --> 41:04.180
really sword and shield and go and and transferring stuff all

41:04.180 --> 41:06.620
the way from bank before you can really use it with the newer

41:06.620 --> 41:09.380
games, but they've now patched it in. So you can use it with

41:09.380 --> 41:12.780
the newer releases. So that kind of makes that stuff fresh again,

41:13.020 --> 41:17.500
I really need to go back and beat Pokemon Arceus because that

41:17.500 --> 41:20.340
was all right when I was moving. So I was really into it for like

41:20.340 --> 41:23.300
a week. And then it was like the move took over and I never went

41:23.300 --> 41:28.700
back to it. So I need to do that at some point. All right, let's

41:28.700 --> 41:32.620
get into some more news. Not a lot of housekeeping stuff. But I

41:32.620 --> 41:36.260
will mention because we're getting close now. We're only a

41:36.260 --> 41:39.220
month away from our 20th anniversary here of Orange

41:39.220 --> 41:43.340
Launch Radio, we celebrate 20 years on the air for better. And

41:43.340 --> 41:47.660
for worse. At the end of June, June 26 will be that show are

41:47.660 --> 41:50.540
technically our birthday is June 23. But that would be in the

41:50.540 --> 41:53.380
middle of the week. So we're going to do a celebrate all that

41:53.380 --> 41:59.460
on June the 26th. So be here. All right. Let's talk about news

41:59.460 --> 42:02.220
and what else is going on in the gaming world. Loki?

42:03.380 --> 42:08.500
Yeah, so apparently, the word is that EA is looking for somebody

42:08.500 --> 42:13.460
to swoop in and purchase them. Because you know, hey, that's

42:13.460 --> 42:14.100
what's happening.

42:17.420 --> 42:21.540
So they said in recent years, as media companies have taken

42:21.540 --> 42:24.940
greater interest in the rapidly growing gaming industry.

42:25.780 --> 42:29.300
Electronic Arts have held talks with a number of different

42:29.300 --> 42:32.540
potential suitors, including Disney, Apple and Amazon.

42:34.220 --> 42:39.300
Several sources with these talks say EA has been persistent in

42:39.300 --> 42:43.780
pursuing a sale and has only grown more emboldened in the

42:43.780 --> 42:46.220
wake of the Microsoft Activision deal.

42:50.220 --> 42:55.100
Yeah, but like, maybe they don't like don't have the offer

42:55.100 --> 42:58.140
they're like your games like Battlefield hasn't been doing

42:58.140 --> 42:58.640
well.

43:00.380 --> 43:03.300
Madden stuff, I guess it's all right. You just lost your FIFA

43:03.300 --> 43:07.100
license, or maybe just didn't renew your FIFA license,

43:07.100 --> 43:07.620
whatever.

43:09.740 --> 43:13.220
So I don't know. I don't know if anyone will will purchase them.

43:13.220 --> 43:18.860
But I guess they're just saying, Hey, we're out here, waiting for

43:18.860 --> 43:19.980
you to purchase us.

43:22.300 --> 43:25.100
Well, that's the I guess that list of suitors is kind of

43:25.100 --> 43:28.100
interesting. I mean, because they're not really companies you

43:28.100 --> 43:31.340
think about with gaming. I mean, I get the Apple one I get

43:31.340 --> 43:34.500
because I see where they've got gaming, the Disney one, I guess

43:34.500 --> 43:36.820
Disney did have some game publishing.

43:39.420 --> 43:43.260
Yeah, yeah, they're interested in more licensing than developing

43:43.260 --> 43:48.060
their games. So so but then the Comcast one is very like, I

43:48.060 --> 43:53.020
mean, a lot of people are quick to point out, you know, the two

43:53.020 --> 43:57.860
most hated companies in America are probably Comcast and EA. You

43:57.860 --> 44:00.500
know, if you look at those, you know, when when it comes to

44:00.500 --> 44:03.540
battle for the Oh, who's the worst company in the world? It's

44:03.540 --> 44:06.300
usually those two are towards the top of the list. So it was

44:06.300 --> 44:10.500
just together we can be the worst we'll combine our powers

44:10.500 --> 44:14.580
of being the worst to be the even worse company. I don't

44:14.580 --> 44:18.180
know. I'm, I'm not sure how EA would fit into that unless

44:18.180 --> 44:21.500
Comcast to be more worse or rare, unless Comcast wants to

44:21.500 --> 44:26.300
start publishing games. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know where

44:26.300 --> 44:29.220
that fits in with it. Well, it's not gonna happen anyway. But it

44:29.220 --> 44:31.940
could it could be that they just want to be purchased and then

44:31.940 --> 44:34.900
they could still be making games but just like owned by another

44:34.900 --> 44:38.380
company kind of like how we just had the acquisitions with some

44:38.380 --> 44:42.180
of Square Enix's properties, where they're owned by another

44:42.180 --> 44:45.260
company now, then they're still making games. It's just they're

44:45.260 --> 44:48.100
not making games for Square Enix anymore. There. There's another

44:48.100 --> 44:51.420
parent company that basically owns them. Yeah, it'd be nice

44:51.420 --> 44:53.460
if someone threw billions of dollars your way, but

44:53.500 --> 44:58.300
unfortunately, that's not happening right now. Would it be

44:58.340 --> 45:01.060
like a big deal if Sony purchased them?

45:02.220 --> 45:05.700
Um, I don't know me No, I am. But yeah, probably.

45:06.060 --> 45:08.260
Personally, it's gonna be different for everyone. Will it

45:08.260 --> 45:11.740
make huge news in the industry? Absolutely. But it sounds to me

45:11.740 --> 45:14.980
and especially kind of based on you know, the the feedback of

45:14.980 --> 45:19.220
the EA feels emboldened by the Activision Microsoft thing. I

45:19.220 --> 45:23.260
would bet EA is trying to ask for too much money for what

45:23.260 --> 45:26.100
they're really worth. And you kind of are pointing out that a

45:26.100 --> 45:30.860
lot of their longtime franchises are not exactly taking a turn

45:30.860 --> 45:33.460
for the better. And as more and more people are getting burned

45:33.460 --> 45:36.260
out on the whole loot box thing and you see more regulation with

45:36.260 --> 45:39.620
that when EA says this is where we make most of our money. I

45:39.620 --> 45:42.620
think buying EA could be a dangerous prospect for many

45:42.620 --> 45:46.060
people right now, especially now that they just lost the FIFA

45:46.060 --> 45:49.220
license. And although I think most of us that don't think that

45:49.220 --> 45:52.460
they net Yeah, I think that they I think with FIFA, they're just

45:52.500 --> 45:54.700
now just licensing the football clubs.

45:55.740 --> 45:59.540
And if you let me get to the point I would have, but most of

45:59.540 --> 46:03.820
the, you know, the the EA stuff, they'll be fine without FIFA, I

46:03.820 --> 46:07.660
really do think they will be. But just the fact that they are

46:07.700 --> 46:11.660
they lost that is not a great look, you know, for a company

46:11.660 --> 46:14.660
that's trying to sell themselves. Now they can't say

46:14.660 --> 46:17.300
and we've got FIFA license for it, because they don't have it

46:17.300 --> 46:20.900
anymore. You know, so I guess I think they'll be fine. Those of

46:20.900 --> 46:22.580
us that have followed the industry in those games for a

46:22.580 --> 46:25.100
while. Yes, they've, they've partnered with other soccer

46:25.100 --> 46:27.620
clubs. And I really think FIFA will probably lose more from

46:27.620 --> 46:31.780
that deal than EA will, but that's that's on them. So yeah,

46:31.780 --> 46:34.820
they'll be fine. But I'm not sure investors see it that way.

46:35.660 --> 46:38.340
We got this other company Konami, they're gonna make a

46:38.340 --> 46:41.900
soccer game. It's gonna be amazing. Oh, wait.

46:41.900 --> 46:47.820
Talk about somebody who ought to be sold. But that's a whole

46:47.820 --> 46:49.820
nother story, I suppose. So

46:49.860 --> 46:52.780
I must talk about a company that doesn't have anything of value

46:52.780 --> 46:53.300
anymore.

46:54.260 --> 46:57.620
Uh, quest buster and chat says from what I've read, the game

46:57.620 --> 47:01.020
industry will blow past 200 billion in revenues by 2024,

47:01.020 --> 47:03.780
which could partially explain why a company like Comcast once

47:03.780 --> 47:07.180
an in Vivendi specialty is entertainment media like canal

47:07.180 --> 47:10.420
plus in France, but once upon a time they owned Activision

47:10.460 --> 47:13.300
Blizzard. Yes, it actually was not that long ago, really. So

47:13.300 --> 47:14.300
yeah, it's very true.

47:15.860 --> 47:19.420
S2100. Matt says I could have seen it. The EA game console

47:19.420 --> 47:23.100
presented by Comcast, a cloud gaming console that won't be

47:23.100 --> 47:25.020
subjected to bandwidth caps.

47:26.260 --> 47:30.220
I hate that idea so much, but I could see it.

47:31.580 --> 47:33.140
For sure. So

47:34.260 --> 47:35.260
thanks. I hate it.

47:35.300 --> 47:38.740
Thanks. I hate it. Yep, pretty much. Yeah, we'll see. I mean,

47:38.740 --> 47:43.100
if they decide to sell. But meanwhile, there's other stuff

47:43.100 --> 47:44.180
going on at EA, right?

47:45.220 --> 47:47.980
Yeah, so along with that consolidation,

47:48.980 --> 47:55.380
with the losing or not renewing their contract with FIFA, they

47:55.380 --> 48:00.060
are now having layoffs at EA Austin, where they're dropping

48:00.060 --> 48:02.780
200 or more customer support staff

48:03.860 --> 48:05.780
that have been helping out with stuff there.

48:06.380 --> 48:09.580
Again, not a great Well, I don't know sometimes

48:10.620 --> 48:14.220
cutting back. I hate I hate to say it that way. Because, you

48:14.220 --> 48:16.660
know, these are people that lost their jobs and so forth. But I'm

48:16.660 --> 48:20.020
just speaking strictly like the investor side of things. Those

48:20.020 --> 48:23.020
sort of cutbacks make a company a little more lucrative to that

48:23.020 --> 48:24.620
sort of stuff, too.

48:24.700 --> 48:28.540
Yeah, basically, they're taking it from in house and they're

48:28.540 --> 48:31.140
going to be using a third party, I guess,

48:31.580 --> 48:35.940
which means 100% full stop guaranteed customer service is

48:35.940 --> 48:40.340
only going to get worse. Absolutely, it will get worse.

48:40.540 --> 48:43.340
Because if you think customer service doesn't do shit for you

48:43.340 --> 48:46.900
now, when it comes to restoring old accounts, or you were banned

48:46.900 --> 48:50.300
inappropriately, just wait until a third party does it that

48:50.300 --> 48:51.980
doesn't even have the proper access to

48:52.380 --> 48:54.420
they're going to Romania and India.

48:54.460 --> 48:59.820
They Oh, this is gonna be garbage, like, good fucking luck

48:59.900 --> 49:04.020
for those of you that have a lot invested in EA online games. You

49:04.020 --> 49:06.180
know, I don't know, maybe if you if you're playing Star Wars,

49:06.180 --> 49:08.940
the old republic or something that like you're continuously

49:08.940 --> 49:12.060
hitting EA products, or maybe dropping a lot of money on FIFA

49:12.060 --> 49:15.660
or what have you. Good fucking luck if you need customer

49:15.660 --> 49:21.340
service help, because that's Oh, boy, that's gonna be rough.

49:23.580 --> 49:28.500
Anyway, let's talk about a gaming series, the dark soccer

49:28.500 --> 49:32.580
and I talk a little bit about on this show just a tad, a little

49:32.620 --> 49:34.740
a little bit. So we're gonna talk a little bit about dead by

49:34.740 --> 49:37.460
daylight. But that's because there's actually a lot of news

49:37.460 --> 49:40.580
going on with dead by daylight is that they just had their six

49:40.580 --> 49:44.140
anniversary celebration stream, you know, kind of announcing

49:44.140 --> 49:46.780
what's coming up for the sixth anniversary event that's

49:46.780 --> 49:49.180
happening in June, where dark soccer kind of already

49:49.180 --> 49:51.460
referenced, you have a new killer, you have a new survivor

49:51.460 --> 49:54.620
that are on the public test build right now. But did you

49:54.620 --> 49:55.460
watch the whole thing?

49:56.460 --> 49:59.300
No, I didn't watch any of it. I only read secondhand the cliff

49:59.300 --> 50:02.020
notes. I watched all of it. Yeah, well, I was working so I

50:02.020 --> 50:04.500
couldn't I couldn't watch it. But I watched it after the fact.

50:04.540 --> 50:08.900
Okay, that's cool. Yeah. Um, but I did see this trailer and

50:08.900 --> 50:11.380
something that came a little bit out of left field a little bit

50:11.380 --> 50:15.020
not. But I think for those that hadn't been paying attention to

50:15.020 --> 50:18.260
every little rumor, this did come out of left field. And that

50:18.260 --> 50:21.740
is that dead by daylight is officially launching a dating

50:21.740 --> 50:25.380
sim. And it's called hooked on you, which is a very tongue on

50:25.380 --> 50:28.260
tongue in cheek name. Because of course, in dead by daylight,

50:28.300 --> 50:33.020
if you're a killer, you are placing survivors on a hook. If

50:33.020 --> 50:36.420
you're a killer, you're a hooker. Yeah. So hooked on you

50:36.420 --> 50:39.020
is the name of the obviously there's that play on dating.

50:39.820 --> 50:44.780
This is being made by psy op, who made the I love you Colonel

50:44.780 --> 50:48.780
Sanders dating sim. So you know, this is a company that got a

50:48.780 --> 50:53.460
pedigree. Yeah, they would. They're gonna do fine with it.

50:54.220 --> 50:58.860
They interviewed the guy behind it. And he was absolutely

50:58.860 --> 51:01.980
hilarious. He's like, Well, I know this is normally serious

51:01.980 --> 51:04.180
and very lethal. And we want to pay respect for that. But let's

51:04.180 --> 51:08.380
make it silly. It was it was actually really worth watching.

51:08.580 --> 51:12.980
That's cool. Um, yeah. And it this is just funny to me.

51:12.980 --> 51:16.500
Because if you go to the dead by daylight, Twitter, which it has

51:16.500 --> 51:18.660
a weird name, you would think they'd just be at dead by

51:18.660 --> 51:22.900
daylight, but it's like, D by behavior, so dead by behavior,

51:22.900 --> 51:27.300
bh vr. Yeah. So you have to go to that Twitter. If you look at

51:27.300 --> 51:31.500
the replies to literally any tweet they've ever posted, the

51:31.500 --> 51:34.780
replies will always have in the one of the first five replies

51:34.780 --> 51:38.540
will always be when are you adding sex to dead by daylight

51:38.580 --> 51:43.820
or sex when or when can I sex Dwight or you know, David or

51:43.820 --> 51:49.020
whoever is the killer or survivor being posted about. And

51:49.020 --> 51:52.900
I feel like in a way as much as this daylight, or excuse me,

51:52.900 --> 51:55.300
this dead by daylight dating sim is funny and good news. I feel

51:55.300 --> 51:57.980
like it's rewarding that behavior on Twitter is that all

51:57.980 --> 52:01.660
those people not a little bit not that you're gonna have sex

52:01.660 --> 52:05.020
in this game, but I do feel that those people are vindicated a

52:05.020 --> 52:11.420
little bit, which kind of irritates me. So but anyway, um,

52:12.780 --> 52:16.660
on a murderer's island, we're hooked on you takes place, you

52:16.660 --> 52:20.540
will get to know four of the killers in the game, the trapper

52:20.580 --> 52:24.740
huntress, wraith and spirit. And you will romance them and

52:24.740 --> 52:27.540
apparently might be wondering which survivor Do you play as my

52:27.540 --> 52:29.500
understanding is you play as yourself. You don't play as a

52:29.500 --> 52:32.900
survivor. So the survivors flat out you play as an original

52:32.900 --> 52:35.580
character. Yeah. So the survivors may show up in cameos

52:35.580 --> 52:39.740
or something, but you're gonna play as yourself. And it's gonna

52:39.740 --> 52:42.780
be in a locker. Yeah. And there's, you know, there's men

52:42.780 --> 52:45.580
and women. So it's a for four people. It's a pretty diverse

52:45.580 --> 52:49.540
lineup there. It's all dead by daylight behavior entertainment

52:49.540 --> 52:52.020
originals. So you're not going to be romancing Mike Myers or

52:52.020 --> 52:54.060
Freddie or any of that stuff. But I'm sure we can all

52:54.060 --> 52:57.740
understand why, you know, those licenses only go so far, they

52:57.740 --> 53:00.340
would have to license those care. So if this dating sim does

53:00.340 --> 53:04.540
really well, maybe we'll get nemesis in it because it seems

53:04.540 --> 53:08.220
like Capcom is very eager to license right now. The one thing

53:08.220 --> 53:12.300
we haven't talked about, they also confirmed a second resident

53:12.300 --> 53:16.540
evil DLC is on the way, which getting Ada Wong, which has not

53:16.540 --> 53:19.980
happened for with it. Technically, they haven't

53:19.980 --> 53:22.900
confirmed that. But wink, wink, nudge, nudge, the leakers that

53:22.900 --> 53:25.680
said this was coming said it's Ada Wong and Wesker. And the

53:25.680 --> 53:29.620
trailer VD leaks has been fairly accurate. And the information I

53:29.620 --> 53:32.900
mean, it's called project W and the trailer was just screaming

53:32.900 --> 53:36.700
that it's Wesker. So I don't see Yeah, how Yeah, so I'm sure I'm

53:36.700 --> 53:41.460
sure it is Ada Wong. It's a bummer. I don't I guess it's not

53:41.460 --> 53:43.620
to though. It's just Oh, no, it is to it's somebody from

53:43.620 --> 53:47.300
Resident Evil zero. It's another feet. Rebecca or something

53:47.300 --> 53:49.460
right was the other way back chambers. She's actually was in

53:49.460 --> 53:53.380
the first Resident Evil. Okay, okay. My bad. She was when you

53:53.380 --> 53:57.420
played through Chris's game. She was his kind of sidekick back

53:57.420 --> 54:02.940
and forth. And played the piano for that one scene and and she

54:02.940 --> 54:08.900
was though in another game with was it Carlos? Some other guy.

54:09.860 --> 54:12.260
Oh, she's also in zero says Mike Depp. Okay, so we're both

54:12.260 --> 54:17.380
right. That's my fan. Um, it's I'm a little bummed that Chris

54:17.420 --> 54:19.820
is not going to be a fully fledged character. He's always

54:19.820 --> 54:22.380
just going to be an alternate Leon, but whatever. I guess you

54:22.380 --> 54:26.980
can't win them all. So. But yeah, so there's another

54:26.980 --> 54:31.140
Resident Evil DLC coming. Also, I really wanted the killer to be

54:31.140 --> 54:36.580
Lady Dimitrescu. And I know I know Wesker. I know Wesker is

54:36.580 --> 54:39.060
maybe a third one show. Yeah, maybe a third one since

54:39.060 --> 54:41.900
apparently Capcom is, you know, bargain basementing that out

54:41.900 --> 54:45.340
right now. But I imagine it's I imagine that DLC sold really

54:45.340 --> 54:49.540
well. And it's probably done a lot for you know, people love

54:49.540 --> 54:53.940
it. So I think probably sees the win there. Don't forget about

54:53.940 --> 54:56.340
the other news with that they're going to be doing revamps to

54:56.660 --> 54:59.700
RuPaul's Drag Station. Oh, the Raccoon City Police Department,

54:59.700 --> 55:02.780
the worst map. Yeah, that needs that is not the worst map. It's

55:02.780 --> 55:05.940
my favorite map to play on his pig and Freddie as the worst map

55:05.940 --> 55:08.380
for a survivor, I think. Well, I don't know. No, a lot of

55:08.380 --> 55:11.340
survivors love it because they it's like a terrible map for

55:11.340 --> 55:15.700
because of the library. That's it because of the library. But

55:16.980 --> 55:21.260
I love getting RPD as pig. It's like my favorite thing is

55:21.260 --> 55:25.500
getting RPD as pig. So well, how do you feel that they're

55:25.500 --> 55:28.900
reworking it? Because it might not go and, you know, I know you

55:28.900 --> 55:32.380
love to do the extra trap and all that stuff to get survivors

55:32.420 --> 55:34.100
in that map, but they may

55:34.340 --> 55:38.820
did actually play this trap or two and it was pretty fun. But

55:39.820 --> 55:45.980
I think that I want them to keep this original layout like they

55:45.980 --> 55:49.340
have but if they do other maps that you have a chance to get

55:50.060 --> 55:54.780
that maybe have different things restricted or different openings

55:54.780 --> 55:58.620
or different pathways, you know, kind of like how there's like

55:58.620 --> 56:02.780
what 50,000 versions of batam. Yeah. And they all are pretty

56:02.780 --> 56:07.100
much the fucking same. I think this is gonna be more of that. I

56:07.100 --> 56:11.580
honestly do. Oh, there's more pulsing shit everywhere. Oh,

56:11.580 --> 56:17.060
this there's a tentacle in the wall. Oh, I'm so scared. Oh, no.

56:17.100 --> 56:19.420
Oh, this one doesn't have the hole in the wall from the

56:19.420 --> 56:20.700
helicopter. Ooh.

56:22.100 --> 56:26.180
I would like to see another Silent Hill DLC. But I don't

56:26.180 --> 56:31.340
know what other killer they could put. Because they made the

56:31.500 --> 56:32.740
most obvious one a survivor.

56:33.540 --> 56:38.380
I would want them to do like the original mansion. I know it's

56:38.380 --> 56:41.380
too big, but I would like for them to do like different areas

56:41.380 --> 56:45.780
of the mansion. Cool. Cool. From the first Resident Evil. And if

56:45.780 --> 56:50.940
they did a Silent Hill one, I would want it to be the mall

56:50.940 --> 56:54.660
that Heather is trapped in in Silent Hill three. It's just

56:54.660 --> 56:56.860
the room Cheryl, Heather, Cheryl, whatever.

56:57.180 --> 57:00.700
Now, um, I don't know if we have a release date for hooked on

57:00.700 --> 57:03.820
you. We just know it's Oh, later this summer. That's what

57:03.820 --> 57:07.020
we know. And that it's coming to steam. So I don't think we have

57:07.020 --> 57:10.460
any other platforms yet. But you know, the going theory is July.

57:10.620 --> 57:12.900
Yeah. Which would make sense. That's right around their

57:12.900 --> 57:16.540
anniversary and all that stuff. Now, Loki, I know you don't get

57:16.540 --> 57:19.460
into Dead by Daylight the same way Dark Soccer and I do. But I

57:19.460 --> 57:23.380
have to ask, could a dating sim sell you on Dead by Daylight?

57:24.020 --> 57:24.420
No.

57:25.340 --> 57:26.740
Why not? You're no fun.

57:27.260 --> 57:30.460
I don't really play dating sims. So that wouldn't really

57:30.460 --> 57:34.180
maybe your wife would get into Dead by Daylight. Probably not.

57:34.820 --> 57:38.300
All right. Dark Soccer. I'm sure you'll be sure I'm sure every

57:38.300 --> 57:40.540
Dead by Daylight streamer you and I both know will be

57:40.540 --> 57:42.700
streaming this but I'm sure you're going to stream it as

57:42.700 --> 57:48.380
well. Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. All right. Coming whenever they

57:48.380 --> 57:50.980
finish it, I guess. All right. In the meantime, I'm sure it's

57:50.980 --> 57:54.100
pretty much done. What I want to do those I want to see it

57:54.100 --> 57:57.820
actually be successful. So that they bring out more characters.

57:57.980 --> 57:58.780
Yeah, DLC.

57:59.540 --> 58:05.180
Do you remember when I was into the guy I can't remember what

58:05.180 --> 58:07.140
company it was had the dating sim but I played all the

58:07.140 --> 58:11.980
Homestuck characters. And it was all web based. And they took it

58:11.980 --> 58:14.820
down. I was really mad and I paid for it too. Well, and if it

58:14.820 --> 58:15.940
does, I can't remember the name.

58:16.220 --> 58:19.500
I was just gonna say if it does well, DBD will probably cross

58:19.500 --> 58:22.140
over into other types of games too. I mean, this

58:22.140 --> 58:23.740
Namco Hi, thank you, Dark Tessa.

58:23.820 --> 58:27.180
This is hot on the heels of the Dead by Daylight board game too.

58:27.340 --> 58:31.540
So, you know, which I ordered this. And I think if that does

58:31.540 --> 58:33.540
well, and this does well, I think you're just going to see

58:33.540 --> 58:37.980
DVD as a franchise grow into other places too. Which could be

58:37.980 --> 58:38.620
interesting.

58:38.980 --> 58:41.620
Maybe Loki, would you play the Dead by Daylight board game with

58:41.620 --> 58:47.260
us? Maybe I want to do a live play of the board game when mine

58:47.260 --> 58:47.820
arrives.

58:48.020 --> 58:49.940
I'll try it. Yeah, we could do that. I'll try it.

58:49.940 --> 58:51.620
And I ordered the full set.

58:51.780 --> 58:53.860
Do you think it'll get here before the 20th anniversary?

58:54.220 --> 58:59.300
That would be awesome if it did. I know. polyester did a video

58:59.300 --> 59:02.700
about the orders, but I'd have to check the site to see when

59:02.700 --> 59:06.620
the they're planning on shipping. Okay. All right. I'm

59:06.620 --> 59:07.380
excited about it.

59:07.460 --> 59:09.660
Well, in the meantime, let's move on to a completely

59:09.660 --> 59:11.300
different headline from dark Sakura.

59:12.500 --> 59:16.700
Yeah, so, uh, you know, and this is actually coming in light of

59:16.700 --> 59:21.940
all of this bullshit coming from faux news about, oh, we're gonna

59:21.940 --> 59:25.780
blame, you know, video game violence, blah, blah, blah, blah,

59:25.780 --> 59:31.500
blah, same shit, different year, you know, but there is a study

59:31.900 --> 59:37.340
that's out. This is that children could have a boost to

59:37.340 --> 59:43.020
their intelligence by playing video games. So the study was on

59:43.020 --> 59:47.260
American children between nine and 10 years old who spent more

59:47.260 --> 59:50.140
time playing that when they spent more time playing video

59:50.140 --> 59:53.460
games, they experienced a significant increase in their

59:53.460 --> 59:58.180
intelligence stores. When retested two years later,

59:58.620 --> 01:00:05.500
amounting to an extra 2.5 IQ points above the average. They

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:11.780
said that basically, other forms of screen time were also tested

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.340
such as watching videos, chatting on social media, and

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.460
they had neither a positive nor negative effect on

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:21.300
intelligence. For the record, the the study had zero funding

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:25.220
from anyone in the video game industry. They said that they

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.540
they did not examine the effects of screen behavior on physical

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:32.740
activities, sleep, mental well being or school performance. But

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:37.700
when just testing intelligence, that was the result. And it was

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:42.340
across the board. Um, I'm going to actually read this this quote

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:46.780
on here. And this is actually from Torkel Klingberg, who is a

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.620
professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Karolinska

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:55.300
Institute in Stockholm. Our result, our results support the

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:58.100
claim that screen time generally doesn't impair children's

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.060
cognitive abilities, and that playing video games actually

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:04.300
helps boost intelligence. This is consistent with several

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:08.860
experimental studies of video game playing. So the analysis

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:14.420
was on more than 9000 boys and girls. And it was on a long

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.860
term study. Like I said, there were there were two years that

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:20.820
they were all retested. And when they were nine to 10, they went

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.780
through different psychological tests to gauge their general,

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:27.540
you know, mental capacity, what their level of intelligence was,

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:30.100
you know, they were also asked how much time they spent

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:34.380
watching TV playing video games and on social media. On average,

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.460
they spent about two and a half hours a day watching TV, a half

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.940
hour on social media and one hour playing video games. Two

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.740
years later, 5000 of the children repeated the

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:48.020
psychological tests, and that they showed that kids who played

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:52.100
more than the average hour of video games wound up with higher

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.420
intelligence scores than the kids who spent less time playing

01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:02.540
video games. And what they're thinking is that it provides

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.460
what what they're referring to as enriched environments, and

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.420
requires them to tackle tasks that they would not do every

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:15.180
day. For example, active strategy, planning, quick

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:20.580
executive decision making. The more that someone plays the

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:25.340
games, they build the neural pathways that establish the

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:29.860
their adaptation to those particular skills. And we know

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:35.100
that that's actually how the mind learns a skill is that it

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:38.540
forms a neural pathway that outlines this is how you do it.

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:43.380
I mean, it's where we get muscle memory from, for example, is

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:47.460
because that's formed that that connection with with the body to

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:53.980
just know how to do it. And another quote on here, who is an

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.940
associate professor of psychiatry, Charles R. Drew

01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:02.380
University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles. That's

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:07.380
Dr. Anish Dubey, I think is how it's pronounced. But he says

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.380
that the more someone practices or plays these video games, the

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.460
more they reinforce the neural pathways involved in

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:15.380
accomplishing the objectives of the game. And those same neural

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:18.140
pathways may be involved in other types of real world

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.980
decision making that factor into our measure of intelligence.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:25.740
Video games by design, require focus and attention to the

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.220
content presented and strategizing in the moment.

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:31.020
Whereas it's easy to watch something on television without

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:34.500
paying much attention to the content. If you watch a segment

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:38.260
on television and miss something you do not lose, and you can

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:40.580
still infer the missing parts based on the remaining

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:46.740
narrative. This would be harder to do in video games. So now

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:50.300
they're also talking about now of doing other studies where

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:54.060
they're want to find correlation between video game and mental

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:58.220
health after two years. And if it all if an improvement in

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:03.100
intelligence also correlates to better mental health. I have

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:07.460
learned that the smarter I get, more depressed I get, because I

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:11.740
understand that things are shitty. That that's just an

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:16.500
aside. But I mean, look at look at a lot of us, you know, how

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.260
many of us basically had a controller in our hand when we

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.500
were, you know,

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:25.620
little Yeah, I was gonna I was gonna say like, we all grew up

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.020
with video games. And I think we've heard for many years, you

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:30.780
know, video games are going to rot your brain. Yet most of us

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.300
that grew up on these games, we all turned out pretty

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.500
intelligent, you know, like, you know, and I don't know to what

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.620
extent the games are to thank for that. But they definitely

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.220
didn't rot our brains like we were told they were going to.

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:46.540
I would think it also depends on the genre of game that someone

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.100
typically plays. But definitely puzzle games, especially the

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:56.940
ones that are timed, and things like Pio Pio, or even Tetris,

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.380
you're learning your spatial awareness, along with quick

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:05.020
decision making. And then you have things that are like, like

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.620
people who play the strategy games, that's teaching to look

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:12.020
beyond an immediate circle and look for long term effect. You

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:15.620
know, at least that's what where I'm going with this part of it.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.820
Those are just inferences that I've made.

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:21.140
I think many of us that grew up on video games played a variety

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:23.380
of games, you know, sure, we had our favorites, I'm sure, but we

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.220
played a probably a variety of games. I think it goes back to

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.420
you were talking about that, you know, the tasks are something

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:32.340
that these kids are doing, and that their brain is kind of

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.740
constantly moving, because the games are giving them these

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:37.300
different tasks. And probably, again, depending on the type of

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.420
game you're playing, it's in cases, yeah, is what sort of

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:44.300
tasks it is. Whereas I would bet the control group that didn't

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:48.700
play the games, probably was watching television, and just

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:51.940
absorbing whatever was being put at them. And there was no task

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.900
to complete, you're just absorbing someone else's story.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:56.460
Now, if you want to argue difference between ambient and

01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:59.700
active, well, now, if you want to argue that maybe kids were

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:03.820
going out and playing sports instead, or something like that,

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.740
then that's all fine and good. And that's probably really good

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.540
for someone's physical health. But you know, a good a good

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:12.260
coordination, sure, reflex time, but it's there's not a variety

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.460
of tasks the way there are in games. And you know that between

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:19.380
the strategy game and the the that would exercise your brain,

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.220
you're certainly getting the physical activity, but not the

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:26.100
I think, while there is a cognitive element that's

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:30.020
involved in playing a game, usually it's not the player

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:35.860
that's having to make the plan. It's the coach or whoever who's

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:40.300
looking over the thing, making the plan, and sending out the

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.340
players to do that. Now the player has to execute whatever

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.100
task that they're doing. And yes, there's going to be, you

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:50.820
know, like, I'll just use like, baseball, there's aiming,

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.780
there's spatial awareness, there's force, there's knowing

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.620
how to a little bit of physics involved in it, in it with

01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:01.380
hitting directions and whatnot. But in the end, they have a

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.980
particular task that they're executing, and they're limited

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:06.500
within that task that they're executing. Same with football,

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:10.420
if you're given a play, you know that your job is to cover this

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:14.660
person's ass while they run with a ball, or your job is to take

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.900
said ball and run like hell and make sure that no one pounds

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:18.700
your head into the dirt.

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:22.060
I would think even with an individualized sport like

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.140
tennis, it's still, you know, you still have a tennis coach,

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:27.660
but who's teaching you how to play it, but you're kind of

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.620
going through the same motion, right? You're going through the

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.660
same motions, pretty much. And again,

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.180
Your end goal is the same every single time that you do it.

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:37.740
And I'm not knocking physical sports for kids. That's fine. As

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:39.500
long as you know, it's a positive environment and

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.020
everything, because we've all seen some scary shit at Little

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:44.900
League games. But as long as it's a positive and supportive

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.260
environment, I'm all for it. Because you know, I think a good

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:49.820
mix is probably the best, but I'm just kind of illustrating.

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:53.420
It doesn't have the same level of cognitive stimulation.

01:07:53.540 --> 01:08:00.260
The mental. Yeah, so it's just interesting. So I'm glad science

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.740
is out there to prove. I'm sure that won't matter to a lot of

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.260
people, but it's nice to still have some of the science and

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.580
studies behind it for sure.

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:09.060
It absolutely is. I'm going to send it to my mom and tell her

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.060
this is why I'm smart.

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.780
There. There you go. And I think that's what most people will be

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:14.940
doing with this article this week. Those of us like us who

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:15.860
grew up on games and

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:16.740
Hey, Mom, look,

01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.780
we're told they were gonna rot our brain, or that I told violent

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:23.100
video games, we're gonna, you know, unwind us or whatever it

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:23.940
was. So

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:28.820
now I'm, I think that one other thing that that I would like to

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.940
see, and it's too late to do it now. Because I mean, of course,

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:35.660
those times are long past. But I would be interested to see how

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:40.500
earlier types of gaming, like, you know, growing up a pinball.

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:45.340
I, I don't think that and now keep in mind, I love pinball. I

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:49.220
love to play pinball. I think that you still have some of that

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:54.460
still same limited strategy that you wouldn't have in say, going

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.340
through a game where you're solving multiple puzzles and

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:01.860
working through a narrative. Yeah. And I hate to say it,

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:04.220
because I mean, there's there's some new pinball tables out

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:07.020
there that have a lot of good challenges and everything. But

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.780
in the end, it's flipper plus ball, you know, meets target.

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:16.020
All right. Well, let's move on to a game that has a lot of

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.580
people thinking right, Loki.

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:25.180
Yeah. So, you know, I think we've always been wondering if

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.300
there's gonna be a sequel for Death Stranding coming. And I

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.980
kind of figured that if there was going to be a sequel coming

01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:35.340
for that, then I mean, we're gonna find out about it with

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:40.820
some sort of event starring Jeff Keighley. You know, I mean, we

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.940
have one right around the corner. So it only makes sense

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.860
if there was going to be an announcement that that might be

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:51.580
coming. But apparently, it's been sort of acknowledged by

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:59.020
Norman Reedus. Basically saying that, um, yeah, I don't know if

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:04.180
he's, you know, he's necessarily confirmed it, but

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:08.060
there's a lot of like, weird, like, tweets and stuff going

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:12.380
around, like, Hideo Kojima has got playing looks like action

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:15.460
figures and stuff like that. And then of course, you know, he

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:18.100
said, you know, quick, okay, so you've got a book going on,

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.220
you've got final season coming out, and then a spin off, and

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:27.260
you're filming Death Stranding, the video game. I'm saying, you

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:29.940
know, we just started the second one. And this was, I

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:33.900
believe, in an interview that he was talking about for the

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.420
upcoming book, The Ravaged. So he was talking about like the

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.340
stuff that he's working on right now. So

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.500
so he slipped. I mean, a lot of a lot of these pre work has to

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.780
be done in advance. He slipped. They're not going to sue Norman

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:49.300
Reedus over a broken NDA. They're not going to do it like

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.780
he probably didn't mean to spoil it. But he probably Norman

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.140
Reedus probably doesn't follow the industry because he's he's

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.140
an actor trying to do movies and that type of stuff. He

01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.180
probably doesn't follow the industry close enough to know

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.260
there's a very specific timetable when you announce

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.900
things that it does. So he slipped up, you made a mistake,

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:06.780
whatever, like, it's just it. And nothing will happen to him

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.620
as a result. And you know, ultimately, now it's just okay,

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.660
well, that secrets out. But I would

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:17.380
I love the response. So once this news kind of came out,

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:23.020
Hideo Kojima posts, go to your private room, my friend. He has

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:27.620
like a bat, a picture of the bat with barbed wire. Yeah, yeah.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:28.180
Yeah.

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:34.820
So Kojima basically confirming it. But what's weird about I'm

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:37.180
not shocked that there's a sequel to Death Stranding. I'm

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:41.220
not shocked about that. But a lot of talk with Kojima lately

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:44.140
has been what is he working on now? Isn't he working on a

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.580
scary game? Isn't there something kind of new that he's

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:50.700
doing? And you know, the IP silent hell that won't go away.

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:54.940
It would be weird if like all this time, it just turns out,

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:57.500
oh, he's working on a Death Stranding sequel. I'm not saying

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.540
that's bad, because Death Stranding was an interesting

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:03.020
game. And it came out at a really good time for that sort

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.300
of story. But it just it's just it would just be a weird

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:08.620
conclusion to all this Kojima mystery of the last few years.

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:13.780
It would be a little unusual. But also, you mean, what do we

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.860
do nowadays in the game industry? We we make sequels.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:20.420
True. So well, and that's not to say Kojima can't work on two

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.620
things at once. And especially when we're talking about

01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:27.260
designing for what is now current gen systems. I'm sure

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.300
they have to get all the motion capture of Norman Reedus locked

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:34.900
in way sooner rather than later to get him rendered. And in the

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:37.860
game, you know, if he's the primary character, again, they

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.860
got to get all that work done. I mean, this game could still be

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:44.660
years out. And he's involved now. Absolutely. There's no

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.740
reason why that can't be the case. So it's not to say Kojima

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:51.100
can't work on two games at once. It's just, I don't think

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.580
this was the one they plan to announce at Keeley's next event.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:13:01.140
So probably not. Yeah. Let's see Questbuster in chat says on the

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:04.780
other hand, Reedus might be playing Kojima's long PR game

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:09.020
like a damn fiddle. Maybe suggesting that there was a

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.780
little bit of malice, maybe playful malice. I don't think

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:15.220
yeah, Reedus is in the interest of actually hurting Kojima.

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:19.780
He's still not dressing up in full was it full body cast

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:21.180
makeup again.

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:26.100
But you know, I could see that maybe he trolls Kojima by

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:27.980
announcing it early because like, what's gonna happen? What

01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:31.140
are you gonna do? So what people know about the game early? So

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:35.340
what when you get do stab me? Yeah, big game get sequel. Tell

01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.900
me something I don't know. But I think for a lot of us that you

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:41.540
know, follow the releases about. It's just I think I guess I can

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:44.260
really only speak for myself. I'm surprised that Death

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:48.220
Stranding sequel would be next potentially. I just thought

01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:51.660
there was something else happening. But there's it's it's

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:55.580
also very possible something else got canceled. It's happened

01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:03.380
before. So who knows? All right, moving on. Let's talk about what

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:07.420
I think is very interesting with this whole PlayStation. You

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:11.460
know, the PlayStation Plus is getting redone. And we actually

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.460
know what some of the PlayStation Plus releases are

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.660
going to be we know what some of the classics are that when

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:19.500
the service rolls out in on June 13. For the Americas. I think

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.940
it's even sooner for Japan. I think Japan gets it this

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:26.180
weekend. So we know some of the classics. So we know that for

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:30.140
example, PlayStation one and PlayStation portable. These are

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:33.500
the classics you will get if you subscribe to that highest tier.

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:40.260
ape escape, hotshots golf, IQ intelligent cube, jumping flash,

01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:44.700
siphon filter, super stardust portable, Mr. driller tech and

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:51.340
two worms world party worms are Armageddon. And that's it 10

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:57.340
games. Now, I'm not saying that list is bad by any means. But I

01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:00.820
know when I heard this news, I was like, wait a damn minute.

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:04.220
Didn't they say in their press release, they were going to have

01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:10.140
up to 350 classic games that were playable. Now, sure, I see

01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:12.980
that there are PlayStation two games and PlayStation three

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:19.300
games. Sure, you add it all up, it's maybe 50. It's not 350. So

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:22.860
I guess maybe it's a long game. And many people on Twitter when

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:25.300
I made a sassy tweet about this many people on Twitter were

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:29.500
quick to correct me and say, this is a first look list. This

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:33.500
is a preliminary list. This is not the finalized list. Okay,

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.020
counterpoint. This is out next week in Japan. The time for

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:44.220
first look is past. This is now the time for a deep look, an

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:47.340
intimate look a further look, because this is what they're

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:52.380
trying to get people to buy. And if it's 10 games, that's not my

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.540
first now here's where I'm going to start to kind of scale back

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.820
my reaction. Because when I heard this list on Monday, I was

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:04.540
like, that is sad. That's sadder than what Nintendo launched

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.460
their switch online with and you see how much shit they get for

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:13.420
that, right? That is the 10 for the PS one. That's sad. But then

01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:18.340
a second part of this came out where I'm like, Oh, this is why

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:23.380
it's only 10. And that is that the PS classic games are going

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:27.620
to now have trophies. Remember, they didn't have trophies near

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:33.820
the PlayStation one. But a tweet where Ben studio shared a clip

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:39.140
of siphon filter showed a new trophy and explosive start

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:44.620
available in the PlayStation one classic. And Ben studio actually,

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.260
the design manager there, Eric Jensen said in a tweet

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.460
responding to a fan, he helped out with a few of the trophies,

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.980
mostly naming. And there's apparently a platinum trophy

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:57.540
called excellent work agent, which assumably would be what

01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.900
you get when you unlock all of the other trophies. Ah, so this

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:05.660
explains now it's just trophies. And you know, some people may

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.540
feel stronger about trophies than others. But now I

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:11.300
understand why it's taken so long for them to because now

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:14.460
they're actually having they're not just slapping an emulator on

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:18.100
it and putting it out on the service Nintendo. But they're

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:21.820
actually going back and trying to add more flags for trophies

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.900
and maybe other stuff too. We'll see when it comes out. Maybe some

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:28.100
types of filtering. I don't know. But I'm not really

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:32.460
counting on any of that. I still think it was wrong of them to

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:37.860
promote 350 games. Even if that is their plan to get there in

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:41.220
three years. That's not where they're at this week when it

01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:47.100
launches in Japan. So I don't know. We'll see. I don't know

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:50.700
when you hear about all this. The 10 games and all this stuff.

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:53.500
I'm looking at chat now. Finally, Bobby Blackwell says up

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.580
to 350 games. Yeah. Okay. I think we all know the use of up

01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:02.860
to was a little little bit of a stretch here. Just a tad. Just a

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:06.660
tad. Um, Mike Deaf says trophies for PlayStation One games is

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:12.460
pretty cool. Yeah, it is pretty cool. Let's see. And Mike Deaf

01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:15.100
says we're also not paying around $80 a year for the

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:18.300
PlayStation Plus service. And not to mention that even Nintendo

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:23.020
was criticized for having so little games in the service. I

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:26.020
thought you were paying $80 for the highest level PlayStation

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.020
Plus. Isn't it something like 120 a year or something like

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:32.980
that? So I don't know. Anyway, I could be wrong. I don't have all

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.740
that. The PlayStation Plus, unfortunately, it's a little

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:37.900
complicated. And I don't have the chart in front of me right

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.700
now that shows how much every level costs. But I'm not I'm not

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:44.020
sure these 10 games are worth it to me to get the highest level

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:47.460
of PlayStation Plus. I was already a little bit like a but

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:50.740
now after seeing this list, I'm like, Nah, I don't want it. I

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:51.260
don't need it.

01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.660
It's just our stupid PlayStation Now stuff. I just don't I'm not

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:56.900
interested in that stuff.

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:03.740
Yeah. Dark Sakura trophies. Do they matter? Is it incentive? Or

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:08.340
nah? No. No. And I think that just depends on the gamer. Some

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.100
people love the trophy chase the trophy hunt. I would love to see

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:15.220
something like trophies in the Nintendo collection. Not that I

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.460
would necessarily want to chase them all. But I think it would

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:20.700
be fun to have like your little digital certificate, your

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:24.340
digital badge, your little proof that yes, I beat Metroid without

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:26.780
using codes or whatever. Kid Icarus will be even bigger one.

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.460
I beat Kid Icarus without using codes or whatever it is. I think

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:34.660
that would be fun. But I also don't count on Nintendo to get

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:37.740
by that there was another Reggie interview that came out where

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:40.100
somebody asked him why did Nintendo take so damn long to

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:43.180
come to the table with online? And it's the answer most of us

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:47.380
had assumed for many years. Japan didn't understand that

01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:50.620
that that it was more of a need in the US and Europe is basically

01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:54.580
extremely paraphrasing what Reggie said. You can go look at

01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:57.500
that up for yourself if you want. But yeah, just on a

01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:01.220
related note, continue to drag their feet on that, I guess.

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:06.380
Mike Deft says, Yeah, I think it's over 100. But it's

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:09.300
different in Mexico and Latin America or Mike Deft is that

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.660
than it is for the US because they don't have PlayStation now

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:14.980
there. And that is true is that, you know, a lot of countries,

01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:18.180
notably Australia, aren't going to have the same type of

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.420
PlayStation Plus because they can't do the cloud streaming.

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:23.460
For whatever reason, it's just not built to support that the

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:26.140
infrastructure of Sony in those countries or whatever.

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:27.820
Interesting.

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:33.700
All right. Meanwhile, there's a very interesting headline that's

01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.420
getting a lot of attention Dark Sakura.

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:42.300
Well, um, we actually brought this up kind of last week, I

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:48.100
think talking about Xbox and how they're selling in Japan. And it

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:51.220
turns out that for the first time in eight years, the Xbox

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:56.620
has outsold PlayStation in Japan this past week. The Xbox Series

01:20:56.660 --> 01:21:08.140
S alone outsold the PS5 and PS5 digital edition by about 3,

01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:16.940
3,800 units. So however, I mean, it's it's a rare occurrence. And

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.860
I think that some of this has to do with system availability and

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:27.100
whatnot. So one other thing also to keep in mind, too, is that it

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:31.140
hadn't had the best support by Microsoft in in Japan before, but

01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:38.020
now they're having a lot more successful series of sales with

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:45.740
this particular system. Simply because of the rollout of Game

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:52.900
Pass for both console and PC in Japan in April 2020. So they've

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:57.180
seen a lot more player activity than any other time in Xbox

01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:01.940
history in Japan. And that they're also thinking that the

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:06.700
acquisition of Tango Gameworks is going to be a very big step

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:11.660
toward achieving a better market share in Japan. Phil Spencer is

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:15.980
actually saying that they intend to take better care of Japanese

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:22.820
players and and really make sure that they have, you know, they

01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:25.820
have a place in that aspect of the gaming industry that their

01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:28.020
their needs are being catered to that games are coming out that

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:33.660
they'd want to play. I think it's I think it's good. I mean,

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:39.620
yeah, it could be due to availability, but it is what it

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:41.140
is. It's actually worth mentioning.

01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:44.420
Yeah, no, for sure. You know, and last week there. Yeah,

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:49.660
right. This topic came up last week. There was no fact behind

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.940
it to back it up until what we have here tonight. But we had a

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:55.380
caller on the show last week who said, you know, I was saying

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:57.980
the Xbox is a non factor in Japan. And that's just the way

01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:00.100
it is. And somebody said, No, it's wrong. It's selling. Yeah,

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:04.220
I was wrong. I commit that I whoops. And this this headline

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:07.340
sure, sure made a humble person out of me. It is what it is.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:12.660
Now, I, again, I think this just makes a nice headline because,

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:15.820
yes, and I agree with Zen monkey 11. And Chad is saying, that's

01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.660
because people can't find PlayStation fives. It's not like

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:23.260
they sold, I think a better, a more impactful headline, I guess

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:27.540
would have been if the Xbox sold a lot of units, you know, out

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:29.540
of but they didn't, they still didn't sell all things

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:33.980
considered that many units, but I didn't think they were hardly

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:37.100
selling any. And apparently, Microsoft is starting to catch

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:39.940
on in Japan a little more again. And now you kind of

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.380
brought up game pass. I know undertale recently got

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.260
localized to Japanese audiences, I think. So I think there's just

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:49.580
a lot of stuff now that probably game passes leveraging. And I

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:54.820
think that it's interesting that it's the Xbox s, and not the x.

01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:59.780
So it's, it's probably that lower price for the s, combined

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:03.020
with the fact that it's a game pass system. And it's it's

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.780
turning some heads in Japan. I still don't think it's, you

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:09.460
know, I think we put the lifetime sales next to Sony and

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:13.500
Nintendo, it's still not where you know, a competitive system

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:17.540
ought to be. But this headline certainly shows that there's

01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:21.420
potential there for Microsoft to grow. And maybe all is not lost,

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:25.620
I would say with Microsoft in Japan, as I had assumed last

01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:30.480
week. So props to Phil Spencer on that victory and that

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:34.700
headline, even if maybe a chip shortage was to thank for it. In

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:37.540
part still, I think the fact that they sold as many as they

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:42.100
did is still a long way from where they were even what 510

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:47.100
years ago. All right. Well, moving on, Loki.

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:53.960
Yep. So speaking about Xbox, there's this cool new patent

01:24:53.980 --> 01:25:00.020
that is coming out, talking about how I don't know if this

01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:03.860
necessarily goes back to when they announced the Xbox one and

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:05.700
that type of stuff. But remember, that was supposed to

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:08.700
be almost like a digital only console at one time, but now

01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:10.780
they have a way that they're saying they're going to be able

01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:17.820
to validate your physical media to unlock digital copies of the

01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:21.220
game. So if I have like a physical version of, you know,

01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:25.160
Grand Theft Auto four, something like that, then somehow, it'll

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:29.500
be able to scan that disk and authenticate a digital copy of

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:33.460
the game for me since you know, they may in the future not be

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:36.980
able to play those games on the drives that they have, like the

01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:39.180
Blu-ray drives might not be able to handle it or something like

01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:43.220
that. So I'm not necessarily sure how it's going to work. But

01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.460
sounds interesting.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.540
I can tell you it's gonna work. Jason outlined it a little bit

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:51.680
in the intro. Well, we don't know for sure. But I'm, I would

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.100
guess absolutely, they're going to leverage Windows 11. They're

01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:57.260
going to leverage Windows 11. And what they're going to do is

01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:59.200
they're going to build something into that that will decrypt the

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.380
Xbox disks the same way the system does. And it'll know Yep,

01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:05.140
this is a valid copy of this disk. And while you're signed

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:07.900
into this account here on your PC, and the disk is in the

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.300
drive, we know you have the game and now it's available on your

01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:14.380
Xbox in your account. That's, that's, I would bet that's what

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.540
they're going to do is they're going to leverage, you know, the

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:19.100
market share of Windows 11 to make that happen.

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:23.920
Hope it's not I hope I don't need a disk drive in my computer

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.020
to be able to

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:28.620
true because we're starting to see less and less of those are

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:34.180
as most nobody has, you know, optical drives anymore. I still

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:34.820
have one.

01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:41.460
You would be surprised. Trust me. I hear about it all the

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:44.060
time. There's trust me, there's annoying

01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:48.420
still a lot of people that kind of rely on it for I have these

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:53.180
old photo CDs, or I have drivers that you know, what if I don't

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:55.620
have internet and I need something, you know, like, the

01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.300
drive now is just for backup purposes, even though Yeah, I

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:01.980
guess a USB drive can also be, you know, a big thing. But you

01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:07.900
can also get a drive, you can get a DVD drive, that is USB, or

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:09.940
Blu ray drive that is USB if you really wanted it.

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:14.380
So but without outing where I work,

01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:20.180
I get plenty of I need to burn this Blu ray disc, I need to

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:24.520
burn this DVD, and it needs to be a video disc. And there are a

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:29.040
lot of people who are still using it as an active media

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:29.800
trade source.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:34.760
A lot of folks in chat are kind of lighting up about like Bobby

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:37.600
Blackwell says you can't get a gaming PC case with a drive bay

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:41.640
anymore. DJRMS says I want to buy a new PC case, but so many

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.240
new and fancy ones do not have spots for optical drives. Well,

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.560
I guess I'm giving away how old my computer is. I am looking to

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.480
replace it. It's a few years old at this point. But yeah, and not

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.680
that an optical drive is something I'm looking for. But

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.400
this is a very interesting patent that might change that

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.800
conversation a little bit where I'm like, Oh, maybe I want an

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.200
external USB drive. I mean, we'll see. And then someone else

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:04.040
in chat, I think as Joe and under Matt said, not gonna lie, I

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:08.200
wish Sony had this patent. It's not to say Sony couldn't do it.

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:10.980
They'd have to pay Microsoft to do it at this point, but they

01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:15.760
could do it. And you might kind of laugh at that prospect. But

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:19.760
how does Microsoft have the Blu ray player? Because guess who

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:23.080
has a stake in Blu ray right now. So Microsoft has to pay

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.440
Sony to have a Blu ray player on their device. There could be an

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.400
interesting exchange there. Hmm.

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:32.400
But bear in mind, though, a patent does not reflect reality.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.860
That is true, too. There's patents for things all the time

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.000
that never end up happening. And yeah, lots of that stuff, or

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.600
they change significantly and so forth. Absolutely. But it is

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:48.120
I'll give you an example. Sega VR. Mm hmm. They had working

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:52.440
units never came out. Well, partly because they were causing

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:56.040
migraines because the sync between player movement and

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.720
backgrounds would disconnect and gave people seizures. But that's

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:01.240
another story.

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.880
Pod culture and chat says yeah, Microsoft back to the wrong

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:09.560
format in that war. I they didn't have a choice. You know,

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:13.320
again, Sony had a stake in Blu ray. So they weren't going to

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.520
especially you know, when it was about being that definitive

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:19.080
living room device, they were not going to use their pay their

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:22.820
competitor to they were going to leverage HD DVD. The mistake

01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:26.960
Microsoft made was not having HDVD players in every single

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.600
Xbox that was that it was a separate accessory. That was the

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.600
problem because that's how PlayStation made DVDs as

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.400
impactful as they were is that they were on every PlayStation

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:39.160
two they sold was also a DVD player. And you got to think way

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:43.520
back that's how DVDs became the thing was the PS two. And then

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:49.080
how to Blu rays win that war PlayStation three. So it's Yep, I

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.380
think my I just say, you know, yeah, yeah, Microsoft did back

01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:55.680
the wrong format. I would just say they didn't have a choice. I

01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:00.800
think it's just the poorly timed implementation that didn't work.

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.960
And you know, and by the time it was about the Xbox one, while it

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:08.080
was done, the victor had been decided porn went to Blu ray and

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:14.940
it was over. So interesting, Bobby Blackwell says one of the

01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:18.720
reasons they backed HD DVD was because they wanted both to

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:22.040
lose. So streaming and digital would win. Ah, that's also

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:28.920
clever to split the market. Perhaps. All right, let's move

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:33.200
on. Let's talk about a game I've played a little bit here in a

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:38.600
little bit thereof. It's Pokemon go and Pokemon go who boy. You

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:41.320
know, I feel like every other month on the show, we're talking

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:44.480
about Niantic made a change and their player base doesn't like

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.520
it. Well, guess what? They did it again. They made another

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.840
change and the player base doesn't like it. And it has to

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:55.920
do with scaling back the remote raid passes. So they were giving

01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:58.960
away remote raid Pat. Well, they weren't giving them away. But it

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.920
was they were giving away because they were doing these

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:05.960
one pokey coin bundles every week was giving you a remote

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.720
raid pass. I don't know when they started that. But it wasn't

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:11.400
more than a year ago. This wasn't something they started at

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:14.740
the beginning of the pandemic. But they started doing it about

01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:17.800
a year ago, I would say is when they started giving away those

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.760
remote raid passes. And they said they were going to do it

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.960
every week in the in the bundles. Well, they're going to

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:26.160
stop. They're not going to give you remote raid passes for free

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.280
and bundles and or you know what I mean for one coin, which is

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:37.840
practically free. So that's gone. And as they did that, they

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:42.440
have upped the cost of the remote raid passes in a bundle

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:46.280
anyway, most people were by a one remote raid pass will cost

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:50.880
you 100 coins. Three used to cost you 250. But you got that

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.920
discount, right? Guess what three now cost you 300. So there

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:59.200
is no point to buying those raid passes in bulk. And that was a

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.900
change. They just made it. It's already live in the game. It's a

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:07.360
done deal. And yes, you can earn coins for free in the game. If

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:13.040
you do the gym meta, but you can only earn 50 coins a day. So you

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.840
don't you can't remote raid every day. You can only remote

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:20.680
raid twice a week, basically. So or, you know, once every other

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:24.480
day, I don't know anyway, what they're also trying to do. And

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:27.720
basically, why is it that they're doing this? Because

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:31.440
America has decided COVID is over and they're just following

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:35.920
suit. Notice how I phrase I didn't say COVID is over I said

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:41.720
America decided COVID is over. There's a big difference. Niantic

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:47.040
is also trying to push people to raid in person again, by getting

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:51.400
the rewards for in person rating to be sweeter. So you get more

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:56.440
not just rare candy when you do those raids, but you get rare XL

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.800
candies, which are very hard to come by. I don't think anybody's

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:03.640
upset with that change. Plus, you know, it Pokemon go rating,

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:07.000
either everybody's sitting in their own car and doing it that

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.860
way. Or at least it's outdoors. And you don't have to really be

01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:12.120
close to people to do it. You know, I've done plenty of my

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.480
remote or excuse me, plenty of my own Pokemon raid in the day.

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:18.400
And I would see even in the era of COVID. It's a pretty safe

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:22.320
thing to do compared to most things. However, I just think

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.520
what kind of sucks here. And I think what a lot of you know,

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:29.000
the players don't like is that it's not that they're just

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:32.120
adding something. It's that they're also taking something

01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:35.400
away with no warning. I think if they have just added the

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:38.240
incentives to get out there and do it in person, then they would

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:40.160
motivate more people to go out there and do it in person,

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:44.320
especially the XL candy, but to take away with these remote

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:47.240
raids. And I think it's just a matter of time before they flip

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:50.480
that switch if they didn't already. But remote raids are

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.960
supposed to be weaker. You're not supposed to be able to do

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.920
as much damage in remote raids. So even though today you might

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.600
be able to take out what a tapu fini I think is the latest

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.840
legendary that's in the game. You can take that out with four

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.760
people in a remote raid. You're not supposed to be able to do

01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.560
that. It's supposed to be weaker. And I imagine it's just

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.760
a matter of time before they flip that switch too. So yeah,

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.880
and Mike Defton chat says yeah, Niantic lack of communication

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:15.840
toward the player base is what hurts the game more than

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.000
anything. And this is the part where we sit here going. They

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.920
just supposedly learn their lesson. Like not even three

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:28.200
months ago, when we had this whole discussion about changing

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:32.120
the radius of the pokey stop, and they they tried to shrink it

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:35.440
back to 40, which would match what Pikmin and Ingress have.

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.880
But again, because you're taking something away that you put in

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.680
there and you I think they had kind of said would always be

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:45.720
there. The player base lost their fucking mind and held

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:49.520
their feet to the fire over it. And they had to reverse course

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.920
and say, we'll listen in the future. We'll listen. Well, this

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.680
just shows they're not listening. And that's what's

01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:01.360
incredibly frustrating for some people. Now, I don't know how

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.640
many people are going to go to the great lengths that are

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.520
necessary to really make your point and delete the fucking

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:11.520
game. If it's that. And I will say our own Pokemon nerd resident

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.200
nerd Shane who's come on the show several times. He's told me

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.600
he's deleted the game from his phone and he's done with it.

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:22.880
Like between this, the reduced incense spawns living in a rural

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:26.000
area. He's just like, Pokemon go just isn't for me. And he

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:31.200
deleted it off his phone. So I mean, it'll take a lot of people

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:34.520
to do that. I think for Niantic to really shape shift their

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:41.240
shift course and do that whole thing. So but in the meantime,

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:45.880
let's see what are some other comments here? Oh, there are new

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:47.920
social features that are supposed to be coming to the

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:52.840
game in the next few months. Oh, yeah. I got an invite to a

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:57.000
Niantic social app. So it's interesting because the whole

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.680
social stuff is already built into ingress. But I guess

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.120
because I'm an ingress player, maybe they even know I'm a

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:06.160
heavy user. I don't know. I got invited through because you

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:09.680
know, it's not it's not quote unquote, easy to beta stuff on

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.480
an apple compared to Android because on Android, they just

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:15.440
kind of put it up as a beta but an apple you have to be invited

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.600
by the publisher to something called test flight in order to

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.920
be able to attest and that's what I got through Niantic is a

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:26.120
test flight version of the Niantic social app. Now, they

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:29.760
didn't make me sign anything. So I tweeted about it. I was like,

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.680
here's what it looks like. But and then they added a splash

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.480
screen to the game that says reminder, this is confidential.

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:40.000
And you're not just put anything out there on apps. And

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.760
I'm like, Okay, look, if you want to know what the Niantic

01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:47.760
social is, download ingress because it is completely in the

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:56.160
ingress game already, completely in the game already. So it's I

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:59.080
don't know what they're keeping so secret about this app. I also

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.120
don't know why they're building a separate app for it, and not

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:06.760
just putting it into Pokemon go. But somebody I was talking to

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:12.720
had a really good take on why is that maybe the Pokemon company

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:15.760
won't allow it. That you know, there's only because you know,

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.920
the Pokemon company kind of has to own a lot of the stuff that

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:21.320
goes the Pokemon go. And maybe they're not allowing Niantic to

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.640
put their social app in there. So they have to kind of do their

01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:26.360
own thing. I'm going to try to I'm trying to show you without

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:29.760
like giving away where I live. Okay, I zoomed way in so you

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:33.120
can't really let me turn the map a little bit. Okay, I zoomed

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.880
way in here. So all you have to I'll show you the bottom half

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:39.400
the screen, all you have to do if you hit the little button in

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.160
ingress, and you go to the social, which is right in the

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.600
middle. And keep in mind, I'm not breaking any rules. I'm not

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:54.200
showing their app or anything I'm showing. There is oops, I

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.760
got to make sure I'm not zoomed in too far on the dot. I don't

01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.320
care if it shows the neighborhood that I don't want

01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.640
it to show exact house. There's the Niantic social app. It's

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.360
built in ingress. So if you want to know what's coming, just

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:10.200
download ingress. It's right there in the game. So um, and

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:12.560
why is Niantic doing that? Probably because they're seeing

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:16.120
how much of their community is going to discord and slack and

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.960
telegram and group me and all of those apps. And they're like,

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:23.280
Hey, we want to have a little piece of that. So there it is.

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:27.160
Mike Defton chat says this is actually really good for stuff

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:32.600
like that. The group I was in for ingress used to use Google

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.720
Hangouts back in the day. Yeah, back in the day until they

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:37.680
retired that but yeah, oh yeah, I used to love Google Hangouts

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.280
for that stuff. Mike Defton chat says the social app looks like a

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.280
discord server and it looks so bad pretty much it looks like

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:49.120
just a pretty cheap knockoff of discord. So I don't I don't know

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:52.880
like what special thing is going to really draw people to the

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.040
app, but we'll see. So anyway, Mike Defton says they use

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:01.000
Facebook Messenger where they're at. Interesting. All right,

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.600
anyway. That's what they're doing in Pokemon Go. Will they

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:08.520
reverse the remote raid price change? Probably not if people

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.960
don't stop buying them. So if you if you are pissed off about

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:17.080
these changes, you have to stop buying remote raid passes.

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.280
That's the only way this is going to change. Tapu Fini can

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:24.040
even be shiny anyway. I don't know why people will people

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:27.880
aren't rating him. I've gotten to raid him once with a remote

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.600
raid pass. And this this is the part that pisses me off. Then he

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.240
ran away. That's the part that I like I connected with every

01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:38.680
single ball and the fucker still ran away. That's what that's the

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:42.520
enraging part. I don't you know if it's 100 coins to do it,

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:47.440
whatever. But I literally got nothing for doing it. Except some

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.560
stardust and thanks for playing. Silly

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:51.960
and frustration. Don't forget that part.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.600
Yes, I got frustration. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:58.560
Speaking of frustration, let's talk about some old school video

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:00.880
games because I you know what a lot of those were really

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:01.560
frustrating.

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:16.400
Now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.840
into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:22.960
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:28.600
And this is a very unique kind of pick for tonight, isn't it?

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:33.800
It is. So and I do hope that you skip around a little bit in the

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.840
video. Sure. I meant to do an edited version. That's okay. I'll

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:41.240
skip that a little bit. But I picked a Bobo's Big Adventure,

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:47.440
which was a freeware parody flash game. It came out January

01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:52.120
11th, 2012 to play on any browser that would support

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:57.480
flash. So the whole the basically the point is, is that

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:06.160
you are a Bobo and you're trying to rescue your son. What was his

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:10.960
name? Like a boy boy, I think was his name. That's cute. Yeah.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.080
But at any rate, you have to go through like different video

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:20.440
games with like different characters mixed around. And so

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:25.160
each of the sub games have different names. You have Double

01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:31.760
Drabobo, Super Mabobo, Urban Chabobo, Zelda Bobo, Balloona

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:37.960
Bobo, Pro Rabobo, Mega Mabobo, and Contra Bobo and Puncha

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:42.440
Bobo. So you have to use your directional keys to do your

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:48.400
movement, you know, A and S are different actions. So like, like

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:52.400
for example, the first one you're going through, and you

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:55.560
know, beating people up, there's a Goomba that shows up, you know.

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:03.000
All of the levels are a single level except for Contra Bobo. I

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.800
mean, because Contra is like that. But yeah, you have to

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:11.200
rescue a Bobo. That's his name, a Bobo, who gets, you know,

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.080
beaten up in like the beginning of Double Dragon. And then you

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:20.720
go through the different places until you end with Puncha Bobo

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:26.640
where you run into Doc from Punch Out. And big spoiler,

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:30.600
Little Mac is the bad guy. And then you have to decapitate him

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:39.440
with a Power Glove. But it was all a dream. So it references so

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:44.040
many different games in there. It's pretty funny. But the game

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:49.240
actually started development in 2002 by the founder of iMakari,

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.560
Roger Barr, who wanted to make it his first full length Flash

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:56.360
game, and you know, show his favorite NES character a Bobo.

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.320
He worked with a programmer named Bain and they did some

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:04.600
early levels. It was delayed though for a while, especially

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:07.720
when a game that was very similar called Domo-kun's Angry Smash

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:16.520
Fest came out. But with the help of Nick Pasto of Pestoforce and

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:24.680
Pox of the Pox Box, they started over in 2006 and just went going

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:27.440
and tried to keep it along with, you know, standard NES

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:32.600
programming styles. And so they they mixed up the characters and

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:35.960
they did all kinds of different stuff. And then they had the

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.000
Flash version working and they revealed the first three levels

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.920
in 2009 at San Diego Comic Con with a NES controller, the way it

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:51.440
was intended. They had a cabinet, everything there. And then in

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:55.560
2010, they had a free to play cabinet with a sort with a NES

01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:01.920
homage joystick area with artwork done by Jeff Bandelin of

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:07.960
Newgrounds. And then it got delayed again in 2011. And then

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:14.120
finally, a bar took the game with him on a comedy tour that he

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:18.440
was invited to go with. And then the trailer came out. And then

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.920
after a bunch of and basically the trailer was a response to

01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:27.920
donations that they got. And then they started working on a

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:31.640
smaller game called a Bobo Small Adventure for anyone who donated.

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.800
And then on January 11, 2012, it was released on Newgrounds. And

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.800
it had a tutorial how to play it with a with a NES controller.

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:44.960
There's a downloadable version of the game. And they want to

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.520
actually keep having the cabinet out there. The game was pretty

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:52.200
well received. It went Newgrounds 2012 game of the year

01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:55.960
game spy gave them some kudos. They called it the mother of all

01:44:55.960 --> 01:45:03.400
8-bitch 8-bitch 8-bit. I try to say homage. The mother of all

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:10.160
8-bit homage flash video games. GameZone called it part parody

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:15.160
and part tribute. They said that it's the story isn't cheesy, but

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:20.440
is all kinds of badass. That is a quote. Wired said it was an 8-bit

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:24.480
parody done right. So all along the board and the thing the

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:29.480
biggest compliment is that Kishimoto Yoshihisa, who is the

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:33.760
creator of Double Dragon, said in a Polygon interview that he

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:38.480
was supportive and loved the game. You know, it's even been

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:43.960
given some of its parody even was said to have blurred the

01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:47.840
line and go into the Dadaist expression. I thought that was

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:52.600
pretty funny. It is it does have some surreal moments like like

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:58.480
the whole part for me is the underwater level where a Bobo is

01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:02.960
having to, you know, swim through the Mario level and then

01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:06.280
there's like Bubble Man showing up and all kinds of interesting

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:08.440
enemies. It's just really trippy and out there.

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:13.320
I was reminded of Frog Fractions with how like not only

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:17.200
referential this game is to, you know, other video games, but

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:20.040
like how it's how it's really hodgepodge II, you know what I

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:23.080
mean? Like we just that's the point of it. Yeah, we just saw

01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:25.080
that scene you were talking about here on the video. The

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:29.280
whole like, underwater level from Mario meets a Mega Man boss

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:32.280
meets the goonies meets like this is the balloon fight one.

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:34.160
Yeah, it's just like everything going on at once. Let me see.

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:37.120
I'm gonna fast forward to one more scene here. Oh, this looks

01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:40.040
like pro wrestling where he's actually killing the wrestlers.

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.280
So that's that's something.

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.000
Yeah. I also really like the Mega Man one because he just

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.160
looks like his face has been photoshopped onto Mega Man's

01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:51.760
body, which is a bit further up. I think that's like the third to

01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:55.440
last one. And then there's the contra one and then punch the

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:59.400
punch out when there's before punch out there's what is this

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:05.960
is like Kirby. That's the contra one. But Oh, no, I can't show

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:09.240
this act deaf. This is you trying to kill Kirby with a

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:15.400
machine gun. That's bad. I'm pretty, pretty adorable. It is

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:17.800
pretty adorable. Like if Kirby is going to be a villain, this is

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:18.480
the way to do it.

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:19.600
That's awesome.

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:23.240
I agree with Bobby a drag race nest game called Super eight

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:31.880
bitch. Why are you our only hope? All right. Is that it? I

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:35.600
think that's it. There it is. Your class. It's Yeah, it's

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:43.560
pretty funny. Apparently, it's still available at sites.google.com

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:48.280
Um, and I wonder if this is Oh, yeah, I won't it won't play. You

01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:50.600
have to have like some browser let you do flash. But I think

01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:54.200
that someone out there if I remember right, I think someone

01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:58.840
out there did sort of messify it. But I'll see if I can find

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:05.240
like the website. And yeah, I click on the website and it's

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:10.400
just all Nope. So once on the internet being emulated by

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:13.640
ruffle. So it has to load but you can still play it. I'll

01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:14.280
link it in the chat.

01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:19.800
All right. There it is your classic game of the week of

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:27.800
Bobo's big adventure. A parody game of sorts. That, you know,

01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:29.880
this is kind of that's kind of fun to have, like, I guess,

01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:33.480
which would really be a homebrew game as the classic game of the

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:37.960
week, but any game is eligible, right? So why not? And I and

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:42.520
released games. Yeah. So I think I did space fantasy zone

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:47.920
once you did you did the the one that was the polybius. That

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:51.800
one. You did oblivious. Yeah, that one wants to so. Yeah, why

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:55.480
not? So there it is classic game of the week. And that's actually

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:59.200
the classic that never happened. That's one that I would love to

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:01.880
go back and revisit because it is so funny. And it's like I

01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:04.720
knew I knew of it back in the day, but I never I didn't spend

01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:07.920
a lot of time with it. I didn't realize just how many layers of

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.400
references deep it went. But that's pretty good. That really

01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.040
that does seem like a Loki game. Many people are in chatter

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.880
saying don't ask why why are Loki's the NES developer

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:20.080
remember? And I'm like, this is a Loki type of game. But I don't

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.920
know if Loki wants to make you gonna make us a super eight

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:23.440
bitch.

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.440
Oh, no.

01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:30.400
He's got he's a Minecraft content maker.

01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:34.280
I'm starting to work on visual novels. But I'm actually using a

01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:39.400
visual novel tool to do my my DBD machinima.

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:47.720
I'm here. All right, let's move on to rapid fire news. I have my

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:50.480
hosting gigs on the side. That's my other thing. All right. Let's

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.160
get a rapid fire.

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.880
Nervous breakdown on the side. That's okay.

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:58.040
Yeah, it's true. Is that too? Oh, am I my my weight loss? I'm a

01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:01.160
skinny. I have a side of skinny. All right, not really. But

01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:04.880
closer than it was. All right. Let's travel around and check

01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:08.720
out some other news going on in the industry. rapidly. That's

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:11.240
why it's rapid fire news. I'm going to step away real quick

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:13.480
because I need something to drink. So y'all keep rapid fire

01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.440
moving. I'll be back.

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:19.480
So Epic Games is actually giving away Borderlands three for a

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:24.880
limited time. It's available now until 826.

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:26.800
I totally downloaded it last night.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:33.080
Yeah, 8am Pacific time. So uh, yeah, you can check it out. Um,

01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:34.920
it's a great game. Unfortunately, I already

01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:38.520
purchased it when it came out. So can't get it for free, but

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:41.920
they're going to be doing some more giveaways here pretty soon

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:46.200
outside of this. But yeah, it's it's pretty nice. And then of

01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.760
course, they're also having a sale going on right now as well.

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:53.920
Along with that, there's news about the current generation

01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:57.480
version of the Witcher three, which is slated now to arrive at

01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:05.240
the end of 2022. And it's been delayed a bit. But you know, I

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:08.640
know that they've been busy with fixing cyberpunk and stuff like

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:14.000
that. But now they shared via Twitter that it is coming out

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:21.880
q4 2022 on PlayStation five and Xbox series X and s. So we'll

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.440
wait and see what that looks like.

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:30.000
Well, then, um, have actually have you gotten anything though

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.240
on the the sale that's going on?

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:38.760
I have not because I haven't really been buying games because

01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:42.680
I will and that's not true. I have purchased games, but I

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:46.280
don't play them. So no, I didn't pick up anything on the

01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:50.880
sale. Yeah, I haven't looked to see what they have because yeah,

01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:53.920
it's more stuff that just probably end up in my back log

01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:56.880
at some point. So at the finish for Lance three, I haven't even

01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.040
gone through all that. But

01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:07.400
for anyone on stadia right now, they're doing a sale on pac-man

01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:13.960
mega tunnel battle, and a few other goodies for it. And then

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:17.440
they also have like a bunch of the Assassin's Creed games on

01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:20.720
sales, city legends hundred days, there's actually a few

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:27.840
really good ones on there right now. And a bunch of stuff mark

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:31.320
down like the city skylines, stadia edition, just quite a few

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:34.360
things that's on sale right now, if you're another stadia player,

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:38.560
I'm outriders outriders is one of them on pro right now, that

01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:41.320
not a lot of the games have a deep discount on epic games

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:43.360
right now. The only thing that kind of jumps out at me right

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:46.080
now that they have in their top sellers is probably Red Dead

01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:49.440
Redemption two, which is half off right now. Tiny T's

01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:51.680
wonderlands like 20% off but like, yeah,

01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:54.520
yeah, I want to check out tiny Tina's wonderlands. But I'm

01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:56.640
kind of with you, Loki. I don't want to add to my backlog right

01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:59.320
now. But you know, I grabbed Borderlands three. I didn't have

01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:00.960
that yet. So I was like, yoink.

01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:04.920
That's a great game. It's a little cringe as far as the

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:08.640
story dialogue stuff goes, but the game itself is good. Yeah.

01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:11.640
Did you remember demos actually on stadia right now, including

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:12.440
chorus?

01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:16.640
Did your MSN chat says ttw is so good. Yeah, I want to check it

01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:17.440
out for sure.

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:23.960
Do well, I'm going into my news. I was trying to expand it to

01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.120
give you time to get some water.

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:27.080
Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'm back.

01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:33.280
So for anyone who's playing Kirby 64, the crystal shards

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:36.880
through Nintendo Switch Online, there is a game breaking bug.

01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:43.040
Um, when you are hit by a certain damage sources in the

01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:47.120
water, you become stunned indefinitely. And the only way

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:51.120
to get out of it is to quit the level. And so you can't finish

01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:54.520
really any of the underwater levels because if you get hit,

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:59.840
then you just stay that way. Um, no one remembers this glitch

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:03.560
being on the original console. So there has to be some

01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:05.760
interaction with the original programming and the emulation, I

01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:09.520
think. So there you go.

01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:12.680
Boy, I want to apologize to Mike Deft. He's having a rough

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:16.400
night. His fave is getting I mean, we just had him murdered

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:19.440
during the classic of the week. And then now it's getting shit

01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:24.560
on. He's it's breaking. He's definitely this is this night

01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:25.800
for Kirby. I apologize.

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:29.600
A giant Kirby though, just destroying everybody though is

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:31.040
pretty funny. I'm just gonna say.

01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:37.920
All right, we will not apologize for the cute imagery of a evil

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:40.880
Kirby taking over the world. I mean death by Kirby. What a what

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:41.680
a way to go right?

01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:43.040
Precisely.

01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:47.720
All right. That's it for rapid fire news.

01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.560
Pie culture kaiju Kirby.

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:52.680
Let's travel around the world and check out some release

01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:55.080
dates. Some things we'll be playing this week that don't

01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.280
have Kirby as a villain. Loki.

01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:02.640
I mean, anything's possible. I don't know. I don't. I don't

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:05.040
keep up with a lot of these games that are coming up and

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:09.960
maybe they do. So this week we've got hard space shipbreaker

01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:18.680
on PC. token Ranboo warriors on Nintendo Switch. Euro kill the

01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:23.080
culmination game on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and

01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:27.640
PlayStation five. sniper elite five on PC, PlayStation four,

01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:32.160
PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. And then we have

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:39.640
the legend of Niota boundless trails on Nintendo Switch. And

01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:43.440
what else that cow the kangaroo on PC, Nintendo Switch,

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:47.600
PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:54.640
My little pony a maritime Bay adventure on PC, Nintendo

01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:59.000
Switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one. And to go along with

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.080
Pacman's birthday Pacman museum plus on PC, Nintendo Switch,

01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:06.840
PlayStation four and Xbox one. That's it.

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:11.160
Still a lot of releases. But then I just remembered this

01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:14.080
weekend is Memorial Day. And that's like the unofficial

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:17.520
official kickoff of summer. So I guess this is always a big

01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:20.480
week for games. And the Yeah, when you kick off for summer,

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:23.640
that means you stop releasing video games, because that's

01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.600
typically how that goes. Yeah. Well, you got to get the games

01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:29.320
out for the kids to pick up for summer break or whatever,

01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:32.240
although our is the school year getting expanded in a lot of

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:34.560
places because of all the shutdowns? I don't know. I

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:37.000
don't know. It depends like that. It's different for

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.120
different districts. My son's off this week. So the other

01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:45.320
schools have taken upon themselves to add vacation

01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:48.160
weeks for every month. So some of those are going a little bit

01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:48.680
longer.

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:52.920
All right, let's go to Japan and check out the releases there.

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:56.960
It's actually pretty similar to what Loki already stated. So on

01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.640
the Nintendo Switch, we have radiant tale is out in Japan

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:04.200
this week. That Yuru kill the culmination games is also out in

01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:08.120
Japan this week. The Legend of Niota boundless trails also out

01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:10.840
in Japan this week. I think I heard Loki mentioned all those

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:14.920
games here. townsmen a kingdom rebuilt the complete addition.

01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:17.360
So I think that means DLC included with the base game.

01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:20.640
That is out from THQ Nordic in Japan this week on the switch

01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:24.920
and that Pac Man museum plus also gets a Japanese release

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:29.080
this week on the PlayStation. Oops, I went to four and I meant

01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:33.000
to go to five. Sometimes five has some different stuff. PS

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.880
foreign switch releases Japan are almost always identical with

01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:38.920
PlayStation five is sometimes has some different ones. That

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:43.040
Yuru kill combination games is also on PlayStation five. They

01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:46.640
also have the persistence enhanced is out in Japan this

01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:49.920
week. And Oh, interesting. Japan gets their version of five

01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:53.000
nights at Freddy's security breach this week. It is noted

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.120
this is an English version of the game. So it hasn't been

01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:57.960
completely localized, but it is getting officially released in

01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:02.360
Japan this week. So interesting. All right. And yeah, I agree

01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:05.160
with she Hulk and chat. Yes, please for Pac Man Museum. I'm

01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:08.520
looking forward to that as well. Dark Sakura. How about Europe?

01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:15.840
On the 24th we have eastward for switch. On the 26th we have

01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:21.040

adventure. And then also just on PlayStation we have mortal

01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:35.720
shell game of the year steelbook edition.

01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:38.600
Did you know the limited edition of that house of the

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:43.800
dead rerelease is called the limit dead edition. And I find

01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:44.360
that so funny.

01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:45.160
I love it.

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:48.760
Love to hear that worse the pun the better.

01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:55.160
We're getting to that age. All right. Let's move on. We have a

01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:58.640
few more stories for y'all. And then we'll take your calls and

01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:01.960
comments, emails, all that good stuff. And the listener

01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:04.360
roundtable. But first, we have a few more stories to get

01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:05.520
through. And we'll start with Loki.

01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:09.800
Like it's another week and we get to talk about Activision

01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:12.800
Blizzard and more trouble at their end. Of course, this time,

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:18.200
it's not about you know, all the misogyny and stuff going on. No,

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:26.040
we're going back, you know, has several months now back to the

01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:30.320
land of lawsuits because of gambling and minors. So we're

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:34.880
gambling and minors in this course being with loot packs.

01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:40.160
So the target of this is of course Hearthstone, specifically

01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:45.120
saying that people pay real world currency to gamble on

01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:50.280
winning in game items. And they won't provide refunds even when

01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:55.040
the purchases are completed by a minor. And apparently they argue

01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:59.520
that children comprise a large segment of their audience. And

01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:01.920
saying that it's unlawful, deceptive and misleading

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:05.600
tactics in Hearthstone. So I think the whole like, you know,

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:09.520
enticing people to buy those packs or something like that,

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:14.520
that, you know, it's, I don't know, a class action or

02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:20.200
something worthy. It's a stretch, I think, but like, I

02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:23.400
get it, you know, that they're saying it because it's targeted

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:27.360
towards everybody, but I don't know. Like some other countries,

02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:30.320
they've been able to kind of get away with, you know, making

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:34.440
that lawsuit type of thing happen. But I don't know if they

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:38.040
necessarily like, I don't see odds posted on this stuff.

02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.840
No, I don't think they have them. And maybe this is going to

02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:45.200
pressure them into doing it. But, you know, your kids can't

02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:48.160
keep buying this stuff if you watch what your kids get.

02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:53.240
Especially like the screenshot that they show is like a pack

02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:59.600
that's $125. Like that's a lot of money, like your kids aren't

02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:04.640
going to necessarily be buying that. Now to bring it back to my

02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.200
kids, like they do get a lot of money and like Roblox sometimes,

02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.240
especially or Roblox or whatever. It's like 100, almost

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:16.360
$100 during birthdays or stuff like that Christmas, and they'll

02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:19.520
blow it like instantly. So it's,

02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:23.760
yeah, if you see that if you give a child an unlimited

02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:27.320
balance, they will go through Yeah, yeah, I can see that. But

02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:30.640
like, you know, I don't know, like they're saying that there

02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:34.080
is one, one of the people that are part of the lawsuit said

02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:38.400
this child spent over $300 on the Hearthstone between 2019

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:44.120
and 2021. Actually, not that much, honestly, like, like, oh,

02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:46.240
they were made without his permission using his credit card

02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:48.400
and debit cards. Yeah. But at the same time, though, that

02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:50.760
that's your fault for not securing your financial stuff

02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:54.520
to that. That's the same as like, you know, having kids or

02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:57.880
teenagers stealing cash out of your purse or something like

02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:01.280
that. Like it's, if you don't secure your finance, financial

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:05.680
stuff, like, yeah, that can happen. But that's not the

02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:09.840
game's fault. But at the same time, I'm not going to say that

02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:14.680
like, you know, they aren't trying to tap into that whole

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:19.320
gambling FOMO type of mindset when it comes to selling these

02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:22.920
packs, because they want you to feel like you need to buy them.

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:24.640
And so they're going to advertise them like that.

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.840
All right. Well, there's I saw I even though I think there's

02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:34.440
kind of a part of me that's like, yeah, get Activision

02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:37.040
Blizzard, get them, get them, especially Bobby Kotick, get

02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:40.360
him, like, personally, he should be sued for this just because

02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:42.720
he's still the CEO of the company. But that's not the

02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:45.240
realist of the situation. I think in this particular

02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:47.920
situation, like you've just you've got to put some onus on

02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:51.000
the parents for how much their kids are spending. You know,

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:57.600
when I ran up $100 prodigy bill from using chat rooms, I got I

02:02:57.600 --> 02:02:59.920
don't want to say beat up because it wasn't that I didn't

02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:03.640
have that but but but verbally, I got some verbal lashings over

02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:07.160
the whole thing and grounded fucking grounded like hell and

02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:11.640
not able to use any of prodigy anymore after that for a little

02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:13.720
while. So you know, you got it. You got to put some

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:16.960
responsibility on, you know, laying down the law when your

02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:20.840
kids get out of control with that stuff. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah,

02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:23.760
I'm with Mike Deft. As much as we want to dunk on a BK right

02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:28.120
now. This ain't it. I and I agree. This ain't it. So. All

02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:33.160
right. Let's move on. I wonder if this will be it will sit dark

02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:33.720
Sakura.

02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:41.120
Well, I think it's, I don't know. So McDonald's is making a

02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:44.920
video game. I mean, we did have Burger King do it. But this one

02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:50.680
instead make kids is one more Burger King game so bad, like so

02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:51.200
bad.

02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:52.720
Let the story be read, Loki.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.360
Anyway, it's sort of an advertisement sort of game.

02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:02.360
It's called McDonald's crush the rush. And you play as an

02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:07.400
employee working with drive thru orders. I mean, wasn't

02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:11.880
there like what an over like a waitress game? I think it sounds

02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:13.240
like root beer tapper.

02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:15.880
No, it's, it's

02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:19.480
a cafe, like Cafe Crush or something like that or like

02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:20.560
cafe, diner,

02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:26.120
dash, diner, dash, something ish. I mean, basically, what you

02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:29.540
have to do is you go to your different stations and you make

02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:31.840
the different things and you get what you need. It almost looks

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:35.720
like a Sims view from up top. But basically, it's just

02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:39.440
clicking the order of items and get your team to work as

02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:41.640
efficiently as possible. And they want to make it look like

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:46.400
food service is fun and entertaining. But it is

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:50.720
repetitive gameplay. The whole thing is just to try to get

02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:53.500
people to work for McDonald's. And I don't know who would want

02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:54.000
to do that.

02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:59.720
I honestly like if I can't imagine somebody plays angles.

02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:04.940
Yeah, okay. I like that. Well, it seems like wasted. So I mean,

02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:08.380
I think of America's Army, you know, that was also a recruitment

02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:10.700
tool for a game and apparently they were actually fun. Yeah,

02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:11.500
apparently did pretty well.

02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:12.780
But they're solid games.

02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:16.340
Fanara wants to point out to Overcooked, which was also on

02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:18.260
the tip of my tongue. That was it. That's another one of those

02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:19.780
like team prep games. Yeah, yeah.

02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:24.740
That's that's a different type of game. Yeah. But yeah, I'm

02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:31.140
with, we need the king as dead by daylight killer for sure.

02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:33.300
Well, definitely is scary enough.

02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:36.700
Oh my god. I mean, McDonald's has all of these great

02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:39.500
characters that they're not using for games like they, you

02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:42.720
know, I mean, forget the Burger King. How about the fucking

02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:46.740
grimace from McDonald's? That would be a scary I mean, that

02:05:46.740 --> 02:05:50.060
practically is clown in that hippo outfit, but still like the

02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:54.260
grimace would be a scary fucking dead by daylight killer or the

02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:58.780
Hamburglar. Or what's what's the other one? Then there's the

02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:02.660
the their their friend with the pigtails. Yeah, the birdie? I

02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:05.140
think her name is literally birdie birdie the early bird.

02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:05.580
Yeah.

02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:11.500
And then we got it. Then we got to really go back and get the

02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:14.580
moon. Whatever that was big. Was it Mac?

02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:16.740
It was Mac. Mac tonight.

02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:20.900
No, what I want is the Hamburglar to be the killer.

02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:24.460
And then the fry guys to be like out in the map like with

02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:28.620
Nemesis and the zombies. Which by the way, I have officially

02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:35.060
stolen a couple of zombie names from other streamers. So we name

02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:35.740
our zombies.

02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:39.700
I would really go for like a dead by daylight game that's

02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:44.020
just with fast food mascots. Like let's let's do it.

02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:47.620
The five night Freddy's five nights at Freddy's rumor for DBD

02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:51.420
will never dies. Now it's been rumored for the last like seven

02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:55.140
DLC is and they still say oh, it's coming. It's coming. Five

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.260
nights at Freddy's coming.

02:06:56.900 --> 02:07:00.820
Keep in mind too is that and they even said so in a very

02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:03.540
recent interview that when they're working on DLC, they're

02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:09.740
working on anywhere between like four to 10 extras a year to come

02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:14.660
out and in in in following years. Like the apparently the

02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:18.140
Candyman one is still floating around and has a lot of credence

02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:18.540
with it.

02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:24.140
Um, listen, boy chat room really loves this McDonald's cross step

02:07:24.140 --> 02:07:26.980
by daylight, I guess with Burger King thrown in there as well.

02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:30.740
You know, Chad is really eating this up. So there there's

02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:36.620
I guess I'll show 100 Matt's comment. The Burger King Kids

02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:38.620
Club grows up to be a cult like the purge.

02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:41.740
Oh, now me just added Wendy's to the mix because why not?

02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:44.860
Oh, you know, Wendy would just dominate. She'd be like the

02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:49.540
nurse. Difficult to master but once you do, everyone's your

02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:50.020
bitch.

02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:54.300
There was a comment I was gonna read up here. Oh, yeah. Oh,

02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:57.580
teacher teacher on SS Do you get paid a living wage for playing

02:07:57.580 --> 02:08:01.420
this game? Oh, that was a true that was the truth that was

02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:06.620
killed by truth. Um, for Nara said, Do they have DLC for this

02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:10.460
McDonald's game for the McFood game that has the drunk or stone

02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:15.980
customers and Karen DLC to real to real.

02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:19.340
That's awesome. That's like her other comment. Wendy's social

02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:20.620
media manager is a part.

02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:27.300
I was gonna say this the stone customers, they're at Jack in

02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:31.100
the Box because number one, everybody in America knows the

02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:34.660
McFlurry machine. And that's what you want is always broken

02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:35.980
after a certain hour.

02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:39.740
But hex session one sauce.

02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:47.620
But Jack in the Box specifically caters to stoners like they

02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:51.580
advertised it as what do you think those late night munchy

02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:54.620
boxes are like legitimately they sell something at Jack in the

02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:57.420
Box. I know Jack in the Box isn't a nationwide chain. I

02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:00.740
think they're they're good. I Jack in the Box would have an

02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:02.300
add on called three day old grease.

02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:06.860
But but Jack in the Box specifically has like a late

02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:11.300
night thing that's like a few jalapeno poppers, some popcorn

02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:15.220
chicken, an egg roll, some curly fries, like it's like a literally

02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:18.580
a little bit of everything. But it's only available after 11

02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:19.100
o'clock.

02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:24.820
And we know exactly why.

02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:28.900
Do you know you know how we have barbecue and chili? Hmm. Yeah, I

02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:33.380
think for Wendy's, it would be a chicken nuggets and Frosty's.

02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:37.380
Yeah, chicken nuggets and Frosty's. All right. Yeah. All

02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:41.500
right, we got to move on. Let's move on to another story. Loki, I

02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:42.260
think this is yours.

02:09:43.140 --> 02:09:48.660
Yeah, so Nintendo is ramping up their fight against cheaters

02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:53.020
because they have their new eSports game right around the

02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:58.860
corner with Splatoon three. So they are pants are patenting a

02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:04.860
new anti cheat program. Okay, apparently they're saying they'd

02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:09.380
use something called code reuse techniques to auto generate

02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:12.660
attestation programs to detect whether a game has been

02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:17.100
modified. I don't know what that means. But they're going to do

02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:22.060
something to try to stop people from using hacked copies or

02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:26.060
running fake ones or something like that. And then

02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:30.980
it sounds like it's not just cheating in games, but trying to

02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:33.740
get people to stop like launching homebrew and down

02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:37.180
piracy. Really, it's a pirate, which I understand that, you

02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:40.740
know, I don't I'm not a fan of pirating current games and so

02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:45.700
forth. But yeah, and I think they should be getting

02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:48.980
especially with online games. I don't give a shit if you cheat

02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:51.660
in a single player game. Like if you're cheating in Super Mario

02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:56.140
Sunshine, or boy, that's a dated reference. Super Mario Odyssey.

02:10:56.180 --> 02:10:58.260
Well, hell, you can cheat and sunshine too, because that was

02:10:58.260 --> 02:11:02.340
in the the recent Mario pack. Mario All Stars they did. But if

02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:04.500
you cheat in those games, I don't fucking care because it

02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:07.500
doesn't affect anything else. But if you cheat a Mario Kart

02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:11.100
online, then I'm mad. So Nintendo should be taking steps

02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:12.180
to prevent that. Right?

02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:18.580
Exactly. They should be. But I don't know. I think they're the

02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:22.140
downside, though, is I mean, the device is made, it's based off

02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:25.380
of an Android device, and it can run native Android. It's like,

02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:28.540
it's gonna be hard, or it's gonna be easy for people to

02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:31.020
circumvent all that stuff. That's how we have all this

02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:35.060
crazy, you know, emulation stuff. I mean, I don't know,

02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:37.460
it's gonna be hard for them to do it. But I'm sure they'll

02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:43.780
try. I don't know. Anything that reduces the number of hackers

02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:46.340
that they have in like Splatoon stuff, I guess.

02:11:46.940 --> 02:11:49.500
And I can see why they want to get that going in advance of

02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:53.740
Splatoon three as well. Yeah, yeah, definitely. So that the

02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:57.020
chat is still talking about fast food. And now they're talking

02:11:57.020 --> 02:12:01.340
about I see Taco Bell versus Del Taco. I'm gonna come at you

02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:04.620
with a real hot take. What is the big fucking deal about

02:12:04.620 --> 02:12:05.460
Mexican pizza?

02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:10.300
What is it's fucking delicious. It's like one of the only things

02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:13.460
there that I like. I don't think it's then again, I mean,

02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:15.740
honestly, the last time I ate at Taco Bell, it was so disgusting.

02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:18.020
It's like, just give me Del Taco all the time.

02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:21.300
They're soft. They're trying. Mexican pizza is a gigantic

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:25.820
soggy nacho. That is what it is to me. I don't get it.

02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:30.100
Mike Defton chat says I asked the same thing and I don't get

02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:33.180
it. I'm gonna Mike Deft. You live in Mexico. Is that is that

02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:36.860
a pizza? Is that a pizza? I don't think it is.

02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:44.700
It's just it's just it's a giant stacked torta, I guess.

02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:47.380
Let's see other comments in chat. Sia Tabiri says Dolly

02:12:47.380 --> 02:12:50.980
Parton would like a word with you, Rob. I know. I know. Dolly

02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:56.060
Parton is my queen. But even even the people you hold in the

02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:59.420
highest highest regard are not perfect people. And Dolly Parton

02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:02.740
is allowed to make a mistake whenever she wants. But this is

02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:07.060
this is her mistake. Um, let's see. Kind Volibian chat says

02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:10.780
Del Taco gets so much slander for no reason. It is amazing. I

02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:15.660
have to agree that Del Taco is so much better. It's like it's

02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:19.300
the only place you can get a taco and fries. It's great.

02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:22.380
I don't like their fries. Their fries are super dry.

02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:26.540
I can't eat fries anymore anyway. So it doesn't really

02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:31.060
matter. But I like the tacos. All right. Mike Deft in chat

02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:34.780
says an actual Mexican pizza. So for the record, for the record,

02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:39.260
an actual Mexican pizza from our listener who lives in Mexico is

02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:44.260
a pizza in all caps with traditional Mexican ingredients

02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:48.380
like chorizo or pepper. I could see that I could see that.

02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:51.700
That's actually that sounds good. It's like a chorizo as a

02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:54.740
topping up. That sounds good. Actually, I would not be able to

02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:57.780
eat it with all the peppers in it. I Yeah, I know. It's you

02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:02.900
still to this day. My favorite pizza is California Pizza

02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:06.060
Kitchen's parent Gorgonzola pizza with plenty of roasted

02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:08.860
garlic on it. The end. That's the best pizza in the world and

02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:10.140
no one can convince me otherwise.

02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:15.220
I never thought of chorizo on pizza. Now I'm like, that sounds

02:14:15.220 --> 02:14:18.580
fucking good. All right. I mean, the peppers that might be a bit

02:14:18.580 --> 02:14:21.260
much, but we'll see. We'll see. Maybe a little I can handle I

02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:23.340
can handle a little bit of pepper. I just don't like a ton

02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:25.380
of it because it peppers one of those things that's just like it

02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:29.100
dominates the taste. So let's Yeah, like I love

02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:32.940
I bet though if you deseeded the peppers and roasted them really

02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:36.860
well, like almost blackened them. It would take some of the

02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:40.220
heat out of it. Yeah, I mean, I still wouldn't be able to have

02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:42.220
it because the enzymes will still be active even if they're

02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:46.660
roasted. But this the heat is in the seeds for the most part. So

02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:49.060
you deseed it and roast it really well. You get

02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:52.380
caramelization on it. And the flavor profile would actually

02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:54.500
work well with the harder chorizo.

02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:57.500
We have a really good rex Kim restaurant not far from here.

02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:00.820
And I don't know how authentic it is. Sorry, Mike deaf. But I

02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:03.340
love to get they have a fajita salad as like my favorite thing

02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:06.220
on the menu for this current like diet I'm doing. And they

02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:08.580
put peppers in it. But it's like you said, they blackened them a

02:15:08.580 --> 02:15:11.460
little bit. So it doesn't like overpower everything else is I

02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:13.860
love the fajita salad there. It's so good. It's like the

02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:17.860
perfect lunch for me. Anyway, yeah. St 100 Matt says OLR foodie

02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:20.460
episode is happening now. Oops, oops. Yeah, well, we've put that

02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:23.980
off way too long. But that is 100% my fault. So we'll get that

02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:27.740
scheduled very soon. Mike deaf says if it's run by Mexicans,

02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:33.180
then I trust it. I believe so. I've never asked but I believe

02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:39.340
so. So it we we don't usually have a problem finding decent

02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:43.460
Mexican food in California. Yeah, yeah, it's it's not hard

02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:46.340
to find but it ain't a Taco Bell. All right.

02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:54.980
I mean, we we I have everything from super taco to taqueria

02:15:54.980 --> 02:16:00.540
Vallarta to what's my other taco place? There's the truck that

02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:06.020
comes to work sometimes. And nothing is as as good as a good

02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:08.420
taco truck. And then like one of my favorite burger places was

02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:12.540
actually a chain started by a Mexican family called Tommy's.

02:16:13.140 --> 02:16:16.100
Oh, yeah. That's the place with the chili on the burgers. Yeah,

02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:19.220
you you made us detour to a Tommy's. It wasn't that far of a

02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:21.460
detour. But you were like, we got to get Tommy's way home.

02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:26.820
Yeah. Yeah. All right. We have one more story for you before we

02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:29.780
get to the listener roundtable. And that is to talk about what I

02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:33.540
think is a very interesting turn of fate. And, you know, there's

02:16:33.540 --> 02:16:38.220
been a lot of talk about Warner Brothers latest Smash esque sort

02:16:38.220 --> 02:16:41.700
of game called multi versus. In fact, I think people are

02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:45.380
streaming that on Twitch and stuff right now. I have a sneeze

02:16:45.380 --> 02:16:49.180
coming on. Thank God I hit the mute button in time. Sorry,

02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:54.260
guys. Um, so multi versus is like a smash s kind of game

02:16:54.260 --> 02:16:57.260
that's an alpha right now. Well, apparently the game is good

02:16:57.260 --> 02:17:00.380
enough or the right agreements have been signed where multi

02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:06.340
versus is going to be at Evo championship series for 2022. In

02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:11.420
fact, it's taking smashes spot. Now, you might remember Nintendo

02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:15.780
pulled smash from Evo. So it's kind of their own fucking fault.

02:17:15.980 --> 02:17:19.820
So it is very interesting that, okay, well, we're gonna replace

02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:24.580
smash with a smash esque or a smash inspired, we'll say, type

02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:29.540
of game instead. So that's very interesting. So yeah, Nintendo

02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:32.820
had pulled out of Evo. But we just we still don't know why

02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:35.380
Nintendo pulled out. But then we had the panda global

02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:37.940
partnership. So maybe it was something like that. But now

02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:42.860
Evo has multi versus so made this, you know, could Nintendo

02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:47.540
have shot themselves in the foot by letting this get picked up

02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:51.140
by Evo. And now the fans are going to focus on it. People are

02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:54.620
going to practice with this game. You know, I it's it's kind

02:17:54.620 --> 02:17:57.820
of giving this game a leg up by its ability to be included in

02:17:57.820 --> 02:18:01.260
Evo. So it'll be interesting to see. Quest Buster says an open

02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:05.300
beta is slated for multi versus in July. And I've seen a few

02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:07.420
streams that looks like the devs have a lot of fun with the

02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:12.060
characters. So Mike Deaf says panda global is partnering with

02:18:12.060 --> 02:18:16.660
Nintendo and Sony running Evo. So you know, so yeah, it's true

02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:23.940
Sony Sony bought Evo too. So anyway, let's go to the listener

02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:27.780
roundtable. Every week we invite your feedback here on the show

02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:31.340
over at twitch.tv slash vog network. We also take your

02:18:31.340 --> 02:18:35.740

02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:38.300
stepped away for a moment we'll, we'll ask her when she

02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:42.700
gets back we have any emails I don't think there were. We also

02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:45.900
invite your calls if you want to join our discord server over at

02:18:45.900 --> 02:18:49.540
vog network.com slash discord. We chat throughout the week

02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:52.220
about stuff or if you want to you can join the green room,

02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:54.620
which is one of our chat channels and we'll take some

02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:58.340
calls here live on air. If you don't want to do any of that,

02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:05.100
we'll always be happy to take a chat questions over in our chat

02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:08.180
room over twitch.tv slash vog network where they're still

02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:10.540
talking about multiverses, which is fine because we were just

02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:14.860
talking about that. While we wait to see if any questions

02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:18.060
well, let me get some comments here. Tiger class as I think

02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:21.700
it's good that multiverses will be at Evo. It gives the game of

02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:24.420
ton of exposure and might have more people wanting to play it.

02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:27.500
And kind of Vullaby says I've already seen a number of pro

02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:31.220
smash players trying multiverses and it seems popular with them.

02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:34.100
I guess time will tell if it's just another fad or not though

02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:37.860
kind of like Nick all stars brawl. It's true. That one was

02:19:37.860 --> 02:19:40.980
supposed to be a big one and the shade is real came in when it

02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:43.860
has all the voice actors in this one. So that's cool. Yeah, it's

02:19:43.860 --> 02:19:46.980
true. It does. Dark soccer. Do we? I don't think we have

02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:49.060
anything in the mailbag. But let me check just to be sure. Oh,

02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:52.040
no, we do not. Alright, so participate at orange

02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:56.540
launchradio.com. Oh, so I always say when when you don't email us

02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:59.020
and give us something to talk about, then it's an excuse for

02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:02.100
dark soccer and I to talk about drag race. Now for the most part

02:20:02.100 --> 02:20:04.580
in the last year, I haven't bothered to watch drag race

02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:06.540
because there's just there's too many of them now there's there's

02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:10.700
the international one. There's the but they just give me a

02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:14.380
couple of seasons. They just started the all winners one. So

02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:18.100
all stars all winners started on Friday. And all I'm gonna say

02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:20.660
I'm not going to spoil because the Paramount thing is weird

02:20:20.660 --> 02:20:22.940
because now that it's on streaming people watch at

02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:27.660
different times. All I'm gonna say is this is the shakeup the

02:20:27.660 --> 02:20:32.900
format has needed for a long, long time. And I'll say I don't

02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:36.460
think it's a spoiler for me to say the show is now edited to be

02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:41.580
99% positive. All the judges critiques positive, all of the

02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:44.140
edits that the players got during snatch game and during

02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:47.500
the first challenge, positive, everything was positive. And the

02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:50.660
show is not hurting because of it. Like it's actually probably

02:20:50.660 --> 02:20:54.100
the strongest season they've had in a long time. So it was just

02:20:54.100 --> 02:20:56.820
it's amazing. And all I said that snatch game, you know,

02:20:56.820 --> 02:20:58.900
again, I don't know if that's just because of editing where

02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:01.420
they chose to show the positive but I really think like the

02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:06.660
talent that was in that snatch game like jinx monsoon. That's

02:21:06.660 --> 02:21:09.500
the tweet. That's like there there there will never be

02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:11.860
another better there will never be a better game player than

02:21:11.860 --> 02:21:12.260
jinx months.

02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:17.420
I love I loved meeting her. She she's just so funny in person.

02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:23.820
You you have to see the snatch game she does. So can I can I

02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:25.260
can I tell you who she does?

02:21:25.740 --> 02:21:26.380
Who does she do?

02:21:26.460 --> 02:21:28.820
So the twist is that they have to do

02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:31.540
because before she did little Edie before right did she does

02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:34.860
somebody different they have to do two characters this time. So

02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:38.420
they actually do two different snatch games. The first game she

02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:42.420
does Natasha Lyonne from my Russian doll the redhead right

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:46.940
who isn't but I'm here. Oh my god she had the voice because

02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:49.780
you because you know Natasha Lyonne has a very distinctive

02:21:49.780 --> 02:21:53.580
raspy voice probably from all the smoking. She had the voice

02:21:53.740 --> 02:22:01.220
down. The second celebrity she does Judy Garland. It Jamie it

02:22:01.220 --> 02:22:06.740
was mind blowingly good. Like you laugh until you cry. It was

02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:10.380
so good. It was so good. You have to watch it like I'll loan

02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:14.260
you my because I mean, when when what's your name did a Liza

02:22:14.260 --> 02:22:19.420
Minnelli. That was dead on and I can see jinx pulling off a

02:22:19.420 --> 02:22:22.220
perfect Judy Garland. I would love to see the two of them

02:22:22.220 --> 02:22:27.500
together. Yeah. So but but jinx has a really good talent for

02:22:27.500 --> 02:22:29.980
voices because her little Edie was pretty dead on to

02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:35.020
Raja does a celebrity. I have to tell you who Raja does one of

02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:37.180
them at least. Sorry. Sorry, Loki.

02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:38.180
Just tell me both.

02:22:39.460 --> 02:22:43.420
Diana Vreeland is one of the ones that she Raja does. And

02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:45.620
that's that's like the the person that was over Vogue

02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:48.300
magazine like in the 70s and 80s. So that was that was fine.

02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:53.660
That was funny. But she does Madam. The puppet from wailing

02:22:53.660 --> 02:23:01.820
flowers and Madam. It is Jamie. It's, it's so good. It's so

02:23:01.820 --> 02:23:02.340
good.

02:23:03.700 --> 02:23:06.260
The winners on the season or is it just a handful of all

02:23:06.260 --> 02:23:06.900
winners?

02:23:07.100 --> 02:23:15.060
It's um, it's Raja, jinx, Shea couleé, Monet exchange, not

02:23:15.060 --> 02:23:22.540
Bianca, Trinity, the tuck, the Vivian from the UK. Did I say

02:23:22.540 --> 02:23:23.380
jinx already?

02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:24.420
Yeah.

02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:29.020
Oh, Jada, Essence Hall, and Evie Oddly.

02:23:30.140 --> 02:23:31.020
I love Evie.

02:23:31.420 --> 02:23:35.540
So it's a really good cast. So even though Yeah,

02:23:35.580 --> 02:23:36.620
he's also a sweetheart.

02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:39.180
There's a lot of people that are like, Where's Bianca? Where's

02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:43.500
Trixie? Where's Alaska? I think these are a lot of girls that

02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:46.340
like are absolutely like not to say the others aren't worth

02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:48.780
revisiting. But there are a lot of them are booked and blessed.

02:23:48.780 --> 02:23:50.980
And I'm sure these winners could be booked and blessed too. But to

02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:53.940
be on TV again and go through all this is really, really great

02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:56.260
for them. And it's just Yeah, and I'm sure they're saving some

02:23:56.260 --> 02:23:58.900
for a potential second season down the line. So

02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:04.860
I will. I will also tell you that I'm perfectly happy for

02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:07.460
Tracy to not be on there if I can keep watching her use Easy

02:24:07.460 --> 02:24:11.980
Bake Ovens. Anyway, I had Dan watching that he was laughing.

02:24:12.380 --> 02:24:16.060
Jamie, it was a it was a Waylon Flowers and Madam reference.

02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:19.300
Like only like only people over 40 are gonna understand why

02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:22.300
that's so fucking funny. But that was the stuff that was on

02:24:22.300 --> 02:24:22.940
late at night.

02:24:23.620 --> 02:24:29.140
I will. I will have to go YouTube-ify it.

02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:31.740
Or just ask me nicely for my Paramount Plus.

02:24:31.740 --> 02:24:34.380
We actually have Paramount Plus now so Dan can watch Star Trek.

02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:35.540
Well, then get on it.

02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:39.860
Eventually, eventually. All right. I got I got shit to do.

02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:42.500
Like I still have to finish doing the cat video again. I

02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:43.900
need to send me more pictures of cheddar.

02:24:44.740 --> 02:24:49.100
Oh, yeah, I need to send you cheddar cat pics for for a

02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:51.900
redone intro video here for when we're live on Sunday nights.

02:24:51.900 --> 02:24:55.700
Absolutely. So I'd love to have a new one for our 20th. Because

02:24:55.700 --> 02:24:57.420
I don't know what else we're gonna have for our 20th.

02:24:59.260 --> 02:25:01.180
Maybe that should be the foodie episode.

02:25:01.580 --> 02:25:04.540
Um, I think we should definitely get that done before the 20th.

02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:07.220
Yeah. So I'll have to check with everyone's availability, though,

02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:08.820
because I know you're going on a big trip, Jamie, you're not

02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:11.500
gonna be here next week. So I'm gonna be here next week. It's the

02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:17.700
week after. Um, I am flying to Illinois on June 2. And I'm

02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:22.740
returning on the fifth. I'm helping my friend move her cats.

02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:27.700
You are who has been who you have seen in in my streams, and

02:25:27.700 --> 02:25:30.740
she's coming here as well. Amethyst Rose, which Oh, yeah, I

02:25:30.740 --> 02:25:33.460
know the name. Yeah, yeah. My, my friend who also lives around

02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:37.180
the corner for me. Um, basically, the cats can't go in

02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:42.580
the car because of, you know, nervous reasons. So we in Delta,

02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:45.820
which we're taking, we're doing first class, which I've never

02:25:45.860 --> 02:25:51.580
done first class before. So come on celebrity. Well, I'm doing

02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:55.740
the the comfort economy on the way back, at least it's the, you

02:25:55.740 --> 02:26:00.780
know, the comfort seats. But, but because, you know, we got

02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:03.260
to check the luggage because the cats are going to be a carry on

02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:07.980
each. And I'm going to be probably really drunk by the

02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:08.620
time we land.

02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:14.020
Just saying, what part of Illinois, not Chicago, I guess,

02:26:14.060 --> 02:26:18.620
just the rest of four hours from Chicago. Okay, without doxing a

02:26:18.620 --> 02:26:22.420
fellow. Sure, sure. I understand. Yeah. So so but I'm, I

02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:28.260
would like to go into Chicago, but we're flying into St. Louis.

02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:31.740
And I said, Okay, you know, it's gonna happen. I double check to

02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:34.420
make sure I could. We're going to the Waffle House.

02:26:36.620 --> 02:26:41.020
I checked. I don't miss I did. I already checked. Okay, I was

02:26:41.020 --> 02:26:44.060
gonna say Missy OLR St. Louis base. So I'd Yeah, cool.

02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:48.220
I said we are going to the damn Waffle House. You're gonna have

02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:51.820
the grits and you're gonna like it. No, I'm kidding. I don't if

02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:55.820
she doesn't like it. She doesn't like it. But um, I like I think

02:26:55.820 --> 02:26:58.580
I have like three bags of grits that I promised one to my

02:26:58.580 --> 02:27:02.300
co worker and I might just pick up some more on the way back.

02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:05.420
Like if I get there early enough, I might stop into a

02:27:05.420 --> 02:27:07.180
Waffle House. See if the managers there because you can

02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:11.580
buy grits over the counter 99 cents a bag. Awesome. And at

02:27:11.580 --> 02:27:14.900
last, I freaking love Waffle House grits now. Now some folks

02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:17.740
in chat are like, Hey, Jamie's gonna be near me. I want to go

02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:20.300
drive. Well, I'm gonna be near you briefly because we still

02:27:20.300 --> 02:27:24.500
have to get those cats. Yeah. To my friend's place. Yeah. All

02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:26.660
right. Well, that'll be a fun trip. That's that'll be cool.

02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:29.700
I it's a place I've never been before a couple places I've

02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:32.700
never been before. I'd love to do a long drive across the

02:27:32.700 --> 02:27:38.700
country. At some point, but you know, time money. Her her

02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:42.660
husband, I think is doing the the drive with all the the

02:27:42.660 --> 02:27:46.820
moving stuff. And we're doing even know either that or they're

02:27:46.820 --> 02:27:49.620
having movers do it and he's flying on his own to get start

02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:52.140
getting stuff set up and then we're flying together on it.

02:27:53.220 --> 02:27:56.460
Yeah. All right. Let me go to Loki and see if there's any

02:27:56.460 --> 02:27:59.660
last minute stories for tonight to get into because mostly I

02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:02.180
don't see I didn't see any questions from chat. If I missed

02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:05.020
it, please ask it again. But most most of chat is just

02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:08.220
adding to what dark soccer is talking about with her story

02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:08.500
there.

02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:13.700
Sadly, there's not really anything last minute. Fair

02:28:13.700 --> 02:28:17.260
enough. I imagine next week's gonna be a bit of a slow week

02:28:17.260 --> 02:28:19.740
with it being Memorial Day weekends, a little bit of a long

02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:22.180
weekend, or maybe that affects the week after I don't know.

02:28:22.500 --> 02:28:27.380
Oh, all right. Well, then I guess that is going to do it for

02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:30.060
another episode of orange launch radio. Hey, thank you as always

twitch over twitch.tv slash vog network. Really appreciate all

02:28:58.940 --> 02:29:03.420
of that. So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or

02:29:03.460 --> 02:29:07.300
wherever it is you found this Spotify. What else is out there?

02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:09.600
I don't even know anywhere wherever whatever you used to

02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:13.020
find this a going off a long way. So yeah, Mike Deaf says

02:29:13.020 --> 02:29:15.820
Summer Games Fest is close. So it's the calm before the storm,

02:29:15.820 --> 02:29:20.620
I guess. Yep. And since there's no E3 this year, those type of

02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:22.780
summer announcements are just going to be sprinkled throughout

02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:24.860
the next three months because you'll notice Sony has not

02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:28.300
staked a claim. And I think they're waiting. I don't think

02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:30.300
we're going to see Sony in June. I think we're going to see them

02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:33.460
closer to end of July, August, because they don't have nothing

02:29:33.460 --> 02:29:35.700
else is forcing them to go earlier. So they're on their own

02:29:35.700 --> 02:29:40.420
timetable. So be very interesting. So all right. Um,

02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:44.580
and dark to see you. Yes, I did see what you were working on. But

02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:49.620
I'll wait and talk about that during the 20th. So let's see.

02:29:50.260 --> 02:29:53.420
That's it that I can think of. So this is the part where we go

02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:56.100
around and get everybody's final thoughts. I will start with dark

02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:59.300
Sakura because I know she's going to do a post stream for

02:29:59.300 --> 02:30:01.300
y'all. Dark Sakura, your final thought.

02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:04.940
Um, I need blood points. I gotta feed a legion.

02:30:06.260 --> 02:30:11.080
All right, good luck with the some growing a teenagers quote

02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:14.520
finger. Good luck teenagers. Sorry, stabbing and killing in

02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:18.420
dead by daylight. All right. Exactly. Later taters. Have a

02:30:18.420 --> 02:30:21.860
good one. Loki will go to you in your final thought for

02:30:21.860 --> 02:30:22.300
tonight.

02:30:23.140 --> 02:30:26.260
I just saw that power wash simulator added more levels. So

02:30:26.340 --> 02:30:27.940
I need to check that out again.

02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:32.120
My final thought is I was just saying to a friend the other

02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:35.220
day, I want to play a game like Diablo again, but I don't really

02:30:35.220 --> 02:30:37.780
want to play Diablo. My friend was like, Oh, Diablo immortals

02:30:37.780 --> 02:30:38.900
coming out. And I was like,

02:30:40.020 --> 02:30:40.940
is there anything else?

02:30:42.260 --> 02:30:46.140
Anything else? I mean, I haven't found engines. Oh, yeah, now

02:30:46.140 --> 02:30:48.300
they're now you're talking maybe I'll pick up Minecraft

02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:50.660
Dungeons again. That was kind of fun when I played it. So that'll

02:30:50.660 --> 02:30:55.660
be fun. So. All right. Wow, as Joe and Matt says, I'm sadly
