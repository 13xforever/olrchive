0	14120	Video games are art, and like all art, they are all what you make of it. They're unique
14120	18620	for all other applications of art because you are a primary part of it. Alongside video
18620	22720	games live, play, and plenty more productions to BBC is getting into the game of orchestral
22720	27720	presentations of select music pieces, and I am pumped to see this. This is one art jumping
27720	31880	mediums and culture story. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to
31880	35120	tell you more about this headline and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the
35120	36800	show where every gamer has a voice.
41200	45920	Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where
45920	54240	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode
54320	64600	number 912 for our show for May the first. It is May 2022. I am Rob Roberts and joining me as he
64600	67840	does every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki.
68920	69360	Hello.
69360	70240	How are you doing?
71080	72000	I'm doing better.
72040	76680	Good, good. I was gonna ask you were out last week because you had your surgery. So you're here.
76680	81200	You're looking normal. You're upbeat. So good. We were all hoping it would go this way where you
81200	84880	just you're gonna just go right back into doing the show and all that stuff. But everything's
84880	85480	going well.
86160	93160	Yeah, it's going well. I took a week watch it. I have a few more days off still. Because they're
93160	99480	finishing up the last piece of I guess the recovery where they have to take out the stent that they
99480	103600	put in. So that's tomorrow. So looking forward to that.
106320	106640	Let's
106640	109760	take a moment to reflect on the fact that getting old sucks.
111120	116640	Yes. And I like it too. Like because because you know, the whole kidney stone thing they said, you
116640	122160	know, it's a calcium, they have the different calcium since most of them are calcium. But it's
122160	128560	like, like, you can get it from having too little calcium or too much calcium. It's like, okay,
130080	136400	the whole amount of calcium. Exactly. How am I supposed to know? You know, how much calcium I
136400	142800	should have? And my wife always says that it's, you drink too much milk. I'm like, I hardly drink
142800	149040	any milk at all. I occasionally maybe once or twice a week, I have a bowl of cereal. And that's
149040	153920	it. Like that is hardly drinking too much milk. When I was a kid, I drank milk all the damn time.
153920	160480	So like, this is nothing. Like I, I don't know. It could be a lot of you're not a coffee person.
160480	166000	Like I drink like literally having iced coffee with it's not fat milk, but it's milk in it right
166000	173440	now. So yeah, I don't normally drink coffee. I have I've been, you know, drinking some more of
173440	179200	the Red Bulls recently. But not even that much like maybe once a week. And it's only because
179200	185760	I've had like a bag of these Red Bulls that I've had since last year sitting underneath my desk
185760	190720	here that I wanted to drink them before they expired. So I've been just going through those
190720	197760	slowly. But I've had like maybe five Red Bulls in the 2022 so far. So it's like, hardly nothing.
197760	202880	And she's like, Well, it's because you drink too much of those too. I honestly don't think so. I
202880	208720	mean, like one a day is not that bad. I wouldn't want it should not be a big deal. Let's talk video
208720	212960	games. What is that playing by? I think that I think I caught the title screen earlier. So playing
212960	218240	behind you because we are broadcasting live at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash a VOG network
218240	222880	where we do broadcast live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right
222880	227520	after the Bobby Black Wolf show and sometimes you get some we know it's a podcast we try to be very
227520	234160	aware and not rely too heavily on video. But I sometimes Loki will run video behind him actually
234160	239680	he always because we don't want to see my kitchen No, but um, you've got the Stanley parable, right?
239680	245680	But this is this the new one that like the or whatever, like the ultra deluxe 10 years later,
245680	251200	they've revisited it. That's pretty cool, though. Yeah, yeah, I like that. I get to play it. I need
251200	256080	to ask that if you played it yet, but you know, you're just watching YouTubers run through it.
256800	260240	Yeah, it's interesting how a lot of people will do games that way in this day and age, huh?
261040	267360	Well, I liked it. And I still will pick it up. I just haven't done it yet. I mean, I probably do
267360	273760	it now. I'm not joining us tonight. I need to mention dark soccer or Jamie Summers. You haven't
273760	278560	heard her yet because she's not here tonight. Usually I don't really get into the reasons like
278560	284560	if people take a night off or whatever, like I that's that's y'all's business. Unless you know,
284560	288320	people don't care and they want to they want to say what's going on. For example, Loki disclosed
288320	292400	his surgery on an earlier episode of the show. Dark soccer was very open about our trip to
292400	298320	Disneyland. And she has mentioned this on Twitter. And I think I think this is worth just talking
298320	302960	about and mentioning real quick. So I want to go to Twitter real quick here. The dark soccer put a
302960	306800	tweet up that said I'm not feeling very well tonight. So taking the night off olr and my
306800	311680	stream to rest and tend to my own mental health. Thank you all for understanding. And then some
311680	317840	nice words about Bobby and us. And you know, yeah, we don't, we don't often talk a lot about doing
317840	325040	stuff for your mental health. And, you know, especially when it comes to podcasting, streaming,
326080	332480	things of that sort. It can people oftentimes underestimate the toll that this type of stuff
332560	337520	can have on your mental health. Is that and that's why I've been like, personally,
337520	341520	even though I do streaming on the side, not just olr, but on my own personal channel,
341520	345920	I've sometimes personally resisted wanting to publish a schedule that like, I'm going to be
345920	351120	live on certain such and such day. And that's I realized like 95% of streamers do that. And that's
351120	358000	no shade or nothing. I'm just saying for me, like I, I have had all the time, these things where I'm
358000	362960	like, I'm going to stream tonight. And then when tonight comes around, I'm like, maybe I'm not,
362960	368800	cause I'm not really feeling extroverted tonight. I just kind of want to be a vegetable and play some
368800	373440	dead by daylight on my own terms. And that's going to be that. But then other times I'm like, yeah,
373440	376800	heck yeah, I'm going to get on stream and do that and do it. And I just kind of like to do that sort
376800	383680	of thing on my own schedule. So don't ever like force yourself or push yourself if you're not
383680	389120	like feeling it or whatever. If you like, if that sort of thing is going to be counterproductive to
389120	393920	your mental health, because we don't often talk about that type of stuff enough. And it's
393920	398480	important. You've got to take your time for your mental health and be in a good place like that,
398480	405200	or else you're just going to make the problem worse by, by doing podcasts, broadcasting,
405200	408960	twitching, whatever it is that's out there. And I see a lot of love in our chat room over
408960	415680	twitch.tv slash vog network. Pod culture saying a fucking man quest buster says streamers big
415680	420640	and small take breaks too, because human fifth dream says that is literally my entire life.
420640	425040	I never know from one minute to the next. If I feel like doing a thing physically or mentally
425040	430080	SSU 100, Matt says yourself is the most important thing. Take care of you first before worrying
430080	435520	about others needs. Very well said. Yeah, I can probably elaborate more. It's not even
435520	440720	just streamer stuff, but like YouTube in general to you can get burnt out creator culture. Yeah.
441440	447520	My gaming week, we'll talk about burnout. All right. The stuff that I did. Are you
447520	453760	have you finally had your fill of Minecraft? No, I haven't. I've had fill my fill of a certain
453760	462560	type of gameplay in Minecraft. Because I had a project this week that I built that was extremely
462560	468560	large. It took three weeks to put together. And I was just fed up with doing it. And it came out
468560	473360	really good. I saw the video because you posted it over in our Discord server, which you know,
473360	479040	of course, vog network.com slash discord. And if you aren't already subscribed to Loki on YouTube,
479040	485600	you should fix that. He's Loki o lr on YouTube. Very easy to find. And yeah, so I will get into
485600	490320	the video in a little bit in our gaming weeks that you don't eat of all your gaming week here. But
490320	494080	yeah, it looked very impressive what you were doing in that game. But you also have a lot of
494080	500640	patience to be doing something like that. That's for sure. But then I think he's been very bored
500640	507440	this last week. It wasn't boring at all. Because like I it was basically like, yeah,
507440	512960	the recovery from surgery is basically you couldn't, you couldn't really do like be active.
512960	518800	So I mean, I was on my computer, which is like, that's normal anyways. So it was,
519440	524400	it was instead of working at, you know, eight to five, or nine to five job or whatever.
526080	530640	I was doing Minecraft during that time. And during the time when I normally did so it's
530640	537600	like solid Minecraft, like, well, 14 hour days for like a week and a half just building one thing.
537600	542080	And that was just, I was getting tired by the end.
543760	548320	Bobby Black Wolf in chat, I want to go back to the topic we were just discussing discussing
548320	552240	about the mental health because there's more great comments in chat. And I want to read them.
552240	557280	Bobby Black Wolf says, especially since content creators are basically gig workers, and have to
557280	562880	pay for their own health insurance. So they feel like they can't take time off. There's no PTO for
562880	567840	a full time streamer. That's a huge point. We have a story coming up later on. And I'm sure many of
567840	573600	you have heard about this that's going on. And that is the talk about Twitch changing potentially
573600	578960	some of the rates and the payouts for partners to try to stay profitable. And, you know, that has
578960	585520	this huge impact. It's it's this incredibly uncharted territory, this whole making a living
585520	592560	off being a streamer. And it's, it's it's dangerous. It's risky. And that alone is a can
592560	598480	do a lot on mental health. Because as this news is showing this week, Twitch, Amazon can pull the rug
598480	604160	like that. And there isn't shit you can do about it, quite frankly. Unless Yeah, that's why folks
604160	609040	diversify. I mean, diversify your revenue streams, unless everybody, you know, groups up and does
609040	612960	something together. But yeah, yeah, diversify your revenue streams as very important. Yeah,
612960	616240	because like, even with YouTube, like you don't know, like, if there's gonna be another
616240	622320	apocalypse saying YouTube's algorithms and stuff, it's screwy. They could get content claimed for
622320	627040	nothing. Like it could be your own original content, but someone's trolling it or their
627040	631040	algorithm will decide one day they're going to delete your channel or who knows, like, so you
631040	639440	have to just do merchandise, Patreon, Twitch subscriptions, whatever you can do. Yeah, donations.
640400	644320	Yeah, you know, fog network, we're probably missing out not upping our YouTube presence. We
644320	648080	have a YouTube channel. And there's some good stuff on there. But we're not doing a lot of stuff
648080	654560	regularly. I have ideas. But you know, there's always ideas. There's just the time to put ideas
654560	659680	and emotion which isn't always plentiful. So anyway, I want to get some other comments here.
659680	663760	Pod culture says it's been a couple years and I'm just now feeling the itch to really start
663760	672240	podcasting again. It makes sense. Mike deaf says imposter syndrome is definitely not a joke. That
672240	679280	is so true. And I deal with that a lot a lot more than you guys probably think. From you know,
679280	683600	having listened to this show, as long as y'all have even if this is your first week, you know,
683600	687920	this show has been around for coming up on 20 years now. I deal with imposter syndrome all the
687920	693920	time. I deal with it in my professional life. I deal with it in what I do here. The first time I
693920	698720	did panels at Dragon Con, the first time I did a huge panel at Dragon Con, I dealt with it. I
698720	704160	dealt with it deal with it with a lot of the hosting that I do on the weekends. And some of
704160	710000	the big you know, I I've talked about some of the big names for me. Getting to host like doing the
710000	715120	Twin Peaks panel and stuff that was huge on imposter syndrome for me where I'm like,
715120	718560	there, you know, you're just you're going up there and it's like they're they're gonna know
718560	723600	that you're just a fan who rests the stage. You have no business being up here amongst all these
723600	730960	like actual talented people. And it's it's, it's a real thing. And that absolutely plays into Twitch
730960	738480	when sometimes people think nobody's gonna watch my stream, who cares about my stream and my thing.
738480	743600	And that's why I kind of like urge people. Don't. Nobody is going to watch your stream in the
743600	748560	beginning. Most likely you may have one or two people, your friends and stuff, but it takes a
748560	754800	long time and a lot of being regular and really immersing yourself in Twitch culture and networking
754800	761040	and making friends to grow on this platform. And it takes a long time and a lot of investment.
761040	766800	This isn't just something that happens overnight. And it's, it's a pretty big deal. And look,
766880	772160	I see you talking to chat about, you know, growing on YouTube and it's taken you a long time
772160	776160	just to grow a little bit. And you're still, are you at the monetized level yet?
776160	780320	No, not even close. You're still a lot bigger than you were two years ago.
781520	786240	Yes. And like two years ago, I think I was at a hundred and something. I think I can't remember
786240	793200	what I was like earlier this year, but I think it was like 200 something, like not that long ago.
793200	798640	And I'm up to 350. I've been getting, like, it said about 30 subscribers a month now,
799680	803920	which is pretty nice. It's because I'm kind of changing up my content a little bit and people
803920	807280	are starting to notice. And then you'd be surprised. There's a lot of people that don't
807280	811920	know like who you are, but then they'll find you like, how do you not have more subscribers
811920	815680	or like your content's really good. I don't understand comments on your YouTube. I've seen
815680	823360	them. Yeah. Yeah. It's just like, it's nice to hear honestly. Ironically, though, sometimes,
823360	828640	like the people that say that don't subscribe to your channel, they're like, I don't understand
828640	832480	how you have more subscribers, but that's also, it's hard to say too, because like,
832480	837600	I go to my like YouTube studio dashboard or whatever, and I can't always see who's
837600	842720	subscribing on my channel. I can only see if they share that or something, which is really stupid,
842720	846480	but like, I can't like, and I wish I could see who is subscribed, because then I would call them
846480	851280	out and like say, Hey, thank you, or do something to like, kind of promote that, but I can't,
851280	857120	I can only see if they share it. And so yeah, it's pretty nice. We also just got shouted out on
857120	864560	another like Minecraft kind of compilation channel as well. So that was thanks to my other creator
864560	870000	that's on our server that was sending them tips and stuff. So he got us notice. And that was kind
870000	875600	of nice. And then you know, there'll be the the new server that I'll be participating with later
875600	880960	this summer, which that should really help expand things as well. They're certainly more organized.
880960	887360	And we had a group meeting, they do they do monthly meetings, which is great. So we had a
887360	893360	meeting just yesterday, actually, and that was pretty cool to kind of get to talk to them a
893360	897680	little bit longer and stuff. So I'm hoping all that will help me grow. Really, I'm only trying
897680	902720	to get to right now is 500, which means I can use the community features, which includes like,
903280	908480	posting non video updates, and doing like community polls and stuff like that.
909120	915520	I don't know why the gate that behind 500. It's so stupid, but whatever, you know, it's fine.
915520	920320	We'll do that. And then yeah, someday I'll get to 1000. Then I'll get like, my pennies rolling in.
922320	925920	Getting some other comments in chat. Bobby Blackwell says it's a huge commitment to get
925920	929840	monetized on YouTube. Well, I'll tell you, it definitely doesn't get you monetized. It's doing
929840	937280	nothing, right? You gotta, you gotta try, try, try, try again. Let's see. Quest Buster says a
937280	941520	streamer I tuned into from time to time branch to YouTube, and I've been doing that for a few years
941520	945280	only recently near the beginning of the year, one of their videos finally popped off. And it just
945280	950000	led to more of their stuff being seen. And I think this is very important for us, Joe and under Matt,
950000	954720	who says, always remember, though, that always support folks who are struggling. Jamie is getting
954720	958720	a lot of support right now because we're an awesome community. True. Some streamers don't
958720	963840	always have a close knit community like that. Yes, we've had 2020 years to build this essentially.
963840	968880	Sometimes the hurt people feel isn't obvious. So the moral should always be be cool, be nice and
968880	973760	understanding with folks. You never know what the person is going through. Absolutely. Um,
975200	978880	there was a moment on this show, God, it was probably like 12 years ago at this point,
978880	983840	but every the folks that have been here a long time know this very well. And that was when I had
983840	988480	my diva fit live on air, right. And you definitely remember this Loki, it was when we were in the
988480	994400	garage when I was living with Johnny. And I somebody in like, everything was going wrong
994400	999440	with the show, there was a tech issue, something was going on. And somebody said something in chat.
999440	1004480	And I don't even at this point, I don't even exactly remember the comment. But it was something
1004480	1010240	about like, you know, just another thing breaking down or something like that. And even though the
1010240	1014480	person probably wasn't meaning to get out of my skin wasn't trying to get under my skin. Like,
1014480	1019680	I just snapped. And I was just like, well, then fuck it. And fuck this show, basically.
1019680	1026400	And I stormed off the set, literally stormed off the set. And Loki being the consummate professional
1026400	1033360	he is, was like, All right, well, let's go to the next story. And finally, this is student news.
1033360	1041280	I think he Yeah, exactly. And yeah, so you know what, it happens. You never know. And I'm not
1041280	1044880	saying you know, and again, I don't blame that individual. I don't even think this is the show
1044880	1050400	anymore. But even if they did, I don't blame that individual. It just sometimes these things happen.
1050400	1054800	And sometimes the chat comments and stuff, you never know what impact they're going to have.
1054800	1058320	And yeah, Matt says there was actually something more recently, of course, just a few weeks ago,
1058320	1062240	when you stopped the show, Rob, I saw you were done. And I saw you just needed to stop for
1062240	1067600	yourself. Yes, when the tech issues were like, literally mentally. So for the podcast, folks,
1067600	1072080	you didn't see any of this, because I just didn't put out a show that week. But the live folks here
1072080	1076480	on Twitch, we started to do a show. And there wasn't usually even if there's only a partial
1076480	1081840	show, I'll put it out on the feed anyway. But we really only did like 20 minutes. And the tech
1081840	1089360	issues were just too overwhelming. And I got to a point where I was like, I'm I'm not dealing with
1089360	1094800	these tech issues anymore. I'm done. And of course, you know what, given give it seven days,
1094800	1100560	turn it off, and then on again, everything worked magically the next week. And now my phone speaking
1100560	1105440	of tech issues, my phone thinks I'm yelling at it. But anyway, yeah, I mean, it just sometimes
1105440	1109920	you just have to step away. And that's exactly what that moment was, was just a whole, I'm
1109920	1116640	overwhelmed. This is too much. If I don't step away, I'm gonna have another fit. So this time,
1116640	1125760	I knew to stop it anyway. All right. Plenty plenty of meta stuff. Let's get into some news
1125760	1130480	for the week going around in the gaming world. We're gonna start off tonight with this story,
1130480	1136080	which is, this is something else. You know, I think a lot of people heard the story of Balan
1136080	1140960	Wonderland, or maybe you pre ordered it and you actually bought it and you played it. And maybe
1140960	1146000	you still enjoyed it. I realized this game has its fans and its apologizers. And that's fine. You
1146480	1152400	like what you like and go off. But I think we can all kind of see that the community as a whole
1153440	1158400	rejected this game. It didn't sell as much as it should have, considering it was by the creator
1158400	1162480	of Sonic and for a Square Enix game. And for the most part, it flopped. And people just kind of
1162480	1168320	wrote it off as, well, man, Yuji Naka, I guess just couldn't make another good game. That's
1168320	1172800	too bad. You know, we've all written it off. But now there's a very interesting layer,
1173760	1177920	layer, la y er, there's another whole new interesting layer that's shown up with this.
1178960	1182800	Interesting to that actually, now I just stopped me to think this is very interesting coming after
1182800	1189120	that whole discussion on assuming what a streamer is going through. Well, how about a game developer?
1189680	1197600	Because yeah, this is very interesting. So Yuji Naka went to Twitter to vent about what happened
1197600	1203920	with Balamb Wonderworld. He said he was removed as the game's director six months before launch,
1203920	1209280	and the developer Arzest submitted a final build of the game that wasn't final and it had bugs in
1209280	1214640	it. Yuji Naka also on Twitter claimed that one of the songs in the game was going to be reworked
1214640	1220320	for promotional purposes, and not using the track that was straight from the game. Yuji Naka said
1220320	1224960	that game creators should be able to improve their games until the very end, when he requests to
1224960	1229360	address issues, and when his requests to address these issues were ignored, he decided to sue
1229360	1235040	Square Enix. Yuji Naka says if he was kept on as the head of the project, it would have never
1235040	1240160	released in an unfinished state, and he found that seeing Balamb Wonderworld release in an
1240160	1246560	unfinished state was a true disgrace. There's a lot of comments that are on Twitter. It's a
1246560	1253280	little much for me to read, but let me try to get some highlights here. He talked about Sonic.
1253280	1258800	For example, in Sonic the Hedgehog, two weeks before going gold, we changed the mechanics,
1258800	1264880	where if you had even a single ring, you would not die. Even up until the very end, we were trying to
1264880	1268480	improve the game, and I hope that everyone is still enjoying those games today, and I think
1268480	1276640	everybody knows that mechanic in Sonic the Hedgehog, and that's important, right? He also
1276640	1282080	says the business relationship with Arzest fell apart due to my comments about Arzest submitting
1282080	1287040	the final build without fixing bugs, even though there were problems during development, and I was
1287040	1292960	pushing for further polish. Oshima spoke to the producer Fujimoto about this. Oshima wrote in an
1292960	1297840	emailed Fujimoto saying, I gathered the development staff and informed them about pushing back the
1297840	1303120	trial phase of development. This decision was made by producer Fujimoto. Let's do our best for Mr.
1303120	1308480	Fujimoto. The staff applauded and cheered. This was wholly unexpected, and we were very touched.
1308480	1312880	The staff who had recently been rather dejected were in an instant revitalized. Thank you very
1312880	1317440	much. The entire staff will do our best. Yujinaka said, I don't have anything to do with the
1317440	1321520	development timeline because that is created by the producer, not me, the director. Such tight
1321520	1327440	deadlines are decided by the producer. Something didn't seem quite right. Personally, I believe
1327440	1332480	that it is a true disgrace that Balowonder World was released in the state that it was in.
1332480	1337360	I wanted to show the world an action game in its proper light. Therefore, I believe that Square
1337360	1345440	Enix and RZest are companies that care about neither games nor their fans. Yep. That's a huge
1345440	1351760	dagger to throw at Square Enix, which is, you know, with especially such a large company where,
1351760	1358320	you know, this is the same company that has huge fans and people that feel much differently when
1358320	1362880	it comes to things like Final Fantasy 14, or I suppose the Final Fantasy series in general.
1363600	1367920	Um, what are your thoughts hearing all this, Loki? What did you think when you heard about this?
1367920	1374160	It's unfortunate because like I kind of, I did kind of blame Yujinaka for like how bad this
1374160	1379200	turned out originally because you kind of look at it like almost like a Mighty No. 9 type of
1379200	1383760	scenario where it's like, oh, you know, you think you're going to, you know, make this great Megaman
1383760	1387200	clone or something like that. And it ends up turning out to be garbage. And it's like, well,
1387200	1391200	maybe you just couldn't do that. And it's like, oh, maybe this is another Mighty No. 9 again.
1391200	1395200	But we got to remember now that there's also publishers that make really dumb decisions
1395200	1401600	constantly. Right. And Square Enix is one to do that, to cut corners to, you know,
1401600	1406320	on some other products like Final Fantasy 14, it's very well put together and stuff. But
1406320	1412880	I think there's different projects have different levels of upper management kind of oversight on,
1412880	1418160	whereas like, you know, some of these remasters of the older Final Fantasy games that kind of
1418160	1423760	get kind of rushed out and look kind of like garbage. And there's like weird bugs and stuff
1423760	1429280	in them. Like, I think that kind of stuff is kind of, you know, what's the blame here? I wouldn't be
1429280	1435760	surprised if Arzest got like some sort or maybe management, Arzest got some sort of bonus for
1435760	1440800	being able to publish the game when they could. So they'd rather release it with bugs, get that
1440800	1448560	kickback rather than put out a good product. Who knows? Some comments from chat. E3VL says,
1448560	1454080	worst game of last year for me. Mike Def says, I think Naka is in the right, but also the game was
1454080	1459520	beyond saving from its development history. Sacred Jade says, I believe Naka-san, Square Enix hasn't
1459520	1464400	been the best in the last few years. Questbuster says, I agree. The game was in development since
1464400	1469680	2018 and a lot of core mechanics have had to have been baked in by the time he was dismissed
1469680	1474160	that the rest of the game had to be built around. Six months isn't really a lot of time to put in
1474160	1481520	heavy redesign. Yeah. And here's the thing. If he was the producer, though, or, you know, whoever
1481520	1486400	that was, you know, approving timelines and stuff, you know, maybe if he thought he couldn't get it
1486400	1491200	done in time, then they would push it back. I mean, I don't know. Well, and that's, and that's
1491200	1496560	the thing. I do think this story is fascinating. And I do think, you know, it should make us all
1496560	1502080	think differently about how did a flop become a flop? Did these people set out to make a flop?
1502080	1510160	No. But did all of their visions on how to get it done get aligned? Clearly not. But, and so I think
1510160	1514560	there's definitely something to be said here about maybe how fast some of us were to, you know, kind
1514560	1519280	of say, oh, Yuji Naka made a flop when maybe he really was behind the scenes trying to push back
1519280	1525280	on some of that. However, all that being said, I will say, I think Yuji Naka did make a key mistake,
1525280	1530400	a critical mistake. And it's that part in his thing where he talks about the Sonic the hedgehog
1530400	1536480	and changing that up to, you know, two weeks before the game was released. Sir, you're not
1536480	1541600	making games to the Sega Genesis anymore. Games don't work the same way that they did
1542880	1549040	literally 30 years ago at this point. And so, you know, if you want to go all the way back to the
1549040	1557680	days of the Atari 2600, those games were made by one person. And then when you get into the NES
1557680	1562640	era, some of the hell some of those games were made by one person. Like you look at balloon fight,
1562640	1567520	you know, as you know, Satoru Iwata is, you know, one of his, you know, biggest, well known games,
1568080	1571760	or small teams, if you will, when you get in the NES era, and then getting into the Sega Genesis
1571760	1576240	still, it was more smaller teams. That's not how games are made anymore. Not a Square Enix
1576240	1581200	production, right? But like, it's not necessarily I mean, it's still I think, a good example,
1581200	1585520	though, like just changing game mechanics, but should you really be changing game mechanics two
1585520	1591600	weeks, you know, right from launch? I mean, I get it. Like, I don't know what he's changing it from,
1591600	1595520	like, if there's like, oh, you have to have 50 rings in or not to die or something like that.
1595520	1598720	I don't know what it was before where they decided to drop it down. But that's,
1598720	1603440	that's like tweaking a value. It's like, okay, well, this boss is going to do 10 damage points
1603440	1606800	instead of two damage points or something like that. Like that's just like small tweaks. That's
1606800	1612160	what that's what you do. Like in the part of the whole gameplay testing and balancing phase of
1612160	1617360	like game development. It doesn't matter the size of the team. But that, right. That's just an
1617360	1622320	example of like, we constantly work towards making the game better up until launch, right? That that's
1622320	1626880	what development teams are supposed to do. You don't just go, okay, time to kick back. You know,
1626880	1631600	it's like, right, you're trying to smash, you know, bugs and stuff like that. But like,
1631600	1636560	but certain things sounded like there's a lot six months beforehand. They weren't. That's why,
1636560	1641920	you know, ultimate. So again, this is, I think mistakes were made all around. I don't think
1641920	1645920	Square Enix Square Enix is certainly not blameless in this scenario. No, I'm not sure
1645920	1654000	Yuji Naka is 100% the good guy. I think he made mistakes too. And the one thing, you know, I'm not
1654000	1659360	seeing a lot of that in here. And this discussion for the lawsuit is, you know, what, what did he
1659360	1664480	learn about himself from this experience? So that's just, that's just something I just kind
1664480	1672560	of notice. So anyway, I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network as the two 100 Matt
1672560	1677600	says, seems like there were F your visions. We got to get this game out now because we're invested
1677600	1683360	too much and need to get a return here. As to 100 Matt says six weeks out, your QA testing should be
1683360	1689440	done not changing mechanics. Last week, we talked about Xenoblade Chronicles three and how it's
1689440	1696080	coming out early now. You know how a game comes out early? A lot of planning and getting a lot of
1696080	1705280	shit locked in well before two weeks before or just releasing it early and hoping for the best
1705280	1709680	and then putting out a roadmap later on seeing that like, here's how we're going to fix it.
1710320	1716640	Here's our roadmap and our roadmap of a roadmap. Yeah, so there's two options there. The good and
1716640	1717200	the evil.
1718320	1723200	questbuster says huge respect for Naka and his place in gaming history. No one will take that
1723200	1728320	away. Yes, I agree. But he's still human like everyone else. Absolutely. Right? Exactly.
1729760	1734080	As like, you know, for example, Mighty number nine, you know, that that's another perfect
1734080	1740160	example. Like it on paper, that should have been a really fun like Mega Man type game.
1740960	1747520	It wasn't. On the other hand, then we also have was that that bloodstain rituals of the night or
1747520	1755200	whatever. Whereas that is a good like Castlevania like game. So some people can do it. Some people
1755200	1762720	try to do it and they it you know, they can't. It's not as easy as you know, just being a certain
1762720	1767760	role on a team. You know, it's you're running this company and doing all this other stuff like,
1767760	1771280	like my number nine had a lot of stuff that was like wrong with it. Like,
1772000	1776800	when they are start pitching a whole nother game on top of it, like a new Mega Man Legends type
1776800	1782720	thing. And like animated series and all this stuff. It's like, okay, cool. Let's focus back
1782720	1786880	on that game that you need to work on, you know, not just all these other projects down the road
1786880	1792800	like it. Yeah, it's just you have to have the right talents to be able to do just the game
1792800	1798400	development part and then all the other publishing and stuff parts as well. Because if you don't,
1798400	1800960	then it'll fall apart even if you are a talented developer.
1801760	1806480	I'm hoping I'm pronouncing this right. I'm sorry if I'm not in chat. Godets in chat says it's
1806480	1810240	interesting. I've played a lot of teamfight tactics and League of Legends over the years.
1810240	1814800	So I'm pretty used to constant changes to my game. But those are free to play models. Yeah,
1814800	1819520	exactly. It's not something where, you know, they're taking pre orders, getting your money up
1819520	1824080	front, you know, to deliver a game on a certain date. I think usually the vision of those free
1824080	1830560	to play games is usually it's it's that, you know, they're going to grow their subscribers over time.
1830560	1836240	That's what success looks like to a free to play game. It is very rare. You have a game like
1836240	1842480	Pokemon Go, that has gazillions of players out the gate. That's not the model of success. And
1842480	1847280	that's not even when this has been discussed many times. That's not what Niantic was expecting
1847280	1852960	either. Is that game be huge at the gate. It's all about growing your base with those games.
1852960	1859920	It is a much different model to approach anyway. But yeah, Yuji Naka, he's human. It'll be
1859920	1863760	interesting to see how this plays out in the coming months. But it definitely puts a whole
1863760	1869200	other spin on this conversation. Anyway, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the
1869200	1872960	types of video games that we have been playing this week. Loki, you were talking a little bit
1872960	1878960	about it. But how was your recovery gaming week? My gaming week was all Minecraft because I had a
1878960	1886480	large project that I decided to do. So in my S&P series on nerdcraft, I've been working on this
1886480	1893200	whole steampunk, you know, build. And so part of that is going to be building a city, you know,
1893200	1899040	a steampunk city or something. So I was trying to terraform everything to make the land kind of,
1899040	1904880	usable to build buildings on it. And I realized it was just really flat and boring. And so like
1904880	1910160	my other folks, since we have it like broken up with different factions, so they have like the
1910160	1917040	folks that are building mountains, and one doing like gothic architecture. And then I think
1917040	1921680	somebody else was doing something. But the mountain stuff looked really cool. And I was like,
1921680	1927680	well, it'd be cool to build like a mountain. And then my project got over scoped to hell. So like,
1927680	1934240	it took forever to clear out the land that was in there. Then I ended up going into a creative test
1934240	1941680	world, designing a mountain, basing it off of like some of the block pallets and stuff in this mod
1941680	1947680	Terralith, which has these really, Terralith is awesome. It has like a really beautiful landscape
1947680	1954960	and everything in all these different mountains and just amazing landscapes. So I based it off
1954960	1960000	of that. And then I decided because I'm a perfectionist, I need to put real Minecraft
1961520	1968080	caves inside these mountains. So I also grabbed some of those out of my world and kind of
1968720	1973760	build the schematics around all that stuff. So after I had all that done, and then I because
1973760	1978720	originally the schematic was like 4 million blocks, I was like, nope, not doing that because
1978720	1985200	it was solid. So I hollowed it out, which took forever. And then once I had it all hollowed out,
1985200	1991360	it had the schematic in place, I needed to gather about 90,000 blocks to start building. And that's
1991360	1999040	90,000 outside of like the actual smoothing of the landscape to match the land around it. So
1999040	2004480	the landscape smoothing itself also took about another, I think it was like 120,000. I don't
2004480	2011520	know, it ended up being roughly just over 200,000 blocks at the place or remove or it was a lot. So
2013280	2018000	that took several weeks just to design it. And then once I got it took like a week or something
2018000	2024720	to clear out the space, and then to actually build everything took like a week and a half to two
2024720	2029520	weeks. And when I say a week and a half to two weeks, I'm not talking about like, after work each
2029520	2037280	day, it was during my recovery time, I was putting in 12 to 14 hour days playing Minecraft,
2037280	2044160	doing this stuff. So it's it was a massive project, like massive, massive project.
2044960	2049040	So I'm showing the video for the Twitch people. And for the folks on the podcast, of course,
2049040	2052640	you can see it too. And I would urge you to go check it out over at Loki o lr on YouTube.
2052640	2057120	But this this mountain, we're looking at a Minecraft, you built that? Yep, one brick
2057120	2066560	at a time. Yep, one one block at a time. It's hollow. So it's, it's, it, it, you know, it's
2066560	2072480	a lot less material. So yeah, but yeah, the time lapse on that video is great. I the music and
2072480	2076560	everything. It turned out really well. But yeah, there's actual keys in there. In fact, I think I
2076560	2081440	actually a little bit later in the clip here, I end up like going into one of the caves that kind
2081440	2089360	of show it off. But yeah, we can just yeah, it's there you are in the cave. Yeah, there's one of
2089360	2094320	the caves that I was in. So like it actually has caves and I lit up everything so that mobs will
2094320	2101840	spawn in there. But yeah, that was like when I watch your videos, I'm so inspired to play
2101840	2108000	Minecraft. And then I do play Minecraft. And then I remember how fucking bad I am at it that like,
2108000	2110240	I need to not play survival mode. That's the thing.
2111120	2115840	Play survival. There's a lot of stuff that they've changed nowadays. It makes it a lot easier
2115840	2121520	like lighting up stuff. Like monsters don't come out unless there's light level zero. So you can
2121520	2125760	put fewer torches and stuff. Here's what I didn't finish the story. Here's what really happens Loki
2125760	2129120	and they'll start playing Minecraft. I'm like, this is too hard. And I'll be like, I'll go play
2129120	2134720	No Man's Sky because that's like Minecraft enough. Yeah, that's that's what ends up happening.
2135680	2140800	Anyway, check out check out that video over at YouTube Loki o lr. Of course,
2140800	2143760	so I don't want to show the whole thing. But I had to share. That's fine.
2145200	2150640	But yeah, it's so it was a massive project. And it was my fault for making it too because like,
2150640	2155200	I started off in the mountain wasn't that big. And I was like, it doesn't look that great.
2156720	2160960	And so it just kept getting bigger. And then it kept getting more elaborate. And it was just
2161920	2168080	what I should have done is broke it up for multiple videos. But I just didn't,
2168080	2173920	I just wanted to finish it. And so I did it on one and it's really way too much for one video.
2173920	2178880	It was and then fortunately, like I looked at the time like the last video I'd released before that
2178880	2184720	was my April Fool's video, which was on April 9. And this is like almost three weeks later. So it
2184720	2191520	I try not to space that out that much because I want to make sure that I have, you know,
2191520	2196640	my content in there. I try to get stuff out at least every week or two weeks. I did put a
2196640	2203600	hardcore one in between those but it's just you know, it turned out really well. Now I can just
2203600	2210000	go focus on buildings and stuff and not actually doing more landscape stuff. I'll do some landscape
2210000	2216880	stuff, but it's gonna be a lot less big like this. But it just, yeah, it turned out really
2216880	2222560	well. So hopefully it gets noticed. Because, yeah, it took a lot of time.
2224720	2230160	My gaming week, a lot of the same stuff for me as well. A lot of Final Fantasy 14,
2230160	2234880	I was streaming that I've been leveling Sage in that game. So I'm, I think I've got Sage up to
2234880	2240480	85 or 86 now. So I'm getting really close to 90. And yeah, so I did a couple of streams.
2241360	2245120	Shane was on there and we were running dungeons talking about random stuff. I'm very thankful.
2245840	2250000	Shane will stream with me. So I have someone to talk to because then that way it doesn't matter
2250000	2253680	if like no one's watching, we're able to have a conversation. It's really nice. So that's been
2253680	2262800	fun to stream. Also been playing. I think I sometimes understate how much I play some of the
2262800	2269280	mobile games like Pikmin, which, I mean, Pikmin is really like a set it and forget it kind of game
2270320	2275600	when you're like planting flowers and stuff. But those games really do incentivize the walking
2275600	2280320	that I do and the exercise that I've been getting. And I've been very transparent here on this show
2280320	2286720	that I made a lot of changes with a lot of my lifestyle stuff about six months ago. And today
2286720	2294560	I hit a landmark of 45 pounds lost since last summer, basically. And a lot of that is
2295360	2302640	gamification of walking through things like Pokemon Go, Ingress somewhat. And Pikmin has
2302640	2307120	been huge with it because Pikmin Bloom came out right around the time all that started happening.
2307120	2312240	So it's been hugely like motivational for that stuff. So if it seems like I'm always talking
2312240	2316560	about the same games. I also sometimes don't talk enough about some of them that I really I
2316560	2322160	do put a lot in because it it incentivizes the real world moving around stuff that I need to be
2322160	2330240	really doing a lot right now. So I just hit level 55 or am I 56? I'm somewhere in there in Pikmin.
2330240	2334720	So I'm getting pretty pretty. I'm at the point where my level is in silver, it changes to silver
2334720	2341040	at 50. So I know the level cap is 100. So someday, I'll get there. I'll try and keep trying.
2342960	2346720	Otherwise, I actually I actually played a little bit of Dead by Daylight today,
2346720	2350480	which I haven't been playing as much of that lately. But they're doing an event this weekend,
2350480	2355360	they just launched a new rift. I don't think it's our show notes tonight. So they made a big deal
2355360	2362880	that they they have announced that one of their characters is gay. And as part of the you know,
2362880	2370160	they know they know that the LGBTQIA plus community keeps them afloat on Twitch. And so
2370240	2373680	it's one of those things where they knew they needed the representation of the game. So they
2373680	2382240	did it. Um, a lot of different hot takes on it. Some folks feel that, you know, this character
2382240	2387040	has been out for six years. And it said, does it seem like it's a little bit pandering? Like,
2387040	2392080	I get it. Like, it's good to have representation. But it's also like, kind of pandering. Yeah,
2392080	2396560	yeah, both those things can be true, is that it's nice to have representation. But it does
2396560	2401200	feel a little bit like pandering. Now, at least I'll say this, it's not June. So at least they're
2401200	2406320	doing it outside of Pride Month. And they released a really nice new pride charm, they they have the
2406320	2413200	new progress pride flag is available in game to redeem to which is nice. You know, and again,
2413200	2415840	it's one of those things where it's like, well, I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth.
2415840	2421760	I'm glad the representation is there. That's cool. But does it feel a little bit like,
2422000	2427120	gosh, a lot of players are leaving our game. I hope the gays don't leave us. We better throw
2427120	2432160	them a gay character. And you know what, let's make the most conventionally stereotypically
2432160	2437520	hot one, the gay one, the shirtless one, the gay one. And sure enough, that's what we got.
2437520	2443760	And so there's a little bit of, I don't know, there's just a little bit of, hmm, hmm. But
2444320	2449840	but I'm not complaining. But it's also just dead by daylight. It's whatever.
2451680	2455440	But I want to make clear, that's not the reason why I started playing again. I mean, it's neat.
2455440	2459840	And I did log in to get the new pride flag. That was more of a big deal than the character to be
2459840	2463280	quite honest, because I don't care about lore. Dark soccer, she cares about lore. Maybe she
2463280	2466640	has more of an opinion on that. We can ask her next week. But I don't really care about lore.
2466640	2474000	I just care about the game. So anyway, but they have the double rift tokens going on right now.
2474000	2477440	And you know, that means you can earn cosmetic rewards, which is kind of fun. So I've been
2477440	2483840	playing a little bit of that. So all right, let's move on and get into some other gaming news for
2483840	2490720	the week. And Loki is going to start us off tonight, talking about, you know, some schedules,
2490720	2495600	some schedule not changes, some things, some things just stay the same, I guess.
2495600	2498400	Some things just, you know, some things the venue was already rented.
2499200	2507120	Right. So Microsoft in well, Bethesda, and now Microsoft are going to be continuing
2507120	2514800	the tradition of having a presentation that interrupts our show on June 12. So they're
2514800	2522080	going to be doing the Microsoft and Bethesda not E3 showcase that will show off what's going to be
2522080	2530640	coming up on their Xbox and PC and game pass ecosystems. Cool. I'm excited.
2530640	2535040	Yeah, it's it's actually even though there is no E3 this year.
2535680	2540480	It's actually at 10am. Oh, my mistake. Yeah, it won't interrupt our show this time.
2540480	2545680	But it's it's nice that they're keeping some of the pomp and circumstance that gamers come to
2545680	2550720	expect from June. So it's nice to see that Microsoft slash Bethesda is kind of holding
2550720	2555360	down the fort, so to speak. And now that it's both those companies at the same time, because
2555360	2559920	I don't, you know, with the pandemic and everything, we haven't really had a traditional
2559920	2565840	event in a while. So it'll be kind of neat to see Microsoft and Bethesda sort of joining forces
2565840	2569440	for this this year in a little, which I would assume is going to be a little more
2570320	2576400	feel a little more traditional, maybe. So yeah, and I would bet that they booked the venue
2577280	2583360	a year ago. Probably probably before there wasn't going to be an E3.
2585120	2591600	Anyway, do I dare ask or is it just stupid to ask? What do you think they're going to show?
2592400	2597840	What do you think we're going to get? I mean, Starfield, Fable, probably more content for
2597840	2605120	Halo Infinite. I don't know. Microsoft has so many studios now. I mean, there could be a plethora of
2605120	2610960	things that they could show. Yeah, I think start a Starfield with the game. We know Starfield's
2610960	2616320	coming out in November, unless they push it back, which they could always do. But I think they will,
2616320	2621680	you know, Bethesda is not afraid to release a game with bugs. So Starfield will probably still come
2621680	2626240	out in November. So I would fully expect we're going to get a deep dive in Starfield in June.
2627040	2632400	I am pretty hyped about that. I like space. So I'm curious, you know how that game is going to look
2632400	2639360	and play. I'm hoping it's Elder Scrolls in space. I really am. So we'll see. Speaking of Elder
2639360	2645520	Scrolls, I'm not expecting that we see Elder Scrolls 6, but I'd be really excited if we got
2645520	2650000	a little more than what we've had so far, like another teaser. You know, I think because Starfield
2650000	2655280	is this year, it would be silly to expect Elder Scrolls 6 is also this year. I think that game is
2655280	2662320	probably still two years away, but I would be excited for new Fallout, not 76. Although we
2662320	2668560	probably will get some Fallout 76 content that they'll probably show off. But another huge thing
2668560	2672240	I want to see, and I'm so excited about it because I do think it'll be, I think this is going to be
2672240	2679680	a this year release, the Fable game from, you know, the Forza Horizon team. I am fucking excited
2679680	2683040	about that. And I'm thinking June is when we're going to get to see some actual footage. There
2683040	2689280	better be some really awesome, like some really awesome wagon racing in that game.
2692880	2695040	Now you want them to make an Oregon Trail game.
2696320	2699360	Where you can, you can race the Oregon Trail and for the
2699360	2708160	I want it like Oregon Trail, but literally with the horizon. The horizon, not horizon, with the
2710160	2715600	yeah, like with with the the modern Racing D aesthetic to it, like, you know, this Oregon Trail,
2715600	2720080	I want the same radio stations in there, even though it's completely unrealistic, like I just
2720080	2727200	want it. Absolutely. Just that. Okay. Modern Oregon, Oregon Trail. I'm down. I'm down. I
2727200	2734560	think that's exciting. All right. Let's see. I guess we should move on to our next story.
2736160	2741120	Which of course, bear with me a little bit here. All right. So let's talk a little bit about
2741120	2749440	PlayStation Plus, because we're gonna get the new PlayStation Plus and the, you know, the new
2749440	2753200	cloud stuff. Well, it's not really new, but there's a whole bunch of new stuff getting
2753200	2759200	added to it. We're getting that later in June, which by the way, have we had Sony confirm that
2759200	2763440	they are planning something for June? We haven't had them confirmed yet, right?
2763440	2770160	Think so. They do their own thing. But I mean, all of these changes are supposed to happen what
2770160	2776080	like around like June 13, or something, which is very conveniently timed right around that,
2776080	2781200	right? Or not E3. June 13 is when it's supposed to launch in the US. So I mean,
2782080	2786720	it's very conveniently timed to have an unveil of what all is going to be in that. But anyway,
2787520	2794800	anyway. However, even though this is Sony's answer to Game Pass, in some ways, it's not going to fall
2794800	2799680	for the same stuff that Game Pass fell for. Meaning, if you're trying to stack up your
2799680	2805600	subscription to get many free years of the ultimate PlayStation Plus, tough cookie,
2805600	2812800	you cannot do it. It's already been shut down. Sony has temporarily disabled the ability to stack
2812800	2817920	PlayStation Plus subscription time ahead of these new changes that are coming in June.
2818560	2823840	The company will take the longest running active subscription when setting the converted memberships
2823840	2828720	end date. So basically, you could stock up on regular Plus cards to get the same time as a
2828720	2833840	premium subscriber you could have before, but you can't do that anymore. And more information has
2833840	2839600	come out since then about exactly how many days things will convert to. So it's like if you have
2839600	2844160	like a PlayStation now it only converts like 18 years later. So anyway, if you didn't get in on
2844160	2850160	this early, it's already been shut down. So yep, cool. Glad they're doing everything they can to
2850160	2855520	make it not a good deal. Orange writing chat says my current subscription lasts until March 2024.
2855520	2860320	Well, lucky you, lucky you because you get got in on that before they changed everything. So
2861760	2867760	yeah, I'm curious what the new PlayStation Plus is going to look like with all the retro games. But
2867760	2871120	you know, it just kind of depends on what's in there, I think a little bit.
2871120	2878080	So but we're starting to get our first glance at what might be in there. Because
2879120	2884080	apparently some of the games that are going to be on the premium PlayStation Plus,
2884080	2891680	they're starting to leak onto the PlayStation Network. Users on Reddit found new listings for
2891680	2897280	classic titles with new thumbnail art. And apparently they're starting to show up within
2897280	2903440	that PSN backend. So these would be games that are very likely for PlayStation Plus. So games
2903440	2911120	that have been discovered so far Tekken 2 from Namco, Mr. Driller, and Ridge Racer for the PSP
2912000	2917840	all have been spotted on there. But that's it. So that's only three games out of what like 450
2917840	2924640	that we know of so far. But I mean, I'm excited to see Ridge Racer coming back. I wish it was a new
2924640	2931040	Ridge Racer. But I also mentioned Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party as well. Yes, those got
2931040	2936160	spotted later. So a few days later, they found Yeah, those two games as well. So but we don't
2936160	2942400	have any official confirmation from Sony as of yet. Orange Wright says cool to see PSP games.
2942400	2947600	Yes, we actually we did know that PSP games were coming out as part of this too. What we don't know
2947600	2952480	yet PlayStation Vita, they never did confirm that. So I wouldn't expect PlayStation Vita.
2953280	2957280	And that might have to do with the backtouch panel maybe making a lot of games. But there's
2957280	2962560	a lot on the Vita that wouldn't need that you would think I don't know. Well, they did put out
2962560	2973520	a console called the PlayStation TV that doesn't have a back panel. So I guess. All right. Well,
2973520	2981280	let's move on. More updates in Sony's world sort of right. Yep. So apparently, there's rumors
2982080	2986880	that Final Fantasy 16 is near the end of development, according to the producer.
2987200	2997040	Um, so I guess we'll be seeing this soon. Maybe if it's something in June, I think it's about time
2997040	3004320	we're gonna see some more, you know, the last the last 10% is also the last 90%. So it could be wild,
3004320	3012480	you know? So we'll see. But yeah, Final Fantasy 16. Well, something to consider to when that game
3012480	3018400	was first unveiled, what about a year ago at this point, right? When that game was first unveiled,
3018400	3022640	it was really far along like just in what you were seeing in the trailer and all that stuff. I mean,
3022640	3028400	they were running it on a PC emulating PlayStation. But I mean, still, like just with the cutscenes
3028400	3033120	you were seeing, they showed in game combat footage and stuff like that. So like, the game
3033120	3038800	did seem like it was pretty far along at that point last year than it has been the most games
3038800	3044160	are when they announce them. So, you know, but again, obviously, I want the game to be good.
3044160	3050640	I so I want them to take their time and just get it right. But you know, again, with Yoshida
3050640	3055120	producing it, who has basically saved the Final Fantasy franchise with Final Fantasy 14, in my
3055120	3062640	opinion, I, I have big expectations for this game, which is probably a dangerous thing. But I really,
3062720	3070240	I really, really can't wait for it. So like, I hope it's this holiday. But I will wait longer
3070240	3074320	if I need to for the game to be right, I guess is what I'm trying to say. I need to go back and
3074320	3079440	finish the Final Fantasy seven remake and stuff and 15. It's pretty good. Seven is pretty good.
3079440	3087120	15 is okay. 15 is worth your time. But I did find the last sequence to be a bit of a letdown,
3087120	3091120	although it did have a good ending. I will say the ending scene was more satisfying than most.
3091760	3096480	I'm so just, I don't even want to call it old school. I'm just old at this point. But like,
3097360	3104320	I missed the term Bates Final Fantasy games. Like, that's what it was. This is this fast
3104320	3110560	actions too fast for my feeble elderly hands. According to the internet, you know,
3110560	3115120	because like, elderly is 25 now. So get good. I don't really know what that's. I don't really
3115200	3121680	look at me. But like, get good. I guess like, I don't know, like, I just want to like,
3121680	3126160	I just want to relax and be able to strategize on like, what I need to do and not like have to
3127040	3131600	do all that. I don't know. Remember, Final Fantasy 15 did have two modes. It had the
3131600	3137440	normal weight mode or whatever. I know it did. And I played the demo and the demo was
3138160	3145200	fine, I guess. But like, it's just not the same. You know, like, I like I miss, like, honestly,
3145200	3149760	when we were looking at Final Fantasy games, like how they kind of work. Like Lost Odyssey was a
3149760	3155680	great Final Fantasy game like that. That's how it should be like, modern, modern game with like,
3155680	3160160	the Final Fantasy combat. I mean, that's kind of what it is. Well, some would argue go play
3160160	3169280	Octopath Traveler. That's what Square Enix is doing now. Yeah, I guess. I don't know.
3169280	3173360	I have a live coming out soon. I'm just I'm just stubborn. I guess I don't know. I just need to
3173360	3177120	give it another chance. That's like why I haven't really played like Kingdom Hearts either. Because
3177120	3183040	like, oh, yeah, I still buy them for some stupid reason. But like, I haven't played the kids.
3183840	3188480	The kids don't play those games. Some day. They don't play those games. Like, yeah, sure.
3190720	3197840	Yeah, so like, I help you. And now you are like, um, yeah, I don't know. I want to enjoy those
3197840	3201680	games. But they're so convoluted. Like Final Fantasy 15. Like kind of bored me. Like,
3201680	3206480	I couldn't really follow the storyline. It was just, I don't know. I didn't give it much of a
3206480	3211440	chance. But I'll go back to it at some point. I don't know. Bobby Blackwolf and chat says
3211440	3217360	persona is a great turn based JRPG. But it's a time commitment. Bobby, Bobby, Bobby. I'm so
3217360	3223520	disappointed. That was the perfect opportunity for you to say your kooza like a dragon is a
3223520	3229920	great JRPG. And it is that is a great way to play it again. And you that is like opportunity you
3229920	3237040	know, you windows close now that you you are correct. That is a great RPG. And I do love
3237040	3242960	that game. And that is a game I do need to go back and finish. I just need to get my Xbox Series X
3242960	3247920	back from my sister who's been borrowing it for the last four months. So I need to get that back
3247920	3252880	so I can finish that game. But yes, that is a great game. And I hear it has a great story. So
3254080	3261040	more of that, please. Like I will take you know, I'll take the kooza games are fun. I like that,
3261040	3264720	you know, but like, let's put that same team on like something else to like, you know,
3265760	3270400	yes, they are. They're now making that's now the main Yakuza series. So yes, they will be
3270400	3278000	making some nice roast muffin in our chat. Hello, hello says the seven remake is the best of the
3278000	3284160	like action based Final Fantasy. And I do I definitely agree the seven remake was far better
3284160	3289440	than it had any right to be like honestly, and just that one was okay. I maybe I can just ease
3289440	3296720	myself into that type of gameplay with seven and then go into 15. And yes, here's the thing about
3296720	3301120	seven like and I don't know how much you've spoiled yourself on the story. And quite frankly,
3301120	3305280	we're far past the moratorium on spoilers. And I ought to be able to talk openly about it now.
3305280	3311360	However, no, I'm gonna buy my tongue for the listeners. But I'm just gonna say, again,
3311360	3318720	the story in seven. Like you, you think you know, what's gonna happen. And I assure you,
3319520	3324960	you do not know what's going to happen. And it's it's worth playing. Because I think that
3324960	3332160	commentary in and of itself is very good. Like again, like this, the seven remake is really
3332160	3340160	worth playing just on the commentary of remakes in general. I'll say that much. It's very interesting.
3340800	3348080	So play it. All right. But I know I know how it goes. Look, you have a 200,000 brick mountain to
3348080	3355760	make in Minecraft. You have no fucking time. I'm done with the brick mountain for now. But yes,
3355760	3362240	I would need to go back. Yes, I would need to. Well, no, see, that's the thing like and going
3362240	3365680	back to the whole content creation thing. You don't know what's going on behind the scenes.
3365680	3370400	Like, I feel like constantly, it's like, okay, video put out now, clock reset, but it's still
3370400	3375280	ticking. You know, it's like, I gotta go out and put more stuff out, especially my hardcore series,
3375280	3379040	because there's that's what's bringing the viewers is that so like, I got to give the
3379040	3385520	people what they want. And so E3VL in chat says Final Fantasy seven remake is essentially a
3385520	3392480	multiverse game. That's about as far into spoiler territory. I'm going to let you go. But yes. Yes.
3392480	3399760	And that's, that's what yeah, the multiverse is all the rage right now. So I know I'm excited.
3400000	3405280	And let me tell you again, while we're talking multiverse, you must see the movie everything
3405280	3411600	everywhere all at once. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. And I apologize if I'm
3411600	3417600	hyping this up too much. But I really urge you don't read anything about the movie. Just go see
3417600	3424320	it and you will be so so satisfied. It is just it is just a good fucking movie. And it does. It goes
3424320	3429360	to show that movies do not have to be gigantic budgets, like Marvel style movies. That's no shade
3429360	3433520	on Marvel. Because you know, those those movies have their place too. But I am super excited
3433520	3437200	about Dr. Strange. Yeah, I know. And lots of people are and that's great. I'm excited. But
3438000	3443520	just just and Michelle Yeoh, end of sentence, Michelle Yeoh, period. End of sentence. That's
3443520	3447760	all that needs to be said. Michelle Yeoh, the grand and short round. I don't remember his name.
3447760	3453520	But yeah, like, I hear he's great in it. Oh, oh my god, that the fact that he's come back from
3453520	3460000	acting after like 40 years and does that. I mean, people are gonna forget this movie come Oscar
3460000	3465920	time and I don't put a lot of stock into awards. I hope not. It is it is our responsibility as the
3465920	3472960	internet internet rally around me. It is our responsibility as the internet period. A
3472960	3478880	corporation. Al Gore's internet is our responsibility. That the Academy does not forget
3478880	3484800	about this movie come next Oscar season. And if Michelle Yeoh doesn't get nominated,
3486400	3489920	I was gonna make a slap joke, but then I realized I'll be in bad taste. So I'm not gonna make it.
3489920	3494080	All right, let's move on. Loki, you have another story for us.
3494880	3505440	Yes. So Game Freak is implementing an optional four day workweek, which sounds amazing. So
3505440	3511760	they're giving employees an extra day off of the week for the purpose of childcare or family care.
3511760	3516880	And they're it's able to be done on a monthly basis to have like a flexible work environment,
3516880	3526720	they said, where needed. But it does come with a 20% pay cut. So if it's a four day workweek,
3527520	3531120	and you're not working an extra day, so there's not paying you for that paying you for that day.
3531120	3534640	Exactly. Yes. So that is a bit misleading.
3537280	3540480	That's just more. That's not paid time off either. That's
3540480	3545200	yeah, that's just that's just you can work only four days and we'll give you four fifth salary
3545200	3552720	for doing that. But I mean, you have an option. At least they have benefits.
3552720	3557280	Yeah, there are some people, you know, as much as we're kind of staring at this and
3557280	3562880	blinking right now. There are people where this would fit very well into their life.
3562880	3568320	And you know, it's like, oh, I could hold down a full time job and benefits and so forth. But also
3568320	3574160	have that extra day for the bandwidth, I need to, you know, take care of kids, go to school,
3574160	3578720	whatever it is, you know, everybody's life. And it's optional. So at least they have an
3578720	3583920	option to do that. And you know, it's you have just have to weigh it. But at the very least,
3584080	3588320	like if it were in the United States, and they were not paying you for that extra day,
3589200	3592480	they would probably take away your benefits as well. Because you're not a full time employee
3592480	3597680	at that point. You know, like, that's the kind of shitty things that US employers do. So
3599920	3602400	cool. Like to see them do that.
3602400	3607040	SSU 100. Matt says I do know places and friends who work at places where they have for
3607040	3612000	10 hour days. Yeah, I do. Actually, my Yeah, my day job company has this option as well.
3612960	3618000	First, most positions, sometimes the position doesn't kind of let you do that. But for most
3618000	3625520	positions, you can do that. But yeah, and for the work at home, especially where you're not
3625520	3628800	commuting. I think that works very well for a lot of people.
3628800	3635440	I would totally do that. But unfortunately, I'm your salary. So for my for 10 hour days,
3635440	3638880	and then another eight hour day, it's still paid the same. So it's like,
3639440	3643360	yeah, unfortunately, you can't do that. But that was an option. I know back when I was in our
3643360	3648960	customer service center, when we were in the call center, the EU could do for 10s if you wanted to.
3650000	3651360	I just couldn't swing that either.
3652320	3656960	Yeah. So again, sometimes with schedule, like, you know, you have kids, it's harder to work 10
3656960	3661040	hour days when you have to get your kid from school and those those sorts of needs. That's
3661040	3667920	harder to do. So you know, it just depends on your life situation. So but it's nice to see employers
3668640	3676800	have that flexibility. And I think that is a huge thing that the pandemic. Good employers have
3676800	3681680	responded to the pandemic with more flexibility. Good ones have and they'll they'll persevere for
3681680	3688880	that. Anyhow, let's move on. We were talking about PlayStation Plus a little bit ago.
3688880	3694880	Let's talk about those game trials. Because again, part of the perks for PlayStation Plus is that
3694880	3699760	you're supposed to get free game trials up to like a certain, I think two hours in or something
3699760	3705280	like that to really get a robust taste of the game. And there was some reporting going around
3705280	3711520	on social media that Sony is asking developers to create time limited trials for games for the new
3711520	3719040	PlayStation Plus premium service. But now it's coming out from Ethan Gack at Kotaku that actually
3719040	3724080	the PlayStation store team is going to take this on and set up the trials for the developers. So
3724080	3730720	it's interesting how that rumor led to this kind of shifting course here. But in a tweet, Ethan
3730720	3737680	says sources tell me, of course, a good old source, which means that somebody inside Sony that just
3737680	3742880	doesn't want to get in trouble. PlayStation store team will create the two hour time trials for
3742880	3748160	developers. So it shouldn't be extra work, though I've heard concerns from others about Sony
3748160	3753840	monetizing a perk and not sharing that revenue with studios. That's an interesting side effect
3754640	3759440	is that you know, there might be people that play the two hour demo and decide not to get the game.
3759440	3765200	And the publisher doesn't get anything from that, even though Sony did. Well, demos,
3766000	3772560	I would assume this is gonna work just like the trials work with I think. I think it was EA that
3772560	3777680	was, you know, actually, not that they mentioned the trials and stuff. Wasn't it Sony that was
3777680	3782880	doing that? I thought they were already doing trials for full games. Or maybe I'm thinking EA
3782880	3787360	or something like that through their like EA thinking early accessing, you're thinking of
3787360	3792400	EA through their EA player, whatever it's called. Yeah, I swear to God, though, there was something
3792400	3798880	outside of EA that was doing full, they were doing like, trials for like, full games or something
3798880	3803520	like that. Well, steam, if you want to, I mean, it's not really a trial, but they do the refund
3803520	3810880	within two hours. And some people abuse that as a trial. Well, no, not not like that. But like,
3810880	3822960	I want to say like, gosh, was it? PlayStation was through PlayStation Plus, actually, they had full
3822960	3828400	game trials, this is a great way to try before you buy, play a game for up to one hour or and
3828400	3832240	then purchase the game to unlock trophies and continue your progress. So this is something
3832240	3836320	they already had. This is not a new thing. They had it on PlayStation four. Interesting,
3836320	3840720	but now it's going up to two hours. And it's only going to be in PlayStation premium.
3841840	3843120	That's interesting.
3843120	3848640	Whoo, we we changed the one to a two and then we charged you for it.
3848640	3854080	That's that that that does on beyond that does track with Sony. Remember when playing online was
3854080	3861360	free? That's some that's some Yuji Naka level tweaking, you know, services there, you know.
3861360	3865760	Next story.
3868720	3873120	So you want to hear something scary? They're going to be making a Poppy Playtime movie.
3873120	3877760	No, that's pretty cool. No, I'm totally I would totally watch that. It's awesome. But yeah,
3877760	3884320	so Poppy Playtime, if you're not aware, is a indie survival horror video game that involves a
3884880	3893120	toy factory with, you know, fun creatures like Fuzzy Wuzzy or Huggy Wuggy or something like that.
3894640	3901280	I don't remember his name, but yes, so horror game with giant like puppets and stuff like that.
3901840	3908560	But it is being developed by Studio 71, who, if you're not familiar with that name, they did the
3908560	3915520	VHS series. It was like a bunch of kind of I don't know if it was like a horror anthology
3915520	3918640	or something like that. But I remember it had to do with like people finding VHS
3919200	3926640	tapes with like horrible things on it. So of course, you know, the company Mob Games
3927600	3932800	that develops the game is said that they could have never imagined that this game be so popular
3932800	3937920	as it is. And they're beyond excited to work with Studio 71 to transform Poppy into a feature film.
3938560	3946240	So I am excited. It's going to be scary. It is going to be damn scary. But like,
3947680	3953040	I want to see that. And also whatever happened to the stupid FNAF movie? Like,
3953040	3958080	is that ever going to happen? I'm so disappointed. Have you seen this? I got a
3959600	3964800	there's this post going around Facebook. Hold on. Okay. I didn't want to show the name of the
3964880	3969360	person. But I got I got it from the I'll show the name of the sheriff's office that shared it
3969360	3973840	because this is this is wild. Do you want to see this latest thing going around Facebook as I saw?
3973840	3979360	Because I used to at my old job, I used to work with some Karen's so I still follow some on
3979360	3984960	Facebook. And one of them posted this. So it's from Okay, hold on. Let's show this here. How do I
3985760	3989440	let me do? Hold on. Sorry, bear with me because I'm doing it live.
3989920	3996640	There. Okay. Attention parents. The county sheriff's office looked at the origins of a
3996640	4000640	controversy about a character named Huggy Wuggy from a survival horror video game called poppy
4000640	4005280	playtime. This is a survival horror video game developed and published by American indie developer
4005280	4011440	mob games, etc, etc, etc. They're issuing a warning to parents due to a series of videos
4011440	4016320	surrounding Huggy Wuggy. The warnings are due to the characters initially child friendly videos,
4016320	4021200	which very quickly turned nightmarish. The concerning videos are fan made,
4021200	4025520	produced by someone who admires a particular TV show, film or video game. Here are some of the
4025520	4030240	YouTube channels that made the concerning videos and there's a list there. The videos include
4030240	4035440	offensive language, cartoon representations of alcohol use, blood stabbings, decapitations,
4035440	4040080	attempted murder, murder and the bloody aftermath of a car crash. And one of the videos a toy
4040080	4044880	cartoon character tells a cartoon person, my hugs don't hurt one bit, you'll be dead before
4044880	4049280	the pain comes. The character then hugs and squeezes the person until they turn blue and
4049280	4060000	passes out. What? Why? Why are the police warning people about YouTube content is what I want to
4060000	4066720	know. That's what struck me as like wild. When I saw that Facebook post, I was like, wait, is this
4066720	4072880	is this actually poppy playtime or no, this is like YouTube people using poppy poppy playtime.
4072880	4078560	This is getting into the whole Elsa Spider-Man nonsense that the like the dark side of like
4078560	4083920	YouTube, like bot farms and stuff like that to create these weird like procedure, not even
4083920	4088560	procedurally generated, it's just like, just garbage stuff that children will click on.
4089840	4094480	And yeah, there's probably a lot of fan videos and stuff about poppy playtime and stuff because
4095360	4103360	because that's the thing. But I don't understand why the police need to be involved with this as
4103360	4108560	far as like, warning people in true video game fashion, or I'm sorry, in true Facebook fashion.
4108560	4113600	Can I go to this comment here? Yeah, first of all, the LCSD should be ashamed of itself for
4113600	4119360	this fear mongering anti video game post. Not all video games are for kids. Those still stuck in the
4119360	4123440	video games are toys for children mindset have no one to blame for themselves. If their children
4123440	4131360	are exposed to content they deem inappropriate 59 replies and I hesitate to think what they're
4131360	4136560	all gonna be positive anyway, I'm sure parents watch what your kids are consuming. That's the
4136560	4147920	bottom line here, right? All right. Sorry, I had to bring that up. I just when I saw that on
4147920	4152720	Facebook, I was like, what in the what is this world? Then I hope their kids get taken to the
4152720	4156560	movies to go see poppy playtime. The wonderful like, it's like the Muppets.
4157600	4162480	SSG 100. Matt says, Oh, God reading the comments live. Yeah, sometimes sometimes what does this
4162480	4167760	show become? Oh, I'm sure the movie can be rated R and kids will still show up anyway. Come on,
4167760	4172640	you go to any R rated movie these days. You go to you go to Mortal Kombat in the theaters and
4172640	4176480	people are like, Oh, whatever. I'm taking my kid because you know, it's a video game.
4176480	4183440	I saw this, I saw a video online about this theater chain that literally has
4183440	4187840	Emma assuming these are special theaters for like, kids movies and stuff, but they literally have
4187840	4194320	like, one of those play structures in the movie theater itself. It's like a McDonald's new play
4194320	4200960	structure thing with like movies and like actual kids movies and stuff. Tell me where I'm going
4200960	4206000	without telling me where I'm never going. I mean, I'm assuming it's for like special
4206560	4211760	like kids movies only but it'd be funny though they play poppy playtime that I prefer the reverse
4211760	4216320	of that like I don't know if they still do this but the kabuki kabuki theater in San Francisco
4216320	4221360	has several screens where since they sell alcohol, it's 21 and up only that is my favorite place to
4221360	4229280	see a movie. Yeah, that's I think they do that over here locally at our they call it the plaudio
4229280	4234800	Lux thing but they do have I think certainly screen times where it may serve alcohol time but
4234800	4241520	they have I think they do have certain it's a separate theater it's like right around the
4241520	4246080	corner of the regular patio but those are the ones where you have like the fancy like you can order
4246080	4252160	food and alcohol and stuff if you want and they have a bar but SSJ 100 Matt says I snuck into
4252160	4257440	barbed wire when I was 13. Wasn't that that Pamela Anderson movie? That movie is terrible.
4258160	4262960	Yeah, but you know what? There's there's a lot in that movie for a 13 year old boy.
4266160	4272240	At least y'all maybe maybe not all boys because I don't think that movie did anything for me but
4272240	4278240	some of y'all I'm sure really enjoyed that film despite the fact it was terrible. All right.
4278240	4283600	Anyhow, let's move on. Loki, why don't you tell us the most unsurprising news of the year?
4284320	4290720	There's gonna be a new Call of Duty what Activision making the game that makes the money
4290720	4298320	what so shocking. So they've announced that the new game they're putting out is Modern Warfare 2
4298320	4303200	and you may be thinking, well, wait a second there. I swear I remember there being a Modern
4303200	4308000	Warfare 2 before. In fact, I'm pretty sure there's a Modern Warfare 3. Well, this is the new Modern
4308000	4313040	Warfare 2, which is actually like Call of Duty 17 or something like that. I'm not really sure what
4313040	4317920	number that they're on now, but yeah, they're doing it's the sequel to the Modern Warfare
4319040	4326320	1 reboot thing. So it's a reboot sequel. Yeah, number 10 in the Modern Warfare series.
4327920	4329120	Do you own them all, Loki?
4331440	4333680	I own like the first three.
4336080	4342480	Technically, like, there's one, two and three. And then reflex was on the Wii, I think. And
4342480	4347360	then there's mobile games. There's the remasters. I don't have the remasters. And then I don't have
4347360	4352400	the new. I may have the new Modern Warfare because that may have been a PlayStation plus title at one
4352400	4359520	time. I may actually own all of them. I don't know, except for the mobile and the Wii version.
4359520	4361120	I wouldn't buy the Wii version.
4361120	4364960	Darktitsia in chat says maybe they should just put the year on it like Madden does.
4364960	4367440	Call of Duty 22. Would you play that?
4367440	4374240	I like the Modern Warfare games, honestly. I don't know how the last reboot thing was,
4374240	4378800	but like the first three Modern Warfare games were pretty good. I really like the first three
4378800	4385040	ones. But that's that's Activision of like the way past when it wasn't super terrible. Like the
4385040	4390880	games are good and they didn't have a loot boxes and stuff. But we're never going back to those
4390880	4392560	days again. Unfortunately.
4392560	4397040	E3VL in chat says can't put the year. They'll think it's based on Ukraine Russia war. Oof.
4397120	4402480	But I mean, kind of true. I mean, yeah, yeah, there are people types of conclusions.
4403120	4408400	And then there's another fun thing. So with Call of Duty Vanguard, they've added a new anti cheat
4409440	4416240	tool that now allows them to basically detect when they're doing the cheating. And they have
4416240	4422080	a new mitigation technique called cloaking that will make everybody but the cheater invisible.
4422080	4429440	So if they catch you wall hacking, you're going to be wall hacking ghosts, I guess.
4431040	4435600	The ways they trap and screw over cheat. Well, I mean, I wouldn't call it screwing over cheaters
4435600	4439600	because cheaters deserve it. But, you know, the pranks, I don't know, the punks they're playing
4439600	4444800	on cheaters are getting funnier and funnier. Devs are more and more clever with how they do that.
4444800	4448720	I always like the cheater island where you just put the cheater in games with other cheaters and
4448720	4453760	let them Yeah, that was granted thought of online, they used to do that. And people
4453760	4457040	just didn't really care. Like, oh, well, you know, well, right. That's,
4457600	4461280	and a lot of times you get put there for stupid things. I think some people like
4461280	4467680	being on cheater Island, quite frankly. So yeah, yeah. So well, you know, this is
4469600	4475360	it's not that ridiculous. You know, at least they're doing something unlike, you know, what
4476320	4481840	they're doing with what Blizzard is doing with Overwatch two, which is basically nothing.
4483120	4492880	Well, moving on to another story is that there's now 91 games that you can no longer play online.
4492880	4497200	Now, I do want to make sure there's kind of two important parts of the story because one of the
4497200	4502880	headlines that's going around is that Ubisoft is going to be shutting down services for 91 games.
4503200	4509040	But here's what's actually happened is that there was a blog post with a timestamp that was wrong
4509040	4514240	on it that said there's a list of 91 games have now been shut down. So it made it look like all
4514240	4519200	these games were shut down at once. But Ubisoft actually apologized for the confusion saying,
4519840	4526400	these are games that have all ended online services over the last year. So it is not 91
4526400	4531440	games that they shut down all at once. These are 91 games that have been actually shut down over
4531440	4536800	the last year. Most people probably just haven't talked about, yeah, it's a lot, but most people
4536800	4542000	probably haven't talked about it because most people probably didn't even notice. I mean,
4542000	4549760	there's games that are on this list that are on the Xbox 360, Far Cry Blood Dragon on PS3, Xbox 360
4549760	4556240	and PC, no longer playable online, but there's games on here for the Wii. How about Just Dance
4556240	4562400	3 Kids? I know I'm sure you're all beat up about that. But Just Dance 3 Kids is no longer playable
4562400	4568080	online. But there are some relatively newer games like that Far Cry Blood Dragon was released in
4568080	4574480	2020, I think, right? That game was awesome. Yeah. So Blood Dragon was not released in 2020.
4574480	4580320	You're right. I'm mixing it up. That's the date that it was actually retired.
4581200	4584800	Yeah, Blood Dragon came out a while ago, but that game is fantastic.
4584800	4590320	That is like one of the best spin offs of Far Cry game ever.
4590320	4595600	Yeah. I'm trying to see some games in here that are definitely taken down a bit more recently.
4596560	4604880	Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Rainbow Six Vegas, Rainbow Six Lockdown. So anyway, it's just part of the
4604880	4610320	natural ebb and flow of the cycle of video games is that online servers, they get shut down,
4611360	4616400	especially if no one's on there playing them. So perhaps we need to go back to a simpler time
4616400	4623680	when there were no video games servers online. So you could just keep playing games forever.
4623680	4626480	So let's get to this segment.
4635600	4641040	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4641040	4646000	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
4647040	4653520	Well, and as we discussed earlier in the show, Dark Sakura is not here tonight. So I'm picking
4653520	4658320	tonight's classic game, which I have picked Ultima. And I'm sorry, Loki. I would have let
4658320	4661760	you pick this time, but I didn't have a lot of notice. So I just had to throw something together.
4662480	4667760	So I had to think like, all right, what haven't I done yet? That's a game that I have a lot of
4667760	4674000	feelings. I could just talk about this game very easily for a little bit. And I came up on Ultima
4674000	4679280	4 Quest of the Avatar. So I've talked a little bit about Ultima 3. I think, you know, years ago,
4679440	4683920	I picked that as a classic game. But I want to talk a little bit about Ultima 4, because Ultima
4683920	4692880	4 is like, the whole Ultima series in general is really an RPG series that gave us a lot that it
4692880	4699440	often doesn't get credited enough for. Because Ultima 4, I mean, and the original Ultima series
4699440	4704320	was of course by Richard Garriott, Lord British on the PC and DOS based systems. Apple, I think
4704320	4709840	may have been where those games first started. They got ported everywhere. But a lot of modern
4709840	4716640	RPGs have a lot from Ultima to thank. And you'll notice that I'm actually playing Ultima 4,
4716640	4720080	the video here tonight and the music I think you're hearing on stream, I think it's coming
4720080	4725840	through, is coming from the NES version of the game. Because this is where I remember playing
4725840	4730320	Ultima 4 for the first time. It might surprise you, I did not play this on the Commodore 64 at
4730320	4736000	first or any of that stuff. But I actually originally played this on the NES. I want
4736000	4741360	to show you real quick, pardon the live screenshot switching here, but I want to show you real quick
4741360	4748160	what this looks like on the PC because it was a very, very different looking game on the PC.
4748160	4752880	You know, this, it looked a lot more like a traditional role playing game might look,
4753920	4758800	where you're actually having to input things and try to get, you know, the characters to
4758880	4763600	interact with you by typing things. You actually see your character moving north, south, east and
4763600	4770800	west. But a lot of this was changed for the NES. So it's just interesting that it is the same game
4770800	4776560	essentially, but they did a lot to really streamline a lot of the stuff that might feel
4776560	4782080	a little bit micromanagy in the game otherwise. So let me flip back here. I'm going to flip back
4782080	4787040	to the NES version because quite honestly, I think it has a better soundtrack. Oops,
4787280	4791600	sorry, sorry. Now I'm overlaying both games. That's what happens when I have to do it all
4791600	4797760	myself live. Okay, let's get into the weeds a little more on Ultima IV. It was released
4797760	4803440	in 1985, originally for the Apple II. It's considered part of the Age of Enlightenment
4803440	4812480	trilogy. So the interesting thing about Ultima IV, it's the first RPG in quite some time.
4812480	4818720	You're not trying to overcome a tangible Ultima evil. You're not trying to beat chaos.
4819280	4826800	You're not trying to defeat Lord Evil Doer. You know, this is a very different setup in this game.
4827360	4832640	So basically the way this is all put together is that the Triad of Evil from the previous Ultima
4832640	4838960	games changed the world of Sosaria. So some of the world disappeared. There were new continents.
4838960	4842400	It's just basically a way for them to come up with a new map for Sosaria, basically.
4844320	4850080	Lord British, who, you know, is kind of tongue in cheek, a representation of Richard Garriott
4850080	4855360	in the games, but he's the actual Lord over Britannia. He felt that people lacked purpose
4855920	4860880	after the struggles against the Triad were over and he was concerned with spiritual well-being.
4860880	4866480	So he proclaimed the quest of the Avatar. He needed someone to come forward and be the
4866480	4871600	shining example for others to follow. And that's what this game is, is your ultimate quest of
4871600	4876800	enlightenment, the quest of the Avatar. So you don't really, like, you're not against like,
4876800	4881040	oh, we've got this big bad we've got to do. So that's kind of interesting, I think.
4882880	4886320	Also in the beginning of the game, and a lot of people know this from the beginning of the game,
4886320	4892880	you're asked a series of questions that ultimately determine how your principles of truth,
4892880	4898080	love, and courage come together to choose what you're going to play in the game. I'm
4898080	4902960	going to rewind the stream here a little bit so you can see it again. But this first section of
4902960	4908720	the game is actually asking you questions about how you would respond in certain scenarios
4908720	4912320	that ultimately determine the class that you're going to play. So for example,
4913280	4919040	we're going to, let me get the next question here. Fighting it, oh, sorry, this person's
4919040	4922160	speed running it so it's like flying by. Let me try to get one of these questions.
4923520	4927920	Listen carefully. Entrusted to deliver an uncounted purse of gold, thou dost meet a
4927920	4932800	poor beggar. Dost thou deliver the gold knowing the trust in thee was well placed, or show
4932800	4937680	compassion, giving the beggar a coin, knowing it shan't be missed? So you're basically taking a
4937680	4943520	personality quest at the beginning of the game. And so in this scenario, do you A, honestly give
4943520	4949760	the money back, or B, show compassion and give the beggar a coin? So based on your answer here,
4949760	4955360	you're going to tilt the scales to either A, honesty, truth, which is a mage, it's embodied
4955360	4962800	by the mage in the game, which is pure, pure truth, honesty, or compassion is pure love,
4962800	4968480	and that is embodied by a bard. So the way you answer these questions, and so the person runs
4968480	4972880	through all these questions here in the intro and I think they ultimately land on a druid.
4972880	4979840	If I saw that, um, play by quick here. So this person landed on truth and love or justice coming
4979840	4985840	together. So you can actually have, and there are, there are eight classes. So truth is a mage,
4985840	4992560	love is a bard, courage is a fighter, truth and love is a druid, love and courage is a, um,
4992560	5000160	tinkerer, truth and courage is a paladin, truth, love, and courage is considered spirituality,
5000160	5006240	and that is a ranger. Or you can actually take a challenge in the game and play none,
5006800	5013440	a character with humility, one that has neither truth, love, nor courage, and that is a shepherd.
5014080	5021760	Now the character, the classes that you don't end up picking end up being NPCs in the game.
5021760	5025280	So if I fast forward in the footage here a little more, you'll notice that our druid
5025280	5028480	has put together a party here where it looks like I think they have the fighter,
5028480	5032400	and I think that's the ranger that they put together in their party there. So those
5032400	5038000	characters exist as NPCs and you put together a party of four people by going around the world
5038000	5042640	and completing quests and putting your party together to, you know, help you on your quest
5042640	5047440	to become the avatar. So I think it's really neat, like it's just, it's kind of a neat way
5047440	5053280	of building the game, like asking like, you know, your character being reflected by a personality
5053280	5058480	quest or a personality test, I think is really neat, and just how it impacts the ultimate game
5058480	5066000	and potentially its difficulty. So how did this game come about? Well, Richard Garriott got no
5066000	5071280	feedback because California Pacific Computer and Sierra Online never forwarded him mail.
5072560	5079360	So he finally realized from letters from enraged parents that in the earlier games,
5079360	5085360	doing immoral actions like stealing and murdering peaceful citizens might be things that people
5085360	5091200	would find objectionable. So Richard Garriott took on the task of wanting to be a good storyteller,
5091200	5097120	but a story that has content, and realized that 90% of games out there were just go kill the bad
5097120	5103440	guy. So Ultima IV ended up being a game about ethical overtones and ended up being a better
5103440	5109840	told story. In his official biography, it was said he decided that if people were going to
5109840	5114720	look for hidden meaning in his work when they didn't even exist, he would introduce ideas and
5114720	5119440	symbols with meaning and significance he deemed worthwhile to give them something they could
5119440	5125200	really think about. So the way this is all set up with a personality test and everything,
5125200	5129920	you're supposed to imagine that you're playing yourself in the fantasy realm and not a separate
5129920	5133360	person, and that was kind of something a little unique for this game at the time as well.
5134960	5141040	And he removed elements like playing a non-human because he worried that this would prevent players
5141040	5145840	from identifying personally with their character. So I think that's very, very interesting.
5146480	5153200	The ankh is oftentimes used as the symbol of the avatar, and Richard Garriott saw this originally
5153200	5158000	in the film Logan's Run and decided to use this in his game, and that ankh kind of became a symbol
5158000	5164480	for Ultima later on. This game came out on the Apple II, the Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit platforms,
5164480	5171760	a PC-DOS version, the Amiga and the Atari ST, the NES. It was on the Sega Master System, actually.
5171760	5177280	I always forget that the Ultima IV was on the Sega Master System. And I think, if I remember right,
5179520	5185840	sorry while I'm doing this live, but sometimes I do it that way, I want to say that the Sega
5185840	5188880	Master System, okay, we're going to look at somebody who's actually speedrunning the game.
5188880	5193200	I want to say, yeah, it looked more like the PC version. It didn't look like the NES version.
5193200	5199200	The NES version was done with completely redone graphics and things like that, and I want to say
5199200	5205120	the same team that did Ultima III did that. But it's interesting to see Ultima IV, I think,
5206080	5212800	on a console but more like the PC version. Oh, kind of interesting. Anyway, the reception for
5212800	5217520	this game, believe it or not, and it's interesting because ZenMonkey11 in chat says this game seems
5217520	5224560	confusing. I think it is. It may not have held up well over time because games have generally
5224560	5229680	gotten easier and so forth, just in that, you know, you don't have to manually type to a
5229680	5237280	character what you want to do anymore. But what this game did for the genre, people consider this
5237280	5242000	one of the best games ever made, if you can believe it. And I do, I do. I think, you know,
5242000	5247680	a lot of times games like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest get credited for the genre. But I think
5247680	5253280	Ultima IV especially did a ton of stuff for the role-playing genre. And I think there's a lot
5253280	5258720	that we see in games today, especially things like, I would say, the Elder Scrolls series,
5258720	5263920	which also lets you kind of embody yourself in the main character that has Ultima IV to thank for it.
5264480	5271520	Computer Gaming World named Ultima IV as the game of the year in 1986.
5272560	5278480	In 1986, Dragon Magazine called Ultima IV the most impressive and complex adventure to date.
5279040	5284000	Famitsu reviewed the Famicom version of the game and only gave it a 31,
5284640	5288560	but the Sega Master System of the game got an 89% in computer and video games.
5289520	5296320	The co-creator of D&D, Dave Arntzen, said in 1988, Ultima IV and a few other games
5296320	5301760	have stood pretty much alone as quirks instead of trendsetters in the computer RPG industry,
5301760	5306320	as other games do not follow their innovations. And I think there was another one here.
5307440	5315120	Yeah, in 1996, Computer Gaming World named this game the second best video game of all time.
5315520	5320960	So, interesting. I'm sorry, did I not say Famitsu out of 40? Yeah, 31 out of 40. I'm sorry if I
5320960	5326720	was reading fast and trying to multitask here, so lots going on. But anyway, that's a little insight
5326720	5333760	to Ultima IV, Quest of the Avatar. And I know I played this game quite a bit. It was a hard game.
5333760	5339120	The battle systems, I found to be kind of hard. I would really like to go back and revisit this
5339120	5343840	game someday as, like, not a kid, because I bet there would be more in the game I would
5344720	5348960	understand that maybe I didn't understand as well before when I first played this game.
5348960	5353680	But yeah, I think this game is really, it was really transformative for RPGs, especially
5355440	5361040	on these shores and deserves a lot of credit. Questbuster in chat says Ultima IV was big for
5361040	5365840	a number of reasons, but probably it was because of its focus on self-improvement as opposed to
5365840	5370720	just go kill the big evil that really shook things up, as Rob pointed out. Well, thank you.
5370720	5376960	And there it is, the classic game of the week, Ultima IV, Quest of the Avatar.
5378480	5382240	Nice. All right. You ever played that game, Loki?
5382880	5387840	I have not. I actually don't think I've really played any of the Ultima games, except for,
5387840	5393360	briefly, Ultima Online was at a friend's house, and we were just being obnoxious children.
5393360	5398480	Yeah, there's nine games. Well, if you don't count online, there's nine games in the Ultima series,
5398480	5402560	if I remember right, because what pagan was eight, and I think there was one after that.
5402560	5407920	So, and they're basically, they are a trilogy of trilogies. And as I kind of referenced there,
5407920	5412640	one, two, and three were its own trilogy where it is go beat the bad guy. But then four, five,
5412640	5417600	and six kind of started this journey of enlightenment sort of series. And then seven,
5417600	5421440	eight, nine, I don't remember exactly. I kind of lost track of the series at that point,
5421440	5428800	but they were their own trilogy of things. So, yeah. Anyway, it's really a game worth visiting.
5428800	5435120	And I think especially the NES versions of the Ultima games are really overlooked by time,
5436000	5439760	because they are so radically different from the computer versions, which are the ones that are
5439760	5445520	credited for being so revolutionary. But the soundtracks to both those games too are really
5445520	5450880	good. I talk about Ultima III a lot. I remember the music in Ultima III very well. It is such a
5450880	5457600	good soundtrack, but those games haven't really held up in gaming people's memory quite as well.
5457600	5462400	I would love to see those games in a compilation someday. Those are the games for me I would love
5462400	5466640	to see on the Switch online, but I realized the rights issues gets complicated and so where they
5466640	5472880	got to convince Richard Garriott it's a good idea, I suppose. So, yeah. All right. Let's check
5472880	5477600	out some other headlines in a segment we call Rapid Fire News. And you got a few things tonight
5477600	5482800	for us, Loki. Yeah. So, Bethesda, because you know they are getting rid of their dedicated
5482800	5487280	launcher, they are going to be putting their games on Steam. And so, as part of that, they
5487280	5493120	have added five of their classic games to Steam, and some of which are actually free at the moment.
5493120	5499600	So, Elder Scrolls, you get the Elder Scrolls Arena, Elder Scrolls II Daggerfall, the Elder
5499600	5505600	Scrolls Adventures Redguard, and Elder Scrolls Legend Battlespire and Wolfenstein Enemy Territory.
5506560	5512480	Elder Scrolls Arena and Daggerfall are free. And also, apparently, Wolfenstein Enemy Territory is
5513040	5517760	zero dollars right now. I'm not sure that's going to stay that way, but go.
5517760	5522480	I grabbed the two, I forgot about the Wolfenstein game, so I got to go grab that too. But the two,
5523360	5530800	yeah, I grabbed those today. And just a reminder, you can now transfer your Bethesda launcher titles
5530800	5534880	over to Steam. When this was first reported on a couple months ago, that wasn't available yet,
5534880	5540320	but that is available now. And so, I actually had all three Quake games, because Bethesda gave
5540320	5545040	them away for free if you downloaded the launcher during QuakeCon at some point. So, now I have all
5545040	5550400	those games on Steam. So, just kind of fun. So, you can transfer that all over today. It's pretty
5550400	5554880	easy. You just link your Bethesda account to your Steam account, and then you push a button and
5554880	5557680	wait, basically. Yeah, I got to go do that.
5557680	5563760	Yeah. You have to, I mean, I don't think you can ever not do it, but you might have a lapse when
5563840	5568720	the Bethesda launcher goes away to play the game if you don't go move them over. So, you might as
5568720	5571440	well go ahead and do it. And grab the free games while you're at it. They're free.
5572240	5578000	Sure. The Super Mario Brothers animated movie, which is supposed to come to theaters this
5578000	5584560	Christmas, is now going to be delayed to April 2023. So, that was put out by a tweet from
5584560	5590800	Nintendo, or I guess Miyamoto, because it says this is Miyamoto. But yes, it's now been delayed
5590800	5600400	to April 7th and April 28th in Japan. So, oh, well, we'll just wait longer, I guess.
5600400	5601120	All right, whatever.
5602000	5602240	Yeah.
5603040	5606720	Fifth Dream in chat says, Christmas canceled by Nintendo. You know what,
5606720	5613600	though? Here's something to consider. The theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood
5613600	5617360	is going to open around that same timeframe. It's not opening this holiday. It's opening
5617360	5618640	spring 2023.
5627920	5636080	Apparently, BBC Proms is celebrating classical and orchestral music every year. They have live
5636080	5643120	concerts and they're going to be showcasing, for the first time, video game music this summer.
5643920	5649600	So, on August 1st, they're going to have gaming prom from 8Bit to Infinity,
5649600	5655360	which will be performed at the Royal Albert Hall in London and conducted by Robert Ames.
5656000	5660960	That's awesome. Yeah, Jason referenced that in the intro a little bit. And I hope there's a way
5660960	5664800	for us to watch it over here, that the content gets on YouTube and isn't region locked or
5664800	5669440	something. I'd love to see it. I think it'd be pretty great. Just coming off a couple of weeks
5669440	5675280	ago, seeing the San Francisco Symphony doing the Dear Friends, but the other Final Fantasy concert,
5675280	5681840	whatever they're calling it now. Distant Worlds, that was it. It's great to see the symphonies
5681840	5685920	performing the video game music. Again, it's art. It's a part of our culture. It's what we've grown
5685920	5694240	up on. Yeah. And then if you are interested in getting some more Animal Crossing music,
5694240	5702320	Animal Crossing New Horizons has the original Soundtrack 2 coming out on CD here. Also,
5702320	5709120	there is going to be a KK Slider vinyl album that's been released or revealed, I guess.
5709920	5718480	The Soundtrack 2 is set to release in Japan June 22nd and priced at 7,480 yen and apparently
5718480	5727440	includes 140 tracks across five CDs. And then of course, the vinyl album, which is supposed to be
5727440	5739200	released November 23rd and priced at 4,620 yen and has 19 songs in all. So 18 KK Slider music
5739200	5744880	instrumental collection and one bonus track. I wonder if Dark Sakura, I know she loves her KK
5744880	5748320	Slider songs. I wonder if she's going to get that vinyl. It seems like something that's up around.
5748320	5753840	Maybe. I'll have to ask her next week. All right. Well, now let's see what else we can buy this week
5753840	5758320	as we travel around the world and check out some release dates. So, Loki, what's coming out in the
5758320	5766320	US this week? In the US, we have Citizen Sleeper on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
5767040	5775680	Trek the Yomi on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. And honestly, that's it.
5776640	5782480	Sure. Well, probably part of the reason it's quiet over here is that it's very quiet over
5782480	5786720	in Japan this week, because if I'm not mistaken, it's Golden Week in Japan, because I've seen some
5786720	5791280	of the sales starting on the stores in honor of Golden Week. And looking at the release dates,
5791280	5794960	there is nothing. There's some accessories coming out this week. We don't really talk about those a
5794960	5799120	lot. There are no games coming out this week in Japan. We don't really get to anything until May
5799120	5805520	12th on the Switch. When Dead by Daylight gets a release in Japan on the Switch, I think it's a new
5805520	5811280	compilation on the 12th. But as far as this week goes, nothing in Japan. So play what you already
5811280	5815600	got. Get caught up in your backlog. How about the UK, Loki? I imagine it's pretty slow.
5815600	5820320	The UK, they're just getting Sifu on PlayStation.
5821280	5827360	So all right. So a holiday week in Japan kind of slows down the gaming industry around the world.
5827360	5831440	But it's understandable, especially with a lot of games. Well, a lot of games from April. Yeah,
5831440	5837680	April, May is usually pretty dead anyway. So it's not not surprised. It is. Just because at this
5837680	5842240	point, companies are going to hold their games until school's out. And we have well to play
5842240	5847520	through games. So yeah, typically a lot of the stuff gets held until it used to be like June
5847520	5854080	would be kind of a little bit of a release window and then dead for July for sure. July is like an
5854080	5859200	absolute dead month. August is kind of like let's jump into the fourth quarter in the third quarter.
5859200	5865040	And then it just ramps up from there until December. All right. We have a few more stories
5865040	5870000	for you. And then we're going to take your calls and your emails and your other participation in
5870000	5874640	our listener roundtable. If you want to give us a call, join our discord. You can also talk with us
5874640	5880000	throughout the week on discord over at vog network.com. That's vognetwork.com slash discord.
5880000	5883120	If you want to call into the show, you want to head on over to the green room and we will be
5883120	5887520	pulling people in. But we'll get to that a little later. For now we have some headlines. Loki.
5888400	5892960	Yeah, let's talk about Twitch. The Twitch is looking to make some more money because they
5892960	5898960	apparently they are not making enough money. So they are considering some major changes to their
5898960	5904960	monetization practices, none of which actually benefit the streamers, unfortunately. So right
5904960	5914000	now, Twitch is looking to propose a cut to, I guess, certain partnered streamers from normally,
5914000	5920800	I guess they get 70% of the revenue from Twitch subscriptions. It's going to be dropped down to
5920800	5928640	50%, which is what affiliates make. Also, they're going to be doing some things to
5929120	5937840	um, I don't know if it's incentivize more ads to be played. Not really sure what that necessarily
5937840	5946880	means. And they're going to have a new tier system for partnered streamers as well. So yeah,
5946880	5952080	I don't know a lot of stuff is contractual stuff that I don't have anything to really do. Yeah,
5952080	5958320	so incentives for more ads, no more exclusivity, which I guess is all right. So no longer will they
5958320	5962000	force you to only stream on Twitch, you can actually stream on other platforms.
5964160	5969680	Let's be real, there are a lot of we're very good, you know, folks here at VOG, where we don't,
5969680	5976640	you know, put this show up on YouTube immediately after it's broadcast here on Twitch. But there's
5976640	5981600	a lot of people that do things like that. And they're just like, well, you know, it's what
5981600	5985360	Twitch isn't going to find out. And Twitch never does find out. But technically, you are in
5985360	5990640	violation of your contract. So maybe, you know, Twitch realizes they can't enforce this. So why
5990640	5999920	not make it a perk? Yeah, so I don't know. It's just, it kind of sucks that they're going to be
5999920	6004960	doing a lot of stuff. And of course, it's not been taken positive at all by anybody, I think
6004960	6009440	it's because it's literally taking away people's income. But but you know, what are you going to
6009440	6014880	do? Because it's, you know, something's got to give if Twitch doesn't make money, then the
6014880	6020880	platform disappears. And then people are up shit Creek. Oh, yes. Because Amazon doesn't make enough
6020880	6026160	money. My well, my advice to full time streamers is you better have a plan for if Twitch closes
6026160	6032000	tomorrow. Like that's my honest advice. You better have a plan for if Twitch closes tomorrow.
6032960	6037680	What are you gonna do? I don't even know here at VOG network, what do we do? I have an idea what we
6037680	6044880	do. But uh, you know, there's, there's pretty easy, you just do it on YouTube, or it always
6044880	6049920	go back to doing it on shoutcast. So but I don't know, I don't know, we don't really have an answer
6049920	6054880	yet. But you need to, you know, if but we also don't make a lot of money off this we don't make,
6054880	6059280	in fact, we doesn't really pay any of our, our personal bills. We don't make any money
6059280	6064480	personally from this. It pays for VOG to be a legitimate business. And it pays for once in a
6064480	6074320	while, some nice sponsorships and conventions and things like that. So yeah. Anyway, um, so I,
6074320	6078080	you know, Twitch is obviously in this situation where they're not making as much money as Amazon,
6078080	6084960	the big Amazon feels like they should. It's leading this tricky situation, I suppose.
6086080	6092720	So yeah. We'll see. All right. I wonder if I wonder if they aren't gonna,
6093600	6098640	I would think they're gonna start to gate up how long it takes to get to affiliate.
6099600	6104960	That's my honest advice. If you think you might want to become a Twitch affiliate at some point,
6105840	6109440	I would really encourage you to start that process sooner rather than later.
6110160	6114400	But let's be honest, though, like, there's there's nothing stopping them from taking affiliate
6114400	6119280	status away from you. There really isn't look at YouTube. I mean, YouTube, I used to be able to
6119280	6126160	make ad money off of like my channel. And now it's like, no, yeah, no, totally fair point.
6126160	6135440	So we'll see what happens. All right. Moving on. Next story. Also look, yes, Disney is or I should
6135440	6143200	say Gameloft is releasing a new Disney game called Disney dreamlight Valley, which looks kind of like
6143200	6150320	a cross between Animal Crossing and say like The Sims with like a bunch of Disney stuff thrown in.
6151520	6159600	It is a free to play game that is going to be on console and PC. And it'll be launching in 2023.
6162080	6165520	It's all I mean, it looks all right. I know there's some people that probably be into this,
6165520	6172480	but I get really wary when it's a Gameloft title. And I could just see monetization
6172480	6176080	out the ass for this. Yeah, it's one of those things where it's like it has the potential
6176080	6181360	to be really good. There's a lot of good things in that formula. But it's one of those we really
6181360	6184960	can't pass judgment on it until we can actually play it because it's one of those things that can
6184960	6190960	go many directions. It could really be surprising. It could really be a cash cow that just, you know,
6190960	6198160	leaves cow patties everywhere. So we'll see. Yeah, it looks neat, though, as long as it's
6198800	6204320	awesome. I would prefer this was more like a Disney Infinity type game. And that's almost
6204320	6210640	kind of the vibe I got from some of that stuff. But it's a free to play game. Like just make a
6210640	6215120	console game. Like, why is it so hard that we can't just like, like, honestly, like, imagine
6215120	6219440	like, if they made just like an Animal Crossing game, just like they can even sell DLC for like
6219440	6224400	different things like Oh, hey, you want like, you know, the Nightmare Before Christmas stuff. Now
6224400	6227600	we'll send and sell you a Nightmare Before Christmas thing and they could like piecemeal
6227600	6232800	it out that way. Instead of it being free. I just whatever.
6234240	6238800	As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says serious Disney fans are
6238800	6247760	a different breed and will either love this or be shit on. Yes. Very that. Another story next also
6247760	6256240	from Loki. So Bungie has unfortunately kind of received a little bit of a loss when it came to
6256240	6264240	going after cheat sellers. For destiny to they apparently were going after the website aim junkie
6264240	6273840	saying that they were in violation of copyright infringement. But apparently the judge did not
6273840	6286080	feel that way. So they have dismissed the claims for the copyright was the non trade, I guess
6286080	6290960	trademark really claims they've dismissed that they said that the non trademark really claims
6290960	6298400	should skip the court and be resolved via arbitration. But apparently, though, the aim
6298400	6304480	junkies I guess and they have the legal team have dismissed the copyright infringement claims saying
6304480	6309600	that, you know, they haven't actually copied anything. Because they're kind of just like
6309600	6317120	circumventing their cheat software or something like that. So that means that makes sense that
6317120	6321120	they wouldn't get them on that. But I still think in the end, they're probably, you know,
6321120	6325840	bungees got a lot more money when it comes to lawyers, I would think so they probably gonna
6325840	6329760	end up getting them on the other stuff. We'll just see what happens on appeal because that's
6329760	6336240	how these things always go. Right. Exactly. Yeah. All right, stay tuned. Something else you might
6336240	6342640	want to stay tuned for if you're a roblox player is a performance from Lizzo, who's pretty amazing
6342640	6348560	and has a new album coming out. Lizzo is going to be doing a concert in the metaverse on April 30.
6349520	6356320	I mean, here's the end. This is no disrespect to Lizzo. She's she's great. But this whole thing
6356320	6360880	is being hyped up. It's like, oh, it's a concert in the meta. Hasn't Fortnite been doing concerts?
6360880	6368000	I mean, I know Fortnite isn't technically the metaverse. But isn't it kind of like that? I
6368000	6373760	don't get it. They've already done concerts before in Roblox too, I want to say. Yeah, it's weird.
6374720	6380320	Anyway, Logitech is doing Oh, maybe this is it. Logitech says it's the first music award show in
6380320	6387600	the metaverse. It's the song breaker awards and Lizzo will be doing her first virtual performance
6387600	6395120	in this music award show calling it the metaverse. Jesus Christ, it's just a game call it VR chat.
6395120	6399840	That's what it is. It's like just like it's just like, oh, let's use the buzzword buzzword the
6399840	6405600	blockchain metaverse pass. Give us money now. Money, money. I'm gonna tell you this much,
6405600	6410560	you know, you can throw up the word metaverse all you want for Roblox. But like their stock
6410560	6415920	prices aren't doing as good as they used to like that stuff that launched at like 80 bucks a share
6415920	6423200	and it's down to like 50 I think so. Yeah, it ain't sell anybody on the metaverse stuff.
6423200	6427760	Questbuster says Hatsune Miku concerts have been a thing in PlayStation Home Japan.
6427760	6435200	That's pretty cool. No, it's Zen monkey. It's not in VR chat. It's in Roblox. I was just calling it
6435200	6439920	VR chat because that's what the metaverse is. The metaverse is just VR chat under a different name.
6439920	6445680	That's all it is. I don't just it's a really bad word that they're gonna beat it to death. Like
6445680	6453280	it's just like I'm so sick of hearing about metaverse. Like it's just it's so dumb. Yeah.
6454240	6460880	All right. Well, that's it for the stories that we had on deck for tonight. So we invite you to
6460880	6465920	give us a call if you'd like over in our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
6466480	6472720	We also have our mailbag, which I will get to here in a moment. While I open up the mailbag,
6472720	6475600	Loki, is there any other headlines we missed tonight that you want to talk about?
6476400	6480560	Not really.
6481680	6486160	We have one email. So we have something for tonight. We have an email. YYR has been
6486160	6491760	emailing us a lot, but I surely don't mind. I always enjoy hearing from YYR. So we have
6491760	6497600	this email tonight from YYR saying hello, LR. Just a note on something you mentioned in last week's
6497600	6503360	episode. Sonic Origins will be releasing this month. However, if all you want are the original
6503360	6509360	games at a reasonable price without the scummy DLC, you should know that the original Xbox 360
6509360	6515360	versions of Sonic one, two, three and Knuckles, as well as Sonic CD are still currently available for
6515360	6522000	$5 each via backwards compatibility on Xbox one and series consoles. And if you buy Sonic and
6522000	6527200	Knuckles, you can use the lock on feature with any of Sonic one through three if you also purchase
6527200	6531840	those. However, if this sounds like a good alternative to you, you probably shouldn't
6531840	6535920	wait too long to jump on it. This may have been mentioned during the show already. No,
6535920	6541280	I was saving it for this actually. I read ahead tonight. But all of those titles are about to be
6541280	6547840	delisted on May 20th. Just saying. It just really irritates me that they want to charge so much for
6547840	6552320	these games now, especially considering that they're also adding the sorts of things we get,
6552880	6558960	we used to get for free in these collections as paid DLC. Just stop. Anyway, thanks again for the
6558960	6565120	show and enjoy your week. Happy to save a buck here and there. Aaron or yyr and I'm going to add
6565120	6571120	a PS that he didn't write but I'm putting it there. PS by falling plus on Xbox now. It's
6571120	6575680	available. Oh, I got the number one score and falling was I haven't checked to see if it's
6575680	6581280	still there. I should I if anyone dethrone me it was this issue 100 Matt, but I got the number one
6581280	6585840	score and falling plus at some point. Oh, do you take it back? All right, Matt took it back. I just
6585840	6595760	haven't logged in to look at it. So I guess I got to play again. But yeah, so check out falling
6595760	6600240	plus on Xbox if you want to get in our pissing match over a high score in that game. But that's
6600240	6607440	been fun. Bobby Black Wolf and chat says I had it. You did. You had it for a moment.
6607520	6616240	As soon as Matt says buy the game and dethrone me please. Yes, dethrone us both. Um, so anyway,
6616240	6622720	back to the point in Aaron's email about the games being delisted. Yeah. Um, they never did put them
6622720	6629200	out like I would have thought for sure there was a compilation on CD. But I guess, or DVD or
6629280	6637920	whatever of those Sonic games. I guess there wasn't. But um, what is that called? I'm looking
6637920	6642720	up right now. Was it the Sonic mega collection? Well, there's that that's available on GameCube,
6642720	6649280	and that has everything. But what was the mega Genesis?
6650560	6654400	Yeah, it was something like something Genesis collection. I don't remember what it's called.
6654400	6661120	Sorry for the silence. But I'm trying to remember what this is called.
6661840	6667360	Like ultimate Genesis or Sonic. It's just called the Sega Genesis collection. Okay,
6667360	6673200	that's that's what I'm looking for. Or Sega Genesis classics. So let me look Sega
6673200	6683360	Genesis classics ps4 game list. So if you pick up this Sega Genesis classics,
6684640	6692160	on ps4, it has Sonic and Sonic two, it just doesn't have Sonic three.
6693120	6700960	But it has 3d blast and spinball in it as well. So and I think that I remember it coming up that
6700960	6707760	maybe the music with Sonic three has been an issue in the past. But yeah. So anyway, also pointing
6707760	6712320	out the Sonic ultimate Genesis collection didn't have the lock on feature. Oh, is that the one on
6712320	6722480	ps3? Sorry, I'm looking up things live as we're going. Okay, yeah, the Sonic ultimate Genesis
6722480	6729040	collection was the one that was on ps3 and Xbox 360. And that has one, two and three.
6731040	6738480	And it has Sonic and Knuckles. So I bet you could find that game used pretty cheap right now until
6738480	6743360	people realize it's true value that it has all those Sonic games in it. I think I have this on
6743360	6748160	PlayStation three hanging out around somewhere. It's a bummer. I can't fucking play PlayStation
6748160	6756880	three games on my ps4 or PlayStation five. So you can play some of them, but you have to buy
6756880	6761200	them again. Well, and this one won't be one that you can buy again, I guarantee it why would Sega
6761200	6765360	put that out when they've got this other Sonic thing they want people to buy now. So I would
6765920	6772480	the Xbox 360 version of this is really the must have thing I would say. Oh, de drama as says you
6772480	6776880	got a PS five No, not yet. I'm speaking out of turn a little bit. It's just that with Final
6776880	6783120	Fantasy 16 likely releasing in the next year. It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of you know,
6783120	6788160	when I finally tell call call Shane and say, Shane, I need you to work your target inventory
6788640	6795840	magic and make me get a PS five. So Oh, Bobby Blackwell says it's not backwards compatible on
6795840	6804880	Xbox one. Oh, sneaky sneaky. So you really just have to have a 360 to play this. Interesting.
6807680	6808800	Greedy, greedy, greedy.
6810240	6817040	Aren't I guess I'll just the wide graphic thing really worth that much. And and why no Sonic four
6817120	6824800	as if I had to ask. It wasn't good. But why no Sonic for my then why not just throw it in.
6827040	6833600	Anyway. All right. Uh, that is gonna do it for another episode of orange launch radio. Thank you
6833600	6839920	so much for tuning into our show and supporting the show. Whether you were here live over at
6839920	6844320	twitch.tv slash a vog network on Sunday night, or you were listening on our podcast three feed
6844320	6849600	throughout the week. Thank you so much for supporting our show. As Jonah Matt says the
6849600	6857280	Sonic four is a DLC that's going to be another $30. Yeah. And did your MS says retail stores
6857280	6862960	can get them in stock for 24 hours now. Yeah, I think we've heard rumblings that the chip shortage
6862960	6869200	is on its way out. And just most people who wanted a PS five that badly have finally gotten one by
6869200	6874160	now. So it's, you know, just don't support the resellers. That's the most important thing.
6875120	6879440	Anyway, where was I? Yes, if you enjoyed the show, help us spread the word. We are the show where
6879440	6884160	every gamer has a voice but we need more voices here to put out on air. A nice five star review
6884160	6888880	on a site site like iTunes or Spotify or Google, whatever, wherever you found this podcast,
6889440	6893280	give it a rating and a nice review. Believe me, it goes a long way. I don't think anyone's written
6893280	6898400	an iTunes review for the show in like three years. So if you haven't written written one yet,
6898400	6904640	we'd really appreciate it. Thank you. That's that's all I can think of. Join our discussions
6904640	6910720	throughout the week at vognetwork.com slash discord. I guess that's it. That's all I've got
6910720	6915600	to say. Let's go around and get final thoughts. Loki, what's your final thought for this week?
6916560	6924880	I gotta go play more Minecraft. I'll try to play something else to 200,000 blocks you amateur go
6924880	6931200	for 300,000 next time. I know I need to prove your love of Minecraft because I'm doubting you
6931200	6937440	right now. You're right. I gotta prove everybody. My final thought I'll just give a cheap plug to
6937440	6941280	my personal Twitch channel over at Rob Roberts because we've had some fun Final Fantasy 14
6941280	6947200	streams. I've almost hit two of the three criteria to be a partner. If I stream tomorrow,
6947200	6953040	which I probably will unless I have an IRL thing come up, I will have the 25 hours and I will have
6953040	6957360	the whatever it is however many streams you need in a month 12 or something like that. I will have
6957360	6963280	both of those. I just won't have the 75 average viewers. So I'm a little ways away from that. But
6963280	6971120	hey, every every view counts. Thank you over at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, my personal channel.
6971120	6975680	And of course twitch.tv slash vog network is where you can find us live on Sunday nights.
6975680	6979520	And I see that we just got a hype train here at the end of the show. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
6979520	6984000	you. I'll give you all your credits here after the credits. But let's get to those credits. We'll
6984000	6988160	see you in seven days. Hopefully the gang's all back together next week because it will literally
6988160	6992800	have been a month. But we're excited to have Dark Soccer Loki and myself all together again in a
6992800	6999840	week. Have a great night everybody. We'll see you next time. Good night. You've been listening to
