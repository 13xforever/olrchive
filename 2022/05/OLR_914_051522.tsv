0	30000	Since Reggie Fils-Aime departed Nintendo, he's been shattering the dreams of many fandoms. Yours truly was gutted, but not surprised to hear that Nintendo doesn't see the value in investing in Mother 3, the Game Boy Advance sequel to Mother 2, known in the West as Earthbound. The good news is, this is only what he knows about since his time at Nintendo. Feelings change, thoughts develop, and time keeps ticking. Oh, and tonight's story is about F-Zero. Put on your fandom dream
30000	60000	hardhats and tune in for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki as they discuss the story and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
60000	65000	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined via the magic of Discord by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
65000	66000	Hi.
66000	68000	Hello, hello. How are you doing?
68000	71000	Um, that's a loaded question.
71000	73000	Hope you're feeling better this week than last week.
73000	78000	My head is and then I probably broke my toe last night.
78000	82000	Oh, no. Alright, I want to talk about your weekend a little more in a minute.
82000	83000	More about that.
83000	85000	Of course I want to introduce Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki.
85000	86000	Hello.
86000	89000	Hi, what is the game playing behind you tonight live on Twitch?
89000	90000	That's weird.
90000	97000	Oh, here's here's my plug. I always do it because we do a tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network.
97000	102000	That's VOG network. Nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
102000	111000	Again, that's twitch.tv slash vog network where a lot of viewers tonight are surprised to find out that I have no hair under the hat.
111000	116000	So usually I wear a hat while we're doing the show. I'm not wearing one this week and everybody's like Rob looks different.
116000	120000	Yeah, because I'm not wearing a hat and you're like, oh, you have a very symmetrical head, Rob.
120000	125000	Well, actually, I would say the headphones really bring it out when I'm wearing these big old headphones.
125000	127000	They kind of bring that out.
127000	130000	I usually like being bald because I feel like it isn't symmetric.
130000	135000	But thank you. I know people who are very lumpy.
135000	136000	You don't you do not look lumpy.
136000	138000	Thank you. Thank you.
138000	141000	DJ Rama S and chat says Rob is a sexy Lex Luther.
141000	146000	Well, thank you. Except Lex Luther is what I've been calling the guy who just bought Twitter.
146000	148000	So I don't really want I don't want to be associated with that guy.
148000	152000	That guy's that guy's a piece of work. Anyway, Loki.
152000	156000	Remember who it was, though, that compared you to Vin Diesel.
156000	159000	But you know, that was on Twitter. Yeah. Yeah.
159000	161000	I would have been insulted.
161000	165000	I look at where that is not attractive.
165000	169000	I'm sorry. Well, somebody replied to my think.
169000	172000	So I posted a selfie and I was like, hi, bald.
172000	174000	And somebody replied to it, putting high graying.
174000	179000	And I was like, is that supposed to be shady? Because, A, you've never posted a selfie.
179000	182000	So if you want me to drag you, I'm happy to do it.
182000	187000	But B, I don't know, like Anderson Cooper's graying and he's kind of hot.
187000	189000	So like, what's wrong with graying? Gray's cool.
189000	192000	So great. Gray is we call that a silver fox.
192000	196000	Yes. Gray is a sign of intelligence and maturity.
196000	200000	Gray is a sign that your melanin levels have decreased in your hair follicles.
200000	204000	Anyway. Well, speaking of, you know, maturity.
204000	208000	Welcome to the video game show that we've been doing for coming up on 20 years next month.
208000	212000	And Loki, you look like you have a very mature game playing in the background behind you there.
212000	216000	What is that? It's like I know I've played this before and I can't remember the name of this.
216000	219000	It is. I didn't know what the picks.
219000	224000	So I just did arcade long plays and then I saw this on the list. It's ninja clowns.
224000	230000	I think this is one of those like main games I've played just for the name.
230000	235000	I was like, what the hell is this? And I played it for like five minutes and I was like, it's not very good.
235000	238000	All right. It appears to be a beat him up with clowns.
238000	243000	So that that sounds frightening and terrible unless you're the one beating up the clowns.
243000	245000	No, I don't even want to look at one.
245000	249000	I think it's like looks like you're a clown beating up other things.
249000	254000	Hmm. Interesting. Perhaps. All right. Let's talk about something that's a brighter topic.
254000	258000	Dark soccer. You were on a trip this weekend, right? Sort of.
258000	262000	Not really a trip. I mean, the place is 30 minutes away.
262000	265000	A jaunt, a skip, a hop and a skip.
265000	268000	So I was in Lodi. Yeah.
268000	270000	I know. What's in Lodi?
270000	273000	Lodi is where good wine comes from, though.
273000	281000	Well, anyway, speaking of wine, it was at the the Wine Festival Center or whatever they call it, their convention center.
281000	288000	But we had the triumphant return of Golden State Pinball Festival.
288000	294000	And I went on Friday for a good portion of it.
294000	300000	Friday is it starts later in the afternoon. So I went and played a bunch of stuff and hung out with Dan.
300000	312000	He was on the channel Elk Grove Pinball here on on Twitch and doing commentating on the the various tournaments that they were running.
312000	317000	He was actually on today's tournament and I kept hosting it.
317000	320000	But that was pretty that was pretty fun.
320000	333000	We went to a dinner also that night in memory of a member of the community and a friend of ours who died very suddenly this past year.
333000	337000	And his wife was there. And, you know, we she made cookies for everybody. It was nice.
337000	345000	I didn't eat them because they had raisins in them. But overall, I had a really good time.
345000	358000	I went again last night and I was supposed to be there today for the last day, except in doing my laundry and trying to kick the door open, I kicked the door frame.
358000	364000	And yeah, last night my my toe was was purple and swollen.
364000	369000	Today it is actually toe colored, but it's still pretty swollen.
369000	376000	And I had it had actually swollen into my rapping last night and it hurts so much.
376000	379000	So now I have it. I mean, what are you going to do for a broken toe?
379000	387000	You know, the doctors can say, OK, it's broken, immobilize it. Here's some drugs, except I can't take any of the drugs because of other stuff I'm on.
387000	393000	So I just I taped it. I put gauze around it to give it a cushion.
393000	399000	I taped the two toes together with Katie tape. I've taken Tylenol. I've taken a muscle relaxer. I'm good.
399000	408000	I'm not laughing at the fact you broke your toe because that sucks. But I'm laughing because my assumption was at some point during the weekend, you kicked a pinball machine or something.
408000	414000	I didn't think you were doing it with laundry or I thought, oh, maybe they had an ultra cayed machine there and she kicked it out of ceremony.
414000	417000	It was my pinky to Brad. It's no fun. That's no fun.
417000	421000	And actually, I think the one next to it, it was pretty, pretty tender, too.
421000	424000	But so I'm just going to keep him taped up and let him heal.
424000	442000	And but as but as a result, I didn't want to be on my foot all day playing pinball as much as I wanted to go back and play the star of the show, in my opinion, which was they had Weird Al's Museum of Natural Hilarity.
442000	452000	And I played a lot of it. I love it, except it has the same problem with P3 tables that it always has.
452000	457000	First of all, this one had the animatronic with the squeeze box and everything. It was really cool.
457000	467000	It is a very fun table with many, many modes. Like you actually when you hit a mode, you get to choose between two of them.
467000	474000	Like I did Weasel Stomping Day and and Harvey the Winter Hamster.
474000	480000	And then Dan got a choice between I'll sue you. And what was the other one?
480000	487000	He got word crimes, which I wish he had done word crimes, but whatever. And it was is really fun.
487000	504000	But my problem with P3 tables is that because it's a smoother surface, that it doesn't have the same drag that a traditional wooden playfield has, that sometimes the ball physics are affected weirdly.
504000	511000	Like the ball will sometimes move slower than I anticipated moving, and sometimes it will just move like lightning.
511000	523000	The other problem I have with P3 flippers, and this one was better than like when I played Lexi Lightspeed a while back, is that they seem to have a wider gap and a slight bit of a delay.
523000	534000	But now with this one, though, I don't know what they did, but they had, I guess, 3D printed an extension for the the flipper buttons and there were three buttons.
534000	539000	I only played with, you know, the ones I reached normally.
539000	547000	But I mean, it's got a very involved playfield for, you know, a P3. You've got, I mean, still you have that open...
547000	549000	Question from Chad on what a P3 is.
549000	555000	Oh, my apologies. So P3 is a modular pinball system.
555000	565000	So what it is, is you have an LCD screen inside that plays and interacts with your targets and various things.
565000	576000	The Weird Al one in particular, and I think, actually, I think all of them have this, have like these little raised areas that will come up between the video part of the playfield and the back end of the playfield.
576000	586000	And usually that's where like underpieces go, like for ball captures or different modes. Right.
586000	591000	But you can change out the parts on it and change the kit.
591000	600000	I guess it's like a board on it that you can change out and have it be a different table.
600000	611000	And these kits are, depending on like the base model itself is something like, I want to say eight grand.
611000	618000	And then you can get different kits for anywhere, I think between like three to seven.
618000	623000	And then we have, we were getting the Deluxe Weird Al machine.
623000	637000	So we also are getting an animatronic, but buying the machine, buying the kit, even with it installed in the animatronic edition is about twelve thousand dollars for us.
637000	642000	So we've sold tables to acquire it. It's very novel.
642000	646000	I mean, when we first saw it, we were sort of skeptical about it.
646000	649000	Oh, this won't really go anywhere.
649000	656000	They had another one that I didn't play called Valhalla. A lot of people spoke very highly of that.
656000	661000	I didn't play it because honestly, I was like, I'll play Weird Al. I'll play a lot of Weird Al.
661000	667000	But there's like, there's Lexi Lightspeed, there's Valhalla, there's Weird Al.
667000	673000	There is, there's another one that I can never think of.
673000	682000	I think it's like a Western themed one. And I always want to say that Total Heist is the other one.
682000	689000	And thank you, Bobby. And I always used to want to think that Total Nuclear Annihilation was one of them.
689000	697000	That's a completely different table that it was mean to me and I don't want to play it again.
697000	705000	But the Weird Al table is amazing. It even has Harvey the Wonder Hamster running in his little wheel.
705000	712000	And has the UHF cameras and everything and TV and all of just the little neat bits and pieces.
712000	719000	And so many call-outs. Like, you just hear Al talking the whole time.
719000	722000	And I didn't even hear everything he had to say.
722000	732000	And like, when you hit a drop target or something, it makes like a boiling or, you know, little comedic cartoony crashing noises and things like that.
732000	743000	It's very well thought out. I would say it's probably as well, if not better, thought out than many dedicated cabinets.
744000	754000	So, very well done. I put some stuff up on TikTok, I think, of me videoing ginging other people playing it.
754000	761000	And also me complaining about the guy that wouldn't shut up about playfield repair while I was doing multi-ball and Black Knight sort of rage.
761000	765000	Do not talk to me while I'm playing pinball. End of story.
765000	771000	Mr. Joe 100 Mountain Chat says, I was super jealous of Jamie's pinball pics when she was posting. It looked like a lot of fun.
771000	778000	Yeah, it looks like a fun event. I really should have gone. I didn't even know it was this weekend until I saw your tweet, retweets of your TikTok.
778000	783000	And I was like, oh, no, it was the picture of a long friend of mine from way back that you saw.
783000	784000	Oh, Amanda.
784000	788000	And then I was like, where did they run into each other? Did she go to the Bay Area this weekend?
788000	797000	And then I saw Amanda's Facebook that she was volunteering at the pinball thing and I was like, oh, of course, that's where.
797000	804000	And Dan said that she beelined for him to find me and I was coming in later in the day.
804000	807000	I actually ended up there a little bit later than I wanted to.
807000	810000	But I really should have gone if she was there.
811000	819000	Yeah, it was really good catching up with Amanda. I mean, it's been, gosh, I think like not long after her wedding.
819000	822000	That was a while ago.
822000	828000	A while ago. I mean, I think I saw her at a couple of other things, but it's been a while.
828000	832000	But I'm checking out my pictures real quick just so I can remember everything that I played.
832000	840000	I was I took another guy to their wedding because I was dating him at the time and Alan and I have been together for like 12 years.
840000	844000	So, yeah.
844000	848000	But I played Bride of Pinbot 2.0.
848000	850000	Do you know that is? Oh, yeah.
850000	856000	Yeah, I love I love the music in it and how they updated, you know, with the color DMD and everything.
856000	858000	It's it's very worthwhile.
858000	862000	I love the machine with the color dot matrix displays.
862000	877000	I didn't play their Twilight Zone because I own one, but someone had a modded back glass that was semi holographic or lenticular with glowing LEDs behind it.
877000	881000	I played Rush. I played a decent amount of Rush.
881000	885000	I actually played the auctioned version because the room was much quieter.
885000	890000	That was the room that had like the 60s and 70s pinball, including a Fritz the Cat one.
890000	893000	I didn't know that they did one. Oh, wow.
893000	899000	But it was fun to play that one because I couldn't hear the other ones.
899000	904000	I played Avengers. That one was pretty fun. But again, I couldn't hear it.
904000	914000	That's my weird TikTok video. I played Alien Star, which is a probably early 80s, late 70s.
914000	917000	It was when they started doing the digital.
917000	923000	Counters, I played Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, and that was fucking fun.
923000	930000	That was great. I loved it. I wanted the Rob Zombie one was right next to it and it looked great.
930000	937000	Had a deep playfield and everyone was just on top of it. I played a gladiator, which is a Gottlieb table.
937000	943000	I played the Pabst can crusher.
943000	945000	What the hell is that?
945000	946000	Like Pabst blue ribbon.
946000	950000	Wow. Okay. I had no idea that was the thing.
950000	961000	I also got a good picture of the rig they had set up for the tournament for a streaming pinball.
961000	968000	Oh, that's a picture of my key breaking off in the lock. That also happened.
968000	974000	I also played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It had lots of neat mods on it.
974000	982000	Just different figures and custom items. It was inside an inflatable tent.
982000	988000	It looks almost like a bounce house from the outside. Apparently this guy's son made this thing.
988000	996000	And then it was nice and cool inside to play Turtles. It was awesome. I'll put pictures up of that.
996000	1004000	I played Space Invaders pinball. I played Star Trek. I played Pac-Man.
1004000	1013000	I played this really weird game called Future Spa. It is definitely 60s, early 70s-ish aesthetic.
1013000	1016000	Was it all pinball there?
1017000	1018000	It was all pinball.
1018000	1023000	If you go to the Pinball Hall of Fame in Vegas, they still have a good collection of 80s and 90s arcade machines too.
1023000	1027000	One row is all that. But it was purely pinball, this thing.
1027000	1033000	Pure pinball. This year it was all pinball. I played the Incredible Hulk from the 70s.
1033000	1039000	I played, like I said, I played Bride of Pimbat. I played Transformers, the newer one. I bought a beer stein.
1041000	1045000	These are all private collectors that bring these in, basically, right?
1045000	1047000	Did you and Dan take any of yours?
1047000	1050000	And Stern. No, we didn't bring any of ours.
1050000	1059000	Stern brought in a bunch of demos. They brought in Godzilla, which I didn't play.
1059000	1066000	They brought in Avengers. They brought in Rush. They brought in...
1066000	1070000	There wasn't actually a big Jersey Jack showing, which actually surprised me a little bit.
1070000	1073000	I was hoping that Jersey Jack would have brought in some stuff.
1073000	1077000	I think the only of theirs I saw was a dialed in.
1077000	1082000	And there might have been the Lord of the Rings. I might have missed it.
1082000	1085000	But these are all the pictures of my food.
1085000	1088000	I was trying to see what else I played.
1088000	1094000	So many pictures of Weird Al. I was on that table like you would not believe.
1094000	1098000	Avengers Infinity Quest. Early next year, right?
1098000	1102000	I think mid next year, actually.
1103000	1108000	I also know that I played...
1108000	1111000	Oh, yeah. We were hoping that there would be Stranger Things.
1111000	1113000	And there wasn't.
1113000	1118000	But I did also play a machine that I used to own.
1118000	1121000	I used to own PENbot, Brighter PENbot, and Jackbot.
1121000	1123000	But we don't have those anymore.
1123000	1128000	So I spent a little bit of time with Jackbot, re-familiarizing myself.
1128000	1134000	Oh, and I played Munsters. The black and white Munsters deluxe that has the mini...
1134000	1138000	It's basically Grandpa's lab.
1138000	1142000	And it's a mini play field with a tiny little pinball.
1142000	1146000	And you play it and it's pretty fun.
1146000	1149000	If there's a version to have, there's that one.
1149000	1153000	But for other tables that they had there, they had a lot of...
1153000	1157000	Oh, yeah. I played the old Pac-Man one from the early 80s.
1157000	1160000	Which is not very good.
1160000	1165000	No baby Pac-Man. I looked.
1165000	1169000	That one's a weird one, though, because it's half video game, right?
1169000	1172000	So it lives in a weird place.
1172000	1176000	I played Sword of Fury, which honestly has amazing music.
1176000	1177000	That's cool.
1177000	1181000	It's around the same era as Black Knight 2000.
1181000	1189000	There's also several Black Knights, a Black Knight 2000 and a Black Knight Sword of Rage,
1189000	1191000	which is the one I got irritated playing.
1191000	1195000	For the tournaments, though, they had a World Cup soccer,
1195000	1198000	which actually belongs to a friend and coworker.
1198000	1201000	We didn't bring ours. There were no other World Cups out on the field.
1201000	1207000	And that was actually the one they did the finals for today's tournament.
1207000	1211000	And I felt bad because the ball kept sticking in this one place,
1211000	1215000	apparently like a wire or a rubber on it broke or something.
1215000	1220000	But they also had an Iron Maiden for that.
1220000	1223000	They had ACDC.
1223000	1227000	Godzilla was another one of the tournament tables.
1227000	1230000	I'd have to go back and think about it,
1230000	1236000	but they had a really diverse showing for the tournament tables.
1236000	1239000	Let me ask you this, because I know we want to get into the gaming news here,
1239000	1243000	but I'm curious how, because it's been a couple of years,
1243000	1246000	because obviously COVID shut down things for a while,
1246000	1248000	how well attended did it seem to you?
1248000	1251000	Did it seem like people were ready for this to be back?
1251000	1252000	Yeah.
1252000	1256000	The thing, though, that I liked, and it was actually by necessity,
1256000	1261000	is that the floor outlets in,
1261000	1265000	because basically the convention center has a huge gymnasium area,
1265000	1267000	and then another convention room,
1267000	1271000	and then a smaller convention room where the tourney was,
1271000	1276000	but the big gym area and the other room, the medium-sized room,
1276000	1279000	the floor outlets couldn't handle four tables.
1279000	1282000	So they actually put the tables around the outside walls
1282000	1285000	and then a couple of lines of them.
1285000	1290000	And for me, well, and for the ones they could get on those multi-outlets,
1290000	1294000	they had them spread out in such a way that I think that it was honestly
1294000	1296000	about as safe as it could get.
1296000	1299000	And there were people masked, there were people not masked,
1299000	1302000	you know, kind of a mix.
1302000	1305000	They were more unmasked than masked, and of course when I got,
1305000	1308000	actually this morning I took a test and it came back negative.
1308000	1314000	So, but it was pretty well attended.
1314000	1317000	Maybe not as much as I've seen there for the past shows,
1317000	1323000	but people were ready for it, and they didn't have a big vending presence.
1323000	1328000	I mean, Marco Pinball's was there, and a few people doing pinball parts,
1328000	1333000	and I think the pinball room was there.
1333000	1340000	And then Stern has the Stern Insider thing now where you have a barcode,
1340000	1345000	and anyone can sign up for it, but they have a barcode scanner on,
1345000	1348000	not a barcode, but a QR code scanner on the table.
1348000	1351000	And if the owner of that table has registered it,
1351000	1356000	then you scan the QR code from your phone,
1356000	1359000	and it tracks your scores on the leaderboard.
1359000	1360000	That's cool.
1360000	1363000	So that is really, that was a smart way to incorporate it.
1363000	1366000	It's neat to see that modern stuff that pinball's doing to really stay,
1366000	1368000	you know, because I know it's video games here at OLR,
1368000	1370000	but pinball is super adjacent to that,
1370000	1374000	and I think a lot of people have that cross interest and so forth,
1374000	1378000	and I think it's neat to see because, you know, whereas we've seen arcades,
1378000	1381000	I think, really regress for many of us,
1381000	1385000	because we all joke that arcades are nothing but ticket-spitting machines
1385000	1387000	teaching kids how to gamble these days.
1387000	1391000	You know, arcades, from what we remember and what we miss,
1391000	1397000	you know, they're pretty garbage, but pinball feels like it's still a thing.
1397000	1398000	It's still there.
1398000	1401000	It's still in bars and, you know, a lot of coin-op arcades,
1401000	1403000	you know, throughout the country and so forth,
1403000	1405000	it's still able to kind of progress in these different ways.
1405000	1406000	It's pretty cool.
1406000	1410000	And then obviously, you know, people have a lot of love for shows like this.
1410000	1412000	I bought you a mug.
1412000	1416000	Oh, what about, I can't wait to see it, what about like California Extreme?
1416000	1418000	Speaking of upcoming shows, is that still a thing?
1418000	1419000	Is that coming back?
1419000	1421000	The organizer of California Extreme was there.
1421000	1422000	Oh, nice.
1422000	1427000	And I also met a lady who was staffing here,
1427000	1432000	who also staffs for California Extreme, and it's definitely happening.
1433000	1435000	With my luck, I'll be hosting a show that weekend.
1435000	1439000	Oh, July 30th and 31st is when it is.
1439000	1440000	Yeah.
1440000	1441000	Oh, tentative date.
1441000	1442000	That's interesting.
1442000	1443000	They still don't have that locked down.
1443000	1444000	Interesting.
1444000	1450000	Well, I think that, honestly, I think it is locked, from what I understand.
1450000	1454000	Maybe with COVID cases going up in the bay, they're still a little skittish.
1454000	1455000	Yeah.
1455000	1457000	I think that's it.
1457000	1458000	But...
1458000	1461000	Anyway, before we get to kickoff news,
1461000	1465000	any other quick wrap up thoughts on the pinball thing?
1465000	1470000	We had, there were people actually from all over that were there.
1470000	1474000	One of the tournament players drove down from Boise.
1474000	1481000	We had one of our Reno buddies win the novice tournament.
1481000	1484000	We had players from San Francisco.
1484000	1490000	We had people come from all over to come to this convention.
1490000	1492000	It's a beautiful Lodi.
1492000	1493000	Whoa.
1493000	1499000	Lodi is kind of picturesque in that we're a small town.
1499000	1502000	It's still considered just part of Sacramento, I think.
1502000	1503000	Well, okay.
1503000	1504000	Well, here's the thing.
1504000	1505000	Here's the thing.
1505000	1509000	One of the most famous people from Sacramento, they just named a park after him.
1509000	1510000	They gave him a star.
1510000	1511000	LeVar Burton, right?
1511000	1513000	One of the most famous people from Sacramento.
1513000	1515000	An actual living legend.
1515000	1516000	Amazing actor, right?
1516000	1518000	He's really from Gull.
1518000	1519000	But it's...
1519000	1520000	Yeah.
1520000	1521000	They just say Sacramento.
1521000	1523000	He's really from Galt, but they just say Sacramento.
1523000	1524000	That's where Galt is.
1524000	1527000	Like you sneeze driving to Lodi and Galt's missing.
1527000	1528000	Yeah, Galt between Lodi and Sac.
1528000	1533000	But anyway, I'm not going to bore our international audience with local geography.
1533000	1537000	And where I live, it really was like a 20 to 30 minute drive, depending on the traffic.
1537000	1538000	Yeah.
1538000	1540000	It wasn't bad at all.
1540000	1548000	And, you know, it was really good just reconnecting with people that I haven't seen in a while.
1548000	1550000	And Dan said people were surprised to see me.
1550000	1554000	I mean, I know I'm pretty much the recluse when it comes.
1554000	1560000	I don't go to the pinball tournaments because I was either working or streaming or to league
1560000	1561000	nights.
1561000	1567000	And honestly, that's a lot of people in small places, especially when it's at my house.
1567000	1573000	But, you know, I'm also not competitive that way.
1573000	1577000	So I don't really care about being in a competitive environment.
1577000	1582000	But I like I generally genuinely like most of the people.
1582000	1591000	And also Dan's co-host for the Spinner is Lit podcast, which is the podcast that he's
1591000	1592000	on.
1592000	1598000	Spencer, he and his wife, Rusty, moved out of state, but they came back for this.
1599000	1605000	So we got to see Spencer and Rusty and got to see all kinds of just, you know, it was
1605000	1610000	the reconnection, the pinball community in and of itself.
1610000	1614000	It's just really a.
1614000	1622000	I don't know, it's very different than I guess your standard arcade communities and that
1622000	1630000	it's somewhat competitive feeling, but also when you're done, there's not really hard
1630000	1631000	feelings.
1631000	1634000	And then if there are hard feelings, they fade pretty quickly.
1634000	1641000	I mean, the various drama, there is drama in our local community, but most of the time,
1641000	1644000	people are just like, just hang in and chill.
1644000	1648000	It reminds me of what this show is founded on the DDR community, like a lot of what you
1648000	1651000	just said can be said about the DDR community that, you know, at tournaments and stuff,
1651000	1652000	people are cool.
1652000	1654000	Like, you know, it's like, OK, a different person won.
1654000	1655000	It's whatever.
1655000	1658000	But then there were certain individuals within it that were very dramatic.
1658000	1662000	And, you know, of all about the drama, the drama llamas, you know, and all that.
1662000	1668000	But for the most part, like, you know, obviously this show exists because of that community.
1668000	1670000	And even though we've all moved on from it.
1670000	1672000	Well, because the community died.
1672000	1677000	You know, now it's now to be fair for somebody, you know, reacts to what I just said.
1677000	1682000	I realized that newer Konami efforts in the arcade has kind of brought the the Bahmani
1682000	1684000	and music game scene back.
1684000	1688000	But I think people need to understand that since we started the show in 2002, there was
1688000	1694000	that real gap between the time Extreme came out and Supernova came out that, you know,
1694000	1699000	Konami killed Bahmani for a lot of people, you know, in that kind of drought time.
1699000	1701000	So it took a long time for it to come back, I think.
1701000	1704000	So, you know, I'm just saying the DDR community died.
1705000	1708000	News reborn as we were reborn.
1708000	1713000	That's different now because of the pandemic, because Discord brings people together instead
1713000	1714000	of DDR freak.
1714000	1716000	Just different, you know.
1716000	1717000	Yeah.
1717000	1723000	So honestly, for me, Twitch is like my old AOL chat.
1723000	1727000	I mean, seriously, I was I mean, that's how I met Dan.
1727000	1733000	So actually, it's how I met a number of my Bahmani friends before.
1733000	1737000	Like, I was playing BM 98 on a Windows 3.1 machine.
1737000	1740000	Are you saying if I had been on AOL instead of Prodigy?
1740000	1745000	Are you saying if I've been on AOL that no matter what chat room I decided to go to,
1745000	1747000	you would be in there already chatting?
1747000	1749000	Because that's what happens on Twitch.
1749000	1750000	No matter what.
1750000	1754000	The thing is, you would probably have ended up in the same circles because that's just
1754000	1758000	where all of the video game anime nerds went to.
1758000	1759000	I don't know.
1759000	1765000	A lot of my gay friends say that AOL for them was very different.
1765000	1770000	And I never experienced any of that because I didn't figure things out until a little
1770000	1771000	later in life.
1771000	1776000	And we had moved on to the internet was out.
1776000	1777000	Gay.com.
1777000	1780000	Anyway, let's move on quickly.
1780000	1782000	Let's get into another.
1782000	1785000	Thank you for the wrap up at the gaming expo, the pinball expo.
1785000	1786000	Makes me jealous.
1786000	1791000	And I think I want to go to California extreme because July 30th, I was just looking at that
1791000	1792000	for an Ingress event.
1792000	1796000	But the Ingress event is in Germany and a plane ticket to Germany.
1796000	1797000	Are you not going to drive to Germany?
1797000	1799000	Yeah, I'm going to drive to Germany, Logie.
1799000	1801000	A plane ticket to Germany right now.
1801000	1804000	I was like, oh, maybe it's like $1,600.
1804000	1806000	I was like, never mind.
1806000	1809000	I'll just not do that event.
1809000	1812000	And I will just do something else.
1812000	1816000	So anyway, we'll do California extreme maybe.
1816000	1817000	All right.
1817000	1819000	But let's get into some news.
1819000	1820000	It's interesting.
1820000	1825000	I just brought up DDR and the good old days and Konami because there's a lot of great
1825000	1829000	Konami stuff from the good old days, lots of franchises.
1829000	1835000	And honestly, I don't think any of them are ever going to come back as good as they were.
1835000	1836000	I don't know.
1836000	1841000	A lot of people speak fondly of Bomberman and people speak fondly of the Castlevania
1841000	1848000	collections, which are fine, but they're literally just ports of good games.
1848000	1851000	You know, they're just they're just ports of good games.
1851000	1854000	I have concerns about where this next one is going.
1854000	1861000	Logie, would you like to talk about the latest that the rumor that won't die, but somebody
1861000	1863000	put gasoline on the fire this week?
1863000	1864000	Yeah.
1864000	1872000	So there is a well-known leaker by the name of Dusk Golem had shared some images of what's
1872000	1875000	supposed to be a Silent Hill game.
1875000	1877000	It looks like concept art.
1877000	1885000	And then, of course, you know, normally we would just say, oh, yeah, of course.
1885000	1886000	Yeah, sure.
1886000	1887000	Silent Hill.
1887000	1892000	But then Konami cease and desisted it and took it off the Internet.
1893000	1899000	So, of course, you know, the Internet, yes, basically confirming it to the entire Internet,
1899000	1902000	this little this little thing we call the Streisand effect.
1902000	1903000	Right.
1903000	1904000	We all know the Streisand effect.
1904000	1908000	For those that have not heard the term before, you might think, why did they name something
1908000	1909000	after Barbra Streisand?
1909000	1915000	Because she had pictures of her house taken, like from an airplane or something like that.
1915000	1916000	I don't know.
1916000	1918000	Paparazzi flew over her house, took pictures.
1918000	1923000	She sued the website or whatever was the magazine or whatever, trying to get the pictures
1923000	1924000	taken down.
1924000	1930000	And the pictures were removed, but not before they were spread and published everywhere
1930000	1931000	on the Internet.
1931000	1933000	Because, you know, you know how it goes.
1933000	1934000	Tigerclaw just said it in chat.
1934000	1937000	Once it's on the Internet, it stays on the Internet.
1937000	1939000	And absolutely true for the Silent Hill League.
1939000	1945000	But you see, Konami isn't run by competent people anymore.
1945000	1947000	That is that is a fact.
1947000	1948000	I'm sorry.
1948000	1949000	That is a fact.
1949000	1951000	Konami is not run by competent people anymore.
1951000	1957000	And before you start to go, but the arcade scene, OK, the arcade division is different
1957000	1964000	from this this rotting husk zombie of what used to be K-Set and the home entertainment
1964000	1965000	division.
1965000	1967000	OK, that is a fucking disaster.
1967000	1968000	And I'm sorry.
1968000	1971000	That is fact, because I'm just going to point at this E football.
1971000	1973000	I'm just going to point at E football.
1973000	1974000	Fat.
1974000	1979000	I'm going to point at that hard contra, whatever that game was called, contra hardcore.
1979000	1982000	It was called fat bomber man.
1982000	1983000	OK, maybe less of a fact.
1983000	1985000	But how many years ago was that at this point?
1985000	1991000	Like reading more recent like examples that like Konami making games for the whole is
1991000	1995000	is like this is not good news.
1995000	2000000	That's that Konami is making a new Silent Hill unless unless and this is the only way
2000000	2001000	I'm going to get excited about it.
2001000	2002000	They've roped somebody else.
2002000	2005000	They gave the intellectual property to somebody else.
2005000	2007000	But Konami is still the one that shut it down.
2007000	2009000	So I'm a little worried about that.
2009000	2012000	It's outsourcing it to Kojima.
2012000	2017000	I doubt that they already think they know who's doing it, but I'll let I'll let Loki
2017000	2018000	finish.
2018000	2019000	Sorry.
2019000	2020000	Yeah.
2020000	2021000	So.
2021000	2029000	Yeah, I don't I don't think Kojima would be doing that kind of stuff.
2029000	2034000	I don't know if we know who's actually working on this, but it looks interesting.
2034000	2036000	It doesn't look like a Silent Hill game.
2036000	2039000	I mean, like anything I've seen for Silent Hill game right now.
2039000	2045000	So I believe the studio is blooper or something like that.
2045000	2051000	What's the no, it's not blooper.
2051000	2054000	Somebody in chat saved me here.
2054000	2058000	That there's they think they know what studio is working on.
2058000	2061000	It's been it's been talked about before.
2061000	2062000	Blooper.
2062000	2063000	I was close.
2063000	2064000	Blooper.
2064000	2065000	Yeah.
2065000	2068000	Blooper is the team that's rumored to be working on it.
2068000	2070000	I'm trying to see what else it is they did.
2070000	2072000	I think they were the ones that did the Blair Witch reboot.
2072000	2074000	Yeah, they did Blair Witch.
2074000	2078000	They did the medium observer layers of fear.
2078000	2085000	So they media the medium certainly looks like, you know, they've done other OK, scary games.
2085000	2086000	Well, the medium.
2086000	2089000	I mean, that was the one that everyone was convinced was a Silent Hill game originally.
2089000	2093000	So, I mean, they can certainly nail the style.
2093000	2094000	True.
2094000	2102000	And what was interesting, too, about the leak is that a lot of folks noticed that it was a lot of British terms that were on like the little Post-it notes.
2102000	2107000	And people are thinking that if it's a reboot, it's potentially like a Europe Silent Hill.
2107000	2113000	Whereas most of this, in fact, I think all of the Silent Hill that we've seen today is, you know, America based.
2113000	2118000	It was all the whole thing was based off a coal town in Virginia.
2118000	2121000	So like that, you know, still smolders after all these years.
2121000	2126000	And so it'd be interesting if they move it to a British kind of location.
2126000	2128000	But it's an interesting way to reboot it.
2128000	2131000	So I don't I don't I feel nothing about that.
2131000	2133000	OK, it's just show me the game.
2133000	2142000	But what's interesting about it is it seems like there's like a bullying theme to it because like the little pieces of paper that are ripped away in her face, like one of them says, I hate myself.
2142000	2150000	And then you see in all the Post-it notes that are decorated the hallway, it says something like, you know, like, you know, just just bully like you're fat.
2150000	2153000	You know, things things like bully terms that they'd say.
2153000	2158000	And so people think it could involve like a bullying thing.
2158000	2160000	So I don't know.
2160000	2165000	I mean, we'll see what we see whenever they decide they actually want to reveal this.
2165000	2168000	But them taking down these images just confirmed it.
2168000	2176000	So a new Silent Hill game is or was and that's important to is or was being worked on.
2176000	2179000	There's no guarantee it'll see the light of day. Hello, P.T.
2179000	2182000	But it seems it's even actually Silent Hill.
2182000	2188000	Yeah, or yeah, or even actually turns into an actual Silent Hill game. Very true.
2188000	2190000	Loud Mountain, who knows? No, I don't know.
2190000	2194000	So Loud Mountain be Loud Valley if you're going for opposite.
2194000	2196000	OK, fair enough. Loud Valley.
2196000	2200000	So, yeah, we'll see.
2200000	2210000	I don't know, but it's it seems like it's happening and it's just going to now, you know, if it ends up being a Sony exclusive or whatever, it just really amps up the pressure on Sony.
2210000	2214000	I don't know. I say that, but it's like Sony could do whatever they want when it comes to announcements.
2214000	2217000	Like if they announce it, great. If they don't, whatever.
2218000	2221000	Because I think a lot of us are just like sick of talking about Silent Hill.
2221000	2226000	Like it's been literally how many years since the P.T. demo?
2226000	2231000	Like the P.T. demo is just about eligible to be a classic game of the week, I believe. It's been a long time.
2231000	2237000	So I think people are just kind of like sick of speculating a Silent Hill game and it's like just just come out already.
2237000	2242000	So I think the last Silent Hill games were 10 years ago.
2242000	2245000	I think Downpour was 2012 and the HD collection.
2245000	2252000	So which speaking of a disaster anyway.
2252000	2256000	All right. Other comments from chat.
2256000	2260000	Dr. Seuss says that's where I'm at. If they outsourced it to someone competent, it could be good.
2260000	2266000	Yeah. I mean, when the talk was Hideo Kojima was somehow back and involved, that was very exciting.
2266000	2274000	But now that was never going to be their team putting it together because they don't have a competent team at that company.
2274000	2280000	No, that's very true. Tiger class says it's unfortunate Konami is sitting on a bunch of IPs and doing nothing with them.
2280000	2284000	Yeah, pretty much. I mean, rereleasing the hits.
2284000	2291000	That's that's what they're doing right now. They're rereleasing the hits because when it comes to the Castlevania collection, the arcade collection.
2291000	2296000	Now we have the Ninja Turtles collection that's coming. That is very it's that's pretty much a Konami thing, right?
2296000	2303000	It's pretty much all their games that came out. They're just rehashing the hits. They're repackaging the oldies.
2303000	2306000	Repackaging the hits. Yeah, exactly.
2306000	2311000	So I don't I don't know what it'll do, what what they can do to do something new.
2311000	2320000	But anyway, we'll see. We'll see where this leads. Let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether it was the hits or something new.
2320000	2327000	Dark Soccer, I know you pretty much already talked about the Pinball Fest, but I'm sure there were some other video games in there you played too, right? How was your gaming week?
2327000	2329000	I started Terranigma.
2329000	2331000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2331000	2339000	It's so slow to start. It was so slow. I got so bored, but I made it past the towers.
2339000	2342000	And so I think it's going to be a lot more interesting now.
2343000	2350000	Of course, I did forgo my stream last night for more Terranigma and Friday for, you know, where I was gonna play more Dead by Daylight.
2350000	2352000	There's today I did play Dead by Daylight.
2352000	2363000	Make sure if you are playing the game that you log in every day to get your 66,666 blood points for the upcoming anniversary.
2363000	2365000	Did you see the leaks?
2365000	2373000	I did see the leaks about Locker Guy and the new survivor with none of the dredge.
2373000	2375000	None of them had good perks.
2375000	2376000	Hattie.
2376000	2384000	But the thing about her that makes me interested is she appeared in lore for years.
2385000	2396000	She and the guy, Jordan, that you could see on the written paper, both of them were referenced in four different tomes.
2396000	2398000	Going back, I think, to Tome 3.
2398000	2402000	Well, and the dredge is in the doctor's stuff, right?
2402000	2410000	The dredge's backstory is that it was actually formed by the negativity from a particular village or something.
2410000	2413000	There was a personification of the negativity of the internet.
2413000	2415000	Because you could make a lot of killers out of that.
2415000	2416000	Yikes.
2416000	2420000	It's basically all the salty survivors, you know, complaining about NoEd.
2420000	2421000	Yeah.
2421000	2423000	Yeah, you bring NoEd.
2423000	2425000	I don't know, why do you bring Dead Hard, bitch?
2425000	2438000	Anyway, by the way, I don't know if anyone in the DVD fandom follows Samination, Disney's animated Dead by Daylight parodies.
2438000	2440000	The last one is on point.
2440000	2444000	On point about annoying survivors.
2444000	2446000	I'll leave it there.
2446000	2451000	Also, they had the British lady who does the nurse and calls everyone a twat.
2451000	2453000	I love her.
2453000	2456000	Alright, back to my gaming week.
2456000	2461000	I've done wordscapes and a shitload of pinball.
2461000	2464000	And yeah, that's it.
2464000	2466000	Alright, good enough.
2466000	2468000	Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?
2468000	2470000	All Minecraft again.
2470000	2471000	Sorry.
2471000	2473000	No, you're just working on new videos, right?
2473000	2474000	Yeah, new videos.
2474000	2477000	I put out a video yesterday.
2477000	2479000	Yeah, so I put out a video yesterday.
2479000	2484000	And then just working on more stuff for that.
2484000	2490000	Probably just gonna build more farms and stuff to take a break from building buildings.
2490000	2492000	But yeah, it's been going well.
2492000	2493000	Alright, good.
2493000	2494000	My gaming week.
2494000	2496000	I've also been playing a lot of the same stuff.
2496000	2499000	I did a couple nights streaming Final Fantasy XIV on my personal stream.
2499000	2502000	Shane joined me for a lot of random adventures.
2502000	2504000	He was trying to teach me some of the new raids.
2504000	2506000	So we did a few of the new 8-man fights.
2506000	2510000	We were gonna finish up, but he has family in town this week.
2510000	2513000	So we'll probably have to finish those other two fights later in the week or something.
2513000	2515000	We'll see.
2515000	2516000	And then I've also been playing.
2516000	2517000	I played Dead by Daylight.
2517000	2518000	I've been on a little bit of a break.
2518000	2521000	I haven't played a lot lately, so I think that was good to kind of take a little break.
2521000	2524000	And I was logging in to get my 66,000 blood points.
2524000	2526000	I was like, eh, I'll fire up a match or two.
2526000	2527000	And I was actually having a good time.
2527000	2530000	I've been playing more Killer again, which is interesting, because I was doing a lot
2530000	2531000	of Survivor for a bit.
2531000	2533000	But I was like, oh, Killer's fun.
2533000	2539000	I still really love to play the Onryo or the girl, Sadako from The Ring.
2539000	2546000	But I'm not, like, I can feel that I'm not as good with her as I am with, like, probably Wraith.
2546000	2550000	I just think, I actually don't really care for Wraith as a Killer,
2550000	2557000	but, like, he's really, like, a good base, basic Killer, basically, you know, the cloaking mechanic.
2557000	2561000	His whole thing is turning invisible and, you know, hiding from Survivors and stuff.
2561000	2564000	So I've been, yeah, I've been playing that.
2564000	2565000	Ding, ding.
2565000	2566000	Yep.
2566000	2571000	Oh, no, I always use that add-on where the ding, ding, you hear it across the whole map.
2571000	2572000	Like, it doesn't matter where you are.
2572000	2576000	You hear the dings everywhere, so you never know if he's next to you or not.
2576000	2583000	I was, some people actually take the thing from the Samination of their Wraith going, ding, ding, bitches.
2583000	2585000	I'll have to show you that, but yeah.
2585000	2591000	And then, I'm going to be honest, something I haven't played around with in a long time is emulators.
2591000	2593000	I'm going to be just completely transparent.
2593000	2599000	I fell down this rabbit hole of, I've never really explored RetroArch as an emulator before,
2599000	2608000	but I just had this bug where I was like, I want to see if I can, like, get Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix from PlayStation 1.
2608000	2610000	I'm like, my computer ought to emulate PlayStation 1 games.
2610000	2611000	Allen Computer does it.
2611000	2612000	I don't know, I've never done it.
2612000	2620000	I'm going to, so I fell down this rabbit hole of getting RetroArch installed, getting the core installed, and playing Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix.
2620000	2628000	And I even got the, I even figured out how to do the disc swap to, like, second club append and all that stuff, which was fun.
2628000	2630000	And yeah, just a lot of stuff that I missed.
2630000	2632000	So I was playing some DDR stuff.
2632000	2636000	Yeah, DarkTitius says, I know DDR PlayStation is tough to emulate because of the timing.
2636000	2641000	Yeah, I noticed one core would get the timing way off compared to another one.
2641000	2643000	So yeah, there's that.
2643000	2647000	Bobby says, RetroArch is great, but the people who develop RetroArch aren't the best.
2647000	2650000	Oh no, don't ruin it for me.
2650000	2651000	Oh, there's drama.
2651000	2656000	Well, I thought it was open source though, because I felt like there's all these cores.
2656000	2661000	And I recognized the Atari 2600 one was Stella, and that emulator's been around forever.
2661000	2666000	So I figured a lot of it was open source or whatever, so interesting.
2666000	2668000	So that's where I started.
2668000	2680000	I'm not saying that's the end all, be all the emulators, but I was just having a good time finding old rhythm games and playing in an emulator since, you know, I can't play them any other.
2681000	2686000	I think I need to be open and talking about this as much as, you know, I don't agree with piracy and so forth.
2686000	2687000	I could lend you a PlayStation.
2687000	2688000	Well, how else am I supposed to play?
2688000	2689000	Well, okay, so fine.
2689000	2692000	I could get an old PlayStation that still works.
2692000	2696000	But the reality is like, I can't play these on my PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5.
2696000	2702000	You know, I can't even get them on the cloud because of all the music licensing and stuff.
2702000	2707000	So it's like, I see it as game preservation and getting to revisit a period of my life that I really enjoyed.
2707000	2713000	I would be happy to buy any new DDR game that they put out on PlayStation 4 or 5.
2713000	2715000	I've bought them all.
2715000	2718000	So, you know, anyway.
2718000	2722000	Sacred Jade said no PS2 or PS3.
2722000	2723000	No, I didn't get that far.
2723000	2725000	I have a PS3.
2725000	2727000	I have a Japanese PS2 I can lend you.
2727000	2729000	Well, no, I actually still have a Japanese PS2.
2729000	2738000	I don't know if it works or not, but my PS3 doesn't play PS2 games.
2738000	2740000	I guess it would play PS1 games, though.
2740000	2747000	But anyway, I only have room to hook up so many systems on my TV and I don't know if the PS2 works anymore, to be honest.
2747000	2751000	Doesn't the PS3 also adhere to the region locking?
2751000	2752000	Yeah, there's that too.
2752000	2754000	So that's an issue.
2755000	2763000	When we were doing endings, for example, we were swapping out the endings to watch all the Tekken endings.
2763000	2768000	And our Tekken 1 and Tekken 2 are American, but my Tekken 3 is Japanese.
2768000	2771000	So, just throwing that out there.
2771000	2775000	Once we switched to the Tekken 3 disc, we couldn't switch back.
2776000	2782000	Once I had the emulator up and running, then I was like, oh, I want to play some old Atari 2600 stuff.
2782000	2784000	Because I have a bunch of, you know, dumb 2600 games.
2784000	2786000	I think we all do. They're so small.
2786000	2788000	Like, you know, it's so easy to go back and visit them.
2788000	2789000	There was a story going around.
2789000	2792000	I don't think it's in tonight's show, so I'll just bring it up.
2792000	2794000	Because Bobby had retweeted it and it caught my eye.
2794000	2806000	And it was that they tracked down the programmer who made the first Atari 2600 game and first video game that had a woman as the lead character that you could play as.
2806000	2807000	It was a game called Wabbit.
2807000	2808000	W-A-B-B-I-T.
2808000	2810000	And it was a woman who made it.
2810000	2814000	And because of a misspelling, they lost track of her for years and years.
2814000	2819000	But this website found her and did a whole little article on it and on that game called Wabbit.
2819000	2823000	So I kind of had, you know, a bug to go play Wabbit.
2823000	2825000	Because I thought the article was very well done.
2825000	2830000	I thought she was a part of history, gaming history, really, that hasn't been talked about a lot.
2830000	2839000	Like, you know, we talk about, you know, Roberta Williams, you know, River Raid was made by what we – this was one I honestly didn't know about.
2839000	2841000	So it's kind of like, oh, I want to go play this Wabbit game.
2841000	2843000	So I played a little bit of that.
2843000	2846000	And then, of course, I fell down the Atari 2600 rabbit hole.
2846000	2847000	Thank you.
2847000	2848000	Tigercloth found the article.
2848000	2854000	Van Tran was the name of the – but they had misspelled it like – they misspelled her first name, I think, or something.
2854000	2859000	But anyway, very cool story that was going around.
2859000	2861000	But then I fell down a rabbit hole.
2861000	2862000	I played one of my favorites.
2862000	2865000	H-E-R-O is one of my favorite 2600 games.
2865000	2866000	I was playing pitfalls.
2866000	2868000	I was playing a bunch of random stuff.
2868000	2870000	And then on NES, this is what I want to get to.
2870000	2875000	I played a Zelda randomizer because that's another thing I've been wanting to get into is I think the randomizers are fun.
2875000	2880000	But then I realized I'm really disgustingly out of practice on Zelda.
2880000	2891000	And so I need to just play Zelda 1, like, start to finish again before I think about doing a stupid randomizer because it's hard if you're getting killed the basic stuff.
2891000	2893000	So that's – I'm very out of practice.
2893000	2898000	But I think the randomizer stuff is something I really want to get into because I think it's really fascinating.
2898000	2903000	And I really love the randomizer that Zelda and Metroid mix together.
2903000	2905000	I think that's cool.
2905000	2906000	Oh, yeah, those are fun.
2906000	2908000	Yeah, the Z1M1 or whatever it's called.
2908000	2909000	I thought that was really cool.
2909000	2910000	So I want to get into that.
2910000	2917000	So thank you, emulators, for making that stuff possible because, I mean, Nintendo could do this themselves.
2917000	2922000	But I'm sure, you know, based on all these interviews Reggie's been doing about his book, I'm sure the line would be,
2922000	2928000	Nintendo doesn't see the value in doing – Nintendo doesn't see the value in randomizers.
2928000	2930000	Nintendo doesn't see the value in these classic IP.
2931000	2936000	Okay, then fine.
2936000	2939000	If you won't do it, then we will.
2939000	2942000	All right, let's move on.
2942000	2944000	We're going to get into some news and talk about other stuff that's been going on.
2944000	2946000	By the way, I should bring this up.
2946000	2951000	Usually we do a little bit of housekeeping after our gaming week and get into like what's in the news.
2951000	2953000	I should bring this up at some point.
2953000	2959000	We haven't done a lot of planning, but there's kind of a big show coming up for OLR, if you are not aware.
2960000	2965000	June 26th, 2022, which happens to be my birthday.
2965000	2968000	That's not the reason this is a big day, but it's a funny coincidence.
2968000	2977000	It is the closest show to June 23rd, which is the actual 20th birthday of Orange Lounge Radio.
2977000	2982000	So our 20th anniversary show will be June 26th, 2022.
2984000	2987000	I have no idea what we're going to do to make it special.
2990000	2993000	But that's it. I'm just putting it out there.
2993000	2996000	We will be doing our 20th anniversary show on June the 26th.
2996000	2998000	So we'll see.
2998000	2999000	Bobby says he will miss it.
2999000	3002000	You know what I kind of want to do?
3002000	3006000	I haven't talked to my co-host about this. I don't know.
3006000	3012000	But if Bobby's not here that night, that means we can do as long of a show as we want.
3012000	3017000	So if we want to do an all-day show, we can.
3017000	3019000	I kind of want to.
3020000	3022000	But I don't know. Then again, I also...
3022000	3024000	Be me screaming while I play Dead by Daylight in the background.
3024000	3028000	I'm also in my 40s and I'm like, I don't know if I could go out there anymore.
3028000	3030000	Rob, I've done 13 hours.
3030000	3033000	See, I don't know if I could. I don't know.
3033000	3036000	With the three of us, we could do a marathon. That would be easy.
3036000	3040000	Yeah, we probably could. It would be easy. We'll see.
3040000	3043000	So more planning to come. We've got six weeks to figure it out.
3043000	3047000	So in good OLR fashion, we'll figure it out in five weeks, the week before.
3047000	3052000	Alright, but I just wanted you to note, I wanted you to circle that on your calendar.
3052000	3055000	Just like Bobby Blackwolf neglected to do when he was like,
3055000	3057000	Oh, I'm going to go to Minneapolis instead.
3057000	3062000	But since it's for a charity event that's actually kind of awesome,
3062000	3065000	I guess I won't give him a lot of shit.
3065000	3072000	But it does mean that since Bobby won't be here, technically we could take over the stream for the entire day.
3072000	3075000	So there is a silver lining to this.
3075000	3078000	And I'm willing to work on the silver lining.
3078000	3081000	Other question here before we get into other news.
3081000	3084000	Tigerclaw says you played the new Evil Dead game.
3084000	3089000	I haven't. I watched some streams of it because a lot of the Dead by Daylight streamers are pivoting
3089000	3092000	because, you know, Evil Dead is another four versus one game.
3092000	3095000	But it looks very different. It doesn't really look...
3095000	3097000	And VHS is still down.
3097000	3098000	Yeah, VHS is still down.
3098000	3102000	The killer isn't like killers in Dead by Daylight.
3102000	3105000	And the whole crux of the game is different. And that's fine.
3105000	3109000	Not everything should be compared to Dead by Daylight just because it's four versus one.
3109000	3112000	Or evolve, if you will, just because it's four versus one.
3112000	3118000	It did look interesting. It looked like some of those enemies in it are mean.
3118000	3122000	Really, they rush at you and say, it looks kind of scary.
3122000	3124000	I don't know. It might be a bit too intense for me.
3124000	3126000	But I enjoyed watching the streams.
3126000	3127000	So, we'll see.
3127000	3129000	All right, let's get into gaming news.
3129000	3132000	We'll start off with this story from Loki.
3132000	3134000	Loki, please start us off.
3134000	3144000	Yes. So, there is a lawsuit against Valve saying that Steam is giving Valve too much power.
3144000	3148000	Apparently, it is moving forward in the US District Court.
3148000	3153000	And this is regarding, I guess, Wolfire Games.
3153000	3163000	They had alleged that Valve is using its, I guess, dominance of the market to enforce control over developers
3163000	3169000	and influencing how games, even non-Steam games, are sold and priced.
3169000	3177000	I think one of their arguments is there is a rule that you cannot price your game lower,
3177000	3182000	like on another marketplace permanently, than you can on Steam.
3182000	3187000	Because if you think about it, like if I put my game up on Steam,
3187000	3193000	but then I make it available on my site and selling it like, you know, much cheaper than it is on Steam,
3193000	3198000	I'm kind of using Steam as like, you know, trying to get exposure through Steam,
3198000	3200000	but then I'm selling it directly on my site.
3200000	3203000	Well, people would manipulate Steam's cut that way.
3203000	3210000	They would be, it's the whole Fortnite thing, which is a whole other Oprah I'm not going to get into,
3210000	3213000	but it's kind of that. But anyway, I digress.
3213000	3220000	Yeah. Also, any complaints about the percentage that they're taking that's, you know, 30% is too much,
3220000	3225000	even though I think a lot of the platforms out there right now take 30% as well.
3225000	3226000	Kind of standard, yeah.
3226000	3228000	It is kind of standard.
3228000	3232000	You know, according to Rosin, he said that,
3232000	3237000	I believe that this makes developers afraid that if they don't sell on Steam, they will lose the majority of their revenue.
3237000	3246000	To those developers, avoiding Steam would add unacceptable risk to the already high risk of game development in general.
3246000	3252000	I believe that most developers have little or no choice to sell on Steam and do as they're told by Valve.
3252000	3255000	Well, it's because they're the leading marketplace.
3255000	3259000	And if you want your game, you know, a lot of people use that marketplace.
3259000	3266000	It's just, I would be willing to bet Epic has probably similar rules when it comes to pricing your game.
3266000	3271000	And you're not limited to just sell on Steam. You can sell in other places.
3271000	3273000	Amazon has that same pricing rule, by the way.
3273000	3279000	Yeah. They're just saying that, like, you have to price your games the same. I don't know.
3279000	3285000	It's very similar. This is a throwback, but it's very similar to Walmart and audio CD censorship.
3285000	3290000	And how artists would get pissed off when their audio CDs would get censored,
3290000	3294000	like a sticker would go over something on the cover or there would be the clean lyrics version of the album,
3294000	3297000	because otherwise Walmart wouldn't sell it.
3297000	3305000	And to not be in Walmart would be to not have your CD sold in many parts of the country.
3305000	3310000	Obviously, the internet has fixed all of this, because now you can download anywhere.
3310000	3316000	But it reminds me of that, how things would be, literally art would be changed,
3316000	3322000	so it could be sold in a certain marketplace. And at least Steam isn't changing anything.
3323000	3328000	Loki, can I ask this question? You're a game maker. You're a game developer.
3328000	3330000	You're a published game developer.
3330000	3331000	Okay. Yeah.
3331000	3334000	Did you sell more of your game on itch.io or Steam?
3336000	3338000	I think it's about the same.
3338000	3339000	Okay.
3339000	3345000	Honestly, like, and itch still takes a cut too. I don't remember what their cut is, but I think it's similar.
3345000	3354000	I don't know, honestly, the numbers are so small, I can't tell you where more of them came from.
3354000	3358000	I think probably itch, but it's almost even, if anything.
3358000	3361000	Because I think you were telling people to get it on itch because you get a better cut.
3361000	3365000	No, I wasn't saying to do it that way necessarily.
3365000	3369000	It's basically the same either way. You get it.
3369000	3377000	Yeah, it's just easier than saying download this game, then download the DLC for this game as well.
3377000	3382000	I think that confused people a little bit, so I was just saying go through it because it's easier.
3382000	3385000	Or you can get it whatever platform you want, honestly.
3385000	3386000	Yeah.
3386000	3391000	But yeah, I don't know necessarily that.
3391000	3398000	The only pressure I think that I would feel if I was publishing a game, let's say it wasn't a Nintendo game,
3398000	3405000	the only pressure I'd feel of wanting to get my game on Steam is because that's where most of the eyeballs are.
3405000	3415000	And Steam is a huge marketplace where you could sell games and people just buy games off there like they're collecting stuff.
3415000	3418000	A lot of stuff you don't even play.
3418000	3423000	But you can probably make a lot of sales and they're doing that with bundles and stuff like that.
3423000	3425000	But it is a huge marketplace.
3425000	3430000	You could put your game on the Epic Game Store or something like that, but that's not as big of a marketplace.
3430000	3433000	Or good old games is another option as well.
3433000	3437000	But once again, those marketplaces aren't as large as Steam.
3437000	3439000	Steam is just massive.
3439000	3442000	There's lots of other storefronts.
3442000	3448000	And with being PC, it's super easy to just offer your game up through different storefronts.
3448000	3450000	I don't know, but we'll see.
3450000	3463000	Right now, the reason why, the lawsuit's moving forward because the judge agrees that there is sufficient to plausible alleged unlawful conduct, I guess.
3463000	3472000	So it's plausible that maybe they're doing something, but it's going to be a hard case to make, I think.
3472000	3474000	I think so, too.
3474000	3478000	I think because games can be sold in many other different marketplaces,
3478000	3481000	I think it's going to be a tough case to prove.
3481000	3491000	But we'll see because the justice branch of our government does all sorts of dumb things right now.
3491000	3493000	So who knows what's going to happen.
3493000	3495000	All right, moving on.
3495000	3499000	Let's talk about the Nintendo Indie World Showcase that happened this week.
3499000	3500000	Yay!
3500000	3501000	Indie World.
3501000	3506000	So it's a bunch of announcements, of course, about the more indie games that are available on Nintendo Switch.
3506000	3508000	They showed off 20 games.
3508000	3511000	Four games were available today.
3511000	3516000	Some of the games that they showed off at the Indie World included Ooblets,
3516000	3523000	Batora, Lost Haven, which is an actiony RPG type of game that's a little bit Diablo,
3523000	3526000	Elekhead, kind of a puzzle game.
3526000	3528000	Yeah, I saw that one.
3528000	3529000	Yeah.
3529000	3531000	Soundfall, which just came out.
3531000	3536000	And that game looked really cool because that was a music game dungeon crawler.
3536000	3540000	Talk about a game that's up my alley and it has over 140 songs in it.
3540000	3546000	I believe there is a Steam version of this, ironically enough, that I think you can import your own music, too,
3546000	3551000	which obviously you wouldn't be able to do on Nintendo Switch, but it does have 140 songs in it.
3551000	3552000	And that was really cool.
3552000	3553000	I want to check that game out.
3553000	3558000	So Soundfall was probably the one that got the most attention from me.
3558000	3561000	Wildfrost, a roguelike deck builder.
3561000	3565000	It's pretty cool with Norse mythology in it.
3565000	3569000	Totally accurate battle simulator.
3569000	3574000	Gunbrella, which is a new game from Gato Roboto developers, Doinksoft.
3574000	3578000	It's a noir punk Metroid kind of game.
3578000	3585000	We Are OFK, which is a kind of like making the band kind of narrative adventure.
3585000	3591000	And that has also just came out this week with the indie world.
3591000	3593000	Silt came out as well.
3593000	3597000	Looks like kind of a scary game with fish, scary fish.
3597000	3605000	Mini Motorways, Wayward Strand, Cult of the Lamb, which was a game that had been shown at PAX East.
3605000	3607000	So a lot of folks had their hand on it anyway.
3607000	3614000	Another Crab's Treasure, one-shot World Machine Edition, Gibbon Beyond the Trees.
3614000	3616000	Sorry, I'm running through this, but there's a lot of games.
3616000	3624000	Idol Manager, Card Shark, which is an interesting kind of looking card game where you actually are cheating at cards.
3624000	3625000	It's kind of cool.
3625000	3628000	Cursed to Golf.
3628000	3631000	That title alone is great.
3631000	3636000	It's a golf roguelike game that was also at PAX East, so some people saw that already.
3636000	3643000	A guidebook of Babel and Opus Echo of Starsong, the full bloom edition.
3643000	3655000	So I don't think there were any games in there that people, like huge indie games, but there was some PAX stuff and some things that were ports of PC things that people were excited to see about.
3655000	3667000	But this is definitely the calm before, I would assume, the big June Nintendo Direct that will have what we can expect for the rest of the year.
3667000	3669000	So that would be pretty cool.
3669000	3671000	So that was Indie World.
3671000	3673000	Let's move on, Dark Sakura.
3677000	3679000	Finding my unmute button would be nice. Hello.
3679000	3680000	Hi.
3680000	3685000	So Twitter is doing video games, kind of, sort of.
3686000	3695000	Basically, there is a little game that they put out called Twitter Data Dash.
3695000	3706000	And it's a little side-scrolling platformer that basically tries to prepare one for how to combat disinformation on the internet.
3707000	3712000	You play a little cute puppy. He's blue. His name is Data.
3712000	3719000	And you have to find these bones that are hidden in this environment.
3722000	3735000	Basically, after you complete the objective, the level ends and then Twitter gives you information, like a PSA announcement before you can go on.
3735000	3753000	The author here says that they gave instructions on how to filter DMs or how to turn off targeted ads, stuff like that.
3753000	3761000	But then, as you go through the game, though, you do have some sort of enemy.
3762000	3770000	So, like, when you start the game, it gives you a warning of avoiding cat ads that are in the way.
3770000	3775000	And you run into some cats who have their own little propaganda.
3775000	3778000	And you have to dodge them to not take damage.
3778000	3781000	But I want to hug the cats.
3781000	3783000	Me too. I want to hug every cat.
3784000	3794000	The thing is that it's been stated by other people that if Twitter wanted it to be accurate, you wouldn't be just running around freely.
3794000	3800000	You wouldn't just be dodging bad guys and getting bones or whatever.
3800000	3804000	The bad guys would be unavoidable.
3804000	3809000	They would crush you. They would surround you.
3810000	3813000	And they would even do it when you're not playing.
3813000	3818000	Because that's how the internet works.
3818000	3825000	If we were going to have a more accurate representation, we'd be playing fucking Twitter meets Elden Ring.
3825000	3833000	But I can see what is behind it.
3833000	3836000	I can see it being a conversation starter.
3836000	3838000	Something to get people thinking about it.
3840000	3848000	And also, how can Musk not realize that there are fucking fake accounts on Twitter?
3848000	3850000	I mean, seriously?
3850000	3855000	He's doing his research. He's checking 100 random accounts to make sure they're not bots.
3855000	3859000	He's going to find some roleplay accounts and be like, the fuck is this shit?
3859000	3862000	I hope he comes across everybody's alts.
3862000	3865000	I hope he finds one of my roleplay accounts that I don't touch anymore.
3865000	3869000	That sample size, 100 out of 3.5 million or something like that?
3869000	3872000	That's not even scratching the surface.
3872000	3874000	Apparently he claims that's what Twitter does internally.
3874000	3877000	But you know what? This story has nothing to do with him.
3877000	3881000	And as far as I'm concerned, I would like Twitter to have nothing to do with him.
3881000	3883000	And I'm hoping to hell that deal falls apart.
3883000	3886000	Because I've said this very openly on my Twitter.
3886000	3890000	If he reverses that ban on the insurrectionist, I'm out.
3890000	3893000	I'm out. I'm not using Twitter anymore. Period.
3894000	3897000	And people are quick to say, oh, you're just being dramatic.
3897000	3899000	You don't mean it. No, I fucking mean it.
3899000	3901000	Spite is incredibly motivating.
3901000	3906000	There is nothing forcing me to use Twitter.
3906000	3909000	I like Twitter. I've met a lot of awesome people on Twitter.
3909000	3912000	But I'm not going to use it if he's back on it. Bye.
3916000	3918000	I still would rather Twitter than Facebook.
3918000	3920000	Even with.
3921000	3923000	Facebook is even more harmful.
3923000	3925000	I don't know where I go.
3925000	3928000	And I'm not just going to say, oh, I'm going to do Instagram.
3928000	3930000	Going back to LiveJournal, baby.
3930000	3932000	I've been tempted, actually.
3932000	3935000	Actually, you know what I will say I like?
3935000	3937000	Is Pillowfort.
3937000	3939000	Because it's very similar to LiveJournal.
3939000	3943000	Without basically being a Russian company at this point.
3943000	3945000	I still have my lifetime account.
3945000	3948000	Yeah, I know. Yeah, that's true. I have mine too.
3948000	3950000	But Pillowfort's nice.
3950000	3957000	But I think if Twitter does unban You-Know-Who,
3957000	3959000	I think there's going to be.
3959000	3964000	And I know people are quick to point out he has said he's not coming back to Twitter.
3964000	3968000	Number one, I don't trust a word out of that motherfucker's mouth.
3968000	3973000	And I call him the same thing that Patti LuPone calls a motherfucker.
3973000	3975000	And number two.
3975000	3977000	Except I don't think his mom would do it.
3977000	3979000	Number two.
3979000	3981000	Sometimes it's about the principal.
3981000	3989000	Rolling out the red carpet and inviting the person back is bad enough for me that I'm willing to leave.
3989000	3991000	So, anyway.
3991000	3993000	Just pulling that out there.
3993000	3997000	That still, though, doesn't really have.
3997000	3999000	Oh, yeah, it has nothing to do with the game.
3999000	4000000	Yeah, sorry.
4000000	4004000	So, the game, obviously, this was something that was being worked on before any of that.
4005000	4006000	Go ahead.
4006000	4007000	I had a little bit more about it.
4007000	4008000	Yeah, go for it.
4008000	4013000	The thing is that I think that the game itself, like I was saying, is a great idea.
4013000	4020000	It's good to get it into the thoughts of people who would not normally think about this kind of thing.
4020000	4025000	Actually, probably even good for kids new to social media.
4025000	4029000	You know, get them starting to be on the road to good habits.
4029000	4035000	But as many have pointed out, it's not going to do enough.
4035000	4041000	But if it can get the conversation started and get people thinking about what they read,
4041000	4053000	then even if that thing returns, if it can at least get people starting to think objectively about anything anyone says on the internet,
4053000	4055000	then I'm for it.
4055000	4057000	It's a little gesture.
4057000	4060000	We know it's not the whole story.
4060000	4062000	Who fucking cares?
4062000	4064000	It's getting the conversation started.
4064000	4070000	I applaud the attempt to educate, and I think games go a long way in educating,
4070000	4075000	and we don't often talk about that topic on this show, although we all reminisce about the Oregon Trail,
4075000	4078000	Carmen Sandiego, Number Munchers, and all those edutainment games,
4078000	4080000	Reader Rabbit, whatever.
4080000	4083000	We all reminisce about the edutainment games of the past.
4083000	4086000	But games are a very effective tool in being able to teach.
4086000	4091000	I think as far as this one goes, the only kind of weird thing about it for me,
4091000	4096000	I only heard about it through video game blogs and the types of sites.
4096000	4099000	I didn't see anything about it on Twitter.
4099000	4105000	And Twitter knows that I play video games because I get the recommended topics and all that.
4105000	4107000	So Twitter knows I'm like a gamer.
4107000	4111000	So it's weird to me that Twitter themselves hasn't tried to put this game in front of me.
4111000	4113000	And I don't know if maybe it's just a slow burn.
4113000	4115000	They're not ready to do that yet.
4115000	4118000	They want to test it a little more and that sort of thing.
4118000	4122000	But it's a little weird that I only found out about it because I follow gaming things.
4122000	4124000	Or maybe that was the intent. I don't know.
4124000	4129000	But I feel like this needs to get out in front of a lot of people, not just...
4129000	4131000	I like the art style, though.
4131000	4134000	Yeah. There's a lot of good things about it.
4134000	4136000	And I applaud the fact that they're trying,
4136000	4140000	despite the fact that we might be pointing out ways it could be better.
4140000	4143000	But how dare they demonize cats like that? I'm serious.
4143000	4146000	That's the number one complaint I have, that's for sure.
4146000	4150000	All right. Well, let's talk about something that a lot of people are bitching about.
4150000	4155000	Not people I follow, but I'm seeing a lot of bitching elsewhere on Twitter about this one.
4155000	4157000	Loki, please.
4157000	4167000	What? We talked about last week how Square Enix made the brilliant decision to sell off their assets
4167000	4171000	because they're jumping headfirst into the NFT market.
4171000	4176000	And just like, you know, the south part, I mean, and it's gone.
4176000	4183000	So the end of team market is basically down 92% from last September.
4183000	4190000	So it's crashing hard. There's been the hashtag crypto crash going around.
4190000	4195000	They said $200 billion has been recently wiped out of it.
4195000	4203000	And even on top of that, you know, cryptocurrency is also down as a whole right now and by a lot, I think.
4203000	4209000	So it's, you know, not a probably a good time to jump in the NFTs.
4209000	4212000	Or maybe this is the dip that we all have to buy.
4212000	4215000	That's probably what they're trying to convince us.
4215000	4220000	That's what those Twitter accounts will be convincing you of right now, attempting to convince you of.
4221000	4229000	So there was another game company that had put out was Axie Infinity, which was a kind of a Pokemon type game,
4229000	4239000	I guess that you would breed monsters with potions and you would use your cryptocurrency, your earned cryptocurrency through that.
4239000	4249000	But apparently, though, the Axie Infinity's SLP or their Smooth Love Potions, which is, I guess, the currency that they had.
4250000	4256000	Went down to zero from I'm not sure where I was originally at here.
4256000	4260000	Let's see. A lot more than zero, I believe.
4260000	4264000	But yeah, it's pretty much worthless now.
4264000	4270000	So it's one of those play the earned game so you can earn a bunch of worthless stuff like any other game.
4270000	4276000	There's a lot of video games that you earn worthless stuff, but, you know, basically people lied to thinking it would.
4276000	4284000	Yeah, it wasn't worth a ton. I mean, this is kind of like Dogecoin a little bit where like SLP was basically at thirty five cents each.
4284000	4288000	But now it's, you know, a lot less than that.
4288000	4294000	So that's quite a drop. But. You know. Not great.
4294000	4300000	I already ranted about this plenty last week, so I'm not going to repeat myself, but I'm just going to stress, you know, again.
4300000	4309000	And I think, you know, if you listen carefully to what the three of us were talking about last week in that discussion on NFT, we said in there there is potential.
4309000	4313000	There is potential with this, with the right implementation of it.
4314000	4319000	The problem is the face of NFT right now is crime.
4319000	4334000	Get rich quick schemes, hacks, Twitter, MLMs, basically Reddit posts like the face and those hideous fucking monkeys.
4334000	4340000	The face of NFT right now is so broken, like no fucking shit. It crashed.
4340000	4349000	And if this technology is ever to be rescued and implemented for something good, it needs a better face.
4349000	4355000	It needs something better behind it. It doesn't need a Pokemon knockoff. It needs Pokemon.
4355000	4359000	It doesn't need a knockoff of a good racing game.
4359000	4371000	It needs a good racing game with a good reason and something that doesn't fucking read as transparent because the gaming community will be up your ass if you implement something that's half assed.
4371000	4378000	Again, I'm going to point to the Diablo three real money auction house, which as far as I'm concerned was this many years ago and has already failed.
4378000	4387000	So if this is ever to be successful, and again, I'm not going to repeat myself a lot from last week, but it just needs to have a better mascot than what it has right now.
4387000	4396000	It needs to stop feeling like a giant fucking pyramid scheme because that's what it feels like. And I'm sure there's lots of crypto bros that want to take issue with what I said. Tough shit.
4396000	4406000	I'm just saying what everyone is thinking. I just told you what the problem is. Maybe you should instead of trying to bully people into your opinion and how we're all wrong about NFTs.
4406000	4412000	Maybe you should work on fixing the actual problem. Done.
4412000	4416000	Would anyone else like to add anything?
4416000	4421000	All right. No, I think that pretty much sums it up. I think I try my best. All right, then let's- Well done.
4421000	4428000	Yes, DarkSagra? I said well done, Rob. Well done. Oh, okay. I thought you said hold on. And I was like, Oh, yes, please. No. All right.
4428000	4436000	All right. Let's move on and talk about Final Fantasy 14. This controversy seems so like light hearted compared to the last one.
4436000	4444000	But anyway, Final Fantasy 14 is having some issues with mods because mods really aren't allowed for Final Fantasy 14.
4444000	4456000	You are not supposed to be using third party modifications that will change your HUD so that you can do things that aren't normally in the game. Very controversial with things like DPS meters.
4457000	4467000	Also, like these add ons and HUD upgrades, they're all over WoW, World of Warcraft, and have generally been accepted as a part of WoW for a long time.
4467000	4474000	They're not in Final Fantasy or they're not really endorsed by Final Fantasy 14. And in fact, they're actually against the terms of service.
4474000	4483000	It's interesting, though, because there was one point when Final Fantasy 14 was supposed to be embracing these. They said they were going to kind of support mods and allow it.
4483000	4496000	But then I think they had a change of heart when they saw how people tend to treat DPS meters, and that people would just be shits to people over their DPS if they weren't, you know, the best of the best.
4496000	4503000	And some of the toxic stuff you see in WoW, which is interesting that WoW is now implementing a social contract, but I digress a little bit.
4503000	4519000	Anyway, what's going on? And why is this issue coming up now? Because there's a world first race going on right now. And there's a new raid that was in the game, Dragon Songs reprise. It is very hard. It is considered an ultimate raid.
4519000	4532000	Final Fantasy 14 does not do test servers. People were not able to explore this fight before the fact, like happens a lot in WoW. When this went live, this was people's first time kind of getting to see all this.
4532000	4544000	So this is the first time that this was out. And there's a big world first race amongst all these different, you know, raiding groups that try to put this together.
4544000	4562000	And there was a stream of the game, a Final Fantasy 14 player, Hiroro, was playing the game, and he had mods visible on his stream as was racing for world first. He got automatically teleported to the Mordian Jail.
4562000	4573000	It is a room. And by the way, if you listen to other podcasts, call this Gaol. It's just jail. It's an old English way of saying jail. And they use this a lot in Final Fantasy 14.
4573000	4594000	So the player went to the Mordian Jail, and that was all happening live on stream. And the GM basically said, you have to change it or you're going to get a suspension. The footage has since been erased from Twitch, but you know how it goes.
4594000	4608000	There are screenshots of the stream. There's something on YouTube going on. Oh yeah, Bagel Goose happened to them too. They also got transported to the jail, and that is all on YouTube to see.
4608000	4626000	So yeah, it actually cultivated with Yoshi P writing a whole letter basically saying, stop using these add ons. You're not supposed to be using them. But maybe it's sort of like a peace offering or something like that.
4626000	4635000	They're looking at possibly upping the HUD elements that are in the game right now. In the statement, Yoshida said,
4657000	4659000	Meaning they've beaten it in house.
4660000	4674000	Square Enix may stop congratulating race winning teams if this public recognition encourages excessive competition and controversy so that third party tools are used. That's very interesting, I think.
4674000	4690000	But, you know, it's interesting because, you know, they kind of go on to say, maybe they need to make some improvements to the HUD and work on that. So the team is kind of looking at this going, all right, what can we do to make this better, rather than just, you know, yell at everybody for breaking the rule.
4690000	4693000	So I think that's kind of interesting.
4720000	4731000	So by default, everybody's pretty much playing on PC, but Final Fantasy 14, I think really embraces its nature of being playable both on PC and PlayStation. So, yeah.
4732000	4741000	All right. Anyhow, we're going to move on to our next story. So Dark Sakura, why don't you take up our next story?
4742000	4756000	All right. So when we had the Black Lives Matter protests, the video game companies were pretty loud and vocal in support of it, remember?
4757000	4760000	Yes, all the white text on black backgrounds. Yes, I do remember that.
4760000	4783000	Yep. For the record, this is important. At any rate, when there was that leaked draft of that disgusting opinion by Justice Alito, our video game companies have actually been pretty silent about it.
4784000	4800000	I mean, then again, how many of them are mostly white dudes, cis dudes who wouldn't know anything about a woman's body except insert tab A into slot B, repeat as necessary.
4800000	4816000	But anyway, we did get some support. And actually, don't just get me started on that one because that man has zero concept of who he's referencing in history.
4816000	4829000	The people that he's referencing are back from the 1800s, the 1700s, and back in those days, guys had no involvement other than getting their wives pregnant and they were slave owners.
4830000	4841000	All right, I'm going to take a step back because I could go off on this as someone who knows history. That man needs to get his Catholic ass back in school with a real history teacher.
4842000	4865000	Anyway, so after the draft was leaked on May 2nd, Bungie published a statement in regards to reproductive rights saying that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, it is, quote, a blow to freedom in America and a direct attack on human rights.
4866000	4881000	And had asked fans to donate to reproductive rights organizations. A few other indie developers like Double Fine, ArenaNet that does Guild Wars, did their own statements.
4881000	4899000	And then there's some workers who said that they would participate in the week long Mother's Day strike by stopping work for their companies for that week. But the biggest names haven't said anything.
4899000	4919000	I mean, we had almost universal support for Black Lives Matter. But I mean, and actually, and also for the anti Asian hate crimes that were happening right after COVID-19 was, you know, a new pandemic.
4919000	4930000	But, and I'm going to go ahead and say what my sources on this Washington Post, and they reached out to 20 different video game companies, and only Microsoft and Activision replied.
4930000	4950000	Microsoft said, Microsoft will continue to do everything we can under the law to protect our employees rights and support employees and their enrolled dependents and accessing critical health care, which already includes services like abortion and gender affirming care regardless of where they live across the US.
4951000	4962000	The support is being extended to include travel expense assistance for these and other medical services where access to care is limited and availability in the employees home geographic region.
4962000	4973000	Amazon, Tesla, Lyft, Uber promised monetary aid and legal protection to their employees in states that have bans.
4973000	4989000	But the thing is, there's all these other states that are already have legislation in the wings or have passed legislation that is now on a stay.
4989000	5007000	That all of that is threatened to be overturned and I think in Missouri, they said that if you leave this state to seek health care of that nature, and it is health care, it is health care that they will prosecute.
5008000	5026000	And now, the studio Certain Affinity, which worked on Halo Infinite based in Texas, their CEO was saying that it took them by surprise and he's quoted saying that we will absolutely take a strong stance on this.
5026000	5038000	We will consider how to best support our staff who may be effective, but we haven't had a chance to get out in front of messaging or strategy yet. It caught us a bit off guard. We're still an independent company with limited resources.
5038000	5052000	The thing is, is that this is absolutely an attack on women and uterus possessing people. It is an attack.
5052000	5075000	Alito's document stated that by his weird convoluted logic, that this is not a gender issue, that it is not discriminatory against women or those possessing a uterus. It absolutely is, because the only people that it affects are people who can be pregnant.
5075000	5095000	And the theory is that with reversing this, that they're going to start pushing for more and more like reversing access to contraception, to start reversing things like marriage equality,
5095000	5106000	supporting our transgender people, the protections that they have. It's a major step in reverse.
5125000	5142000	Didn't Disney just get shat upon for not saying enough where they were? Everything is going to be a damned if you do, damned if you don't take your fucking stance and own it and defend it.
5142000	5165000	Because you know what talks, at least in the US? Money. And you know what one of the biggest industries in this country is right now? Gaming. Technology. You don't have support from those industries. You're going to get fucked.
5165000	5185000	And on top of that, especially, I'm actually surprised that Activision Blizzard would make a comment against the overturning given their history. But it's a wise move, even if it is purely for the optics.
5185000	5199000	Did you see the thing, though, and I don't mean to digress too much, but it's not on our show tonight. And I have to ask, did you see the thing, though, that they published trying to get some weird internet points or something about the diversity math is what it basically boils down to.
5199000	5214000	I didn't see that. Oh, look up the tweets. Oh, wait, I have a statement here, though. It says we are committed to an inclusive environment that is supportive of all of our employees. This comes from Rich George, who's their spokesperson.
5214000	5223000	As a company, providing fair and equitable health care is a top priority, and we will closely monitor developments in the coming weeks and months. And then Mikey Barra.
5224000	5237000	He said, I realize that we are late, and I am sorry it has been incredibly stressful for Blizzard and me personally as we read the news. I realize this isn't very helpful, but I'm being honest where we are and what we are discussing across the company.
5237000	5249000	And then they go into some of that about employees being distracted, scared for the future, about Kotick's commitment to improving the working conditions.
5250000	5261000	And then I love this part of it. In fact, I'm actually going to read this verbatim. Mr. Kotick made a commitment to improve the working conditions of the many lives that work under him and make Activision the best company it can be.
5261000	5268000	And I can say without hesitation that as of right now, he's failing all of us. Thank you.
5268000	5279000	No, I didn't read that. Usually anytime I see something from Activision, it makes me want to vomit. So I'll go look for it.
5279000	5289000	It's pretty cringe. It's just one of those things where it's like, what did you hope you were going to get from talking about this? I don't know. It is weird. It's very weird.
5289000	5290000	Well, one last-
5290000	5293000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, go ahead.
5293000	5305000	One last quote on this one comes from Robert Anderberg, who's the CEO of Control Z. It says, our position on abortion rights in the U.S. is that we support a woman's right to choose to have an abortion for any reason.
5305000	5314000	It says the company operates in five countries, including the U.S. However, of these countries, the U.S. is the only one where abortion is restricted and about to become more so.
5314000	5328000	We are socially behind. We are way socially behind. And that's what you fucking get when you form a country based on religious escapism. Because I'm sorry.
5328000	5332000	Even though we're supposed to have separation of church and state in this country, but that's the amendment everyone's-
5332000	5344000	But the country, the first people fucking over here, apart from the people who were after money, were basically religious extremists. That's just how it goes.
5344000	5367000	At any rate, the Mother's Day strike, actually, it ends today being Sunday. But I still ask everybody out there that if you are a woman, if you know a woman or a uterus-possessing individual who is capable of giving birth,
5367000	5393000	think about how you are hurting them if you support the overturning. Think about the mental health of these people and ask yourself if especially- because I can tell you this way, the rich people of the world are always going to have access to contraception and abortive care.
5393000	5409000	They're always going to have access. This affects the poor, the disenfranchised, many minorities in the country. And it's another way that they're trying to contain power amongst the wealthy.
5409000	5432000	And instead, ask yourself this. If you support- if you want to ban abortion everywhere, then are you willing to convert our government to a socialist model that will then pay for all of these births that you're sponsoring, basically, with your words?
5433000	5443000	Are you ready for us to be a socialist country? Because that's the only way that we're going to take care of all of these people, or else you're going to end up with a lot of dead children on your hands. And it's all your fault.
5443000	5457000	Secondly, the heartbeat bill? There's no fucking science that there's a heartbeat that early. It's electric synapses. The heart has not fucking formed. Science, people. Read a fucking science book. Okay, I'm done.
5457000	5462000	No, you're fine. You're fine. I'm not going to talk over you when you're talking on this segment.
5462000	5481000	Part of that, and I'm going to be perfectly upfront with everybody, I had my tubes removed. And one person tried to talk me out of it. A medical professional and women and uterus-possessing people younger than me who have gone in for sterilization have been rejected.
5481000	5496000	And I will tell all of you this right now. If you are going to the doctor to be sterilized, no matter your age, if you are of an age of consent, if they do not do it, you ask them, I want it in writing that you are refusing to treat me.
5496000	5499000	Okay.
5499000	5516000	No, you're fine. Let me get to some chat. You're getting a lot of snaps. Go exactly. Preach it. You get a lot of that from chat. But I do want to read some of these other comments. Questbuster says, Bungie's Twitter also clapped back at responses telling them that they should only be a game company and keep politics out of it.
5516000	5534000	Yeah, honestly, I thought that was pretty great too. I have a little bit of sympathy. I understand the companies that are like, we were caught off guard with this and we don't have a statement yet. We were all caught off guard by this, but this should be a huge fucking wake up call.
5534000	5546000	And I think it is for a lot of people like a lot of people didn't want to admit Oh, when they stole those Supreme Court seats, and they stole those Supreme Court seats again, I'm I know this isn't a political podcast, and you all probably don't want to hear it. But
5546000	5559000	like this politics do exactly look at the impact it's having on games reality check. Look at the impact it's having on the game developers reality check. It's it's it is games, whether you want it to be or not.
5559000	5583000	And those and those Supreme Court seats were stolen. Let's let's be completely honest, they were stolen. For this purpose, I have to take another semi sidestep and address something that pod culture said about Christina, having to fight to get her hysterectomy for endo endometriosis is actually under diagnosed in in uterus possessing people.
5584000	5595000	But they want to women are often don't get and I'm using women now in the I'm possessing a uterus thing even though I know it's not entirely accurate. It's just easy to say.
5596000	5614000	Endometriosis is debilitating illness, it causes pain, it can lead to infertility, and it goes so under diagnosed that by the time it can take anywhere between five to 10 years for a person to get a diagnosis of this.
5614000	5625000	And people will go in like around 1516 with debilitating pain, not get any diagnosis until they're in their late 20s. And by then, it's too late.
5627000	5640000	Women, people with coronary issues are often under diagnosed, because it doesn't present itself the same way it does in in male bodies.
5641000	5652000	Overall, there is such a poor understanding of the way that a feminine body works.
5653000	5668000	Because all of the medical research has been done mostly on male bodies. Because, especially in Western culture, the female population has been seen with disdain, especially in the US.
5668000	5679000	That's just always been how it is when the, you know, Alito keeps going back to the Constitution. But the thing is that the Constitution was written by by rich white men, slave owners.
5679000	5694000	Women were not considered at all in the drafting of the Constitution. People of color were not appreciated at all in the drafting of the Constitution. It took amendments to have that consideration.
5694000	5709000	So if you apply all of this historical context to what we are dealing with right now, it makes perfect sense. And it also makes sense that everything that they're trying to do is going to rewind us back as a society.
5709000	5722000	This isn't just political. This has to do with physical health, mental health, quality of life. And it's absolutely disgusting.
5722000	5750000	And the moment that you take a step back, and you look at a uterus possessing person as a fully realized human being who should have the same rights and control of their body as any penis possessing person, and I said penis on the show and I feel glad about it.
5752000	5763000	I had to lighten things up a little bit. I want to say it too. But okay, penis, fine. But anyway, Loki, you want to join in? Vagina, how about that? Okay.
5763000	5789000	But the penile possessing are given more rights, especially if you are white and cisgender, and have money and are Christian. If you hit all those little tick marks, you're at the top of the food chain. You get. You have all the rights. No one can fuck with you, basically.
5790000	5816000	But if you were anything less than that, you are other. If you were anything that is not, you know, business suited, you know, fine dining white people, you are still considered even I can tell you this right now, if you hit all of those tick marks, but you're black, you're already other.
5816000	5843000	If you hit all of those tick marks, but you're a woman, you're already other. It's this disgusting double standard that's in this country and then we have people who are really at the bottom of the food chain who just think automatically because they are white that they are exempt from all of this that they don't care because it's not happening to them. Well, guess fucking what? It does happen to you.
5843000	5866000	You are in that lower percentile and you are other to them. They don't give a shit. And if you want them to give a shit, you need to start thinking objectively. You need to start using logic. You need to take your emotions out of the picture and lay down the fact, study your history, look at the world around you, look at other fucking countries.
5866000	5895000	Our internet searches here are so America based once they check your IP that it's hard to find actual news that is happening outside of this country. Like I have to use a VPN if I actually want to go to the real BBC website, for example. And we need to stop looking at our little narrow box. We need to stop looking at the thing that's right in front of us and look at the big picture. It is not just you in this country. It is not just me in this country.
5895000	5918000	And it's not just this country. We're a fucking world. What we do here affects so many other people on top of it. People look to America. I hate to say it because what the fuck are we doing right now? But people look to us. And the moment that we keep othering our own people is just going to widen those divisive lines.
5918000	5929000	It's going to weaken us as a country. It's going to weaken our individual people, weakens our economies. And I know that I'm going way past the video game thing here right now, but-
5929000	5932000	Ain't no one going to stop you. Go off.
5932000	5947000	But all of this together, it's all intertwined. I mean, and then let's go back to that othering. Let's look in the video game industry for othering. How are women treated in multiplayer games once someone finds out that it's a woman?
5947000	5970000	Even though we now make up the majority of gamers online. We are the majority now. And I'll go with SSJ100Matt here. The people who claim extremism or supremacy doesn't exist are really quiet after yesterday's tragedy. We've had two back to back now. There was another one.
5971000	5984000	And yeah, I agree. Take your thoughts and prayers and shove it. Although I do like sending people the gift of this big dark satanic looking altar thing and saying thoughts and prayers. I love that one.
5985000	6013000	Oh, Ron was correct. Three. Three, yeah. And then the thing is, is that people need, this is the other thing too. People need to look past their own selfishness. America is built on pure fucking selfishness. Me first. What does this do for me? Pull myself up, pull yourself up by your bootstraps. I'm not helping.
6013000	6042000	But the moment that we start helping each other, the moment that we start thinking outside of our own narrow point of view, our own narrow blinders, like they put on horses, blinders. When you take off the blinders and you see that there are other people around you, when we start putting it together, it's not that hard of a burden when more people are shouldering it.
6043000	6067000	When we start, when the rich white men of the world start looking out to the women and treating them with respect, look out to people who are of a different color than they are. Because I'll be perfectly honest now, this concept of race amongst people, I understand genetically that there, there, there indeed are some differences.
6067000	6074000	You know, some people are more resistant to being sunburned. Some people are more resistant to other, but we are all human. Huh?
6074000	6076000	As you said, not me.
6076000	6077000	Me either.
6077000	6080000	I step out of the sun for two seconds. It's like, I got to burn.
6080000	6081000	But it was my example.
6081000	6082000	I don't mean to interrupt, but.
6083000	6087000	What they're doing is separating us by, by the visual results of our genes.
6087000	6088000	Yeah.
6088000	6099000	They're separating us by the parts of our body. They're separating us by whether we are neuro-typical or neuro-atypical like, like myself.
6100000	6124000	It's going to stop when we can break those barriers, when we can respect those things that have formed these people, when we respect that, yes, you had a different upbringing than me because of these economic social factors that are affecting your life because of how the government's trying to police you because of demonization in media.
6124000	6136000	But I'm not going to look at those things. I am going to see you as a person. I want to know your story and I want to respect that. I believe in equity.
6136000	6147000	Equality, you know, that, that, that thing where the people looking over the fence, right? You have the tall person who can see over the fence and then you put the, the, uh, the stool up.
6147000	6154000	The thing is that you need to lower the fence so that everyone's going to be able to look over that fence the same way.
6154000	6156000	Yeah. Why is there a fence? Yeah.
6156000	6167000	Well, that's a different story, but I'm getting, I'm getting way off, but I am passionate about this, but I also feel very logical about it.
6167000	6184000	For me, this should not be a question of emotion. This should not be a question of what your magic book says. And I say this as a practicing Jewish woman for, and by the way, I pissed off my mother because, and I asked about it.
6184000	6199000	If carrying a pregnancy is going to negatively impact your quality of life, you will save your life by having the abortion. Ask your rabbi though. Your rabbi may say something different. Mine said that.
6199000	6213000	But I'm going to leave that there. Just respect people. The moment that you stop seeing women and start seeing human.
6213000	6231000	Just respect people. It's all it takes. Understand that the things that we go through, they're different than what you go through. We do have different needs and, uh, access to abortion.
6231000	6246000	If you cut that access, all it's going to mean is that there will be unsafe abortions. People will die all because of you and your magic book.
6246000	6258000	I want to get to an earlier comment, um, because I think it it's, it's a very apt comment and it also has to do with a lot of this. Um, you know how the gaming industry is responding and this sort of thing. And I think this is worth reading.
6258000	6270000	Uh, it's from SSG, one hundred Matt earlier in the chat who says some companies are hesitant to be a part of the story after what happened to Disney, which I get. The thing is that we need folks in power to speak out when detrimental legislation comes through
6270000	6281000	because it's not going to stop. We can March and protest all we want, but the people in power move the needle while I understand companies for not speaking out, but the folks and companies that do, they have my respect.
6281000	6293000	Yeah. And I think that's why so many of us are frustrated that the Senate technically has a majority, but I also asked, do they? Cause I don't think they do. I think we keep sitting here going, Democrats have the Senate and the house and the presidency.
6293000	6303000	They don't have the Senate on paper. They have, they don't have the Senate. We all know that, but that's, that's a whole other issue that is getting political. That's a whole other thing, but I do want to, I do want to say one thing.
6304000	6307000	Can I quickly finish my thought and that'll go back to you.
6307000	6309000	I'm sorry.
6309000	6329000	That we need the Senate to do, we need the government to do something. We need the, and at least I saw the passion in Elizabeth Warren for sure. And I'm starting to see it in some of the other people as well. It just, we need to take that into actual action and not just talk. Okay. I'm sorry, dark soccer, but I just want to finish that.
6329000	6343000	You know, one of, one of the podcasts that I listen to regularly is Stuff Mom Never Told You. I adore Annie and Samantha. They're, they're lovely people, but they had a conversation with Melita Easters.
6343000	6349000	And it's a very good conversation and they do break down a lot of those arguments in Alita's paperwork.
6349000	6367000	And if you really want to know, want to hear more of a in-depth discussion about it, I highly recommend that episode. It was last Wednesday's episode. And well, I mean, the podcast is amazing anyway, but I would definitely listen to that episode.
6367000	6374000	There is a lot of good to be gathered from that one if you want to educate yourself very well.
6374000	6377000	I'll just look up the name of the episode.
6377000	6388000	Let's move on with the video games and we're going to cleanse the palette a little bit, but yeah, great, great talk, but we're going to, um, while dark soccer cleanses the palette with a churro.
6388000	6394000	See there, uh, I'm jealous by the way. That's one of the things I miss after diabetes is churros.
6394000	6395000	I made Dan go to Del Taco for me.
6395000	6404000	I haven't had a churro and I don't know how long, but anyway, one of these days, one of these days, I'm almost, I'm almost, I can't believe this. I'm almost to 50 pounds lost.
6404000	6411000	And when I get there, I'm three pounds away. When I get there, I might just have to go to a theme park and have a churro just one time, just one time.
6411000	6418000	Anyway. All right. Uh, let's cleanse the palette a little bit by talking about a real train wreck of a video game.
6418000	6420000	And, uh, we'll go to the next story from Loki.
6421000	6434000	Yes. So, uh, there was a wonderful video game leak on 4chan. Um, that was the original 2001 build of Duke Nukem Forever.
6434000	6442000	So this was the one that they showed the E3 videos for. Um, and I may have been actually at E3 at one time.
6443000	6453000	Um, it looks pretty good. I mean, honestly, um, but it was confirmed by George Broussard that it does appear to be the actual thing.
6453000	6461000	Although he made a point to like, you really need to temper your expectations because there's not really any game to play.
6461000	6468000	It's just some barely populated test levels and what they kind of showed off during E3.
6468000	6474000	But honestly, what they showed off, like even with this 2001 demo thing looks pretty good.
6474000	6482000	I'm hoping that someone can take this and like, you know, flesh it out to a full fledged 2001 Duke Nukem Forever game or something.
6482000	6492000	But yeah. And if you want to check it out, you can actually play it because it has been uploaded to the internet archive.
6492000	6502000	But don't expect much of a game. Like it's, it's, but I think, I think it's an interesting story in what you see at E3 versus reality.
6502000	6506000	I think it's a very interesting sort of story with that.
6506000	6513000	Yeah. Apogee's founder Scott Miller said, looks like someone leaked a build of our Duke Nukem Forever from 2001.
6513000	6522000	Anyone expecting much of a playable game will be disappointed. The game's brilliant trailer from that period definitely overrepresented what the game actually played like.
6522000	6524000	It's a very honest comment.
6524000	6528000	Yeah. But yeah.
6528000	6535000	You know, I don't know. This one of those things where it's like, you know, it's a little weird that something unpublished got leaked, but at the same time, you know, it's so old at this point.
6535000	6540000	And I think there's just, there's obviously some fascinating stories there behind the development of this game. It's interesting.
6540000	6549000	Bobby Blackwell says, was any of the content from this demo in the gearbox Duke Nukem Forever? Didn't, I mean, didn't they pretty much hit the reset button on the game at some point during development?
6549000	6554000	I think they did. This doesn't appear to be either.
6554000	6556000	You know what I want to see is this.
6556000	6558000	Duke Nukem Forever.
6558000	6563000	And this just looks more polished, which is really bad.
6563000	6578000	You know what I want to see is this, but for Final Fantasy 13 versus, you know, before it became 15. I want because that's another one where it's like the trailer and the final game kind of aren't the same, you know, so I'd be very curious about that.
6578000	6588000	Quest Buster and chat says there was also a little drama when co-founder Scott Miller then blogged how Duke Nukem Forever failed and Broussard shot back because he felt as if you were thrown under a bus.
6588000	6598000	Yeah. And as Joe and Matt says, they're really bracing our expectations for a 21 year old demo. Just silly. Yeah. I'm like, we already the game ended up not being great.
6598000	6610000	So that bar is pretty low to hit for Duke Nukem Forever. Like we all play. Well, some of us played Duke Nukem Forever. It's like, you don't have to do much.
6610000	6614000	Even if it's a few test levels that might actually be better than the original.
6614000	6624000	Maybe it's the reverse than they think. And people seeing this demo will actually make people realize how much wasn't there and how much still needed to be done.
6624000	6640000	You know, they have like those they have like those God, there was some newer I think 3D Realms is actually making the games. They had some newer FPS games that were done in that like kind of old Duke Nukem style.
6640000	6654000	Like, I kind of wish they would just come back and make a new Duke Nukem game in that style like the old Duke Nukem. None of this like let's make it look modern. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The old one make it like the old one.
6654000	6668000	All right, well, something else that I wish they would come back and just make another of is f zero. But of course, as we've talked about the last couple weeks on the show, Reggie's going around doing a big book tour right now to support his book and of course a lot of people want to ask him about Nintendo.
6668000	6686000	So in an interview that he was doing with VentureBeat, Reggie Fils-Aime was asked, why no new f zero. And in a quote, Reggie says, Why was f zero abandoned? The insight I would share is that at least during my tenure, and he's always very good about saying I don't work for Nintendo anymore.
6687000	6702000	I can only give you you know, from my experience, we get it, we get it, Reggie. At least during my tenure, Nintendo developers were always experimenting with different gameplay styles, always thinking about where a unique experience could be applied back either to an existing franchise or maybe creating a new franchise.
6702000	6731000	My bet is that somewhere in the Kyoto development centers, some developers playing around with an idea that might be applied to f zero. It's never a situation, at least in my experience, where the company makes a conscious decision not to continue supporting XYZ franchise. Historically, it just hasn't worked that way. Not when I was there. I don't know if it's intended. But do you know what I hear in that statement is that they couldn't find a way to make the Wii controller compelling for f zero. So there was no f zero Wii.
6731000	6732000	That sounds like it.
6732000	6760000	They couldn't find a way to make the secondary screen on Wii U compelling for f zero. So they didn't do f zero for the Wii U. We'll ignore the Nintendo Land segment. And so but but now we're what we're on the switch. And it's kind of like, the switches compelling thing is that it's portable. And like that shouldn't be the argument anymore. It's it's like almost like any other console. I mean, I guess you could say that the joy con still detach and move around and all this stuff. But
6760000	6789000	yeah, but people are buying it for that gimmicks. They're buying it for the portability. Like they Nintendo needs to understand like you don't need to utilize the joy cons in just make them just controllers. And then if someone wants to utilize that, then they can. It's just like, you know, if let's go with their argument here that they couldn't do anything groundbreaking breaking with that. Nintendo also ignored their 3d component to the 3ds at some point. So like,
6789000	6810000	you know what made? So what put out another game? You don't have to just it's a racing game just and Bayonetta doesn't do anything but which I'm not knocking a legendary series. I love Bayonetta I will be getting Bayonetta 300% but I don't expect that it's going to do funny things with the joy cons and all that it's just going to be a
6810000	6833000	not like, honestly, honestly, when they've tried doing that, try to do funny things with the games, we are sitebox trick racing. Like, sometimes we don't need to put a new gimmick into it. Sometimes you can just make a quality game and have it run on your hardware, which is barely what some games can do nowadays on the switch. Because the switch isn't all that powerful. But like, just make a quality fc or game. Just make a quality game.
6840000	6845000	Make it look pretty, make it fast, make it, you know, the controls tight, done. That's all you need to do.
6845000	6867000	Nintendo to Nintendo's credit, when they do decide to make something compelling for the hardware, they typically knock it out of the park. And I would say Breath of the Wild is a shining example, which of course was was a Wii U game. And I know most people think of it as a switch game, but it was a Wii U game. And you know, everything that they do with this, the slate and everything just is, you know, but anyway, I digress.
6868000	6883000	I agree with SSG-100 Matt in chat. So they're overthinking it, just make a game already. It doesn't need to be that compelling. It's F-Zero, we'll buy it. And SSG-100 Matt said, so who at Nintendo thought Metroid Federation Force was compelling, asking for a friend? All of us.
6883000	6907000	And orange right says an F-Zero GX port would be great. Yes, like honestly, just put out F-Zero GX with the AX stuff already unlocked, because you're not going to find those machines anymore. And those memory cards don't even work on the switch anyway. And to most people, that is going to be brand fucking new content. Put out F-Zero GX AX in one package on the switch.
6907000	6936000	It's it's literally getting F-Zero GX a GameCube emulator to work on the switch with a little flag set that the AX stuff is already unlocked. Like I think there's a lot of people play GameCube stuff on my Mac. Yeah, I doubt it would be very hard. I guess I'll go to RetroArch. All right. Anyway, we've talked about some classic games in this segment. So I think it's time to get into a real classic segment here on OLR.
6937000	6957000	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
6957000	6966000	But once a month DarkSakura does a classic handheld. So DarkSakura, what is the classic electronic handheld of the month?
6966000	6969000	Tamagotchi.
6969000	6970000	Oh boy.
6971000	6986000	So I, I always kind of had the name wrong. I thought Tamagotchi was like for egg friend as in Tomodachi, but instead it's actually like egg watch.
6986000	7006000	So I was wrong. But it is a handheld digital pet keychain thing that was created by two people. One was Yokoi Akihiro of Wiz and Maita Aki of Bandai.
7006000	7022000	It was released by Bandai on November 23, 1996 in Japan and in the US on May 1, 1997. And it was a pretty big fad. I think everyone had one. Like I even remember there was like the Pikachu one. Remember?
7022000	7037000	Like the little walker thing that was yellow. I have one of those somewhere. But anyway, the majority of the Tamagotchi were in these little egg shaped video game things with like a couple of buttons on it.
7037000	7052000	And so Bandai said the name is a portmanteau of Tamago, egg, and Lachi as in watch. So I, I always thought it was for Tomodachi, but I'm wrong.
7052000	7071000	Anyway, so both of these people actually won the 1997 I.G. Nobel Prize for Economics as the father and mother of the Tamagotchi.
7071000	7088000	You could have like very simple little creatures in it that would evolve. You could discipline your Tamagotchi. If they were bad, you'd have to clean up their poo.
7088000	7105000	They had a hunger meter. You had to feed them and train them and play with them and you could check their age and their weight like little, like little pets and you could give them a loaf of bread or a hamburger or a snack that was like candy or cake.
7105000	7125000	And then you could fill up their happy meter by playing games with them and give them snacks. And if they needed to be disciplined, then you would scold them when they're trying, like when they refuse to play or when they want to be fed at the wrong time.
7125000	7139000	You know, like I said, you also have to clean up their poop. But they make a face before they take a poo. So you can activate a toilet icon and tell them to go potty. And then you can potty train them that way.
7139000	7160000	So if they get sick, they get a little skull icon and they look kinda happy and then you can give them medicine. Sometimes you have to play more with them or not play more, but give them more medicine to heal them. And usually they won't play or eat when they're sick.
7160000	7181000	And so they go through different stages of their life cycle. Each stage is for a few amounts of days, depending on the model of Tamagotchi you have. And it plays like a little jingle when it hits a new stage and changes the pet's appearance. They can die because you didn't take care of them or they hit old age or sickness or a predator eats them.
7182000	7184000	I didn't know there was a predator.
7184000	7202000	As like a later version, but they have baby, child, teenager, and adult, and the later Tamagotchi added seniors. And so, but if you don't take care of them, they can die. If they get super old, they can die and they can reproduce.
7202000	7221000	Also, some of the Japanese Tamagotchi have a ghost in the headstone when the pet dies, but the English version shows an angel at death or a UFO, and then a pet laying an egg so it returns to its home planet.
7221000	7247000	There are also the different versions. There's the Itamago that, of course, connects to this website, Flash Game, and it gives you a code so that you can log into it. And then there's also other models, like the Tamagotchi4u and Tamagotchi4u Plus, that can connect to other Tamagotchi units.
7248000	7259000	And also smartphones and tablets using NFC communication, but they do not have infrared, so that made them sell poorly.
7259000	7274000	There's also the different versions. The Mezuchi and Otsuchi Tamagotchi could have marriage and offsprings, and then that came with the Plus connection and the other subsequent models.
7275000	7288000	So a boy magochi and a lady magochi, I just made up those words, can get their groove on and make baby magochi.
7289000	7298000	You can also choose to have them marry a random pet brought in by the matchmaker. Like, what century is this, please? Thank you.
7298000	7305000	You know, matchmaker, matchmaker? Make me a match? Fiddler on the Roof? Hello? Anyway.
7305000	7306000	Yes.
7306000	7307000	The, hm?
7307000	7310000	No, I was going to say, yes, I do remember Fiddler on the Roof.
7310000	7313000	Yeah, that's my mom's favorite movie, by the way.
7313000	7320000	But you can, like, keep breeding your Tamagotchi and then their parents will leave them behind. Oops.
7320000	7333000	There's the Chōjinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi, also has character families or groups, and these are classifications for the characters that you can obtain in the game, mainly by appearance.
7333000	7335000	They also have certain skills that go with them.
7335000	7345000	The character of one group cannot grow into an adult of a different group, and if two pets of different groups marry and have an egg, the baby will be the one of the female group.
7345000	7357000	In Tamagotchi Mix, the latest one, there is a notable change that the Tamagotchi will share genetics from both parents. I think there's, like, an active store in Harajuku that you can still buy Tamagotchi.
7357000	7373000	There's so many different versions, just so many different mechanics in each of them. There's also the Tamagotchi Pix that has a camera installed, and you get a pet based on your skin tone and age of your face.
7373000	7378000	And then you can take pictures and take your pet on a walk.
7378000	7383000	So there are also video games, so we are getting into Tamagotchi video games.
7384000	7387000	God, there's so many different Tamagotchi releases, though.
7387000	7388000	You don't have to read them all.
7388000	7389000	Hold on just a second.
7389000	7392000	No, I'm looking at just the various lists of them.
7392000	7394000	How about some chat comments while you look that over real quick?
7394000	7396000	For fuck's sake, there's a bunch.
7396000	7404000	S2100Matt says, I remember friendships being ruined in school because friends would lend their Tamagotchi to their friends for the weekend, only to have them dead by Monday.
7404000	7407000	Home huge Tamagotchi.
7407000	7412000	Gadatz in chat has the crying emoji saying, I remember accidentally letting one die.
7412000	7416000	I'm sure dead Tamagotchis were very traumatic for an entire generation.
7416000	7423000	The last new Tamagotchi release was the Moto... I think it's ID or ID.
7423000	7435000	Ochi De Tamagotchi Station Plus that only exists with a Tamagotchi ID, and you can communicate three Tamagotchi IDs and have a dance battle.
7435000	7439000	There's also a Tamawaki that's a walkie talkie Tamagotchi.
7439000	7444000	Several people in chat are talking about the Pikachu.
7444000	7446000	It was like the Pikachu Walker.
7446000	7448000	A Pikachu Pocket or whatever.
7448000	7453000	Yeah, that was it. And they did a color one.
7453000	7455000	Now me, I was a Digimon fan.
7455000	7460000	I always, always ended up with Devimon for some reason.
7460000	7462000	I always did.
7462000	7468000	But there were a handful of games, and I think I can name the games pretty quickly.
7468000	7479000	So for Game Boy, there was Tamagotchi, Game Dehaken Tamagotchi, Game Dehaken Tamagotchi V2, Tamagotchi Otsuchi Tometsuchi.
7479000	7483000	On Nintendo 64, Tamagotchi 64, Mina De Tamagotchi World.
7484000	7490000	PlayStation had Hoshi Dehaken Tamagotchi Saturn had Sega Saturn Dehaken Tamagotchi Park.
7490000	7492000	Super Famicom had Tamagotchi Town.
7492000	7497000	The DS had Tamagotchi Connection Corner Shop Corner Shop 2.
7497000	7499000	We had Party On.
7499000	7502000	The DS had Corner Shop 3.
7502000	7506000	We had Tamagotchi no Furifuri Kagekiran.
7506000	7509000	More for the DS, all the rest of these are on the DS.
7509000	7516000	Tamagotchi no Nakiri Channel, Tamagotchi no Nakiri Challenge, Tamagotchi Collection, and Ochi Mainichi Tamagotchi.
7516000	7518000	That was for 3DS.
7518000	7526000	And then there were a bunch of iPhone, Android, and a Windows 95 Tamagotchi CD-ROM.
7526000	7528000	CD-ROM.
7528000	7532000	But I mean, there were so many Tamagotchi themed things.
7532000	7536000	There's a Tamagotchi Boeing 777.
7537000	7544000	There was the Bandai Tamagotchi statue that was in front of their headquarters in Taito.
7544000	7548000	Big Tamagotchi store, Tamagotchi anime.
7548000	7554000	That was where the Dehaken series came from.
7554000	7556000	Anime TV Dehaken Tamagotchi.
7556000	7559000	It basically means found on anime TV Tamagotchi.
7560000	7567000	There was also Saiko Tamagotchi, which is Hey, Let's Go! Tamagotchi.
7567000	7569000	All kinds of stuff.
7569000	7576000	There was animated videos, there was music, all kinds of shit.
7576000	7582000	And then there were the other... I'll talk about them.
7582000	7584000	There was a Pokemon Pikachu digital pet.
7584000	7588000	There was a Tatukibako, which also came out by Bandai.
7588000	7595000	There is a psychological effect named after Tamagotchi called Tamagotchi Effect.
7595000	7598000	I'm now very curious about that.
7598000	7604000	It has to deal with emotional attachments with machines, robots, or software agents.
7604000	7607000	There's one called P.O.L.E.
7607000	7611000	Pixel checks, one for girls.
7612000	7614000	Fin Fin on Teo the Magic Planet.
7614000	7617000	There was Giga Pets. I remember Giga Pets.
7617000	7619000	I had a Giga Pet too.
7619000	7621000	That was by Tiger.
7621000	7624000	And then, of course, Bandai also made Digimon.
7624000	7629000	All these people who were trying to say Tamagotchi and Digimon competing, blah, blah, blah.
7629000	7631000	They made Digimon too, as well.
7631000	7633000	The money all went to the same account.
7633000	7640000	And Digimon gave us the fantastic anime, of which I only count two of them.
7640000	7644000	And then Digimon Tri, because they were amazing.
7644000	7647000	Digimon Zero 2 is the best of the series. I will leave it there.
7647000	7649000	But I have my Digimon.
7649000	7653000	And he always turned into a Devilmon.
7653000	7655000	That's the end.
7655000	7658000	Tamagotchi, the classic electronic handheld of the month.
7658000	7661000	I think many of you know this, obviously.
7661000	7665000	Because it defined a generation in many ways, as far as gaming goes.
7665000	7668000	So, a little look back on Tamagotchi.
7668000	7675000	And how many of you first let a pet die from neglect?
7675000	7678000	It was Tamagotchi. I learned that lesson.
7678000	7683000	Well, if it was the Pikachu one, Pikachu would just run away.
7683000	7685000	Yeah, yeah. Pikachu never dies.
7685000	7687000	Pikachu never dies.
7688000	7691000	We're running a little long, so I want to make sure we get through our next few segments.
7691000	7695000	So, let's just get right into our rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other news in the industry.
7695000	7697000	So, Loki.
7697000	7700000	Yeah, Star Fields got delayed.
7700000	7703000	So, you know, that was expected.
7703000	7706000	But yeah, it's coming out now in 2023.
7706000	7708000	So, that's not going to be coming as well.
7708000	7712000	And Redfall, which is a game I completely forgot about.
7712000	7715000	I guess the new Arkane Austin game.
7715000	7719000	That is also coming out in the first half of 2023.
7719000	7721000	You know, I was looking forward to Star Field.
7721000	7724000	I really want to play Star Field, but I don't want him to crunch.
7724000	7725000	I want the game to be good.
7725000	7727000	Like, it is what it is. Whatever.
7727000	7730000	I just kind of wonder what Microsoft's holiday tentpole is now.
7730000	7732000	Because I thought this was going to be it.
7732000	7734000	So, does that mean Fable's ready for this year?
7734000	7736000	Or are they going to try to invest in something else?
7736000	7737000	I don't know.
7737000	7741000	I'm just curious what the marketing strategy ends up being now that this gets delayed.
7741000	7744000	I think this was their big tentpole for the holiday.
7744000	7746000	So, kind of curious where that goes now.
7746000	7748000	Yeah, no idea.
7748000	7752000	And then, in other news, data miners have dug through Nintendo Switch Sports.
7752000	7758000	And have found that there are 28 unlockable collections so far in that.
7758000	7765000	And 28 collections, meaning possibly over a year support for the game.
7765000	7770000	Half of them have been named and the other half have placeholder names.
7770000	7775000	There's one for each sport as well as random themes like ice cream, cute, and luxury.
7775000	7777000	I have no idea what the collections are for.
7777000	7780000	Is that like clothing or something in that?
7780000	7782000	I thought it was actual sports games.
7782000	7785000	I was like, oh man, they're adding 28 more sports things.
7785000	7790000	Oh yeah, it appears to be just like cosmetics.
7790000	7793000	Woohoo, cosmetics.
7793000	7794000	Hey, some people are into that.
7794000	7795000	That's true.
7795000	7799000	Some people have a bunch of cosmetics for survivors in Dead by Daylight and they don't play survivor.
7800000	7802000	I don't know who that is though.
7802000	7803000	That person's a bitch.
7803000	7805000	I would never out them on this show.
7805000	7811000	All right, anyway, speaking of said individual, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us next?
7814000	7821000	Okay, so Alan Wake remastered his coming to the Switch this fall.
7821000	7824000	Digital only and runs natively on Switch hardware so it's not emulated.
7824000	7826000	Woot.
7827000	7836000	And then Multiversis has a closed alpha set for May 19th through the 27th.
7836000	7843000	So if you want to play it, better go to the website.
7845000	7847000	All right, get on it.
7847000	7850000	I'll sign up for it, why not?
7850000	7851000	Why not?
7852000	7855000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
7855000	7858000	What's coming out a little sooner than Starfield?
7858000	7861000	Loki, what's coming out this week in the US?
7861000	7862000	Not a whole lot.
7862000	7870000	So we've got Dead Craft on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
7870000	7876000	And then Vampire the Masquerade Swan Song with excellent box art with a bloody swan.
7876000	7879000	It's like a swan with blood splatters on it.
7880000	7881000	That's it.
7881000	7882000	All right.
7882000	7885000	Well, let's go to Japan and check out the releases there.
7885000	7890000	We have on the Switch, Snow Brothers Special is out on the Nintendo Switch,
7890000	7894000	which I think is like an old school arcade game that's still going on.
7894000	7896000	Yeah, Snow Brothers.
7896000	7898000	We love Snow Brothers in this house.
7898000	7900000	Yeah, no, there's a new Switch game coming out in Japan this week.
7900000	7902000	I don't know if this is something getting ported over here,
7902000	7907000	but it's that same arcade series from back in the day with a cartoony look now.
7907000	7908000	So that's interesting.
7908000	7910000	So that is coming out this week.
7910000	7917000	We have Taiko Rishiren 5 DX is out as well on the Switch this week.
7917000	7919000	That is a remake, though, by the way.
7919000	7923000	And let's see, I think those are the big releases on the Switch this week in Japan.
7923000	7927000	Checking out the PlayStation 5.
7927000	7932000	The Ascent has a release in Japan this week, even though that is still the English localized version.
7932000	7937000	And that is really the big release on the PS5 this week.
7937000	7941000	So we'll move on to Europe, Dark Sakura.
7941000	7945000	Just a sec, because my browser decided to be a butthole.
7945000	7947000	OK, there we go.
7947000	7956000	So we also have on the 19th, we have Vampire the Masquerade, Swan Song.
7956000	7959000	This has like different artwork on it, I guess, for Europe.
7959000	7963000	We have Call of the Sea for PlayStation.
7963000	7966000	We have Castaway Paradise for Switch.
7966000	7970000	Luxo XXL on Switch.
7970000	7973000	The PlayStation Angry Alligator.
7973000	7975000	I'm sorry, on PlayStation Angry Alligator on Switch.
7975000	7979000	Jigsaw Fun Wonderful Nature.
7979000	7981000	And also Jigsaw Fun Greatest Cities.
7981000	7985000	PlayStation Switch Mickey Storm and the Cursed Mask.
7985000	7987000	We also have King Leo.
7987000	7993000	Also on the 19th, End Zone A World Apart Survivor Edition.
7993000	7998000	And on the 20th, we have Dolmen on PlayStation and Xbox.
7998000	8000000	All right.
8000000	8002000	We have some more news stories coming your way.
8002000	8005000	In fact, we have a few extra tonight because I screwed up making the show roll tonight.
8005000	8008000	But hey, that's all right. You get a little extra OLR tonight.
8008000	8011000	So why don't we get into it? Loki.
8011000	8020000	Yeah, so there's a class action lawsuit against Wada Games for their slow response, I should say.
8020000	8024000	Not eWada Games. Not to be confused with a legendary...
8024000	8028000	Wada Games, the company that does video game grading.
8028000	8031000	There was a few articles a while back about like, you know,
8031000	8035000	Super Mario 64 selling for a large amount of money and stuff like that.
8035000	8042000	I mean, aside from all of the, you know, heritage auction shenanigans that they've been doing since both companies,
8042000	8051000	I think you're owned by the same individuals or they're, you know, working together to basically inflate the collector game market.
8051000	8054000	So there's that.
8054000	8056000	But this is not actually about that.
8056000	8059000	It's about how long it's taking them to grade these games,
8059000	8068000	because Wada charges fees to expedite the process and a commission of two percent on games valued over twenty five hundred dollars.
8068000	8079000	However, their expedite process isn't very expedited and some folks are getting their games back after being in their possession for 18 months.
8079000	8081000	Which is ridiculous.
8081000	8088000	And mind you that these guys, absolute geniuses that they are at Wada Games are even opening up grading for modern games now.
8088000	8096000	So like how how are you going to do that when you can't even handle like what you have already?
8096000	8100000	You know, that's been like it. I don't know.
8100000	8105000	I don't know how they're going to pull that off when they can't even grade the stuff that they've had for like several years now.
8105000	8111000	I'm sure that there's going to be more investigations into them outside of this.
8111000	8120000	But, you know, obviously I would say that the them being slow to grade games is the least of my concerns as far as this company.
8120000	8126000	It's more of the artificial inflation of the value of the market because they're selling to themselves.
8126000	8130000	They I mean, they are basically grading.
8130000	8136000	They're saying that the games are worth this much and then selling it to themselves so that the market goes, oh, wow.
8137000	8142000	Mario's worth that much now. I'm going to sell my seal copies and stuff.
8142000	8153000	So it's it's a big old mess. But, you know, at least they're getting in trouble for just not being able to fill their basic.
8153000	8159000	You know, their basic services that they've offered.
8159000	8163000	It's that whole that we knew something was fishy with that auction thing from the very beginning.
8163000	8168000	And now I like that this kind of lays it out, though, with that, you know, big length of time and all that stuff.
8168000	8171000	So it's really interesting to see what the courts do about this whole thing.
8171000	8180000	So but chances are your copy of Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt isn't worth as much as some of these things would leave you to believe it is.
8180000	8185000	Yeah, but there are there are some video games that are worth plenty of money, like the stadium events.
8185000	8191000	And that's like before Nintendo bought it from Bandai. That's legit. But yeah, it's it's hard to find those anymore.
8191000	8200000	All right. Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, you know, kind of the newer end of games and games coming out on subscription services,
8200000	8207000	namely another comment on why PlayStation five first party games are not coming out on PlayStation Plus,
8207000	8212000	because a lot of folks are saying, oh, PlayStation Plus, they want the money answer to Xbox Game Pass.
8212000	8218000	And it's I mean, it's it's it's not the equivalent. We know that it is something that looks hilarious.
8218000	8226000	Had to do what was hilarious is like literally until you mentioned PlayStation Plus again, I for completely forgot that they had that service out there.
8226000	8230000	Like I remember games pass, but like I completely forgot PlayStation Plus.
8230000	8236000	Well, their PlayStation had the PlayStation now stuff and all that. I completely forgot that they even happen in a couple of weeks.
8236000	8241000	The whole really, really relaunches come in. So, you know, look out for that with the cloud streaming.
8241000	8246000	So, you know, I am so looking out for that. It'll be interesting to see what happens.
8246000	8257000	Anyhow, so the chief financial officer of Sony Hiroki Totoki didn't mention Microsoft by name, but we all know about Xbox Game Pass.
8257000	8268000	Right. So in a comment on a recent financial call, this is a translation by Genki JPN on Twitter.
8268000	8275000	If we distribute first party games on the subscription services, we may need to shrink the investment needed for quality products.
8275000	8279000	That will deteriorate the first party title quality. That is our concern.
8279000	8288000	Our current thinking is to have development costs and appropriate R&D investment for quality products, which will improve the platform and improve business in the long run.
8288000	8296000	Now, I know not everybody's going to like this comment I'm about to say, but I'm telling you it's the truth.
8296000	8304000	Sony feels that they can play it this way because the market is letting them because Sony is still leading in many ways.
8304000	8313000	Over Microsoft, Microsoft has been having to bring something unique and a new value type of thing to the table because they have been lagging behind.
8313000	8319000	Ever since they've the Xbox one launch was fucked so hard by dog matric.
8319000	8328000	And, you know, a lot of the incompetency that surrounded the release of that system, even if some of it ironically was ahead of its time, it didn't match the current time.
8328000	8334000	And we all know the Xbox one and the mandatory connect as the biggest mistake Microsoft ever made was mandating connect in the Xbox one.
8334000	8342000	But I digress is that it put them behind in the race and they've been having to play catch up ever since.
8342000	8352000	So I think Sony is able to kind of get away with this because if they put God of War out for 60 bucks, they put Horizon Forbidden West out for 60 bucks.
8352000	8354000	They put these types of things out for 60 bucks.
8354000	8363000	70. Oh, yeah, you're right. Sorry. 70 bucks. Excuse. Excuse me. Yes. 70 bucks. People are still going to buy it and they're going to buy it in mass.
8363000	8375000	Well, I think they're also playing it conservatively because they I think I think they can they can basically put this out now the way it is without the first party titles in there.
8375000	8385000	And then if Game Pass just utterly destroys them, they could put out the first party tiles and go, look, fans, we've been listening to you.
8385000	8391000	See, we love you guys. We put out first party titles now. I don't know, but I don't think it would be like that at all.
8391000	8399000	I think first party titles are still going to go on the service 18 months after they release when they would be given away as PlayStation anyway.
8399000	8413000	But it's yeah, that would be stupid, though. But like, it's going to be this may not be a problem right now there, but they're thinking very it's very much short sighted because, you know, Microsoft has all of these studios now.
8413000	8425000	And I mean, once these studios start developing stuff and like putting out these products, that's going to be a problem because right now they have some really quality games over their first party for at Sony.
8425000	8435000	And Microsoft has had a few things, but it's been like kind of hit or miss with some of that stuff. But then they're going to really start cranking out those first party tiles and they're not going to be able to make that argument anymore.
8435000	8446000	And it's just going to be. But they could still pivot and adjust their service, but they get it later if they feel the need to, or maybe they just don't think it's going to make a difference.
8447000	8460000	So at that point, we also know Microsoft is no longer as much about Xbox as they are about game pass. They want to sell more game pass subscriptions than they do Xbox is that is Microsoft's like environment now.
8460000	8469000	And that's fine. I don't think Sony is at that same pivot yet. Because again, they're still profitable in the hardware industry, they're still profitable.
8469000	8482000	So the market is not forcing them to evolve. And quite frankly, I think when PS5 VR comes out, it's just going to dig their heels in even more. I'm not sure they're they're going to pivot as quick as we all think they ought to.
8482000	8498000	I think a pivot for them to start including first party titles is going to be years away. And even then, I don't think it's going to happen the way you said Loki where it's like, Oh, we're listening, it's going to be one game is suddenly there's one big must have game that goes on the service day one.
8498000	8505000	And then that's like the thing that starts the floodgate. But again, I think we're years away from that. Hey, that happens anytime soon.
8506000	8513000	As they've been trying to play PlayStation now work for the longest time, and I don't think that's been really adopted. I don't think anyone cares about it.
8513000	8529000	Well, actually, so Matt says there's a story that came out that more folks are subscribed to PlayStation plus 48 million subscribers per Sony, then game pass 25 million per Microsoft, but only about 3.2 million for PS now, the market is off center now, but it will be a war soon enough.
8529000	8552000	There's a while your numbers, I'm not going to debate the numbers as you and her Mac is it's very true. There's a huge element here that people tend to overlook when they're putting those numbers side by side. And that is the entire country of Japan. Because Microsoft has not penetrated Japan to he at all the way they tried to for years and basically gave up on.
8553000	8558000	Did you say though that they're comparing PlayStation plus with Xbox Live?
8559000	8561000	Are we talking games pass?
8562000	8573000	Okay, well, you can't compare those because PlayStation plus you need to have for online access to PlayStation games. So if you're completely ignoring Xbox Live, your numbers are skewed.
8573000	8601000	Yeah. I'll be curious what those numbers look like in the US and in Europe. About six months, like we'll say this holiday season. I want to see what those numbers look like this holiday season in the US and Europe. No disrespect to Japan. Love y'all. But we all know Microsoft is a non factor in Japan and continues to be I'm not sure why that is. I would have thought Phil Spencer would have tried to remedy that by now. But that might that might be knowing him and the way he's playing the long game.
8601000	8630000	That might be something he's going to address with the next Xbox, whatever that is, the series Z, I don't know, whatever, whatever that is. But we all know Microsoft is a non factor in Japan. So you can't put those numbers next to each other. So I'd be curious what it looks like in the US and Europe in about six months. So yeah, Mike Dev to chat says I'm more compelled to keep game pass than I am PlayStation plus same. I still don't have a PlayStation five. Again, I will. I'm not a Sony hater by any means. I love Sony. I just I don't need one to play.
8631000	8650000	The current games because they all still play on PS four. I will buy a PlayStation five when Final Fantasy 16 is out. We are still thinking of getting a stream deck thing. Oh, yeah, this this steam deck, steam deck. Sorry, I have stream decks. I have two of those. No, I want I'm leaning back.
8651000	8679760	I want one of those now too. But I like my PlayStation five reservation. Now I want to wait for a hardware refresh. Because those things are only going to get better with time. So that's kind of where that's where my brain's at currently. Dijarama s says the Xbox Series S and x is actually selling well in Japan. I think that's an easy headline to write. Like because honestly, selling correct selling one console is selling more than zero. No, no, he's actually correct. They
8679760	8707840	are actually pretty good sellers there. It was the initial Xbox. With the current one, they're actually doing better at catering to the market. Hmm. But how? What's the rate? I mean, and this is I don't expect anyone to have these numbers handy. But again, I it's selling well, because the others didn't sell. So I would be curious what the ratio is of Xbox to Sony in Japan versus the ratio of Xbox to Sony here and in Europe, because I bet it's still pretty low. But I mean, good. Good.
8707920	8719440	2.3 million units in. Hold on, let me get to it. I hate cookies so much. Except real cookies.
8723280	8729280	Real cookies are great unless they have stealth raisins. Apparently the Xbox 360 actually sold a
8729280	8744320	bit better. But right now sales for the Xbox Series XS was at 142,024. But this is as of
8746160	8755520	March this year. It was the Xbox 360 was the best seller in Japan. And that mostly has to do with
8755760	8761040	with Dead or Alive and Star Ocean. That's but that's compared to millions of PlayStations.
8761040	8765600	So I'm just I just I feel like it's not a fair comparison to Japan. I mean, good, good that
8765600	8769360	Microsoft's gaining a little ground because I think they've earned that that ability. But I
8769360	8773760	think it will take a little more investment in Japanese developed games to get there. Microsoft
8773760	8779520	isn't buying any Japanese studios yet. I know everybody expects them to. But anyway, that's
8779520	8784080	that's a topic for another day. Let's move on. Let's talk about something else with Microsoft
8784080	8786160	and our Sakura. Something else they're doing well, right?
8786720	8796160	Well, you know, I'm all about accessibility. And we did have their adaptive adaptive mouse
8796160	8802160	that actually their adaptive controller that we had talked about so that people could play
8802160	8807440	could play their games and enjoy everything on Xbox. Well, now they have an extended range of
8807440	8815360	accessibility accessories. They have actually been partnering with the disability community
8816000	8820800	to make these and make them work. There's an adaptive mouse, adaptive buttons and an
8820800	8829920	adaptive hub so that you can augment these items with 3D printed accessories so that you can
8829920	8835600	customize them in ways that will best fit you. For example, for the adaptive mouse, it can
8836240	8841920	you can customize it with a thumb support and a tail extension or 3D printed tails.
8843120	8849600	With the adaptive hub, it can replace or augment a traditional keyboard.
8851520	8857120	They had one of the adaptive buttons that was concave and it had like different switches on
8857120	8863040	them. And the the person who they showed using it was actually born without her right forearm
8863280	8871600	and was using it pretty effectively. The mouse actually looks kind of comfortable, except I've
8871600	8879200	I mean, for those who were on watching live, I have to use a thumb track ball. But I mean,
8879200	8885280	it's it's it's a step in the right direction. The thing is, is that these do need to be affordable
8886080	8894000	for the community and not just like they need to have some sort of subsidy for the
8896400	8902800	for, I would say, like lower income or maybe even for businesses to have these to adapt to their
8903760	8910720	employees who may have a physical disability. That's something Mike Depp points out in chat,
8910720	8914880	too, is that good on Microsoft for this, but those adaptive peripherals need to be a bit cheaper
8914880	8919680	or more affordable, rather. Yeah. And.
8921840	8927760	They're like I'm I was looking at a few other people with other limitations
8928480	8933520	and these these things look pretty good. I mean, I have to say.
8936560	8940960	It's a little bit sad that they are just now doing something like this.
8941920	8946960	And other companies in the computer industry that I shall not name
8947600	8952240	have had switch controls and other adaptive technologies out well before this.
8953040	8956240	But I think it's a it's a it's a good start for them.
8957520	8962240	All right. I look forward to it. I'd like to try some of these.
8962240	8966800	Seems really interesting. All right. Let's move on to our next story from Loki.
8966800	8975200	Yeah, so we talked about all these other companies having allegations of worker harassment
8975200	8980240	and whatnot. Well, we talked a little bit about Nintendo, I think it was a few weeks ago,
8981040	8985600	how there is some former employees that filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint
8985600	8993760	against Nintendo alleging that they had surveilled course and retaliated against
8993760	9001280	the individuals. But of course, they have been very quiet as far as acknowledging any of this
9001280	9011600	stuff. So. We're waiting, I guess, to see what Nintendo does with this. I don't know,
9011600	9018080	like basically they're saying that, you know. Doug Bowser, I guess, made a comment,
9018640	9023120	but not really necessarily addressing it, saying that, you know, like many of you,
9023120	9028480	the executive leadership team and I find that many of these points troubling and we're working
9028480	9036560	closely to reviewing the content. That Nintendo's executives added that the company has a zero
9036560	9041920	tolerance for inappropriate conduct, including harassment, discrimination or intimidation.
9041920	9047520	Yeah, but you say that, but like, I don't know. But is it actually being done?
9047520	9055600	Yeah, it's a good reminder that like, you know, we have to like, typically the news cycle,
9055600	9058960	it's like, you know, oh, it's all over everywhere. And then a lot of companies will kind of ignore
9058960	9062640	it until it goes away. So it's like this kind of coming back kind of reminds people, hey,
9062640	9066560	wait a minute. Nintendo hasn't really done anything. But I wonder if it's going to end up
9066560	9070880	because wasn't it? Didn't a legal thing come out of that? I thought so. I wonder if it's not going
9070880	9075440	to be something that they have a complaint. I don't know if they follow the lawsuit yet,
9075440	9080720	but like, it would be up for that board to like the governing body to investigate them.
9080720	9083760	And if they found something, then I would assume it'd be like Activision.
9084320	9088560	Well, Ramah has a great point, too. This is a lot with the temp agency. So Ramah says that's because
9088560	9092800	a lot of this is being handled by temp agencies and they're blowing smoke up Nintendo's ass. And
9092800	9097840	I think that's absolutely true. That's a very unique element to this situation is that, you
9097840	9102800	know, and we talked at length about the whole, you know, struggle of the temp workers, especially in
9102800	9107520	the gaming industry, you know, a few weeks ago when this first came up. But yeah, it is another
9107520	9112480	interesting little because it allows Nintendo to kind of pass the buck, even though it's,
9112480	9119600	it's still your workplace, Nintendo. It's still your, you can do or not do whatever you want.
9119600	9124480	Anyway. All right. Well, let's talk about something. I think a lot of people are looking
9124480	9132240	forward to. Dr. Sakura. Well, I watched the trailers.
9133280	9139200	I have thoughts. What trailers? For Resident Evil live action series on Netflix.
9140560	9148240	It does not seem like it follows any established canon other than having things in common,
9148240	9156000	like locations and zombies. But it could be good as long as I tell myself it's not Resident Evil.
9157040	9164160	It looked like it would be a good show. This is also not to be confused with the adaptation,
9164160	9167520	the CG adaptation that came out on Netflix last year, starring Leon.
9168080	9176080	Or I need to watch it. I've watched the CG movies, the degeneration. I mostly got that because
9176800	9184800	um, uh, one of my favorite singers, uh, did the end song from it. Um, and then, uh, there's also
9184800	9191840	that live action movie reboot that has nothing to do with Netflix coming out. So we'll see.
9193840	9196960	I don't know, but it looks, it looks good as long as it's not Resident Evil.
9198480	9200720	But I have to know, does Master Chief has sex in it?
9202880	9204400	What does that have to do with Resident Evil?
9204480	9206960	Because the series is going on right now.
9208080	9214240	The joke is that it's the Halo TV series. The, I don't know if it's a show runner,
9214240	9219040	somebody that's high up in the process of making that show basically bragged that like,
9219680	9223440	we didn't even pay attention to the games. We didn't find out any information about it
9223440	9228080	whatsoever because we want to craft our own unique storyline. And it sucks. It's absolutely
9228080	9232080	terrible because they didn't follow any of the lore or anything that has to do with the show.
9232640	9235680	Whereas this also looks kind of similar. That's like,
9235680	9241200	well, it's sort of Resident Evil, but it's not really Resident Evil type of thing.
9241200	9244240	It sounds like it might be a thing that just explores something the games have it because
9244240	9248720	Tiger Claw says, I think this live action series mostly focuses on Albert Wesker's kids. Well,
9248720	9253680	is that something that the games have released? So my kids in the game, he was alone. Yeah. So
9253680	9258800	it's like, it's no, then that's a whole other thing. It's like trying to craft a new part of
9258800	9262400	the universe that hasn't really been explored, which the inverse I can think of, because we
9262400	9266960	usually see that done games for movies. And I think of like the Jurassic park telltale
9266960	9272320	game from a few years ago where they tried to turn the, do you remember the very first
9272320	9277600	Jurassic park Nedry draw? He's he stole the embryos from the other company or whatever,
9277600	9280640	or, you know, he stole the embryos from Jurassic park and then they, when he died,
9280640	9284800	the can fell into the river or whatever it was. Right. And that was the last you saw of it.
9284800	9291440	Well, the, the, the PC games kind of try to build a whole storyline out of what happened to that can
9292480	9297840	and that's where the PC gives us. So that way you weren't expecting Laura Dern because,
9297840	9301840	which is a shame because Laura Dern should be in everything, but you weren't expecting that
9301840	9305120	because this is a whole other part of the universe that hadn't really been explored.
9305120	9309520	But I should also point out those games weren't as well received as most of tell tales, other games.
9309520	9319840	So, so save though, that as a Marvel comics fan, I'm okay with alternate universes as long as it
9319840	9325520	tells a good story. I'm I'm definitely okay with multiverses after seeing everything everywhere
9325520	9330640	all at once, but I hear if I need to see that it's so I'll go see it again. We'll go. Okay. Let's
9330640	9336560	go see it. For me to understand, isn't that funny? I won't like, I won't watch Dr. Strange,
9336560	9340480	but I'll go see everything everywhere all at once again. That's so, that's so me. I'll see
9340480	9345120	one movie in the theater 500 times, Rocky horror, but I can't be bothered to see like,
9345120	9353440	want to see that, but people are saying that it reminds them of drag me to hell. And I hated that
9353440	9360560	movie. I'm more, I left that movie with regret. I've never seen drag me to hell. I liked it. It
9360560	9365680	reminded me, I follow all the MCU stuff, but it's a very Sam Raimi movie. I mean,
9365680	9370320	it reminded me like Sam Raimi movies, but I hated drag me to hell. Is it true? You have to
9370320	9374640	watch all of Wanda vision to get it because I haven't seen any of that. No, not necessarily.
9374640	9382000	I mean, some of it, the only thing from Wanda vision that you have to know is that she manifests
9382000	9388240	her kids in Wanda vision. And then obviously, because it was a spell that she did and she
9389200	9393920	decided the free, the town she was in, her kids are gone. And so now she's looking for
9393920	9396720	three VL just said the exact same thing. What were you gonna say to our soccer?
9399520	9404240	If you read old Avengers comics too, the same thing happened. They're kind of sorta,
9404240	9407680	except they ended up being part of Mafisto, which I don't think has anything to do with movies.
9409680	9413440	I haven't read any comics since I was, but it has to do with, I know it has to do with
9413440	9418560	the Darkhold. Yes, the Darkhold is very much in it. The Darkhold fuck shit up.
9420000	9422960	Some of you are going to take issue with what I'm about to say, but I won't give a fuck. This
9422960	9429040	is years ago. This is teenage Rob. I really read DC way more than Marvel back in the day
9429040	9436960	because I was a big Batman fan. So, and I like Superman, so sorry about it. But 15 year old
9436960	9443520	Rob makes no apologies. All right. Speaking of a company that won't make any apologies, Loki.
9446240	9451840	Well, I don't know if this is necessarily about apologies, but it's Epic Games has
9451840	9457600	managed to get a cheat seller to pay them for undisclosed damages.
9457600	9463600	I left out a very important word in the story sidebar, man. I made mistakes tonight. That's
9463600	9468160	all right. It's supposed to say Fortnite cheat seller must pay Epic Games. Go ahead.
9469440	9474160	Fortnite must pay Epic Games. They do that every time.
9474160	9477360	Oh God, people are looking at the thumbnail for the show right now thinking we're
9478160	9480560	just not with it. I'm going to change that right now.
9480560	9488400	It's like that co-commercial where they're suing themselves. So yes, apparently there is a guy
9488400	9497040	that was online. Brandon Despotakis, I guess he had infringed on Epic Games copyright and violated
9497040	9504560	I guess the EULA for Fortnite because he was creating, you know, aimbots designed to help
9504560	9514320	people cheat in Fortnite and also accounts loaded with skins and V-Bucks. And apparently he had to,
9514880	9520800	of course, they ordered him to stop selling the software and Froze's assets, which he had looks
9520800	9530160	like about a quarter million dollars worth of assets. And of course, you know, he now has to
9530160	9534400	pay them. And what's nice though is they're actually going to be donating that money to
9534400	9543840	Child's Play because they don't need his pittance when they're making their Epic money with Fortnite.
9544320	9551600	Oh boy. I mean, this Fortnite just keeps getting bigger and bigger and it's no surprise that,
9551600	9555520	you know, people want to try to make a quick buck off at one way or other, whether it's cheating or
9555520	9559120	whatever it is. It's just interesting that now this kind of stuff kind of like ends up in court,
9559120	9561200	you know? Yeah.
9561200	9567200	Yeah. I'm sure there'll be resolution through our expedient justice system in about 16 years.
9567200	9568240	So we'll see. Australia.
9568240	9571440	We'll see. Oh, it's Australia. Oh, nevermind. Then something might really happen.
9571440	9577120	So they've already filed the court documents earlier this month. So that's already done.
9578400	9582640	All right. I got one more story before we get to the listener round table. And speaking of our
9582640	9587120	Discord server where you can actually join if you want to give us a call tonight in our green room
9587120	9591120	over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
9591760	9595280	Another thing you can do in Discord is you can talk to us throughout the week about stories
9595280	9599040	that are going on. And this is one that was getting a lot of chat going on in our channel.
9599120	9606720	And this is one of those... It's a mess. And it's a mess of someone kind of put their foot in their
9606720	9612880	mouth and they quickly regretted it because they learned how fast sometimes news can spread like
9612880	9620000	wildfire. So let me try to summarize what was going on here. So Daniel Lindholm, who is a
9620000	9625120	composer for the Street Fighter series, he made an offhanded comment that Fei Long is never going
9625120	9630560	to come back to the series. He was doing a YouTube Q&A, which it's down, but you know,
9630560	9635280	once on the internet, always on the internet. And he said that... So he went on YouTube to do like
9635280	9641600	an ask me anything about Street Fighter. I worked on the soundtrack, which he should have kept his
9641600	9648800	answers to music and soundtrack. Although, well, to be fair, somebody kind of gotcha'd him a little
9648800	9653120	bit with this question, I think, but I just think he should have known what roads not to go down in
9653120	9658720	his answer. So a character that I know we won't see at all, and there's been a lot of discussion
9658720	9664080	about it. I mentioned earlier a character I would like to rewrite the music for, so that part is
9664080	9671120	true, would be Fei Long. I do have other sources, not only Capcom, but friends of mine in the US
9671120	9675200	who are very close friends with the Lee family. And they have basically said that any kind of
9675200	9680000	resemblance to Mr. Bruce Lee is now omitted for comedic effect, comic stuff. It needs to be
9680000	9686320	honorable. That's why we won't see Fei Long again ever. And he really put his foot in his
9686320	9690720	mouth on that because now he's saying he was speaking on a hypothetical language,
9690720	9695520	or excuse me, a hypothetical level. And he had sources close to the Lee family,
9695520	9703520	but not really from Capcom. And here's the thing though, and this is the part that doesn't click
9703520	9711600	for me. With all respect to the Lee family and the cinematic legend that Bruce Lee and for many
9711600	9718800	of us, Jason Lee were, they don't really get a say because we have the right to have parodies.
9719760	9725200	That's part of free speech and having parody. We're talking about Weird Al earlier in this show.
9725200	9729360	He's allowed to cover other people's songs and his own lyrics because it's parody.
9730160	9735280	He does respect them enough to ask. As I was about to say, he does get permission
9736880	9740800	and he doesn't put it out unless he gets that permission. I think with one exception,
9740800	9746160	he put out that Gaga parody, but that was a whole other thing because Gaga never gave,
9746800	9750960	never said, I don't want to do it. It was her people. And when she kind of found out,
9750960	9754720	she was like, I wish they told me about this because I see it as a rite of passage and I
9754720	9760480	would have absolutely said yes. But I digress. My point is he does get permission. He doesn't
9760480	9764960	have to. He just does that because he's actually a nice guy in the industry, but he doesn't have to.
9764960	9770560	But you've probably all heard the buzz about Coolio didn't care for it at first, but they've
9770560	9775040	made nice since then. Okay, let's not drag that out another 20 years. And there have been people
9775040	9782400	that have said no. Michael Jackson said no to a black or white parody. Although some of Weird Al's
9782400	9787760	most known, um, parodies are, uh, of Michael Jackson's songs, like eat it and things like
9787760	9793040	that. Right. Because of the message of the song and also, uh, Paul McCartney wouldn't let him do
9793040	9799280	chicken pot pie. Right. Right. Because he's a vegetarian. So, so, but, but, but Weird Al could
9799280	9806080	do those things without, and we've seen, we've seen many drag queens do parodies with X, like
9806080	9811200	lady bunny will do songs with extremely explicit song lyrics in the place. And she can do it
9811200	9819200	because it's parody. Lady bunny and her collection of wigs. So my point is I, I, from the start,
9819200	9824720	I was looking at this going, I mean, with all respect and maybe, maybe it is a respect thing.
9824720	9831600	Maybe Capcom did go to, but they don't have to at the end of the day. Um, so that, that from the
9831600	9837920	start was a little bit like was what's going on with this. I don't know. So anyway, um,
9837920	9844880	uh, so sorry, I'm re I'm reading the, the Weird Al discourse and chat, but it's, it's interesting.
9844880	9849680	Um, Eminem was okay with the song, but not the music videos as Bobby Black Wolf. I didn't know
9849680	9855680	about that one. That's interesting. And Bobby Black Wolf said, Coolio never said yes. His
9855680	9861280	people said yes. It was the opposite Gaga issue. The people made, well, the same issue. The people
9861280	9867280	made the decision without consulting the artists. But anyway, I digress. My point is I asking Bruce
9867280	9871120	Lee is a nice thing to do, but they didn't have, they don't have to do it. Nobody needs permission
9871120	9878160	to parody, uh, Bruce Lee because he's not Bruce Lee. He's Faye Long. So there's that too. But
9878160	9883520	anyway, and also it never happened. Yeah. And yeah. And also it never happened. So by the way,
9883520	9887760	Shannon Lee, who is Bruce Lee's daughter came out on the official Bruce Lee account to say,
9888320	9895360	we never made any comments of this nature. We have no idea who at Daniel Lindholm and I may,
9895360	9901920	I majorly respect the outright tagging. Like I'm not going to, I'm not going to snitch tag.
9901920	9907360	I'm going to tag you. So you see it. We have no idea who this guy says his close friends
9907360	9912800	of the family are, but his comments are entirely false surrounding the Bruce Lee family. And I
9912800	9918080	think our, our person in question here, Daniel Lindholm, you know, who's now blaming the podcasts
9918080	9924480	and the, the, the YouTube media and all that and Twitter for just running with this. It's like,
9924480	9930000	no, dude, you said it. I mean, did you think it was a news story when you said it? No,
9930000	9935040	but did you go on YouTube saying, Hey, I worked on street fighter. Ask me anything.
9935040	9939200	Thinking that nobody was gonna, if you said something of this nature that like Faye Long's
9939200	9942480	never going to be in it again, what you should, here's what you should have said.
9943440	9947040	A character that I know we won't see at all. There's been a lot of discussion about it.
9947040	9950640	I mentioned earlier, a character I would like to rewrite the music for would be fair.
9950640	9953840	Faye Long. Actually, he wouldn't have said, we won't see it all. He should have said a character
9953840	9958880	I would really like rewrite the music for would be Faye Long. Just like all of you. I really hope
9958880	9963600	we see him again soon. I wonder if there's reasons why we haven't seen him. I hope they're able to
9963600	9970160	work it out. Even that you honestly don't even need the second half. Just say, I'd like to do
9970160	9976080	Faye Long's music. Yeah. And that's it like, and tell us what you'd like about Faye Long's music
9976080	9982000	or what you would do, what your interpretation would be. That's it. What he should have said,
9982000	9987600	honestly, is like, it's been a Faye Long since we've seen, Faye Long time since we've seen him.
9987600	9992160	I wish we'd see him back in the game again. You need to throw in the pun. Always the pun.
9994560	9999280	Good night, everyone. And thanks for listening to OLR. Shoshana says, here's the thing.
9999280	10003280	You can say what you want. But remember, when you speak about the company, you're a contractor or
10003280	10007920	just a regular employee. You're still speaking for the company. Your words carry weight, represent
10007920	10012480	the company, and your words can damage the company. Don't be surprised if that company
10012480	10017520	doesn't invite you back if you try to speak for them. So on behalf of VOG Network, I would like
10017520	10025360	to say, fuck raisins. Raisins are terrible. California raisins ever done to you?
10026800	10032640	They taste bad. All right. I'm totally kidding. If people don't see the joke in that,
10032640	10039520	I don't know what to tell you. All right. Anyhow. All right. So yes, be careful if you're going to
10039520	10044080	do an Ask Me Anything about a video game. Don't get gotcha'd, and don't try to do this whole,
10044080	10048640	like, I have a friend of a friend, because it's so obvious. Something got lost in translation.
10048640	10052240	Dude, somebody told you they were a close friend of the Bruce Lee family
10052800	10057520	when they were nothing like that. They were nothing of the sort. They ran into them at
10057520	10061200	a convention once or something and asked an offhanded question that they filled in the
10061200	10065280	blanks to. Yeah, exactly right. E3VL, playing telephone.
10066080	10070560	My uncle is Bruce Lee, and he works at Nintendo, and he said that he's not going to be in
10071120	10072960	Street Fighter anymore. Yes.
10072960	10078720	I'm reminded of a quote of yours, Loki. That, Al, I shot myself in the foot. How did that happen?
10081520	10086160	All right. Let's get to the listener roundtable. We invite your chat comments with further
10086160	10092800	questions, your calls on Discord, and any emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com if there's
10092800	10097280	any emails. This may be a quick segment tonight. Oh, no, we do have people in the green room.
10097280	10100240	All right. Let's try to get quickly to some of these calls.
10100240	10101440	Well, we don't have any emails.
10101440	10106400	Okay. So let's do some quick calls. I'm going to get to it. Let's bring some folks here
10106400	10109440	live on the air. Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10110960	10112000	Zaku. Oh, my God.
10112000	10113920	Zaku. I haven't heard from you in forever.
10113920	10114320	Crap.
10115280	10116880	Yeah, it's been forever.
10116880	10119200	Have you come to serenade us with your dulcet tones?
10120160	10130160	Maybe. I am just finally able to do this on a regular ship. Sorry.
10130160	10133760	No, it's all good. It's good to hear from you. We're a little pressed for time tonight,
10133760	10135840	so I don't want to be rude or anything. It is great to hear.
10135840	10136720	No, of course.
10136720	10142240	First, I have to ask, Microsoft Flight Simulator, how awesome is that game? Because I know you're a
10142240	10144080	flight sim guy. How awesome is Microsoft?
10145760	10152640	I've tried it once. And yeah, it's pretty it's it is pretty awesome. But ever since
10153760	10157840	within the past few months, I've just upgraded hardware. So new video card motherboard,
10157840	10163200	the whole bang. And so now I'm in the process of just, you know, it's like moving into a new
10163200	10168720	house. It's like you have to set yourself up again with every had. And so I have to start.
10169600	10175600	I have to set up my flight simulator again. Mostly I've been doing a lot more DCS world,
10175600	10181680	which is like combat flight. So it took me like, so it took me like, God knows how many hours,
10181680	10187360	I'd say like four or five hours just to set up BF 18 key bindings and settings of VR.
10188000	10188400	All right.
10188400	10195120	Even on like a 3070 is just a lot of tweaking just to make sure the frames didn't drop. And I,
10195120	10201200	you know, be like smooth on VR. I just got a text from the spouse that says pizza and 10
10201200	10205120	wrap it up. So I have to get to your. Yeah, that's pretty much it. It's just
10207200	10212960	nothing much. I guess going back to conventions now, I went to PAX East almost a month ago,
10212960	10217600	almost got COVID. Thankfully, it all turned out negative. But, you know,
10218400	10222160	people were wearing their masks and following the guidelines.
10222960	10227040	Yes, there were a lot of mask wearing. You couldn't even eat anywhere you wanted to.
10227040	10232960	You had to eat in designated areas. But I guess like, people are saying like,
10232960	10236800	you know, there was a story about one of the pax enforcers who basically,
10236800	10241920	yeah, quote unquote, died of COVID. But based on what the what they're saying,
10241920	10248000	what I heard about that case, it doesn't, you know, unless they like, unless they examined
10248000	10253040	through autopsy, like what actually happened, it's really hard to speculate that someone died
10253040	10260720	of COVID. Maybe COVID was there and it was another contributing factor. But yeah, like,
10260720	10264480	it could be something else like this person also had like, comorbidity.
10264480	10268400	Well, I don't I don't like you know what, it's it's really tragic what happened. And I don't
10268400	10274400	want to speculate further, like, I don't want to speculate. And that's why, you know, people are
10274400	10280480	jumping to the conclusion that, you know, because a pax enforcer died of COVID that
10280480	10285120	maybe they should rethink the whole notion of having conventions entirely the problem because
10285120	10289280	now they can be done virtually. The problem is you can get COVID going to the grocery store,
10289280	10294720	you can get COVID going to the riding the bus, you can get COVID at your workplace, like it's,
10294720	10299200	it's, it's this weird thing where society has just decided COVID is over, but COVID
10299200	10304880	hasn't decided it's over. So I don't know, I don't know what the answer is. You have to,
10304880	10309360	you have to look out for yourself right now. And I kind of wish I could get another shot, but
10309360	10315200	whatever it is what it is. But Zaku, what did you get to play anything at PAX East? Like,
10315200	10321280	is there any games we should be looking for? That Ninja Turtles one, that was that retro,
10322000	10327840	that retro one. Otherwise, God, it's been it's been like weeks ago, but mostly like,
10329200	10337760	uh, I mean, this PAX feels felt different, because it felt more, more, more open. Well,
10338320	10344560	and like less dense than than previous years. Let's just say that makes sense, though. Yeah,
10344560	10349200	no, of course. It's like the first PAX in like two years. So well, it's kind of trying to get back,
10349200	10353040	it's probably laid out a little different, you know, kind of like Dark Soccer. Yeah,
10353040	10356560	with the pinball thing. And that's, yeah, it's not only that, it's like,
10357520	10362000	there's like whole sections where there would have otherwise been other rows of vendors
10362000	10367680	that were just like blank. And, you know, that helps with the spacing and whatnot. But
10367680	10373200	it felt different, because, you know, not many vendors of the past were there. And so,
10373840	10380000	you know, I, I guess it's due to the fact that people are slowly going back to conventions.
10380000	10385520	I know myself, the next one for me will be Otacon in the summer. But, you know, as it
10385520	10394640	stands right now, it's, it's hard. It's basically the whole, the whole pandemic was a shock to
10394640	10401200	anyone who, who did conventions on an annual basis. And so pick, it's basically like getting
10401200	10405680	punched in the gut, and then you're, you're writhing in pain on the floor, trying to catch
10405680	10409760	your breath. And then two years later, you get you pick yourself back up again and try
10409760	10416080	knowing to watch out for getting punched again, which in this case, COVID.
10416800	10421120	Well, Zaku, I hate to end on a negative note, but I have to for time. It's so good to hear
10421120	10423600	from you though. I'm glad you're doing well. And thanks for being here tonight.
10424560	10427520	All right. Yep. All right. Have a good one. All right. Bye-bye.
10427520	10430960	Bye. All right. Let's sneak in one more call here. Cause I see someone else waiting in the
10430960	10437200	green room. Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hey, it is the one and only it is
10437200	10442080	Ron. It's so good to hear from you as always, but you know, I have to make it quick. I'm sorry.
10442080	10447920	What's on your mind, buddy. All right. I'm going to make this quick as you want, but for the next
10447920	10453360	couple of minutes, I'm going to take y'all back. I'm taking the show back to the roots of OLR.
10453360	10460320	I'm talking B money and DDR because they just opened up a brand new Dave and busters in my
10460320	10467200	neighborhood, in my town. So me and a friend, we decided to go and play and see if we still
10467200	10472480	had the right stuff. Okay.
10478320	10485840	Getting old sucks, doesn't it? No, I fell off the dance pad. I rolled to the side and I was
10485840	10494000	just laughing for 30 seconds straight. At least you had fun. You didn't actually
10494000	10497440	hurt yourself. It sounds like you're good enough to call in and all that.
10498640	10503600	At least you didn't break your toe kicking the wall. I didn't want to say that, but yeah.
10504720	10510720	But it was, it was more like, you know, I played DDR at a con about a couple of months back,
10510720	10515120	you know, and when I got off the machine, I was like, Oh, I'm getting too old for this.
10516720	10520960	But me and my friend, we decided to play it. I'm like, you know what?
10520960	10525680	I'm going to put myself through these paces and see if I still got it. And we were mostly doing
10525680	10532160	stuff from fifth mix and we did three games and we were taking turns with other people.
10533200	10537920	I do not remember all of the songs that we did, but for the very last song, she says,
10537920	10541920	we're going to push ourselves. And I'm like, what do you mean push ourselves?
10541920	10545840	She pulls up max 300. I'm just looking at, I'm like,
10546720	10552800	I never did max 300, except once I was like, get 911 on standby.
10553760	10559280	You know what? They need to make a version of DDR called bitch. I'm 40. And it's just DDR. Oh,
10559280	10564640	ha star the kids version for back in the day. And it's DDR bitch. I'm 40. Oh, that and the spice
10565440	10574400	girls. I agree. I'm like, we need to have DDR for the grown folks. That's what we need.
10574400	10579520	Beginner mode, my friend. Revolution. That's what we need.
10579520	10581920	Grandma. I'm so sorry. I have to let you go. So we wrap the show,
10581920	10586720	but any other quick thoughts for us tonight? I was acknowledged by George Takei at the Japan
10586720	10593440	day parade. I saw that is I, I, you know, I try not to get into the whole celebrity culture thing,
10593440	10600160	but God, it feels nice. Sometimes it really does. It was, I made my day. What can I say?
10600160	10607440	Sally O'Malley, DDR edition. Y'all are wait till OLR's 30th. Rama, my friend,
10607440	10610960	great to hear from you as always take care. And my jam session. Listen to it. Bye everyone.
10611760	10612880	Bye. All right. Bye.
10613760	10620000	Why did I say bye? I don't know. All right. I meant to say, say bye everyone. Okay. Yeah.
10620640	10624640	It's about time for it. I can't find the right button. There it is. Okay.
10624640	10628480	We're going to wrap up. We got to wrap up. Thank you so much for being here tonight and listening
10628480	10631680	to orange on radio. If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the
10631680	10635200	show. Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more
10635200	10640800	voices to put out on air. So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or whatever you
10640800	10645600	use to listen to this podcast, Google play Spotify. I don't know. I really appreciate
10645600	10650640	it. Really appreciate that. I did see that. Bobby, Bobby is 29 again, a very happy birthday
10650640	10655360	to Bobby black Wolf, a little belated. I forgot to embarrass him on his show because we got onto
10655360	10660800	another topic and I have the memory of a turtle. So, um, happy belated Bobby black Wolf. And I
10660800	10666640	hope everything went well and I'll see you dragon con a few months. Um, that's it. Let's go around
10666640	10669440	and give everybody's final thoughts. Uh, dark soccer, your final thoughts tonight.
10670880	10675280	The survivors aren't being salty little bitches tonight. I drink their tears like for, uh,
10675280	10680240	in my coffee. All right. Have a good stream. Thank you. Take care. I'm popping out now.
10680240	10682960	All right. Yep. Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10683920	10687120	Uh, my final thought is I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.
10689360	10693680	My final thought is why is like, I know there's supply chain issues or whatever,
10693680	10697680	but why is everyone out of everything? Starbucks was out of sugar-free syrup,
10697680	10701360	which they only carry one flavor of sugar-free syrup now, which is the whole issue in itself.
10701920	10709120	And Chipotle was out of rice today. That's just the world. The world is ending. All right.
10709920	10713520	But in all seriousness, I hope to see you again in seven days for another episode of
10713520	10717440	orange lounge radio. I'm sure we'll all catch you on our personal streams or our
