0	12000	I'm going to spoil how tonight's show ends.
12000	13700	Our final thoughts on the outro!
13700	14760	Just kidding, that too!
14760	18060	But tonight we're ending the show with happy feels about a streamer finding a literally
18060	22020	priceless, authentically one-of-a-kind item and NOT holding it for ransom.
22020	25660	A rush of positivity to break the streak of headline topics that shall not be named, whose
25660	28940	value is 100% artificial and dubious to get there too.
28940	30980	This is a rush of serotonin and fuzzy feelings.
30980	33840	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about
33840	36480	this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show, where every
36480	39000	gamer has a voice.
39000	47100	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
47100	49280	where every gamer has a voice.
49280	56520	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 905 of our
56520	60380	show for tonight, March the 6th of 2022.
60380	65420	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always is Midna.
65420	69700	Say hello to Midna, licking and grooming herself back there on the chair.
69700	71260	On my bathrobe.
71260	73700	Being supervised by Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
73700	75340	Yes, she's doing quite well.
75340	77740	How are you, Dark Sakura?
77740	78740	I'm all right.
78740	81220	I've had a longer day than I wanted to.
81220	82860	I got a bad haircut on Friday.
82860	83860	Oh no.
83860	84860	Like really bad.
84860	85860	Oh no.
85860	86860	I had to get it fixed.
86860	87860	So hold on.
87860	90920	Oh, but your hair looks great.
90920	92600	It's a lot shorter than I wanted it.
92600	94280	Oh, it looks great though.
94280	96000	Well, thank you.
96000	99880	The back is still a little bit messed up, but she couldn't really do much else for where
99880	100880	it was cut.
100880	106640	So I'm going to get it redone in another couple of months.
106640	114000	So yeah, I had to wait 50 minutes to get in at Great Clips today.
114000	120040	I knew if I was going in for a blunt cut, they do a great job and they're cheap.
120040	124380	And I'm sorry to the podcast listeners because they cannot see your hair because it's audio
124380	125820	only when it's podcasts.
125820	130740	But remember we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash vog network at the
130740	136060	voice of geeks network, EOG network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after
136060	137380	the Bobby Black Wolf show.
137380	140500	And you can see things like Dark Sakura's fabulous hair.
140500	143720	And you know what, even if you're listening on the podcast feed, hopefully we get a clip
143720	144880	or two tonight.
144880	147640	Sometimes people clip the shows and you can see it that way.
147640	152680	Or if you want actually expect a Pantene moment for me, if you want the entire video archive,
152680	156820	you can always drop a subscription for a very, very small amount of money over at twitch.tv
156820	157820	slash vog network.
157820	162880	In fact, if you're a prime Amazon prime person, you get a free sub every month.
162880	164560	So why not spend it at vog network?
164560	166460	Don't let it go to waste.
166460	169720	Someone who I know spends lots of his prime subs at vog network.
169720	171800	Say hello to tech master Loki.
171800	172800	Actually it's not true.
172880	175360	We don't spend actual subs on our network.
175360	177280	I don't know where the prime one goes.
177280	178840	I was just at my transition.
178840	181360	There could have been better, but that's all I had.
181360	182360	What is it?
182360	187220	Is this is that supermarket scream that game that just came out of the supermarket streak.
187220	188220	That's it.
188220	191480	I was like, I played that cause the listeners were saying I should check that out and it's
191480	192480	cute.
192480	196160	And I like the one you have to yell into a microphone thing.
196160	197160	I think so.
197160	198160	Yeah.
198160	199160	It's a mechanic.
199160	200680	I think it's an optional mechanic though.
200680	201680	I'm pretty sure.
202400	207080	So, um, and I did, I also, uh, to go back to dark soccer real quick, I wanted to compliment
207080	208080	your R-type shirt.
208080	209080	I see you wearing.
209080	210080	Oh yeah.
210080	211080	I'll stay there.
211080	212880	We got a lot of classic gamer paraphernalia.
212880	214520	Oh yeah, I do too.
214520	219760	I just, it's under my shirt, so I have to like, you know, don't take your clothes off
219760	220760	on air.
220760	224680	That's against TOS, but like, oh, that's an awesome shirt.
224680	225680	Wow.
225680	226680	And wait here.
226680	227680	Hold on.
227680	228680	Hold on.
228680	231560	Cause hi, by the way, uh, since the last episode I've worked on my sound and I think tonight
231560	234680	should be a lot better, uh, from the sound perspective.
234680	235880	So yeah, there we go.
235880	241800	Uh, basically a long story short, I was using a setting on gain that worked for my personal
241800	244080	streaming, but it was really bad for podcasting.
244080	247360	I have now fixed my setup to look a lot like dark soccer and Loki.
247360	249440	And that's actually what I thought of is I was like, you know what?
249440	251920	I bet it's because the gain is just too high.
251920	255240	I need to put it on the lowest setting and have the mic right in front of my face.
255240	257660	And sure enough, that is the, that is the trick.
257660	259900	And then I have a brand new pop filter as well.
259900	264420	So I can say words like popcorn and it won't drive people crazy anyway, but behind this
264420	265420	is my shirt.
265420	266420	I found this one.
266420	267420	I was moving.
267420	268420	You ready?
268420	269420	You ready?
269420	275780	Nice lens arcade 1983 is what that shirt says.
275780	276780	Nice.
276780	278380	I don't think I've worn that since 1983.
278380	279380	No, just kidding.
279380	283980	It was a, it was a more recent than that, but it's one of those shirts that got like
283980	287740	at the bottom of the closet, at the end of the shirt pile and just didn't wear it for
287740	288740	forever.
288740	291900	And then as we were moving, I was like, Oh, this shirt, I need to put this back up on
291900	292900	top of the pile.
292900	293900	It's nice.
293900	296980	Incentivizes you not to have a shirt pile.
296980	297980	Absolutely not.
297980	299700	We have too many shirts, dark soccer.
299700	300700	That's a problem.
300700	301700	Too many shirts.
301700	302700	That's it.
302700	303700	Your house for me present is coat hangers.
303700	304700	Actually.
304700	306620	Well, we got for t-shirts though.
306620	307620	We have plenty of coat hangers.
307620	308620	I hang up all my t-shirts.
308620	309620	Really?
309620	310620	We don't hang up the t-shirts.
310620	311620	We fold them and put them in drawers.
312260	316060	Well, I mean, I have like my tank tops are all folded up, but most of my t-shirts get
316060	319420	hung up so they don't get like super wrinkled.
319420	325780	We used to fold them and put them in a drawer for t-shirts for like work button up shirts,
325780	331220	like, like Loki's outer shirt that I would have on a closet if I own that, but I don't.
331220	334940	Anyway, enough about closet life.
334940	341040	Wait until you see the closet at this place though, dark soccer, you're going to be like,
341040	342620	you came out of the closet.
342620	345340	Why do you have such a big closet now?
345340	347120	Is it bigger than my closet?
347120	348120	Yes.
348120	349860	I keep joking with Alan.
349860	352040	It's my drag closet, which I don't.
352040	354360	Cause I have a pretty big walk-in closet.
354360	355840	All right.
355840	357480	I'll show you when you're here.
357480	358480	Anyway.
358480	361000	So that'll be the guest bedroom then, right?
361000	365760	No, the guest bedroom kind of pairs with, well, actually we have a legit, we have a
365760	368980	legit Harry Potter room under the stairs.
368980	372620	And I keep joking that we're going to put like a love sack in there or something.
372620	376980	And that can be the, I told you I've slept in one of those before, right?
376980	382180	That was like episode two of OLR, which you were on a trip.
382180	385520	They had to clean the mattress very well before I was sleeping on it.
385520	389260	So just letting you know, it was the frat house.
389260	393440	We're going to go on and get into gaming news for tonight.
393440	397460	And actually starting with a little bit of a look back because I, this, and this is one
397460	401540	of the things where, you know, when we talk about how old something is in gaming, which
401540	406300	happens a lot during the classic game of the week, we have a moment of, Oh my God, really?
406300	408340	Like, Oh, I feel so old.
408340	411380	I don't know if tonight is one of those, but it's one of those that kind of surprises me
411380	413020	that this has been around this long.
413020	419400	And that is the Nintendo switch this week, uh, as of March 3rd, I believe turns five
419400	420520	years old.
420520	424220	The Nintendo switch has been out for five years.
424220	426880	Just me saying that, does that surprise you?
426880	428680	Does it felt like five years?
428680	429680	Loki?
429680	436460	Uh, no, because I don't think I picked it up right when it came out, but I don't really
436460	439980	keep track of time for that system.
439980	444040	I guess I can't really remember when like any of these last few systems came out.
444040	450480	I remember like the Xbox three 60 and like that generation of systems, but the last two
450480	452680	generations I'm not really keeping track.
453120	458800	Well, I think also for me, like the pandemic has been a big, like warp on time, you know,
458800	462760	like, um, make a play a pun on Mario and talk about warping.
462760	466720	Like I feel like the pandemic has really warped sense of time.
466720	470900	And although, you know, perhaps one of the biggest highlights of the Nintendo switch
470900	477320	has been the fact that it was there for animal crossing, you know, when we all needed it
477320	483800	in March of 2020, um, it's just kind of fascinating to think like, Oh yeah, like the, this, that
483800	485480	system has been around five years.
485480	488640	I don't even really know where the last two years really went.
488640	489640	I don't know.
489640	490640	That's how I feel sometimes.
490640	491640	Yeah.
491640	495400	I'm going to chat and looking at some comments there, because again, we do tape live over
495400	497280	twitch.tv slash vog network.
497280	501900	And I like to read comments from chat, including Zen monkey 11, who says the switch feels like
501900	503560	seven years.
503560	504560	It's annoying.
504600	505600	Um, let's see.
505600	510880	Fifth dream says five years time to obsolete every game and resell them on a 10% upgraded
510880	511880	switch too.
511880	517560	Well, fifth dream, you know, there's a lot of speculation that a switch pro was supposed
517560	522760	to happen and didn't because of, um, the pandemic basically long story short.
522760	526880	Well, there is, uh, the, I don't know if we have a story on it or whatever.
526880	533200	There's a, a hack that happened with Nvidia or yeah, we talked about it last week.
533200	537200	Um, I think the hack came up last week, but I'm not sure the switch thing came up until
537200	538200	this week.
538200	539200	Yeah.
539200	543620	The, some of the stuff that was in there was a chip set that was allegedly for them new
543620	544620	switch.
544620	545620	Yeah.
545620	546620	Fascinating.
546620	552960	Well, I mean, Nintendo working on a new console, of course they are eventually.
552960	553960	We know that, right?
553960	555240	Just like, Hey, guess what?
555240	557120	Sony's working on a PlayStation six.
557120	558120	Yep.
558120	559120	They are.
559120	562240	That doesn't mean it's coming out this year or anytime soon, but Sony is working on the
562240	563840	PlayStation six.
563840	564840	Believe it.
564840	568720	Microsoft is working on the Xbox, whatever, whatever they're going to call it.
568720	569720	Absolutely.
569720	575680	So, um, let's see, uh, other comments from chat here, uh, E3VL says, I don't feel like
575680	577860	they'll do a switch to anytime soon.
577860	580280	There's Mario Kart eight deluxe DLC.
580280	585720	That certainly does seem to mean that like Mario Kart nine, but what if Nintendo were
585720	591960	to like, I don't know, actually do backwards compatibility, uh, a little better.
591960	595960	And that even if you bought that Mario Kart eight stuff, it'll work on your next system.
595960	596960	Who knows?
596960	597960	Weird.
597960	601400	Nintendo used to be like the Kings backwards compatibility, which is weird because super
601400	606540	Nintendo and Nintendo weren't exactly backwards compatible, but like we had the game boy player
606540	609160	on the super Nintendo, which kind of opened some things.
609160	610520	It's just so weird.
610520	615800	How things have come full circle in that regard where Nintendo now is like, they're not great
615800	616800	at it.
616800	621160	You know, we had that whole bit last week about how would the Wii U going away, there's
621160	625280	not really going to be as many games that are archived because of rights issues and
625280	631000	bad about about, um, did you, Rama S says we need a 3d S player for switch.
631000	632000	Absolutely.
632000	633000	Absolutely.
633000	637600	You could flip a switch on its side, meaning like a vertical screen and emulate a 3d S
637600	638600	easily.
638600	639760	I really wish they would do that.
639760	642360	I really, really wish they would do that.
642360	645360	Um, let's see.
645360	648120	There was one other comment here I wanted to read.
649080	654680	Tiger class says the fact that switch is five years old is a testament to its longevity.
654680	660560	Well, speaking of that, there are some sites that are talking about and having a nice look
660560	666240	back on, or, or yes, look forward to this particular year and how, yeah, the switch
666240	671020	is five years in, but this seems like it's going to be its biggest year yet.
671020	675760	And I'm looking specifically at an article on Engadget, one of those tech websites, um,
675760	680100	that does a lot of, um, you know, uh, blogs and things about what's going on in the tech
680100	681100	world.
681100	682100	And they write about gaming as well.
682100	683360	That's where joystick used to be.
683360	685600	Remember, remember joystick years and years ago.
685600	689260	Um, and they're running an article this week that says Nintendo switch is about to hit
689260	691000	its prime.
691000	695720	And it's interesting because they're talking about, okay, so the Nintendo gave us Zelda
695720	697900	breath of the wild.
697900	701280	Technically the Wii U gave us that, but I, I get the point.
701280	702280	Yes.
702280	705440	Uh, things like Xenoblade Chronicles two splatoon two and so forth.
705440	713040	And then it talks about this year, Pokemon legends, Arceus, Arceus, Arceus, whatever
713040	714880	that game came out in January.
714880	715880	Right?
715880	716880	So that's the start of the year.
716880	723280	Then we find out last week, Pokemon, violet, Pokemon, scarlet, late 2022, Kirby in the
723280	724440	forgotten land.
724440	727160	Just got a demo this week that some of you are playing, right?
727160	731040	That's going to be out in March legend of Zelda breath of the wild too.
731040	733480	They're saying it's 2022.
733480	734480	They're saying that.
734480	738000	Well, we'll see, but we're, they're saying it splatoon three.
738000	742380	Maybe that's why Pokemon stuff's coming out at the end of the year now.
742380	748540	Splatoon three this summer, Mario and rabbits, sparks of hope coming up, Bayonetta three,
748540	749540	it's real.
749540	754440	And it's coming out in 2022 advanced wars, one plus two, no man's sky.
754440	759800	Finally getting ported an oxen free sequel, Xenoblade Chronicles three, Wii sports, but
759800	765080	for the switch switch sports, a new Mario strikers title, you see where I'm going?
765080	772600	This year is fucking stacked for the Nintendo switch, especially compared to 2020 and 2021.
772600	773800	I mean, don't get me wrong.
773800	778960	Animal crossing was absolutely bad-ass and huge for 2020, but we know in a lot of ways
778960	784680	the pandemic kind of messed with things in a way where I think a lot of games that probably
784680	785680	would have been out sooner.
785680	789400	I think Arceus really was supposed to be last year.
789400	793720	It really was, but it's been delayed for a variety of reasons and whatever it came out
793720	794720	this year.
794720	798480	I think there's a lot of things where the pandemic just threw the timetable off animal
798480	799520	crossing DLC.
799520	802400	I think that's part of the reason that took so long as well.
802400	809720	So it seems like just now everything is hitting this year, but it is interesting for a system
809720	814480	that we keep saying, Oh, they're going to do a switch to, Oh, there's a switch pro.
814480	816640	Oh, there's all of this coming.
816640	821240	Why this year so fucking stacked for the Nintendo switch.
821240	825680	Let me ask my co-hosts if they have any perspective on this.
825680	832480	Why is 2022 so stacked for the Nintendo switch compared to 2020 and 2021?
832480	837640	This stuff got delayed until this year.
837640	843120	How about development, hardware shortages for development?
843120	844680	Like dev kits and things like that.
844680	845680	Yeah.
845680	850360	And part of the problem could be, could be, I mean, some of these are Nintendo's own studios,
850360	851360	but I get it.
851360	852360	I get it.
852360	856960	You know, if it's not even just maybe development from the sense of the actual professional
856960	861200	hours, we know that was all disrupted because of the pandemic.
861200	862200	Absolutely.
862200	867640	There's that, um, looking in our chat room, uh, SSU 100, Matt is actually asking a question
867640	873680	of the chat with five years of having the switch has your console been docked or undocked
873680	874680	most of the time.
874680	876000	I think that's interesting.
876000	877280	We have a few answers here.
877280	881960	Uh, E3 VL says docked, except when I need to take a number two, thank you.
881960	886040	Uh, I'm going to assume taking your S your second switch, we'll just leave it at that.
886040	887040	Um, let's see.
887040	891040	Uh, as Joe and Hunter, Matt says undocked, I only really have it docked when it's smash
891040	897200	or Mario party, uh, for me docked 98% of the time.
897200	903960	And the 2% is when I was traveling pre COVID going to things like, um, dragon con I'll
903960	909160	take my switch to dragon con, but that's otherwise like most of my game, I love to play it on
909160	914000	the plane, but otherwise most of my gaming is a absolutely docked mode.
914000	919440	Uh, Bobby black Wolf says it was docked a hundred percent of the time until P cross
919440	920760	came out.
920760	924180	And now the switch lives next to my bed and you know, what's interesting.
924180	928580	My husband, Alan finally bought a switch for animal crossing, but he bought that switch
928580	931820	light, which can't even be docked.
931820	933660	So for some people, it's not an option.
933660	936580	If you bought a switch light, you don't have a dock.
936580	938940	He can't even put his switch in my dock.
938940	940420	It doesn't work that way.
940420	947240	So that sounds like a thing that we don't need to hear about.
947240	953940	All y'all need religion, Jesus, whatever, seek it anyway, I tried that whole Jesus thing.
953940	954940	It didn't work out for me.
954940	959620	I said, whatever, whatever is my all encompassing anyway.
959620	961380	Um, yeah.
961380	964220	Orange Wright says 99% of the time it's docked.
964220	965420	Uh, yeah.
965420	971660	So, so it is interesting that this year seems to be such a big year, but I also understand
971660	977340	the skepticism that they're saying breath of the wild too, is going to be this year,
977340	982420	but I'll believe it when I see it, we still don't even know the official name, but I bet
982420	983420	we will get the name.
983420	989940	We will get the name at I'm using quotey fingers E3 intent, which I think should really be
989940	993240	called Nintendo's summer direct at this point.
993240	999520	I don't think there is any really, um, w we'll just wait for the dice to fall and officially
999520	1004020	make that a reality, uh, or orange right says summer games Fest.
1004020	1005020	Sure.
1005020	1006020	Okay.
1006020	1007020	Sure.
1007020	1010380	If we, if we want to give Jeff's ego that, sure.
1010420	1012300	Uh, Nintendo summer announcements.
1012300	1013300	We'll see.
1013300	1014300	All right.
1014300	1020580	Um, I know we talk a lot about video games to escape, um, the realities of the real world,
1020580	1023140	but, um, there's a lot of big shit going on in the real world.
1023140	1027420	We talked a little bit about it last week and yes, it affects gaming and yes, gaming
1027420	1028420	is involved.
1028420	1029420	Dark soccer.
1029420	1035380	I think you have a piece on the latest with, um, how, uh, Vladimir Putin's war is affecting
1035380	1036380	the gaming industry.
1036380	1037380	Right?
1037380	1038380	Yeah.
1038380	1044460	Um, basically everyone's like, fuck you, Russia, at least everyone with a conscience
1044460	1049820	or at least a corporate conscience, I should say, um, and actually, can I quickly say hats
1049820	1057220	off to the thousands of protesters in Russia speaking up against thousands of people were
1057220	1058940	like detained in Russia today.
1058940	1064180	So props to the people, um, cause I know there's many, many, many, many within Russia that,
1064180	1065540	um, don't like it.
1065540	1069900	Um, and props, props to people for being able to stay informed, even when they're really,
1069900	1072540	really trying not to let you be anyway.
1072540	1073540	Sorry.
1073540	1080020	So basically though, we've had EA, um, pull their product from, uh, Russia.
1080020	1081620	We've had CD project.
1081620	1087620	It's based in Poland, even the makers of cyberpunk and the Witcher, uh, gaming franchise, uh,
1087620	1090380	halt all of their sales in Russia and Belarus.
1090380	1094220	Um, and all the sales through GOG in those countries.
1094220	1101260	Um, also, uh, of course the, the, uh, Ukrainian president has, uh, or prime minister, I should
1101260	1110300	say, has, uh, issued his own statement, um, where he's appealed to, uh, uh, different,
1110300	1116900	uh, I'm going to say just different, uh, facilities in the democratic world.
1117140	1122220	Um, in fact, one of the quotes on here says, I appeal to temporarily block all Russian
1122220	1127020	and Belarusian accounts, temporarily stop the participation of Russia and Belarusian
1127020	1132820	teams and gamers in all international esports events and cancel all international events
1132820	1138660	holding the territory, uh, uh, I, it's the translation on here is a little funky, uh,
1138660	1142100	holding in the territory of Russia and Belarus.
1142100	1146140	We are sure that such actions will motivate the citizens of Russia to proactively stop
1146260	1149180	the disgraceful, uh, disgraceful military aggression.
1149180	1151980	Sorry, that's the deputy prime minister.
1151980	1160100	Um, so yeah, um, on top of that too, now, uh, the, the first, uh, bit of information
1160100	1165260	I found on it, uh, it was a little out of date as of the 6th, um, but various other
1165260	1172500	companies have added their names to the list, uh, Apple has stopped selling, uh, uh, games
1172500	1178900	on the app store, Apple maps is, uh, disabled for the safety of Ukrainian citizens, uh,
1178900	1179900	in the Ukraine.
1179900	1187220	Um, also Apple pay is limited in Russia, Microsoft, it has a suspended sales of its products and
1187220	1192300	services and, uh, pumping up the cybersecurity in Ukraine.
1192300	1196920	Google says that Russia can still use Google search engines, but they've suspended its
1196920	1198740	advertising business.
1198740	1203940	So that's all ad revenue for YouTube searching, other forms of Google sponsored marketing,
1203940	1209580	um, and Google maps features have been disabled, um, although they are still providing info
1209580	1214820	on refugee sources for people fleeing the Ukraine, Samsung has also suspended their
1214820	1222160	shipments to Russia as of this past Friday, the 4th, um, TikTok, uh, is suspending live
1222160	1224560	streaming and new content to Russia.
1224560	1231720	Um, they are doing it because there are some, it's actually based on the fake news law in
1231720	1236400	Russia saying that they need to make sure that the information that goes out is, is,
1236400	1238880	isn't spreading misinformation.
1238880	1245720	Snapchat is also, um, halted all ad sales, although the app will still remain for communication.
1245720	1250720	Airbnb is offering temporary free housing to a hundred thousand Ukrainian refugees and
1250760	1254120	waiving hosting guest fees for booking in Ukraine.
1254120	1261360	Um, I've heard people here booking Airbnbs in Ukraine, they never intend to stay at because
1261360	1264400	they're just trying to give money to people that need it.
1264400	1269800	I thought that was a fascinating, uh, it's the paying, not staying is what it's called.
1269800	1270800	Oh, okay.
1270800	1276240	Uh, Disney is also halting all theatrical releases, uh, releases in Russia, including,
1276240	1279000	uh, the Pixar film turning red.
1279000	1282400	Sony has stopped, uh, theatrical releases in Russia.
1282400	1287560	PlayStation 5 though is still on sale, um, and they are under a lot of pressure to stop
1287560	1289400	sales of their gaming consoles.
1289400	1292080	Uh, Warner Brothers is not releasing Batman.
1292080	1299960	Uh, Paramount is halting all theatrical releases, including, uh, the Sonic sequel and Lost City.
1299960	1301760	Universal is doing the same.
1301760	1307860	Nintendo has placed, uh, its Russian eShop in maintenance mode, meaning it is unavailable
1307860	1310580	and gamers are locked out of purchasing new games through the service.
1310580	1314660	Uh, EA, like I said, has stopped selling in Russia and Belarus.
1314660	1320300	Intel has suspended all shipments to customers in Russia, uh, in Belarus, including their
1320300	1321300	chips.
1321300	1325860	Uh, Netflix paused all projects and acquisitions in Russia and refused to run state run channels
1325860	1327860	and on their service in Russia.
1327860	1332620	Uh, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda scaled back all their operations as well.
1332620	1338300	Uh, BMW stopped production in Kaliningrad and halt exports to Russia.
1338300	1343940	Ford is stopping effective immediately, GM is as well, and Honda has also suspended their
1343940	1344940	exports.
1344940	1349420	So that's just the overall, like, list of companies that have come into it, not just
1349420	1355780	our gaming system, gaming services, but we have, you know, and actually the, the good
1355780	1364620	thing about, um, Google, um, you know, basically anything that offers, uh, mobile apps is that,
1364620	1370260	um, that is the majority of the Russian gaming market is mobile apps and steam, uh, which
1370260	1373540	I haven't seen anything though about valve yet.
1373540	1377820	Um, as of the fourth, it looks like valve hadn't made a comment.
1377820	1380340	There could be something since then, but I haven't seen it.
1380340	1385380	Um, I actually do want to quickly go back to the Nintendo Sony thing because we do,
1385380	1390340	you know, thanks to this show going worldwide, um, and we have folks that participate with
1390340	1391340	the show.
1391340	1395820	Um, if they're not here live, um, potentially in our discord server over at vog network.com
1395820	1400340	slash discord, and we do have a listener who I know is in Russia, uh, who doesn't listen
1400340	1403820	live probably because of the time zone difference, but listens on the podcast.
1403820	1407620	And this listener is actually kind of giving us some insight as to what's going on over
1407620	1408620	there.
1408620	1413720	I'm commenting in our channel about the Nintendo eShop eShop in Russia was suspended, including
1413720	1418880	the ability to patch the games and redownloading already owned content on the Sony thing, though,
1418880	1423960	the, this was, this was interesting brand Turismo seven launch was canceled.
1423960	1428640	Even people with pre-orders who were able to play immediately after launch got refunds
1428640	1430800	and the game was removed from their libraries.
1430800	1434360	So Sony is doing something, which is interesting.
1434360	1439440	Um, I, I, and I don't know if I would have heard that outside of, um, somebody over there
1439440	1441800	actually telling us, um, what's happening.
1441800	1446880	So, and, uh, I'm, I'm confident this is one of those individuals to which I earlier spoke
1446880	1452040	is informed exactly on what's going on and is not, you know, so it's, so thank you for
1452040	1455080	keeping us in the loop of, uh, from your perspective, for sure.
1455080	1456080	What's going on.
1456080	1457080	Yeah.
1457080	1462080	Uh, another comment, funnily enough today, all gaming platforms have effectively stopped
1462080	1464480	all game sales due to payment providers.
1464480	1465480	They all share.
1465480	1466720	That's probably the mastercard visa thing.
1466720	1471720	Uh, GOG had a workaround as they always supported payments using USD, but they explicitly
1471720	1473960	disabled all sales.
1473960	1479520	So, and I I'm assuming a lot of that, like you might be wondering, what are they trying
1479520	1480520	to do?
1480520	1483760	Are they trying to just make things miserable in Russia?
1483760	1485640	And part of that is, yes, they are.
1485640	1490620	Um, and it's, it's to try to, you know, because obviously we know there's a lot of disinformation
1490620	1492040	going on.
1492040	1497860	Um, which by the way, as an interesting side effect of this, I don't, has anyone else noticed?
1497860	1502220	And maybe this is, I'm fully willing to admit, maybe this is just confirmation bias and like
1502220	1507100	when you, when you want to see something, you see it, but it feels like social media
1507100	1509120	has had a lot less bullshit on it.
1509120	1511860	Like the last two weeks, I'm not saying it's bullshit free.
1511860	1516000	There's still lots of bullshit, but I feel like if you look at the replies to like a
1516000	1522220	post from a politician or a celebrity, you're not seeing the same stuff at the top.
1522220	1524220	And I think that's very interesting.
1524780	1526740	Just, just throwing it out there.
1526740	1527740	Very interesting.
1527740	1534400	Um, so, and again, I have no facts to back that up, just my personal observation, which
1534400	1538500	doesn't mean shit at the end of the day, but I have a microphone and I said, say things
1538500	1539500	into it.
1539500	1547180	Um, but anyway, the disinformation that goes on there, yes, the, the Sony, the, the MasterCard
1547180	1552700	visa sales, stop the, all this stuff is going on to try to basically alert the population.
1553700	1559500	The rest of the world, essentially, not, not completely, but a good majority of the rest
1559500	1567260	of the world is United and that Vladimir Putin, who is the leader of Russia, is the aggressor
1567260	1568260	in this circumstance.
1568260	1572700	And as the person, and as, um, you, you put it a very eloquent way, Jamie last week, and
1572700	1576620	maybe you took it from somewhere, I don't know, but you said something about like, Ukraine
1576620	1577900	cannot stop the war.
1577900	1580300	If Ukraine stops the war, they lose.
1580900	1583700	Vladimir Putin can stop the war whenever he wants.
1583700	1584700	Exactly.
1584700	1590980	If, if basically it, it was from a sign, a protest sign that if Russia stops the, stops
1590980	1595820	the war, then everything is fine.
1595820	1603420	I mean, if Ukraine stops fighting, there's no more Ukraine.
1603420	1609000	So anyhow, um, our hearts continue to go out to the Ukrainian people and, um, just so,
1609000	1614280	so many people fleeing the country and, uh, having their lives uprooted and changed.
1614280	1621280	You know, we talked last week about people, the world is a lot smaller because of podcasts,
1621280	1625400	because of streaming, because of social media, because of all these technological things
1625400	1631180	we have now, you know, there was a day and age where I couldn't get text updates from
1631180	1634620	somebody in Russia about what's going on over there.
1634620	1638040	That couldn't, you guys are kind of talking about the cold war.
1638400	1640640	That, that couldn't have happened in the eighties.
1640640	1642360	We didn't get that.
1642360	1646000	But now technology makes this world a lot smaller.
1646000	1647000	Sure does.
1647000	1648000	Yeah.
1648000	1649000	Anyway.
1649000	1650000	Yeah.
1650000	1654720	We didn't have our, you know, we barely had what the BBS is and things like that and,
1654720	1655720	you know,
1655720	1656720	um,
1656720	1664080	Misha and chat asking a question that is a little off topic, but I think is important
1664080	1665080	to address.
1665120	1669000	I am going to this, this question may be, um, difficult, but please let me get through
1669000	1670000	this.
1670000	1671000	And then I'll, I'll explain.
1671000	1676100	Uh, Misha says, so I have a legit question and this is nothing against the president
1676100	1680480	of Russia, but what would happen if you were assassinated?
1680480	1683200	Is it the same as here or is it totally different?
1683200	1687960	Again, I'm only asking, cause I don't know, um, that is a difficult question and it's
1687960	1688960	one of those.
1688960	1693800	And I want to stress that is not something I am endorsing or advocate because we had
1693800	1700520	a Senator who put his foot in his mouth as he often does, suggesting this should happen.
1700520	1702360	And this is only hypotheticals.
1702360	1703360	Yes.
1703360	1708040	I want to, I want to stress that, but I think there are a lot of people, I think we can,
1708040	1712720	who openly wonder and I don't, I don't think there's anything wrong Misha don't apologize.
1712720	1717840	You're, you're vocalizing what a lot of people are thinking, but no, they can't say the quiet
1717840	1720680	part out loud.
1720680	1721680	Nothing wrong with that.
1721680	1724560	Saying the quiet part out loud and that's fine.
1724560	1725560	What happens?
1725560	1729480	I'm going to admit, I don't know politically if it's like a succession thing, but I would
1729480	1736280	assume he is replaced with somebody who believes the same things he does.
1736280	1739720	It doesn't just magically turn around, right?
1739720	1744280	It's going to be somebody who learns from him.
1744280	1752120	There's a historical precedence of it though in, in Russia because it's basically all just
1752120	1757480	like political popularity contests after Lenin died, Stalin, no one really thought that Stalin
1757480	1762920	would be the one to take over as far as I recall, yet things in Russia, things were
1762920	1763920	okay with Lenin.
1763920	1769600	I mean, I'm not saying they were great, you know, but in relatively to Stalin, they were,
1769600	1770600	they were okay.
1770600	1773720	When Stalin came in, things really went to shit.
1773720	1781240	So they have a massive history of assassinations, corruption, of letting the people suffer on
1781240	1785200	the behalf of a chosen few.
1785200	1790200	It's really just modern.
1790200	1794520	It's just almost as bad as, as you know, what they thought they were overthrowing with SARS,
1794520	1796680	you know?
1796680	1797680	I think so.
1797680	1800160	I think the short answer to the question, because I know we want to get back into video
1800160	1807000	games, but the short answer to the question I think is whatever happens in that scenario,
1807000	1809060	it wouldn't be good.
1809060	1814660	And I think especially the way people imagine it playing out, like, you know, a mystery
1814660	1819760	person within Russia does the deed or something and that, you know what, the situation's not
1819760	1820760	going to get better.
1820760	1824800	In fact, it'll probably get worse because then there'll be a lot of finger pointing
1824800	1829700	and blaming about what foreign power was behind the whole thing.
1830240	1832820	And I think things don't get better, things get worse.
1832820	1835860	So we should actually hope that doesn't happen.
1835860	1842260	And that instead of Vladimir Putin kind of is faced with the reality that he's not going
1842260	1844740	to get what he wants in this scenario.
1844740	1852580	And in fact, the only way his people are going to get the nice things back is for this to
1852580	1853580	end.
1853580	1856500	And again, only Russia can put an end to themselves.
1856820	1862140	I think that Russia runs into a very similar problem that I think that the United States
1862140	1870540	has in the fact that it's a very large area for one government to control.
1870540	1879820	I mean, the bigger it gets, the worse off corruption becomes.
1879820	1883820	If you look at Iceland, when they had their political revolution, it was pretty easy for
1883820	1884820	them.
1884820	1885820	They were a small country.
1885820	1891740	You know, their making decisions for a smaller population was one thing.
1891740	1896280	And there's people who are talking about like full on revolution in Russia.
1896280	1901260	But they have the same problem that we would have here is that it's too big, too many people,
1901260	1903860	too many laws, too many established.
1903860	1905860	America was damaged from the conception.
1905860	1908260	I'm just going to say that right now.
1908260	1914860	Russia has kind of fallen, well, not kind of, has fallen that route for centuries.
1914900	1917900	So just saying, a little history lesson.
1917900	1925260	All right, let's go, even though the real world is important, I know this also is escapism
1925260	1926260	for some people.
1926260	1930040	So let's go back to video games and talk about our gaming week and the types of video games
1930040	1931820	that we have been playing this week.
1931820	1933060	So Dark Sakura, we'll go to you.
1933060	1935620	How was your gaming week?
1935620	1937080	Kind of busy.
1937080	1943140	So I finished Legend of Zelda Link to the Past, which was awesome.
1943140	1949900	My new retro night is started with Chrono Trigger last night, of which I am still cheating
1949900	1953020	my way through because I have beaten that game so many freaking times.
1953020	1954460	I have gotten most of the endings.
1954460	1956260	I think we have 12 of the 14.
1956260	1960920	Wait, I have to remember which one were the cartridge ones and which ones were not.
1960920	1964540	But I've got most, we've done pretty much almost all the cartridge ones between me and
1964540	1966580	Dan.
1966580	1969860	So I've been playing, so I started that.
1969860	1973340	We got to Right Before You Get Robo.
1973340	1976780	So that's pretty cool.
1976780	1982400	I've also learned that there is a particular cheat that totally makes the game break.
1982400	1984460	And it's actually kind of hilarious.
1984460	1987700	So I'm not doing that one anymore.
1987700	1993300	I love, when I had my Super Nintendo back in the day, well, I mean, I still have one,
1993300	1999820	but back then, what I used to do would be to put in just random codes and see if I could
1999820	2003840	break my games, and I did some very interesting ones.
2003840	2005460	It was pretty neat.
2005460	2009260	So I like to do the same thing now.
2009260	2014540	At any rate, though, that's the retro gaming side of it.
2014540	2018980	I didn't play Fantasian this week because I'm in that spot, and I got the same place
2018980	2027900	as a lot of RPGs where I am under-leveled for the boss fights.
2027900	2032620	And I realized that I will need another five to six levels to be effective at the boss
2032620	2033620	fights.
2033620	2038400	This is the complaint I have about Fantasian, and I'm not the only one, is that their
2038400	2045580	boss fights say, well, to do the area, it says you need to be level 43, suggested level
2045580	2047540	43, something like that.
2047540	2052680	I go in at 45 and get to the boss.
2052680	2056480	By the time I get to the boss, I'm 46, and it still hands me my ass.
2056480	2060800	And then I go look at, oh, for this guide, it's said to be 43, but I did this at level
2060800	2067680	57, and blah, blah, blah, like, okay, game, sure.
2067680	2071200	So I'm going to have to do a bunch of grinding, and I hate grinding.
2071200	2079000	I mean, I may as well just have a just chatting stream while I grind, because nothing interesting
2079000	2080000	is going to happen.
2080000	2083240	Still playing Dead by Daylight.
2083240	2084680	I got another Adept.
2084680	2086400	I got Pyramid Head.
2086400	2088720	Thank you.
2088720	2089720	You know, it's so funny.
2089720	2094000	I never played him a lot, and then I said, okay, well, I'm picking someone I have to
2094000	2098680	Adept and just playing them until I'm done with them.
2098680	2104240	And by the time I finally get the hang of Pyramid Head, I Adepted him, and I'm like,
2104240	2105240	okay, I'm done.
2105240	2113840	So now I'm moving on to Spirit, and it's embarrassing, I won't say any more.
2113880	2117760	So Spirit is my main killer, probably, more than anyone.
2117760	2122840	It's the only one I feel like I can do well with is Spirit.
2122840	2126000	I issue you a challenge then, Rob.
2126000	2128840	M1 Triss.
2128840	2129840	Take the Eerie Hatchet.
2129840	2130840	Take her two Eries.
2130840	2132840	Oh, I'm terrible with Huntress.
2132840	2134320	No, no, no, no.
2134320	2135320	Listen to me.
2135320	2137440	Listen to me.
2137440	2141640	Take the Eerie Hatchet and throw it, and then don't refill your hatchet, so you will get
2141640	2149640	like one and a half additional movement speed, and then just M1 everybody.
2149640	2150640	No one will expect it.
2150640	2151640	It's hilarious.
2151640	2157280	I saw Nick or one of the killer streamers I watched do a build like that.
2157280	2161280	It was a build for that actually might have been LC.
2161280	2163240	I did that.
2163240	2164640	So I had a challenge.
2164640	2178400	It was on one of the Tome thing where you had to hit people 10 times with just a regular
2178400	2179400	attack as Huntress.
2179400	2183840	It was called like old school or something or original or something like that.
2183840	2190360	So I did it in combination with my Adept attempt, and I got it.
2190360	2193640	And every time I have played Huntress ever since, it's been M1 Huntress.
2193640	2198520	It has been hilarious because no one expects it to try some time.
2198520	2204720	It's pretty fun, but that being said, I also got Pig to P350 finally, and I'm just saving
2204720	2210160	up all my blood points for Sadako coming out on the 8th, which also means nurse returns
2210160	2216080	on the 8th, and I'm going to try to learn nurse.
2216080	2218080	Pray for me.
2218080	2221040	I'm really excited to play the Ringu content.
2221040	2225440	I think Sadako is going to be a great killer.
2225440	2226440	And she's short, though.
2226440	2229320	I'll be happy with her because she's short.
2229320	2231420	My problem with Pyramid Head is he's tall.
2231420	2235040	Same problem I have with Plague, even though it was a plague forever.
2235040	2237560	The shorter characters, I have an easier time playing.
2237560	2239800	It just feels like a more natural line of sight.
2239800	2242160	Even Freddy is relatively short.
2242160	2244280	Just a more natural line of sight for me.
2244280	2245280	Right.
2245280	2251960	Oh, and Wordscapes, because I always freaking play Wordscapes.
2251960	2261800	Also I started playing through Dracula X Rondo of Blood, and I'm planning on doing my embarrassing
2261800	2265560	attempt at Radiant Silver Gun just randomly one day this week.
2265560	2268000	All right.
2268000	2269000	Sounds fun, Action Pat.
2269000	2270760	You've been doing a lot more streaming lately.
2270760	2273960	I think since your work schedule changed, you're streaming five days a week from now.
2273960	2276680	I see you all the time.
2276680	2283240	I try to do streams when you're not streaming, but there's no time when you're not streaming.
2283240	2288680	Well, I stream five days a week.
2288680	2289680	That's great.
2289680	2290680	That's good.
2290680	2291680	You just have to keep at it.
2291680	2292680	Awesome.
2292680	2293680	All right.
2293680	2299360	Well, that's the thing is that I'm trying to be consistent and trying to do more time.
2299360	2300760	I have a good time doing it, though.
2300760	2302400	I'm really feel like...
2302400	2303400	Good.
2303840	2304840	I'm finding my voice.
2304840	2305840	Good.
2306840	2307840	That's good.
2307840	2308840	All right.
2308840	2309840	Let's go over to...
2309840	2314840	I'll just quickly say, I see Sacred Jade in chat saying my voice audio is a bit quiet.
2314840	2315840	Sorry about that.
2315840	2319160	Again, the audio's changed a bit, trying to get used to it.
2319160	2323280	I may need to adjust my code, may not, because I can't make any further adjustments to get
2323280	2324280	me louder.
2324280	2328560	I may need to make my cohost a little softer, and I'll try that.
2328560	2330280	So we'll see how that goes.
2330280	2332880	But let me ask Loki, how was your gaming week?
2333360	2335360	It was all Minecraft again.
2335360	2336360	I know.
2336360	2337360	I think there's a problem with that.
2337360	2338360	It's a shock.
2338360	2344560	Yeah, I've been going between my new hardcore series, which I've been playing quite a bit
2344560	2348200	in, but I didn't really live stream too much.
2348200	2352520	I actually restarted from the last time I live streamed it, because before, when I live
2352520	2357040	streamed it last, I didn't have all the shaders and everything working well with it.
2357040	2358840	Plus the seed was kind of boring.
2358840	2362160	So I started a new seed, and I have all my shaders and everything.
2362160	2364760	It looks super nice now.
2364760	2367880	So I've got that going for me.
2367880	2371420	So I'm actually working on editing that first episode for that.
2371420	2377300	And then I designed a new thing for NerdCraft as well.
2377300	2383720	And so I've been gathering resources for that, which has been kind of grindy.
2383720	2384720	Lots of copper.
2384720	2387760	It takes a long time to get that and oxidize it and all that stuff.
2387760	2390000	So that's been my week mostly.
2390000	2394040	And of course, HermitCraft season nine launched today, so I've been watching their content
2394040	2395040	and everything for that.
2395040	2396040	Nice.
2396040	2399480	But yeah, that's pretty much all I've been doing.
2399480	2400480	Okay.
2400480	2401480	Let's see, my gaming week.
2401480	2403400	A little slower than my usual gaming weeks.
2403400	2407220	I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, a little killer, a little survivor,
2407220	2408800	playing that as well.
2408800	2415080	I started streaming again on my personal channel, twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, cheap plug.
2415080	2419920	But I started streaming No Man's Sky, because that fifth expedition came out the week that
2419920	2422240	I was moving and I was like, Ooh, I want to get into that.
2422240	2423240	I want to play that.
2423240	2424240	I want to stream that.
2424240	2429200	So I did start playing that on stream and I got through phase one and I only have like
2429200	2432600	one more task to do on phase two, two more tasks to do on phase two.
2432600	2436720	I'm really close to being done with one, but I'm making good progress on the expedition
2436720	2438440	and I'm enjoying that.
2438440	2440600	I just need to do some more streams with it.
2440600	2444160	I haven't played any off stream, so I need to work on that.
2444160	2445840	So I'll probably do that throughout the week next week.
2445840	2450200	I'm just not sure what days yet, because I'm, I'm prepping for a performance at the
2450200	2451940	end of the month here.
2451940	2455520	Just a local shout out, actually, I should, I should give plugs to two local shows.
2455520	2462640	So if you're based in the Sacramento area this Saturday, a really cool March 12th, John
2462640	2469080	Waters, the infamous movie director of movies like Hairspray, Serial Mom, Cry Baby, Pink
2469080	2470080	Flingos.
2470080	2471080	Cry Baby.
2471080	2477440	I'm also going to be doing a talk called Faults Negative at the Colonial Theater on March
2477440	2479560	12th, Saturday.
2479560	2485920	So I, and I am fortunate enough, I'm going to be introducing him and I'm also going to,
2485920	2492120	so after he's done, we're also having a drag invitational of some drag kings, drag queens,
2492120	2493740	non-binary royalty.
2493740	2497640	And I am hosting that as well, which is an honor to do.
2497640	2499300	So yeah, so that's exciting.
2499300	2502860	So I have that show to worry about, but then also so shout out if you're in the area, come
2502860	2503860	on out.
2503860	2510980	But on March 26th, so that's in three weeks, we're doing Clue the movie, but we're doing
2510980	2513020	it Rocky horror style.
2513020	2516540	So meaning we are performing the movie as the movie plays.
2516540	2518980	So we're performing the movie on a stage as a stage plays.
2518980	2520300	So I am in the cast.
2520300	2523540	I am playing, my role is a secret.
2523540	2526140	I am not disclosing the role that I'm playing.
2526180	2533100	So you have to come see it to find out, but it's, it's going to be hilarious.
2533100	2534560	The show is so good.
2534560	2539960	Like I died laughing today during rehearsal, I'll tell you who I'm not playing.
2539960	2544120	I'm not playing the singing telegram girl, but I know who is.
2544120	2546420	And I saw that whole scene and I died.
2546420	2547420	It was so good.
2547420	2548980	So it's, it'll be fun.
2548980	2553820	But the other, the other fun twist about Clue, we actually have Leslie Ann Warren who played
2553820	2557740	Ms. Scarlet in the movie, a last minute replacement for Carrie Fisher.
2557740	2561940	Fun fact, Carrie Fisher was supposed to be in Scarlet and dropped out to go to rehab.
2561940	2564320	And that's where, that's why we got postcards from the edge.
2564320	2568180	But anyway, Leslie Ann Warren is actually going to be there in person.
2568180	2569380	So that's really cool.
2569380	2570380	Yeah.
2570380	2571380	So.
2571380	2573380	So you're going to be playing Ms. Scarlet?
2573380	2578600	No, but, but imagine the person who's playing Ms. Scarlet, very lucky to be doing that in
2578600	2579860	front of Leslie Ann Warren.
2579860	2585500	So also, I was also not me, but I know who's doing it and she's great.
2585500	2586500	Yeah.
2586500	2587500	It's going to be great.
2587500	2588500	So gracious.
2588500	2591980	So anyway, I, I cheap plugs for those here locally, but also just like if my gaming weeks
2591980	2595420	seem a little thin, I'm trying to throw a costume together.
2595420	2596940	I'm in rehearsals.
2596940	2602820	There's a lot going on for both those shows, but it's nice to have stuff coming back again.
2602820	2605100	This is a huge year for the, in the shows department.
2605100	2608420	I just, at the end of April, see Dark Soccer, you went like this.
2609060	2612620	We're not doing any celebrities or anything super fun, but I'm going to still host it.
2612620	2618700	We're doing a goth night out where we're doing a nineties goth double feature of The Crow
2618700	2619700	and The Craft.
2619700	2620700	Double feature.
2620700	2622660	The Craft wasn't nineties though.
2622660	2623660	Yeah, it was.
2623660	2624660	98 to 99.
2624660	2626540	It was towards the end.
2626540	2627540	It was?
2627540	2628540	Yeah, it was.
2628540	2629540	Oh my God.
2629540	2630540	I thought it was like early 2000s.
2630540	2631540	So yeah.
2631540	2632540	Wow.
2632540	2633540	It was like my last year of high school.
2633540	2634540	First year of college.
2634540	2635540	Yeah.
2635540	2636540	So.
2636540	2637540	Well, I was.
2637660	2638660	That's right.
2638660	2639660	I saw it.
2639660	2645820	And I saw when I was, no, I saw it out here because I had moved out here by then.
2645820	2648660	So to be fair, they're only calling it goth night out.
2648660	2653100	I'm calling it nineties goth night out because with those movies, that's what it feels like.
2653100	2655980	Mike Deft quick on the Wiki says 96.
2655980	2656980	So yeah.
2656980	2657980	Yeah.
2657980	2658980	Then I wasn't out here then.
2658980	2660900	I saw it in Alabama.
2660900	2665060	They just teased on, I don't think I'm doing anything with this show, but because I love
2665060	2667120	SAC horror, I'll give him a shout out.
2667120	2670000	They just announced on Ash Wednesday.
2670000	2673940	They have Bruce Campbell coming in August and that'll be a really, I don't know what
2673940	2676680	they're doing with him, but he's going to be here in August.
2676680	2680020	So that's really exciting anyway.
2680020	2682860	Love horror events.com if you're willing to check that out.
2682860	2683860	Anyway.
2683860	2684860	All right.
2684860	2685860	So back to my gaming week.
2685860	2690780	I've also been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy 14, but I'm going to admit I'm kind
2690780	2693940	of, I'm kind of out of things to do in 14 right now.
2693940	2695760	I'm really waiting for that content patch.
2695760	2699820	I really enjoyed the live letter and a lot of stuff coming soon sounds, but I'm just,
2699820	2704420	I'm sick of the expert roulette and there's really nothing else for me to do in the game
2704420	2705420	regularly right now.
2705420	2709860	So I'm, I'm kind of in a waiting period on that with Final Fantasy 14.
2709860	2714460	So, and that's, that's honestly, let's see what else I feel like I went back and I played
2714460	2717380	something else on steam this week.
2717380	2721060	Oh, well I, Oh, I know what I played.
2721060	2726760	It wasn't on steam, but because I don't have a bandwidth cap anymore, you all might remember
2726760	2732300	when I switched, uh, locations, I switched internet providers and I have fiber internet
2732300	2735100	now with no bandwidth cap.
2735100	2737400	And so somebody said, Oh, rub.
2737400	2740260	So you can re download Microsoft flight simulator, right?
2740260	2742180	And I said, God damn it.
2742180	2743180	You're right.
2743180	2745460	I can re download Microsoft flight simulator.
2745460	2754940	So I played flight simulator on, on Xbox one this week after downloading 140 gigabytes,
2754940	2761240	140 gigabytes, but I don't care anymore.
2761240	2762740	So it's great.
2762740	2765920	And it is on a flight simulator is on Microsoft cloud services.
2765920	2771240	Now if you want to, you know, if 140 gigs is a lot for you, uh, the cloud might, might
2771240	2772240	be better.
2772240	2774300	Uh, tiger class says, how long did it take?
2774300	2775980	I ran it overnight.
2775980	2781700	So I don't know, because not only was I downloading that, I queued up every single update that
2781700	2787540	was overdue on Xbox series X, which was a lot because I, I, I queued up everything and
2787540	2791780	I was like, I will run this overnight and tomorrow I'll have everything updated.
2791780	2796200	And sure enough, the next day after work, everything's there ready to go.
2796200	2797200	And it was, it was lovely.
2797200	2800940	So, uh, yeah, so I've been playing Microsoft flight simulator.
2800940	2808300	And the, the first thing that I did was I crashed into my new house, except, well, except
2808300	2811800	cause you know, in flight simulator, you, you have the real world, right?
2811800	2817580	So I crashed the plane in my new house, except my new house doesn't exist in flight simulator.
2817580	2819740	It's a, it's still empty land.
2819740	2824940	All right, anyhow, uh, let's move on.
2824940	2828100	Let's get into some news, uh, that happened throughout the week.
2828260	2834420	Uh, it not a busy news week, but a few headlines here and there we're talking about, uh, Loki,
2834420	2835420	we'll start with you tonight.
2835420	2836420	Yeah.
2836420	2841780	So, um, some good news, at least it sounds like that the steam deck, if you want one
2841780	2845660	of those, and, um, that did recently come out and a lot of people really liking what
2845660	2847060	they're seeing so far.
2847060	2852300	Um, if you're interested in one and weren't able to get in on those pre-orders right away,
2852300	2856240	well, you'll be happy to know that they're ramping up their production, um, supposedly
2856240	2862720	going to hit a hundred thousands of units per month, starting, uh, with April.
2862720	2868720	Um, so that's pretty awesome that they'll be able to produce, or I'm sorry, actually
2868720	2872680	maybe not per month, but they're going to be up to hundreds of thousands of scene decks,
2872680	2875400	um, that'll been produced by April.
2875400	2880780	Um, but they're accelerating their production, which is the point in the first place.
2880780	2884560	And at least now, if you want to order it, you can, but you'll just be, you know, at
2884560	2889920	the back of the line and want the weight for it to come out, but at least it's not
2889920	2890920	hopeless.
2890920	2891920	Yeah.
2891920	2896240	I'm here sooner than other systems that are still not out yet.
2896240	2898920	I'm hearing mixed, mostly positive on steam deck.
2898920	2904040	I feel like some, some of it sounds like it's a little clunky in parts, but like when it
2904040	2908640	works, it works really well is kind of, I think a lot of it is kind of early, like some
2908640	2913960	of the software stuff still needs to be kind of updated and everything, but they're working
2913960	2918040	on dressing that stuff, but hardware wise, I think it's been pretty good.
2918040	2919040	Yeah.
2919040	2920440	I, I definitely, I'm curious about it.
2920440	2924520	I want to see, I want to play a friend's steam deck and I also kind of want to see if maybe
2924520	2930160	they end up doing a steam deck refresh in a year or so that maybe has slightly beefier
2930160	2931160	hardware.
2931160	2934280	And that might be something I'd be interested in at that time, sort of like after they get
2934280	2939000	past like, okay, this thing is a success where like, what were those computers they were
2939000	2941320	building for a while called those kind of flopped?
2941320	2947400	What were those steam hardware or something like that?
2947400	2948400	Right.
2948400	2950880	It was like the steam PC, the thing.
2950880	2951880	Yeah.
2951880	2952880	Steam PCs or something.
2952880	2953880	You remember that?
2953880	2954880	Yeah.
2954880	2955880	Steam machines.
2955880	2956880	That's it.
2956880	2957880	That's it.
2957880	2958880	I still have my steam link.
2958880	2959880	Those kinds.
2959880	2960880	Yeah.
2960880	2961880	The steam link was all right.
2961880	2966480	Like I, I found my steam controller too, while we were moving and I'd thrown it in a box at
2966480	2967480	some point anyway.
2967480	2972520	Um, but yeah, I'm, I'd be curious about the steam deck, but because it's, especially if
2972520	2976560	these things start to take off in a way that the steam machines didn't, then they probably
2976560	2978960	will refresh them, make better ones and so forth.
2978960	2981080	A little later on down the line.
2981080	2985160	It's interesting to think those steam machines, as much as I, it sounds like I'm talking shit
2985160	2986160	about them right now.
2986160	2991740	I'm not because I sort of think this is the evolution of those is they really took a look
2991740	2995840	at how do we get hardware that people want?
2995840	3000400	And I think valve looked at what Nintendo was doing and was like, Oh, we could do that.
3000400	3001580	The steam machine.
3001580	3006200	So we're more of like, it's just, this is like a PC specification that you're like,
3006200	3009400	we're going to just basically have anybody can build these.
3009400	3011000	And then we're going to throw Linux on there.
3011000	3014240	Whereas this, the steam deck is like, it's a set piece of hardware.
3014240	3017800	You know what the specs are games either run or they don't run on it.
3017800	3021880	It's not going to be like, well, it's kind of like the difference between like, you know,
3021880	3028720	games made for iOS and games made for Android, whereas iOS, you have certain phones and devices,
3028720	3032720	you know, the specs for Android is just like, it's a wild west out there.
3032720	3036480	Like there's phones all over the place and all sorts of different ranges and resolutions
3036480	3037480	and whatnot.
3037480	3041240	And so it's hard to like, be able to say, yeah, this will definitely run.
3041240	3043480	This will not run, you know, whatnot.
3043480	3046640	So I think the steam deck is definitely the step in the right direction.
3046640	3049300	If they want to do like a console version of that.
3049300	3051720	I'm all down for that as well.
3051720	3054480	I am, you know, a quick aside on the steam deck.
3054480	3058920	One thing I am hearing it does very well is emulation.
3058920	3064260	Certainly the classics you know, and again, I don't advocate piracy, however, especially
3064260	3070200	in Nintendo's case when you know, it's, it's, we know they're not very good at embracing
3070200	3071200	the old library.
3071200	3076720	I mean, we have some first party and second party stuff on the Netflix style library,
3076720	3080240	but there's certainly so many games like the guardian legend, right?
3080240	3083960	Our holy grail here at OLR, the guardian legend has never seen the light of day on virtual
3083960	3086920	console or any of that stuff because of rights issues.
3086920	3089600	So the only way to play it is to emulate it.
3089600	3093360	So it sounds like the steam deck does those very well, but it also sounds like the steam
3093360	3097840	deck is emulating like newer hardware pretty well to like, didn't they get a switch emulator
3097840	3098840	running on it?
3098840	3103800	Again, I don't advocate for piracy of stuff, especially not independent developed games
3103800	3105240	and so forth.
3105240	3110640	I, I think it's, I, I, you know, I, I'm not gonna deny that it exists and I think it's
3110640	3117760	interesting for sure because it sounds like Nintendo was like shutting down YouTube's
3117760	3123920	that were explaining how to get switch emulators on your steam deck, which I thought was very
3123920	3124920	interesting.
3124920	3129040	Um, and you know, I, I understand Nintendo trying to shut down those channels, but we
3129040	3134040	all know once on the internet, always, always on the internet and if that's why the way
3134040	3138680	back machine exists, if somebody wants to emulate a switch on the steam deck, they're
3138680	3140640	going to figure it out.
3140640	3142640	So, yep.
3142640	3148560	And Mike Deaf says, which I mean, apparently, yes, the PC is, uh, I mean, why not?
3148560	3149560	Yeah.
3149560	3154360	And again, I, I don't advocate doing that, but for retro library and game preservations
3154360	3159080	and things that Nintendo refuses to let us buy, uh, I feel a lot differently.
3159080	3165360	Um, let's see, um, interesting Rama, uh, in our chat over at twitch.tv slash log network
3165360	3170560	says, based on the success of the steam deck, I could see a newer steam machine or even
3170560	3177040	a steam tablet staying, um, that maybe they would revisit the steam machine concept.
3177040	3178760	I suppose anything's possible.
3178760	3185600	I kind of think this is it now, but who knows, uh, very interesting aha moment from fifth
3185600	3190880	dream who says ESP games can now run natively on switch, LOL.
3190880	3194800	I mean, Vita, I heard about that, that the Vita emulator now runs on switch.
3194800	3200240	Uh, I, when I first read that, my brain went to the steam deck running these games, but
3200240	3204920	isn't that also an interesting way to preserve the libraries, especially when we know Sony
3204920	3209360	wants nothing more to be than to be rid of the Vita online service.
3209360	3211120	Did they finally say they were going to shut it down?
3211120	3212120	I don't even remember.
3212280	3216840	I feel like they finally are starting to end of life it, but, um, very interesting.
3217840	3220240	Um, let's see.
3220240	3224200	There was one other thing I wanted to say, Oh, uh, before we get to the next story, a
3224200	3229640	comment on my internet, Rama said, just because you have gigabit internet, that doesn't mean
3229640	3231680	you'll always have one gig up and down.
3231920	3236520	Mine is in the 800 or excuse me, 800 to 95 megabyte at any given time.
3236720	3237280	So Ms.
3237280	3239120	Flight Sim would take less than 30 minutes.
3239360	3242240	So to answer that question, I do have gigabit internet.
3242600	3246640	Most of the speed tests are pretty reliably giving me between 900 and a thousand.
3246640	3248120	So knock on wood, it's pretty good.
3248680	3252600	Here's the fun, here's the fun thing you might not know because it's new development and
3252600	3255600	you know, we're, you know, we're pretty close to city center and all that.
3255960	3261880	Um, 2000 and 5,005 gigabit was an option.
3262400	3266600	Um, but we act, we actually said that might actually be too much.
3266800	3271800	I w and I was really trying to think, why would we need five gigabit?
3272120	3273960	And I'm not sure we need it right now.
3275000	3280200	Like my PC can't even support streaming 4k, just processing it.
3280560	3283240	I'm not sure I need the bandwidth for that right now.
3283560	3284840	Maybe in the future, who knows?
3284880	3285320	But yeah.
3285360	3291160	Uh, so that's what I, I actually do not have the best available internet here because I
3291160	3295680	said that, that, that might be a bit much, but in 10 years.
3296680	3297880	That may be what we need.
3298920	3300440	So, all right.
3300440	3302360	It's a mixed reaction from chat.
3302360	3305080	Some people saying why the hell not others saying valid.
3305120	3305840	All right, fair enough.
3306320	3310640	Um, anyway, we talked a minute ago about the Nintendo switch turning five years old,
3310640	3314360	and I'm not sure this was intentionally timed for the anniversary, but it is
3314360	3317240	interesting that, uh, this comes out just in time for that.
3317240	3321760	And that is that Nintendo switch now has missions and rewards.
3322560	3325560	And when I first heard that, I got excited because I thought that meant,
3325560	3327840	Ooh, finally achievements.
3329880	3336680	It's not really that, um, it's like, no, no, it's a little more like Microsoft's
3336680	3340840	rewards, which I've talked a little bit about on this show before, but Microsoft's
3340840	3346280	rewards is basically you get points when you use game pass, um, when you earn an
3346280	3350320	achievement, ironically enough, although that's not here, um, what does the Nintendo
3350320	3350840	thing do?
3351600	3357360	You get my Nintendo platinum points, um, by doing certain things within the Nintendo
3357360	3357840	switch.
3358000	3363440	So for example, if you play a game within the Nintendo switch online library, you get
3363440	3364440	some platinum points.
3364880	3369000	Um, you get, uh, for, for logging into the website and doing other things, you get
3369000	3369680	platinum points.
3369920	3374680	So you do these things and they've given more rewards for platinum points because it
3374680	3378520	felt like for a while there, there wasn't shit you could get with platinum points.
3378920	3383400	Um, I remember for a hot minute, there was like a Zelda P cross game you could get on
3383400	3387840	3DS and like there were some decent things you could get with platinum points, but it
3387840	3389240	hasn't been that way for a while.
3389720	3394000	Now you're going to be able to get, um, apparently physical items from the Nintendo
3394000	3399160	store, or at least they claim, I imagine you have to be fast to get those, but you can
3399160	3405560	also get digital perks like wallpapers and icon elements, but also changing your user
3405560	3411160	icon within the switch with new frames, new characters and new backgrounds.
3411480	3413160	So that's something a little bit new.
3413360	3417520	And some of you might find that silly, but at the same time, you're not really having
3417520	3419440	to do much to get these points either.
3419480	3422800	Um, you don't have to do anything like, you don't, you don't really have to spend
3422800	3427080	money unless you don't already have Nintendo switch online or something in order to do
3427080	3427360	that.
3427680	3430960	So, um, there are some rewards posted right now.
3430960	3433240	There are some various animal crossing characters.
3433280	3437600	I don't recognize any of these, but I think they are the same animal crossing characters
3437600	3439280	that have March birthdays.
3440000	3441480	So that's, that's the tie in.
3441720	3444400	And then it looks like some super Mario Odyssey icons.
3444440	3447000	Like I see, um, uh, captain toad in there.
3447000	3452000	I see some of the various, uh, like, um, the cheap, cheap wearing the Mario hat and
3452000	3452600	things like that.
3452800	3456400	There's some just unique icons you can get with those, which is all right.
3457000	3462600	You, I guess, but probably nothing anyone's going to drop everything and go for, but
3462600	3465240	you know, if they get up the quality of some of these rewards, that could be very
3465240	3465680	interesting.
3465680	3472240	I think, um, I just, man, I felt like we were getting so close to achievements, which
3472240	3472760	would be fun.
3472800	3475600	I just, and I talked about this on last week's show.
3475600	3480360	I hate saying this time blue in the face, but it would just be so cool if we could
3480360	3485960	have like a digital trophy shelf to really show that I beat kid Icarus without using a
3485960	3486440	code.
3486920	3491000	That's a bit, that should be, that should be recognized as the big fucking deal that
3491000	3491520	it is.
3492200	3493960	Yeah, that game ain't easy.
3494280	3494920	Exactly.
3494960	3496280	So I think it'd be nice.
3496680	3502280	Uh, E3VL says, log in a week, once a week for 30 points, mobile games for platinum
3502280	3502640	points.
3502680	3504880	Oh, I think that was a thing for a hot minute too.
3505160	3509160	You could get some rewards and like the animal crossing game and the Mario cart game
3509160	3510240	with your platinum points.
3510320	3514280	So that's, um, that's another thing you can, um, I think, I think is still available.
3514760	3518080	So, yeah, I think that's still about, I haven't checked in a while.
3518400	3521480	Yeah, I've, it's been a while since I played any of the Nintendo mobile titles.
3522400	3522760	All right.
3522760	3524480	Uh, moving on dark soccer.
3524480	3525120	What do you have for us?
3526280	3527480	I have a thing.
3527520	3535040	Well, and as we, uh, teased at the end of Bobby's show, um, uh, Epic games has made an
3535040	3538520	acquisition and we know that Epic games is a video game company.
3538520	3540840	They've got their store, they did Fortnite.
3541240	3548960	Um, but they acquired band camp, which when I first saw that, I just went, I burped a
3549200	3549680	little bit.
3550480	3555920	Um, but they announced that they were quote joining Epic games.
3555960	3562360	So there's nothing about like an actual, how much they paid, what the details are, but
3563360	3567000	they say that band camp's going to keep operating the way that it did.
3567480	3573960	Um, um, but that they turned down previous, uh, corporate attempts, but believe that
3573960	3576200	Epic is aligned with their vision and values.
3576960	3580840	Um, so it is what it is.
3580840	3589120	So, um, hopefully it will, it won't affect, you know, band camp continuing with the way
3589120	3593520	that they are, but at the same time, I'm a little bit iffy.
3593720	3598600	I just, there's things Epic does that just make me unhappy.
3599240	3603080	But now the good thing about band camp though, is that like I've been introduced to so many
3603080	3603640	good artists.
3603640	3605560	Like that's how I learned about Mystery Skulls.
3606680	3615520	Um, and it was actually, I had seen that whole video that was a parody of, uh, Phoenix
3615520	3619240	Wright, the, the turntable turnabout.
3620680	3626400	And that had me looking for that song, which led me to finding, uh, the band camp site,
3626640	3629440	uh, their, their album on band camp, which, which I bought.
3630000	3632320	Um, I found a lot of good artists that way.
3632480	3638440	So, uh, hopefully they'll still continue to be able to give people the exposure, especially
3638440	3639400	for people just starting out.
3639400	3643640	So, um, I, I don't know, it's, it's weird.
3643640	3646160	I understand why indie artists have reservations.
3646160	3646920	Absolutely.
3646920	3647560	And you're right.
3647560	3652040	Epic does have a strange track record, um, especially, you know, the guy running it writes
3652040	3657960	a lot of dumb shit on Twitter and, you know, picks fights, uh, try trying to be a, um, a
3657960	3661840	martyr when, you know, he has problems in his own backyard.
3661840	3664480	But anyway, I digress, but I see why people have problems with it.
3665440	3670360	Um, I could see, you know, and a lot of people are thinking, Oh, this is like a Fortnite
3670360	3670760	thing.
3671080	3674680	And, you know, no, they're insisting, like, they're not changing band camp or anything
3674680	3680680	like that, but it could be interesting, especially, you know, if, if, if Fortnite really is more
3680680	3684480	than just a shooter game, which is what the creators of Fortnite wants you to believe.
3684840	3689800	And if trying to try to show in interesting cases, like we talked many months ago on the
3689800	3691560	show about the Ariana Grande concert.
3691560	3695000	And that was the first thing that happened in Fortnite in a long time that really made me
3695000	3699640	look and go the fuck, but like in a good way, because it was something where it was like,
3699640	3702760	okay, Fortnite is being used for something that I don't associate with Fortnite.
3703000	3705000	And that was like an interactive music video type of thing.
3705440	3706680	So my point is.
3707160	3708960	That thing isn't exactly unprecedented.
3709320	3709560	Yeah.
3709560	3717560	But if, if Epic is trying to leverage band camp or indie artists exposure to tie together
3717560	3724280	Fortnite into some type of pop culture universe soundtrack made by indie artists, I could see
3724280	3729200	that there may be some exciting prospects there, but I also completely understand and respect that
3729200	3732920	there are some indie artists that want fucking nothing to do with Fortnite and don't want
3732920	3733880	anything to change.
3733920	3736480	And I think it's important to keep them happy or guess what?
3736480	3739320	They'll just form a new site like band camp.
3740080	3742880	It should be just, there should be options for it.
3743160	3747080	There's nothing stopping the indie artists from leaving at any time and going to a new
3747080	3747560	place.
3747680	3748400	That's the thing.
3748440	3749720	Epic didn't buy the music.
3750240	3751240	Epic bought band camp.
3753520	3757840	Some interesting perspectives in chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network, because we are where
3757840	3760160	every gamer has a voice and some voices on this.
3760160	3766040	Rama says, I did hear that Tencent pushed Epic's hand because Tencent already has investments in
3766040	3768320	Spotify and other music services.
3768320	3770560	If I recall correctly, it feels like Tencent.
3771560	3774040	That actually has been mentioned about it too.
3774600	3782400	But I mean, there's also the mention though, that since Epic acquired, uh, harmonics that maybe
3782400	3783800	they already had the interest in music.
3785560	3785960	Uh, S.
3785960	3790560	Joe and Hunter Matt says, uh, well, a wait and see, but I totally get the indie artist whose
3790560	3795120	livelihood is tied to this system that is now going to be in bed with Tencent as well.
3795160	3795440	Yeah.
3795480	3797600	I understand the reservations for sure.
3797640	3798120	For sure.
3798520	3802800	So we'll just have to see what develops and, um, what Epic does with this.
3804040	3805040	Moving on Loki.
3806400	3806600	Yeah.
3806600	3807960	So this is pretty cool news.
3807960	3815560	So we've got John Romero, the co-creator of the doom franchise, and he is releasing a brand new
3815560	3817480	level for doom too.
3817960	3820960	He's like charging a five year old for it.
3821000	3827960	And, um, if you, uh, make that donation, you can get the wonderful level and a hundred percent of the
3827960	3834320	proceeds go towards, uh, the red cross and UN central emergency response funds.
3835200	3842200	So for a good cause, and you get to play some new doom, considering that he hasn't made a level for
3842200	3845800	doom or at least doom too, since I think the game came out.
3847120	3852520	I heard some of the personal effects with this are very nice as well, that he actually has like the
3852520	3857320	community created identification files in there and that he filled them out.
3857320	3862720	Just like any other like fan content creator would, and that, I guess there's a section that
3862720	3866000	refers to what other wads did this creator make?
3866040	3868480	Cause, uh, WAD is the type of like doom.
3868480	3868840	Yeah.
3869160	3872360	And he just put doom dot wad, doom two dot wad.
3874640	3875760	And I thought that was funny.
3875880	3878000	Like it's the little effects like that, that made this cute.
3878120	3884920	But I also love the fact that, you know, like, This is a really creative way to like raise money for a
3884920	3891560	cause like this is, this is somebody coming back from, you know, the class, the archives really to get
3891560	3892440	back on the horse.
3892440	3896560	And, and I don't know if this was new or maybe something that was unfinished before.
3896920	3901040	Um, but I think this is really cool and definitely, you know, something that, um, is worthy of, of
3901040	3902040	tossing some point at.
3902080	3904200	So, um, yeah, pretty cool.
3904440	3904600	Yeah.
3904600	3911400	I wonder what other classic, uh, game developers, you think we could get David Crane to make a pitfall three.
3912920	3913440	Who knows?
3914080	3914480	Who knows?
3914480	3915520	Maybe a pinball table.
3915520	3915680	No.
3915680	3915880	Okay.
3915880	3924400	I don't, I don't, I don't want to make light of a, what is a serious fundraising effort, but I just think it's a, it's a really cool, uh, like innovative way to do some fundraising.
3924400	3925000	And I hope it's really.
3926760	3928400	All right, moving on.
3928440	3943880	I also hope this is successful because let me tell you, as much as I enjoy Microsoft flight simulator on Xbox series X, it is painfully obvious that it is just a port of a PC game running on the series X up to the point that when you first launched a game,
3943960	3950360	you see a computer mouse in the upper left-hand corner of the screen that you can't use or touch or do anything with.
3950360	3951600	It's kind of humorous to me.
3951960	3956200	Um, it's interesting that Legend of Zaku says you need to use a flight stick.
3956240	3956720	I do.
3956960	3961080	I'm not buying a flight stick may well, never say never.
3961280	3963480	I'm not interested in one yet, but I will say.
3964440	3966680	Flight simulator is like, it's a beautiful game.
3967000	3976520	It is just, it's a beautiful, chill game, very relaxing, very relaxing to just, you know, chill out and play flight simulator.
3976760	3977360	It's great.
3977800	3986040	So, um, anyway, uh, looking at, uh, the next story, which talks about keyboard and mouse support potentially coming to Xbox cloud gaming.
3986680	3997920	Um, and actually they're talking about flight simulator in this, uh, report too, is that, uh, you can't use a keyboard and mouse on the Xbox one version.
3998160	4007520	But according to the, uh, head of the team that made flight simulator, Jorg Newman, uh, there was a Q and a, uh, that was done.
4007520	4011280	And, uh, Jorg Newman said Microsoft is working on adding.
4012000	4014920	Platform level support for keyboard and mouse.
4015160	4018400	And most games on Xbox cloud gaming could include this method.
4018600	4019400	The quote is.
4019880	4021840	So the platform team is working on this.
4022080	4024640	I know I can't give a date because it's the platform team.
4024920	4026560	I don't know their dates, but it's coming.
4026880	4032920	I'm hoping it will be done by June or so, but I can't ever tell that seems kind of new.
4033360	4043760	Uh, so the verge, uh, saw this interview and asked Microsoft to make an official comment, which a spokesperson said, quote at launch Microsoft fight simulator.
4044160	4049320	I say fight simulator, Microsoft flight simulator supports standard controller inputs for cloud gaming.
4049640	4055400	The team is experimenting with touch gyro and is excited to embrace mouse and keyboard.
4055520	4060800	Once it's available on the platform, we have no specific announcements or timing to share at this time.
4061200	4064960	Um, some other things that could really benefit from mouse and keyboard support.
4065360	4071200	PC and Mac players could play halo infinite with their keyboard and mouse on the cloud.
4071560	4078600	Cause even if you're playing halo infinite today on a PC on the cloud, if you're playing it, not on the cloud, you can use the word mouse.
4078600	4079840	We've played the cloud version.
4080560	4085720	You have to use a controller because the cloud is all powered with Xbox series X.
4086040	4088160	So that could be very interesting.
4088320	4091280	Um, and, uh, yeah, I'm all for it.
4091520	4098280	I think, uh, there are some games I enjoy with, uh, a controller, but there's a lot I enjoy with keyboard and mouse as well.
4098600	4098840	Sure.
4100040	4105200	Doc was trying to win me over in chat saying it's not that expensive for Microsoft flight simulator.
4105560	4106160	We'll see.
4106160	4106600	We'll see.
4106600	4107400	We'll see someday.
4107600	4109960	Rob, what thrift?
4110960	4112200	Oh, maybe I'll keep an eye out for you.
4112360	4113720	Maybe that's not a bad idea.
4113800	4114200	We'll see.
4114240	4116480	I find flight sticks all the time at thrift stores.
4116480	4117440	So I'll keep my eyes open.
4117920	4118680	All right, moving on.
4119000	4120280	We may have one I could lend you.
4120280	4120760	I don't know.
4121280	4124560	What do you have for us?
4126000	4133160	So there is, it's right now still a bit of a rumor, but, um, Oh my goodness.
4134080	4140320	So Star Wars Eclipse, the game that was to be developed by Quantic Dream, uh, may actually be canceled.
4141280	4147640	Um, they were basically, they put out that, like that really pretty trailer and everyone was excited about it.
4147720	4155600	But, um, it was supposed to be released in 2024, but they're saying it can be pushed back to 2027 or 2028.
4156480	4162520	Uh, Quantic Dream, uh, well, first of all, we know that they've had some problems with their toxic work culture.
4163280	4175440	Um, but they were basically saying that with that trailer, the purpose of it was to, of course, attack, attract a talent to, to help work on the game, but it didn't have the desired effect.
4176040	4178000	Uh, no one would step up and work on it.
4178960	4182080	Um, the staffing issues are really, really the, the issue.
4182640	4189920	Um, the, the site actually is quoted as saying, staffing issues are pushing the release of the game far, far away.
4189920	4194400	As a result, Star Wars Eclipse is likely to be released around 2027 to 2028.
4195240	4203800	And on top of that, Quantic Dream has been really pushing to get more job openings, but they're going unfilled.
4203800	4214400	Um, they have, they update their dates for the same job openings and, uh, and now it's also rumored that they're trying to shop themselves out for acquisition.
4215200	4222880	So, um, oh, and the other thing too, is that they're saying that there's some problems with the, with the QD game engine, which they would be using for Star Wars Eclipse.
4222880	4225640	So any number of reasons.
4225640	4229800	So I'll believe it when I see it.
4229800	4238320	I really, you know, I like the games that they've made, even if I don't enjoy the, you know, what the, excuse me, what the company has done.
4239440	4247480	I would like to hope that maybe bringing in new talent and new blood, if they could get the people would change their, the culture there.
4248840	4252160	But that's, seems like it's going to be a bit of a pipe dream.
4252200	4253320	So we'll see what happens.
4253680	4259120	Yeah, that would just surprise me because they, I feel like they just announced that game and then for it to disappear.
4259120	4266680	But I mean, everything you're saying logically makes sense that when has that not happened before though, that trailer was supposed to drum up interest.
4266720	4269800	That's not happening because of all this other bullshit going on.
4269800	4272280	So like, I would have played the crap out of that.
4272360	4272800	Yeah.
4273280	4273560	Yeah.
4273800	4283280	It is interesting though, the idea that they could get acquired, um, and that may be their way, you know, I mean, look at how Activision's getting out of this mess and how we're finally getting rid of Bobby Kotick.
4283560	4295160	You know, it's going to take two years in Microsoft, but, and maybe that's what happens ultimately with Quantic Dream is, and I can, I could see Sony being a huge partner for them, especially after things like Detroit and so forth.
4295200	4299080	Um, they make beautiful games is the thing.
4299680	4313280	Um, it's just, it would be my hope that they would be able to change themselves enough and prove that they've changed so that they can attract the right kind of people.
4313320	4324520	The right kind of talent back to the company and, and really put out another, another masterpiece, but we'll see.
4326200	4326720	All right.
4326720	4328120	Going back to Loki.
4329600	4330120	All right.
4330120	4334320	So we've got an acquisition by Netflix games.
4334320	4345200	Uh, purchase the developer next games, who is a mobile game developer who has worked on titles like the walking dead, our world, the walking dead, no man's land.
4345240	4357960	And of course also producing stranger things, puzzle tales, uh, which I think, I think that might be on their service that like a Netflix game service or whatever that they have, uh, with the mobile games.
4358280	4371280	I think it might be on there, but, um, basically saying that we're excited for next games to join Netflix as a core studio in the strategic region and key talent market expanding our internal game studio capabilities.
4371920	4380320	While we're just starting in games, I'm confident that together next games, we'll be able to build a portfolio of world-class games that will delight our members around the world.
4382280	4383600	Okay, cool.
4383640	4384600	Hope that happens.
4384680	4391200	Um, so far, I haven't been impressed with anything that Netflix games has had, but I mean, that can turn around.
4391200	4396640	Obviously they're, you know, they're doing a lot of stuff in the whole, um, you know, movie and TV space.
4396640	4397240	So why not?
4398000	4401040	It just takes the right game to really get them going, right?
4401080	4408440	You know, a lot of people were ready to write off Amazon games because it felt like, you know, that first game, I don't even remember where that first game was.
4408440	4409920	They launched that flopped.
4410320	4412680	Um, and then a new world was taken forever.
4412680	4418320	But when it launched new world was kind of the talk of the town for about two weeks, and now it's really died out.
4418640	4419040	Thank you.
4419040	4420760	Crucible since questmaster, that was it.
4421080	4424240	Uh, and now lost arc is doing very well for them.
4424240	4427840	So, um, you know, it just takes the right game.
4428480	4431040	Really get you going and get the buzz going about you.
4432840	4434520	Yeah, we'll see.
4435360	4440760	Um, let's move on to a story, uh, about a game that's been updated and I think this is pretty neat.
4440800	4449960	Um, it's game called the Haven, which I remember I actually played this because it was on Xbox game pass, but they removed it just in time for this to come out.
4449960	4450760	But I think this is neat.
4451080	4463240	Um, it, and the whole thing is like a love story is really what it's about because our relationships based story, uh, between two characters, you and Kay, and they're on a alien world.
4463240	4465720	And they do, they do the part of it.
4466320	4469080	Part of it felt like a little bit like flower to me.
4469120	4475200	Like, I know that seems weird, but the main mechanic of the game kind of, it was like flower a little bit to me, but you're kind of like dashing through landscapes and doing things.
4475200	4488000	But anyway, um, and, uh, pretty much the way this game has existed for the last, I think about two years that it's been out, uh, you and Kay have been a male female couple.
4488960	4493240	Well, a major update just came out and you can change the genders of the couple.
4493720	4500120	So now you can play the game if you want as the way it was before a woman and a man, or you can play two women.
4500640	4501720	Or you can play two men.
4502400	4505040	Um, and this isn't just like a re skinning.
4505560	4508760	Uh, they actually went in and, and made this work.
4509040	4518120	Uh, the characters have been essentially redesigned, but like they still retain elements of like the characters from before.
4518440	4521120	Uh, so they, they, they just, it's, it's interesting.
4521480	4530360	Um, and, uh, let's see, there are three D renders now of both characters, two D assets for the characters, new voices.
4530400	4537720	So Lexi and Kendrick and Ryan highly voice the new characters, because obviously now there's a new male character and a new female character.
4537880	4539320	So they have new voices with that.
4539320	4540000	So that's interesting.
4540280	4543760	They still have the same personality, the same backstory, the same life.
4544080	4552080	Uh, they say for technical reasons, it's the same body size, hairstyle and body shape, but I don't think that really matters at the end of the day.
4552480	4559040	Um, so, and they also redid the written dialogue in all eight languages that Haven is available in.
4559400	4568400	And any line that has explicit or implicit gender references, they've been modified to work with, um, the new like gender roles.
4568440	4571000	So like if you called K Mr.
4571240	4573280	Uh, that doesn't work so much anymore.
4573280	4574240	So they modified it.
4574600	4585080	So it's interesting because they say originally the game was going to have eight couples to explore a diverse range of relationships, but that was scaled back.
4585200	4589880	But this couples update has allowed them to go back and explore some of those ideas.
4590360	4595200	So that's, that's a very comprehensive update for a game that's been out for a little bit.
4595440	4601040	And certainly for many people, I think it's going to have them give a second look to a game that they may have skipped before.
4601200	4602160	So I think that's pretty.
4603400	4604960	All right, well, let's go back.
4604960	4609640	Let's go back to a time when, uh, you could not edit a game.
4610120	4613360	You, you just, you had the game you had and that's it.
4613400	4615520	You couldn't, you couldn't go back and do updates to it.
4615560	4617080	Let's, let's roll the bumper.
4625200	4635080	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4635520	4638280	It's time for classic game of the week.
4639200	4642880	But once a month, dark Sakura mixes it up a little bit.
4643280	4644840	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us tonight?
4646080	4655160	I have the, um, well, it's the handheld of the week and this one is, um, um, uh, I
4655200	4660680	have no comment it's the game com or game.com as, as it's written.
4660760	4664480	It's, it's, uh, why did I pick this anyway?
4665520	4670720	Um, it is a fifth generation handheld console by tiger electronics, but I am
4670720	4674480	considering this just in general, one of those handheld electronics.
4674480	4675880	Cause really, have you seen one?
4676880	4682880	Um, they had, uh, it was released, um, on September 12th, 1997.
4682920	4685320	I think we still have one somewhere?
4685440	4686160	Question mark.
4686640	4691320	Um, there's also a smaller version in mid 1999 called the game.com pocket pro.
4692080	4696480	And, uh, it had internet because of the.com.
4696760	4697640	It had to have internet.
4697760	4701480	It was a 14.4 kilobit, uh, per second.
4703280	4705160	It's.com.
4706160	4714920	It sold fewer than 300,000 units and was discontinued in 2000 because of poor sales.
4716800	4717240	Yes.
4717640	4726120	Anyway, the, the, uh, it was, uh, it had brought out this thing called the
4726120	4732280	R zone console in 1995 to compete with the virtual boy, but it was also a flop.
4732320	4736560	Um, they also had like the different LCD, of course, games and everything.
4736560	4739160	And this is just really more of a cartridge based extension of the
4739160	4741040	little tiger electronic handheld games.
4741920	4747000	Um, so they, uh, surprised anyone would want to compete with the virtual boy.
4749720	4755520	Less headaches, maybe, but anyway, um, they, uh, they wanted this to come out
4755520	4760040	as a direct competitor to the game boy, and they were stated as saying that
4760680	4764600	this would quote, change the gaming world as we know it, and that it
4764600	4766280	would be one of the summer's hits.
4767120	4773120	Um, it was the only new game console of the year at, uh, E3 1997.
4773640	4778520	They expected it to start selling in July and, uh, they were saying
4778520	4781480	that it was interesting and called it a game boy for adults.
4782720	4787960	So it sold for 69.95, had an internet access cartridge,
4788040	4789760	uh, for release in October.
4790280	4794760	The game included with it was Lights Out and Solitaire was built into the console.
4795760	4799920	Um, it was marked as Tiger's largest project launch ever.
4800320	4804280	They had a website at the domain game.com.
4804840	4806920	They marketed TV.
4806920	4809240	They just had all kinds of business.
4809280	4813720	It was released in the UK for, uh, uh, 79.99.
4814920	4818080	Um, it was black and black and white.
4818760	4824320	Um, basically just, uh, it had a very similar design to, uh, the game gear,
4824360	4827320	but a lot more rectangular, not so sleek.
4828040	4831440	Um, it had a larger screen than the game boy and had higher resolution.
4831840	4834800	It included a phone directory, a calculator, and a calendar,
4835320	4838520	um, and had some PDA features.
4838680	4841440	So, uh, you know, it was supposed to be kind of cool.
4841440	4845320	You know, it was, uh, supposed to be simple, cheap.
4845680	4847560	It was powered by four AA batteries.
4847560	4849240	You had an AC adapter available.
4850000	4856280	Um, you also had, uh, what was called the complete.com serial cable.
4856680	4859800	So you could connect your consoles, uh, to play multiplayer games.
4860320	4862840	Uh, there were, uh, two game cartridge slots.
4862880	4866160	I thought that, that honestly, I thought that was pretty cool so that you wouldn't
4866160	4869560	need to switch out your, your cartridge, but it would allow you to put in like the
4869560	4872440	internet cartridge and another game so you could play it online.
4873160	4877120	Um, it was one of the first, actually it was the first gaming
4877120	4878840	console to feature a touch screen.
4879880	4884680	And, uh, it was also the first handheld console to have internet connectivity.
4885280	4892440	Um, the monochrome touch screen was, uh, let's see, measures, uh, one and a half
4892440	4898120	inches by two inches and had a square zones imprinted onto the screen to let
4898160	4901200	the players determine where they were going to apply their stylus.
4901200	4904840	Um, it, it, uh, the touch screen did not have a backlight.
4905560	4911640	Um, it, it also was the first internal, uh, sorry, first, uh, handheld system
4911640	4915760	to have internal memory, which is used to save high scores and contact information.
4916400	4921840	Um, they then released a smaller version called, uh, the game.com pocket pro.
4922680	4927240	Um, and it was also shown at E3, uh, May, 1999.
4927400	4930520	It was released in June, 1999 for $29.99.
4930840	4933520	Had five different colors because of course it did.
4933560	4936560	I mean, everyone had to, had to make after Apple that year.
4937280	4940840	Um, it actually was completely without color.
4941240	4944360	Um, it was designed to be the size of a Game Boy Pocket.
4945160	4948360	Um, different, you know, screen size.
4948360	4950040	It only had one cartridge slot.
4950080	4952960	Um, it required two double A batteries.
4953000	4955040	It included the directory, a calendar, a calculator,
4955040	4956520	but lacked internet capability.
4956520	4960400	Um, and it was meant to compete with Game Boy Color, but it didn't have color.
4961080	4966760	So, um, going back to those internet features though, um, it had a cartridge,
4966800	4971640	um, it required a cartridge and a dial-up modem, neither came with the system.
4972200	4977280	You could read email, it could, it could be read and sent on the
4977280	4978920	gameboy.com using that cartridge.
4979440	4984120	Um, it supported text only web browsing through, uh, the internet service
4984120	4988920	providers, um, you could not save your email though, to the internal memory.
4989480	4995880	Um, and, uh, you had to use the internet surface, uh, service through Delphi that
4995880	5001040	was made specifically to work on the game.com, um, the web link cartridge
5001040	5006280	came out that allowed players to connect to their, uh, computer and using that
5006280	5009640	cartridge, they could upload their high scores to the game.com website,
5009640	5011800	uh, to be, uh, listed on webpage.
5012440	5017000	And, uh, none of those games, even though they had the internet, the
5017000	5020240	cartridge that you could use at the same time, none of those supported any kind
5020240	5021880	of internet features with the games.
5021880	5023440	So when they came out.
5023840	5030880	So overall, um, uh, the audio for it was, uh, was mono, um, two 4-bit waveform
5030880	5034680	generators, uh, with their own frequency, volume control and waveform data,
5035440	5038880	and noise generator and one direct 8-bit PCM output channel.
5039640	5042880	Um, a handful of games came out for it.
5042880	5048640	It had a really, really light, uh, light, uh, library.
5048640	5049440	That's what I'm thinking of.
5050040	5055600	Um, it, they plan to have like a dozen games available when it came out, but,
5055600	5059280	uh, yeah, they, uh, that didn't happen.
5059280	5065880	Um, so the games themselves, um, were on 16 megabit cartridges.
5066480	5070280	Um, they were ranged between $19 and $29.
5070320	5073880	Um, the games that came out, there were the, there are 20 games.
5073880	5077920	Most of them developed, uh, internally by Tiger, apart from Solitaire.
5077960	5079920	Well, actually Solitaire is included.
5079920	5083760	There was Solitaire, Batman and Robin, Centipede, Duke Nukem 3D, Fighters,
5084760	5090320	Megamix, Frogger, Henry, Indy 500, Jeopardy, Lights Out, which was the pack-in,
5090760	5094960	uh, Lost World, Jurassic Park, Monopoly, Mortal Kombat trilogy, Quiz Whiz,
5094960	5100640	Cyber Trivia, Resident Evil 2, um, which I know is one of the ones I had, Scrabble,
5100840	5104880	Sonic Jam, Tiger Casino, Wheel of Fortune, Wheel of Fortune 2, and Williams Arcade
5104880	5105480	Classics.
5106120	5109840	Um, they were supposed to have a version of Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
5110160	5118080	Um, like a Furby game, Metal Gear Solid, um, Sonic 3D Blast, uh, a WCW game,
5118120	5119360	Truck Dinosaur Hunter.
5119360	5123120	There, there are some titles that were planned for it, but yeah.
5123520	5124440	Let's be real.
5124480	5128880	Thank God we never saw the horror of Symphony of the Night on this pizza
5128880	5129480	garbage.
5129480	5133520	Like looking at Resident Evil 2, which is what we're looking at as the, um, we're
5133520	5134600	broadcasting live on Twitch.
5134600	5136000	Like, I'm sorry, this was like garbage.
5136000	5137280	Like it's two frames a second.
5137640	5138320	Mission chat.
5138480	5140600	It looks like a CDI game, honestly.
5140600	5142160	Like it looks like a CDI Zelda game.
5143120	5145160	It's, it's not, that's not a compliment.
5145200	5148080	This, this is exactly what it played like.
5148560	5152960	Um, but at any rate, like it had such negative reviews about it.
5153000	5158160	Um, although the Wisconsin State Journal said that there was some serious
5158160	5163320	advantages over the Game Boy, including the touch screen, but, um, the, the
5163320	5166800	processor was only, gave it marginal improvements to the Game Boy.
5166800	5170880	And the thing is, is that Tiger, apparently from the looks of it, didn't
5170880	5176520	know their system to program it as well as Nintendo did, or else they would have
5176520	5178240	been able to work around those limitations.
5178920	5184960	Um, it does have a, uh, a lasting legacy though of, uh, of having been
5184960	5187240	a system that really, really tried.
5187880	5191840	There was apparently really good audio that came out of those speakers.
5192320	5198400	Um, the PDA functionality for when it came out was a big factor for it, sort
5198400	5205080	of gave it that, uh, adult, you know, appeal, but it had some of the most
5205080	5209640	disappointing games that were made even worse by the outdated screen.
5209640	5210520	And that is a quote.
5211160	5219640	Um, so yeah, this basically is, uh, it's been listed as one of the worst
5219680	5224320	consoles of all time, especially because of the low screen quality
5224680	5228560	and it's a very, uh, thin library.
5229080	5234000	Um, Nadia Oxford of US gamers, uh, said it died in record time because
5234000	5235760	it was poorly made to say the least.
5236960	5240040	So a legacy of failure, game.com.
5241920	5243560	Print that on the back of the box.
5243560	5250400	Um, I, when you, when you say you tried is kind of the takeaway from this.
5250440	5251000	I laughed.
5251000	5251440	You didn't.
5252760	5253760	Oh, I'm just laughing.
5253760	5256760	Cause I just see that gold star where it's written in comic sans.
5256760	5257360	You tried.
5258120	5262640	Oh, this, the star is lopsided and tigers would be the lopsided one.
5262640	5263240	This is fuck you.
5263240	5263680	I tried.
5264000	5264600	Or fuck you.
5264600	5265320	I did a good job.
5265760	5271800	And everyone else would just be shaking their head and say, Oh honey, no.
5272840	5273520	All right.
5273920	5277640	Everyone else would just give it like this, like puce colored star that just
5277640	5285800	says, no, the classic handheld of the month, uh, the game.com not, not
5285800	5287840	everything, not everything as a highlight.
5289200	5293200	So sometimes this isn't even a low light low light at least makes hair look pretty.
5293240	5296040	This isn't even that sometimes.
5296640	5299080	Sometimes backlight is like a flat shaded mid tone.
5299880	5302640	Sometimes we have to look back at our mistakes.
5303560	5308960	Anyway, uh, the classic handheld of the month, uh, once a month dark
5308960	5314120	soccer in the year 2022 is picking a classic or at least notable, maybe
5314120	5318360	as a better word handheld, I don't even know if this was notable to be honest.
5318360	5319960	It, it did.
5320240	5324960	It, it did garner attention because again, it was the first touch screen
5324960	5327360	on a handheld first internal memory.
5327800	5332200	It had some ambitious capabilities to it, but it's too bad.
5332200	5337160	The rest of it flopped, but if they had put time into a better screen on this
5337160	5343280	thing and up to the price point by like 10 bucks, that would have been a lot better.
5343280	5348320	I mean, bump the processor a bit, put a better screen and it could have,
5348400	5351480	it could have been something, it could have been a contender.
5352080	5355000	If they upgraded it to the point where it wasn't the thing that
5355000	5356800	it was, it would have been great.
5356840	5363480	But, but you do say what I mean though, about, you know, the touch screen
5363760	5367440	and that touch screen, we eventually got them in our handheld consoles.
5367480	5371040	Our phones are, you know, that I try to look for my phone when
5371040	5372000	I'm using it as my webcam.
5372520	5375520	Um, but we had that capability there.
5375520	5381760	I mean, this was one of the things that paved the way for what we expect out of,
5381880	5386480	you know, some of our modern handheld consoles and our phones and, and the
5386480	5390600	like, the internal memory was a big thing, having it act as a PDA was a big thing.
5390600	5394880	It was just like, what was, what were the PDAs at the time?
5394880	5395680	Not the Blackberry.
5395680	5397120	This was before Blackberry, I think.
5397720	5398280	A beeper?
5398320	5399800	Like, hmm?
5400080	5400840	A beeper?
5401720	5402600	No, no, no, no.
5402600	5404640	It was like the big silver ones that-
5404640	5405840	Palm Pilot says-
5406120	5407160	Palm Pilot, yeah.
5407880	5412440	It was, it was like, it was, I think it was trying to do too much.
5413760	5414360	Perhaps.
5414360	5419080	If it, if that capability had been sent into the games and the display
5419080	5420520	instead of all that other business.
5422200	5427440	I think it also stands as a symbol of that era where everything was dot com.
5427600	5430840	You just, you just have to put the internet in everything and it's, and
5430920	5434800	honestly, cause we know, I mean, not every, not everybody knows because
5435200	5436880	some of you weren't born yet.
5438080	5443960	I was at the grocery store yesterday, somebody behind me buying liquor and
5443960	5445720	the cashier says, when were you born?
5446040	5447960	The person says 1997.
5448160	5451520	And I'm like, ah, I'm so upset right now.
5452480	5456640	Anyway, I'm just saying, you all will feel it too someday.
5456640	5460200	If you're sitting there going, I was born in 97, you'll, you will understand
5460200	5463000	my pain someday, someday, bitch, someday.
5463040	5465200	By the way, Bobby would be proud of me.
5466160	5471120	Normally when I go to Daiso, they're playing like K-pop, they were actually
5471120	5475560	playing like seventies and eighties rock.
5475680	5477840	And one person's like, Oh my God, what's this?
5477840	5479880	I'm like, don't you dare say anything bad about Rush.
5479880	5480680	I will end you.
5482360	5488800	And they looked over at me and like, and then I hear from another aisle.
5488920	5490120	Yeah.
5492880	5494320	That happened at Daiso today.
5495800	5501320	Uh, DJ Rama S says, I feel this anytime I hear eighties and nineties
5501320	5502600	music on the classic stations.
5502640	5503880	Oh, it's even worse now.
5503880	5505000	It's like early 2000s.
5505000	5505640	Oh yeah.
5505640	5506240	That's agreed.
5506240	5509520	Oh no, you'll hear, I heard, I heard chili peppers on there actually.
5509520	5510720	Not like they're eighties.
5510760	5513720	They were playing like into, into like nineties stuff.
5513720	5516880	I heard Linkin Park on the classic rock station the other day.
5516880	5521080	And I was like, just take me now.
5522080	5525680	Well, what gets me is what the easy listening station sounds like now.
5526280	5529960	Like, am I, I remember when my mother would listen to the easy, easy
5529960	5532520	listening station, it was always captain and Tennille's muskrat
5532760	5534560	love on at any given moment.
5535400	5535960	I kid you not.
5536880	5539720	I've heard that song more often than I ever wanted to in my life.
5539960	5544880	Bobby Blackwolf points out Turner classic movies plays the matrix, a movie that was
5544880	5546800	released the same year as the game.com.
5546800	5551440	All right, I'm done.
5551600	5556240	All of the hosts, all of the hosts in unison were like, one, two, all of
5556240	5564800	the hosts in unison were like one, two, three, baseball at desk.
5565160	5566400	We don't need one, two switch.
5566400	5567600	We need one, two, what the fuck?
5570680	5571160	All right.
5571200	5573120	Anyway, uh, moving it.
5573120	5573920	That was also weird.
5573920	5577400	Cause when you turned off your camera, like they got to see the, the preview
5577400	5581840	shot and it went into infinity mirror mode where he saw the same shot over and over.
5583280	5583600	All right.
5584600	5587360	Anyway, uh, let's move on quickly.
5587360	5590120	We need to, we need to make ourselves feel better.
5590120	5591720	Let's do some rapid fire news.
5591720	5592720	I hope the news is good.
5593000	5595720	We'll travel around the industry quickly and look at some big headlines.
5595800	5596920	Uh, Loki, we'll start with you.
5597520	5600240	Yeah, we have another fundraiser going on with itch IO.
5600240	5605920	So this is where you can get almost 500 games for $5 through itch IO and it's to
5605920	5611760	help the Texas trends community, because if you, uh, are not familiar with what's
5611760	5616480	going on in the United States and specifically Texas and Florida, lots of
5616480	5621640	horrible things when it comes to, um, marginalized communities.
5621640	5622760	So that's great.
5623160	5625680	Thank you, thank you, Texas for being Texas.
5626040	5629520	Um, but at least this will hopefully help the fight against that.
5630560	5633160	So you can, uh, check that out on itch IO.
5633360	5634400	That's a great cause.
5634400	5640120	I mean, fuck all of that going on in Texas, that goes without saying and, uh, props
5640120	5642720	to the district attorneys that are standing up against it saying they're not
5642720	5643600	going to enforce it.
5644120	5650440	Um, but, uh, I I'm very, it always warms my heart just a little bit when I see
5650440	5654120	gaming companies, especially the indie developers who quite frankly could use
5654120	5659520	that money themselves, um, getting in on this sort of action, this really lovely
5660240	5660560	Yeah.
5660560	5665040	And it, it, the, the bundle in case you're looking for it is called TT RPGs for
5665040	5667680	trans rights in Texas bundle.
5668240	5675720	Um, so just search for that, um, on itch IO and then, um, so apparently the cuphead
5675720	5677800	show, which came out, I have not watched it.
5677800	5679720	My son binge watched the whole thing.
5680480	5681720	He said it was all right.
5682080	5685760	Um, so it's been renewed for a second season.
5685800	5687760	So apparently it is somewhat popular.
5687920	5690560	Um, so yeah, check it out on Netflix.
5690560	5691400	If you haven't seen it yet.
5691600	5693800	Have you heard the social media discourse on this?
5694520	5697560	Apparently one of the people, one of the people behind the scenes on this came out
5697560	5703000	and said, well, it's not really season two, it's the second half of episodes for
5703000	5707200	season one, and they're doing this to screw us all in our contracts and
5707200	5709360	animation gets treated like this all the time.
5709640	5713120	How do you think your animated series get turned around so fast and
5713120	5714560	suddenly there's new episodes?
5715280	5716840	So I thought, I thought that was interesting.
5716880	5720080	I mean, you know, obviously it doesn't, it doesn't lessen the quality of the
5720080	5722680	show or anything like that, but it just, it's just basically the whole thing
5722680	5725520	is to make Netflix look like assholes, you know, basically.
5725840	5728040	Um, but I thought, I thought that was interesting.
5728320	5729200	Mike deaf points out.
5729200	5731560	There are already 36 episodes in production.
5733040	5736640	So it's, it's not really a season two, but it's a continuation
5736640	5737440	of what already exists.
5737520	5741480	However, yeah, that there are more episodes.
5741560	5745520	Um, uh, Bobby Blackwell says contractually, they get a three point three to
5745520	5747480	five percent raise for a second season.
5747840	5751080	Netflix bought one season and is batching them.
5751120	5751960	That's what it is.
5752080	5753480	That's how they're getting screwed out of it.
5757080	5758120	Just something to think about.
5758120	5761000	I mean, not that it should necessarily stop you from watching or supporting
5761000	5764960	the show, but maybe buy some merch or put money into the creator's
5764960	5767160	pockets, uh, another way to, all right.
5767200	5768600	Uh, anyhow, dark soccer.
5769880	5775160	Well, um, there is a game called Mina, the hollower that is going to have guest
5775160	5780880	tracks from the legendary Yuzo Koshiro as in, you know, the, the person that
5780880	5784560	gave us the music and streets of rage act, razor, uh, super smash brothers,
5784560	5788040	I train Odyssey, um, uh, one gun, midnight, maximum tune.
5788680	5793840	Uh, I am, I'm honestly, I think that this would make me just want to play the game
5793840	5796880	anyway, but the game looks actually really whimsical and very cool.
5796920	5799720	So I might, I might be giving that one a try.
5800120	5805560	Um, also, uh, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3, and Resident Evil 7
5805600	5812040	Biohazard are, uh, coming to PS5 and Xbox series in 2022.
5812560	5818280	Um, so Capcom is going to be releasing those a little bit later this year.
5818520	5823680	If you already have them on PS4 or Xbox one, you can upgrade, uh, their
5823680	5827760	versions for the PS5 or Xbox series version at no additional cost.
5828360	5832960	Um, there will be, uh, upgrade patches available for PC users.
5833440	5838480	And I guess if you are on Stadia, like me, you don't have to wait
5838480	5839840	for a patch, it just happens.
5841040	5841560	Magic.
5842760	5848480	Oh, I still have my moments of giggle when Tuesdays and Steam goes down for
5848480	5850200	maintenance just for Dead by Daylight.
5850200	5851600	And I'm like, I'm playing right now.
5851800	5852840	Oh yeah.
5853120	5854520	Is it harder to get in a match though?
5854520	5855760	I guess you still have all the console people.
5856240	5856560	No.
5856960	5857280	Yeah.
5857360	5861000	And there are other Stadia, you know, gamers out there.
5861360	5862000	Not just me.
5862960	5863120	Yeah.
5863120	5863880	It's yeah.
5863880	5866480	Mostly I get into matches against, uh, console players.
5866760	5868760	It is definitely a drinking game though.
5868760	5872280	When you see it, what is this food that Alan is offering me off camera?
5872320	5874840	These are these, these chips you were talking about earlier.
5875400	5875720	Okay.
5875800	5878160	Wait, can you, can you lean in the mic and say what this is?
5879760	5880000	Yes.
5880000	5880840	Pajama pants on it.
5881360	5885600	Well, you gotta lean in there and say, you know, chip.
5888240	5888600	There.
5890520	5891080	They can't hear you.
5891080	5892000	You're under the noise gate.
5892000	5892800	You gotta get a lot closer.
5893080	5895000	Oh, the tips are made of meat.
5895720	5898760	They're keto chips, protein, and they're very thinly sliced.
5898800	5899320	Yum.
5900040	5900440	Yes.
5902760	5903520	Meat's good.
5905440	5906760	That's not the worst thing I've ever had.
5906760	5910520	I was expecting it worse, but I wouldn't want to like eat an entire bag of those,
5910520	5911360	but I guess that's the point.
5912480	5912880	Anyway.
5914040	5914480	Sorry about that.
5914480	5916880	Microwave bacon enough and it'll become chip like.
5917400	5919400	Oh, that's a horrible aftertaste though.
5919440	5919920	Blah.
5920560	5922920	Uh, DJ Rama says, is that Alan or evil Alan?
5922920	5923120	Okay.
5923120	5927720	So for those on the podcast, Alan has a very full beard right now and it's something
5927720	5929360	his hairstylist talked him into doing.
5929360	5931920	And it is, it is a very, it is a lovely beard.
5931960	5937400	Um, so it's, it's something he's, I will be losing my beard in the next, uh, probably
5937400	5937960	next week.
5938200	5938800	I will not have it.
5938800	5940600	So my suspicion I believe is correct.
5941160	5942600	So what's that?
5943160	5945200	My suspicion I believe is correct.
5945800	5946400	Potentially.
5946400	5947160	I'll text you.
5947800	5948360	So, okay.
5949120	5949560	All right.
5949920	5952560	But, uh, yeah, my, I'm going to be losing my beard for about a month.
5953760	5954240	All right.
5955240	5959680	Um, moving on, let's, uh, travel around the world and check out some, we get both
5959680	5960400	your stories, dark soccer.
5960400	5960840	I'm sorry.
5961280	5961680	Yeah.
5961800	5962120	Okay.
5962320	5964400	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5965160	5966240	Starting in the U S all right.
5966720	5972520	So we've got spell force three re-forced on PlayStation four, PlayStation five,
5972520	5979760	Xbox one, Xbox series, uh, dot hack GU last recode on Nintendo switch, Aztec
5979760	5984320	forgotten gods on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox
5984320	5989400	one and Xbox series, chocobo GP on Nintendo switch.
5989960	5994760	And I can't pronounce this one, but we're going to try.
5994800	6001240	Uh, it's looks like, uh, don't use say bang in summer on PC.
6001480	6005280	And then of course, WWE two K 22.
6005280	6009160	Hopefully this one doesn't suck on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation
6009160	6010840	five, Xbox one, Xbox series.
6011080	6014240	That's seriously this subtitle on it that I added.
6016080	6016640	All right.
6017680	6019480	Uh, let's go to Japan right now.
6019480	6020160	Get in the plane.
6020600	6023400	Um, on the Nintendo switch this week in Japan.
6023440	6024560	Oh, this is exciting.
6025120	6029400	Dot hack GU last recode is out on the switch this week.
6029400	6034840	Is this the, is this a remake of like the whole, or is this just one of the games?
6035800	6040080	Uh, it is four parts from volumes one to volume four rebirth,
6040080	6042000	reminisce, redemption, and reconnection.
6042720	6043000	Okay.
6043640	6049600	So that is out, uh, this week in Japan on the 10th, uh, on Mario day, uh, also coming
6049600	6053480	out on the Nintendo switch this week, chocobo GP a Yay.
6053480	6054440	I'm excited to play that.
6054440	6055080	That's for sure.
6055480	6057960	Um, hopefully it's not too micro.
6058400	6062440	As you know, square Enix is in hot water right now for microtransactions, because
6062440	6065160	apparently that Babylon's fall game.
6065600	6066760	We didn't talk a lot about that.
6066760	6073520	Babylon's fall game is apparently flopped fucking hard because, uh, steam
6073520	6077040	is only showing that like a thousand people were playing it at its peak.
6077520	6079360	And that's barely Babylon's fall.
6079680	6079840	Yeah.
6079840	6080720	Babylon's fall.
6081240	6084600	Uh, is that, uh, that is the game that square Enix made with platinum
6084600	6087960	games, uh, it was also in the news because it was reusing some of the
6087960	6092640	assets from final fantasy 14, uh, there it's, it seems like it's like, it's
6092640	6095800	this full price game and it's like a micro microtransaction paradise.
6096160	6098880	Apparently, but a lot of people were looking forward to platinum and
6098880	6100080	square Enix getting together.
6100080	6101840	And apparently it is not worth the wait.
6102320	6106640	Um, it is very obviously shoehorned full of microtransactions and quite frankly
6106640	6108120	probably should have been play.
6108600	6112040	Um, so anyway, uh, yeah.
6112080	6115480	Some folks in chat quest buster says, Oh no, Babylon's fall.
6115760	6116320	Uh, orange.
6116320	6116560	Right.
6116560	6118920	Says Babylon's fail indeed.
6119440	6119920	Or no.
6120640	6120920	Oh no.
6120920	6121920	It says Babylon's fall.
6121920	6122240	Indeed.
6122240	6125480	I read that like Babylon's fail, but that's almost even better.
6125480	6125800	Orange.
6125800	6125960	Right.
6125960	6126920	I made your comment better.
6128240	6129560	See you in the intro tonight.
6129560	6130720	I said Babylon's flop.
6130720	6132400	I should have done Babylon fail.
6132640	6133720	Oh, there's always next week.
6133720	6134120	All right.
6134600	6137120	Uh, let's see what else do we want to do for release dates?
6137120	6137440	Oh yes.
6137440	6138200	Back to Japan.
6138200	6138560	Sorry.
6138920	6141320	Let's talk about the games coming out next week and on the PlayStation
6141320	6145920	five, uh, the medium gets a Japanese release on the PlayStation five.
6145920	6149960	I believe that was exclusive to series X on the U S so that probably
6149960	6154480	explains that and then a sass is creed Valhalla, the Ragnarok edition is out
6154480	6155680	on the PlayStation five this week.
6156480	6159000	Can a dark Sakura.
6160080	6160440	What do you have?
6160440	6167200	So we have, uh, coming out, we have on the eighth for PlayStation and
6167200	6170280	Xbox, we have WWE, two K 22 deluxe edition.
6170760	6174280	On the 10th for the same, we have assassin's creed Valhalla, Donna
6174280	6179520	Ragnarok, we have also on the 10th chocobo GP for the switch.
6179960	6182840	Um, the rest of these are on the 11th.
6182840	6187080	We have road redemption for PlayStation hotel, Transylvania, scary
6187080	6189280	tales adventure for the big three.
6189600	6193920	W W E E two K 22 for PlayStation, Xbox.
6194680	6198800	Hula on, uh, March 11th again for PlayStation and switch.
6199240	6200480	And that will do it.
6202360	6203120	All right.
6203640	6205800	We just have a few more stories for you guys, and then we're
6205800	6207600	going to get to some emails.
6207600	6211480	I know we have at least one email tonight and, uh, we will have maybe some calls.
6211480	6212480	We'll see what happens there.
6212800	6218120	So, uh, in the meantime, let's get to our next story.
6218960	6219520	Yeah, I believe it.
6219720	6225120	So, so Sony, um, is basically, or Sony air active entertainment.
6225120	6229600	Japan has announced that they're going to be ending support or after
6229600	6234360	sales support, so the repairs refurbishment of anything, uh, PlayStation
6234360	6239880	three hardware peripherals as of April 30th, 2022, they're citing that it's
6239880	6244280	due to the lack of parts and their inventory, and they'll no longer be
6244280	6250160	able to provide those services after, um, that date, of course, I'm sure
6250160	6252760	there's aftermarket stuff that you could do to fix your consoles if you
6252760	6256800	need to, but, uh, Sony themselves will not be supporting the PlayStation
6256800	6259000	three any longer, which I mean, it makes sense.
6259000	6263040	It's been out of circulation for quite a while now.
6263040	6264800	So not surprised.
6268000	6269280	Um, yeah.
6271480	6272160	All right.
6272480	6277280	So, I mean, it seems like Tony's just been trying to slowly get the PlayStation
6277280	6281400	three and the PlayStation Vita, like outside of the, like, you know, slowly
6281400	6285960	getting it out, um, but, uh, and this kind of goes right along with that.
6286400	6289760	How long until they officially try to shut down the stores again
6289760	6291800	online and not get no idea.
6295000	6295440	All right.
6296000	6298400	Uh, well, something I think we're a little more excited about, at least
6298400	6300560	I I'm, I I'm interested in this dark soccer.
6300560	6301680	I imagine you have to be right.
6304320	6304880	Oh yeah.
6305000	6307960	Um, so, uh, all right.
6307960	6310480	I have, I have to, I have to phrase this in one particular way.
6310640	6311400	I'm getting this.
6312360	6313280	We're starting off with that.
6313600	6314280	It will happen.
6314560	6317360	And I'll tell you how I heard about it was watching one of
6317400	6320320	polyester's, uh, YouTube, uh, things.
6320320	6324360	Cause usually I'll get like blood point codes from him first.
6325040	6331680	Um, but he talks about, um, uh, a tweet that behavior made in conjunction
6331680	6336520	with level 99 games, uh, which is a group that has done like video game
6336520	6338640	inspired board games and card games.
6339040	6341200	They are doing a dead by daylight game.
6341560	6345000	And, uh, there's a Kickstarter launching on March 29th.
6345560	6347960	Um, I, I am going to have this game.
6348720	6353480	There will be a standard edition for $49.99 with six killers and seven
6353480	6357840	survivors and two maps and the collector's edition with 16 killers, 17
6357840	6359920	survivors and four maps for a hundred bucks.
6360040	6365040	Um, this is, if someone wants to get me a birthday present, by the way, you
6365040	6367720	know, this, this order is coming up for my birthday.
6368480	6374320	Um, and I, I imagine none of the licensed killers that, you know, DVD is known for,
6374320	6377000	I imagine they would have to license those separately for this.
6377000	6378520	So we probably won't see any of them.
6379440	6379640	Yeah.
6379640	6385720	Like among the ones I could see, we have like a, a nurse, we have a trapper.
6385720	6391240	We have a, a DeWitt, we have a, a Meglet, we have a Jake characters.
6391440	6392680	You know, I'm really surprised.
6392680	6394560	I know we talk about this game a lot on the show.
6394600	6397520	I'm sorry, but also not sorry because you know, not sorry at all.
6397560	6398440	It's been around a while.
6398760	6403360	Um, but I'm kind of surprised they haven't tried to make, I haven't, I'm
6403360	6406640	surprised it hasn't gone full circle where they haven't tried to make a
6406640	6407920	horror movie out of it yet.
6408440	6412200	I mean, maybe it would just be a very hard story to write because, um, you
6412200	6415160	know, like without getting too in the weeds, I don't want to go too far into
6415160	6418160	it for the people who aren't into Dead by Daylight, but basically it's like,
6418160	6422920	you know, they exist in this place where they fight and fight and fight again.
6422960	6425040	Basically they're for the entity's amusement.
6425120	6426480	They are, you know, dying over and over.
6426480	6429600	It's not for the, as far as I'm aware, it's not actually for the entity's
6429600	6431680	amusements, it's for the entity's nourishment.
6431920	6432600	Ah, okay.
6432840	6436800	So, well, you know, eating makes me happy, but anyway, yes, yes.
6437000	6437920	For the entity's nourishment.
6438040	6442080	So, but it's just surprising that there is, hasn't been a movie to try to, you
6442080	6447720	know, to, for things to come full circle where like Dwight, Meg, Claudette, you
6447720	6454280	know, the hag, the trapper, the doctor are not like horror icons in cinema as well.
6454280	6456320	I'm really surprised that hasn't happened yet.
6456320	6459640	Somebody's gotta be pitching it or trying it, but it's going to take
6459640	6461160	the right script to make it work.
6461280	6463320	Because again, I don't know how it works as a movie.
6464080	6467400	I'll tell you what though, and it's a long read.
6467400	6467680	Okay.
6467680	6469880	It is a long and glorious read.
6470400	6475120	It's like a 70 chapter fanfic that I found and read to its completion because
6475120	6481960	it was as good as any novel that I have read, amazing writing, um, all of the
6481960	6485960	characters were very fleshed out, you know, very headcanony, um, and there's
6485960	6491680	one thing that, that I like good fanfiction, I'm a fanfic writer myself.
6491720	6496320	Um, there's one thing that is in lore that never made sense to me, and that's
6496320	6501480	that the survivors forget everything after they've come out of a match, but
6501480	6507040	yet they, they're talking about having been in their matches and, and things.
6507040	6512920	So that's sort of like a inconsistency in lore, but, uh, I'll have to find this
6512920	6516040	story, I'm going to have to put it somewhere for people to read because
6516040	6520680	it is absolutely amazing, and if somebody wants like their ultimate
6520680	6524480	Dead by Daylight story, you need to read this one, it's really good.
6524960	6530200	So, um, at any rate, I was gonna say, Tiger Claw in Chat asks, the question
6530200	6532120	is, will the movie version be any good?
6532440	6536040	Well, if the track record for video game movies tells us anything,
6536040	6537480	the answer is probably not.
6537800	6540560	Um, although I guess recent, recently they've been getting better.
6540560	6543160	I mean, a lot of people enjoyed the Sonic movie, the new Mortal
6543160	6546960	Combat apparently didn't suck, you know, apparently they're getting better.
6547280	6548800	Um, but they still got a ways to go.
6550760	6555800	Well, I think, I think that's entirely possible for like, if it were me, I
6555800	6561920	would actually budget for a trilogy and have like different aspects, like be,
6562400	6565880	you know, the, like the first movie, the first main four, and maybe the
6565880	6568440	first three original killers.
6568440	6568920	What was it?
6568920	6571880	Trapper Billy and, uh, Wraith?
6572320	6573280	Yeah, Trapper Billy and Wraith.
6573320	6576160	Maybe throw Sally in there cause she was the fourth, the nurse.
6577760	6581880	And have it be like their interaction, you know, stuff like that.
6581880	6585040	Like I'd even like throw in stuff from the killer's perspective.
6585040	6588320	Like they're like, maybe they were tricked into doing it or forced into
6588320	6591320	doing it or have no choice but to do it or they get punished or something like that.
6591800	6595400	And then the second one, move on to like a different DLC group, you know,
6595400	6600320	bring in like Kate and, and the clown and, you know, clown would be creepy
6600320	6603280	as fuck in a movie, nevermind, um, but do something like that.
6603280	6606960	Like I would, I would watch it, even if it's not great, I would probably
6606960	6609960	still watch it cause I mean, you know, the kind of shit movies I like.
6609960	6611440	And also most horror movies.
6611440	6614680	And I, I say, you know, you all know how I feel about gore and stuff like that,
6614680	6620240	but even like the most horror movies aren't great there, but they're
6620240	6621920	comfort food for a lot of people.
6621920	6624240	And as I'm getting to know more and more people in the community and
6624280	6625680	it's, it's, it's comfort food.
6626120	6627800	It's not great necessarily.
6627800	6629280	Like, like most comfort food.
6629800	6631080	Um, let's see.
6631120	6634640	Um, and Tiger Claw to answer your question, there's not really a main
6634640	6636280	character, although people will say Dwight.
6636520	6640880	Um, it's, it doesn't really have a major narrative.
6640880	6644840	Some of the lore is really inconsistent with itself and like for the ones
6644840	6649960	that borrow from franchises, those, actually, I'll take that back.
6650000	6652960	Most of the, most of those actually had to have some rewriting done to them.
6653480	6657760	Um, although, uh, the pig from Saw, her stuff is actually pretty consistent.
6658280	6664240	And, um, the Sadako one is actually official, officially recognized, uh, by
6664280	6670600	the, the, the owner of, of the whole Ringu franchise, including making Yoichi,
6670800	6676440	who was a kid in the first two movies, uh, actually making his adulthood story canon.
6677040	6682840	For, so Sadako and Yoichi in Dead by Daylight is canon for the
6682880	6683960	Ringu universe.
6684080	6686760	They, they really, and, you know, again, I know we talk a lot about this game,
6686760	6690200	but they, they really went out of their way to make Sadako work in Dead by
6690200	6694280	Daylight too, because they, they made the care to believe Sadako doesn't
6694280	6698760	kill anyone by her own hand and they really, they really went out of their
6698760	6702120	way with the graphics and everything to make it so that she's using psychic
6702120	6704320	abilities, everything she does is psychic abilities.
6704720	6710320	That was actually a, um, uh, a requirement put out by, was it Kodansha?
6710320	6711760	I think it was Kodansha or Kadokawa.
6711800	6712960	I have to look them up again.
6713480	6715960	Um, but it was actually a requirement of the company
6716000	6718160	that she not touch anybody.
6719040	6725760	Um, so that led to that, that the TVs be present, that the, the tape be included
6725760	6729280	in it, that, you know, her story involved, you know, water for some reason.
6729600	6732320	Well, I mean, I know why it involved water, but that's going back to the story.
6732720	6735760	Um, there is actually one other little bit of Dead by Daylight news.
6736520	6736800	Okay.
6736800	6737200	Quickly.
6737840	6738160	All right.
6738720	6745120	They, um, according to DBD leaks, um, they have, uh, uh, trademarked, hooked
6745160	6747840	on you a Dead by Daylight dating sim.
6748360	6750680	Is this, I thought I just wrote that off as bullshit.
6750680	6751520	This is real.
6752120	6752720	This is real.
6753160	6755960	It maybe it's gotta be an April fool's prank in the game.
6756680	6757320	It's gotta be.
6757360	6759760	This was on February 21st.
6760200	6760760	Oh Lord.
6760760	6761840	It's gotta be a tome.
6762360	6763160	Gonna be a prank.
6763440	6764520	Um, all right.
6764520	6766840	Filed on February 16th, 2022.
6767080	6770200	This is computer video game, combat discards, your blah, blah, blah.
6770240	6772120	Mobile device possibly.
6772720	6777680	Um, but this is, uh, actually saying a downloadable computer software for
6777680	6779640	mobile phone games for playing video games.
6779640	6783320	This is actually registered as a full game.
6784480	6785480	Let me Loki.
6785480	6787040	I know you don't follow dead by daylight.
6787040	6788840	So let me try to explain this to you.
6788840	6791560	Just how horny most of the DBD community is.
6791960	6793120	Oh, we got some thirsty people.
6793400	6795480	So internet community, horny.
6795560	6801800	Anytime, anytime the official DBD makes a post, the first reply, the top
6801800	6803840	reply will always inevitably be B.
6804120	6806760	When are you adding sex to death by daylight?
6807800	6812520	Or people saying in order to die in a horror movie, you have to have sex first.
6812720	6815120	When will Dwight and David be able to have sex?
6817520	6818360	Always.
6819920	6820760	Always.
6821680	6823400	And then look at the fan art.
6823800	6825000	I'm not even going to go there.
6825280	6828640	The fan art there's, there's choices.
6828720	6831000	There's some choices that people are making in the fan art.
6831160	6831440	Okay.
6831440	6831840	Anyway.
6832280	6836120	Um, I do want to say real quick, because going back to video game movies,
6836360	6838560	tiger claw reminded me, Oh yeah.
6838560	6841080	One just came out completely.
6841080	6842840	Didn't even notice for me.
6843280	6844760	And the uncharted movie.
6844840	6845280	Hello.
6846240	6846640	Did y'all know?
6846640	6848320	And yeah, right.
6848360	6849840	I was like, Oh, I knew it came out.
6849840	6851120	I had no interest in it.
6851440	6851880	Yeah.
6851880	6853120	They did do an uncharted movie.
6853120	6853800	Didn't they?
6855680	6856080	All right.
6857520	6857800	All right.
6857800	6858520	Let's move on.
6858520	6859160	Let's move on.
6859240	6862200	Uh, if you dated Sally, would she be into asphyxiation?
6862200	6863880	Oh no, don't stop.
6863880	6864160	All right.
6864200	6866080	Uh, moving on Loki.
6867240	6872120	So Tokyo game show this year is actually going to be returning as a physical event.
6872920	6879240	Um, I guess it, you know, events are starting to go physical again because
6879240	6884200	you know, it's starting to become, you know, an endemic, I guess.
6884600	6889240	Uh, you know, over the two years, they say of various fun events
6889240	6892320	disappeared from our daily lives, but games still lighten up our days.
6892320	6896120	Games will continue to brighten up days of everybody now and forever
6896120	6900760	until they die from COVID, uh, theme implies such strong determination.
6901280	6904920	Um, unprecedented excitement is always born out of something
6904920	6905960	you have never imagined.
6905960	6911280	This is a whole bunch of fluff and nothing stops game except for death.
6911320	6912560	And then, uh, yeah.
6912880	6918400	So I, they're going to be, I went to a big event in 2021.
6918680	6922160	It had precautions and I think if they have, I mean, I don't
6922160	6923400	know what the precautions are.
6923800	6927160	So until I hear them, I can understand, but if they have precautions,
6928400	6929320	I think it'll be all right.
6929440	6932560	I don't, it's not going to, they don't outline any precautions so far.
6932560	6935600	So, and everybody, everybody has to assess their own risk in that regard.
6936040	6936200	Yeah.
6938640	6942200	Um, but I'm not surprised that it's, I mean, it's going to eventually happen.
6942240	6946440	Cause this is well, but also this, I mean, this is way out in what?
6946440	6949560	October, November, October is just Tokyo game show, right?
6949600	6949800	Yeah.
6949800	6950960	It's September, October.
6950960	6955760	I mean, they, they, we don't know if another variant will show up.
6955880	6957760	I mean, let's fucking hope not.
6958240	6962240	And a lot of scientists seem to think that if a variant shows up, it's going
6962240	6967040	to trend the way Omicron did, where it's more transmissible, less dangerous.
6967600	6969400	Um, hopefully fingers crossed.
6969400	6974520	But again, we don't fucking know until it shows up because they say it might go
6974520	6976320	that way, but it could go the other way.
6976640	6978360	So we'll see.
6978840	6981480	Um, so who knows what happens before September.
6981960	6985120	And you know, as somebody who would like to get back to doing some of these
6985120	6988320	events, again, I'm happy to wear a mask more than happy to get the shot, get
6988320	6991280	vaccinated, love to see everyone around me and be that way as well.
6991440	6993600	I'm happy to take precautions, precautions work.
6994160	6999360	Um, I just, I, I, some of this coming back will be nice, but again, if
6999360	7002640	another variant shows up, I expect it to all go away like that if it's
7002640	7005000	worse, which would be a bummer.
7006480	7010440	But yeah, it's sure with everything else going on in the world, the focus
7010480	7012920	sure fell off COVID real quick, didn't it?
7013920	7015320	It's just interesting.
7015840	7017920	I mean, I get it, but it is interesting.
7019000	7019920	All right, moving on.
7020000	7023120	Uh, I have one more story before we get to the listener round table.
7023120	7026880	And that has to do with a very, and it's something Jason referenced in the intro
7026880	7030880	about, uh, an interesting little story here with a missing game award for the
7030880	7037240	game Celeste, of course, Celeste came out in 2018 and won two awards at the game
7037240	7040520	awards games for impact and best independent game.
7041000	7043760	Uh, and many people are still experiencing this game for the first
7043760	7047120	time now that's what four years later, because, you know, Microsoft game pass,
7047120	7051040	or just, you know, uh, it shows up a lot in these indie bundles and so forth.
7051360	7057200	Um, apparently though the developer of the game, extremely okay games, never
7057200	7059480	received one of the physical awards.
7059560	7060360	It went missing.
7061200	7066280	Um, apparently, uh, there was going scouring on the internet about trying
7066280	7070480	to find a replica of the game board trophies, and there was a listing on
7070480	7073160	eBay and it was a real award.
7073840	7077120	So this streamer prestige is key.
7077240	7081920	Who's a YouTube streamer actually bid on the item and won it.
7082480	7089240	And when they got it, they saw that, Oh, this is the missing Celeste 2018 award.
7090200	7093000	And so he set it back basically.
7093280	7097400	Um, when he asked the seller where it came from, they didn't really get an answer
7097480	7099840	other than just liquidation sources.
7100800	7104240	That almost sounds like a pawn shop or something like a pawn shop could
7104240	7106040	sell it, so they put it on eBay.
7106040	7109560	I don't know, but I'm making it up a little bit, but it definitely sounds like
7109560	7111240	somebody else offloaded this somewhere.
7111800	7115840	Um, so yeah, I thought that was, uh, I thought that was interesting.
7116240	7119240	Uh, after figuring out that, or after prestige figured out that
7119240	7121040	this was actually a real award.
7121200	7125200	He got in touch with the studio and got it back with it, but got it back to them
7125520	7130800	in exchange, extremely okay, sent some signed copies of Celeste and reimbursed
7130800	7132760	for the auction and shipping costs.
7132920	7137280	So that's very nice of them to reimburse after doing that nice gesture there.
7137280	7140160	So it is a nice little feel good story to end on.
7140160	7142160	Although of course it also begs the question.
7142160	7142320	Yeah.
7142320	7143560	Like tiger class doesn't chat.
7143960	7145800	How the hell did it get lost in the first place?
7146120	7149480	Well, you know, when you get an award at these types of things, like the
7149480	7154280	Oscars, I think are like this, the Oscars may actually be different, but
7154280	7159800	most award shows when you get a trophy, you're accepting a fake statue.
7160000	7162600	It's a statue, but it's unengraved.
7163040	7168120	So when you go backstage, You hand the statue back over to the handler who ends
7168120	7172520	up reusing it with every person that cycles through the stage, because you get
7172520	7176960	a real one in the mail or some other type of delivery method, you know, signed
7176960	7182160	for FedEx, you get a real one that's engraved and has all your information
7182160	7187480	on it that actually says best podcast, orange lounge radio engraved on it.
7187480	7193320	Although actually, funny enough, the podcast awards back in 2006, when we
7193320	7198080	won our podcast award, when grandma and grandpa won podcast awards, uh, it was
7198080	7199360	already engraved, wasn't it?
7199360	7201160	Dark Sakura with our name.
7201160	7201400	Yeah.
7201680	7201960	Yeah.
7202000	7205000	So sometimes they do it all in advance.
7205000	7209400	It just depends on the award show, but the Oscars, I mean, the award we got
7209400	7212080	was, was not expensive.
7212080	7212400	Okay.
7212400	7216160	But it was, Hey, we appreciate it all the same, but we know it was a low
7216160	7217800	budget award and that's fine.
7218240	7222680	Uh, but for the Oscars, which are like solid fucking gold, they
7222680	7223560	send those out to be.
7224400	7228320	So I think this is, I think this is similar to what the game award, uh,
7228320	7231680	E3VL says, why don't they just give them the real one when they accept the award?
7232000	7233800	Um, a variety of reasons.
7233800	7236080	I think getting lost amongst the evening.
7236080	7242280	Cause think about, think about the outfits that lady Gaga wears to the
7242280	7245840	Oscars, where is she going to put a fucking statue?
7246400	7247840	Well, she won't this year.
7248200	7248640	Ouch.
7249360	7252360	But when she wins best song, where does she put that
7252360	7254280	fucking statue in her purse?
7255280	7256240	Like where did she put it?
7256240	7257600	It's a placeholder statue.
7257760	7258040	Yeah.
7258040	7261920	So there's, I think logistically, there's a lot of reasons they do it that way.
7261920	7267600	And just, you know, but, but, um, I think that's also, they want to keep, keep it a
7267600	7268080	secret.
7268600	7273080	If they engrave all the awards, they know who the person who engraved it knows who
7273120	7277320	won, somebody who transports it to the venue knows who won and they
7277320	7279320	make a big deal at the Oscars.
7279480	7280840	They always show at the Oscars.
7281200	7284760	Here's the two people from prime and Westing, whatever that name of that
7284760	7288920	company is that does all the tabulation, Westinghouse, here are the only two
7288920	7292840	people in the world that know who won the Oscars because they did the tabulation.
7293240	7294840	It's all part of that basically.
7296160	7299600	So, uh, fifth dream says the real Oscars are DLC.
7299600	7302400	You get them once the show is finished to avoid crunch.
7303120	7303480	Sure.
7304120	7305640	We're the friends we made along the way.
7307920	7309960	We'll use that story here at orange launch radio.
7309960	7310560	Yes, we will.
7311200	7311720	All right.

7331320	7332320	I know where there's at least one.
7332440	7333920	It's a long one, but a good one.
7333960	7334200	Yeah.
7334200	7335760	Participate at orange launch radio.com.
7337000	7337840	Hello, LR.
7337880	7339480	Congrats on the new dig.
7339480	7343240	Sorry, but I just had to write in following last week's episode, you
7343240	7346840	mentioned Tempest 4,000 re-releasing on Switch in about two weeks, and I'm glad
7346840	7347280	you did.
7347600	7352640	It's the latest and quite possibly the last in Jeff Mintner's, uh, long running
7352640	7355360	series of really cool and trippy Tempest remakes.
7355560	7359480	The first of these was Tempest 2000 on Jaguar dating all the way back to 1994.
7359520	7359760	Wow.
7359760	7361040	That's over 25 years ago.
7361600	7364800	Uh, Tempest, uh, I lost my place.
7365760	7369560	Uh, Tempest 3000 was actually released on the short lived Nuon platform.
7369560	7370560	That's right on Nuon.
7370840	7375800	Nuon was technology that included Samsung and Toshiba DVD players that expanded the
7375800	7377600	feature set, but also supported gaming.
7377640	7379560	I did play on one of those, by the way.
7379560	7380880	So I have played Tempest 3000.
7381360	7385520	Do not forget Tempest 2000 also came out on Sega Saturn, which is copy I have.
7386080	7387600	So back, back to the email.
7388280	7394680	Um, let's see, uh, but in 2000 and 2001, only four movies and eight games were ever
7394680	7397400	released for the platform and nothing else shipped after that.
7397400	7399760	Tempest 3000 was never ported to another platform.
7400120	7405760	And this concept was not seen again until 2014 when Llamasoft released TXK on
7405760	7408960	PlayStation Vita, which I have on PlayStation TV, and it is lots of fun.
7409440	7413240	Um, this is the game that would have released on the Switch, if not for the
7413240	7416920	fact that Atari threatened legal action, barring Mintner from releasing the game
7416920	7421480	on any other platforms, but to everyone's surprise, a remixed version of TXK
7421480	7424720	resurfaced in 2018, as you guessed it, Tempest 4000.
7425120	7428920	Llamasoft developed it and Atari released it to PS4 and Xbox.
7429360	7433840	As someone who has played a bit of both games, I must admit, I prefer TXK.
7433840	7436480	The difficulty ramps up more smoothly and the game is easier
7436480	7437960	overall than Tempest 4000.
7438400	7441760	So if you still have a Vita kicking around, I would highly recommend that
7441760	7443840	you grab a TXK while you still can.
7444240	7447400	The other tragedy is that TXK was supposed to have a VR mode when
7447400	7451080	it was released on PS4, but Atari opted not to include it in Tempest 4000.
7451520	7454200	So for your Llamasoft PSVR fix, you'll have to play
7454200	7455960	Polybius or Moose Life instead.
7456800	7457040	Yeah.
7457080	7461680	And also it is, I believe still available for PSTV, just throwing that out there.
7461960	7467120	Um, and then now that like YYR and by the hello, now that YYR spelled that out,
7467600	7470960	I'm like, oh, I do remember talking about this on the show in stages
7470960	7473480	because I remember that whole lawsuit thing that was going on.
7473480	7477480	So thank you for like writing the book report summary, cliff note version of that.
7477560	7479800	So thank you for, for like aligning us there.
7480440	7483040	But do you remember when I had my footage of playing
7483040	7484880	Tempest 3000 at Atari party?
7485880	7486400	Oh yeah.
7486400	7487560	I miss Atari party.
7487560	7489920	I know that guy moved and obviously the, the, well,
7490560	7494040	actually I think that Dan and one other person was left in
7494040	7495800	charge of the Atari party name.
7496440	7499960	Oh, it's just a matter of getting everything arranged for it.
7500160	7501560	I'm sure the pandemic didn't help.
7502280	7502960	No, it did not.
7503120	7507400	But, um, but I think Atari party could come back to saying,
7508040	7509760	I'm just, I'm just going to throw it out there.
7509800	7511800	I, and I, I haven't talked to Bobby about this.
7511800	7513320	I'm going to put my foot in my mouth big time.
7514000	7515880	Bog network presents Atari party.
7515880	7520480	I would just saying I, we could talk and maybe make some things happen.
7520520	7520920	We'll see.
7521200	7521960	Let me tell it to Dan.
7522200	7522400	Okay.
7523440	7523680	Okay.
7524480	7525440	You heard it here first.
7525480	7527680	Maybe, maybe I might, I might.
7527680	7530760	I might've just put myself in a lot of trouble, but we'll see.
7530800	7531160	Cause I,
7531240	7532840	let me finish the email cause it's long.
7533000	7534760	Everybody's asking when's OLR Cod?
7534760	7535560	When's OLR Cod?
7535560	7537800	Well, maybe there's the email.
7537800	7538200	Oh, shut up.
7538200	7538520	Sorry.
7539760	7541800	The classic game of the week was Metroid fusion.
7541840	7544760	This game is meaningful to me in a number of, uh, in a
7544760	7546160	different way than you would expect.
7546480	7548480	Brace yourself for my unpopular opinion on this game.
7548480	7551960	It was the greatest disappointment I'd ever experienced across 35 or so
7551960	7553240	years I've been playing video games.
7553600	7555840	Hear me out besides the great action and tight controls.
7555840	7559480	The main reason I love the Metroid series is because it drops you into
7559480	7562240	a strange and unfamiliar world than tasks you with exploring it.
7562640	7565400	The quest of exploring the world, finding new abilities and figuring
7565400	7568720	out how to harness those abilities to explore even more of the world.
7569080	7572400	Led to some of my very favorite moments across the whole series, but Metroid
7572400	7573720	fusion doesn't give you any of that.
7574120	7577760	It moves in a linear fashion through one area of a space station, then to the
7577760	7582360	next area, then to the next, after that, as a computer instructs you to go here,
7582360	7586600	kill this, do that, the exploration is non-existent apart from finding a
7586640	7591360	couple of small secret areas, and you don't even have to find the abilities
7591360	7593480	as they're given to you automatically when you defeat bosses.
7594320	7597160	Yeah, but the thing is that you're going to retrieve your stuff from these
7597160	7598960	bosses, so that makes sense, but still.
7599360	7602800	Uh, the high difficulty of the game comes exclusively from the fact
7602840	7607080	that they do more damage to you, making the difficulty artificial.
7607520	7610120	It's a decent action game, but in my humble opinion, it is
7610120	7611280	not a Metroid game at all.
7611560	7612800	Oh, everyone's wrong sometimes.
7613560	7618200	I still never forget eagerly anticipating Metroid fusion and expecting
7618200	7619640	Metroid prime to be disappointing.
7620120	7621560	But then the complete opposite happened.
7621560	7624680	I found Metroid fusion to be an utter disappointment and prime blew me away.
7625280	7628920	So I'll close asking what is that new ultra music last week?
7628920	7631840	It sounded so familiar anyway, happy gaming and enjoy your week.
7632120	7633960	Embracing the popular Aaron YYR.
7634520	7635960	Um, I don't remember if I said it on air.
7635960	7637120	I might've said it after the show.
7637120	7638400	So let me acknowledge on air.
7638440	7641880	Um, DJ Roma S made us a new credit sequence, um, to just kind of go with
7641920	7645960	the recent makeover here at OLR with my move, um, and, uh, decided
7645960	7648360	to change up the credit music, but I'm, I'm all right with it.
7648360	7651440	You know, we've been using the Corona trigger song for a long time.
7651760	7653640	So, uh, the new song is the ending.
7655520	7656960	It's just, it's just that simple.
7657000	7661400	It is the ending to Mario brothers three, but that's why it sounds familiar.
7661400	7661800	I'm sure.
7662200	7663240	So thank you so much.
7663240	7664120	Why we are for the email.
7664120	7664920	Really appreciate that.
7664920	7669320	And, um, in defense of YYR is opinion, although certainly everybody's entitled
7669320	7672520	to their opinion on games and there's always games that like people are going
7672520	7676840	to love that some of us aren't going to get, and again, I said a RE I said a
7676840	7682000	recent example, uh, Elden ring, and I've even watched people play it and I'm not
7682000	7684080	looking at Elden ring going, it's a bad game.
7684080	7685160	It's not a bad game.
7685520	7687160	It's just not zero interest in playing it.
7687200	7687920	It's not for me.
7688320	7689320	And that's okay.
7689320	7690880	Not everything has to be about me.
7691680	7693680	Contrary to what people say about me behind my back.
7693960	7695640	Not everything has to be about me though.
7695760	7696240	Just saying.
7696240	7704080	So, um, you know, that's, uh, you know, not everything, but with the Metroid
7704080	7708800	thing, I'm actually gonna somewhat, I don't always agree with YYR on how he
7708800	7713720	feels about this game, but this most recent Metroid game, Metroid dread.
7714600	7717880	Some of these issues you raise are some things that kind of
7717880	7719280	bother me about Metroid dread.
7719920	7726680	I don't love the chase and stealth stuff because the way I play Metroid
7726920	7732200	historically has always been very slow and meticulous and exploring.
7732800	7737200	So when Metroid thrust that on me, I wasn't like, it took
7737200	7738480	me a minute to get used to it.
7738520	7744280	I appreciate Metroid dread now, but at, in that moment I was a little
7744280	7749680	thrown and I'm not sure it is like, it's it, well, it's not, it's not
7749680	7751840	as good as, um, super Metroid for me.
7753280	7755800	So, you know, and, and, uh, some other Metroid games as well.
7755920	7762400	So just, you know, I, I just kind of say, and for, uh, uh, YYR sake, I
7762400	7767560	understand why a certain change to the formula throws you off because that's
7767560	7769120	what I've been experiencing with Metroid dread.
7771240	7771840	All right.
7772400	7774760	Anyhow, um, thank you for the email.
7775360	7778720	I don't see anyone in the green room, but I do see a question.
7779040	7782040	Um, but dark soccer, you need to go AFK.
7782840	7783800	Yeah, just for a second.
7784040	7784480	Okay.
7784720	7785280	All right, go ahead.
7785280	7785760	What's the question?
7785800	7786320	Quick question.
7786320	7786600	Okay.
7786600	7790240	This came in from Bobby Black Wolf who asks, when is your weird
7790240	7791720	owl limited edition arriving?
7791760	7794080	Are you in the October batch or the 2023 batch?
7794920	7795720	Oh, good Lord.
7795760	7798400	Um, I think we're in the 2023 batch.
7799440	7800720	I'll have to ask Dan real quick.
7800840	7803240	Um, but I think we made it into the sec.
7803280	7804080	I don't know though.
7804080	7809560	Like they, like we got our pre-order and then they like didn't record it, but Dan
7809560	7814680	called the company and they got our pre-order in, so I think we're in the
7814680	7819440	later batch, which makes me sad inside of my heart region, but good things
7819440	7820400	come to those who wait, right?
7821840	7822960	No, it needs to happen now.
7823320	7823720	All right.
7823920	7827480	And yes, dark soccer did order that weird out table that she talked about last week
7827480	7829120	on the show as we all knew she would.
7829120	7832480	So it's been 13 grand, been very pinball heavy here at VOG network.
7832480	7835440	Cause if you listen to Bobby Black Wolf, which I encourage you all to do, he
7835440	7839440	talked to last week about his new rush table, uh, that he got and putting that
7839440	7840000	together.
7840000	7842480	So I'm looking forward to playing that Labor Day weekend when I go out to
7842480	7848320	Atlanta, uh, assuming, but, um, uh, doesn't fuck up, fuck us all up.
7848640	7849040	What's that?
7849440	7853280	You have three weeks left to play Elvira over at my place.
7853600	7855040	Oh no, it's leaving.
7855840	7856960	Yeah, we're giving it back.
7856960	7860160	Um, so if you want to come play Elvira, come play it.
7860160	7863840	We're so we're, we, I think we have, uh, we're selling Mandalorian.
7865360	7865840	Uh huh.
7866240	7872480	And, um, I think what's the, uh, I think we're selling my shows in three
7872480	7876320	weeks, but I'll, I'll try to make it work because I still, I still have, um, the
7876320	7879280	stuff that Loki gave me to give to you, like sitting in a box.
7879360	7881280	Cause we had to move it to this house.
7881280	7886480	So I think we're, I think we're selling, um, Oh gosh, not ACD stuff.
7887120	7891840	Um, one of those other like heavy metal band ones, mega death or whatever.
7891840	7892640	Not mega death.
7894320	7896000	I can't think of it off the top of my head.
7896000	7898080	Like I can see the logo and not Slayer.
7898080	7900240	I know they didn't do a Slayer one, but it was like in that.
7901920	7904240	No, I'll have to look, but we're selling one.
7904240	7907040	Um, I remember the machine, not Metallica.
7907040	7909040	It's another not Metallica.
7909040	7912720	Yeah, we don't, I don't think we have Metallica anymore, but, uh, we're
7912720	7914400	definitely holding on to Ghostbusters.
7914400	7915600	So that's good.
7915600	7916240	Iron maiden.
7916960	7917440	Iron maiden.
7917440	7918720	That's the one we're selling iron maiden.
7919520	7919760	Yep.
7920480	7921200	All right.
7921200	7924640	Uh, comments and chat pod culture says voice of pinball network.
7924640	7925040	Yes.
7925040	7931440	Sometimes, Hey, we, you all have pointed out my office has a nice space next to,
7931440	7934320	um, you know, burger time there that something could go.
7934320	7938240	I think we can lend you a table if you want.
7939120	7943120	No getting a table upstairs would be the biggest pain in the.
7943120	7943840	Oh yes.
7943840	7944800	I know this very well.
7945600	7949440	I, I, I do think that one of two things is going to happen.
7949440	7953120	The Tron machine is going to, I'm going to get that or the, um, Namco
7953120	7955280	celebration one, cause I want a super pack manager.
7955920	7958960	Um, but they, I think these will actually, oops, sorry.
7958960	7962480	I think these will actually move into the walk-in closet and I'll
7962480	7964240	have a walk-in arcade essentially.
7964800	7968400	So, well, you could still, I mean, you've got a garage.
7970400	7971920	We have to park cars in it.
7972560	7973600	Part of our HOA.
7973600	7974080	Yeah.
7974080	7976080	So screw HOA.
7976080	7979120	I know, but it would make sense.
7979120	7980720	I explained to you off air.
7980720	7981840	You kind of have to have one.
7983440	7986400	Well, I'm, I'm sure it goes with any new community.
7986400	7987040	Yeah, it does.
7988240	7988880	All right.
7988880	7994720	Um, as 200 Matt says, pin cast channel reward episode win.
7994720	7996080	Actually you bring up a great point.
7996640	8001360	We have owed this community for three or four months, orange lounge foodie-o.
8001360	8003920	So the three of us, the three of us need to get our heads together.
8003920	8007200	And I think you all understand why, and thank you for being gracious and
8007200	8011200	understanding why, um, mentally I was not in a place where I could do it.
8011840	8012160	Right.
8012160	8013840	Well, you know, it was just badly timed.
8014400	8016960	Um, I'm in a much better place now with all that.
8016960	8020160	So I'm, I'm happy to do the foodie-o episode and I don't even, I don't
8020160	8021200	need a guest host or anything.
8021200	8022240	I mean, I'll do it.
8022240	8022880	It's cool.
8022880	8023840	I'll do it.
8023840	8024080	Shit.
8024080	8024480	Yeah.
8024480	8026000	So we just need to set a date.
8026000	8030880	So, um, and then once we get that out of the way, well, I say it like it's a,
8030880	8035840	once we finally deliver on that promise because things got held up much better
8035840	8040160	way of phrasing it, then we can open up the rewards again to these other fun
8040160	8041120	ideas you guys have.
8042160	8043680	Um, and I, I know we want to do that.
8043680	8045360	We're kind of, kind of backlogged on that right now.
8045360	8049680	So, uh, I will talk to my co-host off air to try to set a date for, um, orange
8049680	8050960	lounge foodie-o.
8050960	8057760	Speaking of dates, um, by the way, I will not be here on the, uh, on April
8057760	8063440	17th for, I will be, uh, actually probably in LA at that point.
8063440	8065200	Um, eating at Roscoe's.
8065920	8067920	I'm going to Disneyland for my birthday.
8067920	8068720	I love that.
8068720	8069280	Love that for you.
8069280	8069920	You can't stop me.
8070560	8071360	Are you going to see?
8071360	8074480	And this is a big step for me because I haven't wanted to be around like people
8074480	8075440	in groups at all.
8076080	8078400	Um, and hopefully Tiara will be able to meet me.
8078400	8079760	I have invited them.
8079760	8081600	I haven't seen them in forever.
8081600	8082000	That's right.
8082000	8083120	They live in Vegas now, right?
8083680	8084800	You want to come for my birthday?
8085440	8092240	I wish, but you can still talk to so-and-so.
8092240	8093520	I'm going to table that question.
8094320	8095920	I'm not going to say no, I'm going to table it.
8097120	8100160	Outlook unlikely, but I kind of want to try.
8101200	8101700	Okay.
8102320	8102800	All right.
8102800	8105280	It certainly would make affording a hotel easier.
8106320	8106960	That's yeah.
8107920	8110080	But I tried to get Blue Bayou and they're booked.
8110720	8112160	They're like nothing good.
8113120	8115840	And I'm going to be doing just Disneyland in the afternoon.
8115840	8116720	Do lunch at Carthay.
8117840	8118640	I can't.
8118640	8121040	Um, well, no, actually I could do lunch.
8121040	8122000	No, Carthay was booked.
8122560	8125280	There were only like a handful of places that had any openings.
8126240	8128560	So it'd have to like be put on a list to go eat there.
8129280	8133200	Have you talked to our gal pal Victoria about Aria snark?
8133200	8133600	I haven't yet.
8133600	8135360	I haven't talked to Victoria in months.
8136000	8137040	Oh, okay.
8137600	8138560	Would you talk to Victoria?
8139760	8141680	Well, I mean, she's just an expert.
8142160	8145120	Yeah, no, um, I'm going through the Disney dining booking online.
8145760	8149440	Uh, I don't think there's any secret tricks or anything with that.
8149440	8150960	I think there's, yeah, no, there's not.
8151760	8154240	I mean, there's also calling and saying it's my birthday.
8154240	8155760	I want to eat there, do it.
8155760	8156800	And then crying.
8156800	8157520	And that might happen.
8158080	8162080	Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I'm trying to figure out how I would get enough equipment
8162080	8164800	into my arcade to be able to stream from there.
8164800	8168160	I'd have to almost dismantle my existing setup completely.
8168160	8169120	Well, here's okay.
8169120	8175040	So Bobby, actually, if you really wanted to do that, I have a studio that's meant to be
8175040	8175520	portable.
8176400	8177760	That's now in a box.
8177760	8178480	It's not.
8178480	8183600	So, so the Mac mini that used to broadcast this show, it's not in the loop anymore because
8183600	8187360	it didn't make sense for this virtual environment for me to just pass it to another computer.
8187360	8192880	But I still have it because there's going to come a day where once again, OLR will broadcast
8192880	8195680	from an expo somewhere and we can do it.
8195680	8198080	So I, Oh, it's the lights and the mics.
8198080	8198720	I see.
8198720	8200400	Oh, I have some of that.
8200400	8202080	I have the mixing board and all that, but you're right.
8202080	8204560	That would get, would get a little crunchy on the space.
8204560	8209920	But if, if we could do, okay, so you have to think back to when there was a Sacramento
8209920	8212400	IGDA, which there is, that doesn't even exist anymore.
8212400	8214160	It's Sacramento gamers collective now.
8214160	8220720	But when we did the IGDA expo, you remember those shows is about 2014, 2015, somewhere
8220720	8220960	in there.
8221680	8227200	Um, we did, uh, that show at the, what the fuck was it called?
8227200	8230640	The colony right next to the colonial theater where I do all these other shows.
8231280	8231440	Yeah.
8231440	8232240	I remember that.
8232240	8237200	If we could broadcast a show from there, we could broadcast a show from your, your basement.
8238960	8242400	That place was not a nice, Hey, I'm glad they had it.
8242400	8243840	I'm glad they got to do a thing, but you're right.
8243840	8247120	It was a very itty bitty space, but that's why the next, the next year they did it at
8247120	8250640	the West Sacramento convention space, which was much better, much better space.
8251760	8254480	Uh, GTRama S says, where did I get that gaming chair?
8254480	8255360	It looks nice.
8255360	8255760	Thank you.
8255760	8256960	I think it's just Amazon.
8257760	8264080	Um, and I say, I think because it was Alan's gaming chair and then he had the same brand.
8264080	8264800	He bought me.
8264800	8266720	No, we did.
8266720	8267280	Okay.
8267280	8270400	Um, I got this one on, um, Nick's recommendation.
8271360	8276560	He bought me a green chair for my birthday Christmas.
8276560	8281840	No, he bought me a green chair for Christmas, but the problem was green screening with it.
8281840	8284000	No, it wasn't the green screen that I could deal with.
8284000	8290160	The bottom was shaped like this, but literally my butt was too big for the chair because
8290160	8295200	when I would sit in the chair, the sides would like dig into my fat fucking ass.
8295200	8298000	So I couldn't like sit comfortably in that chair.
8298000	8303040	The ironic thing is I've now lost almost 40 pounds since then.
8303040	8307440	And so it probably wouldn't be a problem anymore, but Alan and I have already switched chairs.
8307440	8308560	So I can't.
8308560	8310960	Yeah, it is what it is.
8311920	8316080	Um, as the show 100 Matt is suggesting for dark soccer, there's a third party Disney
8316080	8320560	dining app that gets all the appointment booking data and pings you and slots open up for times.
8321360	8321860	Hmm.
8324240	8329120	I, oh, I know mouse weight had something kind of like that, but
8330400	8334960	I'm just, I'm just, you know, I'm happy that, that I'm going to be able to go.
8334960	8339200	But yeah, it's been, it's been a while cause of the pan panini.
8339200	8339760	Yeah.
8339840	8346400	I went, I went, um, Memorial day, the day after Memorial day in 2019, right after drag con.
8347520	8349040	Well, you know, I'm never going to again.
8349920	8354640	I heard, yeah, we went between Delta and Omicron.
8354640	8356880	So when it was like, oh, things are getting better.
8356880	8357600	And then it was site.
8357600	8359920	Well, we went right in between those and we had a good time.
8360560	8362800	Do you have to get tickets for galaxy's edge anymore?
8364160	8366240	I believe yes for that one.
8366240	8366480	Yes.
8366480	8369040	But not the Spiderman ride.
8369040	8369680	Fucking Nathan.
8369680	8370640	I have to worry about that too.
8370640	8371360	Don't quote me on that.
8371360	8372720	Well, you can't get them until the day off.
8372720	8374480	You just have to wake up early and do it.
8374480	8376080	That part Victoria is good at.
8379120	8379620	All right.
8380160	8384160	I'm going to have to double check the stuff behind that, but at any rate, yeah.
8384800	8385360	All right.
8385360	8389680	I think with all that we are, uh, to the end of our show for tonight.
8389680	8391200	Thank you all so much for listening.
8391200	8391680	Of course.
8391680	8396240	Uh, hopefully the sounds getting better as we get used to this new and improved setup
8396240	8397120	and there's more to come.
8397120	8398960	I still have so much I want to build in this room.
8399520	8400880	It's just going to expand.
8400880	8405040	I want to thank everybody for tuning in tonight, whether you were here live with us on Twitch
8405040	8407120	or you were tuned into the podcast feed.

8413760	8415760	it be gaming, uh, getting ready for St.
8415760	8419440	Patrick's day, which I guess is in two weeks, uh, or whatever, whatever it is you're doing.
8419440	8421040	I hope you all are having a wonderful week.
8421040	8423760	Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, tell a friend or two
8423760	8424560	about the show.
8424560	8427760	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we
8427760	8428800	need more voices here.
8428800	8431360	Participating with our show, a nice five star review.
8431360	8435360	Wherever you found this show, iTunes, Spotify, Google podcasts, wherever it is, you found
8435360	8435920	the show.
8435920	8439200	A nice five star review goes an awful long way as well.
8439200	8444640	Um, don't forget to join our discord vog at network.com slash discord and continue the
8444640	8449120	conversation throughout the week with our friends and our podcast family and everybody
8449120	8452880	there, um, participating along with that.
8452880	8453840	We will wrap it up.
8453840	8458240	I believe dark soccer as usual is, uh, going to her post-show killing spree.
8458240	8460640	Uh, so I will let you go first with your final thought.
8461840	8465360	Um, um, words, things.
8466560	8466800	Yeah.
8468320	8469040	All right.
8469040	8470640	And on that note, have a great stream.
8473200	8473760	All right.
8473760	8475680	And, uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.
8476480	8480640	I get my new computer tomorrow or hopefully it's been fixed.
8480640	8481760	Well, it was fixed.
8481760	8489840	Um, ended up being some cables disconnected and apparently hooked up incorrectly somehow.
8490640	8493280	So the repair shop was able to take care of it though.
8494160	8498240	Um, Alan and I are getting some money back from the house on something we overpaid on.
8498240	8500880	So we're looking at maybe money in our computer.
8500880	8502640	So that'll be very nice.
8502640	8504480	I'm ready for an upgrade though.
8504480	8506720	And now those things will directly benefit OLR as well.
8508240	8508740	All right.
8509300	8511700	Um, that is it.
8511700	8512580	My final thought.
8512580	8517460	I don't have a lot, just, you know, the, the work is never done here with unpacking.
8517460	8519940	Um, but also just a lot more exciting stuff to come.
8519940	8523540	I'm really hoping maybe in the next week, Alan and I can stream together because that's
8523540	8526820	something we've been promising for a while is the two of us streaming at the same time.
8526820	8530180	Now that we're no longer in the same room and we have the bandwidth for it, it's possible.
8530180	8530900	So that's exciting.
8531540	8532340	Frost.
8532340	8537620	Um, I'll just shout out my social media, twitter.com slash M R Rob Roberts, Mr.
8537620	8538580	Rob Roberts.
8538580	8541620	Um, also on Twitch at just Rob Roberts.
