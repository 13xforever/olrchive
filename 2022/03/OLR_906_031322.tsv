0	30000	Turtles on the Super Nest, Turtles on the Game Boy, Turtles on Genesis. When Turtles get re-released, you can play Turtles every time. Four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games I've played, nine that I haven't. If you look at the list of titles on the Cowabunga Collection, you have a 50-50 chance of guessing 33% or 66% correctly. Cowabunga. These are the Heroes in a Half Shell, now it's time to play.
30000	60000	It's time for your fully human hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
60000	90000	Hi, how are you? I'm all right. I hate time-changing, stupid, shenanigans, bullshit. See, I'm in a quandary. I'm in a conundrum when it comes to daylight savings because I love daylight savings.
90000	120000	I love when it's light out until like eight o'clock at night. I love that because I can go out walking and stay out a long time. I hate the spring forward part because I just want to stay- You can walk in the dark. Because unlike people like me, you won't be in as big of a danger of being jumped in the middle of the park. Animals don't care about any of that. So that's what I'm afraid of. I've literally seen coyotes out by the river.
120000	150000	One of my friends pointed out in her podcast that when they do advice for runners, for guys, it's stay hydrated, bring music. For women, it's how to avoid getting jumped.
150000	158720	I like it dark outside. I like- Then stay up late. This brightness is bad for my head.
159760	165440	Also, Joe, you have to stay hydrated because those women give chase and it can be very strenuous.
165440	171680	That is really actually not funny. Stop it. Techmaster Loki, trying to be funny. All right.
171680	176160	Brian, but it's un-succeeding as usual. All right. Well, let's talk about something actually
176160	179040	awesome, and that is the game playing behind you tonight. What is that?
179600	181040	Freaking love that game. It's Loom.
181040	184560	That's right. It's Loom. It's one of my favorite games ever.
184560	188960	What made you decide to do Loom tonight? I don't know. I couldn't think of what I was
188960	195920	going to do, and I've done Monkey Island and Sam and Max, so I figured Loom would be appropriate.
195920	199040	Okay. I like that. We'll have to get Indiana Jones in there at some point.
200000	207360	And yes, behind me on my machine over here in the corner, correct in chat, YYR. Hi,
207360	211440	YYR is in chat tonight because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,
211440	215920	nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network,
215920	220880	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And YYR says, I see something bad in your background
220880	225760	there. Yes. So my Burger Time machine is actually like, it's basically a Data East collection
225840	230800	machine is what it is. So it also has bad dudes on it. So I decided, you know what,
230800	235280	I've had Burger Time, like every episode, let's do bad dudes. And then in future weeks,
235280	240560	we will also see Karate Champ and Caveman Ninja, which are also on, or Joe and Mac.
241360	246400	Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the president? Well, no, I'm terrible at the game.
246400	251520	I am not a bad enough dude to rescue the president. That is, that is, that is that.
251520	256800	S2100. Matt says Rob is a bad enough dude to stay awake after an exhausting week. Yeah. Okay.
256800	261680	Let me address this because I've been talking about it on my socials. Yes, I got to do a dream
261680	267360	show hosting last night, a bucket list thing. We had John Waters in town, and I got to introduce
267360	272240	him as he did his speaking show. And we did a really kick ass drag show after so much talent
272240	277200	that was on stage. And my understanding is John Waters actually stayed for the vast majority of
277200	280960	the drag show and watched it. Uh, and I do know he went down and introduced himself to
280960	285040	the drag performance. He was, he was great. He was such a nice guy. Um, the Queens that were there,
285680	290720	uh, my favorite name, Diana hole is my favorite name that was there. Uh,
290720	294080	I was wondering if any of my friends were there like Apple or mercury.
294720	301680	Uh, no, I think mercury is doing an upcoming show. Maybe. I don't know. But, um, uh, you know,
301680	308560	Don Davenport, uh, drag King. So obviously Don Davenport had to do the John water show.
308560	314400	Of course. I don't know if, you know, um, Queens specifically were Diana whole Bijou Bentley and
314400	320480	Chris front. And then obviously we have nine non-binary red for filth, Gabby. Uh, you know,
320480	325280	so we had, we have, you know, all sorts of people. I know I'm sad. I didn't get to go, but
325280	329840	I had to work. Yeah. I understand. I understand. Uh, some video, some video is getting out,
329840	332880	not at the John waters. That's strictly prohibited, but the, uh, drag performance,
332880	336640	uh, there was definitely some shocking stuff and it was, it was, uh, what you would expect
336640	342000	it to John water strike your local Queens. Yeah, absolutely. Um, and my other thing with that is
342000	346320	that even though I know I'm, I'm in radio mode now and I'm being very outgoing, um,
347200	352400	and the, so I've been posting nice photos on social media. Here's the part you don't see
353600	359520	the part where I had to park in the hotel parking garage at the hotel John waters was staying at.
360240	366720	And take five boxes of books with 20 books each over to the lobby. So he could sign them
366720	371760	and then take them back to my car. Um, so my back is in so much pain today. Cause the,
371760	376960	yes, I was given a dolly, but the dolly, the dolly was garbage. Like it just, it was easier
376960	383760	for me to pick it up and carry them. Um, so, and then obviously me going, running up and downstairs
383760	387040	all around the theater, like that's the part you don't see the pictures of.
387600	392320	So I wake up this morning and I, well, actually I don't wake up this morning.
392320	398080	I don't sleep last night at all. And I think it's because I ate crap for dinner because nothing was
398080	402080	open. So I was like, you know what, I'll go to Jack in the box. Yeah, I'm diabetic, but like,
402080	406800	I'll just like not have sauce with the nuggets. And I'll only eat half the fries,
406800	411280	which is still about 40, 50 carbs, which is within my budget, but it's still like,
411280	414480	it's just not good food to be eating, especially that late at night, especially when I've been
414480	419440	eating pretty decently lately. Um, so I think a combination of all those things, I could not
419440	424400	sleep. I could not sleep. And then of course, what else happens last night? Daylight savings
425040	431120	could not sleep. So I'm supposed to get up at, um, eight 30 this morning because I have a dress
431120	438400	rehearsal for clue at 11 today. I called out, I messaged the director. I said, I'm so sorry.
439120	442880	I can't get out of bed. Like I physically can't get out of bed right now. And it's like,
442880	449040	I hate breaking commitments. I hate it. But it's one of those things where I have to step back and
449040	454880	realize what is, what is the greater sin calling out? Because I do feel like I have a legitimate
454880	462960	reason or showing up and being fucking miserable for three hours because I didn't sleep and I'm in
462960	467600	my forties. What is, what is actually going to end up being worth? It's going to be me there,
467600	474400	not wanting to be there in, in full, um, full drag. I'll just say it in full drag for the
474400	480320	role that I'm doing. You may notice I don't have a beard right now. I will just say that. And, um,
481840	487600	yeah. So, um, I felt really horrible about that. And honestly, I'm still really tired. I'm just
487600	493120	pushing through the show tonight for y'all. Um, but, um, yeah, I'm ready. I cannot wait
493840	499040	to go to bed early tonight and tonight I'm going to take a melatonin to make sure I fall asleep.
500400	505280	All right. Anyway, you just described like my entire condition.
506240	511120	I, you know, what's funny is that I was like, what? Cause I've, I've heard of the whole,
511120	517200	like, if you have like a vitamin D deficiency or is it B 12 or D I can't remember, but I was
517200	520960	can do it. Honestly, earlier today, I was like, I need to take a multivitamin.
520960	524960	Cause I was like, maybe, maybe it'll help. Maybe it'll. And I, I feel,
524960	531600	I certainly feel better than I did this morning. So I, I will tell anybody who though is dealing
531600	536960	with at least chronic fatigue, like, like I have to deal with, get your blood tested.
536960	542880	If you find that you've got a fatigue lasting for longer than a week, get your stuff tested,
542880	546720	test your vitamin levels, test your parathyroid, test your thyroid, test your pituitary.
547120	552480	Okay. If you can go to an endocrinologist and I'm just saying I'm not, I'm just bouncing off
552480	557840	of what you're saying. Cause I know yours is just situational, but for anybody who has ongoing
557840	562320	fatigue, see your doctor. Well, and also, you know, I also have the diet and I've been very
562320	566960	open about the diabetes thing. And even though my blood sugar is super under control, it does
566960	571840	lead to, you know, can, can have some issues there, especially after eating like shit. So,
571840	578480	you know, all right. Anyhow, I know it's a video game show and not a Rob Vince about his problem
578480	583760	show, but sometimes it's both. So let's get into some actual gaming news. Some big gaming news.
583760	588640	We had a surprise PlayStation state of play this week. We got quite a bit of news out of it.
588640	591600	Loki, why don't I go to you to help us recap the PlayStation.
593200	598960	So yeah, state of play, lots of announcements. So they had a bunch of different trailers.
599440	605200	Um, some of these we've kind of seen some things before some we haven't like, um, I don't remember
605200	611440	if we've seen the deal field Chronicle, but apparently it's, um, kind of, uh, almost like
611440	615840	a cross between like final fantasy tactics or fire emblem or something like that. But it's a game,
615840	622960	it looks like from square Enix, uh, the Valkyrie Elysium, uh, which is a new Valkyrie profile game.
622960	627360	A lot of people psyched about that. That's for sure. A lot of people, I mean, that's,
627360	631040	that series has been asleep for a little while. So that's pretty exciting.
632400	635520	Uh, there's a game that looks like it'd be something that I might be interested in
635520	640240	XO primal. It's they're saying it's like a cross between those like Overwatch and earth
640240	644800	defense force. All you have to say it's a cross of earth defense force and I'll check it out. But
644800	652000	like, um, that's something that's coming from Capcom. Um, what else can I just say the chat
652000	657360	really commenting on that because, uh, orange is saying, I saw a lot of OMG Dino crisis. Oh,
657360	662160	wait, it's not Dino crisis. And as she went on her mat says the not Dino crisis game.
664560	670800	It's like, uh, you know, lost, lost planet and Dino crisis mixed together or something like that.
670800	674400	Maybe, maybe that's what they plan to do with rival schools. After all these years,
674400	678560	you're going to get fighting colleges, fighting colleges.
678640	683680	I think that's the new saints row game, but you know,
685680	691040	um, quest buster and chat says a streamer I was watching during the announcement was freaking out
691040	696560	thinking it was Dino crisis at first. And then was utterly confused when it showed more, um,
696560	701280	Bobby Blackwell, the chat says you were expecting final fantasy tactics, but it was I
701280	705280	dial field Chronicles. Yeah. It's just, I feel like there were a couple of those announcements
705280	710960	where it was like, we're bringing this back. I mean, where, where was the, um, space shoot
710960	715680	them up meets Zelda overworld Explorer. And then, Oh no, it's not the guardian legend. It's,
715680	718960	it's this, I mean, where was that? Just, just to fuck with us further.
722320	728720	They had a returnal Ascension, which is adding a co-op mode to returnal and a new area. So
728720	734400	there's a teaser for that on yet another trailer for ghost wire Tokyo, which is supposed to be
734400	740080	coming out here pretty soon, like in the next week or two. Yeah, it looked interesting. I'm
740080	747440	curious to hear more about that. Uh, for spoken had a new trailer. So, you know, it shows some
747440	752480	of the gameplay this time. Uh, and then of course we got another trailer for strangers of paradise,
752480	761680	final fantasy origin, which it's something it's unique, which apparently has a new demo,
761680	765440	but I don't think they're putting any of the demos on series X because I've been looking
765440	770160	for them and I can't find them. Well, the game's not coming out on PlayStation. I think it says
770160	775440	it's only a PlayStation four and five. I thought, well, it's of course, it's going to say that in
775440	781280	the state of play, but I'm pretty sure that's not necessarily true because on, uh, the, not
781280	787520	dental crosses, not Dino crisis game. It says it's coming to PlayStation four or five X-Box series,
787680	792720	X and S X-Box one and PC in 2023. Sure. That strangers of paradise was an Xbox.
793600	798720	It could be, let's see here. It says it is. Oh yeah. But for whatever reason,
798720	802560	you're just not putting the demos out on series X, which, you know, I get it. PlayStation,
802560	807920	it's that PlayStation exclusive got to get those exclusive demos that it is what it is
808480	814880	exclusive demo for final fantasy origins and the FESTA, you know, so it's, it's about the same,
814880	824000	right? It evens out. Um, what else? So we've also got, um, there was a trailer for Gundam evolution,
824880	831120	which is interesting. That's a free to play shooter game. Um, this massive TMNT,
831120	837040	the cowabunga collection, a lot of our audience talking about, I didn't realize there were so many
837600	844080	Ninja turtle games actually. Right. Uh, yeah. Well, it's, it's also weird too, because like,
844080	849360	um, you know, there's, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game, obviously. And then
849360	852560	there's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles two, the arcade game. So it's like, you can play the
852560	856480	arcade version or you can play the NES version. Okay. So here's the thing, here's it before,
856480	860000	before chat lights up. Cause I know, I know they're fast and furious typing because I got
860000	864800	called out on this on discord too, because I said that in chat, I was like, why? I mean, it, it's
864800	870560	nice for completionist reasons that we get the nest TMNT to the arcade game. But why would you
870560	875200	choose to play that when the actual arcade game is there other than the completionist,
875200	880960	this is my childhood memory and all that stuff. And then I was reminded there were bonus levels
880960	886480	in the NES version. I completely forgot about that. Um, but you know what you don't have the
886480	893360	voice acting tonight. I die in on turtle soup. Like you don't have any of that in the NES version.
893360	898640	So I just, I do want to, I do want to point that out. There are things missing from the NES
898640	903360	version that I think are pretty awesome. So yeah, so basically you have a lot of different games,
903360	911440	so 13 games. Uh, so the arcade game, you've got turtles in time, uh, the, the Ninja Turtles NES
911440	918480	game, which is super hard, uh, you know, nitro's to the arcade, um, turtles three, the Manhattan
918480	924000	project, uh, tournament fighters for the NES. I didn't remember that being on the NES. I thought
924000	929840	that was on super Nintendo, um, turtles in time. I think it was right in that era where they were
929840	934640	still making NES games and probably they were getting bought more in other regions than just
934640	941760	North America. Um, I remember trying to fighters on most people in Genesis game. Yeah. Because they
941760	946720	had that blockbuster challenge thing while back with NBA jam and turtles and the tournament
946720	952320	fighters that you had to do. So I remember playing that that's right. Um, so they had the
952320	959440	tournament fires on super Nintendo and Genesis, uh, the hyper stone heist on the Genesis. Uh,
959440	964880	then I think I mentioned turtles in time, uh, fall, the foot clan from game boy, um,
964880	969920	nitro's to back from the sewers and turtles three radical rescue all on the game boy.
971360	976400	So that's, uh, quite the collections coming out later this year. Yes, it is.
976400	981360	I think, I feel like it's missing something. Didn't they do a reboot on Xbox three 60?
981360	986800	Like, uh, they did arcade game inspired game. Yeah. I mean, that's probably, it's probably
986800	990480	too late. Like I know, I, I know it was on three 60 arcade. Well, there's the new one
990480	994320	that's coming out too. That's not out yet. Yeah, of course that's not going to be in it, but, um,
995440	1001920	yeah. Turtles in time reshelved. Was that what it was? Hmm. Um, anyway, but, um,
1002880	1007280	still, I mean, basically what this is, it's the Castlevania collection.
1007920	1010720	It's the contract was, was there a contract collection? It was a contract collection,
1010720	1015680	right there, the classic economy arcade collection. It's it's that, but now with
1015680	1021200	Ninja turtles, but I think a lot of people are surprised because this one feels a lot more
1021200	1025760	complete because the Castlevania collection was missing stuff, right? Hence why we got the
1025760	1031120	Castlevania advanced collection. And I still feel like there's hella Castlevania games were missing.
1031120	1037280	Um, so if, but I can also understand if you're going to have to go through the hassle of getting
1037280	1043360	the licenses of the Ninja turtles, you know, cause this has to be a partnership who owns the
1043360	1048960	Nickelodeon has the rights now. Oh, parents, that umbrella bait. Well, that's part of paramount.
1048960	1053840	Yeah. So they have to get the license there. And then I guess EA probably doesn't have license
1053840	1057360	rights anymore. Right. Cause they did at one point. Cause I remember that was the Xbox three
1057360	1064160	60. They had to go through that. Um, so this feels very complete and I think it's because
1064160	1068880	of the licensing and the fact that they're only going to do it once. You know what I mean? So,
1068880	1072640	yeah, but that's exciting. I guess this is Konami's business now.
1073520	1079840	Just milk in the retro games and collections. I don't hate it. You know, I'm, I'm still very
1079840	1085760	much like, why wouldn't you just like fucking, well, no, I don't want them doing a new game.
1085760	1089920	I want them selling the IP to someone who could do it justice. Like why won't you sell the silent
1089920	1095520	hill IP to somebody else? They tried new games with like, what was it? That soccer game that
1095520	1101520	they just put out in the middle here, right? Or no, the metal game, Contra game and the Contra
1101520	1108160	games. Those that's three for three for sucking. So it's like, yeah, maybe, maybe don't try anymore.
1110000	1114320	But they can make good partnerships. Uh, because that's all this, these are good partnerships
1114960	1122160	is what these collections are. So, um, yeah. Uh, what else? Uh, they had a trailer for Gigabash,
1122160	1127840	which looks like War of the Monsters, um, Jojo Bazaar's Adventure All-Star Battle R.
1129680	1137360	So it's, uh, I think it's a re-release maybe or remaster or something like that. And then a
1137360	1143760	new trailer for truck to Yuma or Yomi, truck to Yomi. That's a lot of stuff for 20 minutes.
1143760	1147920	That's pretty impressive. I have to admit, I wasn't able to watch it live. I had to kind of
1147920	1152960	get the recap and the wrap ups just because I had a work meeting at the time, uh, cause it was two
1152960	1158160	o'clock Pacific. So there was no way I could watch it live, but, um, yeah, I thought it was, uh,
1158160	1163520	pretty action packed. Um, there are two to you and chat says for the record, I liked Rogue Corps,
1163520	1167840	but, and that's talking about the Contra game, but it had its issue. Sure. Um, you know, and,
1167840	1173360	and to be fair, you know, Loki did mention a three for three Konami suck fest there.
1174960	1178960	If we take the popular opinion, you know, there's always going to be somebody that sticks up for
1179680	1184080	the bad stuff. I get it. But if you go a little further back, just a little further back,
1184080	1189520	there was that bomber man game that released on the switch. And then that was, it wasn't,
1189520	1194240	it was good. It was good. It wasn't like OMG, but it was, it was good. And they,
1194240	1199520	they did a lot of crossover characters with it. It was cute. So, you know, okay. Yes. Konami,
1199520	1203040	at least in the last decade has made one decent game.
1205040	1209280	What? Well, there was, I thought there was another, so there was that one Contra game
1209280	1212560	and I thought they did like another Contra game as well. That was like more of a side
1212560	1218480	scroller, but I think that was like a mobile game. Yeah. Mobile or the collection. You're
1218480	1222640	probably just thinking of the mobile game was better than, well, it was better than the switch
1222640	1228720	game. That's for sure. Okay. Orangewrite does say they did a mobile game. And there were other
1228720	1234400	Ninja turtle games that apparently were missing because I saw some screenshots of some from the DS
1234400	1241360	and Game Boy advance that are not part of that collection. So it's incomplete still.
1243280	1249760	Got it. Sorry. I'm I'm learning. Yeah. Some of the folks that are watching live are like,
1249760	1255120	it's recursive. OLR. Yeah. I don't know how to fix that yet. I'll figure it out. I just have to
1255120	1259840	hide my own output on discord. I'm sure there's a way to do it, but yeah, when, when dark soccer
1259840	1264640	turns off her camera, it puts her in the lowest position on discord. So which, you know, people
1264640	1270320	are allowed to get away and use the potty and whatever they do. But then it shows instead the
1270880	1276400	output that my co-hosts are seeing so they can watch the show. So I'll just, I'll just turn that
1276400	1284160	off. We should have recursive, OLR. Yeah. It'll just go into like a void. It'll just be forever.
1285040	1292000	Forever. YYR does want to point out in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network.
1292000	1296880	Don't forget Konami has continued producing Bahmani all this time, and it's still good.
1296880	1301680	Actually, they just launched a new Bahmani game in Japan. I'll give you that. And they've been
1301680	1306720	doing the PC subscription things, which I don't like the model, but people have been buying into
1306720	1313280	it and they seem to enjoy it. So good for them. Um, I feel like even though I know this might not
1313280	1319680	be true anymore, I know Konami has re-orged since the nineties, but in my heart, in my brain,
1320320	1326480	I still feel like there's the Konami there's case set. Konami, what is it? Computer entertainment,
1326480	1333520	Tokyo that did the home games. And then there's Konami arcade that does the arcade machines.
1333520	1337760	And I guess that would be tied to like pachinko and slots and all that is the same.
1338320	1343680	I don't know in my head. It is whether I'm right or wrong, just roll with me here. And in my brain,
1345120	1350000	we don't have case set anymore. Cause it's not fair for me to say case set is a flop because
1350000	1354960	we don't have that anymore. But like the, the, the space that that used to fill
1356000	1361040	is kind of a flop the arcade side of the house doing just fine.
1362560	1368800	So that's that my, like my brain is like, there are two Konami's one is bad. The other is bad.
1368800	1373520	Konami is bad. No, I'm just kidding. It's but it's, what is bad? The other is, is pretty decent.
1373520	1377360	So, you know, it's, it's, it's weird in my brain though. Oh, hi.
1379200	1381280	Guest appearance by Alan who brought me Starbucks.
1383120	1386640	Come say to the mic. You can't come say to the mic. Alan. Alan has a joke. Y'all
1386640	1390960	inside of everyone. There are really close inside of everyone. There are two Konami's.
1398800	1402240	All right. Thank you. A random Alan appearance on this lovely evening.
1402240	1405440	Well, if it's Jack in the box, it's going to be the shit Konami, I guess.
1406080	1412880	Can we not talk about that? All right. Anyhow. Let's was that it for PlayStation
1412880	1417600	state of play? Did we miss anything? That was it? Yep. Okay. Let's move on then. So
1418560	1421840	as has been a recurring theme for the last couple of weeks here on the show,
1422640	1426880	there's a lot of stuff going on in the real world, obviously, and it's continuing to go on in the
1426880	1433120	real world as much as we wish. Vladimir Putin would end this unnecessary invasion that he is
1433120	1439600	doing. The gaming, the end, a lot of you again might ask, what does this have to do with gaming?
1440160	1445600	Well, we have some answers for you. Gaming industry continues to respond. Right, Loki?
1446640	1451760	Yeah, so I think this is just following the sanctions that we that are on the country,
1451760	1457440	but lots of different game companies are basically suspending business and sales in
1458320	1466400	the country. So Microsoft Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Epic Games, they have suspended sales
1466400	1473040	in those regions. They've, you know, either blocked accounts or whatever the case may be.
1473040	1478320	So Epic Games, you know, they've stopped commerce with Russia in our games in response to its
1478320	1482720	invasion of Ukraine. And we are not blocking access for the same reason other communication
1482720	1490080	tools remain online. The free world should be free and open, they said. What else? And then
1490080	1496480	we've got, of course, you know, I mean, lots of different companies are coming out. CG product
1496480	1501680	red came out against, you know, the war. I don't think there's really anyone coming out in defense
1501680	1507680	of the war. But yeah, nobody, nobody is except no one's taking that wrong take.
1507680	1514080	Yeah, nobody is except for Vladimir. Like it's this one. It's this in, especially after the last
1514080	1519600	what 10 years in politics, give or take. Yeah. It's like the one thing everyone agrees on.
1520800	1527520	Yeah, so no, no Xbox is going to Russia, unfortunately. Same with Nintendo. Nintendo
1527520	1535680	is not shipping any more Nintendo switch to Russia as well. And they are also delaying
1535680	1540640	indefinitely the advanced wars game because you know, war game during war, probably not the
1540640	1546960	greatest look. So that's what they're thinking. And that was a little different because it's not
1546960	1554000	like a Russia thing. It's a this reads really bad in context type of thing because and Bobby went a
1554000	1560880	little deeper on this topic on his show tonight. And I do remember that it like, had like a very
1560880	1566400	like Soviet Union inspired sort of thing like that part I remembered, but I did not remember
1566400	1574480	that the first game opens with literally that inspired thing invading another country. Like
1574480	1582400	that's how it starts. So it really reads in bad context. So it's not just like war bad, bad time
1582400	1592320	for it. It's like war bad and story really not good in the current context. So yeah, it's going
1592320	1598720	to be going to be a little bit before. Yeah. And then the join all three Sony has also halted
1598720	1607360	PlayStation sales in Russia do due to the invasion as well. So no Sony, no, no PlayStation, no Xbox
1607360	1612800	and no Nintendo Switch, although Nintendo Switch, I mean, who knows those shortages keep happening.
1612800	1622720	So it may just naturally not be there anyways. Yeah, so those know what no more games for them.
1622720	1629360	And then of course, along with that, we've also got Twitch is withholding payments for Russian
1629360	1634640	streamers, which kind of sucks. Because, you know, I feel like that that's more of like innocent
1634640	1641360	bystanders in this case, but it is a purpose. Yeah, it is. It's an insight the public to,
1642000	1647920	to protest and rebel. Yeah, I understand that. But But no, I get it. Like, you know,
1647920	1653360	at face value, like they, there are many people in Russia that do not agree with what's going on.
1653360	1657600	And it's and I get it from their perspective. Like it's, it's it seems kind of unfair.
1658320	1663440	At the same time, there are many, many more people in Russia that are being lied to
1664000	1670400	consistently by the media. And it's these types of things that are going to wake people up to
1670400	1677520	what's really hard because again, everybody understands this is bad. So if you if you have
1677520	1684080	all the facts, so anyway, so I just just kind of know and I get it and I get it. And it's more of
1684080	1690160	like, you know, what else are they, they have to do something. And so it makes sense. And it's not
1690160	1693920	like they're just like, we're just not going to pay you period. They're just withholding payments
1693920	1699680	for now. And, you know, and I think for a lot of the streamers that were in Russia anyways,
1699680	1704400	they knew this was coming. And it was not really a huge deal. It was more of just like,
1705280	1709040	you know, not a big surprise. Um,
1710080	1716560	one thing I also I don't know if it was on your list or not. But you also had Niantic
1716640	1722960	because I saw the comment in chat about Bobby had said, the physical stopping of products is less
1722960	1728160	about sanctions and more about how volatile shipping lanes are. They're worried about
1728160	1735280	shipments getting destroyed. And yes, I get that. But there are some other things like and one that
1735280	1741360	obviously caught my eyes because I play a lot of Niantic games is that they shut off Pokemon Go
1741360	1746960	and Ingress and I'm assuming Pikmin in Russia, they shut it off. So you can't even play the
1746960	1752320	games there. And again, sucks for the people that disagree with what's happening and are,
1752320	1757520	you know, good people that don't want any part of this, but it's to wake up a lot of other people.
1757520	1762080	I thought this was really neat. And I was trying to find it so I could show it here on the camera.
1763360	1768240	Because you know, I play a lot of Ingress, which is Niantic's other game. And I thought this was
1768240	1772720	cool. It looks like it's unfortunately fallen apart a little bit. But this is actually in
1772720	1778640	Moscow before they pulled the game. They actually did some field art that was supposed to look like
1778640	1782400	it doesn't look like it now because the portals are showing so big. But it was supposed to be a
1782400	1788080	little dove holding a peace branch. So you have to imagine like you're looking at like a constellation
1788080	1791920	I guess at this point, it actually looks like if you kind of imagine you see the wing there and
1791920	1797200	it's actually a dove holding a peace branch. And an act of protest like that is technically kind
1797200	1803200	of like against, you know, the law, I guess, if you will, that, you know, they don't enjoy many
1803200	1808960	of the same freedoms we have in the Bill of Rights here in the US. And I thought that was awesome,
1809680	1815440	that enough people that are aware of what's going on in the situation kind of got together to do
1815440	1821360	that before the plug was pulled, because now that means that stuck there. And that's an image that's
1821360	1826800	floating right over Moscow until the game gets turned back on. Well, you want to get technical
1826800	1831360	technically, if you don't recharge portals within seven days, they they decay and they
1831360	1836640	belong to no faction. My assumption is they thought that through and somebody outside of
1836640	1840880	Russia has keys to those portals to recharge them so it can stay up but I am making an assumption
1840880	1849520	there. So but I thought that was a neat act of protest. For sure. All right. Um, any any other
1850560	1855760	boycott issues going on? No, that's all that I've seen so far. I mean,
1855760	1859040	I'm sure there's a lot of other ones, but all right. You know,
1859760	1863920	well, there's another half everybody. There's another half to this. I wanted to get to dark
1863920	1867520	Sakura for but it looks like she stepped away for just a moment. Let me see if we have some other
1867520	1874000	chat comments we can get to here. Thank you. sjo 100. Matt over twitch.tv slash vogue network says
1874000	1879760	Russia has been arresting folks protesting by the thousands. Yep. Props to these folks protesting
1879760	1884960	even though there is a good chance they will get arrested. Yeah. I didn't step away for sure. Oh,
1884960	1894320	okay. I just then let's let's let's go to the other half of this. Russia is encouraging piracy.
1897680	1904400	How so that's it. They're wanting people to pirate movies, pirate games,
1904400	1911840	anything to get around it. They have unblocked rude tracker so that Russians can pirate different
1911840	1917600	films. So yeah, they're they're trying to get around everything.
1921040	1925280	Yeah, and some people I think have been kind of very tongue in cheek saying,
1926000	1931760	well, wasn't piracy kind of already a thing there anyway? You know, not until now.
1933920	1938720	I think what pirate if you know where to look piracy is a thing everywhere. Let's be real,
1938720	1946400	you know, and again, I don't endorse piracy and gaming. But I understand I have said the words
1946400	1952000	out of my mouth, that I do endorse piracy when you can't get a hold of the game through legal means.
1954160	1960000	I suppose I'm now in a bit of a quandary. Because that's kind of what these folks in Russia are
1960000	1964960	trying to do. I'm not saying I support it because obviously I don't support the war and all that.
1964960	1971520	And I want people to be aware of what is going on. But I do feel like my brain has divided by
1971520	1980720	zero a little bit. Because I'm like, I kind of like it's it's a logical thing to happen
1981360	1989200	in response to what Hollywood gaming, etc, etc has done. It's it's one of those things where it's
1989200	1997200	like, I don't like it, but I get it. Mike Defton chat says Russia is taking the do what you want
1997200	2005120	because a pirate is free auto to heart. DJ rama s host of anime co host of anime jam session also
2005120	2011920	kind of reminds us also included in boycotting Funimation crunchyroll Sony, no more anime streams,
2011920	2017120	unless I suppose they are pirating it because now the government has really no reason to
2017920	2023200	enforce trademark or any of that to enforce international copyright or trademark or any of
2023200	2029040	that. So anyway, well, who's gonna do business with that company or that country afterwards when
2029600	2035680	this all gets resolved eventually? Yeah, I like I feel like the Russian government is just setting
2035680	2040880	things further and further and further back, like just doing more and more permanent damage,
2040880	2047040	like it's already gonna take so long for things to get back to where they were. I don't even think
2047040	2051600	things can ever get back to where they were. Unless there's different people in charge,
2051600	2057200	I suppose that's that's how things get back to where they, you know, and hopefully a better
2057200	2062720	direction even, but it's gonna take a big move like that. And I don't think that's coming anytime
2062720	2067920	soon. And that's why, you know, to circle back to the gaming stuff. That's why a game like Advance
2067920	2075360	Wars, one and two. That's why they refunded all of the money. And that's why they, you know,
2075360	2081440	they don't have a new date for any of that. I think we just don't know how long this is
2081440	2087040	going to take. Wait, you're supposed to refund people money on things when you don't have a date
2087040	2097280	when something's going to be released. Looking at you, Tommy. Hey. Oof. Oof. Oof. Roblox. Oof.
2097840	2106960	Uh, but yeah, Nintendo just doesn't know when it's ever going to be safe to release the game. So
2106960	2110960	and it's going to take this ending, which could be a very, very long time
2112560	2120480	for that to be appropriate. So all right, let's move on and get to our next segment and talk a
2120480	2126080	little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of things we've been playing to take our mind off of
2126080	2130240	these horrific things in the world and so forth. DarkSakura, as usual, I'll start with you. How was
2130240	2136400	your gaming week? I've been playing Chrono Trigger and I actually had a problem yesterday where I
2136400	2141440	didn't realize until almost the end of my stream that my mic was muted because no one was talking
2141440	2149040	in my chat, but I, but Shane came by. Oh, cool. And we chatted for a bit and some random person
2149040	2155840	came in and wanted to challenge me to a Chrono Trigger quiz, which of course I got and guessed
2155840	2163440	the bonus point question before they even asked. It was the one about the, uh, like what were the
2163440	2168240	name of the gurus? And I was like, well, it's named after the three wise men of legend. So,
2168240	2174560	you know, Casper, Balthasar and Melchior, who is, you know, and he's like, well, that's actually was
2174560	2180640	the other, the other question because it was, you know, who they were. I'm like, well, okay.
2181360	2186240	But it was really fun as I welcomed them to come back in and do the quiz when other people were
2186240	2192480	in there, uh, when I'm playing Chrono Trigger. So that's on Saturday and Wednesday, 8 30 Pacific.
2193600	2200560	Um, we just got, I just got the Epoch last night, so pretty happy. Um, and I'm back in the
2200560	2208640	kingdom of zeal with my favorite music in the game. And, uh, I, uh, uh, of course I'm playing
2208640	2213520	Dead by Daylight. I'm holding off on Fantasian because honestly I'm kind of bored. I'm just in
2213520	2219120	that part where I'm too low level to do boss battles. So it'd be nothing but a grind until
2219120	2225680	I'm ready to do the other things. So it is what it is. So, um, I've decided to put off Fantasian
2225680	2232720	until after I get back from, um, from, uh, LA for my birthday. Um, just to give myself like a little,
2232720	2238560	we're getting, we're going to see other games. We're going to see other games. Um, but I'm also
2238560	2245280	still playing board scapes. Um, it's pretty fun. Um, uh, I've also been playing a little bit of
2245280	2252960	just, you know, pinball in general around the house and yeah, but, um, by the way, I got three
2252960	2263520	adepts the day Sadako came out. I adapted Sadako first day. I adapted, uh, artist,
2264640	2269600	which I've been trying to do. And I just finally just went in and did it. And guess who else I
2269600	2275200	adapted? This one is, is a surprise for me. You were trying to do Billy when I was watching.
2275200	2281120	And I was like, that is, I hate Billy. I hate Billy. Oh, you got close. I got a couple of
2281120	2285200	times. Right. I was lurking. So it was kind of like, there were two hatch escapes on my best
2285200	2292480	games. Oh, ah, damn. But I, I adopted blight. That's hard. Light's hard to control. I played
2292480	2298880	blight three times, including that game. Oh, congrats. And I just, it got, I got me on
2298880	2303360	midwich and I said, I'm going to do what I do with huntress. And I'm going to play him as super M1.
2303360	2309360	I got a couple of Russia tax off, which, okay. That was, that was fine. I hate blight. I hated
2309360	2314240	the outfit. I put him in, I keep forgetting that he drips that crap and he's absolutely disgusting.
2314240	2318880	And it like, he turns my stomach. He literally turns my stomach almost as much as the clown does
2318880	2324880	when he's actually in clown makeup. It turns my stomach. It's just disgusting. But that means I
2324880	2329200	never have to play blight again, just like I never have to play nurse again. Although I am going to
2329200	2337280	learn Sally and Sally is back. We missed her. We missed you, miss Smithson. Welcome back.
2337280	2341040	I quickly go back to the Corona trigger thing for a minute, because I I'm curious about this
2341040	2346160	whole pop quiz in the middle of your stream. It was at the end of it. Actually, my, my,
2346160	2350080	my stream went long because of it. Did the person give you biddies for correct answers? No,
2351040	2356320	I wish they had, but no, they actually followed me. I mean, there was that. So I've okay. Well,
2356320	2360640	at least there's at least you got to follow it at least because I always, I always find it weird. I
2360640	2365600	actually kind of think it's, I mean, I, it depends on the streamer like, and again, I didn't advertise
2365680	2369520	or anything. Yeah, but I'm just like, I always find it tacky when someone comes in and wants
2369520	2373440	to completely like say, I want to, I want to play this game. Do you want to play a game?
2373440	2376880	You know, I don't know. It's, it's, it's weird. But like, if they give me money,
2377440	2382800	I'm a lot less sweet about they're like, Hey, a lot of it is trigger. How much do you know
2382800	2386400	about it? Do you mind if I, if I test you? I'm like, I don't mind. I love stuff like that.
2386400	2391760	All right. Yeah. A lot of it is how you do it. Right? Like if somebody had come in and said,
2391760	2396240	I bet you don't know your chrono trigger. I'm going to quiz you. And if you get these right,
2396240	2400880	I will follow you. Okay. That's because I didn't start off like that. They're just like,
2400880	2405280	how well would you say, you know, chrono trigger? And I'm like, it's been a while, but I think I
2405280	2410080	know my, my stuff pretty well. And like, I was answering stuff about like the soundtrack because
2410080	2416000	I've owned a copy of the soundtrack for years. And especially since it was my favorite one,
2416800	2422640	my favorite song, which is, uh, the corridors of time, but not quarters of time. It's, uh,
2424320	2428080	yeah, I think it's quarters of time, which is the, uh, Enhasa theme,
2428080	2432480	the one for shallow level. I have to remember it again, but yeah, I mean,
2433600	2436880	yeah, it was fun. I had a good time. It was also nice to see Shane.
2437760	2442160	Fifth dream and chat is where I'm thinking with this fifth dream says this comment saying,
2442160	2447040	Oh, you have a Nirvana shirt on named their top 78 songs. That's that's like,
2447920	2453440	that's where I'm like, I, I find that shit tacky, but you were right. And Mike Deft agrees here.
2453440	2457840	It's about the, how it's the, how you do it. And it sounds like it was fine in your case,
2458480	2463520	but I've seen the cringe. Okay. Like if they were, if they were getting,
2463520	2471440	now I will tell you something that one as a female presenting gamer gets is the gatekeeping
2472320	2479120	oval. Prove you're a real gamer. I sorta was wondering if that maybe,
2479120	2482000	and that's kind of why I asked what I did, if maybe that was playing into it a little,
2482000	2488400	and again, it's the way it says, okay, good, good. Because I mean, the moment that someone is like,
2488400	2492240	you know, prove it. I'm like, I don't have shit to prove to you. Prove to me. You're a real gamer,
2493360	2499920	you know, tell me, tell me, uh, what are all of the, the color doors in mousetrap for click-a-vision
2499920	2505520	describe the click-a-vision controller for me. What was the first video game system that used
2505520	2509600	cartridges? Do you know, do you, huh? Food for thought.
2509600	2512640	What was the name of the, of the main character in the guardian legend?
2512640	2514560	Huh? Doesn't have a name. She's the guardian.
2517760	2518880	Food for thought.
2519600	2522000	Food for thought. You have sat by.
2522000	2528160	Yeah, that, that, that's what I would do if someone tried to make me prove things. Cause
2528160	2532400	I don't have shit to prove to anybody. I wouldn't, I would just say, I don't have
2532400	2537840	shit to prove to you a block. Like I, I would, but I, I, everybody has their own freedom to
2537840	2541360	respond. Yeah. But if it's, if it's while I'm streaming, I'm going to get content out of it.
2541360	2546800	So I'm just, let's make it a clip, right? I'll get content out of it. Sure. Why not?
2548080	2552640	What was I going to say? Words with that? No, I was going to say, I was going to say literally
2552640	2558640	Darcy, I know we're not quite to a thousand episodes, but I would say between bonus streams,
2558640	2564320	bonus shows, live events, et cetera. You take a thousand episodes, you multiply it by three hours
2564320	2572000	an episode. You have easily done 3000 hours of content where you talk about video games.
2572960	2574000	Yeah. Online.
2575040	2578240	Yeah. And I would ask even a little bit before that too.
2578240	2582160	Yeah. And I would ask these babies that try to come in and want you to prove like
2582480	2586080	how many hours have you talked about video games? You know,
2586080	2591280	That's like the people who play dead by daylight. How many hours do you have in the game? Well,
2591280	2597840	you can have a bajillion hours and suck at it. I am living proof. I have hundreds of
2597840	2601520	hours of dead by daylight. I still can't fucking loop a killer. Okay. Like,
2601520	2606320	Oh, I took, I'm talking about the people I go, I've got like 50,000 hours in dead by daylight,
2606320	2614240	which for the record, um, I have 486 hours. I would have thought you had more with all
2614240	2617760	the streaming you do. I would have thought you had, well, I'm streaming more, but I was only
2617760	2624880	playing it when I was streaming. So I'm at like 300 hours. Wow. And 67 achievements and only one
2624880	2632080	of them has to do with a survivor. I take that back to the, get out the gate one and the start
2632080	2637760	with a full load. All right. Um, I do, and maybe I like a boon because I played Michaela,
2637760	2642720	but whatever I do want to acknowledge, um, in our chat, uh, we have a hype train going and, uh,
2642720	2647040	I know I don't usually, I don't usually credit all that stuff till the end of the show because
2647040	2652080	we are recording a podcast. And when you're listening on the podcast feed on iTunes, Spotify,
2652080	2655760	whatever it is you use to listen to spot podcasts, you can't see the video. You can't see these
2655760	2660480	things going on. So I don't usually go out of my way to acknowledge them, but, um, because I see a
2660480	2665360	lot is pouring in right now. I just want to say thank you. Um, thank you for that. Really. You
2665360	2671040	all are so generous and kind, and we did it stay tuned for the end of the show. I will give everyone
2671040	2676960	person shout outs after we read it. Okay. Um, let's go to more gaming weeks. Loki, how was your
2676960	2682960	gaming week? Uh, my game is pretty good. It's got my computer back and it's fixed and it works
2682960	2692320	and that's great. It wasn't anything too bad. So apparently it's funny timing too. So it is
2692320	2700160	a new to me computer that was built for somebody by artesian builds. Oh no. We've been in a lot of
2700160	2708080	hot water. Oh, they are garbage. Oh no. Oh, did you see, did you see what they were doing live
2708080	2714640	on stream? Let's go to the wheel of yikes. I watched that shit. That was, Oh, fuck them.
2715360	2720480	Yeah. So, uh, their company's no longer good, which is, it's just funny though, because
2720480	2728960	so this computer is under warranty. Uh, actually with what, with what? Well, it was under warranty
2728960	2736160	when the company existed. Um, you know, now that it's not existing, maybe not so much through the
2736160	2744080	magic though of, uh, internet and my wonderful explet V cam, we can actually take a look at
2744080	2750880	this wonderful new PC. Um, Oh, Oh, getting high tech on us now. Oh,
2750880	2756880	Oh, Loki got the fancy pants set up now. Oh yeah. So, so it's a, so just to explain,
2756880	2762800	I'm showing off my PC case here. Of course, got, you got Loki on top there. Um, and then,
2763040	2773040	so basically this is a 10, 9, 10, 900 KF, uh, with a G-force, a 3080 TI, 32 gigs of Ram and
2773040	2779360	six terabytes of hard drive. And yeah, it's, it's fantastic. And it, it plays Minecraft very well
2779360	2787200	because that's what I've been using it for. Um, because I have to, I mean, but yeah,
2787200	2791120	so I really liked this. I couldn't figure out what color to make the lights because it does
2791120	2795600	have all the wonderful LEDs and everything on it. Uh, but yeah, there's the, there's the horrible
2795600	2800480	sticker. The sticker is on the actual fans that can't take off. That's a magnet. So I can probably
2800480	2805680	fix that, but yeah, I just wanted to kind of show that off real quick. Oh, also has a dedicated
2805680	2813280	Elgato, uh, game capture four K 60 pro MK two inside of it too. So I could even stream some
2813280	2818160	games in four K if I had the bandwidth to do that. If someone can clip this for the podcast
2818160	2822640	listeners. So that way they can see it over at twitch.tv slash VOG network. I did it. So,
2822640	2830160	all right. Thank you for sharing. Um, but, and I love the, uh, Zen monkey 11 and chat says, um,
2831040	2838480	uh, can it pop popcorn? Uh, not that it's fixed now. So it's kind of, it's got a
2839040	2846480	AIO cooler on it, so it doesn't get too hot, but, um, it probably could before cause when I first
2846480	2852480	got it, the AI, the, there was a power cable, apparently not connected to the cooler. So it
2852480	2857680	never came on. And so I would try to boot it up to like, get things working on it. And I knew it
2857680	2861280	wasn't working because some of the fans weren't on the screen wasn't on that type of thing.
2861920	2867280	And so I had to take it to a shop to fix it. Cause I just, it was so tightly cable managed in there,
2867280	2873280	which apparently the guy in the shop said they did it all wrong. Um, but it was just a cable
2873280	2877120	that was loose. Thankfully though, the seller did refund me for the cost of the repair. So
2877120	2885200	that was good. And I specked out the PC on like actual like artisan site, which I are artesian's
2885200	2891440	website. And they have to be overcharging because it, it ends up being like a $7,000 computer,
2891440	2897600	which this is not, I certainly didn't pay that, but like, it's, it's fantastic. I'm not going to
2897600	2903520	need to upgrade this for a long time. And when I do, you know, need to actually update it, I can,
2903520	2909760	because it's not a laptop because I've been on a laptop for a while now. So yeah, I'll be playing
2909760	2915840	lots more PC games, a whole ton of Minecraft still. Nice. Um, I want to explain really quick
2915840	2919840	for the live watchers and this is, you know, podcast people might be curious about this too.
2919840	2925120	I want to explain a button that was just pushed because I haven't seen a lot of streamers use this.
2925120	2931360	So while that happened, Bobby pushed a button. And he and I knew he's been waiting for a good
2931360	2936160	time to push the button. And what the button does is the button creates a moment. So and this is a
2936160	2939760	thing all streamers, I don't know if all streamers have access to it, I don't want to speak out of
2939760	2946160	turn, but I know we got access to do this. So basically, you get like, you get it added to
2946160	2952320	your profile, your your collection for the channel, basically that you were here when this epic moment
2952320	2958240	happened. And you can kind of like collect these into a badge. And so Loki showing off his computer
2958240	2963040	ended up being a moment there. So I think it's kind of I think I think that's a neat idea for
2963040	2969280	Twitch. Like, you know, you were there when this happened. So fun. Oh,
2969280	2973600	yeah. And pot culture saying I should put the make it orange. I tried orange,
2973600	2979600	orange didn't look that good with least these LEDs. So like, I don't know, I'm not feeling
2979600	2984640	orange. I had it, it was defaulted to like rainbow, they just kind of cycle through.
2984640	2991040	But it's kind of like too much with all the LEDs on there. Plus, with the way the lighting works,
2991040	2996240	there's like an app for the case, there's an app for the card, there's an app for the cooler.
2996800	3000800	It's like there's three different apps, I have to adjust to get the lighting all match. It's
3000800	3006560	kind of a pain in the butt. All right, I don't know. Let me go to my gaming week quickly. I've
3006560	3011280	had a very busy week with all the shows and everything going on. So I'm not I don't have
3011280	3016240	a lot to say. However, I also played dead by daylight. I don't know why. But I feel like I've
3016240	3020720	been playing more of it lately, which is weird because the game. There's been less people overall
3020720	3024720	playing it if you believe in the things like steam charts and stuff like that. But I don't know,
3024720	3028320	it's been like when I just need 20 minutes killer cues have been a nightmare, though.
3028960	3033040	Oh, yeah, because well, they just so they just released the renew chapter officially on
3033040	3040560	Tuesday. So Sadako and Yoichi are the survivor are in the game now. And yeah, a lot of people
3040560	3044720	are wanting to check out Sadako. So the cute the killer cues get and that's pretty much,
3044720	3050320	I would say easily half of the killers I go against right now are Sadako when I play survivor,
3050320	3055120	um, which is great, because most people don't know how to player. So I've been getting a lot
3055120	3062000	of survivor points. You want to know what's great, though, is if you are good at hag or Freddy,
3063440	3068080	she's actually pretty easy. Or, you know, yeah, I was gonna say, you know what I found?
3068080	3073680	I have been playing a little bit of Sadako, I really like her. And I, I got like a 4k in my
3073680	3077360	first game with her. I'm not trying to flex or anything. But I think, yeah, there are some
3077360	3082160	intuitive things. And I think it is because I enjoy stealth killers. I really like playing
3082160	3088000	wraith. I really like playing spirit. I like playing those types of characters that can and
3088720	3092080	Sadako her whole thing about warping to the television sets.
3092720	3098560	Um, I love it. It's so powerful. Like and I when I go against other tacos, I feel like they're not
3098560	3105280	using it. Like it's so powerful all the time because they're usually by a generator it in it.
3105280	3110800	You're not only increasing their ear meter or whatever it's called that makes them go into
3110800	3117680	instantly killable. It's a curse. Not only that, but just like you those things recharge so fast.
3118080	3123360	That like, you can port again. So anyway, I won't go get too into the weeds. I know we talk way too
3123360	3129200	much about that game. But it's Hey, it's one we both enjoy. So um, yes, Sadako is a lot of fun.
3130400	3136480	I I don't know, I don't get into the whole tier ranking about because a lot of people say she's
3136480	3141760	not a high tier killer. But I'm like, I feel like I'm doing well with her. But I am also not in the
3141760	3146960	highest tier level of play in the game. So who knows? If I may say one more little thing about
3146960	3151360	that. Of course, of course. There's no such thing as high tier killers. There's high tier players
3151360	3158000	with certain killers. Fair. Um, okay, so yes, I've been playing a bit of dead by day. I also on
3158000	3162880	Friday night, late at night, I was like, you know what? Fuck it. I feel like streaming. I'm back
3162880	3168000	from date night, Alan. I went downtown, went to yard house, had a good meal. And then we're like,
3168000	3173280	you know what? I just want to stream. So I streamed from like eight o'clock. No, no, actually,
3173280	3176880	I think it was later than that. Maybe nine o'clock. I don't know. But I stream for like
3176880	3182640	two, two and a half hours. I did more no man's sky. And I was working on expedition five. And
3182640	3187840	it was really starting to snowball. I got a lot of like the landmarks along the way just like,
3187840	3191840	you know, I found that swamp planet I've been looking for. I got through like four rendezvous
3191840	3196720	points. So I'm making a lot of great progress in that expedition. I'm hoping it'll only take me one
3196720	3200880	or two more streams to finish quite honestly. There's a few grind things I have to do still.
3200880	3205280	But yeah, I feel confident I'll get through expedition five before it's done.
3207200	3212480	With streaming. I'm hoping Alan and I can do a co stream this week because he's finally got his
3212480	3216240	whole streaming stuff set up. So I'm really excited to do that. So I don't know if we'll
3216240	3220160	do no man's sky or we might actually do dead by daylight and do some five together. So that might
3220160	3226960	kind of fun. All right. Pod culture says Rob was streaming late. He was still on when I got home
3227040	3230800	from work. I was on till like 10 o'clock 11 o'clock my time and that's really late for you.
3231360	3236880	I still want to try to survive with you guys at some point because I need to do my depths for the
3236880	3240400	two people that have points in Yeah, let's set a time. Let's get one more. Let's have fun.
3241120	3248400	All right. Anyway, with our gaming weeks. And with that, let's get into some news. I will go
3248400	3254800	right over to Loki and start off our news. Yeah, we talked last week about a bundle through itch
3254800	3261760	IO for the trans or support for the trans community in Texas because of those horrible
3261760	3269920	bills. Well, now we have another bundle that's also on itch IO, featuring $6,500 worth of games
3269920	3278160	for $10. And it's now supporting Ukraine. So you can check that out over there. And yeah, it's
3278160	3286320	going towards the charities International Medical Corp, and voices of children. So it's I like that
3286320	3292640	second one basically helps children cope with the horrors of war. PTSD and readjusting to school and
3292640	3298800	getting back to being kids. Lots of good stuff in there too. They have super hot skate bird.
3299440	3308960	I Celeste. Yeah, I have to check it out. Um, one thing I like there's a game called bumpy
3308960	3312720	dumpy or dumpy bumpy. There's a lot of great stuff in there. I do want to point out though,
3312720	3318720	it's not 1000 games. It's still it's still a huge value. And I'm not trying to because it's,
3318720	3322960	well, it's not 1000 video games. It's actually not even 1000 games because it's it's maybe I think it
3322960	3330400	was like something like 600 PC games, maybe 300 tabletop games, which is cool is awesome. But you
3330400	3333600	know, it's it's gonna be different. It's not something you're gonna launch from your computer,
3333600	3338560	you got to print it out. But then there's also I actually think this is cool. There's like if
3338560	3343760	you're a game maker, I noticed in there, there's assets that are a part of the bundle that you can
3343760	3347360	use, because it was the same way. And I don't think people talk about enough. It was the same
3347360	3352560	way with that very important Black Lives Matter racial justice and equity bundle. I don't remember
3352560	3358880	the specific name of the bundle. But what they were doing on, you know, in 2020, over an itch
3358880	3362960	IO that had a lot of that good stuff in it, too, is that there was a lot of good assets and game
3362960	3369360	making things in it, too. So that is also present in this bundle, which I thought was pretty cool.
3369360	3375680	And honestly, most of these large bundles have that type of stuff in it. Um, you know, obviously,
3376240	3381360	we love to get a lot of great games for a great value. And these like these, there are games you
3381360	3385840	have heard of in here. I don't think that should stop anybody, even if all the games were like,
3385840	3389280	I've never heard of these. You know what, there's a future winner in there, I'm sure.
3390080	3394720	But there are some I wish I knew how to get my stuff into these, I would totally, you know,
3395760	3401760	include my I wanted to ask me to get rude in the communities. Okay, I need to probably like,
3401760	3405840	be more connected to this stuff. But I don't know how to do it. I wanted to ask, but I didn't want
3405840	3411360	to be rude. Like, why isn't your game in there? But at the same time, you don't like nobody has
3411360	3418400	the like, you shouldn't feel forced to participate in that because you have the right to make a
3418400	3421840	profit off your time and that game that you spent your time. Oh, that's hard work.
3422560	3427440	That ship is a long time ago, but it's fine. Like, oh, in my heart, that's where you were
3427440	3432080	gonna that's exactly what you were gonna say. But I think to be fair, okay, but you want to
3432080	3437200	I don't know where like, yeah, I don't know where like, I would throw my stuff in all sorts of
3437200	3443200	bottles. But like, I don't know. Okay, so Bobby, Bobby's organizing you the right direction. It
3443200	3448320	sounds like there are forums that this happens. Yeah. Bobby says they had a thread for about two
3448320	3455520	weeks asking for people to submit. Bobby says next time I see one, I'll ping you. Okay. All right.
3455520	3460320	I see it. Yeah. Yeah. See, I don't ever go in the forums. So that's probably why I don't see any of
3460320	3465440	that. So yeah, there will be a great cause in the future. Loki participate with that's awesome that
3465440	3469600	you want to do that. Because again, like I said, you don't have to. I don't think anyone can hold
3469600	3477680	you. You know, you should but that's awesome that you want to. And hey, it'll how many more people
3477680	3483520	will that get the game in front of which can be a great thing. Exactly. Yeah. All right. Also,
3483520	3489760	the other thing I wanted to say on that is, I thought it was really cool. The itch IO seems to
3489760	3495600	be filling this void that humble bundle used to fill and I'm not trying to shit on humble bundle.
3495600	3502080	I do. There's a lot that humble bundle has done. That is great. And they have done a lot of great
3502080	3506000	charity things and so forth. And they and to be fair, they still continue to do a lot of great
3506000	3512960	charity work. But I think we all know ever since they got bought. Things haven't felt quite as
3512960	3517440	organic, especially when they started doing that fuckery with the sliders that they got called out
3517440	3523760	on and all that other stuff. Like things haven't quite felt the same. So it's nice that this itch
3523760	3530080	IO and it's technically it's not actually itch IO. It's just itch IO is the kind of the method
3530080	3535360	of facilitation of this, but they don't own it. It's the community that really owns it. And that's
3535360	3540880	the cool thing. These bundles and these efforts to get it out there. There's an RPG called thirsty
3540880	3546480	sword lesbians. I'm down for that. Oh, in it. That's in the that one's in the trans
3547760	3552560	Texas awareness thing. It's in the same bundle. Oh, is it Oh, it's in it's in the Ukraine one too.
3553360	3559520	Honestly, there's probably a lot of overlap between the two. But that doesn't mean they're
3559520	3566960	not both great causes worth your money. So as to 100 Matt says I saved my ship for Ziff Davis
3566960	3573120	Humble sadly has to follow by their lead and that that's it. That's exactly it. So it's neat to see
3573120	3579360	that the community sort of fills that whole like gaming doing great stuff space and like the
3579360	3585360	collective power of gaming and all that all that good stuff. figments on there too. Yeah, the
3585360	3589520	chrono code I think the game was called it was on game pass not that long ago it was it was great.
3590080	3597840	And that's in the bundle as well. So awesome stuff. Anyway, um, sadly, I have to follow up
3597840	3602640	with a way less awesome topic. So we go from gamers doing good to really the stuff in the
3602640	3610560	gaming community that eats a lot a lot a lot of work still. And this has to do with a follow up
3611280	3617520	to a lawsuit that an IT security analyst at PlayStation Emma Maggio filed in November,
3617520	3622240	claiming that Sony had discriminated against women at an institutional level,
3622240	3627760	claiming in the allegation she was fired because she spoke up about a gender bias at the studio.
3627760	3632720	And then in the lawsuit, noting she had been terminated after submitting a signed statement
3632720	3638640	to management detailing sex and she experienced there. She filed the paperwork to make this a
3638640	3644320	class action lawsuit. Sony last month tried to have that thrown out saying that the allegations
3644320	3650240	were too vague and could not stand up to legal scrutiny. However, eight additional women this
3650240	3657520	week joined the lawsuit against Sony. So now, there are current and former employees. Only
3657520	3663200	one of them has chosen to remain anonymous. So that's very brave, especially in light of what
3663200	3670000	Emma Maggio's initial claim had said about that she got, she alleges she got fired right after
3670000	3675760	she said about the sexism. So that is very brave that all and you know, the anonymous
3675760	3681120	has their reasons and we are not going to you know, there's we're not going to lessen them
3681120	3686800	because they are staying anonymous. They have their reasons. One plaintiff in this case,
3686800	3691280	has worked at Sony for 17 years and got all the way to being a senior director of program
3691280	3697040	management. And in a quote, Marie Harrington said when I left Sony, I told the SVP and the director
3697040	3702960	of HR Rachel got Godben in the Rancho Bernardo office that the reason I was leaving was systemic
3702960	3709040	sexism against females. The director of HR simply said, I understand. She didn't ask for any more
3709040	3714560	information. I had spoken with the director of HR many times before about sexism against females.
3717440	3721360	Further in the statement, it reads further when two of the females were discussed,
3721360	3726080	managers spent time discussing the fact that they have families. Family status was never
3726080	3731280	discussed for any males. Similar stories in the remaining women's statements.
3733040	3736800	Derogatory comments included. I'm sorry, but I think it's important to hear this.
3737760	3743120	You just need to marry rich. And I find that in general, women can't take criticism.
3744000	3748560	Again, I'm sorry, but I feel like we need to hear that. Oh, this one's even worse. Sorry,
3748560	3752960	I got one more. One plaintiff saying on a work trip at E3,
3756960	3763840	I have a lot of thoughts. Sorry. My brain is like steaming here. At E3, her superior tricked her
3763840	3768880	into having drinks with him at the hotel bar, hit on her even after she declined and told
3768880	3776880	other employees that he was going to try to hit that. When I see things like that,
3778160	3782000	and a lot of this unfortunately goes back to E3 a lot of times.
3782000	3785920	We are object and we are not objects. Don't treat us that way.
3787600	3793920	I feel like a lot of this stuff, when I read about this stuff and like everything that happened at
3793920	3800800	E3 parties and all stuff, I know we've talked a lot about how E3 kind of died many years ago.
3801360	3805040	And I think what we're not saying enough is maybe it's best that it did.
3805040	3813200	And I know for a lot of us, the E3 memories were very different. When I think of E3,
3813200	3816560	and I'm sure Dark Soccer for you, I don't want to speak for you. Maybe I should just ask you
3816560	3821760	what you think of with E3. But when I think of E3, I think of all those neat games we got to
3821760	3828160	see in advance and getting to hang with friends and getting to network with other people like us
3828160	3833680	when podcasters weren't the laughing stock of the media industry and all this stuff. I remember
3833680	3838560	those fond years. Yeah, but I didn't go to these schmoozy parties and stuff like that.
3839120	3845120	And when I hear about this type of stuff, I go like, maybe it's best E3 did.
3845920	3850560	Maybe it's best there is no more E3. Because I sit here and I go E3 is never coming back.
3850560	3856000	The ESA is too clueless on many levels. And then again, I hear things like this and I go,
3856720	3859760	the ESA has always been clueless on so many levels.
3860320	3860820	Oh, yeah.
3861620	3863780	And I don't think they're clueless. They just let it happen.
3864900	3870420	I think it's all of it. It's all of it. They're clueless on one front and they let it happen on
3870420	3875620	another. I think both those things can be true. Um, Jamie, I don't I'm saying these things and
3875620	3879460	I really should let you have a say. I don't know what are your thoughts when I talk about E3 and
3879460	3887380	all this stuff and and let it die. Let people who think like that die. They should not have
3887380	3895620	any voice in the world. They should not exist in the world. They are relics perpetuating something
3895620	3902420	that is harmful to the entirety of society. And honestly, if I had my way I would snap my fingers
3902420	3909380	and they would all first of all, they would have to live through an entirety of what
3910740	3916980	we go through in their minds and then get locked in the pit. That's what I would do.
3918340	3922180	And it's for that reason that I think even though there's many people out there saying,
3922180	3925460	I wish we could just go back to an old E3. I wish there's a part of me that's like, you know,
3925460	3930980	sometimes you just you have to take it. It's like me moving out of my old house. It was always you
3930980	3937780	have to purge it all. You have to purge it all. Even when we were going to E3 though,
3937780	3940900	this shit was happening. Of course it was happening. I'm not sure I deny it wasn't happening.
3940900	3944980	Yeah, but just back in the days of booth babes and shit. Yeah, that's true. That's true.
3947620	3952820	And I'm like, you know, as far as the video game, you know, companies were concerned,
3954020	3957620	women existed for cute games and selling games. And that's it.
3959220	3965540	And that's why I'm like, take it all out back, bury it in a hole, burn it,
3966580	3972740	and then put literal shit on top of it, fertilizer. And now maybe some flowers can grow.
3972740	3979140	And it's not going to be three. It's the thing is, is that E3, the stuff going on at E3 is a
3979140	3984260	symptom, you need to actually get the people perpetuating it, they need to be taken care of
3984260	3990500	through, they need to be gotten rid of, at least thank heavens, we're starting to finally see some
3990500	3995780	of that accountability. I'm not saying lately, we're seeing some of it now in this industry
3995780	3999460	and people being held accountable for their actions. Well, and, and our things now, you know,
3999460	4007780	with bringing them out on the internet and having lawsuits, etc. It's sort of our current version
4007780	4017860	of putting someone up in stocks. You know, they need to be made public examples of, they need to
4017860	4025460	see that these people who are doing this will fall, will become laughing stocks, they will have
4025460	4032660	the finger pointed at them, and they will be in the eye for as bad as they are. And no one wants
4032660	4039700	to be in that type of position. You know, peer pressure like that is a big thing. If they just
4039700	4044820	either need to learn how to keep it to themselves, and not tell anybody what a piece of shit they are
4045460	4049540	or, you know, try not being a piece of shit. The end.
4049540	4056020	Sorry, when you phrase it that way, I just see your face on Clippy popping up in the corner
4056020	4062340	saying, have you tried not being a piece of shit? Exactly. I'm gonna, I'm gonna make, gonna make
4062340	4068020	that a thing. Have you tried not being a, you know, turd? You know what, you have, you have
4068020	4072340	my permission to use it on merchandise, and you can donate my portion to charity. All right.
4072900	4078340	I'll have to, I'll get, I'll actually get, um, my friend Mustefka, who did my avatar for my channel.
4078980	4084260	I'll see if I can get him to do one of, of that so I can make a shirt that says,
4084260	4088260	have you tried not being a piece of shit? And please donate my portion to a lovely
4088260	4091460	trans women charity because trans women are women. All right.
4091460	4095140	Trans women are women. All right. Um, and, uh, so I just
4095140	4098900	wanted to say, and I want to, um, kind of wrap up this, you know, is that we're talking about
4098900	4105460	Sony here and this sucks and Sony's taking a beating. Um, it's something that's happened
4105460	4111540	with Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Riot Games. This is an industry problem.
4112420	4113780	Oh yeah. It's happening everywhere.
4114500	4117780	And so even though now it's this week, we're talking about Sony, you know what?
4118660	4122740	We got to talk about it everywhere every week because it's continuing to be a problem. And this
4122740	4132020	is just an example of that. We can't be silent about it. Silence is, uh, is, uh, uh, what sort
4132020	4140180	of the of complacency and complacency is entropy. So props to these women for coming out and doing
4140180	4146820	what they are doing to hold Sony accountable for this and all of the, uh, marginalized individuals
4146820	4151700	throughout the gaming industry that are finally realizing they're not alone and coming together
4151700	4156420	to hold the industry accountable. I I'm just like,
4158660	4167140	I'm tired of protesting shit that was being protested before I was born and I'm old.
4167860	4173940	Well, not super old, but you know what I mean? It's it's disgusting, you know,
4176100	4180340	and on top of that too, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna, um, put this out there. Your activism
4180340	4186340	has to be intersectional. If you're going to stand up for women, stand up for all women,
4186340	4193380	trans women, women of color, you name it, you know, because that's actually a really big problem
4193380	4198820	going on in a lot of the activist communities right now is that they're really looking at this
4198820	4208340	privileged white CIS female perspective when it's really our more, our more marginalized community
4208340	4214580	that is doing the brunt of the work, the hard work and seeing very little for it.
4214580	4220260	So we need to uplift each other. Um, some comments in chat I'd like to read,
4220260	4225860	um, as she, 100, Matt says, there will be a case study docu-series, et cetera, about this time.
4225860	4231700	It's about what the industry does after this, that we'll be telling, you know, for what it's worth,
4231700	4237140	um, you're seeing this in a lot of artistic industries in the last couple of decades,
4237140	4245380	because obviously Hollywood with the me too movement has had a huge, uh, trash taking back
4245380	4254020	moment. Me too was started by, by a black woman. Do not forget, uh, DGR mass and chat says I'm
4254020	4259700	legit surprised by this was Sony given how they gave Mick Vic McGonia. I don't even know how to
4259700	4264100	say that guy's name. Cause I just don't care about him. Uh, the heave ho for the sexual
4264100	4270900	assault accusations was turned out to be true. Sony is a very, very, very, very large company.
4270900	4274900	And with that, there's a lot, a lot, a lot of people in a lot, a lot of different roles.
4274900	4279300	And so you may have somebody over there that's making the right decision and somebody over here,
4279300	4283860	that's making the wrong decision at the end of the day, it's the corporate policy and the HR
4283860	4289220	and all that, that really set, you know, it, it comes from the top and trickles down. And I, I,
4289220	4293780	I said that way back when we first heard these Activision blizzard and the investigation,
4293780	4298900	it comes from the top and the culture trickles down. And the other thing too,
4298900	4302900	is that you also have to take into account what business culture is like in Japan,
4304100	4315140	where women are still very much not seen in, I honestly think that there there's almost a higher
4315140	4324660	level of ingrained societal misogyny than what exactly we have here. Like it's, you know, what's,
4324660	4330340	what's this, the saying over there is that the, the, uh, the bent nail gets hammered down or
4330340	4335220	something. And if you speak out against something you're there, you're going to try to get hammered
4335220	4345220	down. Um, yeah, so I, I think Rama, it's just a particular individual made the right call
4345220	4349620	and did the right thing within Sony where unfortunately there are still many people,
4349620	4356180	um, that do the wrong thing and, uh, get away with it. So I think that was the point I was trying to
4356180	4360020	make is that you, you have somebody that is making the right call, thankfully, but there's still a lot
4360020	4364180	of people elsewhere that are making the wrong call and getting away with it. If I may say one more
4364180	4370180	thing about that, Rob, of course, stop being surprised when you hear about misogyny, stopping
4370180	4376260	surprised when you hear about sexual harassment, don't be surprised by it. It's every time someone
4376260	4381620	says, I'm surprised to see this happening is the thing that cements it further in my head.
4381620	4384500	That is the last thing on people's mind. They're not paying attention.
4386500	4389940	All right. I'm not saying it's calling anybody out. I'm really not doing it,
4390500	4396740	but it's another symptom. Think, think of how your words do this. Like think of it this way.
4397540	4400820	I know I'm actually literally saying, stop being surprised by it.
4402260	4409220	It's happening. It's everywhere. Don't be surprised by it. Just pay attention.
4411940	4416340	All right. I know, uh, it's very difficult to transition from that story, but we're going to
4416420	4420740	try to do it. Let's go to our next story and try to get back into, well, I don't even know if I
4420740	4425380	would call this happy news. I would just call it news period. It was lowercase, lowercase N.
4426260	4433060	Yeah. Atari did a thing. They bought Moby games for 1.5 million, which I mean, basically
4433060	4438100	Moby games is sort of just like a game archive collection thing anyway. Right.
4438100	4447700	Um, it's, it's, it started in 1999 as a huge database for like video game credit
4447700	4455380	screenshots platform. It's basically the closest thing that exists to sort of an IMDB for video
4455380	4465220	games. Um, you know, basically it was also a good, uh, collection of like retro and pixel art stuff
4465220	4470980	too. So it's pretty neat. Um, and it actually, this isn't the first time it's been sold. It
4470980	4478020	was actually sold to Gamefly in 2010 and it was redesigned. And then it was purchased in 2013 by
4478020	4487940	Jeremiah Freeholtz who changed everything back. Um, and then, uh, uh, they've been running, uh,
4487940	4491780	that person plus, uh, someone named Simon Carlos has been running the site since.
4492420	4499380	And then Atari basically picked it up. Um, the Atari CEO Wade Rosen said, uh,
4499380	4503620	the Moby games community has played a sustained and important role in the documentation,
4504180	4509300	celebration and preservation of video games and supporting Moby games allows us to give back to
4509300	4513940	the community and contribute to its growth and success. It's important to Atari that Moby games
4513940	4518820	retains every bit of its integrity, and we're committed to supporting this site in ways that
4518820	4527620	improve the experience for both contributors and users. So, um, they also are saying that
4527620	4535220	Freeholtz will remain as the general manager. So maybe it is just for support. Who knows?
4536100	4540500	I remember this was rumored a few months ago. It's interesting. It took this long from,
4540500	4543620	cause the rumor feels like it was at the end of last year at this point. I mean,
4543620	4548420	what is time anymore in these day and age? But, um, I remember we had talked about this
4548420	4553060	when it was a rumor and cause it came up as like, well, what the hell is Atari going to do with
4553060	4557700	this site? But we still, I mean, now that it's official and we have a statement from the CEO
4557700	4561940	and all this stuff, you know, I feel like I'm still don't understand what they plan to do with
4561940	4566020	it because they're sure trying to make it sound like we're going to try to keep it the same,
4566020	4570820	which is good because based on Moby games past, you know, they had all the issues when they tried
4570820	4576260	to change it. It kind of went back to the way it was. So I don't know if it's just an asset thing
4576260	4581300	for Atari or what they might ultimately plan to do with it. If maybe Atari, see, I think it would
4581300	4586500	be rad if Atari would leverage a lot of that for some of its retro collections and retro devices,
4586500	4591460	like, Hey, we're releasing this retro collection. And it's all of this informative shit about these
4591460	4598100	old games too. And like all the stuff that's built within Moby games. So yeah, Bobby's
4598100	4602820	correcting me saying it was an intention, uh, announced before and not a rumor. Okay. Well,
4603140	4608020	sorry, my brain can't go back like four or five months. Uh, but it just took this long or whatever
4608020	4613460	to finally go through. So, um, Zen monkey 11 says they're going to make a site to play their old
4613460	4618580	games on it and get history of old stuff as Joe and Hunter. Matt says full integration into their
4618580	4625220	UI for a streaming game service. Oh, I do remember kind of having a thought about wouldn't it be
4625220	4632340	interesting if you go to Moby games, you look up a article on yards, revenge, and thanks to
4632340	4636660	technology such as ant stream or whatever, whatever Atari might have, you can play the
4636660	4641300	game right there in your browser. I mean, it's not very difficult to emulate an Atari 2600 in
4641300	4647780	your browser. It's all just the legal questions of that. And Atari would have the legal grounds
4647780	4653140	to do that. So that could be interesting. Could be. Yeah. We'll see what they, what they ultimately
4653140	4659060	do with it. All right. Now some news that actually is really good, right? Look, Legos Legos
4659060	4665380	are fun, right? Legos are fun. Um, I was actually, it's funny. I went to Moby games to check on my
4665380	4669540	page sites submitted with all the wonderful artwork and everything. And they overrated
4669540	4674020	with all the, or overrode it with all the stuff that was on the steam page. So it erased all my
4675140	4678820	detailed information that I put in there and new screenshots and all that stuff.
4679060	4685860	Thanks Moby games. Appreciate it. Love that the creator themselves is trying to give some insight
4685860	4693060	and it's like, Nope. Nope. It was like, cause I remember I did this a while ago and I had to
4693860	4698260	set it up and everything and I added it and then it overwritten everything. It's fine. Whatever
4698260	4704660	who cares. Uh, anyways, so let's talk Legos. So you may obviously be familiar with Lego,
4705380	4710500	Super Mario. And of course there was Lego Luigi that came out. I think that was last year.
4711220	4719380	Well now, now this year, this August, we have Lego princess peach. She is going to be getting
4719380	4726660	her own set of Lego Mario sets. Um, so she's getting her castle. They have, uh, even like a
4726660	4733060	cat peach, um, outfit they can get and a bunch of other stuff. It looks really awesome. And that's
4733060	4739380	going to be coming out in August. They also kind of expanded with the Lego Luigi stuff with a Lego
4739380	4744500	Luigi's mansion thing. So they have those now. I stopped buying these sets because we have too many
4744500	4752660	of them. My son does not play with them, nor will he put them together. And, um, I just have no room
4752660	4758660	for this. Unfortunately I have not continued with the Lego Mario saga. We had almost all the sets
4758660	4766820	at one point, but yeah, I just can't, but it looks cool. She looks weird, but it looks cool. I mean,
4766820	4770580	I guess she looks equally as weird as all the other Lego characters there and Lego Mario stuff,
4770580	4777940	but just has like a weird like face. I don't know. The face is weird, but it'll still be pretty cool.
4780420	4787860	Um, I feel like a horrible gaming and Lego and nerd stuff fan that I don't have a single one of
4787860	4792580	these sets, but I, you know, and then I see this and I'm like, God damn it. I need to get them all.
4792580	4796420	I want to get them all. And then it's like getting them all is going to be way too expensive.
4797140	4799780	Like you'll have to take a second mortgage on the house you just bought.
4800740	4804660	You wouldn't have to take a second margin. So the thing is they set this up to be like,
4804660	4808900	kind of like a game. So you're supposed to be able to like kind of play with it and like do
4808900	4814420	the scans and stuff, but the game is not very fun. That's the only problem is it's not very
4814420	4818900	fun to play. You kind of just like, pretend to hop it around. It's neat, but that doesn't
4818900	4822660	necessarily mean it's fun. And there's like no challenge to it or anything. There's no anything
4822660	4830420	in it. So the sets don't really always make the best display sets, unfortunately, but some of it's
4830420	4836580	pretty cool looking. Um, at the very least, you know, even like little, um, they kind of like the
4836580	4840340	blind bags that they sell for this stuff. They have, they're on their third series now with those
4840340	4846100	and get a bunch of the, you know, the enemies in there and stuff. So we have a ton of those too,
4846100	4851620	like so many. But yeah, I mean, they're kind of cool sets. I don't know. I just, like I said,
4851620	4857380	don't have room in the house for any more of those. Apparently, it's been successful. I mean,
4857380	4862660	they've had like three or four different, like releases or additional like, I mean,
4862660	4867700	there's so many sets now in the series. So yeah, it's obviously profitable for them. The thing that
4867700	4873460	I really dislike the most, though, about the sets is all of the instructions are in their app. And
4873460	4879300	that sucks because their app drains my phone's battery a lot. And then also, like if my son wants
4879300	4885140	to put together, I had to download the app onto his device. And then he has to be able to do it
4885140	4891060	that way. And you have to like scan the figures in like certain figures that come with each set
4891060	4896100	in order to unlock it in the app. So they won't even give you the instructions without having
4896100	4899540	that. It's just a pain in the butt, like just give you a paper instruction book, please.
4900420	4903620	Yeah, I think they're trying to prevent the paper instruction books from showing up on
4903620	4909540	the internet. But at the same time, they're on their site, their site, I can like I can
4909540	4914020	literally go to their site and view any instruction book for any stuff that they've ever made.
4914020	4919540	Surely, everything is on YouTube. Anything you need to know how to do, it's on YouTube.
4920340	4925460	And you need to fix a tire, fix something in your car, fix something that broke around the house,
4925460	4930340	fix an electric appliance. It's on YouTube, somebody's doing it. Surely every Lego set in
4930340	4935300	existence has multiple people that have well done a YouTube thing is I think what they're trying to
4935300	4941140	do with like the the app and having that all there is they show you how to play with it, I guess
4941140	4945860	they show you like what different things do. And so I think there's a little bit of explanation
4945860	4950020	there. But it'd be nice just to have like the instructions separately, because it's not really
4950020	4953940	that hard to put some of these things together just annoying, like, especially with an old phone,
4953940	4958260	like it used to just eat the battery like immediately because it's trying to constantly
4958260	4963220	communicate via Bluetooth with these devices. And it just was not battery friendly. But
4963860	4968340	oh, they're okay sets like it's just, I'm just not buying any of them. Like they have a giant
4968340	4972180	airship I keep seeing at the store. And I always go look at that stuff every time I'm in like
4972180	4980420	Target and stuff. And I just have no room for it. All right, well, let's move on and talk about
4980420	4984260	something that you won't be getting anytime soon. We alluded to it a little earlier in the show
4984260	4990420	because it showed up during the PlayStation state of play event. However, for spoken with its new
4990420	4994820	trailer also got an announcement. So good. Yeah, it does look really good. But you're going to be
4994820	5000420	waiting a little while longer to play it, which, I mean, is it really bad news? It just means that
5000420	5004580	they're gonna make the weight and have it be good. Yeah, exactly. Wait, and maybe actually have a PS
5004580	5009860	five by then. That is true, too, to be honest. So like, personally, I'm not bothered by this
5009860	5014660	whatsoever. But I know there's a lot of people that are definitely you know, every even though
5014660	5020740	I am very much delay the game, make it perfect, make it a great game when it releases. I completely
5020740	5026340	understand there are always going to be people that are like, Oh, but I was looking forward to
5026340	5035540	that. Okay, have your moment. Eat your Haagen Dazs. Let the moment pass. And we'll all get
5035540	5040900	over it together and enjoy the game when it comes out. And remember, this is good. You know, I could
5040900	5044580	use the good old Miyamoto quote, the bad games back in for Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. We all know
5044580	5050340	that one by now. How about this? Now? A delay was the best thing that could possibly happen to
5050340	5057940	Animal Crossing on the switch in the worst possible way, but a delay was the best possible
5057940	5063140	thing that could ever happen to Animal Crossing for all of us. So something to think about anyway,
5063140	5069540	for spoken originally set to release on May 24. It will now release on October 11. Of course,
5069540	5074340	they don't give a lot of specifics why just saying during the next few months, we will focus all of
5074340	5079460	our efforts on polishing the game and can't wait for you to experience phrase journey this fall.
5079460	5084820	You know what that says to me? There were bugs, there was a lack of polish, something that they
5084820	5089700	found that just wasn't acceptable and they are taking the time to fix it rather than shove it
5089700	5095220	out the door, which I say, good news. And yes, it gives us all more time to actually get our
5095220	5100820	hands on PS fives, which is a whole other challenge of itself. So there you go. But for
5100820	5106980	those for those that are sad about it, you're allowed your moment, take your moment, throw your
5106980	5116340	fit. And then we'll go get over it, it will pass. All right. Interesting. Mike Defton chat says you
5116340	5122500	can buy PlayStation fives both versions right now on Amazon Mexico. I think it is getting easier.
5123940	5127380	I like but you still kind of have to be there right when they go on sale.
5128020	5130500	But it's it's getting a little easier every day.
5131860	5133860	All right. But I want it now.
5134660	5141540	I know I know. All right. Here. Well, this is something I want right now. Which technically
5141540	5144820	I could already get on an old machine. But I think this is cool. Right? Dark Sakura?
5145460	5150980	Oh, yeah. So you can get them some of the classic D&D gold box games are coming on to Steam,
5150980	5155220	although I think a few of them have already been there under different packs.
5157140	5165220	But we're talking about things like the gold box classics that have the forgotten realms
5165220	5170980	collections like the holder and Pool of Radiance, which I had the big ass box for Pool of Radiance
5170980	5175380	back in the day that came with like the the second edition book and everything.
5175380	5177700	I wish I knew what happened in my book. I think I loaned it to somebody.
5178420	5186740	Anyway, you know, and Savage Frontier had a dungeon hack and Menzoberranzan. I always say
5186740	5191380	that wrong. The one that makes me happy is that there's Dragonlance stuff in there. I am a big
5191380	5198740	Dragonlance fan. I have read all the books until they got kind of bad. Don't. Yeah. There's also
5198740	5206340	some Dark Sun, some Ravenloft. Al-Khadim is in there. The D&D Stronghold Kingdom Simulator.
5206900	5214100	And the things that it does not have is Dragon Strike, Spelljammer and the other ones that don't
5214100	5222340	fit into the gold box format. And also, these aren't remasters. These are the original low res
5222340	5229380	same little games. So nothing really has been done to them. But they're the games.
5229380	5234980	So if you want to get them, there you go. I'm not sure they've necessarily aged gracefully,
5234980	5242340	but they're a part of gaming history. And I'm always for keeping gaming history accessible
5242340	5248340	and easily, you know, so we can we can show these little kids today. Back in my day,
5249300	5255220	this is how we did Dungeons and Dragons on a PC. So yeah, I think it's great that it's, you know,
5255220	5263940	at least accessible on modern PCs to a whole new generation. I'm still like, you know, I see
5265300	5270500	people talking about like Fifth Edition and everything now. And I'm like, do you even know
5270500	5278900	what THAC0 is? Did these games have THAC0? I'm trying to I guess around the right time. So
5279940	5287620	all right. Questbuster in chat says easily SSI's golden age of CRPG goodness, that AD&D license
5287620	5291700	was so huge for them. Yeah, I remember these games really were huge. You know, I've talked
5291700	5298580	a lot about my formative years with Commodore 64 gaming. I was probably just a little bit young
5298580	5305220	for these games, and I missed them. But I did get into Ultima though, which I was also probably too
5305220	5310020	young for, but I still was into it, which isn't technically D&D, but you know, role playing games
5310020	5318420	on old PCs. So I but I think it's great that it's coming back. So all right, moving on. I think
5318420	5328740	we're back over to Loki. All right. So let's talk a little bit about active. We haven't mentioned
5328740	5334500	Activision Blizzard in a while. What are they up to? Well, because we banned I actually I had two
5334500	5338180	stories I could have talked about tonight. There was one about Warcraft. What about Overwatch?
5338180	5343060	You may recall, they have been banned from the show until Bobby Kotick is gone.
5343060	5349940	Yeah, so now they're being investigated by the SEC. There's two separate investigations going on.
5351300	5358820	Whether to that some of the higher ups were doing some inside trading.
5360340	5367940	So apparently, there's been some special like, I guess, some specific sales that they've been
5367940	5372900	doing that, you know, they kind of knew that the Activision stock thing was going to be or the
5372900	5379540	maybe the bio was going to happen. But says apparently, Barry Diller is the,
5380260	5386100	the one of the people that they are targeting right now. He served along with Bobby Kotick
5386100	5394740	on the board of Coca Cola. And then what else also, apparently, the Justice Department is
5394740	5400260	investigating whether there's any up any of the options treated, violated insider trading laws.
5400900	5405540	They're also separately conducting a civil insider trading investigation as well,
5405540	5414660	because apparently, the three of the men purchased 108 million in Activision Blizzard shares,
5414660	5423620	only days before the Microsoft sale was announced. And then now they're obviously worth $60 million
5423620	5428180	more. So it's like they got tipped off that the sale was going to happen and then made those
5428180	5437540	purchases. So yeah, I think that they probably are the three also. So we have the very dealer
5437540	5447540	they mentioned. There's Alexander von Furstenberg and David Geffen. So
5447620	5454260	I know that name. Yeah, for the record company. Yeah.
5454260	5461220	Yeah. So but they're, I guess he they're all friends with Bobby Kotick or some people at
5461220	5470180	Activision. And and and Diller said, you know, it was just simply a lucky bet. We acted upon no
5470180	5476100	information. Sure you did bullshit. Sure you did. Because Activision was a goodbye with all of the
5476100	5484260	allegations going on everything. Yeah, shit. I can't say what I want to say, because it's
5484260	5490980	against Twitch terms of service, even if it's hyperbole. I just, hey, you know, I talked about
5490980	5495460	I hosted a John Waters thing last night. Have you guys ever seen Pink Flamingos? You guys ever seen
5495460	5499700	that movie Pink Flamingos? I just want to reflect on that movie for a minute because there's this
5499700	5503780	great scene. I just let's just talk about that movie for a minute because there's this great
5503780	5508420	scene in that movie where Divine she's giving a monologue and she gets up there and she says,
5508420	5515620	kill everyone now, condone first degree murder, advocate for cannibalism, and she's going on and
5515620	5520180	on and on. I just I don't know why but just like I think it's the impact of that show last night.
5520180	5525780	I just have that scene playing in my mind right now for some weird reason. Anyway, completely
5525780	5533300	unrelated, divine, neatly unrelated. But I just for some reason, I guess I'm just stuck on that
5533300	5537460	show. Oh, Rob.
5537460	5539540	I don't know. It's weird.
5540260	5544740	It is weird how it's weird how the brain works. Anyway, back to the story itself.
5548580	5552660	There's nothing to say. There's like, like, here we are doing our little pocket. There's
5552660	5553780	nothing left to say.
5553780	5558740	We're gonna say it's a coincidence. Oh, you caught me. I did some of that insider trading.
5558740	5562980	Yeah. Yeah, conveniently that they made 60 million dollars in a couple days.
5563540	5566420	Very convenient. It was just lucky.
5566420	5570420	Didn't Martha Stewart go to jail for insider trading? Wouldn't that why she went to jail?
5571380	5575140	She did. Now she's BFS with Snoop Dogg. Yeah, that's right.
5575140	5579780	Martha Stewart's kind of rad. Like, actually, like, Martha Stewart's pretty rad.
5582740	5585780	Interesting. She went to jail. So she went to jail.
5589700	5591140	Yeah, I know. Makes you think, huh?
5593300	5596580	Moving on.
5598660	5604340	Let's talk about Gamescom. Gamescom. You know, we had a story last week about the game.com.
5604980	5611700	Yes, not the game.com, but the actual event. I almost want to say similar to E3, but in Europe.
5611700	5616820	But after tonight's discussion, I don't want to say that. So I will just say a big trade expo
5616820	5622660	that happens in Europe, specifically Germany. It is going to be back in person this year.
5622660	5627220	It will be running from the 24th through the 28th of August. Of course,
5628580	5633460	precautions is how we get back to having these sorts of events. So there will be safety measures
5633460	5639220	in place for the usual crowds. There's going to be a limited ticket allocation. What they're saying
5639220	5645300	is better entrance management. Not sure what that will be. Digital queues and extra wide aisles in
5645300	5651300	halls. So honestly, it sounds all like things that shows could have benefited from years ago,
5651300	5659300	but okay, we'll take it. So yeah, Gamescom has been digital only. The last time it was in person.
5660180	5667380	370,000 gamers in 2019. I should say because I was saying it's a game show. It's a trade show.
5667380	5671220	This is open to the public. This is an event that's open to the public. The other show spoken
5671220	5676980	about on the show earlier tonight. Never what? Well, sorry, it was towards the end because it
5676980	5681220	was on life support and they were trying to save it. But historically, it was not open to the
5681220	5688660	public. Anyhow, also, something else they're talking about with this announcement Gamescom
5688660	5694340	goes green, where the company is aiming to be climate neutral, talking about a reduction in
5694340	5702900	avoidance of CO2 emissions and short term issues through carbon offsetting. A random thing to throw
5702980	5708100	in there without specifics, but okay, sure. Keeping climate responsibility in mind is a
5708100	5713220	good thing. So I can't complain about that. For the rest of us that do not plan to go to this
5713220	5720100	show, because that's a bit too far to travel, or whatever reason you have, Gamescom's opening night
5720100	5725460	live will be back. And assumably, that means Jeff Keighley as well, although we don't have the
5725460	5731780	details and the date and all that stuff just yet. But I'm sure we will get all that in the not too
5731780	5742500	distant future. Forward to it. All right. I think what we will do now is take a moment to reflect
5742500	5748020	on a simpler time in the segment that we like to do here every week, and I'll roll the bumper for
5748020	5764340	it. And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out
5764340	5772660	a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the Classic Game of the Week. And Dark Soccer,
5772740	5776340	what did you pick for the Classic Game of the Week this week?
5777060	5785700	I picked Carnival. Carnival is a... Well, it may not be the most exciting game,
5785700	5794580	but I was seriously trying to think of like... I was actually sort of in a Colecovision nostalgia
5794580	5801060	mood. And so I picked a game that we used to play a lot when I was a kid,
5802260	5805620	which of course was Carnival. And I had never played it in the arcade at the time. We just
5805620	5812260	had it on Colecovision. It was a fixed shooter developed by a company called Gremlin and released
5812260	5819940	by Sega in arcades in 1980. It was one of the first video games that had a bonus round.
5820500	5828180	It was ported to Atari 2600, Colecovision, and Intellivision by Coleco. There's a licensed Atari
5828180	5834820	8-bit family version that was published in 1982 by Analog Software, which was a commercial software
5834820	5841540	label for Analog Computing magazine. Acornsoft also did a copy in 1983 for the BBC Micro.
5842500	5850260	So the goal of the game... Now, you have limited ammo. You have to last and shoot things as long
5850260	5857540	as you can. So you basically just have to aim and shoot. And sometimes you can get things that give
5857540	5865700	you bonus bullets. But you have three rows of targets. And then you also have a circle in the
5865700	5872020	center that's got like a pipe wheel on and you shoot the pipes off. Now, you also for your
5872020	5879060	different targets, you have rabbits, ducks, owls, the extra bullet targets. And of course, if you
5879060	5885860	hit something on the higher row, it's worth more points. If a duck reaches the bottom row without
5885860	5892900	being shot, it's going to come fly at you. It's like, come at me, bro. I'll shoot you. You duck.
5892900	5901780	Anyway, you also have pop-up targets above the top row that can either give you awards or can
5901780	5907620	actually take bullets or points when you hit it. So you have to be careful. And that pipe wheel has
5907620	5914180	eight pipes that are in the top one. Each of the points of the value decreases for every shot that
5914180	5921780	does not hit one of them. So your bonus counter increases in value with every target shot in the
5921780	5928740	three rows. And you can collect it by shooting the letters of the word BONUS in order as they
5928740	5935300	cycle through those rows. It stops increasing anytime you hit any letter out of order.
5936260	5942740	So the round will end when all the targets or the pipes have been shot. You get your bonus points
5942740	5947860	for unused bullets, and then you play a bonus round with a large bear that goes back and forth.
5947860	5952420	Each time the bear is shot, it rears up and goes the other way. So you have to shoot that bear as
5952420	5958100	many times as possible until it escapes off of the screen with your limited ammo. After that,
5958100	5965540	then you get the next wave, and every bonus round adds another bear to the screen up to a maximum of
5965540	5972260	four. So, you know, of course the higher levels give you higher point values, more ducks,
5972260	5978900	fewer extra bullets, faster moving targets, and the increased rate of ducks that come on,
5978900	5986100	and the game will be over when you have exhausted your ammunition supply or you've been eaten by
5986100	5995300	ducks. How many games do you know where you get eaten by ducks? Just saying. So it's one of those
5995300	6001540	few games that has two different PCBs. There's two different versions. So normally a game has
6001540	6010580	one PCB with dip switch sets that either switch it to upright or cocktail. And with this one,
6010580	6015700	it had the upright and cocktail cabinets had those two varieties, one in wood grain and the
6015700	6022660	other painted orange and white. The tune that plays is, I hope I don't mispronounce this,
6022660	6033860	Sobre la Solas by Juventito Rosas. It's the song you hear at carnivals. That one, you know?
6034580	6035140	Oh, yeah.
6036900	6046500	And the chip though that it used was a general instrument AY-38910 chip. So it was actually
6046500	6052100	fairly complex when it allowed for a complex rendition of that waltz at the time, and it
6052180	6061460	allowed for the overlaid sound effects. So it was fairly nice for 1980. The Cliccovision port
6061460	6069540	was basically considered to be perfect, like a perfect rendition. And I did find a lot of times
6069540	6076260	that Cliccovision games were pretty spot on, maybe not perfect, you know? And the things that they
6076260	6084980	did when they would do a port would help replace the things that you would have otherwise missed.
6084980	6091300	Does that make sense? Like for Space Fury, instead of having like the weird robot voice,
6091300	6099300	it actually sang kind of like in the background. It was kind of neat. But anyway, in a discussion
6099300	6107700	of the arcade games music is that, in fact, there's a quote by a video game scholar on here.
6107700	6114020	This is, and I'm going to quote, as the track makes use of all three tone channels using two
6114020	6121220	for the waltz characteristic umpapa, you know, thing and one for the melody. The resulting texture
6121220	6126260	is rich enough to do the music justice and the inclusion of numerous sound effects, including
6126260	6134020	three different duck quacks and a bear roar makes for a veritable sonic feast. Again, 1980. But
6135300	6142260	it's pretty, pretty much, you know, a testament. This game is still a challenge. I have this game
6142260	6147780	still. I have my, I have two Cliccovisions. And this is to this day, one of my favorite,
6147780	6155380	favorite games for the Cliccovision. One thing that I will say about it, though, is that
6156740	6159700	on the Cliccovision version, I don't know if it did in the arcade. Cause like I said,
6159700	6165140	I hadn't played the arcade one is that the music would just stop.
6165940	6171460	And then you'd be playing in silence, the little sound effects. So that was like,
6171460	6176260	we'll just sit here in silence and think about what we've done. All these poor ducks were shooting
6177380	6183300	poor ducks, my ass. They're trying to eat you. Like you see though, and like in the sample here,
6183300	6190260	like trying to hit the bonus, that shit was hard. That shit was hard. And the ducks are assholes.
6190260	6195140	Well, and also we used to think about that mechanic where like, you know, and I'm sorry
6195140	6200020	for the podcast listeners, but you can see it kind of flashing on the screen, the minus bullets and
6200020	6205140	stuff. So like if you don't connect with a target on the side and your bullet goes all the way to
6205140	6209140	the top, you actually are going to get a huge penalty for that. You see, you really have to
6209380	6213940	when you're shooting the pies. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's, it's mechanic.
6214500	6218100	And this person on this particular example, I don't know that they were trying to hit the
6218100	6222900	pipe from the other side because the pipes were easier to hit when they were coming down.
6224740	6232100	But anyway, it's, it's just one of those fun little games. Like I would put it up as one of
6232100	6238420	my favorite Coleco vision games. And the only two games that I would probably put above that would
6238420	6244500	be, I don't know, I guess maybe it's like my number five favorite Coleco vision. Cause I put
6245540	6252580	Gorf as number one followed by venture. After that would be space fury.
6254900	6259300	Actually I take that back. Mouse trap would be above space fury, then space fury and then
6260500	6263220	carnival. I love space fury.
6264100	6268660	Space for so good. I mean, it's really just like asteroids plus, you know,
6268660	6271940	I remember this game and I wasn't even a Coleco for, there must've been a version on
6271940	6275940	Commodore 64 at some point. Cause I remember playing this or maybe I played it in the arcade,
6275940	6280100	honestly. I probably played it in the arcade. Well, I mean, but they were also doing all
6280100	6285620	those different ports, unofficial ports for, uh, uh, Commodore 64.
6285620	6287860	That's probably what I played. I probably just played a knockoff,
6288740	6293140	um, but still, um, no, there was a game called world cup carnival,
6293700	6302020	but not an official release of carnival. Well, uh, a great, there was a, uh, a Muppet,
6302020	6308260	uh, at the carnival. That's there really? That's kind of fun. All right. Well,
6308260	6315140	there it is your classic game of the week carnival, which, um, yeah,
6315140	6320100	I don't know what else to say about it. Uh, it's it, I mean, it's something that I played
6320100	6326180	and I enjoyed. Um, it is, it is simple. It maybe hasn't aged well in the graphics and
6326180	6331540	all that department, but, um, I think a classic game. It's challenging to me. Yeah. It's,
6331540	6337620	it is challenging. There's interesting mechanics in it for what it is like a silly emulation of
6337620	6345060	a carnival game, the pipe mechanic, unique, the rotating bonus or penalty unique. Uh, there,
6345060	6350500	there, it has these interesting spins on it. Target shooting games like that anymore. No,
6350500	6355220	no. Well, well, you want to talk about a real classic. I miss point blank. That was like,
6355220	6362340	that game is so awesome. Point blank is a bunch of shooting mini games. I know. And I love it.
6362340	6368900	I guess so this, this one. Well, I mean, we still have the, the gun cons.
6368900	6376100	So for our place, I want a VR point blank, shout out, shout out if he's still in chat because YYR
6376100	6381460	did make that sharp shooter game that is very inspired by that point blank stuff. So I,
6381460	6385700	I should, someone's still making them, but yeah. Yeah. For the most part, I would,
6385780	6393380	I would kill for a point blank VR game for sure. All right. Thank you for the pick and walk down
6393380	6399380	memory lane. Good carnivals. Definitely it, you know, and you know, I actually, um, who knows,
6399380	6405860	maybe I'll bust out the clique of vision and try to get it set up. Right. Oh good. YYR is present
6405860	6410340	to hear the shout out. Fantastic. Thank you. And check it out on steam. Sharp shooter. Plus,
6410340	6416900	excuse me. I forgot the plus. Um, YYR in chat says the only bummer regarding VR shooting games is
6416900	6423380	how would you play two players? Um, well, I mean, you can play through the power of the metaverse.
6424500	6432900	Shut up the internet. Um, yeah, it would have to be an internet thing. All right. Uh, let's move on
6432900	6437860	around the internet and talk about some other rapid fire, uh, news around the industry and
6437860	6446900	Loki will start with you. Don't make me more upset. So good news. Super Nintendo world is
6446900	6454740	opening next year in Hollywood. Great news. I'll take it. How much is it going to cost me? That's
6454740	6461940	the bad news. It'll cost you admission to universal studios, Hollywood, which is probably double next
6461940	6469220	year. We'll see. Yeah, we'll see. Studio Hollywood. We talk a lot about Disneyland
6469220	6473620	here on this show. And yes, Disney has a lot of great stuff. I like universal studios. I think
6473620	6478260	they, I, I realized some people do not like their rides as much. I like what they do with the rides.
6478260	6486980	I think they're really immersive and never been really been a long time should go. We should all
6486980	6490740	go. Would you want to go dark soccer? I mean, if it's like, I don't go, cause I don't want to go.
6490740	6497620	I would want to, I would want to go. Um, you know, it's just, I'm basically using my vacation time
6497620	6505220	for, for my Disneyland trip. Gotcha. Gotcha. Also, you know, it might be adverse to a certain
6505220	6511700	world that is also adjacent. I hate it because obviously I cannot stand her and that's all I'm
6511700	6517700	using her period. Um, but actually, no, I shouldn't say it because her, the musician is fantastic,
6517700	6523060	but we all know that is not who I'm talking about. And yes, uh, she has that little wizard
6523060	6528260	place at the park. Here's the problem. That actually is a fantastic environment before
6528900	6536340	she got a Twitter account. That was a fantastic environment. And the ride is astronomically fun.
6536340	6541780	And the butter beer is fantastic. And I feel like nothing she says or does can take that away,
6542420	6549060	but I, I am well aware that it is the more that when she continues to make even one penny
6549060	6555540	off of that and use that voice to do what she does, it makes us all a little bit skittish.
6555540	6561940	And I get it, but it sucks because otherwise Harry Potter is done with it. It's fantastic.
6562660	6569460	Can like Harry Potter kind of continue on in the equivalent of like how the Connors continued on
6570100	6576340	after that whole thing. Like it's, Oh my God. Brilliant. Brilliant. I mean, yes.
6577060	6581220	Can't we just get the Connors version of that park? Brilliant. Exactly.
6582900	6585380	My God, I love it. Harry hotter.
6588820	6594820	Uh, and then in other news, uh, God of War is rumored to be gaining a TV series adaptation.
6594820	6597700	Sure. Why not? All of them are so, you know, it makes sense.
6598660	6603540	You know, it's funny in this, that we're in this timeline now where there's actually
6603540	6608740	good adaptations of gaming things. Who would have thought that, I guess eventually that they would
6608740	6614820	have to do it right at some point. Uh, we're still waiting for like, well, maybe mixed feelings on
6614820	6619940	the uncharted one, but, um, you know, Sonic the Hedgehog is great. Pokemon was great.
6620580	6626340	Um, you know, TV series wise, I'm sure the last of us is going to be pretty amazing.
6626900	6634420	Um, I really want to see the prominent tears. I want to see fallout. That'd be good. And then
6634420	6641300	Bioshock the, the show. Oh yes, please. We're just getting so like, we are getting
6641300	6646420	these video games shows delivered. And I mean, obviously we have the Witcher, I think is a huge
6646420	6651540	part to thank for that. Oh yeah. Absolutely. The anime stuff too, like Castlevania ending up,
6651620	6656660	you know? Yeah. Yeah. And then, uh, what was the arcane? I haven't seen it yet, but I've only
6656660	6662180	heard like amazing things about it. So, yeah. Oh yeah. Tired on chat says, let's not forget
6662180	6666500	mass effect. Let's not, because it's great that that's back on the agenda too. Cause I remember
6666500	6669860	they were going to do a movie and I guess they decided a TV show works better, which is the
6669860	6680180	right decision. I like the animated thing that had a, um, Vega. Yeah. Like the side story. Yeah.
6680180	6686260	It was really good. So apparently this is in talks with Amazon studios and it's been,
6686260	6693380	uh, apparently the rumors that, uh, Mark Fergus and a hocked OSPI they're known for the expanse
6693380	6698180	and children of men are involved in the project. Otherwise we don't really know
6698180	6702580	more details about it yet, but maybe we'll hear something. If it becomes a thing.
6702580	6706500	I remember seeing that children have been movie. That was Julia. Julia Moore was in that. That was
6706500	6716100	a dark movie. Okay. Wow. Right. It'll be boys. They'll they'll put, they'll put this next to
6716100	6722500	the boys. It'll be boy, you know, boy and the boys. It works. Do what you do. All right.
6722500	6728580	Dark soccer. What do you have for us in rapid fire news? Well, um, there, uh, remember before
6728580	6734260	I was talking about the Tokimeki Memorial translation? Well, it's out now. Um, it is
6734260	6741060	a patch for Tokimeki Memorial under the tree of legends. Um, which is the PC engine version.
6741060	6746740	It has the intro in there along with the, uh, English lyrics to sing along and the ending song,
6747380	6753460	the confession scenes are voiced and it's ready to go. So, um, of course, uh,
6754900	6762820	it, it does have some limitations, but it's available. Um, you can, uh, go find the,
6762900	6772260	uh, translation patch at, uh, translated.games slash SNES slash heartthrob.
6774900	6783380	And then in other news, um, one of my favorite games kicks, uh, which is basically where you
6783380	6795220	have to, uh, trap some lines in a box, uh, title game. Um, it actually is, uh, uh, being added to
6795220	6802660	the arcade archives. Um, so yeah, I'm looking forward to it. Where's my arcade. Where's my
6802660	6811940	arcade archives for gals panic. Everybody. It's the same. That's a different game. We need,
6811940	6818340	we need our key archives for that game too. Yeah, no, I, um, you know, I have to send some cards
6818340	6823780	and letters and angry tweets, uh, to get what you need. I guess kicks is pretty awesome. I'm,
6823780	6830820	I'm with dark soccer. It's, it's a arcade classic. Uh, well, it's, it's funny. You bring up
6830820	6836340	those particular games because they, those games are kicks basically like Ms. New World,
6837300	6842340	it's kicks. They're all kicks clones. So it's it. Okay. Maybe, maybe you had a layered joke there
6842340	6847780	that went over my head at first, but, um, that is, uh, yeah. I mean, kicks is really the reason
6847780	6854660	for all that other stuff. So, all right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some games.
6854660	6860260	We'll be playing a lot sooner, uh, than arcade archives, Ms. New World 96. Uh, let's go to the
6860260	6866500	U S first. Uh, we've got the cruel King and the great hero on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four
6867220	6872100	Dawn of the monsters on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five,
6872100	6878420	Xbox one and Xbox series. Wow. You know, I didn't think that this would happen,
6878420	6882740	but we're getting new grand theft auto games, grand theft auto online,
6884100	6888340	which I think is now its own separate thing as well. Uh, that's coming out for PlayStation
6888340	6894900	five and Xbox series X, and then grant the thought of five, the brand new game from rockstar,
6895620	6902020	not a game that's been out for almost, I think it can be a classic game of the week at this point.
6902020	6909380	Um, that is on PlayStation five and Xbox series X this week as well. Uh, Phantom breaker, um,
6910340	6914820	uh, or Omni, I guess that's what it is. Um, that's on PC, Nintendo switch,
6914820	6920180	PlayStation four and Xbox one. Oh, a game I've been waiting for, for a while actually tunic
6920180	6929700	that's coming out on PC and Mac and Xbox one and Xbox series. Uh, we have anno mutinium,
6930420	6937860	uh, that's on PC, PlayStation four and PlayStation five. Uh, I guess this is a close to my,
6938500	6942900	you know, want for a gals panic game, but we have gal gun double pieces coming in,
6942900	6950100	Nintendo switch, uh, persona for arena Ultimax on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four
6951220	6957860	shredders, not the ninja Charles thing, but it's a snowboarding game that's on PC and Xbox series,
6958820	6964580	strangers of paradise, final fantasy origin. Woo boy. It's out this week on PC,
6964580	6971460	PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. And last but not least Siberia,
6971460	6978020	the world before that's on PC. All right, let's go to Japan and check out the releases there on
6978020	6982660	the Nintendo switch this week on March 17th. It might be St. Patrick's day over here. Uh,
6982660	6986740	but in Japan they get released. Gal gun double piece is also out in Japan.
6986740	6994020	Persona four arena Ultimax is also out, uh, a game call called Senran Nin Ninja,
6994020	7002420	Tyson Neptune. Shoujo tai chi no kyuen is out. Uh, it's from compile hearts and I'm trying to
7002420	7008740	figure out what it is. It looks like it's, Oh, it's, um, okay. It's a Neptunia and Senran Kagura
7008740	7014500	crossover. So it's those two series. It's one RPG with both, um, those kind of like, uh, worlds in
7014500	7019700	them. It's kind of neat. I think some people will be into that. Uh, and, uh, let's see what else on
7019700	7023460	the switch. I guess that's it for the switch. So let me check the PlayStation five. Yeah. I was
7023460	7028740	pretty sure I'd see stranger of paradise, final fantasy origin also out in Japan this week. You
7028740	7033940	know, I, at first I didn't think I really wanted to play that game, but the more I hear about it
7033940	7038100	and the more people are kind of reacting to the demo and stuff, I'm like, I kinda, I might have
7038100	7045140	to try it. Like I just dropped 60 bucks on it. You know, is it like a beat him up game? Like what is
7045140	7051940	it? They're saying it's like a team Ninja. Yeah. It's like a souls ask type. Really?
7052660	7058660	It's team Ninja doing the soul. Yeah, I know. Well, not, not literally like, you know,
7058660	7064900	everything is, you know? Um, so I wanna, I wanna try the demo at some point. Um, but except they
7064900	7069140	won't put it on a Xbox for whatever reason, but I'll have to watch live streams or something to
7069140	7074180	truly get a sense if I really want it. Here's the thing. I didn't talk about this during my
7074180	7077540	gaming week. Cause I didn't actually play the game, but I need a moment before we get to our
7077540	7084340	next segment and sorry, the UK dates. I just need one moment to talk about chocobo GP because that
7084340	7091780	came out on the switch and I down Loki's face palming already. Um, Oh, sweet. Rama says the
7091780	7095940	demo is out on Xbox. Oh, I didn't see it in the app. Okay. I'm going to, I'll grab it. Rama. Yay.
7095940	7103220	Thank you for the heads up. Um, but chocobo GP. Apparently they, I, from what I am understanding,
7103220	7109460	most people that did the early reviews of the game did not know the extent of which there is
7109460	7114820	like premium currency and gotcha mechanics in the game, because I guess they didn't really unlock
7114820	7120100	all of that until the game was released. And I'm sorry, but that is fucking dirty. That's just
7120100	7124980	straight up dirty to hide that stuff. And again, I don't have a full sense of it. So if I'm wrong,
7124980	7130740	I'm sorry. But what I'm not sorry about is it sounds like you pay $40 to get this game.
7130740	7134100	Yes, there's a free version, but the free version has barely anything in it.
7134100	7139860	You pay $40 to get this game. And then there's a whole gotcha mechanic on top of that with unlocks
7139860	7144580	and stuff. Oh, but you can do the pay currency. If you want to get things faster. It's it's, uh,
7144580	7149300	Bobby was calling it Genshin impact on his show, except you're paying $40 to get into it.
7149300	7153860	And that's something about that really bugs me with as much as I was looking forward to chocobo
7153860	7159460	GP. Now grant, I haven't played it myself yet. I probably will. I might even drop the 40 bucks,
7159460	7165620	but I'm a little nervous to now. I'm like, I feel like this game any day now is going to drop to 20.
7167540	7171460	But then of course, there's the whole, well, if you buy it now,
7171460	7177300	you get the store unlocked for free. That that it, by the way, that is literally a thing. You get
7177300	7183940	the store for free. I have to pay for the store. How do I pay for a store if there's no store to
7183940	7193780	sell me the store with in game currency? So just just marinate on that for a bit. So like, I don't
7193780	7200820	know. I was gonna say I don't know who told Square Enix this was a good idea. I do know who money
7200820	7206180	hold them. It was a good idea. The same people who said the same people who convinced, you know,
7206180	7209940	the head of Square Enix, the NFTs were a good idea. These are the people that are saying it's
7209940	7216340	a good idea. It is not a good idea. Just charge 60 from the game for the game if you feel the
7216340	7220420	need to and just put everything in it. For the love of God, just put everything in it.
7222180	7225700	So anyway, sorry, just wait for the special edition to come out later on with everything
7225700	7229620	in it. Sorry, I wanted to get to the UK dates. But like that, that was bugging me. And that's
7229620	7236260	why I'm nervous to take the risk on I mean, a Square Enix game, let alone almost any game at
7236260	7243220	this point. Sure, I'll pay 60 bucks for Strangers of Paradise, then what? Anyway, Dark Soccer,
7243220	7248580	what's coming out in the UK? Um, well, the place I normally get my stuff from is down.
7248580	7253220	But at any rate, there's only one game and that's core keeper for PC on the eighth of March.
7255460	7257940	Wait, it's already passed. Nevermind. It's out.
7260340	7265620	Nice. I think Strangers Paradise also in your I'm pretty sure it's a worldwide release.
7265620	7269540	Yes, it is. If you're saying like I said, none of them are working.
7269540	7279460	So all right. Well, it happens. So let's move on. Or gaming companies getting involved in
7279460	7285620	world issues. But this is one that people need to bring more awareness to. So Loki, what do you
7286420	7292580	Yeah, so EA and gearbox have signed an open letter opposing the anti trans bill in Texas,
7292580	7298180	because that's a horrible thing that's going on right now, on top of everything else. So they
7298180	7303780	have this, this thing that ran in the Dallas morning news, basically saying discrimination
7303780	7311220	is bad for business and calling for the governor to abandon the anti LGBTQ plus efforts that they're
7311220	7320420	doing, which they won't, but you know, it was signed by EA, Microsoft gearbox. And I think
7320420	7326660	those are the only companies that they mentioned right now. So thank you to the companies for
7326660	7331220	doing it. It would be more meaningful if you would move your businesses to other states.
7331220	7336660	But I understand that is something that's easy for me to say, that would impact a lot of lives
7336660	7341700	that is not easy to do. And I'm very careful to choose my words, because I have a lot of friends
7341700	7347460	that live in Texas, that what nothing to do with this bill. And I ever bear to tell somebody,
7347460	7352420	you should just move because your state sucks. I don't want to run away from problems. I want
7352420	7360260	to fix them. So I just hope my friends that are in Texas use their voices against this
7361380	7368340	fuckery that's going on. Other companies that were signed on with that as well. Apple, we have
7368580	7377300	a meta PayPal, Pinterest, right twice a day in medicine. Yeah. Patreon,
7378980	7385220	Ikea, Ben and Jerry's, lots of companies, lots of companies. But the governor, the governor will
7385220	7390660	not do shit until the money starts talking. And that's what you see happening in Florida.
7390660	7395700	With can we sanction them like we're saying she's in Russia? Or but again, do we do that?
7395700	7400500	It's caught. It's complicated. Loki. Here's the thing with Florida and that whole thing,
7400500	7406660	which they are two very different things. But they are both attacks on the LGBTQ plus community.
7409780	7414100	Is that your notice? Can we trade Florida for you? Shut up and let me make my point.
7415780	7422580	Is that you see Disney. You know, they had their first response. And it was really the employees
7422580	7431620	of Disney, who rose up and said, Hey, CEO, you represent us. And your answer wasn't good enough.
7432660	7439540	And they weren't afraid even though to go to your CEO and say, Hey, do better,
7439540	7445380	is not an easy thing to do. They did it. And you know what that CEO did? And I will I will,
7445380	7449620	you know, I know a lot of times we want to say it's not enough to do. You know what,
7449620	7454900	if we want opinions are not going to change overnight. I will appreciate that the CEO of
7454900	7461380	Disney at least acknowledged, said maybe I didn't do enough. And I'm sorry, and I'm listening to my
7461380	7468740	employees. To me, that's a step in the right direction. We just need a lot more steps from
7468740	7477460	many people to get us to where we need to be. Because clearly there is still anti LGBTQ plus
7478340	7483780	people in this country that keep trying to push these ridiculous things. And again,
7483780	7488900	I'm going to explain to you why the Florida bill is bad. Because every everybody that supports it
7488900	7494500	is like, where in the bill does it say don't say gay, you're missing the fucking point.
7497700	7502900	Where in the where in the bill does it say, say, heterosexual?
7503620	7509220	Because that is the context of the bill. If you think about it, it doesn't it doesn't say it
7509220	7512260	doesn't say you're not allowed to talk about heterosexual stories and all that sort of thing.
7512260	7518660	And you know, the whole thing. So I so you know, again, do you do you believe that the relationship
7518660	7524900	between Alan and I and our cat Mr. Smoosh? You believe that a kindergartener shouldn't hear
7525540	7529140	shouldn't hear about that? Is there something bad about that?
7532420	7535700	Anyone who thinks that there's something bad about that has something wrong with them.
7536980	7541380	And it's just that that's where it just kind of personally hurts, you know, a little bit. And I
7541380	7545700	know none of my friends feel this way. And I know the vast majority of people who listen to this
7545700	7552980	show. But I also know, there's a couple of you, who you that put up with our political tirades
7552980	7556260	for the gaming news. And you know what I appreciate I do appreciate that you hang in
7556260	7560580	there and listen to people that think differently than you. I do appreciate that. But I just want
7560580	7566980	to tell you why it hurts. And why it's much more than this whole argument of where in the bill
7566980	7574820	does it say you can't say gay. You all know damn well what it means. You all know damn well what
7574820	7581700	it means. Don't fucking try to mind game someone who's personally affected by it. It won't work.
7582260	7587540	Because they've been playing mind games with me from the very first day. And you know what I mean
7587540	7594900	by that? I'm gonna say something that a lot of people are not going to like. But I'm saying it
7594900	7602260	anyway. Because I know from experience, is this bill going to get seven year olds to stop calling
7602260	7610420	each other a faggot on the playground? Because I guarantee you it won't. Because it happened to me
7610500	7616260	a lot. And I bet it happened to many of you a lot. And you know where they learn that word?
7619300	7623300	They didn't learn. That means some of them learned it at school. They don't learn it in a classroom.
7625940	7627860	So I just want you to think about that for a minute.
7631140	7636580	So I don't understand why. Anyway, sorry, I'm getting too preachy. But yeah, thank you,
7636580	7641460	Mike Depps. I just want you to understand how I personally feel affected by that. Now,
7642180	7648420	for my trans brothers and sisters, now we have this whole thing in Texas that's going on. And
7648420	7660900	it's I don't even have words. Where does the state think they can get between a doctor and a patient
7660900	7671620	and a family? Who the fuck do they think they are? I just it's infuriating. Period.
7675540	7680500	Going to chat. SSU and Hunter Matt says my girlfriend is a school teacher who teaches
7680500	7685700	ELA English and language arts. She has a classroom library that includes books and graphic novels
7685700	7690100	that include positive and appropriate LGBT plus stories that her kids are welcome to read on their
7690100	7695140	own. By this law, she would be fired or sued for this. Over the years, she has had kids come out
7695140	7701140	to her, asked her to refer to them as a different pronoun, or asked her for more info about LGBTQ
7701140	7707620	plus. Kids should have a safe space. Indeed. I can't tell you how meaningful
7709780	7716420	drag queen story time would have been to me at that age. But instead,
7716420	7722580	I participated in it just to see the look on people's faces is amazing. I did it as a sister.
7724260	7728580	But instead, you know what I got? I got invited to play smear the queer.
7731780	7736660	And again, I'm sorry. I know I'm sure Bobby's wincing because I'm using language that's against
7737620	7742740	Twitch's terms of service. But I am allowed to say those words and I'm saying them to make a fucking
7742740	7750180	point. And if you don't like those words, maybe we should stop saying them. Because I heard them
7750180	7758100	a lot when I was a kid. Yeah. Anyhow. All right. Thanks, Bobby. Thank you for your support. I know
7758100	7763460	you support me at the end of the day, Bobby. But I'm sure I'm sure there's a little piece of you
7763460	7771460	that's like. All right. Anyhow, but thank you. All right. Moving on. Please, please a happy place.
7771460	7777140	Tell me about a very good game. Somebody, Dark Sakura. Isn't me? Yeah, I think so.
7777940	7784020	So they did an update for Chrono Trigger on PC that now supports ultra wide monitors.
7785700	7791460	Squinix updated the steam version is the first update in four years and it adds the 21 to nine
7792420	7797620	resolution, improved D pad controls and user interface improvements for quality of life.
7798340	7805780	And on top of that, like the ultra wide support is kind of a rarity because not even Elden Ring
7805780	7814660	supports it natively. So pretty cool. Yeah, I mean, I'm still playing this next one. But,
7814660	7819700	you know, I like when they tweak retro titles like this, though, especially,
7819700	7824180	this is just a random update so far after the fact, but it does make you wonder what are they
7824180	7828340	plotting over there? But I think this is great, you know, and.
7830820	7835140	You know, yeah, I don't have an ultra wide monitor myself, but I think it'd be a trip to see.
7836420	7840820	I'd like I'm tempted if it's going to be compatible on my Mac, I'm tempted to try it out.
7842020	7846900	Once you beat what you're working on, then say, OK, let's play it again. But on the ultra wide
7846900	7853780	monitor. So, yeah. And you know what? The chat room is already starting shit on this whole super
7853780	7857460	Metroid versus Chrono Trigger thing, which is a years old joke. And I was sort of I want to
7857460	7862660	make sure we are absolutely clear on this. I have never said I hate Chrono Trigger. In fact, I like
7862660	7869460	Chrono Trigger a lot. A lot. It's just you know what, when they give the Oscars away.
7870980	7875780	I would nominate Chrono Trigger for an Oscar. I just gave the statue to Super Metroid.
7875780	7880740	It doesn't make Chrono Trigger bad. Get over it. And you know what many of you feel differently
7880740	7884020	and we give the statue somewhere else. That is fine. Opinions. We have them.
7884980	7888420	But I love that a retro game is getting updated like this and all these new.
7889220	7895540	All this good stuff. Of course, of course. Since you all brought it up in chat.
7897540	7901860	How much more would I love it if Nintendo would do some of this stuff on the PC?
7901860	7907300	I know I know Nintendo's whole mo is they've got to be played on Nintendo. But give me a break.
7907300	7914020	How fucking rad would that be? If something like Super Metroid were playable on PC officially
7914020	7915860	on an ultra wide monitor and all this stuff?
7917060	7917860	That'd be cool.
7917860	7921220	I would love that. I think a lot a lot of people would. I know.
7922900	7925700	And I'm sure in 10 years when they finally catch up to modern day,
7926900	7928660	maybe they will experience that.
7929460	7934900	Well, and plus, then when they when they put things on PCs, people can mod them. Right, Loki?
7935300	7945380	Yes, they can. And so one example of that is this new leather jacket for cloud that was made for
7945380	7952980	Final Fantasy seven remake integrate. And there was some I love it. There was some criticisms
7952980	7960820	of the mod on the Nexus mods basically saying that, hey, there's too much of his abs showing.
7961380	7965780	He make a version with the midget without the midriff and you got deal salesman.
7966500	7968740	Can you make a version that doesn't expose the belly?
7969380	7977060	Any way to get a version without the belly exposed? So the the mod creators like done,
7977060	7980740	his stomach is now covered. And they put tramp stamp on him instead.
7980740	7981300	I love it.
7982020	7987060	This is one of my favorite trolls that has ever occurred in gaming is I just want to say whoever
7987060	7988980	this moderate what's the who's the moderate again?
7989780	7994500	The moderate is a joy and joy job. I don't know how to pronounce that.
7994500	7995140	Okay, names.
7995140	7996420	Jay Jay.
7996420	8003860	You know who you are? I love what you've done here. Keep doing it. Make people mad.
8005220	8006340	Love to see it.
8006340	8007140	Love to see it.
8009380	8016660	And here's the thing. If this mods not for you, then this mods not for you.
8018020	8024660	There are thousands of other mods available. We'll find one that's for you.
8029300	8037380	If they're that insecure in their masculinity or their sexuality.
8038980	8042980	Ain't a problem with ain't a problem with the mod y'all. It's a problem with you.
8043940	8045620	If you don't like it, don't use it.
8046580	8050100	I love dark Tetsuya is saying here stupid sexy cloud bod.
8052420	8053620	That is the right comment.
8055940	8063060	You're allowed to be a little turned on by some some, you know, imaginary fictional dude abs
8063060	8066820	with a tramp stamp. I mean, you're allowed to have you rock that.
8067940	8073540	Have you ever looked at a bodybuilding magazine? Have you ever in your life seen a body? I mean,
8073540	8077380	I know they don't really sell magazines anymore. But maybe you can think back to a time
8077380	8083620	when you would see bodybuilding magazines. I mean, have you? Okay, I got a better one for you.
8085540	8088820	And I'm gonna hit some of you right in the jugular. So get ready. You ready?
8089940	8092260	Have you ever watched pro wrestling?
8094100	8095460	Have you ever read a comic book?
8095460	8106260	All right, but with dudes like that, that it's all it's all man fantasy. Just saying,
8106260	8110820	I do like the the Mega Man Buster arm that they have for Barrett, though. That's a pretty awesome
8110820	8115300	looking mod. See, there's lots of awesome stuff out there. I it almost makes me want to get the
8115300	8119780	game on PC just to fuck around with the mods. But I'll wait for Alan to inevitably buy it and
8119780	8126020	stream it because he'll he'll mod it away. Because Alan is the one that got the Resident Evil to
8126020	8130660	remake mod that had Leon or whoever's the star in that game. I remember was Leon or the other guy,
8130660	8137860	Chris. Chris is the one Okay, eventually, Chris is just running around the entire game in his panties
8137860	8143860	that and that's the mind that Alan and Alan played. I don't know. I don't think it was a
8143860	8148260	jockstrap. I think it did cover the cheeks because he did have to walk a fine line with the Twitch
8148260	8155380	terms of service. But it covered just enough it was it was the bare minimum of what needs to be
8155380	8164260	there. But you know what, if it had been a female character, the one would matter. So anyway,
8164980	8176020	just put her in a hot tub. It's fine. Humans moving on. I thought maybe for a final note tonight,
8176020	8181700	we could go back and talk about Mortal Kombat because get ready everyone. Mortal Kombat is
8181700	8191700	turning 30. Oh my god, how old are you? Mortal Kombat is 30. So Ed Boon posted some tweets and
8191700	8198500	you can see his Twitter account at noob de. If you want to see his get N O O B D and over at
8198500	8203220	Ed Boon's Twitter account. He talks about some behind the scenes moment actually shows a video
8203220	8209060	where you can see where Scorpion and Sub Zero's fight stances came from. And I did check out the
8209060	8213940	video, which was funny, because in the video he talks about, well, you know, the ice dude is going
8213940	8218420	to do that like Sub Zero didn't have a name yet. So they were just saying the ice dude or the ice
8218420	8223620	ninja or whatever is like they didn't really have names yet. And he's actually explaining the whole
8223620	8227940	like, well, what we're going to do is we're just going to palette swap, you know, and change. And
8227940	8231940	you know, that was obviously a huge thing in the industry to make new characters out of palette
8231940	8236500	swaps. And obviously Mortal Kombat became hugely known for that, especially with those two
8236500	8245700	characters, because what we had Sub Zero, Scorpion, Ermac, Rain, well, reptile, reptile, there was
8245700	8251700	just like, and then honestly, Cyrax and the sector and all that was kind of smoke was all that too.
8251700	8257620	And then Molina, Katana, Jade was a palette swap thing, you know, Mortal Kombat lived and breathes
8257620	8264020	palette swaps. So it was neat to see the kind of really early images of that. I mean, we've seen
8264020	8268900	these behind the videos things from Mortal Kombat before. But I don't think we've seen these
8268900	8273540	particular, you know, elements and in this particular context, which I thought was really
8273540	8278660	good. And you actually kind of hear the whole, both characters would feel different. And all it
8278660	8284900	takes is seven frames for the characters to not just have a palette swap, but to have stance
8284980	8290180	changes. So that Scorpion and Sub Zero really looked different when they stood there,
8290180	8294500	even if all their kicks were the same, even if the uppercuts were the same, etc, etc.
8294500	8298980	It really just took those stance changes to really make them feel like separate characters.
8298980	8305380	And I thought that was kind of a neat thing to get into talking about and kind of see that there. So
8305380	8309460	that was, that's pretty cool. So if you haven't seen that video, check that out on Twitter.
8309460	8316420	So how about a listener roundtable? Every week we invite your emails participate at
8316420	8322020	orangelandtrader.com your phone calls at our discord, fog network.com slash discord in the
8322020	8326340	green room and other ways other comments and chat if you have anything we haven't talked about that
8326340	8331540	you'd like us to. I don't think I saw an email but let me check in with the officiator of the email.
8331540	8336900	Okay, well, there you go. So please send us emails participate at orangelandtrader.com.
8337780	8342100	Um, historically on the show, when there have been no emails, we'll talk about Drag Race.
8342100	8347140	But I haven't watched all I hear about the new season is that it's not going anywhere. Like they
8347140	8353940	never eliminate girls. Like it's the season. I haven't watched in a while. So I just I'm out
8353940	8359300	of the loop. I guess it jumped the shark. I don't know. I still support the art of drag and local
8359300	8364900	queens and even even the ones on TV love them. But I just I think the formula of that show is just
8365860	8367140	Yeah, it kind of worth it.
8368660	8374100	Roo Roo is also kind of antiquated. Now I'm gonna say it. I'm just gonna say it.
8375460	8379220	There's a lot of versions of the show that don't have Roo's involvement, but
8379220	8382340	they they're still derivative of this show. I feel like I'm just kind of
8383220	8386020	seen it a million times literally a million times of this. No.
8386980	8392980	Well, I like that when they bring out somebody who is different, like I really enjoyed Evie Oddly,
8393540	8399060	for example. I enjoyed meeting Evie Oddly. What a fascinating person.
8400420	8404820	What I have heard about this season is that there's like five trans queens and like four
8404820	8409140	of them came out. I shouldn't say because of this process, but during this process,
8409140	8413940	whether it be on the show after the show, or whatever it is. So and I'm sorry if I'm getting
8413940	8417860	the numbers wrong. I haven't been following that closely. But I know it's a significant amount of
8417860	8424740	the contestants. Oh, yeah. I'm dark to see you with a topic for us and chat says I know y'all
8424740	8431700	are probably not fans of GameStop. But they have the at game legends gamer mini for 50 bucks.
8431700	8437700	I got me one super fun to play around with. It's the at games legend gamer mini. I think
8437700	8443060	this is like one of those full arcade machines. But it's like very small. I'm trying to look.
8443220	8453700	Okay, it's a controller. And you hook it up to a TV. Oh, that's pretty clever. So you it's like
8453700	8459940	a wireless arcade controller. And it has a streaming arcade console that it works with.
8459940	8464340	And apparently there are 100 to 150 builds. Actually, I'm not looking at the mini though.
8464340	8470420	Oh, here's the mini. The mini is just smaller. It only has one side of it slots for the optional
8470420	8476820	pinball kit. Really? That sounds kind of neat. Yeah, there's some buttons on the side that look
8476820	8482740	like flippers. What's in this thing? Hold on now. Hold on now. Oh, jumping out right there. Bad
8482740	8487860	Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja right there is playing behind me here. Bubble bobble burger time
8487860	8491620	elevator action. What are the pinball games? pinball? Maybe they're not in the mini.
8493860	8498580	This is very this is very much a mishmash of all these different games from different eras. Wow.
8499540	8503140	That's pretty cool. What's in the big I want to see what pinball games are in the big one.
8505300	8511620	I know you didn't bring up the big one dark Tetsuya but I did. Oh, I don't I don't see maybe
8511620	8515060	the the pinball thing must be a separate thing. I should go to the chat. They're probably yelling
8515060	8521060	it out. I'm not seeing it. Oh, it is a pinball upgrade. And dark to see it says it is very easy
8521460	8530020	to mod apparently sting it. It looks at me for 50 bucks. That seems like a lot.
8532180	8538020	You have my interest off to check that out. We have a call coming into our discord. And this
8538020	8545940	is fun because I have yet to try this. So you'll have to excuse me while I'm rearranging the shot
8545940	8552980	live on air. But let's get to it. We have a call. And I'd like to bring this individual on. Hello,
8552980	8560340	you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? This is why we are Hi. Hi, why we are How are you?
8562020	8566260	Not bad. But wait, we've yet to try this. Oh, that's right. This is the first time you're
8566260	8571380	taking a call from your new digs, isn't it? Click, click, click, ding. You got it.
8571780	8578580	Yeah. Nice. Nice. And I even have my camera set up the this time. Congrats, I will get you I will get
8578580	8582100	actually it didn't fuck up the shot as much as I thought it would. So I will get you on the
8582100	8586420	screen shortly. But while I work on that, why don't you tell us what's on your mind tonight?
8587540	8592260	Well, I'm actually a couple of things. But first off, I just kind of wanted to
8593860	8600020	reply to your reply from my email from last week, because I and I think it's an interesting
8600020	8606580	conversation, honestly. But you know, I started off by saying that I found Metroid fusion to be
8606580	8613380	disappointing because it switched things up too much for me. Whereas, you know, then you brought
8613380	8619940	up dread, and how, you know, it kind of forced you to play a little differently. And that kind
8619940	8630260	of threw you off a little bit. And I have to say I actually felt the same. The as as I started to
8631620	8637540	deal with the Emmy zones, and how they basically force you because honestly, like that's kind of
8637540	8644980	how I played Metroid also, in the past, kind of slowly, deliberately, you know, take my time
8644980	8652420	exploring. I, the opposite of a speed run, I didn't find myself charging through any particular
8652420	8660500	areas or anything like that. You know, I would generally play more slowly. So then now, these
8660500	8668900	Emmy zones are forcing me to kind of dash through and attack aggressively and, you know, just
8668900	8676820	completely, it took me out of my comfort zone. And then I realized maybe that was on purpose.
8676820	8685460	And I kind of it kind of made me feel more like, you know, well, I'm the best damn bounty hunter
8685460	8690980	in the galaxy, I should be doing this, I should be feeling like I'm, you know, gonna attack
8690980	8696660	aggressively and, and burn through these Emmy zones and not be afraid of this thing that is
8696660	8704100	charging at me and can one shot me, you know, and I kind of like it, you know, it took me out of my
8704100	8712740	comfort zone in a way that I kind of actually did not dislike, and then grew to like eventually.
8713700	8718980	But that's the wonderful thing about the dialogue we have here at yyr is that everybody is entitled
8718980	8724100	to a wrong opinion. Occasionally, it's it's fine. I'm just kidding. Well, that's what Jamie said.
8724820	8725620	Last week.
8727620	8731060	Hey, it's a good line. Yeah, it's still true.
8732340	8737060	Now, but go ahead, go ahead. And then I have to I have to get to a chat comment about you.
8737620	8746180	Oh, sure. But yeah, the the difference between, you know, the having to play a different style.
8746180	8752980	And what I brought up last week is that I liked the change in dread because it added on
8753540	8758100	to what I enjoyed about Metroid, the exploration and the action.
8758100	8764900	Whereas with the changes in fusion, I felt that it took away, specifically the exploration,
8765540	8774580	I didn't feel as if I was lost. And, you know, stranded in in a unfamiliar world with no idea
8774580	8779380	where I was or where to go, you know, that that's kind of what I look for in my Metroid.
8780260	8784180	And I, you know, and I'm the first to admit, and I will, you know, especially when it comes to dread,
8784820	8788100	I think we're just going to disagree on the other. And that's, that's fine. You know,
8788100	8791780	we don't all like the same games is what it is. That's why every gamer gets a voice.
8791780	8796340	But as far as dread goes, I will be the first to admit, I need to give the game another shot,
8796340	8799620	you know, and so and this, this happens all the time. And I think we've all had a game
8799620	8803940	in the history, or a movie or some piece of art, or like the first time we were like,
8804500	8810420	eh, and then we go back or revisit it at a certain and just maybe realize maybe it was just the
8810420	8815620	certain time in our life. Or now, here we are in this day and age, it's it's patches have changed
8815620	8818420	the game and upgraded the guy. I don't think that'll be the case with dread. But still,
8818420	8822420	you just re approach the game at a different time. And it's like, you know what this hits different.
8823460	8829460	And that's what happened with Mass Effect, or I think both dark soccer and I and I and dark
8829460	8832900	soccer. I don't know if I'm speaking out of turn, but I feel like dead by daylight might have been
8832900	8836820	a thing like that for you. It's because that game has been out for years. So surely it crossed your
8836820	8842900	path at some point. It was the Lord that got me. Yeah. So yeah, the Lord nerd. And I had been
8842900	8847780	vaguely interested in it before. But um, but I was always like, I will only want to play killer and
8847780	8852820	I will get motion sick. Well, guess what? I only play killer and I get motion sick, but I don't
8852820	8858740	care. And you've kind of figured out your methods to you know, that's why you do afk breaks and
8858740	8865380	playing with this thing. Oh, is that trackball? It is a trackball. I have to play with a trackball.
8865380	8873460	I cannot use a regular mouse anymore. My wrist will start hurting in seconds. And so I play dead
8873460	8879140	by daylight with a thumb trackball or as our mutual streamer friend bourbon says, I play in
8879140	8887620	hard mode because I can't 360. Yeah. So I can watch you I can see how sometimes like I'm like,
8887620	8892500	oh, that you can see that's the trackball. But it's interesting. And I think we have to remember
8892500	8898820	not every game can be accessed the same way. You know, well, you also see what I do instead of
8898820	8904260	when they start to 360 I stop, right? It's then that's what it is. It's seeing how people
8905060	8911220	adjust to those sorts. Exactly. Wait, why? Oh, so you can't 360 not because of the trackball,
8911220	8916180	but because you'll get the turnaround fast enough for the trackball. Oh,
8917140	8927460	so. Okay. Because I would actually have to swivel it around to do a 360. Okay. But instead,
8927460	8932260	and this is actually this actually throws a lot of people off. When I see that they're gonna,
8932260	8936180	they're looking behind them, they're gonna do dead hard, which is where they run super far ahead,
8936180	8940340	or they're gonna spin back around. I just stop. And they run right back into me.
8940340	8946660	That's pretty funny. And I laugh my ass off. And they don't know why I did that. I was like,
8946660	8953620	because I use a thumbtack ball. End of story. Now I said I would bring this up with yyr.
8953620	8960660	And it was a comment in the chat that said, Dr. Sia says, love how he just happens to have
8960660	8968420	the egg rent mini running kicks right behind him there on the screen. Talking about kicks. So how
8968660	8974340	intentional? I cannot be. I cannot be outdone, but everyone's got their arcade cabinets running in
8974340	8979940	the background. This is the best I could do. All right. To be fair, dark soccer, dark soccer's
8979940	8984580	pinball machines are on the other side of that door. So we don't get to see them in the living
8984580	8990660	room. We moved the couch. Yeah. And of course, I'm running kicks on it because, well, it was
8990660	8995940	already brought up earlier in the show. So why not? But you know what? Because I have it on the
8995940	9002580	screen. I can show off one of its really awesome features, but since you brought it up, you'll
9002580	9011140	notice the monitors oriented vertically, right? You push in and then you can turn the monitor
9011140	9017540	just like that. Nice. And even flip the screen like your phone does when you turn it on its
9017540	9023140	side. That's good. But this cabinet has in it a lot of games that were meant to run vertically
9023140	9026740	and then others that were meant to run horizontally. And you can just flip it at will.
9027300	9034420	So it fixes one of the big problems that, you know, arcade diehards had back in the day where,
9034420	9039860	you know, we had games that the home versions would run in rotated mode, but then you got to
9039860	9048420	rotate your damn TV, which is a pain in the butt. Well, what a sham wow moment YYR just gave us
9048420	9056180	there showing us how it works. Look, it works. Oh no. And we'll double your order.
9058180	9062740	What's what's the kickback those mini makers are giving you YYR. That's what I want to know.
9062740	9067700	All right. All right. Nothing at all. Anything else on your mind tonight YYR before we let you
9067700	9075460	go? Just one other thing. So I've been working on, I'm finishing up the mini games for the
9075460	9082020	expansion for super multitasking. I am still working on it. Hades has done a lot of damage.
9082980	9090100	I discovered that game recently and it has definitely cut into my development time as has
9091700	9097860	Forza Horizon 5. But you know what? It's like I discovered when COVID started that I have to take
9097860	9102260	care of myself too. I have to take some time out. I have to play some games, not just work on them.
9102580	9106340	But I am finally getting around to finishing the mini games. And
9108100	9114740	the name of my expansion was always going to be super multitasking versus ultimate versus
9114740	9122100	ultimate because it had the versus mode and the ultimate game set. And now all of a sudden I hate
9122100	9130660	it because I want the final version of the game to appeal to as many people as possible. Already
9130660	9135780	I'm going to be adding some accessibility features inspired by some games I've played recently.
9135780	9140020	For example, when you go into the mission mode, which is what the challenge mode was and what it
9140020	9146020	will now be called. Yeah, you'll get the options. Okay, here are all the different courses. You can
9146020	9153700	speed run them or not. Difficulty. Would you like to play it at 100% difficulty? No? Okay.
9153700	9160100	Then lower it to 90%, 75% or 50%. And there'll be separate leaderboards for that as well.
9160100	9166340	So anyone can compete. Anyone can test their skills at the level they want to.
9169140	9174420	But now if you just look at the name, if you look at something, it's like versus ultimate. That
9174420	9180020	doesn't sound accessible. That doesn't sound inviting. That doesn't sound like an invitation.
9180020	9185940	It sounds like you're throwing down the gauntlet. I don't want people to think of it that way. So
9185940	9192900	I think I know what I want to call it, but I wanted to take a straw poll here of chat, perhaps.
9192900	9198740	And you guys, what do you think sounds better? Super multitasking ultimate or
9199860	9207220	super duper multitasking? Super duper. I love super duper. I'm sorry. Like as a sequel,
9208740	9213620	because the first one's been done before, but for you to come out and call it super duper
9213620	9220260	multi. That's fucking funny. And I, yeah, that's just, see, for me, I was like, Oh,
9220260	9225220	maybe you could call it like super multitasking party because like party, it means that like
9225220	9228980	everybody gets to come to the party and play at the party. But now that you've said super duper
9228980	9234100	multitasking, it's too good. It's too good. And there's also super duper multitasking
9234100	9240340	for matching service ex plus alpha. I might not go with that one.
9240340	9245620	I know. And then I was saying, I was going to, um, I was going to appeal to your, um,
9245620	9251300	Bamani fan senses and say super multitasking final mix. But then when, when you, then when
9251300	9256100	you were talking about the whole accessibility, I was like, Oh, that's like party though. I like
9256100	9261780	that. But, um, super, super, um, I guess, I guess Bobby is running an official poll at our chat room
9261780	9267460	right now. So you can have, you can have some statistics behind your decision, but we multitasking
9267460	9273780	64 says pod culture. Please know we support you no matter what you do. So even if this poll is
9273780	9278980	extremely lopsided, you do it's your game at the end of the day, you do what your heart wants to
9278980	9284820	do. And if you decide to rename the game dumpster fire, we'll still play it. You know what dumpster
9284820	9290900	multitasking dumpster diving multitasking. Absolutely. I'll get my suitcase. We're moving in.
9291700	9297780	So I know that now see, see, you're getting all this consulting for free here. Uh, and the poll
9297780	9301060	is running for those that are, uh, in our live chat, just, you know, you might have to take a
9301060	9307380	look, uh, at the chat, the drop, but you can actually do the poll. Um, fifth dream says,
9307380	9316020	put a tiny super and a giant duper in the logo. I could have them scaling in and out.
9316980	9320340	That would be funny. Oh my God. If it looks good,
9320340	9328740	fifth, fifth, just realize that you can't spell dumpster without duper. Oh my God. Mind blown.
9334980	9339540	And they said unbelievable. They said you're a wizard. Fifth dream. You are.
9340500	9343300	They said word all the way to skill.
9346980	9350020	Why we are, I don't need to add more to your plate, but you know,
9350020	9353620	now there needs to be a hidden button input that makes the extra letters appear.
9357140	9362020	I, I should be able to fit this in the dumpster. I mean, fit it in period on the,
9362020	9369380	put it on the project plan, by the way, actually add a specific level about a dumpster on fire.
9370340	9378820	Um, 89% of the participating dark Sakura's brain super duper multitasking is the better name,
9378820	9382340	but you know what? 11% still did like the other names. So again,
9383300	9387060	you do what you need to do. You'll have fans. 11% of the people were wrong.
9387940	9394500	Stop that. All right. Oh, that's, that's pretty wild. Well, thank you. Thank you for the
9394500	9400500	feedback, everybody. Uh, I appreciate it. And, uh, yeah, it's, uh, one of several
9400500	9405060	things I'm working on at the moment. Uh, and hopefully at least one of them will come out
9405060	9410820	this year. You got this. I know you do. I believe in you. All right. Why we are,
9410820	9413300	I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for the call. It's
9413300	9418340	always a delight to talk to you. Always a dumpster. Super duper. It's a dumpster.
9419140	9425140	Never a fire. All right. Well, enjoy. Take care of everybody. Take care. Have fun too. Bye.
9426420	9435700	Y Y R here on launch radio. I appreciate that. Uh, all right. Um, I've said my mind is still
9435700	9442180	blown at that talent to recognize that the word duper is in the word dumpster and it's all in
9442180	9446100	order too. It's just some extra letters. You know what? You know what word scapes
9446100	9450580	has taught me, Rob? Hmm. You can't spell subtext without butt sex.
9456900	9461140	I learn things. Well, there's no more subtext here on orange laundry though, because I think
9461140	9465860	it's time to go ahead and wrap up for the night, but we can't do that until we go run a gear based
9465860	9469780	final thoughts, but we can't do that until we get to last minute stories. Cause I forgot them
9469780	9474260	last week. So I'm not going to forget them this week. Loki, do you have any last minutes?
9474260	9478500	Fortunately, I don't have anything I want to cover. Sure. The night. I remember you don't
9478500	9484100	have anything. I, I, I know there was a lot of, um, we had some other stuff like,
9485700	9492420	okay, sure. And that's it. That's all right. Uh, thank you as always folks for tuning into orange
9492420	9496420	launch radio, whether you were here live with us on Sunday nights over at Twitch, or you're
9496420	9501700	listening on our podcast feed, uh, through a client like iTunes, Spotify, Google podcasts,
9501700	9505540	whatever it is used to listen to podcasts. Thank you for making orange launch radio,
9505540	9510020	a stop along the way. Um, you don't have to give us your money here at orange launch radio.
9510020	9514260	Some of you do anyway, and we're really thankful for that. All we ask tell a friend or two about
9514260	9517540	the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9517540	9521700	And you know what, if more people want to come here and tell me my opinion on Metroid is wrong,
9522580	9529860	I will give them a limited amount of time to do so. It's always publicity, right? We will be
9529860	9534820	cutting them off at a certain point, but you can have a voice for a minute for a moment. Um,
9534820	9538900	in all seriousness, thank you everybody who does participate every week and along with the show
9538900	9542980	and all that good stuff. Uh, Hey, you can leave us a comment over at vog network.com. You can
9542980	9548100	send us a tweet at OLR pretty much. You could probably send a carrier pigeon to us if you know
9548100	9552820	where to send it. Like I'll, I'll look at the feedback wherever you got it. So, um, send it
9552820	9557540	our way. Uh, technically we have a Facebook messenger account. I just hardly ever check it,
9557540	9562100	but it's there. Uh, you could send a message there, whatever, just let us know you're there
9562100	9567300	and having fun. I hope you are. Um, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9567300	9572260	Uh, we'll be back next week. Of course, do this all over again for now. Let's get folks
9572260	9577700	final thoughts. Dark Sakura. I am assuming you are off to a trackball killer adventures,
9577700	9581300	getting some three 60 survivors. Uh, your final thought for us tonight.
9582100	9588900	Um, I'm still gonna, I think I'm still gonna work on Billy. Um, I was so close a few times
9588900	9595380	and I don't know who I want to do after Billy. I think I'm going to do a Cenobite. I might,
9595380	9600580	I might do him, but still I've got blight out of the way that makes me ridiculously happy.
9601140	9604900	And you can see my attempts in about a five minutes.
9604900	9607140	All right. Well, fingers crossed you get another one tonight. Good luck.
9607780	9609940	Thank you. All right. We'll see you next time.
9610500	9615620	Um, okay. You have final thought for us tonight. Yeah. I forgot to mention it when I was talking
9615620	9619540	about my gaming week, but I put out a new video, which is star of a new Minecraft series,
9620340	9626740	the new hardcore series. So it's an experimental one 19, uh, hardcore series. So it has the new
9626740	9632020	warden in it, which is like this like big boss character and the stuff called skulk,
9632020	9638180	which is basically, um, it, they have these sensors and Shriekers, which detect vibrations.
9638180	9642260	So it makes everything you do in Minecraft very difficult, especially when it's spread
9642260	9646820	along the world. So I have a new series called the deep dark world. Uh, you should check it out.
9646820	9652980	It's kind of cinematic, I guess. I tried to edit it in a very cinematic way. It has some
9652980	9658740	really great music with it and yeah, I'm pretty proud of it. And it's one of the only videos
9658740	9663380	actually got picked up by the YouTube algorithms. I saw you talking about that and I found it very
9663380	9667700	interesting that I guess your, your SEO or whatever, like more people are finding
9667700	9672740	Don't know. Yeah. I don't know if it's that or just because, um, there's not really any one
9672740	9678260	night there. Cause they just did a one 19 like Minecraft preview thing that came out with the
9678260	9685300	alley and stuff. And so there's some of people probably looking at that, but I don't know. It's,
9685300	9690100	it's picked up in search and recommended now. So I don't normally have my videos do that,
9690100	9692900	which is weird. And I get a lot of comments from people going like, well,
9692900	9696340	I was surprised that your channel had such quality videos. I'm like, okay,
9696900	9702100	set. No one still subscribes. I have like 20, 20% of the people that watch my videos,
9702100	9706820	probably less than that actually subscribe. So at it because you're seeing that it's,
9706820	9711540	it's a slow burn, but it's burning and more people are discovering it. So if you get one more
9711540	9717060	men's driver, it's, it's, but God, the water looks so fucking good on your version. Yeah.
9717540	9721700	Those shaders and it's going to even be better now. Now that I can run them like twice the frame
9721700	9727060	rate as there was before. So it'll be nice. All right. Excited to see more. So check that out
9727060	9732740	over at Loki's YouTube channel over at oops, not that screen. Sorry. I'm going to mess up sometimes
9732740	9740500	over at youtube.com slash Loki O L R. Um, I don't really have a great final thought tonight. Um,
9740500	9744500	just that I'm very thankful for, um, the opportunities I've been given this year.
9744500	9749300	I talked a little bit about that. Like my life hosting stuff, um, has come through in a big way
9749300	9752980	and I'm really appreciative about that. Um, I'm appreciative. I get to do dragon con as a guest
9752980	9759780	again this year. Um, and I'm appreciative you guys tune in to listen to the show and, uh, participate
9759780	9765300	and just be a part of it. It's awesome. Um, I think this week Alan and I will do a co-stream,
9765300	9770740	so stay tuned for that. We're very excited to do that and either survive together in space or in
9770740	9775940	dead by daylight or probably eventually both. So, um, that's it. Thanks again, everybody for
9775940	9780260	tuning into orange launch radio. I hope you had a wonderful week and we'll see you again next time.
9780260	9784020	I'm glad we got an almost full three hour show again tonight. We've had some short shows lately,
9784020	9787860	so I'm glad we got a good one, even if there was some difficult news this week. Um, but it was a
9787860	9791540	good discussion. Thanks everyone for keeping it civil and being cool. Have a great night,
9791540	9796420	everybody. Goodbye. You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
