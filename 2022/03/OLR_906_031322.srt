00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Turtles on the Super Nest, Turtles on the Game Boy, Turtles on Genesis. When Turtles get re-released, you can play Turtles every time. Four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games I've played, nine that I haven't. If you look at the list of titles on the Cowabunga Collection, you have a 50-50 chance of guessing 33% or 66% correctly. Cowabunga. These are the Heroes in a Half Shell, now it's time to play.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's time for your fully human hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hi, how are you? I'm all right. I hate time-changing, stupid, shenanigans, bullshit. See, I'm in a quandary. I'm in a conundrum when it comes to daylight savings because I love daylight savings.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I love when it's light out until like eight o'clock at night. I love that because I can go out walking and stay out a long time. I hate the spring forward part because I just want to stay- You can walk in the dark. Because unlike people like me, you won't be in as big of a danger of being jumped in the middle of the park. Animals don't care about any of that. So that's what I'm afraid of. I've literally seen coyotes out by the river.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:30,000
One of my friends pointed out in her podcast that when they do advice for runners, for guys, it's stay hydrated, bring music. For women, it's how to avoid getting jumped.

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,720
I like it dark outside. I like- Then stay up late. This brightness is bad for my head.

7
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,440
Also, Joe, you have to stay hydrated because those women give chase and it can be very strenuous.

8
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,680
That is really actually not funny. Stop it. Techmaster Loki, trying to be funny. All right.

9
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,160
Brian, but it's un-succeeding as usual. All right. Well, let's talk about something actually

10
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,040
awesome, and that is the game playing behind you tonight. What is that?

11
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,040
Freaking love that game. It's Loom.

12
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,560
That's right. It's Loom. It's one of my favorite games ever.

13
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,960
What made you decide to do Loom tonight? I don't know. I couldn't think of what I was

14
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,920
going to do, and I've done Monkey Island and Sam and Max, so I figured Loom would be appropriate.

15
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,040
Okay. I like that. We'll have to get Indiana Jones in there at some point.

16
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,360
And yes, behind me on my machine over here in the corner, correct in chat, YYR. Hi,

17
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,440
YYR is in chat tonight because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

18
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,920
nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network,

19
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,880
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And YYR says, I see something bad in your background

20
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,760
there. Yes. So my Burger Time machine is actually like, it's basically a Data East collection

21
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,800
machine is what it is. So it also has bad dudes on it. So I decided, you know what,

22
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,280
I've had Burger Time, like every episode, let's do bad dudes. And then in future weeks,

23
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,560
we will also see Karate Champ and Caveman Ninja, which are also on, or Joe and Mac.

24
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,400
Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the president? Well, no, I'm terrible at the game.

25
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,520
I am not a bad enough dude to rescue the president. That is, that is, that is that.

26
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,800
S2100. Matt says Rob is a bad enough dude to stay awake after an exhausting week. Yeah. Okay.

27
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,680
Let me address this because I've been talking about it on my socials. Yes, I got to do a dream

28
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,360
show hosting last night, a bucket list thing. We had John Waters in town, and I got to introduce

29
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,240
him as he did his speaking show. And we did a really kick ass drag show after so much talent

30
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,200
that was on stage. And my understanding is John Waters actually stayed for the vast majority of

31
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,960
the drag show and watched it. Uh, and I do know he went down and introduced himself to

32
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,040
the drag performance. He was, he was great. He was such a nice guy. Um, the Queens that were there,

33
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,720
uh, my favorite name, Diana hole is my favorite name that was there. Uh,

34
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,080
I was wondering if any of my friends were there like Apple or mercury.

35
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,680
Uh, no, I think mercury is doing an upcoming show. Maybe. I don't know. But, um, uh, you know,

36
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,560
Don Davenport, uh, drag King. So obviously Don Davenport had to do the John water show.

37
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,400
Of course. I don't know if, you know, um, Queens specifically were Diana whole Bijou Bentley and

38
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,480
Chris front. And then obviously we have nine non-binary red for filth, Gabby. Uh, you know,

39
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,280
so we had, we have, you know, all sorts of people. I know I'm sad. I didn't get to go, but

40
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,840
I had to work. Yeah. I understand. I understand. Uh, some video, some video is getting out,

41
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,880
not at the John waters. That's strictly prohibited, but the, uh, drag performance,

42
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,640
uh, there was definitely some shocking stuff and it was, it was, uh, what you would expect

43
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,000
it to John water strike your local Queens. Yeah, absolutely. Um, and my other thing with that is

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,320
that even though I know I'm, I'm in radio mode now and I'm being very outgoing, um,

45
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,400
and the, so I've been posting nice photos on social media. Here's the part you don't see

46
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,520
the part where I had to park in the hotel parking garage at the hotel John waters was staying at.

47
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,720
And take five boxes of books with 20 books each over to the lobby. So he could sign them

48
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,760
and then take them back to my car. Um, so my back is in so much pain today. Cause the,

49
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,960
yes, I was given a dolly, but the dolly, the dolly was garbage. Like it just, it was easier

50
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,760
for me to pick it up and carry them. Um, so, and then obviously me going, running up and downstairs

51
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,040
all around the theater, like that's the part you don't see the pictures of.

52
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,320
So I wake up this morning and I, well, actually I don't wake up this morning.

53
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:38,080
I don't sleep last night at all. And I think it's because I ate crap for dinner because nothing was

54
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,080
open. So I was like, you know what, I'll go to Jack in the box. Yeah, I'm diabetic, but like,

55
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,800
I'll just like not have sauce with the nuggets. And I'll only eat half the fries,

56
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,280
which is still about 40, 50 carbs, which is within my budget, but it's still like,

57
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,480
it's just not good food to be eating, especially that late at night, especially when I've been

58
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,440
eating pretty decently lately. Um, so I think a combination of all those things, I could not

59
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,400
sleep. I could not sleep. And then of course, what else happens last night? Daylight savings

60
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:11,120
could not sleep. So I'm supposed to get up at, um, eight 30 this morning because I have a dress

61
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,400
rehearsal for clue at 11 today. I called out, I messaged the director. I said, I'm so sorry.

62
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,880
I can't get out of bed. Like I physically can't get out of bed right now. And it's like,

63
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,040
I hate breaking commitments. I hate it. But it's one of those things where I have to step back and

64
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,880
realize what is, what is the greater sin calling out? Because I do feel like I have a legitimate

65
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,960
reason or showing up and being fucking miserable for three hours because I didn't sleep and I'm in

66
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,600
my forties. What is, what is actually going to end up being worth? It's going to be me there,

67
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,400
not wanting to be there in, in full, um, full drag. I'll just say it in full drag for the

68
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,320
role that I'm doing. You may notice I don't have a beard right now. I will just say that. And, um,

69
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,600
yeah. So, um, I felt really horrible about that. And honestly, I'm still really tired. I'm just

70
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,120
pushing through the show tonight for y'all. Um, but, um, yeah, I'm ready. I cannot wait

71
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,040
to go to bed early tonight and tonight I'm going to take a melatonin to make sure I fall asleep.

72
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,280
All right. Anyway, you just described like my entire condition.

73
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,120
I, you know, what's funny is that I was like, what? Cause I've, I've heard of the whole,

74
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,200
like, if you have like a vitamin D deficiency or is it B 12 or D I can't remember, but I was

75
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,960
can do it. Honestly, earlier today, I was like, I need to take a multivitamin.

76
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Cause I was like, maybe, maybe it'll help. Maybe it'll. And I, I feel,

77
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,600
I certainly feel better than I did this morning. So I, I will tell anybody who though is dealing

78
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,960
with at least chronic fatigue, like, like I have to deal with, get your blood tested.

79
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,880
If you find that you've got a fatigue lasting for longer than a week, get your stuff tested,

80
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,720
test your vitamin levels, test your parathyroid, test your thyroid, test your pituitary.

81
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,480
Okay. If you can go to an endocrinologist and I'm just saying I'm not, I'm just bouncing off

82
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,840
of what you're saying. Cause I know yours is just situational, but for anybody who has ongoing

83
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,320
fatigue, see your doctor. Well, and also, you know, I also have the diet and I've been very

84
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,960
open about the diabetes thing. And even though my blood sugar is super under control, it does

85
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,840
lead to, you know, can, can have some issues there, especially after eating like shit. So,

86
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:38,480
you know, all right. Anyhow, I know it's a video game show and not a Rob Vince about his problem

87
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,760
show, but sometimes it's both. So let's get into some actual gaming news. Some big gaming news.

88
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,640
We had a surprise PlayStation state of play this week. We got quite a bit of news out of it.

89
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,600
Loki, why don't I go to you to help us recap the PlayStation.

90
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,960
So yeah, state of play, lots of announcements. So they had a bunch of different trailers.

91
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,200
Um, some of these we've kind of seen some things before some we haven't like, um, I don't remember

92
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,440
if we've seen the deal field Chronicle, but apparently it's, um, kind of, uh, almost like

93
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,840
a cross between like final fantasy tactics or fire emblem or something like that. But it's a game,

94
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:22,960
it looks like from square Enix, uh, the Valkyrie Elysium, uh, which is a new Valkyrie profile game.

95
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,360
A lot of people psyched about that. That's for sure. A lot of people, I mean, that's,

96
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,040
that series has been asleep for a little while. So that's pretty exciting.

97
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,520
Uh, there's a game that looks like it'd be something that I might be interested in

98
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,240
XO primal. It's they're saying it's like a cross between those like Overwatch and earth

99
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,800
defense force. All you have to say it's a cross of earth defense force and I'll check it out. But

100
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:52,000
like, um, that's something that's coming from Capcom. Um, what else can I just say the chat

101
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,360
really commenting on that because, uh, orange is saying, I saw a lot of OMG Dino crisis. Oh,

102
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,160
wait, it's not Dino crisis. And as she went on her mat says the not Dino crisis game.

103
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,800
It's like, uh, you know, lost, lost planet and Dino crisis mixed together or something like that.

104
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,400
Maybe, maybe that's what they plan to do with rival schools. After all these years,

105
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,560
you're going to get fighting colleges, fighting colleges.

106
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,680
I think that's the new saints row game, but you know,

107
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,040
um, quest buster and chat says a streamer I was watching during the announcement was freaking out

108
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,560
thinking it was Dino crisis at first. And then was utterly confused when it showed more, um,

109
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,280
Bobby Blackwell, the chat says you were expecting final fantasy tactics, but it was I

110
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,280
dial field Chronicles. Yeah. It's just, I feel like there were a couple of those announcements

111
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,960
where it was like, we're bringing this back. I mean, where, where was the, um, space shoot

112
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,680
them up meets Zelda overworld Explorer. And then, Oh no, it's not the guardian legend. It's,

113
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,960
it's this, I mean, where was that? Just, just to fuck with us further.

114
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,720
They had a returnal Ascension, which is adding a co-op mode to returnal and a new area. So

115
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,400
there's a teaser for that on yet another trailer for ghost wire Tokyo, which is supposed to be

116
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,080
coming out here pretty soon, like in the next week or two. Yeah, it looked interesting. I'm

117
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:27,440
curious to hear more about that. Uh, for spoken had a new trailer. So, you know, it shows some

118
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,480
of the gameplay this time. Uh, and then of course we got another trailer for strangers of paradise,

119
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:41,680
final fantasy origin, which it's something it's unique, which apparently has a new demo,

120
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,440
but I don't think they're putting any of the demos on series X because I've been looking

121
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,160
for them and I can't find them. Well, the game's not coming out on PlayStation. I think it says

122
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,440
it's only a PlayStation four and five. I thought, well, it's of course, it's going to say that in

123
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,280
the state of play, but I'm pretty sure that's not necessarily true because on, uh, the, not

124
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:07,520
dental crosses, not Dino crisis game. It says it's coming to PlayStation four or five X-Box series,

125
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,720
X and S X-Box one and PC in 2023. Sure. That strangers of paradise was an Xbox.

126
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,720
It could be, let's see here. It says it is. Oh yeah. But for whatever reason,

127
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,560
you're just not putting the demos out on series X, which, you know, I get it. PlayStation,

128
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,920
it's that PlayStation exclusive got to get those exclusive demos that it is what it is

129
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,880
exclusive demo for final fantasy origins and the FESTA, you know, so it's, it's about the same,

130
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:44,000
right? It evens out. Um, what else? So we've also got, um, there was a trailer for Gundam evolution,

131
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,120
which is interesting. That's a free to play shooter game. Um, this massive TMNT,

132
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,040
the cowabunga collection, a lot of our audience talking about, I didn't realize there were so many

133
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,080
Ninja turtle games actually. Right. Uh, yeah. Well, it's, it's also weird too, because like,

134
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,360
um, you know, there's, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game, obviously. And then

135
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,560
there's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles two, the arcade game. So it's like, you can play the

136
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,480
arcade version or you can play the NES version. Okay. So here's the thing, here's it before,

137
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,000
before chat lights up. Cause I know, I know they're fast and furious typing because I got

138
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,800
called out on this on discord too, because I said that in chat, I was like, why? I mean, it, it's

139
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,560
nice for completionist reasons that we get the nest TMNT to the arcade game. But why would you

140
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,200
choose to play that when the actual arcade game is there other than the completionist,

141
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,960
this is my childhood memory and all that stuff. And then I was reminded there were bonus levels

142
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:46,480
in the NES version. I completely forgot about that. Um, but you know what you don't have the

143
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,360
voice acting tonight. I die in on turtle soup. Like you don't have any of that in the NES version.

144
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,640
So I just, I do want to, I do want to point that out. There are things missing from the NES

145
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,360
version that I think are pretty awesome. So yeah, so basically you have a lot of different games,

146
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:11,440
so 13 games. Uh, so the arcade game, you've got turtles in time, uh, the, the Ninja Turtles NES

147
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,480
game, which is super hard, uh, you know, nitro's to the arcade, um, turtles three, the Manhattan

148
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,000
project, uh, tournament fighters for the NES. I didn't remember that being on the NES. I thought

149
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,840
that was on super Nintendo, um, turtles in time. I think it was right in that era where they were

150
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,640
still making NES games and probably they were getting bought more in other regions than just

151
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:41,760
North America. Um, I remember trying to fighters on most people in Genesis game. Yeah. Because they

152
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,720
had that blockbuster challenge thing while back with NBA jam and turtles and the tournament

153
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,320
fighters that you had to do. So I remember playing that that's right. Um, so they had the

154
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,440
tournament fires on super Nintendo and Genesis, uh, the hyper stone heist on the Genesis. Uh,

155
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,880
then I think I mentioned turtles in time, uh, fall, the foot clan from game boy, um,

156
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,920
nitro's to back from the sewers and turtles three radical rescue all on the game boy.

157
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,400
So that's, uh, quite the collections coming out later this year. Yes, it is.

158
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,360
I think, I feel like it's missing something. Didn't they do a reboot on Xbox three 60?

159
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,800
Like, uh, they did arcade game inspired game. Yeah. I mean, that's probably, it's probably

160
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,480
too late. Like I know, I, I know it was on three 60 arcade. Well, there's the new one

161
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,320
that's coming out too. That's not out yet. Yeah, of course that's not going to be in it, but, um,

162
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,920
yeah. Turtles in time reshelved. Was that what it was? Hmm. Um, anyway, but, um,

163
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,280
still, I mean, basically what this is, it's the Castlevania collection.

164
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,720
It's the contract was, was there a contract collection? It was a contract collection,

165
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,680
right there, the classic economy arcade collection. It's it's that, but now with

166
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,200
Ninja turtles, but I think a lot of people are surprised because this one feels a lot more

167
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,760
complete because the Castlevania collection was missing stuff, right? Hence why we got the

168
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,120
Castlevania advanced collection. And I still feel like there's hella Castlevania games were missing.

169
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,280
Um, so if, but I can also understand if you're going to have to go through the hassle of getting

170
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,360
the licenses of the Ninja turtles, you know, cause this has to be a partnership who owns the

171
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,960
Nickelodeon has the rights now. Oh, parents, that umbrella bait. Well, that's part of paramount.

172
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,840
Yeah. So they have to get the license there. And then I guess EA probably doesn't have license

173
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,360
rights anymore. Right. Cause they did at one point. Cause I remember that was the Xbox three

174
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,160
60. They had to go through that. Um, so this feels very complete and I think it's because

175
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,880
of the licensing and the fact that they're only going to do it once. You know what I mean? So,

176
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,640
yeah, but that's exciting. I guess this is Konami's business now.

177
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,840
Just milk in the retro games and collections. I don't hate it. You know, I'm, I'm still very

178
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,760
much like, why wouldn't you just like fucking, well, no, I don't want them doing a new game.

179
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,920
I want them selling the IP to someone who could do it justice. Like why won't you sell the silent

180
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,520
hill IP to somebody else? They tried new games with like, what was it? That soccer game that

181
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,520
they just put out in the middle here, right? Or no, the metal game, Contra game and the Contra

182
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,160
games. Those that's three for three for sucking. So it's like, yeah, maybe, maybe don't try anymore.

183
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,320
But they can make good partnerships. Uh, because that's all this, these are good partnerships

184
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:42,160
is what these collections are. So, um, yeah. Uh, what else? Uh, they had a trailer for Gigabash,

185
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,840
which looks like War of the Monsters, um, Jojo Bazaar's Adventure All-Star Battle R.

186
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:57,360
So it's, uh, I think it's a re-release maybe or remaster or something like that. And then a

187
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,760
new trailer for truck to Yuma or Yomi, truck to Yomi. That's a lot of stuff for 20 minutes.

188
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,920
That's pretty impressive. I have to admit, I wasn't able to watch it live. I had to kind of

189
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,960
get the recap and the wrap ups just because I had a work meeting at the time, uh, cause it was two

190
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,160
o'clock Pacific. So there was no way I could watch it live, but, um, yeah, I thought it was, uh,

191
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,520
pretty action packed. Um, there are two to you and chat says for the record, I liked Rogue Corps,

192
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,840
but, and that's talking about the Contra game, but it had its issue. Sure. Um, you know, and,

193
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,360
and to be fair, you know, Loki did mention a three for three Konami suck fest there.

194
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,960
If we take the popular opinion, you know, there's always going to be somebody that sticks up for

195
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,080
the bad stuff. I get it. But if you go a little further back, just a little further back,

196
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,520
there was that bomber man game that released on the switch. And then that was, it wasn't,

197
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,240
it was good. It was good. It wasn't like OMG, but it was, it was good. And they,

198
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,520
they did a lot of crossover characters with it. It was cute. So, you know, okay. Yes. Konami,

199
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,040
at least in the last decade has made one decent game.

200
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,280
What? Well, there was, I thought there was another, so there was that one Contra game

201
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,560
and I thought they did like another Contra game as well. That was like more of a side

202
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,480
scroller, but I think that was like a mobile game. Yeah. Mobile or the collection. You're

203
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,640
probably just thinking of the mobile game was better than, well, it was better than the switch

204
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,720
game. That's for sure. Okay. Orangewrite does say they did a mobile game. And there were other

205
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,400
Ninja turtle games that apparently were missing because I saw some screenshots of some from the DS

206
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,360
and Game Boy advance that are not part of that collection. So it's incomplete still.

207
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,760
Got it. Sorry. I'm I'm learning. Yeah. Some of the folks that are watching live are like,

208
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,120
it's recursive. OLR. Yeah. I don't know how to fix that yet. I'll figure it out. I just have to

209
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,840
hide my own output on discord. I'm sure there's a way to do it, but yeah, when, when dark soccer

210
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,640
turns off her camera, it puts her in the lowest position on discord. So which, you know, people

211
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,320
are allowed to get away and use the potty and whatever they do. But then it shows instead the

212
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,400
output that my co-hosts are seeing so they can watch the show. So I'll just, I'll just turn that

213
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:24,160
off. We should have recursive, OLR. Yeah. It'll just go into like a void. It'll just be forever.

214
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:32,000
Forever. YYR does want to point out in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network.

215
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,880
Don't forget Konami has continued producing Bahmani all this time, and it's still good.

216
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,680
Actually, they just launched a new Bahmani game in Japan. I'll give you that. And they've been

217
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,720
doing the PC subscription things, which I don't like the model, but people have been buying into

218
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,280
it and they seem to enjoy it. So good for them. Um, I feel like even though I know this might not

219
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,680
be true anymore, I know Konami has re-orged since the nineties, but in my heart, in my brain,

220
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,480
I still feel like there's the Konami there's case set. Konami, what is it? Computer entertainment,

221
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,520
Tokyo that did the home games. And then there's Konami arcade that does the arcade machines.

222
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,760
And I guess that would be tied to like pachinko and slots and all that is the same.

223
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,680
I don't know in my head. It is whether I'm right or wrong, just roll with me here. And in my brain,

224
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,000
we don't have case set anymore. Cause it's not fair for me to say case set is a flop because

225
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,960
we don't have that anymore. But like the, the, the space that that used to fill

226
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,040
is kind of a flop the arcade side of the house doing just fine.

227
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:48,800
So that's that my, like my brain is like, there are two Konami's one is bad. The other is bad.

228
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,520
Konami is bad. No, I'm just kidding. It's but it's, what is bad? The other is, is pretty decent.

229
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,360
So, you know, it's, it's, it's weird in my brain though. Oh, hi.

230
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,280
Guest appearance by Alan who brought me Starbucks.

231
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,640
Come say to the mic. You can't come say to the mic. Alan. Alan has a joke. Y'all

232
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,960
inside of everyone. There are really close inside of everyone. There are two Konami's.

233
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,240
All right. Thank you. A random Alan appearance on this lovely evening.

234
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,440
Well, if it's Jack in the box, it's going to be the shit Konami, I guess.

235
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,880
Can we not talk about that? All right. Anyhow. Let's was that it for PlayStation

236
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,600
state of play? Did we miss anything? That was it? Yep. Okay. Let's move on then. So

237
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,840
as has been a recurring theme for the last couple of weeks here on the show,

238
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,880
there's a lot of stuff going on in the real world, obviously, and it's continuing to go on in the

239
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,120
real world as much as we wish. Vladimir Putin would end this unnecessary invasion that he is

240
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,600
doing. The gaming, the end, a lot of you again might ask, what does this have to do with gaming?

241
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,600
Well, we have some answers for you. Gaming industry continues to respond. Right, Loki?

242
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,760
Yeah, so I think this is just following the sanctions that we that are on the country,

243
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,440
but lots of different game companies are basically suspending business and sales in

244
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:26,400
the country. So Microsoft Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Epic Games, they have suspended sales

245
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,040
in those regions. They've, you know, either blocked accounts or whatever the case may be.

246
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,320
So Epic Games, you know, they've stopped commerce with Russia in our games in response to its

247
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,720
invasion of Ukraine. And we are not blocking access for the same reason other communication

248
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:50,080
tools remain online. The free world should be free and open, they said. What else? And then

249
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,480
we've got, of course, you know, I mean, lots of different companies are coming out. CG product

250
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,680
red came out against, you know, the war. I don't think there's really anyone coming out in defense

251
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:07,680
of the war. But yeah, nobody, nobody is except no one's taking that wrong take.

252
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:14,080
Yeah, nobody is except for Vladimir. Like it's this one. It's this in, especially after the last

253
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,600
what 10 years in politics, give or take. Yeah. It's like the one thing everyone agrees on.

254
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:27,520
Yeah, so no, no Xbox is going to Russia, unfortunately. Same with Nintendo. Nintendo

255
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:35,680
is not shipping any more Nintendo switch to Russia as well. And they are also delaying

256
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,640
indefinitely the advanced wars game because you know, war game during war, probably not the

257
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,960
greatest look. So that's what they're thinking. And that was a little different because it's not

258
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:54,000
like a Russia thing. It's a this reads really bad in context type of thing because and Bobby went a

259
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,880
little deeper on this topic on his show tonight. And I do remember that it like, had like a very

260
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,400
like Soviet Union inspired sort of thing like that part I remembered, but I did not remember

261
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:14,480
that the first game opens with literally that inspired thing invading another country. Like

262
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:22,400
that's how it starts. So it really reads in bad context. So it's not just like war bad, bad time

263
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:32,320
for it. It's like war bad and story really not good in the current context. So yeah, it's going

264
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,720
to be going to be a little bit before. Yeah. And then the join all three Sony has also halted

265
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:47,360
PlayStation sales in Russia do due to the invasion as well. So no Sony, no, no PlayStation, no Xbox

266
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,800
and no Nintendo Switch, although Nintendo Switch, I mean, who knows those shortages keep happening.

267
00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:02,720
So it may just naturally not be there anyways. Yeah, so those know what no more games for them.

268
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,360
And then of course, along with that, we've also got Twitch is withholding payments for Russian

269
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,640
streamers, which kind of sucks. Because, you know, I feel like that that's more of like innocent

270
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,360
bystanders in this case, but it is a purpose. Yeah, it is. It's an insight the public to,

271
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,920
to protest and rebel. Yeah, I understand that. But But no, I get it. Like, you know,

272
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:33,360
at face value, like they, there are many people in Russia that do not agree with what's going on.

273
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,600
And it's and I get it from their perspective. Like it's, it's it seems kind of unfair.

274
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,440
At the same time, there are many, many more people in Russia that are being lied to

275
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,400
consistently by the media. And it's these types of things that are going to wake people up to

276
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:57,520
what's really hard because again, everybody understands this is bad. So if you if you have

277
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:04,080
all the facts, so anyway, so I just just kind of know and I get it and I get it. And it's more of

278
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,160
like, you know, what else are they, they have to do something. And so it makes sense. And it's not

279
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,920
like they're just like, we're just not going to pay you period. They're just withholding payments

280
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,680
for now. And, you know, and I think for a lot of the streamers that were in Russia anyways,

281
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,400
they knew this was coming. And it was not really a huge deal. It was more of just like,

282
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,040
you know, not a big surprise. Um,

283
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,560
one thing I also I don't know if it was on your list or not. But you also had Niantic

284
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,960
because I saw the comment in chat about Bobby had said, the physical stopping of products is less

285
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,160
about sanctions and more about how volatile shipping lanes are. They're worried about

286
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:55,280
shipments getting destroyed. And yes, I get that. But there are some other things like and one that

287
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:01,360
obviously caught my eyes because I play a lot of Niantic games is that they shut off Pokemon Go

288
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,960
and Ingress and I'm assuming Pikmin in Russia, they shut it off. So you can't even play the

289
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,320
games there. And again, sucks for the people that disagree with what's happening and are,

290
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,520
you know, good people that don't want any part of this, but it's to wake up a lot of other people.

291
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,080
I thought this was really neat. And I was trying to find it so I could show it here on the camera.

292
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,240
Because you know, I play a lot of Ingress, which is Niantic's other game. And I thought this was

293
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,720
cool. It looks like it's unfortunately fallen apart a little bit. But this is actually in

294
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,640
Moscow before they pulled the game. They actually did some field art that was supposed to look like

295
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,400
it doesn't look like it now because the portals are showing so big. But it was supposed to be a

296
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,080
little dove holding a peace branch. So you have to imagine like you're looking at like a constellation

297
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,920
I guess at this point, it actually looks like if you kind of imagine you see the wing there and

298
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:57,200
it's actually a dove holding a peace branch. And an act of protest like that is technically kind

299
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,200
of like against, you know, the law, I guess, if you will, that, you know, they don't enjoy many

300
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,960
of the same freedoms we have in the Bill of Rights here in the US. And I thought that was awesome,

301
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,440
that enough people that are aware of what's going on in the situation kind of got together to do

302
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,360
that before the plug was pulled, because now that means that stuck there. And that's an image that's

303
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,800
floating right over Moscow until the game gets turned back on. Well, you want to get technical

304
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,360
technically, if you don't recharge portals within seven days, they they decay and they

305
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,640
belong to no faction. My assumption is they thought that through and somebody outside of

306
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,880
Russia has keys to those portals to recharge them so it can stay up but I am making an assumption

307
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:49,520
there. So but I thought that was a neat act of protest. For sure. All right. Um, any any other

308
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,760
boycott issues going on? No, that's all that I've seen so far. I mean,

309
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,040
I'm sure there's a lot of other ones, but all right. You know,

310
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,920
well, there's another half everybody. There's another half to this. I wanted to get to dark

311
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,520
Sakura for but it looks like she stepped away for just a moment. Let me see if we have some other

312
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:14,000
chat comments we can get to here. Thank you. sjo 100. Matt over twitch.tv slash vogue network says

313
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,760
Russia has been arresting folks protesting by the thousands. Yep. Props to these folks protesting

314
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,960
even though there is a good chance they will get arrested. Yeah. I didn't step away for sure. Oh,

315
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:34,320
okay. I just then let's let's let's go to the other half of this. Russia is encouraging piracy.

316
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:44,400
How so that's it. They're wanting people to pirate movies, pirate games,

317
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:51,840
anything to get around it. They have unblocked rude tracker so that Russians can pirate different

318
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,600
films. So yeah, they're they're trying to get around everything.

319
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,280
Yeah, and some people I think have been kind of very tongue in cheek saying,

320
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,760
well, wasn't piracy kind of already a thing there anyway? You know, not until now.

321
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,720
I think what pirate if you know where to look piracy is a thing everywhere. Let's be real,

322
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:26,400
you know, and again, I don't endorse piracy and gaming. But I understand I have said the words

323
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,000
out of my mouth, that I do endorse piracy when you can't get a hold of the game through legal means.

324
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,000
I suppose I'm now in a bit of a quandary. Because that's kind of what these folks in Russia are

325
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,960
trying to do. I'm not saying I support it because obviously I don't support the war and all that.

326
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,520
And I want people to be aware of what is going on. But I do feel like my brain has divided by

327
00:32:51,520 --> 00:33:00,720
zero a little bit. Because I'm like, I kind of like it's it's a logical thing to happen

328
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:09,200
in response to what Hollywood gaming, etc, etc has done. It's it's one of those things where it's

329
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:17,200
like, I don't like it, but I get it. Mike Defton chat says Russia is taking the do what you want

330
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:25,120
because a pirate is free auto to heart. DJ rama s host of anime co host of anime jam session also

331
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,920
kind of reminds us also included in boycotting Funimation crunchyroll Sony, no more anime streams,

332
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:37,120
unless I suppose they are pirating it because now the government has really no reason to

333
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,200
enforce trademark or any of that to enforce international copyright or trademark or any of

334
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,040
that. So anyway, well, who's gonna do business with that company or that country afterwards when

335
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,680
this all gets resolved eventually? Yeah, I like I feel like the Russian government is just setting

336
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,880
things further and further and further back, like just doing more and more permanent damage,

337
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,040
like it's already gonna take so long for things to get back to where they were. I don't even think

338
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,600
things can ever get back to where they were. Unless there's different people in charge,

339
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,200
I suppose that's that's how things get back to where they, you know, and hopefully a better

340
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,720
direction even, but it's gonna take a big move like that. And I don't think that's coming anytime

341
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,920
soon. And that's why, you know, to circle back to the gaming stuff. That's why a game like Advance

342
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:35,360
Wars, one and two. That's why they refunded all of the money. And that's why they, you know,

343
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,440
they don't have a new date for any of that. I think we just don't know how long this is

344
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,040
going to take. Wait, you're supposed to refund people money on things when you don't have a date

345
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:57,280
when something's going to be released. Looking at you, Tommy. Hey. Oof. Oof. Oof. Roblox. Oof.

346
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:06,960
Uh, but yeah, Nintendo just doesn't know when it's ever going to be safe to release the game. So

347
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,960
and it's going to take this ending, which could be a very, very long time

348
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:20,480
for that to be appropriate. So all right, let's move on and get to our next segment and talk a

349
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,080
little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of things we've been playing to take our mind off of

350
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,240
these horrific things in the world and so forth. DarkSakura, as usual, I'll start with you. How was

351
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,400
your gaming week? I've been playing Chrono Trigger and I actually had a problem yesterday where I

352
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,440
didn't realize until almost the end of my stream that my mic was muted because no one was talking

353
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:49,040
in my chat, but I, but Shane came by. Oh, cool. And we chatted for a bit and some random person

354
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,840
came in and wanted to challenge me to a Chrono Trigger quiz, which of course I got and guessed

355
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:03,440
the bonus point question before they even asked. It was the one about the, uh, like what were the

356
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,240
name of the gurus? And I was like, well, it's named after the three wise men of legend. So,

357
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,560
you know, Casper, Balthasar and Melchior, who is, you know, and he's like, well, that's actually was

358
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,640
the other, the other question because it was, you know, who they were. I'm like, well, okay.

359
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,240
But it was really fun as I welcomed them to come back in and do the quiz when other people were

360
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,480
in there, uh, when I'm playing Chrono Trigger. So that's on Saturday and Wednesday, 8 30 Pacific.

361
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:40,560
Um, we just got, I just got the Epoch last night, so pretty happy. Um, and I'm back in the

362
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:48,640
kingdom of zeal with my favorite music in the game. And, uh, I, uh, uh, of course I'm playing

363
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,520
Dead by Daylight. I'm holding off on Fantasian because honestly I'm kind of bored. I'm just in

364
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,120
that part where I'm too low level to do boss battles. So it'd be nothing but a grind until

365
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:05,680
I'm ready to do the other things. So it is what it is. So, um, I've decided to put off Fantasian

366
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:12,720
until after I get back from, um, from, uh, LA for my birthday. Um, just to give myself like a little,

367
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,560
we're getting, we're going to see other games. We're going to see other games. Um, but I'm also

368
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:25,280
still playing board scapes. Um, it's pretty fun. Um, uh, I've also been playing a little bit of

369
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:32,960
just, you know, pinball in general around the house and yeah, but, um, by the way, I got three

370
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:43,520
adepts the day Sadako came out. I adapted Sadako first day. I adapted, uh, artist,

371
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,600
which I've been trying to do. And I just finally just went in and did it. And guess who else I

372
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:55,200
adapted? This one is, is a surprise for me. You were trying to do Billy when I was watching.

373
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,120
And I was like, that is, I hate Billy. I hate Billy. Oh, you got close. I got a couple of

374
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,200
times. Right. I was lurking. So it was kind of like, there were two hatch escapes on my best

375
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:12,480
games. Oh, ah, damn. But I, I adopted blight. That's hard. Light's hard to control. I played

376
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,880
blight three times, including that game. Oh, congrats. And I just, it got, I got me on

377
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,360
midwich and I said, I'm going to do what I do with huntress. And I'm going to play him as super M1.

378
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:29,360
I got a couple of Russia tax off, which, okay. That was, that was fine. I hate blight. I hated

379
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,240
the outfit. I put him in, I keep forgetting that he drips that crap and he's absolutely disgusting.

380
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,880
And it like, he turns my stomach. He literally turns my stomach almost as much as the clown does

381
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,880
when he's actually in clown makeup. It turns my stomach. It's just disgusting. But that means I

382
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,200
never have to play blight again, just like I never have to play nurse again. Although I am going to

383
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:57,280
learn Sally and Sally is back. We missed her. We missed you, miss Smithson. Welcome back.

384
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,040
I quickly go back to the Corona trigger thing for a minute, because I I'm curious about this

385
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,160
whole pop quiz in the middle of your stream. It was at the end of it. Actually, my, my,

386
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,080
my stream went long because of it. Did the person give you biddies for correct answers? No,

387
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,320
I wish they had, but no, they actually followed me. I mean, there was that. So I've okay. Well,

388
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,640
at least there's at least you got to follow it at least because I always, I always find it weird. I

389
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,600
actually kind of think it's, I mean, I, it depends on the streamer like, and again, I didn't advertise

390
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,520
or anything. Yeah, but I'm just like, I always find it tacky when someone comes in and wants

391
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,440
to completely like say, I want to, I want to play this game. Do you want to play a game?

392
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,880
You know, I don't know. It's, it's, it's weird. But like, if they give me money,

393
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,800
I'm a lot less sweet about they're like, Hey, a lot of it is trigger. How much do you know

394
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,400
about it? Do you mind if I, if I test you? I'm like, I don't mind. I love stuff like that.

395
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,760
All right. Yeah. A lot of it is how you do it. Right? Like if somebody had come in and said,

396
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,240
I bet you don't know your chrono trigger. I'm going to quiz you. And if you get these right,

397
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,880
I will follow you. Okay. That's because I didn't start off like that. They're just like,

398
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,280
how well would you say, you know, chrono trigger? And I'm like, it's been a while, but I think I

399
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,080
know my, my stuff pretty well. And like, I was answering stuff about like the soundtrack because

400
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:16,000
I've owned a copy of the soundtrack for years. And especially since it was my favorite one,

401
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,640
my favorite song, which is, uh, the corridors of time, but not quarters of time. It's, uh,

402
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,080
yeah, I think it's quarters of time, which is the, uh, Enhasa theme,

403
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,480
the one for shallow level. I have to remember it again, but yeah, I mean,

404
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,880
yeah, it was fun. I had a good time. It was also nice to see Shane.

405
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,160
Fifth dream and chat is where I'm thinking with this fifth dream says this comment saying,

406
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,040
Oh, you have a Nirvana shirt on named their top 78 songs. That's that's like,

407
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,440
that's where I'm like, I, I find that shit tacky, but you were right. And Mike Deft agrees here.

408
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,840
It's about the, how it's the, how you do it. And it sounds like it was fine in your case,

409
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,520
but I've seen the cringe. Okay. Like if they were, if they were getting,

410
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:11,440
now I will tell you something that one as a female presenting gamer gets is the gatekeeping

411
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:19,120
oval. Prove you're a real gamer. I sorta was wondering if that maybe,

412
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,000
and that's kind of why I asked what I did, if maybe that was playing into it a little,

413
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,400
and again, it's the way it says, okay, good, good. Because I mean, the moment that someone is like,

414
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,240
you know, prove it. I'm like, I don't have shit to prove to you. Prove to me. You're a real gamer,

415
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:39,920
you know, tell me, tell me, uh, what are all of the, the color doors in mousetrap for click-a-vision

416
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,520
describe the click-a-vision controller for me. What was the first video game system that used

417
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,600
cartridges? Do you know, do you, huh? Food for thought.

418
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,640
What was the name of the, of the main character in the guardian legend?

419
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,560
Huh? Doesn't have a name. She's the guardian.

420
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,880
Food for thought.

421
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,000
Food for thought. You have sat by.

422
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,160
Yeah, that, that, that's what I would do if someone tried to make me prove things. Cause

423
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,400
I don't have shit to prove to anybody. I wouldn't, I would just say, I don't have

424
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,840
shit to prove to you a block. Like I, I would, but I, I, everybody has their own freedom to

425
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,360
respond. Yeah. But if it's, if it's while I'm streaming, I'm going to get content out of it.

426
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,800
So I'm just, let's make it a clip, right? I'll get content out of it. Sure. Why not?

427
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,640
What was I going to say? Words with that? No, I was going to say, I was going to say literally

428
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,640
Darcy, I know we're not quite to a thousand episodes, but I would say between bonus streams,

429
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,320
bonus shows, live events, et cetera. You take a thousand episodes, you multiply it by three hours

430
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:52,000
an episode. You have easily done 3000 hours of content where you talk about video games.

431
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah. Online.

432
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,240
Yeah. And I would ask even a little bit before that too.

433
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,160
Yeah. And I would ask these babies that try to come in and want you to prove like

434
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,080
how many hours have you talked about video games? You know,

435
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:11,280
That's like the people who play dead by daylight. How many hours do you have in the game? Well,

436
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,840
you can have a bajillion hours and suck at it. I am living proof. I have hundreds of

437
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,520
hours of dead by daylight. I still can't fucking loop a killer. Okay. Like,

438
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,320
Oh, I took, I'm talking about the people I go, I've got like 50,000 hours in dead by daylight,

439
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:34,240
which for the record, um, I have 486 hours. I would have thought you had more with all

440
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,760
the streaming you do. I would have thought you had, well, I'm streaming more, but I was only

441
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:44,880
playing it when I was streaming. So I'm at like 300 hours. Wow. And 67 achievements and only one

442
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,080
of them has to do with a survivor. I take that back to the, get out the gate one and the start

443
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,760
with a full load. All right. Um, I do, and maybe I like a boon because I played Michaela,

444
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,720
but whatever I do want to acknowledge, um, in our chat, uh, we have a hype train going and, uh,

445
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,040
I know I don't usually, I don't usually credit all that stuff till the end of the show because

446
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,080
we are recording a podcast. And when you're listening on the podcast feed on iTunes, Spotify,

447
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,760
whatever it is you use to listen to spot podcasts, you can't see the video. You can't see these

448
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,480
things going on. So I don't usually go out of my way to acknowledge them, but, um, because I see a

449
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,360
lot is pouring in right now. I just want to say thank you. Um, thank you for that. Really. You

450
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,040
all are so generous and kind, and we did it stay tuned for the end of the show. I will give everyone

451
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,960
person shout outs after we read it. Okay. Um, let's go to more gaming weeks. Loki, how was your

452
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,960
gaming week? Uh, my game is pretty good. It's got my computer back and it's fixed and it works

453
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:52,320
and that's great. It wasn't anything too bad. So apparently it's funny timing too. So it is

454
00:44:52,320 --> 00:45:00,160
a new to me computer that was built for somebody by artesian builds. Oh no. We've been in a lot of

455
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:08,080
hot water. Oh, they are garbage. Oh no. Oh, did you see, did you see what they were doing live

456
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:14,640
on stream? Let's go to the wheel of yikes. I watched that shit. That was, Oh, fuck them.

457
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,480
Yeah. So, uh, their company's no longer good, which is, it's just funny though, because

458
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:28,960
so this computer is under warranty. Uh, actually with what, with what? Well, it was under warranty

459
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:36,160
when the company existed. Um, you know, now that it's not existing, maybe not so much through the

460
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:44,080
magic though of, uh, internet and my wonderful explet V cam, we can actually take a look at

461
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:50,880
this wonderful new PC. Um, Oh, Oh, getting high tech on us now. Oh,

462
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,880
Oh, Loki got the fancy pants set up now. Oh yeah. So, so it's a, so just to explain,

463
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,800
I'm showing off my PC case here. Of course, got, you got Loki on top there. Um, and then,

464
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:13,040
so basically this is a 10, 9, 10, 900 KF, uh, with a G-force, a 3080 TI, 32 gigs of Ram and

465
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,360
six terabytes of hard drive. And yeah, it's, it's fantastic. And it, it plays Minecraft very well

466
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:27,200
because that's what I've been using it for. Um, because I have to, I mean, but yeah,

467
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,120
so I really liked this. I couldn't figure out what color to make the lights because it does

468
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,600
have all the wonderful LEDs and everything on it. Uh, but yeah, there's the, there's the horrible

469
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,480
sticker. The sticker is on the actual fans that can't take off. That's a magnet. So I can probably

470
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,680
fix that, but yeah, I just wanted to kind of show that off real quick. Oh, also has a dedicated

471
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:53,280
Elgato, uh, game capture four K 60 pro MK two inside of it too. So I could even stream some

472
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,160
games in four K if I had the bandwidth to do that. If someone can clip this for the podcast

473
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,640
listeners. So that way they can see it over at twitch.tv slash VOG network. I did it. So,

474
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:10,160
all right. Thank you for sharing. Um, but, and I love the, uh, Zen monkey 11 and chat says, um,

475
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:18,480
uh, can it pop popcorn? Uh, not that it's fixed now. So it's kind of, it's got a

476
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:26,480
AIO cooler on it, so it doesn't get too hot, but, um, it probably could before cause when I first

477
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:32,480
got it, the AI, the, there was a power cable, apparently not connected to the cooler. So it

478
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,680
never came on. And so I would try to boot it up to like, get things working on it. And I knew it

479
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,280
wasn't working because some of the fans weren't on the screen wasn't on that type of thing.

480
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,280
And so I had to take it to a shop to fix it. Cause I just, it was so tightly cable managed in there,

481
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,280
which apparently the guy in the shop said they did it all wrong. Um, but it was just a cable

482
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,120
that was loose. Thankfully though, the seller did refund me for the cost of the repair. So

483
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:05,200
that was good. And I specked out the PC on like actual like artisan site, which I are artesian's

484
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,440
website. And they have to be overcharging because it, it ends up being like a $7,000 computer,

485
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,600
which this is not, I certainly didn't pay that, but like, it's, it's fantastic. I'm not going to

486
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:23,520
need to upgrade this for a long time. And when I do, you know, need to actually update it, I can,

487
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,760
because it's not a laptop because I've been on a laptop for a while now. So yeah, I'll be playing

488
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:35,840
lots more PC games, a whole ton of Minecraft still. Nice. Um, I want to explain really quick

489
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,840
for the live watchers and this is, you know, podcast people might be curious about this too.

490
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:45,120
I want to explain a button that was just pushed because I haven't seen a lot of streamers use this.

491
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:51,360
So while that happened, Bobby pushed a button. And he and I knew he's been waiting for a good

492
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:56,160
time to push the button. And what the button does is the button creates a moment. So and this is a

493
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,760
thing all streamers, I don't know if all streamers have access to it, I don't want to speak out of

494
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,160
turn, but I know we got access to do this. So basically, you get like, you get it added to

495
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:12,320
your profile, your your collection for the channel, basically that you were here when this epic moment

496
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:18,240
happened. And you can kind of like collect these into a badge. And so Loki showing off his computer

497
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,040
ended up being a moment there. So I think it's kind of I think I think that's a neat idea for

498
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:29,280
Twitch. Like, you know, you were there when this happened. So fun. Oh,

499
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,600
yeah. And pot culture saying I should put the make it orange. I tried orange,

500
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:39,600
orange didn't look that good with least these LEDs. So like, I don't know, I'm not feeling

501
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,640
orange. I had it, it was defaulted to like rainbow, they just kind of cycle through.

502
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:51,040
But it's kind of like too much with all the LEDs on there. Plus, with the way the lighting works,

503
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,240
there's like an app for the case, there's an app for the card, there's an app for the cooler.

504
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,800
It's like there's three different apps, I have to adjust to get the lighting all match. It's

505
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:06,560
kind of a pain in the butt. All right, I don't know. Let me go to my gaming week quickly. I've

506
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,280
had a very busy week with all the shows and everything going on. So I'm not I don't have

507
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,240
a lot to say. However, I also played dead by daylight. I don't know why. But I feel like I've

508
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,720
been playing more of it lately, which is weird because the game. There's been less people overall

509
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,720
playing it if you believe in the things like steam charts and stuff like that. But I don't know,

510
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,320
it's been like when I just need 20 minutes killer cues have been a nightmare, though.

511
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,040
Oh, yeah, because well, they just so they just released the renew chapter officially on

512
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:40,560
Tuesday. So Sadako and Yoichi are the survivor are in the game now. And yeah, a lot of people

513
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,720
are wanting to check out Sadako. So the cute the killer cues get and that's pretty much,

514
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:50,320
I would say easily half of the killers I go against right now are Sadako when I play survivor,

515
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,120
um, which is great, because most people don't know how to player. So I've been getting a lot

516
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:02,000
of survivor points. You want to know what's great, though, is if you are good at hag or Freddy,

517
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,080
she's actually pretty easy. Or, you know, yeah, I was gonna say, you know what I found?

518
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:13,680
I have been playing a little bit of Sadako, I really like her. And I, I got like a 4k in my

519
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,360
first game with her. I'm not trying to flex or anything. But I think, yeah, there are some

520
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,160
intuitive things. And I think it is because I enjoy stealth killers. I really like playing

521
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:28,000
wraith. I really like playing spirit. I like playing those types of characters that can and

522
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,080
Sadako her whole thing about warping to the television sets.

523
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:38,560
Um, I love it. It's so powerful. Like and I when I go against other tacos, I feel like they're not

524
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:45,280
using it. Like it's so powerful all the time because they're usually by a generator it in it.

525
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,800
You're not only increasing their ear meter or whatever it's called that makes them go into

526
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:57,680
instantly killable. It's a curse. Not only that, but just like you those things recharge so fast.

527
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:03,360
That like, you can port again. So anyway, I won't go get too into the weeds. I know we talk way too

528
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:09,200
much about that game. But it's Hey, it's one we both enjoy. So um, yes, Sadako is a lot of fun.

529
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:16,480
I I don't know, I don't get into the whole tier ranking about because a lot of people say she's

530
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,760
not a high tier killer. But I'm like, I feel like I'm doing well with her. But I am also not in the

531
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,960
highest tier level of play in the game. So who knows? If I may say one more little thing about

532
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,360
that. Of course, of course. There's no such thing as high tier killers. There's high tier players

533
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:38,000
with certain killers. Fair. Um, okay, so yes, I've been playing a bit of dead by day. I also on

534
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,880
Friday night, late at night, I was like, you know what? Fuck it. I feel like streaming. I'm back

535
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,000
from date night, Alan. I went downtown, went to yard house, had a good meal. And then we're like,

536
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,280
you know what? I just want to stream. So I streamed from like eight o'clock. No, no, actually,

537
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,880
I think it was later than that. Maybe nine o'clock. I don't know. But I stream for like

538
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:02,640
two, two and a half hours. I did more no man's sky. And I was working on expedition five. And

539
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,840
it was really starting to snowball. I got a lot of like the landmarks along the way just like,

540
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,840
you know, I found that swamp planet I've been looking for. I got through like four rendezvous

541
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:16,720
points. So I'm making a lot of great progress in that expedition. I'm hoping it'll only take me one

542
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,880
or two more streams to finish quite honestly. There's a few grind things I have to do still.

543
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,280
But yeah, I feel confident I'll get through expedition five before it's done.

544
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:32,480
With streaming. I'm hoping Alan and I can do a co stream this week because he's finally got his

545
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,240
whole streaming stuff set up. So I'm really excited to do that. So I don't know if we'll

546
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,160
do no man's sky or we might actually do dead by daylight and do some five together. So that might

547
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:46,960
kind of fun. All right. Pod culture says Rob was streaming late. He was still on when I got home

548
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,800
from work. I was on till like 10 o'clock 11 o'clock my time and that's really late for you.

549
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:56,880
I still want to try to survive with you guys at some point because I need to do my depths for the

550
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,400
two people that have points in Yeah, let's set a time. Let's get one more. Let's have fun.

551
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:08,400
All right. Anyway, with our gaming weeks. And with that, let's get into some news. I will go

552
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,800
right over to Loki and start off our news. Yeah, we talked last week about a bundle through itch

553
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:21,760
IO for the trans or support for the trans community in Texas because of those horrible

554
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:29,920
bills. Well, now we have another bundle that's also on itch IO, featuring $6,500 worth of games

555
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:38,160
for $10. And it's now supporting Ukraine. So you can check that out over there. And yeah, it's

556
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:46,320
going towards the charities International Medical Corp, and voices of children. So it's I like that

557
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:52,640
second one basically helps children cope with the horrors of war. PTSD and readjusting to school and

558
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,800
getting back to being kids. Lots of good stuff in there too. They have super hot skate bird.

559
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:08,960
I Celeste. Yeah, I have to check it out. Um, one thing I like there's a game called bumpy

560
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,720
dumpy or dumpy bumpy. There's a lot of great stuff in there. I do want to point out though,

561
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:18,720
it's not 1000 games. It's still it's still a huge value. And I'm not trying to because it's,

562
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,960
well, it's not 1000 video games. It's actually not even 1000 games because it's it's maybe I think it

563
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:30,400
was like something like 600 PC games, maybe 300 tabletop games, which is cool is awesome. But you

564
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,600
know, it's it's gonna be different. It's not something you're gonna launch from your computer,

565
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:38,560
you got to print it out. But then there's also I actually think this is cool. There's like if

566
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:43,760
you're a game maker, I noticed in there, there's assets that are a part of the bundle that you can

567
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,360
use, because it was the same way. And I don't think people talk about enough. It was the same

568
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:52,560
way with that very important Black Lives Matter racial justice and equity bundle. I don't remember

569
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:58,880
the specific name of the bundle. But what they were doing on, you know, in 2020, over an itch

570
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,960
IO that had a lot of that good stuff in it, too, is that there was a lot of good assets and game

571
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:09,360
making things in it, too. So that is also present in this bundle, which I thought was pretty cool.

572
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:15,680
And honestly, most of these large bundles have that type of stuff in it. Um, you know, obviously,

573
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,360
we love to get a lot of great games for a great value. And these like these, there are games you

574
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,840
have heard of in here. I don't think that should stop anybody, even if all the games were like,

575
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,280
I've never heard of these. You know what, there's a future winner in there, I'm sure.

576
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,720
But there are some I wish I knew how to get my stuff into these, I would totally, you know,

577
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,760
include my I wanted to ask me to get rude in the communities. Okay, I need to probably like,

578
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,840
be more connected to this stuff. But I don't know how to do it. I wanted to ask, but I didn't want

579
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:51,360
to be rude. Like, why isn't your game in there? But at the same time, you don't like nobody has

580
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:58,400
the like, you shouldn't feel forced to participate in that because you have the right to make a

581
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,840
profit off your time and that game that you spent your time. Oh, that's hard work.

582
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:07,440
That ship is a long time ago, but it's fine. Like, oh, in my heart, that's where you were

583
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,080
gonna that's exactly what you were gonna say. But I think to be fair, okay, but you want to

584
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:17,200
I don't know where like, yeah, I don't know where like, I would throw my stuff in all sorts of

585
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:23,200
bottles. But like, I don't know. Okay, so Bobby, Bobby's organizing you the right direction. It

586
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,320
sounds like there are forums that this happens. Yeah. Bobby says they had a thread for about two

587
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:35,520
weeks asking for people to submit. Bobby says next time I see one, I'll ping you. Okay. All right.

588
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,320
I see it. Yeah. Yeah. See, I don't ever go in the forums. So that's probably why I don't see any of

589
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:45,440
that. So yeah, there will be a great cause in the future. Loki participate with that's awesome that

590
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,600
you want to do that. Because again, like I said, you don't have to. I don't think anyone can hold

591
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:57,680
you. You know, you should but that's awesome that you want to. And hey, it'll how many more people

592
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:03,520
will that get the game in front of which can be a great thing. Exactly. Yeah. All right. Also,

593
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,760
the other thing I wanted to say on that is, I thought it was really cool. The itch IO seems to

594
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,600
be filling this void that humble bundle used to fill and I'm not trying to shit on humble bundle.

595
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:22,080
I do. There's a lot that humble bundle has done. That is great. And they have done a lot of great

596
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,000
charity things and so forth. And they and to be fair, they still continue to do a lot of great

597
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,960
charity work. But I think we all know ever since they got bought. Things haven't felt quite as

598
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,440
organic, especially when they started doing that fuckery with the sliders that they got called out

599
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,760
on and all that other stuff. Like things haven't quite felt the same. So it's nice that this itch

600
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:50,080
IO and it's technically it's not actually itch IO. It's just itch IO is the kind of the method

601
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:55,360
of facilitation of this, but they don't own it. It's the community that really owns it. And that's

602
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:00,880
the cool thing. These bundles and these efforts to get it out there. There's an RPG called thirsty

603
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:06,480
sword lesbians. I'm down for that. Oh, in it. That's in the that one's in the trans

604
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,560
Texas awareness thing. It's in the same bundle. Oh, is it Oh, it's in it's in the Ukraine one too.

605
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:19,520
Honestly, there's probably a lot of overlap between the two. But that doesn't mean they're

606
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:26,960
not both great causes worth your money. So as to 100 Matt says I saved my ship for Ziff Davis

607
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:33,120
Humble sadly has to follow by their lead and that that's it. That's exactly it. So it's neat to see

608
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:39,360
that the community sort of fills that whole like gaming doing great stuff space and like the

609
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:45,360
collective power of gaming and all that all that good stuff. figments on there too. Yeah, the

610
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,520
chrono code I think the game was called it was on game pass not that long ago it was it was great.

611
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:57,840
And that's in the bundle as well. So awesome stuff. Anyway, um, sadly, I have to follow up

612
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:02,640
with a way less awesome topic. So we go from gamers doing good to really the stuff in the

613
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:10,560
gaming community that eats a lot a lot a lot of work still. And this has to do with a follow up

614
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,520
to a lawsuit that an IT security analyst at PlayStation Emma Maggio filed in November,

615
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,240
claiming that Sony had discriminated against women at an institutional level,

616
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:27,760
claiming in the allegation she was fired because she spoke up about a gender bias at the studio.

617
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,720
And then in the lawsuit, noting she had been terminated after submitting a signed statement

618
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:38,640
to management detailing sex and she experienced there. She filed the paperwork to make this a

619
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,320
class action lawsuit. Sony last month tried to have that thrown out saying that the allegations

620
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:50,240
were too vague and could not stand up to legal scrutiny. However, eight additional women this

621
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:57,520
week joined the lawsuit against Sony. So now, there are current and former employees. Only

622
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:03,200
one of them has chosen to remain anonymous. So that's very brave, especially in light of what

623
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:10,000
Emma Maggio's initial claim had said about that she got, she alleges she got fired right after

624
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,760
she said about the sexism. So that is very brave that all and you know, the anonymous

625
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:21,120
has their reasons and we are not going to you know, there's we're not going to lessen them

626
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:26,800
because they are staying anonymous. They have their reasons. One plaintiff in this case,

627
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:31,280
has worked at Sony for 17 years and got all the way to being a senior director of program

628
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:37,040
management. And in a quote, Marie Harrington said when I left Sony, I told the SVP and the director

629
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:42,960
of HR Rachel got Godben in the Rancho Bernardo office that the reason I was leaving was systemic

630
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:49,040
sexism against females. The director of HR simply said, I understand. She didn't ask for any more

631
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:54,560
information. I had spoken with the director of HR many times before about sexism against females.

632
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,360
Further in the statement, it reads further when two of the females were discussed,

633
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:06,080
managers spent time discussing the fact that they have families. Family status was never

634
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:11,280
discussed for any males. Similar stories in the remaining women's statements.

635
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,800
Derogatory comments included. I'm sorry, but I think it's important to hear this.

636
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,120
You just need to marry rich. And I find that in general, women can't take criticism.

637
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,560
Again, I'm sorry, but I feel like we need to hear that. Oh, this one's even worse. Sorry,

638
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,960
I got one more. One plaintiff saying on a work trip at E3,

639
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:43,840
I have a lot of thoughts. Sorry. My brain is like steaming here. At E3, her superior tricked her

640
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,880
into having drinks with him at the hotel bar, hit on her even after she declined and told

641
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:56,880
other employees that he was going to try to hit that. When I see things like that,

642
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,000
and a lot of this unfortunately goes back to E3 a lot of times.

643
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,920
We are object and we are not objects. Don't treat us that way.

644
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:13,920
I feel like a lot of this stuff, when I read about this stuff and like everything that happened at

645
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:20,800
E3 parties and all stuff, I know we've talked a lot about how E3 kind of died many years ago.

646
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,040
And I think what we're not saying enough is maybe it's best that it did.

647
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:33,200
And I know for a lot of us, the E3 memories were very different. When I think of E3,

648
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,560
and I'm sure Dark Soccer for you, I don't want to speak for you. Maybe I should just ask you

649
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:41,760
what you think of with E3. But when I think of E3, I think of all those neat games we got to

650
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:48,160
see in advance and getting to hang with friends and getting to network with other people like us

651
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:53,680
when podcasters weren't the laughing stock of the media industry and all this stuff. I remember

652
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:58,560
those fond years. Yeah, but I didn't go to these schmoozy parties and stuff like that.

653
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:05,120
And when I hear about this type of stuff, I go like, maybe it's best E3 did.

654
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,560
Maybe it's best there is no more E3. Because I sit here and I go E3 is never coming back.

655
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:16,000
The ESA is too clueless on many levels. And then again, I hear things like this and I go,

656
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,760
the ESA has always been clueless on so many levels.

657
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:20,820
Oh, yeah.

658
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,780
And I don't think they're clueless. They just let it happen.

659
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:30,420
I think it's all of it. It's all of it. They're clueless on one front and they let it happen on

660
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:35,620
another. I think both those things can be true. Um, Jamie, I don't I'm saying these things and

661
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:39,460
I really should let you have a say. I don't know what are your thoughts when I talk about E3 and

662
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:47,380
all this stuff and and let it die. Let people who think like that die. They should not have

663
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:55,620
any voice in the world. They should not exist in the world. They are relics perpetuating something

664
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:02,420
that is harmful to the entirety of society. And honestly, if I had my way I would snap my fingers

665
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:09,380
and they would all first of all, they would have to live through an entirety of what

666
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:16,980
we go through in their minds and then get locked in the pit. That's what I would do.

667
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:22,180
And it's for that reason that I think even though there's many people out there saying,

668
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,460
I wish we could just go back to an old E3. I wish there's a part of me that's like, you know,

669
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:30,980
sometimes you just you have to take it. It's like me moving out of my old house. It was always you

670
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:37,780
have to purge it all. You have to purge it all. Even when we were going to E3 though,

671
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,900
this shit was happening. Of course it was happening. I'm not sure I deny it wasn't happening.

672
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,980
Yeah, but just back in the days of booth babes and shit. Yeah, that's true. That's true.

673
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:52,820
And I'm like, you know, as far as the video game, you know, companies were concerned,

674
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:57,620
women existed for cute games and selling games. And that's it.

675
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:05,540
And that's why I'm like, take it all out back, bury it in a hole, burn it,

676
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:12,740
and then put literal shit on top of it, fertilizer. And now maybe some flowers can grow.

677
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:19,140
And it's not going to be three. It's the thing is, is that E3, the stuff going on at E3 is a

678
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:24,260
symptom, you need to actually get the people perpetuating it, they need to be taken care of

679
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:30,500
through, they need to be gotten rid of, at least thank heavens, we're starting to finally see some

680
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:35,780
of that accountability. I'm not saying lately, we're seeing some of it now in this industry

681
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:39,460
and people being held accountable for their actions. Well, and, and our things now, you know,

682
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:47,780
with bringing them out on the internet and having lawsuits, etc. It's sort of our current version

683
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:57,860
of putting someone up in stocks. You know, they need to be made public examples of, they need to

684
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:05,460
see that these people who are doing this will fall, will become laughing stocks, they will have

685
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:12,660
the finger pointed at them, and they will be in the eye for as bad as they are. And no one wants

686
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:19,700
to be in that type of position. You know, peer pressure like that is a big thing. If they just

687
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:24,820
either need to learn how to keep it to themselves, and not tell anybody what a piece of shit they are

688
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:29,540
or, you know, try not being a piece of shit. The end.

689
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:36,020
Sorry, when you phrase it that way, I just see your face on Clippy popping up in the corner

690
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:42,340
saying, have you tried not being a piece of shit? Exactly. I'm gonna, I'm gonna make, gonna make

691
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:48,020
that a thing. Have you tried not being a, you know, turd? You know what, you have, you have

692
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:52,340
my permission to use it on merchandise, and you can donate my portion to charity. All right.

693
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:58,340
I'll have to, I'll get, I'll actually get, um, my friend Mustefka, who did my avatar for my channel.

694
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:04,260
I'll see if I can get him to do one of, of that so I can make a shirt that says,

695
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:08,260
have you tried not being a piece of shit? And please donate my portion to a lovely

696
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:11,460
trans women charity because trans women are women. All right.

697
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:15,140
Trans women are women. All right. Um, and, uh, so I just

698
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,900
wanted to say, and I want to, um, kind of wrap up this, you know, is that we're talking about

699
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:25,460
Sony here and this sucks and Sony's taking a beating. Um, it's something that's happened

700
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:31,540
with Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Riot Games. This is an industry problem.

701
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:33,780
Oh yeah. It's happening everywhere.

702
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,780
And so even though now it's this week, we're talking about Sony, you know what?

703
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:42,740
We got to talk about it everywhere every week because it's continuing to be a problem. And this

704
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:52,020
is just an example of that. We can't be silent about it. Silence is, uh, is, uh, uh, what sort

705
01:08:52,020 --> 01:09:00,180
of the of complacency and complacency is entropy. So props to these women for coming out and doing

706
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:06,820
what they are doing to hold Sony accountable for this and all of the, uh, marginalized individuals

707
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:11,700
throughout the gaming industry that are finally realizing they're not alone and coming together

708
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:16,420
to hold the industry accountable. I I'm just like,

709
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:27,140
I'm tired of protesting shit that was being protested before I was born and I'm old.

710
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:33,940
Well, not super old, but you know what I mean? It's it's disgusting, you know,

711
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:40,340
and on top of that too, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna, um, put this out there. Your activism

712
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:46,340
has to be intersectional. If you're going to stand up for women, stand up for all women,

713
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:53,380
trans women, women of color, you name it, you know, because that's actually a really big problem

714
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:58,820
going on in a lot of the activist communities right now is that they're really looking at this

715
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:08,340
privileged white CIS female perspective when it's really our more, our more marginalized community

716
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:14,580
that is doing the brunt of the work, the hard work and seeing very little for it.

717
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:20,260
So we need to uplift each other. Um, some comments in chat I'd like to read,

718
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:25,860
um, as she, 100, Matt says, there will be a case study docu-series, et cetera, about this time.

719
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:31,700
It's about what the industry does after this, that we'll be telling, you know, for what it's worth,

720
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:37,140
um, you're seeing this in a lot of artistic industries in the last couple of decades,

721
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:45,380
because obviously Hollywood with the me too movement has had a huge, uh, trash taking back

722
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:54,020
moment. Me too was started by, by a black woman. Do not forget, uh, DGR mass and chat says I'm

723
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:59,700
legit surprised by this was Sony given how they gave Mick Vic McGonia. I don't even know how to

724
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:04,100
say that guy's name. Cause I just don't care about him. Uh, the heave ho for the sexual

725
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:10,900
assault accusations was turned out to be true. Sony is a very, very, very, very large company.

726
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:14,900
And with that, there's a lot, a lot, a lot of people in a lot, a lot of different roles.

727
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:19,300
And so you may have somebody over there that's making the right decision and somebody over here,

728
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:23,860
that's making the wrong decision at the end of the day, it's the corporate policy and the HR

729
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:29,220
and all that, that really set, you know, it, it comes from the top and trickles down. And I, I,

730
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:33,780
I said that way back when we first heard these Activision blizzard and the investigation,

731
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:38,900
it comes from the top and the culture trickles down. And the other thing too,

732
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:42,900
is that you also have to take into account what business culture is like in Japan,

733
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:55,140
where women are still very much not seen in, I honestly think that there there's almost a higher

734
01:11:55,140 --> 01:12:04,660
level of ingrained societal misogyny than what exactly we have here. Like it's, you know, what's,

735
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:10,340
what's this, the saying over there is that the, the, uh, the bent nail gets hammered down or

736
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:15,220
something. And if you speak out against something you're there, you're going to try to get hammered

737
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:25,220
down. Um, yeah, so I, I think Rama, it's just a particular individual made the right call

738
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:29,620
and did the right thing within Sony where unfortunately there are still many people,

739
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:36,180
um, that do the wrong thing and, uh, get away with it. So I think that was the point I was trying to

740
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:40,020
make is that you, you have somebody that is making the right call, thankfully, but there's still a lot

741
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:44,180
of people elsewhere that are making the wrong call and getting away with it. If I may say one more

742
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:50,180
thing about that, Rob, of course, stop being surprised when you hear about misogyny, stopping

743
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:56,260
surprised when you hear about sexual harassment, don't be surprised by it. It's every time someone

744
01:12:56,260 --> 01:13:01,620
says, I'm surprised to see this happening is the thing that cements it further in my head.

745
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:04,500
That is the last thing on people's mind. They're not paying attention.

746
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:09,940
All right. I'm not saying it's calling anybody out. I'm really not doing it,

747
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:16,740
but it's another symptom. Think, think of how your words do this. Like think of it this way.

748
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:20,820
I know I'm actually literally saying, stop being surprised by it.

749
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:29,220
It's happening. It's everywhere. Don't be surprised by it. Just pay attention.

750
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:36,340
All right. I know, uh, it's very difficult to transition from that story, but we're going to

751
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:40,740
try to do it. Let's go to our next story and try to get back into, well, I don't even know if I

752
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:45,380
would call this happy news. I would just call it news period. It was lowercase, lowercase N.

753
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:53,060
Yeah. Atari did a thing. They bought Moby games for 1.5 million, which I mean, basically

754
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:58,100
Moby games is sort of just like a game archive collection thing anyway. Right.

755
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:07,700
Um, it's, it's, it started in 1999 as a huge database for like video game credit

756
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:15,380
screenshots platform. It's basically the closest thing that exists to sort of an IMDB for video

757
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:25,220
games. Um, you know, basically it was also a good, uh, collection of like retro and pixel art stuff

758
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:30,980
too. So it's pretty neat. Um, and it actually, this isn't the first time it's been sold. It

759
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:38,020
was actually sold to Gamefly in 2010 and it was redesigned. And then it was purchased in 2013 by

760
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:47,940
Jeremiah Freeholtz who changed everything back. Um, and then, uh, uh, they've been running, uh,

761
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,780
that person plus, uh, someone named Simon Carlos has been running the site since.

762
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:59,380
And then Atari basically picked it up. Um, the Atari CEO Wade Rosen said, uh,

763
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:03,620
the Moby games community has played a sustained and important role in the documentation,

764
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:09,300
celebration and preservation of video games and supporting Moby games allows us to give back to

765
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:13,940
the community and contribute to its growth and success. It's important to Atari that Moby games

766
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:18,820
retains every bit of its integrity, and we're committed to supporting this site in ways that

767
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:27,620
improve the experience for both contributors and users. So, um, they also are saying that

768
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:35,220
Freeholtz will remain as the general manager. So maybe it is just for support. Who knows?

769
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:40,500
I remember this was rumored a few months ago. It's interesting. It took this long from,

770
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,620
cause the rumor feels like it was at the end of last year at this point. I mean,

771
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:48,420
what is time anymore in these day and age? But, um, I remember we had talked about this

772
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:53,060
when it was a rumor and cause it came up as like, well, what the hell is Atari going to do with

773
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:57,700
this site? But we still, I mean, now that it's official and we have a statement from the CEO

774
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,940
and all this stuff, you know, I feel like I'm still don't understand what they plan to do with

775
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:06,020
it because they're sure trying to make it sound like we're going to try to keep it the same,

776
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:10,820
which is good because based on Moby games past, you know, they had all the issues when they tried

777
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:16,260
to change it. It kind of went back to the way it was. So I don't know if it's just an asset thing

778
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:21,300
for Atari or what they might ultimately plan to do with it. If maybe Atari, see, I think it would

779
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:26,500
be rad if Atari would leverage a lot of that for some of its retro collections and retro devices,

780
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:31,460
like, Hey, we're releasing this retro collection. And it's all of this informative shit about these

781
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:38,100
old games too. And like all the stuff that's built within Moby games. So yeah, Bobby's

782
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:42,820
correcting me saying it was an intention, uh, announced before and not a rumor. Okay. Well,

783
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:48,020
sorry, my brain can't go back like four or five months. Uh, but it just took this long or whatever

784
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:53,460
to finally go through. So, um, Zen monkey 11 says they're going to make a site to play their old

785
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:58,580
games on it and get history of old stuff as Joe and Hunter. Matt says full integration into their

786
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:05,220
UI for a streaming game service. Oh, I do remember kind of having a thought about wouldn't it be

787
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:12,340
interesting if you go to Moby games, you look up a article on yards, revenge, and thanks to

788
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:16,660
technology such as ant stream or whatever, whatever Atari might have, you can play the

789
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:21,300
game right there in your browser. I mean, it's not very difficult to emulate an Atari 2600 in

790
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:27,780
your browser. It's all just the legal questions of that. And Atari would have the legal grounds

791
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:33,140
to do that. So that could be interesting. Could be. Yeah. We'll see what they, what they ultimately

792
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:39,060
do with it. All right. Now some news that actually is really good, right? Look, Legos Legos

793
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:45,380
are fun, right? Legos are fun. Um, I was actually, it's funny. I went to Moby games to check on my

794
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:49,540
page sites submitted with all the wonderful artwork and everything. And they overrated

795
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:54,020
with all the, or overrode it with all the stuff that was on the steam page. So it erased all my

796
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:58,820
detailed information that I put in there and new screenshots and all that stuff.

797
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:05,860
Thanks Moby games. Appreciate it. Love that the creator themselves is trying to give some insight

798
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:13,060
and it's like, Nope. Nope. It was like, cause I remember I did this a while ago and I had to

799
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:18,260
set it up and everything and I added it and then it overwritten everything. It's fine. Whatever

800
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:24,660
who cares. Uh, anyways, so let's talk Legos. So you may obviously be familiar with Lego,

801
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:30,500
Super Mario. And of course there was Lego Luigi that came out. I think that was last year.

802
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:39,380
Well now, now this year, this August, we have Lego princess peach. She is going to be getting

803
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:46,660
her own set of Lego Mario sets. Um, so she's getting her castle. They have, uh, even like a

804
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:53,060
cat peach, um, outfit they can get and a bunch of other stuff. It looks really awesome. And that's

805
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:59,380
going to be coming out in August. They also kind of expanded with the Lego Luigi stuff with a Lego

806
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:04,500
Luigi's mansion thing. So they have those now. I stopped buying these sets because we have too many

807
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:12,660
of them. My son does not play with them, nor will he put them together. And, um, I just have no room

808
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:18,660
for this. Unfortunately I have not continued with the Lego Mario saga. We had almost all the sets

809
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:26,820
at one point, but yeah, I just can't, but it looks cool. She looks weird, but it looks cool. I mean,

810
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:30,580
I guess she looks equally as weird as all the other Lego characters there and Lego Mario stuff,

811
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:37,940
but just has like a weird like face. I don't know. The face is weird, but it'll still be pretty cool.

812
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:47,860
Um, I feel like a horrible gaming and Lego and nerd stuff fan that I don't have a single one of

813
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:52,580
these sets, but I, you know, and then I see this and I'm like, God damn it. I need to get them all.

814
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:56,420
I want to get them all. And then it's like getting them all is going to be way too expensive.

815
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:59,780
Like you'll have to take a second mortgage on the house you just bought.

816
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:04,660
You wouldn't have to take a second margin. So the thing is they set this up to be like,

817
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:08,900
kind of like a game. So you're supposed to be able to like kind of play with it and like do

818
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:14,420
the scans and stuff, but the game is not very fun. That's the only problem is it's not very

819
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:18,900
fun to play. You kind of just like, pretend to hop it around. It's neat, but that doesn't

820
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:22,660
necessarily mean it's fun. And there's like no challenge to it or anything. There's no anything

821
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:30,420
in it. So the sets don't really always make the best display sets, unfortunately, but some of it's

822
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:36,580
pretty cool looking. Um, at the very least, you know, even like little, um, they kind of like the

823
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:40,340
blind bags that they sell for this stuff. They have, they're on their third series now with those

824
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:46,100
and get a bunch of the, you know, the enemies in there and stuff. So we have a ton of those too,

825
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:51,620
like so many. But yeah, I mean, they're kind of cool sets. I don't know. I just, like I said,

826
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:57,380
don't have room in the house for any more of those. Apparently, it's been successful. I mean,

827
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:02,660
they've had like three or four different, like releases or additional like, I mean,

828
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:07,700
there's so many sets now in the series. So yeah, it's obviously profitable for them. The thing that

829
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:13,460
I really dislike the most, though, about the sets is all of the instructions are in their app. And

830
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:19,300
that sucks because their app drains my phone's battery a lot. And then also, like if my son wants

831
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:25,140
to put together, I had to download the app onto his device. And then he has to be able to do it

832
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:31,060
that way. And you have to like scan the figures in like certain figures that come with each set

833
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:36,100
in order to unlock it in the app. So they won't even give you the instructions without having

834
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:39,540
that. It's just a pain in the butt, like just give you a paper instruction book, please.

835
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:43,620
Yeah, I think they're trying to prevent the paper instruction books from showing up on

836
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:49,540
the internet. But at the same time, they're on their site, their site, I can like I can

837
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:54,020
literally go to their site and view any instruction book for any stuff that they've ever made.

838
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:59,540
Surely, everything is on YouTube. Anything you need to know how to do, it's on YouTube.

839
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:05,460
And you need to fix a tire, fix something in your car, fix something that broke around the house,

840
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:10,340
fix an electric appliance. It's on YouTube, somebody's doing it. Surely every Lego set in

841
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:15,300
existence has multiple people that have well done a YouTube thing is I think what they're trying to

842
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:21,140
do with like the the app and having that all there is they show you how to play with it, I guess

843
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:25,860
they show you like what different things do. And so I think there's a little bit of explanation

844
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:30,020
there. But it'd be nice just to have like the instructions separately, because it's not really

845
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:33,940
that hard to put some of these things together just annoying, like, especially with an old phone,

846
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:38,260
like it used to just eat the battery like immediately because it's trying to constantly

847
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:43,220
communicate via Bluetooth with these devices. And it just was not battery friendly. But

848
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:48,340
oh, they're okay sets like it's just, I'm just not buying any of them. Like they have a giant

849
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:52,180
airship I keep seeing at the store. And I always go look at that stuff every time I'm in like

850
01:22:52,180 --> 01:23:00,420
Target and stuff. And I just have no room for it. All right, well, let's move on and talk about

851
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:04,260
something that you won't be getting anytime soon. We alluded to it a little earlier in the show

852
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:10,420
because it showed up during the PlayStation state of play event. However, for spoken with its new

853
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:14,820
trailer also got an announcement. So good. Yeah, it does look really good. But you're going to be

854
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:20,420
waiting a little while longer to play it, which, I mean, is it really bad news? It just means that

855
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:24,580
they're gonna make the weight and have it be good. Yeah, exactly. Wait, and maybe actually have a PS

856
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:29,860
five by then. That is true, too, to be honest. So like, personally, I'm not bothered by this

857
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:34,660
whatsoever. But I know there's a lot of people that are definitely you know, every even though

858
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:40,740
I am very much delay the game, make it perfect, make it a great game when it releases. I completely

859
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:46,340
understand there are always going to be people that are like, Oh, but I was looking forward to

860
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:55,540
that. Okay, have your moment. Eat your Haagen Dazs. Let the moment pass. And we'll all get

861
01:23:55,540 --> 01:24:00,900
over it together and enjoy the game when it comes out. And remember, this is good. You know, I could

862
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,580
use the good old Miyamoto quote, the bad games back in for Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. We all know

863
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:10,340
that one by now. How about this? Now? A delay was the best thing that could possibly happen to

864
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:17,940
Animal Crossing on the switch in the worst possible way, but a delay was the best possible

865
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:23,140
thing that could ever happen to Animal Crossing for all of us. So something to think about anyway,

866
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:29,540
for spoken originally set to release on May 24. It will now release on October 11. Of course,

867
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:34,340
they don't give a lot of specifics why just saying during the next few months, we will focus all of

868
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:39,460
our efforts on polishing the game and can't wait for you to experience phrase journey this fall.

869
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:44,820
You know what that says to me? There were bugs, there was a lack of polish, something that they

870
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:49,700
found that just wasn't acceptable and they are taking the time to fix it rather than shove it

871
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:55,220
out the door, which I say, good news. And yes, it gives us all more time to actually get our

872
01:24:55,220 --> 01:25:00,820
hands on PS fives, which is a whole other challenge of itself. So there you go. But for

873
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:06,980
those for those that are sad about it, you're allowed your moment, take your moment, throw your

874
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:16,340
fit. And then we'll go get over it, it will pass. All right. Interesting. Mike Defton chat says you

875
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:22,500
can buy PlayStation fives both versions right now on Amazon Mexico. I think it is getting easier.

876
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:27,380
I like but you still kind of have to be there right when they go on sale.

877
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:30,500
But it's it's getting a little easier every day.

878
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:33,860
All right. But I want it now.

879
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:41,540
I know I know. All right. Here. Well, this is something I want right now. Which technically

880
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:44,820
I could already get on an old machine. But I think this is cool. Right? Dark Sakura?

881
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:50,980
Oh, yeah. So you can get them some of the classic D&D gold box games are coming on to Steam,

882
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:55,220
although I think a few of them have already been there under different packs.

883
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:05,220
But we're talking about things like the gold box classics that have the forgotten realms

884
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:10,980
collections like the holder and Pool of Radiance, which I had the big ass box for Pool of Radiance

885
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:15,380
back in the day that came with like the the second edition book and everything.

886
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,700
I wish I knew what happened in my book. I think I loaned it to somebody.

887
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:26,740
Anyway, you know, and Savage Frontier had a dungeon hack and Menzoberranzan. I always say

888
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:31,380
that wrong. The one that makes me happy is that there's Dragonlance stuff in there. I am a big

889
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:38,740
Dragonlance fan. I have read all the books until they got kind of bad. Don't. Yeah. There's also

890
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:46,340
some Dark Sun, some Ravenloft. Al-Khadim is in there. The D&D Stronghold Kingdom Simulator.

891
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:54,100
And the things that it does not have is Dragon Strike, Spelljammer and the other ones that don't

892
01:26:54,100 --> 01:27:02,340
fit into the gold box format. And also, these aren't remasters. These are the original low res

893
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:09,380
same little games. So nothing really has been done to them. But they're the games.

894
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:14,980
So if you want to get them, there you go. I'm not sure they've necessarily aged gracefully,

895
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:22,340
but they're a part of gaming history. And I'm always for keeping gaming history accessible

896
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:28,340
and easily, you know, so we can we can show these little kids today. Back in my day,

897
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:35,220
this is how we did Dungeons and Dragons on a PC. So yeah, I think it's great that it's, you know,

898
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:43,940
at least accessible on modern PCs to a whole new generation. I'm still like, you know, I see

899
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:50,500
people talking about like Fifth Edition and everything now. And I'm like, do you even know

900
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:58,900
what THAC0 is? Did these games have THAC0? I'm trying to I guess around the right time. So

901
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:07,620
all right. Questbuster in chat says easily SSI's golden age of CRPG goodness, that AD&D license

902
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:11,700
was so huge for them. Yeah, I remember these games really were huge. You know, I've talked

903
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:18,580
a lot about my formative years with Commodore 64 gaming. I was probably just a little bit young

904
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:25,220
for these games, and I missed them. But I did get into Ultima though, which I was also probably too

905
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:30,020
young for, but I still was into it, which isn't technically D&D, but you know, role playing games

906
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:38,420
on old PCs. So I but I think it's great that it's coming back. So all right, moving on. I think

907
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:48,740
we're back over to Loki. All right. So let's talk a little bit about active. We haven't mentioned

908
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:54,500
Activision Blizzard in a while. What are they up to? Well, because we banned I actually I had two

909
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:58,180
stories I could have talked about tonight. There was one about Warcraft. What about Overwatch?

910
01:28:58,180 --> 01:29:03,060
You may recall, they have been banned from the show until Bobby Kotick is gone.

911
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:09,940
Yeah, so now they're being investigated by the SEC. There's two separate investigations going on.

912
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:18,820
Whether to that some of the higher ups were doing some inside trading.

913
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:27,940
So apparently, there's been some special like, I guess, some specific sales that they've been

914
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:32,900
doing that, you know, they kind of knew that the Activision stock thing was going to be or the

915
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:39,540
maybe the bio was going to happen. But says apparently, Barry Diller is the,

916
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:46,100
the one of the people that they are targeting right now. He served along with Bobby Kotick

917
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:54,740
on the board of Coca Cola. And then what else also, apparently, the Justice Department is

918
01:29:54,740 --> 01:30:00,260
investigating whether there's any up any of the options treated, violated insider trading laws.

919
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:05,540
They're also separately conducting a civil insider trading investigation as well,

920
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:14,660
because apparently, the three of the men purchased 108 million in Activision Blizzard shares,

921
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:23,620
only days before the Microsoft sale was announced. And then now they're obviously worth $60 million

922
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:28,180
more. So it's like they got tipped off that the sale was going to happen and then made those

923
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:37,540
purchases. So yeah, I think that they probably are the three also. So we have the very dealer

924
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:47,540
they mentioned. There's Alexander von Furstenberg and David Geffen. So

925
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:54,260
I know that name. Yeah, for the record company. Yeah.

926
01:30:54,260 --> 01:31:01,220
Yeah. So but they're, I guess he they're all friends with Bobby Kotick or some people at

927
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:10,180
Activision. And and and Diller said, you know, it was just simply a lucky bet. We acted upon no

928
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:16,100
information. Sure you did bullshit. Sure you did. Because Activision was a goodbye with all of the

929
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:24,260
allegations going on everything. Yeah, shit. I can't say what I want to say, because it's

930
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:30,980
against Twitch terms of service, even if it's hyperbole. I just, hey, you know, I talked about

931
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:35,460
I hosted a John Waters thing last night. Have you guys ever seen Pink Flamingos? You guys ever seen

932
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:39,700
that movie Pink Flamingos? I just want to reflect on that movie for a minute because there's this

933
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:43,780
great scene. I just let's just talk about that movie for a minute because there's this great

934
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:48,420
scene in that movie where Divine she's giving a monologue and she gets up there and she says,

935
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:55,620
kill everyone now, condone first degree murder, advocate for cannibalism, and she's going on and

936
01:31:55,620 --> 01:32:00,180
on and on. I just I don't know why but just like I think it's the impact of that show last night.

937
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:05,780
I just have that scene playing in my mind right now for some weird reason. Anyway, completely

938
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:13,300
unrelated, divine, neatly unrelated. But I just for some reason, I guess I'm just stuck on that

939
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:17,460
show. Oh, Rob.

940
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:19,540
I don't know. It's weird.

941
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:24,740
It is weird how it's weird how the brain works. Anyway, back to the story itself.

942
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:32,660
There's nothing to say. There's like, like, here we are doing our little pocket. There's

943
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:33,780
nothing left to say.

944
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:38,740
We're gonna say it's a coincidence. Oh, you caught me. I did some of that insider trading.

945
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:42,980
Yeah. Yeah, conveniently that they made 60 million dollars in a couple days.

946
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:46,420
Very convenient. It was just lucky.

947
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:50,420
Didn't Martha Stewart go to jail for insider trading? Wouldn't that why she went to jail?

948
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:55,140
She did. Now she's BFS with Snoop Dogg. Yeah, that's right.

949
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:59,780
Martha Stewart's kind of rad. Like, actually, like, Martha Stewart's pretty rad.

950
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:05,780
Interesting. She went to jail. So she went to jail.

951
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,140
Yeah, I know. Makes you think, huh?

952
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:16,580
Moving on.

953
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:24,340
Let's talk about Gamescom. Gamescom. You know, we had a story last week about the game.com.

954
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:31,700
Yes, not the game.com, but the actual event. I almost want to say similar to E3, but in Europe.

955
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:36,820
But after tonight's discussion, I don't want to say that. So I will just say a big trade expo

956
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:42,660
that happens in Europe, specifically Germany. It is going to be back in person this year.

957
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:47,220
It will be running from the 24th through the 28th of August. Of course,

958
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:53,460
precautions is how we get back to having these sorts of events. So there will be safety measures

959
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:59,220
in place for the usual crowds. There's going to be a limited ticket allocation. What they're saying

960
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:05,300
is better entrance management. Not sure what that will be. Digital queues and extra wide aisles in

961
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:11,300
halls. So honestly, it sounds all like things that shows could have benefited from years ago,

962
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:19,300
but okay, we'll take it. So yeah, Gamescom has been digital only. The last time it was in person.

963
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:27,380
370,000 gamers in 2019. I should say because I was saying it's a game show. It's a trade show.

964
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:31,220
This is open to the public. This is an event that's open to the public. The other show spoken

965
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:36,980
about on the show earlier tonight. Never what? Well, sorry, it was towards the end because it

966
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:41,220
was on life support and they were trying to save it. But historically, it was not open to the

967
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:48,660
public. Anyhow, also, something else they're talking about with this announcement Gamescom

968
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:54,340
goes green, where the company is aiming to be climate neutral, talking about a reduction in

969
01:34:54,340 --> 01:35:02,900
avoidance of CO2 emissions and short term issues through carbon offsetting. A random thing to throw

970
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:08,100
in there without specifics, but okay, sure. Keeping climate responsibility in mind is a

971
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:13,220
good thing. So I can't complain about that. For the rest of us that do not plan to go to this

972
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:20,100
show, because that's a bit too far to travel, or whatever reason you have, Gamescom's opening night

973
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:25,460
live will be back. And assumably, that means Jeff Keighley as well, although we don't have the

974
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:31,780
details and the date and all that stuff just yet. But I'm sure we will get all that in the not too

975
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:42,500
distant future. Forward to it. All right. I think what we will do now is take a moment to reflect

976
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:48,020
on a simpler time in the segment that we like to do here every week, and I'll roll the bumper for

977
01:35:48,020 --> 01:36:04,340
it. And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out

978
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:12,660
a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the Classic Game of the Week. And Dark Soccer,

979
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:16,340
what did you pick for the Classic Game of the Week this week?

980
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:25,700
I picked Carnival. Carnival is a... Well, it may not be the most exciting game,

981
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:34,580
but I was seriously trying to think of like... I was actually sort of in a Colecovision nostalgia

982
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:41,060
mood. And so I picked a game that we used to play a lot when I was a kid,

983
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:45,620
which of course was Carnival. And I had never played it in the arcade at the time. We just

984
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:52,260
had it on Colecovision. It was a fixed shooter developed by a company called Gremlin and released

985
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:59,940
by Sega in arcades in 1980. It was one of the first video games that had a bonus round.

986
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:08,180
It was ported to Atari 2600, Colecovision, and Intellivision by Coleco. There's a licensed Atari

987
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:14,820
8-bit family version that was published in 1982 by Analog Software, which was a commercial software

988
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:21,540
label for Analog Computing magazine. Acornsoft also did a copy in 1983 for the BBC Micro.

989
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:30,260
So the goal of the game... Now, you have limited ammo. You have to last and shoot things as long

990
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:37,540
as you can. So you basically just have to aim and shoot. And sometimes you can get things that give

991
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:45,700
you bonus bullets. But you have three rows of targets. And then you also have a circle in the

992
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:52,020
center that's got like a pipe wheel on and you shoot the pipes off. Now, you also for your

993
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:59,060
different targets, you have rabbits, ducks, owls, the extra bullet targets. And of course, if you

994
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:05,860
hit something on the higher row, it's worth more points. If a duck reaches the bottom row without

995
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:12,900
being shot, it's going to come fly at you. It's like, come at me, bro. I'll shoot you. You duck.

996
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:21,780
Anyway, you also have pop-up targets above the top row that can either give you awards or can

997
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:27,620
actually take bullets or points when you hit it. So you have to be careful. And that pipe wheel has

998
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:34,180
eight pipes that are in the top one. Each of the points of the value decreases for every shot that

999
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:41,780
does not hit one of them. So your bonus counter increases in value with every target shot in the

1000
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:48,740
three rows. And you can collect it by shooting the letters of the word BONUS in order as they

1001
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:55,300
cycle through those rows. It stops increasing anytime you hit any letter out of order.

1002
01:38:56,260 --> 01:39:02,740
So the round will end when all the targets or the pipes have been shot. You get your bonus points

1003
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:07,860
for unused bullets, and then you play a bonus round with a large bear that goes back and forth.

1004
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:12,420
Each time the bear is shot, it rears up and goes the other way. So you have to shoot that bear as

1005
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:18,100
many times as possible until it escapes off of the screen with your limited ammo. After that,

1006
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:25,540
then you get the next wave, and every bonus round adds another bear to the screen up to a maximum of

1007
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:32,260
four. So, you know, of course the higher levels give you higher point values, more ducks,

1008
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:38,900
fewer extra bullets, faster moving targets, and the increased rate of ducks that come on,

1009
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:46,100
and the game will be over when you have exhausted your ammunition supply or you've been eaten by

1010
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:55,300
ducks. How many games do you know where you get eaten by ducks? Just saying. So it's one of those

1011
01:39:55,300 --> 01:40:01,540
few games that has two different PCBs. There's two different versions. So normally a game has

1012
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:10,580
one PCB with dip switch sets that either switch it to upright or cocktail. And with this one,

1013
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:15,700
it had the upright and cocktail cabinets had those two varieties, one in wood grain and the

1014
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:22,660
other painted orange and white. The tune that plays is, I hope I don't mispronounce this,

1015
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:33,860
Sobre la Solas by Juventito Rosas. It's the song you hear at carnivals. That one, you know?

1016
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:35,140
Oh, yeah.

1017
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:46,500
And the chip though that it used was a general instrument AY-38910 chip. So it was actually

1018
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:52,100
fairly complex when it allowed for a complex rendition of that waltz at the time, and it

1019
01:40:52,180 --> 01:41:01,460
allowed for the overlaid sound effects. So it was fairly nice for 1980. The Cliccovision port

1020
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:09,540
was basically considered to be perfect, like a perfect rendition. And I did find a lot of times

1021
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:16,260
that Cliccovision games were pretty spot on, maybe not perfect, you know? And the things that they

1022
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:24,980
did when they would do a port would help replace the things that you would have otherwise missed.

1023
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:31,300
Does that make sense? Like for Space Fury, instead of having like the weird robot voice,

1024
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:39,300
it actually sang kind of like in the background. It was kind of neat. But anyway, in a discussion

1025
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:47,700
of the arcade games music is that, in fact, there's a quote by a video game scholar on here.

1026
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:54,020
This is, and I'm going to quote, as the track makes use of all three tone channels using two

1027
01:41:54,020 --> 01:42:01,220
for the waltz characteristic umpapa, you know, thing and one for the melody. The resulting texture

1028
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:06,260
is rich enough to do the music justice and the inclusion of numerous sound effects, including

1029
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:14,020
three different duck quacks and a bear roar makes for a veritable sonic feast. Again, 1980. But

1030
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:22,260
it's pretty, pretty much, you know, a testament. This game is still a challenge. I have this game

1031
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:27,780
still. I have my, I have two Cliccovisions. And this is to this day, one of my favorite,

1032
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:35,380
favorite games for the Cliccovision. One thing that I will say about it, though, is that

1033
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:39,700
on the Cliccovision version, I don't know if it did in the arcade. Cause like I said,

1034
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:45,140
I hadn't played the arcade one is that the music would just stop.

1035
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:51,460
And then you'd be playing in silence, the little sound effects. So that was like,

1036
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:56,260
we'll just sit here in silence and think about what we've done. All these poor ducks were shooting

1037
01:42:57,380 --> 01:43:03,300
poor ducks, my ass. They're trying to eat you. Like you see though, and like in the sample here,

1038
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:10,260
like trying to hit the bonus, that shit was hard. That shit was hard. And the ducks are assholes.

1039
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:15,140
Well, and also we used to think about that mechanic where like, you know, and I'm sorry

1040
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:20,020
for the podcast listeners, but you can see it kind of flashing on the screen, the minus bullets and

1041
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:25,140
stuff. So like if you don't connect with a target on the side and your bullet goes all the way to

1042
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:29,140
the top, you actually are going to get a huge penalty for that. You see, you really have to

1043
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:33,940
when you're shooting the pies. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's, it's mechanic.

1044
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:38,100
And this person on this particular example, I don't know that they were trying to hit the

1045
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:42,900
pipe from the other side because the pipes were easier to hit when they were coming down.

1046
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:52,100
But anyway, it's, it's just one of those fun little games. Like I would put it up as one of

1047
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:58,420
my favorite Coleco vision games. And the only two games that I would probably put above that would

1048
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:04,500
be, I don't know, I guess maybe it's like my number five favorite Coleco vision. Cause I put

1049
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:12,580
Gorf as number one followed by venture. After that would be space fury.

1050
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:19,300
Actually I take that back. Mouse trap would be above space fury, then space fury and then

1051
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:23,220
carnival. I love space fury.

1052
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:28,660
Space for so good. I mean, it's really just like asteroids plus, you know,

1053
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:31,940
I remember this game and I wasn't even a Coleco for, there must've been a version on

1054
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:35,940
Commodore 64 at some point. Cause I remember playing this or maybe I played it in the arcade,

1055
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:40,100
honestly. I probably played it in the arcade. Well, I mean, but they were also doing all

1056
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:45,620
those different ports, unofficial ports for, uh, uh, Commodore 64.

1057
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:47,860
That's probably what I played. I probably just played a knockoff,

1058
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:53,140
um, but still, um, no, there was a game called world cup carnival,

1059
01:44:53,700 --> 01:45:02,020
but not an official release of carnival. Well, uh, a great, there was a, uh, a Muppet,

1060
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:08,260
uh, at the carnival. That's there really? That's kind of fun. All right. Well,

1061
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:15,140
there it is your classic game of the week carnival, which, um, yeah,

1062
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:20,100
I don't know what else to say about it. Uh, it's it, I mean, it's something that I played

1063
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:26,180
and I enjoyed. Um, it is, it is simple. It maybe hasn't aged well in the graphics and

1064
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:31,540
all that department, but, um, I think a classic game. It's challenging to me. Yeah. It's,

1065
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:37,620
it is challenging. There's interesting mechanics in it for what it is like a silly emulation of

1066
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:45,060
a carnival game, the pipe mechanic, unique, the rotating bonus or penalty unique. Uh, there,

1067
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:50,500
there, it has these interesting spins on it. Target shooting games like that anymore. No,

1068
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:55,220
no. Well, well, you want to talk about a real classic. I miss point blank. That was like,

1069
01:45:55,220 --> 01:46:02,340
that game is so awesome. Point blank is a bunch of shooting mini games. I know. And I love it.

1070
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:08,900
I guess so this, this one. Well, I mean, we still have the, the gun cons.

1071
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:16,100
So for our place, I want a VR point blank, shout out, shout out if he's still in chat because YYR

1072
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:21,460
did make that sharp shooter game that is very inspired by that point blank stuff. So I,

1073
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:25,700
I should, someone's still making them, but yeah. Yeah. For the most part, I would,

1074
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:33,380
I would kill for a point blank VR game for sure. All right. Thank you for the pick and walk down

1075
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:39,380
memory lane. Good carnivals. Definitely it, you know, and you know, I actually, um, who knows,

1076
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:45,860
maybe I'll bust out the clique of vision and try to get it set up. Right. Oh good. YYR is present

1077
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:50,340
to hear the shout out. Fantastic. Thank you. And check it out on steam. Sharp shooter. Plus,

1078
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:56,900
excuse me. I forgot the plus. Um, YYR in chat says the only bummer regarding VR shooting games is

1079
01:46:56,900 --> 01:47:03,380
how would you play two players? Um, well, I mean, you can play through the power of the metaverse.

1080
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:12,900
Shut up the internet. Um, yeah, it would have to be an internet thing. All right. Uh, let's move on

1081
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:17,860
around the internet and talk about some other rapid fire, uh, news around the industry and

1082
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:26,900
Loki will start with you. Don't make me more upset. So good news. Super Nintendo world is

1083
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:34,740
opening next year in Hollywood. Great news. I'll take it. How much is it going to cost me? That's

1084
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:41,940
the bad news. It'll cost you admission to universal studios, Hollywood, which is probably double next

1085
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:49,220
year. We'll see. Yeah, we'll see. Studio Hollywood. We talk a lot about Disneyland

1086
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:53,620
here on this show. And yes, Disney has a lot of great stuff. I like universal studios. I think

1087
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:58,260
they, I, I realized some people do not like their rides as much. I like what they do with the rides.

1088
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:06,980
I think they're really immersive and never been really been a long time should go. We should all

1089
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:10,740
go. Would you want to go dark soccer? I mean, if it's like, I don't go, cause I don't want to go.

1090
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:17,620
I would want to, I would want to go. Um, you know, it's just, I'm basically using my vacation time

1091
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:25,220
for, for my Disneyland trip. Gotcha. Gotcha. Also, you know, it might be adverse to a certain

1092
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:31,700
world that is also adjacent. I hate it because obviously I cannot stand her and that's all I'm

1093
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:37,700
using her period. Um, but actually, no, I shouldn't say it because her, the musician is fantastic,

1094
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:43,060
but we all know that is not who I'm talking about. And yes, uh, she has that little wizard

1095
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:48,260
place at the park. Here's the problem. That actually is a fantastic environment before

1096
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:56,340
she got a Twitter account. That was a fantastic environment. And the ride is astronomically fun.

1097
01:48:56,340 --> 01:49:01,780
And the butter beer is fantastic. And I feel like nothing she says or does can take that away,

1098
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:09,060
but I, I am well aware that it is the more that when she continues to make even one penny

1099
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:15,540
off of that and use that voice to do what she does, it makes us all a little bit skittish.

1100
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:21,940
And I get it, but it sucks because otherwise Harry Potter is done with it. It's fantastic.

1101
01:49:22,660 --> 01:49:29,460
Can like Harry Potter kind of continue on in the equivalent of like how the Connors continued on

1102
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:36,340
after that whole thing. Like it's, Oh my God. Brilliant. Brilliant. I mean, yes.

1103
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:41,220
Can't we just get the Connors version of that park? Brilliant. Exactly.

1104
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:45,380
My God, I love it. Harry hotter.

1105
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:54,820
Uh, and then in other news, uh, God of War is rumored to be gaining a TV series adaptation.

1106
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:57,700
Sure. Why not? All of them are so, you know, it makes sense.

1107
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:03,540
You know, it's funny in this, that we're in this timeline now where there's actually

1108
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:08,740
good adaptations of gaming things. Who would have thought that, I guess eventually that they would

1109
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:14,820
have to do it right at some point. Uh, we're still waiting for like, well, maybe mixed feelings on

1110
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:19,940
the uncharted one, but, um, you know, Sonic the Hedgehog is great. Pokemon was great.

1111
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:26,340
Um, you know, TV series wise, I'm sure the last of us is going to be pretty amazing.

1112
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:34,420
Um, I really want to see the prominent tears. I want to see fallout. That'd be good. And then

1113
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:41,300
Bioshock the, the show. Oh yes, please. We're just getting so like, we are getting

1114
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:46,420
these video games shows delivered. And I mean, obviously we have the Witcher, I think is a huge

1115
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:51,540
part to thank for that. Oh yeah. Absolutely. The anime stuff too, like Castlevania ending up,

1116
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:56,660
you know? Yeah. Yeah. And then, uh, what was the arcane? I haven't seen it yet, but I've only

1117
01:50:56,660 --> 01:51:02,180
heard like amazing things about it. So, yeah. Oh yeah. Tired on chat says, let's not forget

1118
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:06,500
mass effect. Let's not, because it's great that that's back on the agenda too. Cause I remember

1119
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,860
they were going to do a movie and I guess they decided a TV show works better, which is the

1120
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:20,180
right decision. I like the animated thing that had a, um, Vega. Yeah. Like the side story. Yeah.

1121
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:26,260
It was really good. So apparently this is in talks with Amazon studios and it's been,

1122
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:33,380
uh, apparently the rumors that, uh, Mark Fergus and a hocked OSPI they're known for the expanse

1123
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:38,180
and children of men are involved in the project. Otherwise we don't really know

1124
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:42,580
more details about it yet, but maybe we'll hear something. If it becomes a thing.

1125
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:46,500
I remember seeing that children have been movie. That was Julia. Julia Moore was in that. That was

1126
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:56,100
a dark movie. Okay. Wow. Right. It'll be boys. They'll they'll put, they'll put this next to

1127
01:51:56,100 --> 01:52:02,500
the boys. It'll be boy, you know, boy and the boys. It works. Do what you do. All right.

1128
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:08,580
Dark soccer. What do you have for us in rapid fire news? Well, um, there, uh, remember before

1129
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:14,260
I was talking about the Tokimeki Memorial translation? Well, it's out now. Um, it is

1130
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:21,060
a patch for Tokimeki Memorial under the tree of legends. Um, which is the PC engine version.

1131
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:26,740
It has the intro in there along with the, uh, English lyrics to sing along and the ending song,

1132
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:33,460
the confession scenes are voiced and it's ready to go. So, um, of course, uh,

1133
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:42,820
it, it does have some limitations, but it's available. Um, you can, uh, go find the,

1134
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:52,260
uh, translation patch at, uh, translated.games slash SNES slash heartthrob.

1135
01:52:54,900 --> 01:53:03,380
And then in other news, um, one of my favorite games kicks, uh, which is basically where you

1136
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:15,220
have to, uh, trap some lines in a box, uh, title game. Um, it actually is, uh, uh, being added to

1137
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:22,660
the arcade archives. Um, so yeah, I'm looking forward to it. Where's my arcade. Where's my

1138
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:31,940
arcade archives for gals panic. Everybody. It's the same. That's a different game. We need,

1139
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:38,340
we need our key archives for that game too. Yeah, no, I, um, you know, I have to send some cards

1140
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:43,780
and letters and angry tweets, uh, to get what you need. I guess kicks is pretty awesome. I'm,

1141
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:50,820
I'm with dark soccer. It's, it's a arcade classic. Uh, well, it's, it's funny. You bring up

1142
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:56,340
those particular games because they, those games are kicks basically like Ms. New World,

1143
01:53:57,300 --> 01:54:02,340
it's kicks. They're all kicks clones. So it's it. Okay. Maybe, maybe you had a layered joke there

1144
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:07,780
that went over my head at first, but, um, that is, uh, yeah. I mean, kicks is really the reason

1145
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:14,660
for all that other stuff. So, all right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some games.

1146
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:20,260
We'll be playing a lot sooner, uh, than arcade archives, Ms. New World 96. Uh, let's go to the

1147
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:26,500
U S first. Uh, we've got the cruel King and the great hero on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four

1148
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:32,100
Dawn of the monsters on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five,

1149
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:38,420
Xbox one and Xbox series. Wow. You know, I didn't think that this would happen,

1150
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:42,740
but we're getting new grand theft auto games, grand theft auto online,

1151
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:48,340
which I think is now its own separate thing as well. Uh, that's coming out for PlayStation

1152
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:54,900
five and Xbox series X, and then grant the thought of five, the brand new game from rockstar,

1153
01:54:55,620 --> 01:55:02,020
not a game that's been out for almost, I think it can be a classic game of the week at this point.

1154
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:09,380
Um, that is on PlayStation five and Xbox series X this week as well. Uh, Phantom breaker, um,

1155
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:14,820
uh, or Omni, I guess that's what it is. Um, that's on PC, Nintendo switch,

1156
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:20,180
PlayStation four and Xbox one. Oh, a game I've been waiting for, for a while actually tunic

1157
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:29,700
that's coming out on PC and Mac and Xbox one and Xbox series. Uh, we have anno mutinium,

1158
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:37,860
uh, that's on PC, PlayStation four and PlayStation five. Uh, I guess this is a close to my,

1159
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:42,900
you know, want for a gals panic game, but we have gal gun double pieces coming in,

1160
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:50,100
Nintendo switch, uh, persona for arena Ultimax on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four

1161
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:57,860
shredders, not the ninja Charles thing, but it's a snowboarding game that's on PC and Xbox series,

1162
01:55:58,820 --> 01:56:04,580
strangers of paradise, final fantasy origin. Woo boy. It's out this week on PC,

1163
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:11,460
PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. And last but not least Siberia,

1164
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:18,020
the world before that's on PC. All right, let's go to Japan and check out the releases there on

1165
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:22,660
the Nintendo switch this week on March 17th. It might be St. Patrick's day over here. Uh,

1166
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:26,740
but in Japan they get released. Gal gun double piece is also out in Japan.

1167
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:34,020
Persona four arena Ultimax is also out, uh, a game call called Senran Nin Ninja,

1168
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:42,420
Tyson Neptune. Shoujo tai chi no kyuen is out. Uh, it's from compile hearts and I'm trying to

1169
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:48,740
figure out what it is. It looks like it's, Oh, it's, um, okay. It's a Neptunia and Senran Kagura

1170
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:54,500
crossover. So it's those two series. It's one RPG with both, um, those kind of like, uh, worlds in

1171
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:59,700
them. It's kind of neat. I think some people will be into that. Uh, and, uh, let's see what else on

1172
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:03,460
the switch. I guess that's it for the switch. So let me check the PlayStation five. Yeah. I was

1173
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:08,740
pretty sure I'd see stranger of paradise, final fantasy origin also out in Japan this week. You

1174
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:13,940
know, I, at first I didn't think I really wanted to play that game, but the more I hear about it

1175
01:57:13,940 --> 01:57:18,100
and the more people are kind of reacting to the demo and stuff, I'm like, I kinda, I might have

1176
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:25,140
to try it. Like I just dropped 60 bucks on it. You know, is it like a beat him up game? Like what is

1177
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:31,940
it? They're saying it's like a team Ninja. Yeah. It's like a souls ask type. Really?

1178
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:38,660
It's team Ninja doing the soul. Yeah, I know. Well, not, not literally like, you know,

1179
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:44,900
everything is, you know? Um, so I wanna, I wanna try the demo at some point. Um, but except they

1180
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:49,140
won't put it on a Xbox for whatever reason, but I'll have to watch live streams or something to

1181
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:54,180
truly get a sense if I really want it. Here's the thing. I didn't talk about this during my

1182
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:57,540
gaming week. Cause I didn't actually play the game, but I need a moment before we get to our

1183
01:57:57,540 --> 01:58:04,340
next segment and sorry, the UK dates. I just need one moment to talk about chocobo GP because that

1184
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:11,780
came out on the switch and I down Loki's face palming already. Um, Oh, sweet. Rama says the

1185
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:15,940
demo is out on Xbox. Oh, I didn't see it in the app. Okay. I'm going to, I'll grab it. Rama. Yay.

1186
01:58:15,940 --> 01:58:23,220
Thank you for the heads up. Um, but chocobo GP. Apparently they, I, from what I am understanding,

1187
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:29,460
most people that did the early reviews of the game did not know the extent of which there is

1188
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:34,820
like premium currency and gotcha mechanics in the game, because I guess they didn't really unlock

1189
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:40,100
all of that until the game was released. And I'm sorry, but that is fucking dirty. That's just

1190
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:44,980
straight up dirty to hide that stuff. And again, I don't have a full sense of it. So if I'm wrong,

1191
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:50,740
I'm sorry. But what I'm not sorry about is it sounds like you pay $40 to get this game.

1192
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:54,100
Yes, there's a free version, but the free version has barely anything in it.

1193
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:59,860
You pay $40 to get this game. And then there's a whole gotcha mechanic on top of that with unlocks

1194
01:58:59,860 --> 01:59:04,580
and stuff. Oh, but you can do the pay currency. If you want to get things faster. It's it's, uh,

1195
01:59:04,580 --> 01:59:09,300
Bobby was calling it Genshin impact on his show, except you're paying $40 to get into it.

1196
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:13,860
And that's something about that really bugs me with as much as I was looking forward to chocobo

1197
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:19,460
GP. Now grant, I haven't played it myself yet. I probably will. I might even drop the 40 bucks,

1198
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:25,620
but I'm a little nervous to now. I'm like, I feel like this game any day now is going to drop to 20.

1199
01:59:27,540 --> 01:59:31,460
But then of course, there's the whole, well, if you buy it now,

1200
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:37,300
you get the store unlocked for free. That that it, by the way, that is literally a thing. You get

1201
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:43,940
the store for free. I have to pay for the store. How do I pay for a store if there's no store to

1202
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:53,780
sell me the store with in game currency? So just just marinate on that for a bit. So like, I don't

1203
01:59:53,780 --> 02:00:00,820
know. I was gonna say I don't know who told Square Enix this was a good idea. I do know who money

1204
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:06,180
hold them. It was a good idea. The same people who said the same people who convinced, you know,

1205
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:09,940
the head of Square Enix, the NFTs were a good idea. These are the people that are saying it's

1206
02:00:09,940 --> 02:00:16,340
a good idea. It is not a good idea. Just charge 60 from the game for the game if you feel the

1207
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:20,420
need to and just put everything in it. For the love of God, just put everything in it.

1208
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:25,700
So anyway, sorry, just wait for the special edition to come out later on with everything

1209
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:29,620
in it. Sorry, I wanted to get to the UK dates. But like that, that was bugging me. And that's

1210
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:36,260
why I'm nervous to take the risk on I mean, a Square Enix game, let alone almost any game at

1211
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:43,220
this point. Sure, I'll pay 60 bucks for Strangers of Paradise, then what? Anyway, Dark Soccer,

1212
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:48,580
what's coming out in the UK? Um, well, the place I normally get my stuff from is down.

1213
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:53,220
But at any rate, there's only one game and that's core keeper for PC on the eighth of March.

1214
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:57,940
Wait, it's already passed. Nevermind. It's out.

1215
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:05,620
Nice. I think Strangers Paradise also in your I'm pretty sure it's a worldwide release.

1216
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:09,540
Yes, it is. If you're saying like I said, none of them are working.

1217
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:19,460
So all right. Well, it happens. So let's move on. Or gaming companies getting involved in

1218
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:25,620
world issues. But this is one that people need to bring more awareness to. So Loki, what do you

1219
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:32,580
Yeah, so EA and gearbox have signed an open letter opposing the anti trans bill in Texas,

1220
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:38,180
because that's a horrible thing that's going on right now, on top of everything else. So they

1221
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:43,780
have this, this thing that ran in the Dallas morning news, basically saying discrimination

1222
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:51,220
is bad for business and calling for the governor to abandon the anti LGBTQ plus efforts that they're

1223
02:01:51,220 --> 02:02:00,420
doing, which they won't, but you know, it was signed by EA, Microsoft gearbox. And I think

1224
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:06,660
those are the only companies that they mentioned right now. So thank you to the companies for

1225
02:02:06,660 --> 02:02:11,220
doing it. It would be more meaningful if you would move your businesses to other states.

1226
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:16,660
But I understand that is something that's easy for me to say, that would impact a lot of lives

1227
02:02:16,660 --> 02:02:21,700
that is not easy to do. And I'm very careful to choose my words, because I have a lot of friends

1228
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:27,460
that live in Texas, that what nothing to do with this bill. And I ever bear to tell somebody,

1229
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:32,420
you should just move because your state sucks. I don't want to run away from problems. I want

1230
02:02:32,420 --> 02:02:40,260
to fix them. So I just hope my friends that are in Texas use their voices against this

1231
02:02:41,380 --> 02:02:48,340
fuckery that's going on. Other companies that were signed on with that as well. Apple, we have

1232
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:57,300
a meta PayPal, Pinterest, right twice a day in medicine. Yeah. Patreon,

1233
02:02:58,980 --> 02:03:05,220
Ikea, Ben and Jerry's, lots of companies, lots of companies. But the governor, the governor will

1234
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:10,660
not do shit until the money starts talking. And that's what you see happening in Florida.

1235
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:15,700
With can we sanction them like we're saying she's in Russia? Or but again, do we do that?

1236
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:20,500
It's caught. It's complicated. Loki. Here's the thing with Florida and that whole thing,

1237
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:26,660
which they are two very different things. But they are both attacks on the LGBTQ plus community.

1238
02:03:29,780 --> 02:03:34,100
Is that your notice? Can we trade Florida for you? Shut up and let me make my point.

1239
02:03:35,780 --> 02:03:42,580
Is that you see Disney. You know, they had their first response. And it was really the employees

1240
02:03:42,580 --> 02:03:51,620
of Disney, who rose up and said, Hey, CEO, you represent us. And your answer wasn't good enough.

1241
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:59,540
And they weren't afraid even though to go to your CEO and say, Hey, do better,

1242
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:05,380
is not an easy thing to do. They did it. And you know what that CEO did? And I will I will,

1243
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:09,620
you know, I know a lot of times we want to say it's not enough to do. You know what,

1244
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:14,900
if we want opinions are not going to change overnight. I will appreciate that the CEO of

1245
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:21,380
Disney at least acknowledged, said maybe I didn't do enough. And I'm sorry, and I'm listening to my

1246
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:28,740
employees. To me, that's a step in the right direction. We just need a lot more steps from

1247
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:37,460
many people to get us to where we need to be. Because clearly there is still anti LGBTQ plus

1248
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:43,780
people in this country that keep trying to push these ridiculous things. And again,

1249
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:48,900
I'm going to explain to you why the Florida bill is bad. Because every everybody that supports it

1250
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:54,500
is like, where in the bill does it say don't say gay, you're missing the fucking point.

1251
02:04:57,700 --> 02:05:02,900
Where in the where in the bill does it say, say, heterosexual?

1252
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:09,220
Because that is the context of the bill. If you think about it, it doesn't it doesn't say it

1253
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:12,260
doesn't say you're not allowed to talk about heterosexual stories and all that sort of thing.

1254
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:18,660
And you know, the whole thing. So I so you know, again, do you do you believe that the relationship

1255
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:24,900
between Alan and I and our cat Mr. Smoosh? You believe that a kindergartener shouldn't hear

1256
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:29,140
shouldn't hear about that? Is there something bad about that?

1257
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:35,700
Anyone who thinks that there's something bad about that has something wrong with them.

1258
02:05:36,980 --> 02:05:41,380
And it's just that that's where it just kind of personally hurts, you know, a little bit. And I

1259
02:05:41,380 --> 02:05:45,700
know none of my friends feel this way. And I know the vast majority of people who listen to this

1260
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:52,980
show. But I also know, there's a couple of you, who you that put up with our political tirades

1261
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:56,260
for the gaming news. And you know what I appreciate I do appreciate that you hang in

1262
02:05:56,260 --> 02:06:00,580
there and listen to people that think differently than you. I do appreciate that. But I just want

1263
02:06:00,580 --> 02:06:06,980
to tell you why it hurts. And why it's much more than this whole argument of where in the bill

1264
02:06:06,980 --> 02:06:14,820
does it say you can't say gay. You all know damn well what it means. You all know damn well what

1265
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:21,700
it means. Don't fucking try to mind game someone who's personally affected by it. It won't work.

1266
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:27,540
Because they've been playing mind games with me from the very first day. And you know what I mean

1267
02:06:27,540 --> 02:06:34,900
by that? I'm gonna say something that a lot of people are not going to like. But I'm saying it

1268
02:06:34,900 --> 02:06:42,260
anyway. Because I know from experience, is this bill going to get seven year olds to stop calling

1269
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:50,420
each other a faggot on the playground? Because I guarantee you it won't. Because it happened to me

1270
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:56,260
a lot. And I bet it happened to many of you a lot. And you know where they learn that word?

1271
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:03,300
They didn't learn. That means some of them learned it at school. They don't learn it in a classroom.

1272
02:07:05,940 --> 02:07:07,860
So I just want you to think about that for a minute.

1273
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:16,580
So I don't understand why. Anyway, sorry, I'm getting too preachy. But yeah, thank you,

1274
02:07:16,580 --> 02:07:21,460
Mike Depps. I just want you to understand how I personally feel affected by that. Now,

1275
02:07:22,180 --> 02:07:28,420
for my trans brothers and sisters, now we have this whole thing in Texas that's going on. And

1276
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:40,900
it's I don't even have words. Where does the state think they can get between a doctor and a patient

1277
02:07:40,900 --> 02:07:51,620
and a family? Who the fuck do they think they are? I just it's infuriating. Period.

1278
02:07:55,540 --> 02:08:00,500
Going to chat. SSU and Hunter Matt says my girlfriend is a school teacher who teaches

1279
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:05,700
ELA English and language arts. She has a classroom library that includes books and graphic novels

1280
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:10,100
that include positive and appropriate LGBT plus stories that her kids are welcome to read on their

1281
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:15,140
own. By this law, she would be fired or sued for this. Over the years, she has had kids come out

1282
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:21,140
to her, asked her to refer to them as a different pronoun, or asked her for more info about LGBTQ

1283
02:08:21,140 --> 02:08:27,620
plus. Kids should have a safe space. Indeed. I can't tell you how meaningful

1284
02:08:29,780 --> 02:08:36,420
drag queen story time would have been to me at that age. But instead,

1285
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:42,580
I participated in it just to see the look on people's faces is amazing. I did it as a sister.

1286
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:48,580
But instead, you know what I got? I got invited to play smear the queer.

1287
02:08:51,780 --> 02:08:56,660
And again, I'm sorry. I know I'm sure Bobby's wincing because I'm using language that's against

1288
02:08:57,620 --> 02:09:02,740
Twitch's terms of service. But I am allowed to say those words and I'm saying them to make a fucking

1289
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:10,180
point. And if you don't like those words, maybe we should stop saying them. Because I heard them

1290
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:18,100
a lot when I was a kid. Yeah. Anyhow. All right. Thanks, Bobby. Thank you for your support. I know

1291
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:23,460
you support me at the end of the day, Bobby. But I'm sure I'm sure there's a little piece of you

1292
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:31,460
that's like. All right. Anyhow, but thank you. All right. Moving on. Please, please a happy place.

1293
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:37,140
Tell me about a very good game. Somebody, Dark Sakura. Isn't me? Yeah, I think so.

1294
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:44,020
So they did an update for Chrono Trigger on PC that now supports ultra wide monitors.

1295
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:51,460
Squinix updated the steam version is the first update in four years and it adds the 21 to nine

1296
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:57,620
resolution, improved D pad controls and user interface improvements for quality of life.

1297
02:09:58,340 --> 02:10:05,780
And on top of that, like the ultra wide support is kind of a rarity because not even Elden Ring

1298
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:14,660
supports it natively. So pretty cool. Yeah, I mean, I'm still playing this next one. But,

1299
02:10:14,660 --> 02:10:19,700
you know, I like when they tweak retro titles like this, though, especially,

1300
02:10:19,700 --> 02:10:24,180
this is just a random update so far after the fact, but it does make you wonder what are they

1301
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:28,340
plotting over there? But I think this is great, you know, and.

1302
02:10:30,820 --> 02:10:35,140
You know, yeah, I don't have an ultra wide monitor myself, but I think it'd be a trip to see.

1303
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:40,820
I'd like I'm tempted if it's going to be compatible on my Mac, I'm tempted to try it out.

1304
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:46,900
Once you beat what you're working on, then say, OK, let's play it again. But on the ultra wide

1305
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:53,780
monitor. So, yeah. And you know what? The chat room is already starting shit on this whole super

1306
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:57,460
Metroid versus Chrono Trigger thing, which is a years old joke. And I was sort of I want to

1307
02:10:57,460 --> 02:11:02,660
make sure we are absolutely clear on this. I have never said I hate Chrono Trigger. In fact, I like

1308
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:09,460
Chrono Trigger a lot. A lot. It's just you know what, when they give the Oscars away.

1309
02:11:10,980 --> 02:11:15,780
I would nominate Chrono Trigger for an Oscar. I just gave the statue to Super Metroid.

1310
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:20,740
It doesn't make Chrono Trigger bad. Get over it. And you know what many of you feel differently

1311
02:11:20,740 --> 02:11:24,020
and we give the statue somewhere else. That is fine. Opinions. We have them.

1312
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:28,420
But I love that a retro game is getting updated like this and all these new.

1313
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:35,540
All this good stuff. Of course, of course. Since you all brought it up in chat.

1314
02:11:37,540 --> 02:11:41,860
How much more would I love it if Nintendo would do some of this stuff on the PC?

1315
02:11:41,860 --> 02:11:47,300
I know I know Nintendo's whole mo is they've got to be played on Nintendo. But give me a break.

1316
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:54,020
How fucking rad would that be? If something like Super Metroid were playable on PC officially

1317
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:55,860
on an ultra wide monitor and all this stuff?

1318
02:11:57,060 --> 02:11:57,860
That'd be cool.

1319
02:11:57,860 --> 02:12:01,220
I would love that. I think a lot a lot of people would. I know.

1320
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:05,700
And I'm sure in 10 years when they finally catch up to modern day,

1321
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:08,660
maybe they will experience that.

1322
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:14,900
Well, and plus, then when they when they put things on PCs, people can mod them. Right, Loki?

1323
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:25,380
Yes, they can. And so one example of that is this new leather jacket for cloud that was made for

1324
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:32,980
Final Fantasy seven remake integrate. And there was some I love it. There was some criticisms

1325
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:40,820
of the mod on the Nexus mods basically saying that, hey, there's too much of his abs showing.

1326
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:45,780
He make a version with the midget without the midriff and you got deal salesman.

1327
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:48,740
Can you make a version that doesn't expose the belly?

1328
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:57,060
Any way to get a version without the belly exposed? So the the mod creators like done,

1329
02:12:57,060 --> 02:13:00,740
his stomach is now covered. And they put tramp stamp on him instead.

1330
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:01,300
I love it.

1331
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:07,060
This is one of my favorite trolls that has ever occurred in gaming is I just want to say whoever

1332
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:08,980
this moderate what's the who's the moderate again?

1333
02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:14,500
The moderate is a joy and joy job. I don't know how to pronounce that.

1334
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:15,140
Okay, names.

1335
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:16,420
Jay Jay.

1336
02:13:16,420 --> 02:13:23,860
You know who you are? I love what you've done here. Keep doing it. Make people mad.

1337
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:26,340
Love to see it.

1338
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:27,140
Love to see it.

1339
02:13:29,380 --> 02:13:36,660
And here's the thing. If this mods not for you, then this mods not for you.

1340
02:13:38,020 --> 02:13:44,660
There are thousands of other mods available. We'll find one that's for you.

1341
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:57,380
If they're that insecure in their masculinity or their sexuality.

1342
02:13:58,980 --> 02:14:02,980
Ain't a problem with ain't a problem with the mod y'all. It's a problem with you.

1343
02:14:03,940 --> 02:14:05,620
If you don't like it, don't use it.

1344
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:10,100
I love dark Tetsuya is saying here stupid sexy cloud bod.

1345
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:13,620
That is the right comment.

1346
02:14:15,940 --> 02:14:23,060
You're allowed to be a little turned on by some some, you know, imaginary fictional dude abs

1347
02:14:23,060 --> 02:14:26,820
with a tramp stamp. I mean, you're allowed to have you rock that.

1348
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:33,540
Have you ever looked at a bodybuilding magazine? Have you ever in your life seen a body? I mean,

1349
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:37,380
I know they don't really sell magazines anymore. But maybe you can think back to a time

1350
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:43,620
when you would see bodybuilding magazines. I mean, have you? Okay, I got a better one for you.

1351
02:14:45,540 --> 02:14:48,820
And I'm gonna hit some of you right in the jugular. So get ready. You ready?

1352
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:52,260
Have you ever watched pro wrestling?

1353
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:55,460
Have you ever read a comic book?

1354
02:14:55,460 --> 02:15:06,260
All right, but with dudes like that, that it's all it's all man fantasy. Just saying,

1355
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:10,820
I do like the the Mega Man Buster arm that they have for Barrett, though. That's a pretty awesome

1356
02:15:10,820 --> 02:15:15,300
looking mod. See, there's lots of awesome stuff out there. I it almost makes me want to get the

1357
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:19,780
game on PC just to fuck around with the mods. But I'll wait for Alan to inevitably buy it and

1358
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:26,020
stream it because he'll he'll mod it away. Because Alan is the one that got the Resident Evil to

1359
02:15:26,020 --> 02:15:30,660
remake mod that had Leon or whoever's the star in that game. I remember was Leon or the other guy,

1360
02:15:30,660 --> 02:15:37,860
Chris. Chris is the one Okay, eventually, Chris is just running around the entire game in his panties

1361
02:15:37,860 --> 02:15:43,860
that and that's the mind that Alan and Alan played. I don't know. I don't think it was a

1362
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:48,260
jockstrap. I think it did cover the cheeks because he did have to walk a fine line with the Twitch

1363
02:15:48,260 --> 02:15:55,380
terms of service. But it covered just enough it was it was the bare minimum of what needs to be

1364
02:15:55,380 --> 02:16:04,260
there. But you know what, if it had been a female character, the one would matter. So anyway,

1365
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:16,020
just put her in a hot tub. It's fine. Humans moving on. I thought maybe for a final note tonight,

1366
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:21,700
we could go back and talk about Mortal Kombat because get ready everyone. Mortal Kombat is

1367
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:31,700
turning 30. Oh my god, how old are you? Mortal Kombat is 30. So Ed Boon posted some tweets and

1368
02:16:31,700 --> 02:16:38,500
you can see his Twitter account at noob de. If you want to see his get N O O B D and over at

1369
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:43,220
Ed Boon's Twitter account. He talks about some behind the scenes moment actually shows a video

1370
02:16:43,220 --> 02:16:49,060
where you can see where Scorpion and Sub Zero's fight stances came from. And I did check out the

1371
02:16:49,060 --> 02:16:53,940
video, which was funny, because in the video he talks about, well, you know, the ice dude is going

1372
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:58,420
to do that like Sub Zero didn't have a name yet. So they were just saying the ice dude or the ice

1373
02:16:58,420 --> 02:17:03,620
ninja or whatever is like they didn't really have names yet. And he's actually explaining the whole

1374
02:17:03,620 --> 02:17:07,940
like, well, what we're going to do is we're just going to palette swap, you know, and change. And

1375
02:17:07,940 --> 02:17:11,940
you know, that was obviously a huge thing in the industry to make new characters out of palette

1376
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:16,500
swaps. And obviously Mortal Kombat became hugely known for that, especially with those two

1377
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:25,700
characters, because what we had Sub Zero, Scorpion, Ermac, Rain, well, reptile, reptile, there was

1378
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:31,700
just like, and then honestly, Cyrax and the sector and all that was kind of smoke was all that too.

1379
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:37,620
And then Molina, Katana, Jade was a palette swap thing, you know, Mortal Kombat lived and breathes

1380
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:44,020
palette swaps. So it was neat to see the kind of really early images of that. I mean, we've seen

1381
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:48,900
these behind the videos things from Mortal Kombat before. But I don't think we've seen these

1382
02:17:48,900 --> 02:17:53,540
particular, you know, elements and in this particular context, which I thought was really

1383
02:17:53,540 --> 02:17:58,660
good. And you actually kind of hear the whole, both characters would feel different. And all it

1384
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:04,900
takes is seven frames for the characters to not just have a palette swap, but to have stance

1385
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:10,180
changes. So that Scorpion and Sub Zero really looked different when they stood there,

1386
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:14,500
even if all their kicks were the same, even if the uppercuts were the same, etc, etc.

1387
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:18,980
It really just took those stance changes to really make them feel like separate characters.

1388
02:18:18,980 --> 02:18:25,380
And I thought that was kind of a neat thing to get into talking about and kind of see that there. So

1389
02:18:25,380 --> 02:18:29,460
that was, that's pretty cool. So if you haven't seen that video, check that out on Twitter.

1390
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:36,420

1393
02:18:46,340 --> 02:18:51,540
you'd like us to. I don't think I saw an email but let me check in with the officiator of the email.

1394
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:56,900
Okay, well, there you go. So please send us emails participate at orangelandtrader.com.

1395
02:18:57,780 --> 02:19:02,100
Um, historically on the show, when there have been no emails, we'll talk about Drag Race.

1396
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:07,140
But I haven't watched all I hear about the new season is that it's not going anywhere. Like they

1397
02:19:07,140 --> 02:19:13,940
never eliminate girls. Like it's the season. I haven't watched in a while. So I just I'm out

1398
02:19:13,940 --> 02:19:19,300
of the loop. I guess it jumped the shark. I don't know. I still support the art of drag and local

1399
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:24,900
queens and even even the ones on TV love them. But I just I think the formula of that show is just

1400
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:27,140
Yeah, it kind of worth it.

1401
02:19:28,660 --> 02:19:34,100
Roo Roo is also kind of antiquated. Now I'm gonna say it. I'm just gonna say it.

1402
02:19:35,460 --> 02:19:39,220
There's a lot of versions of the show that don't have Roo's involvement, but

1403
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:42,340
they they're still derivative of this show. I feel like I'm just kind of

1404
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:46,020
seen it a million times literally a million times of this. No.

1405
02:19:46,980 --> 02:19:52,980
Well, I like that when they bring out somebody who is different, like I really enjoyed Evie Oddly,

1406
02:19:53,540 --> 02:19:59,060
for example. I enjoyed meeting Evie Oddly. What a fascinating person.

1407
02:20:00,420 --> 02:20:04,820
What I have heard about this season is that there's like five trans queens and like four

1408
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:09,140
of them came out. I shouldn't say because of this process, but during this process,

1409
02:20:09,140 --> 02:20:13,940
whether it be on the show after the show, or whatever it is. So and I'm sorry if I'm getting

1410
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:17,860
the numbers wrong. I haven't been following that closely. But I know it's a significant amount of

1411
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:24,740
the contestants. Oh, yeah. I'm dark to see you with a topic for us and chat says I know y'all

1412
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:31,700
are probably not fans of GameStop. But they have the at game legends gamer mini for 50 bucks.

1413
02:20:31,700 --> 02:20:37,700
I got me one super fun to play around with. It's the at games legend gamer mini. I think

1414
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:43,060
this is like one of those full arcade machines. But it's like very small. I'm trying to look.

1415
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:53,700
Okay, it's a controller. And you hook it up to a TV. Oh, that's pretty clever. So you it's like

1416
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:59,940
a wireless arcade controller. And it has a streaming arcade console that it works with.

1417
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:04,340
And apparently there are 100 to 150 builds. Actually, I'm not looking at the mini though.

1418
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:10,420
Oh, here's the mini. The mini is just smaller. It only has one side of it slots for the optional

1419
02:21:10,420 --> 02:21:16,820
pinball kit. Really? That sounds kind of neat. Yeah, there's some buttons on the side that look

1420
02:21:16,820 --> 02:21:22,740
like flippers. What's in this thing? Hold on now. Hold on now. Oh, jumping out right there. Bad

1421
02:21:22,740 --> 02:21:27,860
Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja right there is playing behind me here. Bubble bobble burger time

1422
02:21:27,860 --> 02:21:31,620
elevator action. What are the pinball games? pinball? Maybe they're not in the mini.

1423
02:21:33,860 --> 02:21:38,580
This is very this is very much a mishmash of all these different games from different eras. Wow.

1424
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:43,140
That's pretty cool. What's in the big I want to see what pinball games are in the big one.

1425
02:21:45,300 --> 02:21:51,620
I know you didn't bring up the big one dark Tetsuya but I did. Oh, I don't I don't see maybe

1426
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:55,060
the the pinball thing must be a separate thing. I should go to the chat. They're probably yelling

1427
02:21:55,060 --> 02:22:01,060
it out. I'm not seeing it. Oh, it is a pinball upgrade. And dark to see it says it is very easy

1428
02:22:01,460 --> 02:22:10,020
to mod apparently sting it. It looks at me for 50 bucks. That seems like a lot.

1429
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:18,020
You have my interest off to check that out. We have a call coming into our discord. And this

1430
02:22:18,020 --> 02:22:25,940
is fun because I have yet to try this. So you'll have to excuse me while I'm rearranging the shot

1431
02:22:25,940 --> 02:22:32,980
live on air. But let's get to it. We have a call. And I'd like to bring this individual on. Hello,

1432
02:22:32,980 --> 02:22:40,340
you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? This is why we are Hi. Hi, why we are How are you?

1433
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:46,260
Not bad. But wait, we've yet to try this. Oh, that's right. This is the first time you're

1434
02:22:46,260 --> 02:22:51,380
taking a call from your new digs, isn't it? Click, click, click, ding. You got it.

1435
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:58,580
Yeah. Nice. Nice. And I even have my camera set up the this time. Congrats, I will get you I will get

1436
02:22:58,580 --> 02:23:02,100
actually it didn't fuck up the shot as much as I thought it would. So I will get you on the

1437
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:06,420
screen shortly. But while I work on that, why don't you tell us what's on your mind tonight?

1438
02:23:07,540 --> 02:23:12,260
Well, I'm actually a couple of things. But first off, I just kind of wanted to

1439
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:20,020
reply to your reply from my email from last week, because I and I think it's an interesting

1440
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:26,580
conversation, honestly. But you know, I started off by saying that I found Metroid fusion to be

1441
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:33,380
disappointing because it switched things up too much for me. Whereas, you know, then you brought

1442
02:23:33,380 --> 02:23:39,940
up dread, and how, you know, it kind of forced you to play a little differently. And that kind

1443
02:23:39,940 --> 02:23:50,260
of threw you off a little bit. And I have to say I actually felt the same. The as as I started to

1444
02:23:51,620 --> 02:23:57,540
deal with the Emmy zones, and how they basically force you because honestly, like that's kind of

1445
02:23:57,540 --> 02:24:04,980
how I played Metroid also, in the past, kind of slowly, deliberately, you know, take my time

1446
02:24:04,980 --> 02:24:12,420
exploring. I, the opposite of a speed run, I didn't find myself charging through any particular

1447
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:20,500
areas or anything like that. You know, I would generally play more slowly. So then now, these

1448
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:28,900
Emmy zones are forcing me to kind of dash through and attack aggressively and, you know, just

1449
02:24:28,900 --> 02:24:36,820
completely, it took me out of my comfort zone. And then I realized maybe that was on purpose.

1450
02:24:36,820 --> 02:24:45,460
And I kind of it kind of made me feel more like, you know, well, I'm the best damn bounty hunter

1451
02:24:45,460 --> 02:24:50,980
in the galaxy, I should be doing this, I should be feeling like I'm, you know, gonna attack

1452
02:24:50,980 --> 02:24:56,660
aggressively and, and burn through these Emmy zones and not be afraid of this thing that is

1453
02:24:56,660 --> 02:25:04,100
charging at me and can one shot me, you know, and I kind of like it, you know, it took me out of my

1454
02:25:04,100 --> 02:25:12,740
comfort zone in a way that I kind of actually did not dislike, and then grew to like eventually.

1455
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:18,980
But that's the wonderful thing about the dialogue we have here at yyr is that everybody is entitled

1456
02:25:18,980 --> 02:25:24,100
to a wrong opinion. Occasionally, it's it's fine. I'm just kidding. Well, that's what Jamie said.

1457
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:25,620
Last week.

1458
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:31,060
Hey, it's a good line. Yeah, it's still true.

1459
02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:37,060
Now, but go ahead, go ahead. And then I have to I have to get to a chat comment about you.

1460
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:46,180
Oh, sure. But yeah, the the difference between, you know, the having to play a different style.

1461
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:52,980
And what I brought up last week is that I liked the change in dread because it added on

1462
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:58,100
to what I enjoyed about Metroid, the exploration and the action.

1463
02:25:58,100 --> 02:26:04,900
Whereas with the changes in fusion, I felt that it took away, specifically the exploration,

1464
02:26:05,540 --> 02:26:14,580
I didn't feel as if I was lost. And, you know, stranded in in a unfamiliar world with no idea

1465
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:19,380
where I was or where to go, you know, that that's kind of what I look for in my Metroid.

1466
02:26:20,260 --> 02:26:24,180
And I, you know, and I'm the first to admit, and I will, you know, especially when it comes to dread,

1467
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:28,100
I think we're just going to disagree on the other. And that's, that's fine. You know,

1468
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:31,780
we don't all like the same games is what it is. That's why every gamer gets a voice.

1469
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:36,340
But as far as dread goes, I will be the first to admit, I need to give the game another shot,

1470
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:39,620
you know, and so and this, this happens all the time. And I think we've all had a game

1471
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:43,940
in the history, or a movie or some piece of art, or like the first time we were like,

1472
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:50,420
eh, and then we go back or revisit it at a certain and just maybe realize maybe it was just the

1473
02:26:50,420 --> 02:26:55,620
certain time in our life. Or now, here we are in this day and age, it's it's patches have changed

1474
02:26:55,620 --> 02:26:58,420
the game and upgraded the guy. I don't think that'll be the case with dread. But still,

1475
02:26:58,420 --> 02:27:02,420
you just re approach the game at a different time. And it's like, you know what this hits different.

1476
02:27:03,460 --> 02:27:09,460
And that's what happened with Mass Effect, or I think both dark soccer and I and I and dark

1477
02:27:09,460 --> 02:27:12,900
soccer. I don't know if I'm speaking out of turn, but I feel like dead by daylight might have been

1478
02:27:12,900 --> 02:27:16,820
a thing like that for you. It's because that game has been out for years. So surely it crossed your

1479
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:22,900
path at some point. It was the Lord that got me. Yeah. So yeah, the Lord nerd. And I had been

1480
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:27,780
vaguely interested in it before. But um, but I was always like, I will only want to play killer and

1481
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:32,820
I will get motion sick. Well, guess what? I only play killer and I get motion sick, but I don't

1482
02:27:32,820 --> 02:27:38,740
care. And you've kind of figured out your methods to you know, that's why you do afk breaks and

1483
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:45,380
playing with this thing. Oh, is that trackball? It is a trackball. I have to play with a trackball.

1484
02:27:45,380 --> 02:27:53,460
I cannot use a regular mouse anymore. My wrist will start hurting in seconds. And so I play dead

1485
02:27:53,460 --> 02:27:59,140
by daylight with a thumb trackball or as our mutual streamer friend bourbon says, I play in

1486
02:27:59,140 --> 02:28:07,620
hard mode because I can't 360. Yeah. So I can watch you I can see how sometimes like I'm like,

1487
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:12,500
oh, that you can see that's the trackball. But it's interesting. And I think we have to remember

1488
02:28:12,500 --> 02:28:18,820
not every game can be accessed the same way. You know, well, you also see what I do instead of

1489
02:28:18,820 --> 02:28:24,260
when they start to 360 I stop, right? It's then that's what it is. It's seeing how people

1490
02:28:25,060 --> 02:28:31,220
adjust to those sorts. Exactly. Wait, why? Oh, so you can't 360 not because of the trackball,

1491
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:36,180
but because you'll get the turnaround fast enough for the trackball. Oh,

1492
02:28:37,140 --> 02:28:47,460
so. Okay. Because I would actually have to swivel it around to do a 360. Okay. But instead,

1493
02:28:47,460 --> 02:28:52,260
and this is actually this actually throws a lot of people off. When I see that they're gonna,

1494
02:28:52,260 --> 02:28:56,180
they're looking behind them, they're gonna do dead hard, which is where they run super far ahead,

1495
02:28:56,180 --> 02:29:00,340
or they're gonna spin back around. I just stop. And they run right back into me.

1496
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:06,660
That's pretty funny. And I laugh my ass off. And they don't know why I did that. I was like,

1497
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:13,620
because I use a thumbtack ball. End of story. Now I said I would bring this up with yyr.

1498
02:29:13,620 --> 02:29:20,660
And it was a comment in the chat that said, Dr. Sia says, love how he just happens to have

1499
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:28,420
the egg rent mini running kicks right behind him there on the screen. Talking about kicks. So how

1500
02:29:28,660 --> 02:29:34,340
intentional? I cannot be. I cannot be outdone, but everyone's got their arcade cabinets running in

1501
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:39,940
the background. This is the best I could do. All right. To be fair, dark soccer, dark soccer's

1502
02:29:39,940 --> 02:29:44,580
pinball machines are on the other side of that door. So we don't get to see them in the living

1503
02:29:44,580 --> 02:29:50,660
room. We moved the couch. Yeah. And of course, I'm running kicks on it because, well, it was

1504
02:29:50,660 --> 02:29:55,940
already brought up earlier in the show. So why not? But you know what? Because I have it on the

1505
02:29:55,940 --> 02:30:02,580
screen. I can show off one of its really awesome features, but since you brought it up, you'll

1506
02:30:02,580 --> 02:30:11,140
notice the monitors oriented vertically, right? You push in and then you can turn the monitor

1507
02:30:11,140 --> 02:30:17,540
just like that. Nice. And even flip the screen like your phone does when you turn it on its

1508
02:30:17,540 --> 02:30:23,140
side. That's good. But this cabinet has in it a lot of games that were meant to run vertically

1509
02:30:23,140 --> 02:30:26,740
and then others that were meant to run horizontally. And you can just flip it at will.

1510
02:30:27,300 --> 02:30:34,420
So it fixes one of the big problems that, you know, arcade diehards had back in the day where,

1511
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:39,860
you know, we had games that the home versions would run in rotated mode, but then you got to

1512
02:30:39,860 --> 02:30:48,420
rotate your damn TV, which is a pain in the butt. Well, what a sham wow moment YYR just gave us

1513
02:30:48,420 --> 02:30:56,180
there showing us how it works. Look, it works. Oh no. And we'll double your order.

1514
02:30:58,180 --> 02:31:02,740
What's what's the kickback those mini makers are giving you YYR. That's what I want to know.

1515
02:31:02,740 --> 02:31:07,700
All right. All right. Nothing at all. Anything else on your mind tonight YYR before we let you

1516
02:31:07,700 --> 02:31:15,460
go? Just one other thing. So I've been working on, I'm finishing up the mini games for the

1517
02:31:15,460 --> 02:31:22,020
expansion for super multitasking. I am still working on it. Hades has done a lot of damage.

1518
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:30,100
I discovered that game recently and it has definitely cut into my development time as has

1519
02:31:31,700 --> 02:31:37,860
Forza Horizon 5. But you know what? It's like I discovered when COVID started that I have to take

1520
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:42,260
care of myself too. I have to take some time out. I have to play some games, not just work on them.

1521
02:31:42,580 --> 02:31:46,340
But I am finally getting around to finishing the mini games. And

1522
02:31:48,100 --> 02:31:54,740
the name of my expansion was always going to be super multitasking versus ultimate versus

1523
02:31:54,740 --> 02:32:02,100
ultimate because it had the versus mode and the ultimate game set. And now all of a sudden I hate

1524
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:10,660
it because I want the final version of the game to appeal to as many people as possible. Already

1525
02:32:10,660 --> 02:32:15,780
I'm going to be adding some accessibility features inspired by some games I've played recently.

1526
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:20,020
For example, when you go into the mission mode, which is what the challenge mode was and what it

1527
02:32:20,020 --> 02:32:26,020
will now be called. Yeah, you'll get the options. Okay, here are all the different courses. You can

1528
02:32:26,020 --> 02:32:33,700
speed run them or not. Difficulty. Would you like to play it at 100% difficulty? No? Okay.

1529
02:32:33,700 --> 02:32:40,100
Then lower it to 90%, 75% or 50%. And there'll be separate leaderboards for that as well.

1530
02:32:40,100 --> 02:32:46,340
So anyone can compete. Anyone can test their skills at the level they want to.

1531
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:54,420
But now if you just look at the name, if you look at something, it's like versus ultimate. That

1532
02:32:54,420 --> 02:33:00,020
doesn't sound accessible. That doesn't sound inviting. That doesn't sound like an invitation.

1533
02:33:00,020 --> 02:33:05,940
It sounds like you're throwing down the gauntlet. I don't want people to think of it that way. So

1534
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:12,900
I think I know what I want to call it, but I wanted to take a straw poll here of chat, perhaps.

1535
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:18,740
And you guys, what do you think sounds better? Super multitasking ultimate or

1536
02:33:19,860 --> 02:33:27,220
super duper multitasking? Super duper. I love super duper. I'm sorry. Like as a sequel,

1537
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:33,620
because the first one's been done before, but for you to come out and call it super duper

1538
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:40,260
multi. That's fucking funny. And I, yeah, that's just, see, for me, I was like, Oh,

1539
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:45,220
maybe you could call it like super multitasking party because like party, it means that like

1540
02:33:45,220 --> 02:33:48,980
everybody gets to come to the party and play at the party. But now that you've said super duper

1541
02:33:48,980 --> 02:33:54,100
multitasking, it's too good. It's too good. And there's also super duper multitasking

1542
02:33:54,100 --> 02:34:00,340
for matching service ex plus alpha. I might not go with that one.

1543
02:34:00,340 --> 02:34:05,620
I know. And then I was saying, I was going to, um, I was going to appeal to your, um,

1544
02:34:05,620 --> 02:34:11,300
Bamani fan senses and say super multitasking final mix. But then when, when you, then when

1545
02:34:11,300 --> 02:34:16,100
you were talking about the whole accessibility, I was like, Oh, that's like party though. I like

1546
02:34:16,100 --> 02:34:21,780
that. But, um, super, super, um, I guess, I guess Bobby is running an official poll at our chat room

1547
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:27,460
right now. So you can have, you can have some statistics behind your decision, but we multitasking

1548
02:34:27,460 --> 02:34:33,780
64 says pod culture. Please know we support you no matter what you do. So even if this poll is

1549
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:38,980
extremely lopsided, you do it's your game at the end of the day, you do what your heart wants to

1550
02:34:38,980 --> 02:34:44,820
do. And if you decide to rename the game dumpster fire, we'll still play it. You know what dumpster

1551
02:34:44,820 --> 02:34:50,900
multitasking dumpster diving multitasking. Absolutely. I'll get my suitcase. We're moving in.

1552
02:34:51,700 --> 02:34:57,780
So I know that now see, see, you're getting all this consulting for free here. Uh, and the poll

1553
02:34:57,780 --> 02:35:01,060
is running for those that are, uh, in our live chat, just, you know, you might have to take a

1554
02:35:01,060 --> 02:35:07,380
look, uh, at the chat, the drop, but you can actually do the poll. Um, fifth dream says,

1555
02:35:07,380 --> 02:35:16,020
put a tiny super and a giant duper in the logo. I could have them scaling in and out.

1556
02:35:16,980 --> 02:35:20,340
That would be funny. Oh my God. If it looks good,

1557
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:28,740
fifth, fifth, just realize that you can't spell dumpster without duper. Oh my God. Mind blown.

1558
02:35:34,980 --> 02:35:39,540
And they said unbelievable. They said you're a wizard. Fifth dream. You are.

1559
02:35:40,500 --> 02:35:43,300
They said word all the way to skill.

1560
02:35:46,980 --> 02:35:50,020
Why we are, I don't need to add more to your plate, but you know,

1561
02:35:50,020 --> 02:35:53,620
now there needs to be a hidden button input that makes the extra letters appear.

1562
02:35:57,140 --> 02:36:02,020
I, I should be able to fit this in the dumpster. I mean, fit it in period on the,

1563
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:09,380
put it on the project plan, by the way, actually add a specific level about a dumpster on fire.

1564
02:36:10,340 --> 02:36:18,820
Um, 89% of the participating dark Sakura's brain super duper multitasking is the better name,

1565
02:36:18,820 --> 02:36:22,340
but you know what? 11% still did like the other names. So again,

1566
02:36:23,300 --> 02:36:27,060
you do what you need to do. You'll have fans. 11% of the people were wrong.

1567
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:34,500
Stop that. All right. Oh, that's, that's pretty wild. Well, thank you. Thank you for the

1568
02:36:34,500 --> 02:36:40,500
feedback, everybody. Uh, I appreciate it. And, uh, yeah, it's, uh, one of several

1569
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:45,060
things I'm working on at the moment. Uh, and hopefully at least one of them will come out

1570
02:36:45,060 --> 02:36:50,820
this year. You got this. I know you do. I believe in you. All right. Why we are,

1571
02:36:50,820 --> 02:36:53,300
I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for the call. It's

1572
02:36:53,300 --> 02:36:58,340
always a delight to talk to you. Always a dumpster. Super duper. It's a dumpster.

1573
02:36:59,140 --> 02:37:05,140
Never a fire. All right. Well, enjoy. Take care of everybody. Take care. Have fun too. Bye.

1574
02:37:06,420 --> 02:37:15,700
Y Y R here on launch radio. I appreciate that. Uh, all right. Um, I've said my mind is still

1575
02:37:15,700 --> 02:37:22,180
blown at that talent to recognize that the word duper is in the word dumpster and it's all in

1576
02:37:22,180 --> 02:37:26,100
order too. It's just some extra letters. You know what? You know what word scapes

1577
02:37:26,100 --> 02:37:30,580
has taught me, Rob? Hmm. You can't spell subtext without butt sex.

1578
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:41,140
I learn things. Well, there's no more subtext here on orange laundry though, because I think

1579
02:37:41,140 --> 02:37:45,860
it's time to go ahead and wrap up for the night, but we can't do that until we go run a gear based

1580
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:49,780
final thoughts, but we can't do that until we get to last minute stories. Cause I forgot them

1581
02:37:49,780 --> 02:37:54,260
last week. So I'm not going to forget them this week. Loki, do you have any last minutes?

1582
02:37:54,260 --> 02:37:58,500
Fortunately, I don't have anything I want to cover. Sure. The night. I remember you don't

1583
02:37:58,500 --> 02:38:04,100
have anything. I, I, I know there was a lot of, um, we had some other stuff like,

1584
02:38:05,700 --> 02:38:12,420
okay, sure. And that's it. That's all right. Uh, thank you as always folks for tuning into orange

1585
02:38:12,420 --> 02:38:16,420
launch radio, whether you were here live with us on Sunday nights over at Twitch, or you're

1586
02:38:16,420 --> 02:38:21,700
listening on our podcast feed, uh, through a client like iTunes, Spotify, Google podcasts,

1587
02:38:21,700 --> 02:38:25,540
whatever it is used to listen to podcasts. Thank you for making orange launch radio,

1588
02:38:25,540 --> 02:38:30,020
a stop along the way. Um, you don't have to give us your money here at orange launch radio.

1589
02:38:30,020 --> 02:38:34,260
Some of you do anyway, and we're really thankful for that. All we ask tell a friend or two about

1590
02:38:34,260 --> 02:38:37,540
the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1591
02:38:37,540 --> 02:38:41,700
And you know what, if more people want to come here and tell me my opinion on Metroid is wrong,

1592
02:38:42,580 --> 02:38:49,860
I will give them a limited amount of time to do so. It's always publicity, right? We will be

1593
02:38:49,860 --> 02:38:54,820
cutting them off at a certain point, but you can have a voice for a minute for a moment. Um,

1594
02:38:54,820 --> 02:38:58,900
in all seriousness, thank you everybody who does participate every week and along with the show

1595
02:38:58,900 --> 02:39:02,980
and all that good stuff. Uh, Hey, you can leave us a comment over at vog network.com. You can

1596
02:39:02,980 --> 02:39:08,100
send us a tweet at OLR pretty much. You could probably send a carrier pigeon to us if you know

1597
02:39:08,100 --> 02:39:12,820
where to send it. Like I'll, I'll look at the feedback wherever you got it. So, um, send it

1598
02:39:12,820 --> 02:39:17,540
our way. Uh, technically we have a Facebook messenger account. I just hardly ever check it,

1599
02:39:17,540 --> 02:39:22,100
but it's there. Uh, you could send a message there, whatever, just let us know you're there

1600
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:27,300
and having fun. I hope you are. Um, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1601
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:32,260
Uh, we'll be back next week. Of course, do this all over again for now. Let's get folks

1602
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:37,700
final thoughts. Dark Sakura. I am assuming you are off to a trackball killer adventures,

1603
02:39:37,700 --> 02:39:41,300
getting some three 60 survivors. Uh, your final thought for us tonight.

1604
02:39:42,100 --> 02:39:48,900
Um, I'm still gonna, I think I'm still gonna work on Billy. Um, I was so close a few times

1605
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:55,380
and I don't know who I want to do after Billy. I think I'm going to do a Cenobite. I might,

1606
02:39:55,380 --> 02:40:00,580
I might do him, but still I've got blight out of the way that makes me ridiculously happy.

1607
02:40:01,140 --> 02:40:04,900
And you can see my attempts in about a five minutes.

1608
02:40:04,900 --> 02:40:07,140
All right. Well, fingers crossed you get another one tonight. Good luck.

1609
02:40:07,780 --> 02:40:09,940
Thank you. All right. We'll see you next time.

1610
02:40:10,500 --> 02:40:15,620
Um, okay. You have final thought for us tonight. Yeah. I forgot to mention it when I was talking

1611
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:19,540
about my gaming week, but I put out a new video, which is star of a new Minecraft series,

1612
02:40:20,340 --> 02:40:26,740
the new hardcore series. So it's an experimental one 19, uh, hardcore series. So it has the new

1613
02:40:26,740 --> 02:40:32,020
warden in it, which is like this like big boss character and the stuff called skulk,

1614
02:40:32,020 --> 02:40:38,180
which is basically, um, it, they have these sensors and Shriekers, which detect vibrations.

1615
02:40:38,180 --> 02:40:42,260
So it makes everything you do in Minecraft very difficult, especially when it's spread

1616
02:40:42,260 --> 02:40:46,820
along the world. So I have a new series called the deep dark world. Uh, you should check it out.

1617
02:40:46,820 --> 02:40:52,980
It's kind of cinematic, I guess. I tried to edit it in a very cinematic way. It has some

1618
02:40:52,980 --> 02:40:58,740
really great music with it and yeah, I'm pretty proud of it. And it's one of the only videos

1619
02:40:58,740 --> 02:41:03,380
actually got picked up by the YouTube algorithms. I saw you talking about that and I found it very

1620
02:41:03,380 --> 02:41:07,700
interesting that I guess your, your SEO or whatever, like more people are finding

1621
02:41:07,700 --> 02:41:12,740
Don't know. Yeah. I don't know if it's that or just because, um, there's not really any one

1622
02:41:12,740 --> 02:41:18,260
night there. Cause they just did a one 19 like Minecraft preview thing that came out with the

1623
02:41:18,260 --> 02:41:25,300
alley and stuff. And so there's some of people probably looking at that, but I don't know. It's,

1624
02:41:25,300 --> 02:41:30,100
it's picked up in search and recommended now. So I don't normally have my videos do that,

1625
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:32,900
which is weird. And I get a lot of comments from people going like, well,

1626
02:41:32,900 --> 02:41:36,340
I was surprised that your channel had such quality videos. I'm like, okay,

1627
02:41:36,900 --> 02:41:42,100
set. No one still subscribes. I have like 20, 20% of the people that watch my videos,

1628
02:41:42,100 --> 02:41:46,820
probably less than that actually subscribe. So at it because you're seeing that it's,

1629
02:41:46,820 --> 02:41:51,540
it's a slow burn, but it's burning and more people are discovering it. So if you get one more

1630
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:57,060
men's driver, it's, it's, but God, the water looks so fucking good on your version. Yeah.

1631
02:41:57,540 --> 02:42:01,700
Those shaders and it's going to even be better now. Now that I can run them like twice the frame

1632
02:42:01,700 --> 02:42:07,060
rate as there was before. So it'll be nice. All right. Excited to see more. So check that out

1633
02:42:07,060 --> 02:42:12,740
over at Loki's YouTube channel over at oops, not that screen. Sorry. I'm going to mess up sometimes

1634
02:42:12,740 --> 02:42:20,500
over at youtube.com slash Loki O L R. Um, I don't really have a great final thought tonight. Um,

1635
02:42:20,500 --> 02:42:24,500
just that I'm very thankful for, um, the opportunities I've been given this year.

1636
02:42:24,500 --> 02:42:29,300
I talked a little bit about that. Like my life hosting stuff, um, has come through in a big way

1637
02:42:29,300 --> 02:42:32,980
and I'm really appreciative about that. Um, I'm appreciative. I get to do dragon con as a guest

1638
02:42:32,980 --> 02:42:39,780
again this year. Um, and I'm appreciative you guys tune in to listen to the show and, uh, participate

1639
02:42:39,780 --> 02:42:45,300
and just be a part of it. It's awesome. Um, I think this week Alan and I will do a co-stream,

1640
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:50,740
so stay tuned for that. We're very excited to do that and either survive together in space or in

1641
02:42:50,740 --> 02:42:55,940
dead by daylight or probably eventually both. So, um, that's it. Thanks again, everybody for

1642
02:42:55,940 --> 02:43:00,260
tuning into orange launch radio. I hope you had a wonderful week and we'll see you again next time.

1643
02:43:00,260 --> 02:43:04,020
I'm glad we got an almost full three hour show again tonight. We've had some short shows lately,

1644
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:07,860
so I'm glad we got a good one, even if there was some difficult news this week. Um, but it was a

1645
02:43:07,860 --> 02:43:11,540
good discussion. Thanks everyone for keeping it civil and being cool. Have a great night,

1646
02:43:11,540 --> 02:43:16,420
everybody. Goodbye. You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
