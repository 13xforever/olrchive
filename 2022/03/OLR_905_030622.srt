1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm going to spoil how tonight's show ends.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,700
Our final thoughts on the outro!

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,760
Just kidding, that too!

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,060
But tonight we're ending the show with happy feels about a streamer finding a literally

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,020
priceless, authentically one-of-a-kind item and NOT holding it for ransom.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,660
A rush of positivity to break the streak of headline topics that shall not be named, whose

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,940
value is 100% artificial and dubious to get there too.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,980
This is a rush of serotonin and fuzzy feelings.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,840
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,480
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show, where every

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,000
gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,100
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,280
where every gamer has a voice.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,520
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 905 of our

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,380
show for tonight, March the 6th of 2022.

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,420
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always is Midna.

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,700
Say hello to Midna, licking and grooming herself back there on the chair.

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,260
On my bathrobe.

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,700
Being supervised by Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,340
Yes, she's doing quite well.

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,740
How are you, Dark Sakura?

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
I'm all right.

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,220
I've had a longer day than I wanted to.

24
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,860
I got a bad haircut on Friday.

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,860
Oh no.

26
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,860
Like really bad.

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,860
Oh no.

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,860
I had to get it fixed.

29
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,860
So hold on.

30
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,920
Oh, but your hair looks great.

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,600
It's a lot shorter than I wanted it.

32
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,280
Oh, it looks great though.

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, thank you.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,880
The back is still a little bit messed up, but she couldn't really do much else for where

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
it was cut.

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,640
So I'm going to get it redone in another couple of months.

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,000
So yeah, I had to wait 50 minutes to get in at Great Clips today.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,040
I knew if I was going in for a blunt cut, they do a great job and they're cheap.

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,380
And I'm sorry to the podcast listeners because they cannot see your hair because it's audio

40
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,820
only when it's podcasts.

41
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,740
But remember we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash vog network at the

42
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,060
voice of geeks network, EOG network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after

43
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,380
the Bobby Black Wolf show.

44
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,500
And you can see things like Dark Sakura's fabulous hair.

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,720
And you know what, even if you're listening on the podcast feed, hopefully we get a clip

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,880
or two tonight.

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,640
Sometimes people clip the shows and you can see it that way.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,680
Or if you want actually expect a Pantene moment for me, if you want the entire video archive,

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,820
you can always drop a subscription for a very, very small amount of money over at twitch.tv

50
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,820
slash vog network.

51
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,880
In fact, if you're a prime Amazon prime person, you get a free sub every month.

52
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,560
So why not spend it at vog network?

53
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,460
Don't let it go to waste.

54
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,720
Someone who I know spends lots of his prime subs at vog network.

55
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,800
Say hello to tech master Loki.

56
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Actually it's not true.

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,360
We don't spend actual subs on our network.

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,280
I don't know where the prime one goes.

59
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,840
I was just at my transition.

60
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,360
There could have been better, but that's all I had.

61
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
What is it?

62
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,220
Is this is that supermarket scream that game that just came out of the supermarket streak.

63
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,220
That's it.

64
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,480
I was like, I played that cause the listeners were saying I should check that out and it's

65
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
cute.

66
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,160
And I like the one you have to yell into a microphone thing.

67
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
I think so.

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Yeah.

69
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
It's a mechanic.

70
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,680
I think it's an optional mechanic though.

71
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
I'm pretty sure.

72
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,080
So, um, and I did, I also, uh, to go back to dark soccer real quick, I wanted to compliment

73
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
your R-type shirt.

74
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
I see you wearing.

75
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Oh yeah.

76
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
I'll stay there.

77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,880
We got a lot of classic gamer paraphernalia.

78
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,520
Oh yeah, I do too.

79
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,760
I just, it's under my shirt, so I have to like, you know, don't take your clothes off

80
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
on air.

81
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,680
That's against TOS, but like, oh, that's an awesome shirt.

82
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Wow.

83
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
And wait here.

84
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Hold on.

85
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Hold on.

86
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,560
Cause hi, by the way, uh, since the last episode I've worked on my sound and I think tonight

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,680
should be a lot better, uh, from the sound perspective.

88
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,880
So yeah, there we go.

89
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,800
Uh, basically a long story short, I was using a setting on gain that worked for my personal

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,080
streaming, but it was really bad for podcasting.

91
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,360
I have now fixed my setup to look a lot like dark soccer and Loki.

92
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,440
And that's actually what I thought of is I was like, you know what?

93
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,920
I bet it's because the gain is just too high.

94
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,240
I need to put it on the lowest setting and have the mic right in front of my face.

95
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,660
And sure enough, that is the, that is the trick.

96
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,900
And then I have a brand new pop filter as well.

97
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,420
So I can say words like popcorn and it won't drive people crazy anyway, but behind this

98
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,420
is my shirt.

99
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,420
I found this one.

100
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,420
I was moving.

101
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,420
You ready?

102
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,420
You ready?

103
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:35,780
Nice lens arcade 1983 is what that shirt says.

104
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,780
Nice.

105
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,380
I don't think I've worn that since 1983.

106
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,380
No, just kidding.

107
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,980
It was a, it was a more recent than that, but it's one of those shirts that got like

108
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,740
at the bottom of the closet, at the end of the shirt pile and just didn't wear it for

109
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
forever.

110
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,900
And then as we were moving, I was like, Oh, this shirt, I need to put this back up on

111
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
top of the pile.

112
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,900
It's nice.

113
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,980
Incentivizes you not to have a shirt pile.

114
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,980
Absolutely not.

115
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,700
We have too many shirts, dark soccer.

116
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
That's a problem.

117
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Too many shirts.

118
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
That's it.

119
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Your house for me present is coat hangers.

120
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
Actually.

121
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,620
Well, we got for t-shirts though.

122
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,620
We have plenty of coat hangers.

123
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,620
I hang up all my t-shirts.

124
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,620
Really?

125
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,620
We don't hang up the t-shirts.

126
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,620
We fold them and put them in drawers.

127
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,060
Well, I mean, I have like my tank tops are all folded up, but most of my t-shirts get

128
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,420
hung up so they don't get like super wrinkled.

129
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:25,780
We used to fold them and put them in a drawer for t-shirts for like work button up shirts,

130
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,220
like, like Loki's outer shirt that I would have on a closet if I own that, but I don't.

131
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,940
Anyway, enough about closet life.

132
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:41,040
Wait until you see the closet at this place though, dark soccer, you're going to be like,

133
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,620
you came out of the closet.

134
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,340
Why do you have such a big closet now?

135
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,120
Is it bigger than my closet?

136
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Yes.

137
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,860
I keep joking with Alan.

138
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,040
It's my drag closet, which I don't.

139
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,360
Cause I have a pretty big walk-in closet.

140
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,840
All right.

141
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,480
I'll show you when you're here.

142
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Anyway.

143
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,000
So that'll be the guest bedroom then, right?

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,760
No, the guest bedroom kind of pairs with, well, actually we have a legit, we have a

145
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,980
legit Harry Potter room under the stairs.

146
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,620
And I keep joking that we're going to put like a love sack in there or something.

147
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,980
And that can be the, I told you I've slept in one of those before, right?

148
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:22,180
That was like episode two of OLR, which you were on a trip.

149
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,520
They had to clean the mattress very well before I was sleeping on it.

150
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,260
So just letting you know, it was the frat house.

151
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,440
We're going to go on and get into gaming news for tonight.

152
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,460
And actually starting with a little bit of a look back because I, this, and this is one

153
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,540
of the things where, you know, when we talk about how old something is in gaming, which

154
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,300
happens a lot during the classic game of the week, we have a moment of, Oh my God, really?

155
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,340
Like, Oh, I feel so old.

156
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,380
I don't know if tonight is one of those, but it's one of those that kind of surprises me

157
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,020
that this has been around this long.

158
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:59,400
And that is the Nintendo switch this week, uh, as of March 3rd, I believe turns five

159
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,520
years old.

160
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,220
The Nintendo switch has been out for five years.

161
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,880
Just me saying that, does that surprise you?

162
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,680
Does it felt like five years?

163
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Loki?

164
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,460
Uh, no, because I don't think I picked it up right when it came out, but I don't really

165
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,980
keep track of time for that system.

166
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,040
I guess I can't really remember when like any of these last few systems came out.

167
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:30,480
I remember like the Xbox three 60 and like that generation of systems, but the last two

168
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,680
generations I'm not really keeping track.

169
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,800
Well, I think also for me, like the pandemic has been a big, like warp on time, you know,

170
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,760
like, um, make a play a pun on Mario and talk about warping.

171
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,720
Like I feel like the pandemic has really warped sense of time.

172
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,900
And although, you know, perhaps one of the biggest highlights of the Nintendo switch

173
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:57,320
has been the fact that it was there for animal crossing, you know, when we all needed it

174
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,800
in March of 2020, um, it's just kind of fascinating to think like, Oh yeah, like the, this, that

175
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,480
system has been around five years.

176
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,640
I don't even really know where the last two years really went.

177
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
I don't know.

178
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
That's how I feel sometimes.

179
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Yeah.

180
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,400
I'm going to chat and looking at some comments there, because again, we do tape live over

181
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,280
twitch.tv slash vog network.

182
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,900
And I like to read comments from chat, including Zen monkey 11, who says the switch feels like

183
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,560
seven years.

184
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
It's annoying.

185
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Um, let's see.

186
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,880
Fifth dream says five years time to obsolete every game and resell them on a 10% upgraded

187
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
switch too.

188
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,560
Well, fifth dream, you know, there's a lot of speculation that a switch pro was supposed

189
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,760
to happen and didn't because of, um, the pandemic basically long story short.

190
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,880
Well, there is, uh, the, I don't know if we have a story on it or whatever.

191
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,200
There's a, a hack that happened with Nvidia or yeah, we talked about it last week.

192
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Um, I think the hack came up last week, but I'm not sure the switch thing came up until

193
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
this week.

194
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Yeah.

195
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,620
The, some of the stuff that was in there was a chip set that was allegedly for them new

196
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,620
switch.

197
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
Yeah.

198
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Fascinating.

199
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,960
Well, I mean, Nintendo working on a new console, of course they are eventually.

200
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
We know that, right?

201
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,240
Just like, Hey, guess what?

202
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,120
Sony's working on a PlayStation six.

203
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Yep.

204
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
They are.

205
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,240
That doesn't mean it's coming out this year or anytime soon, but Sony is working on the

206
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,840
PlayStation six.

207
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Believe it.

208
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,720
Microsoft is working on the Xbox, whatever, whatever they're going to call it.

209
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Absolutely.

210
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,680
So, um, let's see, uh, other comments from chat here, uh, E3VL says, I don't feel like

211
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,860
they'll do a switch to anytime soon.

212
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,280
There's Mario Kart eight deluxe DLC.

213
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,720
That certainly does seem to mean that like Mario Kart nine, but what if Nintendo were

214
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,960
to like, I don't know, actually do backwards compatibility, uh, a little better.

215
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,960
And that even if you bought that Mario Kart eight stuff, it'll work on your next system.

216
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Who knows?

217
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Weird.

218
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,400
Nintendo used to be like the Kings backwards compatibility, which is weird because super

219
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,540
Nintendo and Nintendo weren't exactly backwards compatible, but like we had the game boy player

220
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,160
on the super Nintendo, which kind of opened some things.

221
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,520
It's just so weird.

222
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,800
How things have come full circle in that regard where Nintendo now is like, they're not great

223
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
at it.

224
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,160
You know, we had that whole bit last week about how would the Wii U going away, there's

225
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,280
not really going to be as many games that are archived because of rights issues and

226
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,000
bad about about, um, did you, Rama S says we need a 3d S player for switch.

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Absolutely.

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Absolutely.

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,600
You could flip a switch on its side, meaning like a vertical screen and emulate a 3d S

230
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
easily.

231
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,760
I really wish they would do that.

232
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,360
I really, really wish they would do that.

233
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Um, let's see.

234
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,120
There was one other comment here I wanted to read.

235
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,680
Tiger class says the fact that switch is five years old is a testament to its longevity.

236
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,560
Well, speaking of that, there are some sites that are talking about and having a nice look

237
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,240
back on, or, or yes, look forward to this particular year and how, yeah, the switch

238
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,020
is five years in, but this seems like it's going to be its biggest year yet.

239
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,760
And I'm looking specifically at an article on Engadget, one of those tech websites, um,

240
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,100
that does a lot of, um, you know, uh, blogs and things about what's going on in the tech

241
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
world.

242
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
And they write about gaming as well.

243
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,360
That's where joystick used to be.

244
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,600
Remember, remember joystick years and years ago.

245
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,260
Um, and they're running an article this week that says Nintendo switch is about to hit

246
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,000
its prime.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,720
And it's interesting because they're talking about, okay, so the Nintendo gave us Zelda

248
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,900
breath of the wild.

249
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,280
Technically the Wii U gave us that, but I, I get the point.

250
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Yes.

251
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,440
Uh, things like Xenoblade Chronicles two splatoon two and so forth.

252
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:53,040
And then it talks about this year, Pokemon legends, Arceus, Arceus, Arceus, whatever

253
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,880
that game came out in January.

254
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Right?

255
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
So that's the start of the year.

256
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,280
Then we find out last week, Pokemon, violet, Pokemon, scarlet, late 2022, Kirby in the

257
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,440
forgotten land.

258
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,160
Just got a demo this week that some of you are playing, right?

259
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,040
That's going to be out in March legend of Zelda breath of the wild too.

260
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,480
They're saying it's 2022.

261
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
They're saying that.

262
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, we'll see, but we're, they're saying it splatoon three.

263
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,380
Maybe that's why Pokemon stuff's coming out at the end of the year now.

264
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:28,540
Splatoon three this summer, Mario and rabbits, sparks of hope coming up, Bayonetta three,

265
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,540
it's real.

266
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,440
And it's coming out in 2022 advanced wars, one plus two, no man's sky.

267
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,800
Finally getting ported an oxen free sequel, Xenoblade Chronicles three, Wii sports, but

268
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,080
for the switch switch sports, a new Mario strikers title, you see where I'm going?

269
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:52,600
This year is fucking stacked for the Nintendo switch, especially compared to 2020 and 2021.

270
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,800
I mean, don't get me wrong.

271
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,960
Animal crossing was absolutely bad-ass and huge for 2020, but we know in a lot of ways

272
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:04,680
the pandemic kind of messed with things in a way where I think a lot of games that probably

273
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
would have been out sooner.

274
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,400
I think Arceus really was supposed to be last year.

275
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,720
It really was, but it's been delayed for a variety of reasons and whatever it came out

276
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
this year.

277
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,480
I think there's a lot of things where the pandemic just threw the timetable off animal

278
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,520
crossing DLC.

279
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,400
I think that's part of the reason that took so long as well.

280
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:29,720
So it seems like just now everything is hitting this year, but it is interesting for a system

281
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,480
that we keep saying, Oh, they're going to do a switch to, Oh, there's a switch pro.

282
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,640
Oh, there's all of this coming.

283
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,240
Why this year so fucking stacked for the Nintendo switch.

284
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,680
Let me ask my co-hosts if they have any perspective on this.

285
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,480
Why is 2022 so stacked for the Nintendo switch compared to 2020 and 2021?

286
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,640
This stuff got delayed until this year.

287
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:03,120
How about development, hardware shortages for development?

288
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,680
Like dev kits and things like that.

289
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Yeah.

290
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,360
And part of the problem could be, could be, I mean, some of these are Nintendo's own studios,

291
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
but I get it.

292
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
I get it.

293
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,960
You know, if it's not even just maybe development from the sense of the actual professional

294
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,200
hours, we know that was all disrupted because of the pandemic.

295
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Absolutely.

296
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,640
There's that, um, looking in our chat room, uh, SSU 100, Matt is actually asking a question

297
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,680
of the chat with five years of having the switch has your console been docked or undocked

298
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
most of the time.

299
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,000
I think that's interesting.

300
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,280
We have a few answers here.

301
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,960
Uh, E3 VL says docked, except when I need to take a number two, thank you.

302
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,040
Uh, I'm going to assume taking your S your second switch, we'll just leave it at that.

303
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Um, let's see.

304
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Uh, as Joe and Hunter, Matt says undocked, I only really have it docked when it's smash

305
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,200
or Mario party, uh, for me docked 98% of the time.

306
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,960
And the 2% is when I was traveling pre COVID going to things like, um, dragon con I'll

307
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,160
take my switch to dragon con, but that's otherwise like most of my game, I love to play it on

308
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,000
the plane, but otherwise most of my gaming is a absolutely docked mode.

309
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,440
Uh, Bobby black Wolf says it was docked a hundred percent of the time until P cross

310
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,760
came out.

311
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,180
And now the switch lives next to my bed and you know, what's interesting.

312
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,580
My husband, Alan finally bought a switch for animal crossing, but he bought that switch

313
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,820
light, which can't even be docked.

314
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,660
So for some people, it's not an option.

315
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,580
If you bought a switch light, you don't have a dock.

316
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,940
He can't even put his switch in my dock.

317
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,420
It doesn't work that way.

318
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:47,240
So that sounds like a thing that we don't need to hear about.

319
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,940
All y'all need religion, Jesus, whatever, seek it anyway, I tried that whole Jesus thing.

320
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,940
It didn't work out for me.

321
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:59,620
I said, whatever, whatever is my all encompassing anyway.

322
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,380
Um, yeah.

323
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,220
Orange Wright says 99% of the time it's docked.

324
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,420
Uh, yeah.

325
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,660
So, so it is interesting that this year seems to be such a big year, but I also understand

326
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:17,340
the skepticism that they're saying breath of the wild too, is going to be this year,

327
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:22,420
but I'll believe it when I see it, we still don't even know the official name, but I bet

328
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,420
we will get the name.

329
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:29,940
We will get the name at I'm using quotey fingers E3 intent, which I think should really be

330
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,240
called Nintendo's summer direct at this point.

331
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,520
I don't think there is any really, um, w we'll just wait for the dice to fall and officially

332
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,020
make that a reality, uh, or orange right says summer games Fest.

333
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Sure.

334
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
Okay.

335
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,020
Sure.

336
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,380
If we, if we want to give Jeff's ego that, sure.

337
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,300
Uh, Nintendo summer announcements.

338
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
We'll see.

339
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
All right.

340
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:00,580
Um, I know we talk a lot about video games to escape, um, the realities of the real world,

341
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,140
but, um, there's a lot of big shit going on in the real world.

342
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,420
We talked a little bit about it last week and yes, it affects gaming and yes, gaming

343
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
is involved.

344
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
Dark soccer.

345
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,380
I think you have a piece on the latest with, um, how, uh, Vladimir Putin's war is affecting

346
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,380
the gaming industry.

347
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,380
Right?

348
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,380
Yeah.

349
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,460
Um, basically everyone's like, fuck you, Russia, at least everyone with a conscience

350
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,820
or at least a corporate conscience, I should say, um, and actually, can I quickly say hats

351
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:37,220
off to the thousands of protesters in Russia speaking up against thousands of people were

352
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,940
like detained in Russia today.

353
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,180
So props to the people, um, cause I know there's many, many, many, many within Russia that,

354
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,540
um, don't like it.

355
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,900
Um, and props, props to people for being able to stay informed, even when they're really,

356
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,540
really trying not to let you be anyway.

357
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,540
Sorry.

358
00:17:53,540 --> 00:18:00,020
So basically though, we've had EA, um, pull their product from, uh, Russia.

359
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,620
We've had CD project.

360
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:07,620
It's based in Poland, even the makers of cyberpunk and the Witcher, uh, gaming franchise, uh,

361
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,380
halt all of their sales in Russia and Belarus.

362
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,220
Um, and all the sales through GOG in those countries.

363
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:21,260
Um, also, uh, of course the, the, uh, Ukrainian president has, uh, or prime minister, I should

364
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:30,300
say, has, uh, issued his own statement, um, where he's appealed to, uh, uh, different,

365
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:36,900
uh, I'm going to say just different, uh, facilities in the democratic world.

366
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,220
Um, in fact, one of the quotes on here says, I appeal to temporarily block all Russian

367
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,020
and Belarusian accounts, temporarily stop the participation of Russia and Belarusian

368
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,820
teams and gamers in all international esports events and cancel all international events

369
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,660
holding the territory, uh, uh, I, it's the translation on here is a little funky, uh,

370
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,100
holding in the territory of Russia and Belarus.

371
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,140
We are sure that such actions will motivate the citizens of Russia to proactively stop

372
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,180
the disgraceful, uh, disgraceful military aggression.

373
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,980
Sorry, that's the deputy prime minister.

374
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:20,100
Um, so yeah, um, on top of that too, now, uh, the, the first, uh, bit of information

375
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,260
I found on it, uh, it was a little out of date as of the 6th, um, but various other

376
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:32,500
companies have added their names to the list, uh, Apple has stopped selling, uh, uh, games

377
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,900
on the app store, Apple maps is, uh, disabled for the safety of Ukrainian citizens, uh,

378
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,900
in the Ukraine.

379
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:47,220
Um, also Apple pay is limited in Russia, Microsoft, it has a suspended sales of its products and

380
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,300
services and, uh, pumping up the cybersecurity in Ukraine.

381
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,920
Google says that Russia can still use Google search engines, but they've suspended its

382
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,740
advertising business.

383
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,940
So that's all ad revenue for YouTube searching, other forms of Google sponsored marketing,

384
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,580
um, and Google maps features have been disabled, um, although they are still providing info

385
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,820
on refugee sources for people fleeing the Ukraine, Samsung has also suspended their

386
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:22,160
shipments to Russia as of this past Friday, the 4th, um, TikTok, uh, is suspending live

387
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,560
streaming and new content to Russia.

388
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:31,720
Um, they are doing it because there are some, it's actually based on the fake news law in

389
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,400
Russia saying that they need to make sure that the information that goes out is, is,

390
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,880
isn't spreading misinformation.

391
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,720
Snapchat is also, um, halted all ad sales, although the app will still remain for communication.

392
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Airbnb is offering temporary free housing to a hundred thousand Ukrainian refugees and

393
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,120
waiving hosting guest fees for booking in Ukraine.

394
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:01,360
Um, I've heard people here booking Airbnbs in Ukraine, they never intend to stay at because

395
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,400
they're just trying to give money to people that need it.

396
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,800
I thought that was a fascinating, uh, it's the paying, not staying is what it's called.

397
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Oh, okay.

398
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:16,240
Uh, Disney is also halting all theatrical releases, uh, releases in Russia, including,

399
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,000
uh, the Pixar film turning red.

400
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,400
Sony has stopped, uh, theatrical releases in Russia.

401
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,560
PlayStation 5 though is still on sale, um, and they are under a lot of pressure to stop

402
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,400
sales of their gaming consoles.

403
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,080
Uh, Warner Brothers is not releasing Batman.

404
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:39,960
Uh, Paramount is halting all theatrical releases, including, uh, the Sonic sequel and Lost City.

405
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,760
Universal is doing the same.

406
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,860
Nintendo has placed, uh, its Russian eShop in maintenance mode, meaning it is unavailable

407
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,580
and gamers are locked out of purchasing new games through the service.

408
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,660
Uh, EA, like I said, has stopped selling in Russia and Belarus.

409
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:00,300
Intel has suspended all shipments to customers in Russia, uh, in Belarus, including their

410
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
chips.

411
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,860
Uh, Netflix paused all projects and acquisitions in Russia and refused to run state run channels

412
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,860
and on their service in Russia.

413
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,620
Uh, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda scaled back all their operations as well.

414
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,300
Uh, BMW stopped production in Kaliningrad and halt exports to Russia.

415
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,940
Ford is stopping effective immediately, GM is as well, and Honda has also suspended their

416
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,940
exports.

417
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,420
So that's just the overall, like, list of companies that have come into it, not just

418
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:35,780
our gaming system, gaming services, but we have, you know, and actually the, the good

419
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:44,620
thing about, um, Google, um, you know, basically anything that offers, uh, mobile apps is that,

420
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:50,260
um, that is the majority of the Russian gaming market is mobile apps and steam, uh, which

421
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,540
I haven't seen anything though about valve yet.

422
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,820
Um, as of the fourth, it looks like valve hadn't made a comment.

423
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,340
There could be something since then, but I haven't seen it.

424
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,380
Um, I actually do want to quickly go back to the Nintendo Sony thing because we do,

425
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,340
you know, thanks to this show going worldwide, um, and we have folks that participate with

426
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,340
the show.

427
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,820
Um, if they're not here live, um, potentially in our discord server over at vog network.com

428
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:20,340
slash discord, and we do have a listener who I know is in Russia, uh, who doesn't listen

429
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,820
live probably because of the time zone difference, but listens on the podcast.

430
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,620
And this listener is actually kind of giving us some insight as to what's going on over

431
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,620
there.

432
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm commenting in our channel about the Nintendo eShop eShop in Russia was suspended, including

433
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,880
the ability to patch the games and redownloading already owned content on the Sony thing, though,

434
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,960
the, this was, this was interesting brand Turismo seven launch was canceled.

435
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,640
Even people with pre-orders who were able to play immediately after launch got refunds

436
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,800
and the game was removed from their libraries.

437
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,360
So Sony is doing something, which is interesting.

438
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,440
Um, I, I, and I don't know if I would have heard that outside of, um, somebody over there

439
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,800
actually telling us, um, what's happening.

440
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,880
So, and, uh, I'm, I'm confident this is one of those individuals to which I earlier spoke

441
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,040
is informed exactly on what's going on and is not, you know, so it's, so thank you for

442
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,080
keeping us in the loop of, uh, from your perspective, for sure.

443
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
What's going on.

444
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
Yeah.

445
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Uh, another comment, funnily enough today, all gaming platforms have effectively stopped

446
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,480
all game sales due to payment providers.

447
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
They all share.

448
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,720
That's probably the mastercard visa thing.

449
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Uh, GOG had a workaround as they always supported payments using USD, but they explicitly

450
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,960
disabled all sales.

451
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,520
So, and I I'm assuming a lot of that, like you might be wondering, what are they trying

452
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
to do?

453
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,760
Are they trying to just make things miserable in Russia?

454
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,640
And part of that is, yes, they are.

455
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,620
Um, and it's, it's to try to, you know, because obviously we know there's a lot of disinformation

456
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,040
going on.

457
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,860
Um, which by the way, as an interesting side effect of this, I don't, has anyone else noticed?

458
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,220
And maybe this is, I'm fully willing to admit, maybe this is just confirmation bias and like

459
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,100
when you, when you want to see something, you see it, but it feels like social media

460
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,120
has had a lot less bullshit on it.

461
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,860
Like the last two weeks, I'm not saying it's bullshit free.

462
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,000
There's still lots of bullshit, but I feel like if you look at the replies to like a

463
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,220
post from a politician or a celebrity, you're not seeing the same stuff at the top.

464
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,220
And I think that's very interesting.

465
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,740
Just, just throwing it out there.

466
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,740
Very interesting.

467
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:34,400
Um, so, and again, I have no facts to back that up, just my personal observation, which

468
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,500
doesn't mean shit at the end of the day, but I have a microphone and I said, say things

469
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
into it.

470
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:47,180
Um, but anyway, the disinformation that goes on there, yes, the, the Sony, the, the MasterCard

471
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:52,700
visa sales, stop the, all this stuff is going on to try to basically alert the population.

472
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,500
The rest of the world, essentially, not, not completely, but a good majority of the rest

473
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:07,260
of the world is United and that Vladimir Putin, who is the leader of Russia, is the aggressor

474
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,260
in this circumstance.

475
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,700
And as the person, and as, um, you, you put it a very eloquent way, Jamie last week, and

476
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,620
maybe you took it from somewhere, I don't know, but you said something about like, Ukraine

477
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,900
cannot stop the war.

478
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,300
If Ukraine stops the war, they lose.

479
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,700
Vladimir Putin can stop the war whenever he wants.

480
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,700
Exactly.

481
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,980
If, if basically it, it was from a sign, a protest sign that if Russia stops the, stops

482
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,820
the war, then everything is fine.

483
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:43,420
I mean, if Ukraine stops fighting, there's no more Ukraine.

484
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:49,000
So anyhow, um, our hearts continue to go out to the Ukrainian people and, um, just so,

485
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,280
so many people fleeing the country and, uh, having their lives uprooted and changed.

486
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,280
You know, we talked last week about people, the world is a lot smaller because of podcasts,

487
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,400
because of streaming, because of social media, because of all these technological things

488
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,180
we have now, you know, there was a day and age where I couldn't get text updates from

489
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,620
somebody in Russia about what's going on over there.

490
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,040
That couldn't, you guys are kind of talking about the cold war.

491
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,640
That, that couldn't have happened in the eighties.

492
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,360
We didn't get that.

493
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,000
But now technology makes this world a lot smaller.

494
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Sure does.

495
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah.

496
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Anyway.

497
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yeah.

498
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,720
We didn't have our, you know, we barely had what the BBS is and things like that and,

499
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
you know,

500
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
um,

501
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:44,080
Misha and chat asking a question that is a little off topic, but I think is important

502
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
to address.

503
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,000
I am going to this, this question may be, um, difficult, but please let me get through

504
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
this.

505
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And then I'll, I'll explain.

506
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,100
Uh, Misha says, so I have a legit question and this is nothing against the president

507
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,480
of Russia, but what would happen if you were assassinated?

508
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,200
Is it the same as here or is it totally different?

509
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,960
Again, I'm only asking, cause I don't know, um, that is a difficult question and it's

510
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
one of those.

511
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,800
And I want to stress that is not something I am endorsing or advocate because we had

512
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:20,520
a Senator who put his foot in his mouth as he often does, suggesting this should happen.

513
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,360
And this is only hypotheticals.

514
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Yes.

515
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,040
I want to, I want to stress that, but I think there are a lot of people, I think we can,

516
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,720
who openly wonder and I don't, I don't think there's anything wrong Misha don't apologize.

517
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,840
You're, you're vocalizing what a lot of people are thinking, but no, they can't say the quiet

518
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,680
part out loud.

519
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Nothing wrong with that.

520
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,560
Saying the quiet part out loud and that's fine.

521
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
What happens?

522
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,480
I'm going to admit, I don't know politically if it's like a succession thing, but I would

523
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:56,280
assume he is replaced with somebody who believes the same things he does.

524
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,720
It doesn't just magically turn around, right?

525
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,280
It's going to be somebody who learns from him.

526
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:12,120
There's a historical precedence of it though in, in Russia because it's basically all just

527
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,480
like political popularity contests after Lenin died, Stalin, no one really thought that Stalin

528
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,920
would be the one to take over as far as I recall, yet things in Russia, things were

529
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
okay with Lenin.

530
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,600
I mean, I'm not saying they were great, you know, but in relatively to Stalin, they were,

531
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
they were okay.

532
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,720
When Stalin came in, things really went to shit.

533
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:41,240
So they have a massive history of assassinations, corruption, of letting the people suffer on

534
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,200
the behalf of a chosen few.

535
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,200
It's really just modern.

536
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,520
It's just almost as bad as, as you know, what they thought they were overthrowing with SARS,

537
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,680
you know?

538
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
I think so.

539
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,160
I think the short answer to the question, because I know we want to get back into video

540
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:07,000
games, but the short answer to the question I think is whatever happens in that scenario,

541
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,060
it wouldn't be good.

542
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:14,660
And I think especially the way people imagine it playing out, like, you know, a mystery

543
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:19,760
person within Russia does the deed or something and that, you know what, the situation's not

544
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
going to get better.

545
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,800
In fact, it'll probably get worse because then there'll be a lot of finger pointing

546
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,700
and blaming about what foreign power was behind the whole thing.

547
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,820
And I think things don't get better, things get worse.

548
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,860
So we should actually hope that doesn't happen.

549
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:42,260
And that instead of Vladimir Putin kind of is faced with the reality that he's not going

550
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,740
to get what he wants in this scenario.

551
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:52,580
And in fact, the only way his people are going to get the nice things back is for this to

552
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,580
end.

553
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,500
And again, only Russia can put an end to themselves.

554
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:02,140
I think that Russia runs into a very similar problem that I think that the United States

555
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:10,540
has in the fact that it's a very large area for one government to control.

556
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:19,820
I mean, the bigger it gets, the worse off corruption becomes.

557
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,820
If you look at Iceland, when they had their political revolution, it was pretty easy for

558
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,820
them.

559
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,820
They were a small country.

560
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:31,740
You know, their making decisions for a smaller population was one thing.

561
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,280
And there's people who are talking about like full on revolution in Russia.

562
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,260
But they have the same problem that we would have here is that it's too big, too many people,

563
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,860
too many laws, too many established.

564
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
America was damaged from the conception.

565
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,260
I'm just going to say that right now.

566
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:54,860
Russia has kind of fallen, well, not kind of, has fallen that route for centuries.

567
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,900
So just saying, a little history lesson.

568
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:05,260
All right, let's go, even though the real world is important, I know this also is escapism

569
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,260
for some people.

570
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,040
So let's go back to video games and talk about our gaming week and the types of video games

571
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,820
that we have been playing this week.

572
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,060
So Dark Sakura, we'll go to you.

573
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,620
How was your gaming week?

574
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,080
Kind of busy.

575
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:23,140
So I finished Legend of Zelda Link to the Past, which was awesome.

576
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:29,900
My new retro night is started with Chrono Trigger last night, of which I am still cheating

577
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,020
my way through because I have beaten that game so many freaking times.

578
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,460
I have gotten most of the endings.

579
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,260
I think we have 12 of the 14.

580
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,920
Wait, I have to remember which one were the cartridge ones and which ones were not.

581
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,540
But I've got most, we've done pretty much almost all the cartridge ones between me and

582
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,580
Dan.

583
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,860
So I've been playing, so I started that.

584
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,340
We got to Right Before You Get Robo.

585
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,780
So that's pretty cool.

586
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:02,400
I've also learned that there is a particular cheat that totally makes the game break.

587
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,460
And it's actually kind of hilarious.

588
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,700
So I'm not doing that one anymore.

589
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,300
I love, when I had my Super Nintendo back in the day, well, I mean, I still have one,

590
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:19,820
but back then, what I used to do would be to put in just random codes and see if I could

591
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,840
break my games, and I did some very interesting ones.

592
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,460
It was pretty neat.

593
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,260
So I like to do the same thing now.

594
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,540
At any rate, though, that's the retro gaming side of it.

595
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,980
I didn't play Fantasian this week because I'm in that spot, and I got the same place

596
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:47,900
as a lot of RPGs where I am under-leveled for the boss fights.

597
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,620
And I realized that I will need another five to six levels to be effective at the boss

598
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,620
fights.

599
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,400
This is the complaint I have about Fantasian, and I'm not the only one, is that their

600
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:05,580
boss fights say, well, to do the area, it says you need to be level 43, suggested level

601
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,540
43, something like that.

602
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,680
I go in at 45 and get to the boss.

603
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,480
By the time I get to the boss, I'm 46, and it still hands me my ass.

604
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,800
And then I go look at, oh, for this guide, it's said to be 43, but I did this at level

605
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,680
57, and blah, blah, blah, like, okay, game, sure.

606
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,200
So I'm going to have to do a bunch of grinding, and I hate grinding.

607
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:39,000
I mean, I may as well just have a just chatting stream while I grind, because nothing interesting

608
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
is going to happen.

609
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,240
Still playing Dead by Daylight.

610
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,680
I got another Adept.

611
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,400
I got Pyramid Head.

612
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,720
Thank you.

613
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
You know, it's so funny.

614
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,000
I never played him a lot, and then I said, okay, well, I'm picking someone I have to

615
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,680
Adept and just playing them until I'm done with them.

616
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,240
And by the time I finally get the hang of Pyramid Head, I Adepted him, and I'm like,

617
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
okay, I'm done.

618
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:13,840
So now I'm moving on to Spirit, and it's embarrassing, I won't say any more.

619
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,760
So Spirit is my main killer, probably, more than anyone.

620
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,840
It's the only one I feel like I can do well with is Spirit.

621
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,000
I issue you a challenge then, Rob.

622
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,840
M1 Triss.

623
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Take the Eerie Hatchet.

624
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
Take her two Eries.

625
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Oh, I'm terrible with Huntress.

626
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,320
No, no, no, no.

627
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Listen to me.

628
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,440
Listen to me.

629
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,640
Take the Eerie Hatchet and throw it, and then don't refill your hatchet, so you will get

630
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:49,640
like one and a half additional movement speed, and then just M1 everybody.

631
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
No one will expect it.

632
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
It's hilarious.

633
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:57,280
I saw Nick or one of the killer streamers I watched do a build like that.

634
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,280
It was a build for that actually might have been LC.

635
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,240
I did that.

636
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,640
So I had a challenge.

637
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:18,400
It was on one of the Tome thing where you had to hit people 10 times with just a regular

638
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
attack as Huntress.

639
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,840
It was called like old school or something or original or something like that.

640
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:30,360
So I did it in combination with my Adept attempt, and I got it.

641
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,640
And every time I have played Huntress ever since, it's been M1 Huntress.

642
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,520
It has been hilarious because no one expects it to try some time.

643
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,720
It's pretty fun, but that being said, I also got Pig to P350 finally, and I'm just saving

644
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,160
up all my blood points for Sadako coming out on the 8th, which also means nurse returns

645
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,080
on the 8th, and I'm going to try to learn nurse.

646
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Pray for me.

647
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,040
I'm really excited to play the Ringu content.

648
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,440
I think Sadako is going to be a great killer.

649
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
And she's short, though.

650
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,320
I'll be happy with her because she's short.

651
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,420
My problem with Pyramid Head is he's tall.

652
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,040
Same problem I have with Plague, even though it was a plague forever.

653
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,560
The shorter characters, I have an easier time playing.

654
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,800
It just feels like a more natural line of sight.

655
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,160
Even Freddy is relatively short.

656
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,280
Just a more natural line of sight for me.

657
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Right.

658
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,960
Oh, and Wordscapes, because I always freaking play Wordscapes.

659
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:41,800
Also I started playing through Dracula X Rondo of Blood, and I'm planning on doing my embarrassing

660
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,560
attempt at Radiant Silver Gun just randomly one day this week.

661
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,000
All right.

662
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Sounds fun, Action Pat.

663
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,760
You've been doing a lot more streaming lately.

664
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,960
I think since your work schedule changed, you're streaming five days a week from now.

665
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,680
I see you all the time.

666
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:03,240
I try to do streams when you're not streaming, but there's no time when you're not streaming.

667
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,680
Well, I stream five days a week.

668
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,680
That's great.

669
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,680
That's good.

670
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,680
You just have to keep at it.

671
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
Awesome.

672
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
All right.

673
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,360
Well, that's the thing is that I'm trying to be consistent and trying to do more time.

674
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,760
I have a good time doing it, though.

675
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,400
I'm really feel like...

676
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Good.

677
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,840
I'm finding my voice.

678
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
Good.

679
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
That's good.

680
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
All right.

681
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Let's go over to...

682
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,840
I'll just quickly say, I see Sacred Jade in chat saying my voice audio is a bit quiet.

683
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Sorry about that.

684
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,160
Again, the audio's changed a bit, trying to get used to it.

685
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,280
I may need to adjust my code, may not, because I can't make any further adjustments to get

686
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
me louder.

687
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,560
I may need to make my cohost a little softer, and I'll try that.

688
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,280
So we'll see how that goes.

689
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,880
But let me ask Loki, how was your gaming week?

690
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
It was all Minecraft again.

691
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
I know.

692
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,360
I think there's a problem with that.

693
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
It's a shock.

694
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:04,560
Yeah, I've been going between my new hardcore series, which I've been playing quite a bit

695
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,200
in, but I didn't really live stream too much.

696
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,520
I actually restarted from the last time I live streamed it, because before, when I live

697
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,040
streamed it last, I didn't have all the shaders and everything working well with it.

698
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,840
Plus the seed was kind of boring.

699
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,160
So I started a new seed, and I have all my shaders and everything.

700
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,760
It looks super nice now.

701
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,880
So I've got that going for me.

702
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,420
So I'm actually working on editing that first episode for that.

703
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:37,300
And then I designed a new thing for NerdCraft as well.

704
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:43,720
And so I've been gathering resources for that, which has been kind of grindy.

705
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
Lots of copper.

706
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,760
It takes a long time to get that and oxidize it and all that stuff.

707
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,000
So that's been my week mostly.

708
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,040
And of course, HermitCraft season nine launched today, so I've been watching their content

709
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
and everything for that.

710
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Nice.

711
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,480
But yeah, that's pretty much all I've been doing.

712
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,480
Okay.

713
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Let's see, my gaming week.

714
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,400
A little slower than my usual gaming weeks.

715
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,220
I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, a little killer, a little survivor,

716
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,800
playing that as well.

717
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,080
I started streaming again on my personal channel, twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, cheap plug.

718
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,920
But I started streaming No Man's Sky, because that fifth expedition came out the week that

719
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,240
I was moving and I was like, Ooh, I want to get into that.

720
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,240
I want to play that.

721
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,240
I want to stream that.

722
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,200
So I did start playing that on stream and I got through phase one and I only have like

723
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,600
one more task to do on phase two, two more tasks to do on phase two.

724
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,720
I'm really close to being done with one, but I'm making good progress on the expedition

725
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,440
and I'm enjoying that.

726
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,600
I just need to do some more streams with it.

727
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,160
I haven't played any off stream, so I need to work on that.

728
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,840
So I'll probably do that throughout the week next week.

729
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,200
I'm just not sure what days yet, because I'm, I'm prepping for a performance at the

730
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,940
end of the month here.

731
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,520
Just a local shout out, actually, I should, I should give plugs to two local shows.

732
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,640
So if you're based in the Sacramento area this Saturday, a really cool March 12th, John

733
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:09,080
Waters, the infamous movie director of movies like Hairspray, Serial Mom, Cry Baby, Pink

734
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,080
Flingos.

735
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Cry Baby.

736
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:17,440
I'm also going to be doing a talk called Faults Negative at the Colonial Theater on March

737
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,560
12th, Saturday.

738
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,920
So I, and I am fortunate enough, I'm going to be introducing him and I'm also going to,

739
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,120
so after he's done, we're also having a drag invitational of some drag kings, drag queens,

740
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,740
non-binary royalty.

741
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,640
And I am hosting that as well, which is an honor to do.

742
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,300
So yeah, so that's exciting.

743
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,860
So I have that show to worry about, but then also so shout out if you're in the area, come

744
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,860
on out.

745
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:50,980
But on March 26th, so that's in three weeks, we're doing Clue the movie, but we're doing

746
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,020
it Rocky horror style.

747
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,540
So meaning we are performing the movie as the movie plays.

748
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,980
So we're performing the movie on a stage as a stage plays.

749
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,300
So I am in the cast.

750
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,540
I am playing, my role is a secret.

751
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,140
I am not disclosing the role that I'm playing.

752
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:13,100
So you have to come see it to find out, but it's, it's going to be hilarious.

753
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,560
The show is so good.

754
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,960
Like I died laughing today during rehearsal, I'll tell you who I'm not playing.

755
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,120
I'm not playing the singing telegram girl, but I know who is.

756
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,420
And I saw that whole scene and I died.

757
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,420
It was so good.

758
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,980
So it's, it'll be fun.

759
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:33,820
But the other, the other fun twist about Clue, we actually have Leslie Ann Warren who played

760
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,740
Ms. Scarlet in the movie, a last minute replacement for Carrie Fisher.

761
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,940
Fun fact, Carrie Fisher was supposed to be in Scarlet and dropped out to go to rehab.

762
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,320
And that's where, that's why we got postcards from the edge.

763
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,180
But anyway, Leslie Ann Warren is actually going to be there in person.

764
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,380
So that's really cool.

765
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,380
Yeah.

766
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,380
So.

767
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,380
So you're going to be playing Ms. Scarlet?

768
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:58,600
No, but, but imagine the person who's playing Ms. Scarlet, very lucky to be doing that in

769
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,860
front of Leslie Ann Warren.

770
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:05,500
So also, I was also not me, but I know who's doing it and she's great.

771
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Yeah.

772
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,500
It's going to be great.

773
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
So gracious.

774
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,980
So anyway, I, I cheap plugs for those here locally, but also just like if my gaming weeks

775
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,420
seem a little thin, I'm trying to throw a costume together.

776
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,940
I'm in rehearsals.

777
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:22,820
There's a lot going on for both those shows, but it's nice to have stuff coming back again.

778
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,100
This is a huge year for the, in the shows department.

779
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,420
I just, at the end of April, see Dark Soccer, you went like this.

780
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,620
We're not doing any celebrities or anything super fun, but I'm going to still host it.

781
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:38,700
We're doing a goth night out where we're doing a nineties goth double feature of The Crow

782
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,700
and The Craft.

783
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,700
Double feature.

784
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,660
The Craft wasn't nineties though.

785
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,660
Yeah, it was.

786
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,660
98 to 99.

787
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,540
It was towards the end.

788
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,540
It was?

789
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,540
Yeah, it was.

790
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,540
Oh my God.

791
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,540
I thought it was like early 2000s.

792
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,540
So yeah.

793
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,540
Wow.

794
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,540
It was like my last year of high school.

795
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,540
First year of college.

796
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,540
Yeah.

797
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,540
So.

798
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,540
Well, I was.

799
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,660
That's right.

800
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,660
I saw it.

801
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:05,820
And I saw when I was, no, I saw it out here because I had moved out here by then.

802
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,660
So to be fair, they're only calling it goth night out.

803
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,100
I'm calling it nineties goth night out because with those movies, that's what it feels like.

804
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,980
Mike Deft quick on the Wiki says 96.

805
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,980
So yeah.

806
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,980
Yeah.

807
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,980
Then I wasn't out here then.

808
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,900
I saw it in Alabama.

809
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,060
They just teased on, I don't think I'm doing anything with this show, but because I love

810
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,120
SAC horror, I'll give him a shout out.

811
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,000
They just announced on Ash Wednesday.

812
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,940
They have Bruce Campbell coming in August and that'll be a really, I don't know what

813
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,680
they're doing with him, but he's going to be here in August.

814
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,020
So that's really exciting anyway.

815
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,860
Love horror events.com if you're willing to check that out.

816
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,860
Anyway.

817
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,860
All right.

818
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,860
So back to my gaming week.

819
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:50,780
I've also been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy 14, but I'm going to admit I'm kind

820
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,940
of, I'm kind of out of things to do in 14 right now.

821
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,760
I'm really waiting for that content patch.

822
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,820
I really enjoyed the live letter and a lot of stuff coming soon sounds, but I'm just,

823
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,420
I'm sick of the expert roulette and there's really nothing else for me to do in the game

824
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,420
regularly right now.

825
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,860
So I'm, I'm kind of in a waiting period on that with Final Fantasy 14.

826
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,460
So, and that's, that's honestly, let's see what else I feel like I went back and I played

827
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,380
something else on steam this week.

828
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,060
Oh, well I, Oh, I know what I played.

829
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,760
It wasn't on steam, but because I don't have a bandwidth cap anymore, you all might remember

830
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:32,300
when I switched, uh, locations, I switched internet providers and I have fiber internet

831
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,100
now with no bandwidth cap.

832
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,400
And so somebody said, Oh, rub.

833
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,260
So you can re download Microsoft flight simulator, right?

834
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,180
And I said, God damn it.

835
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,180
You're right.

836
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,460
I can re download Microsoft flight simulator.

837
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:54,940
So I played flight simulator on, on Xbox one this week after downloading 140 gigabytes,

838
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:01,240
140 gigabytes, but I don't care anymore.

839
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,740
So it's great.

840
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,920
And it is on a flight simulator is on Microsoft cloud services.

841
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,240
Now if you want to, you know, if 140 gigs is a lot for you, uh, the cloud might, might

842
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,240
be better.

843
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,300
Uh, tiger class says, how long did it take?

844
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,980
I ran it overnight.

845
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:21,700
So I don't know, because not only was I downloading that, I queued up every single update that

846
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:27,540
was overdue on Xbox series X, which was a lot because I, I, I queued up everything and

847
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,780
I was like, I will run this overnight and tomorrow I'll have everything updated.

848
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:36,200
And sure enough, the next day after work, everything's there ready to go.

849
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,200
And it was, it was lovely.

850
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,940
So, uh, yeah, so I've been playing Microsoft flight simulator.

851
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:48,300
And the, the first thing that I did was I crashed into my new house, except, well, except

852
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,800
cause you know, in flight simulator, you, you have the real world, right?

853
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,580
So I crashed the plane in my new house, except my new house doesn't exist in flight simulator.

854
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,740
It's a, it's still empty land.

855
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:04,940
All right, anyhow, uh, let's move on.

856
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,100
Let's get into some news, uh, that happened throughout the week.

857
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:14,420
Uh, it not a busy news week, but a few headlines here and there we're talking about, uh, Loki,

858
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,420
we'll start with you tonight.

859
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,420
Yeah.

860
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:21,780
So, um, some good news, at least it sounds like that the steam deck, if you want one

861
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,660
of those, and, um, that did recently come out and a lot of people really liking what

862
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,060
they're seeing so far.

863
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:32,300
Um, if you're interested in one and weren't able to get in on those pre-orders right away,

864
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:36,240
well, you'll be happy to know that they're ramping up their production, um, supposedly

865
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:42,720
going to hit a hundred thousands of units per month, starting, uh, with April.

866
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,720
Um, so that's pretty awesome that they'll be able to produce, or I'm sorry, actually

867
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,680
maybe not per month, but they're going to be up to hundreds of thousands of scene decks,

868
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,400
um, that'll been produced by April.

869
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,780
Um, but they're accelerating their production, which is the point in the first place.

870
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,560
And at least now, if you want to order it, you can, but you'll just be, you know, at

871
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:09,920
the back of the line and want the weight for it to come out, but at least it's not

872
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,920
hopeless.

873
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,920
Yeah.

874
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,240
I'm here sooner than other systems that are still not out yet.

875
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,920
I'm hearing mixed, mostly positive on steam deck.

876
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:24,040
I feel like some, some of it sounds like it's a little clunky in parts, but like when it

877
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:28,640
works, it works really well is kind of, I think a lot of it is kind of early, like some

878
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,960
of the software stuff still needs to be kind of updated and everything, but they're working

879
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,040
on dressing that stuff, but hardware wise, I think it's been pretty good.

880
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,040
Yeah.

881
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,440
I, I definitely, I'm curious about it.

882
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,520
I want to see, I want to play a friend's steam deck and I also kind of want to see if maybe

883
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:50,160
they end up doing a steam deck refresh in a year or so that maybe has slightly beefier

884
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,160
hardware.

885
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,280
And that might be something I'd be interested in at that time, sort of like after they get

886
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,000
past like, okay, this thing is a success where like, what were those computers they were

887
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,320
building for a while called those kind of flopped?

888
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:07,400
What were those steam hardware or something like that?

889
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,400
Right.

890
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,880
It was like the steam PC, the thing.

891
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,880
Yeah.

892
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,880
Steam PCs or something.

893
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,880
You remember that?

894
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,880
Yeah.

895
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,880
Steam machines.

896
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,880
That's it.

897
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,880
That's it.

898
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,880
I still have my steam link.

899
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,880
Those kinds.

900
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,880
Yeah.

901
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,880
The steam link was all right.

902
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,480
Like I, I found my steam controller too, while we were moving and I'd thrown it in a box at

903
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,480
some point anyway.

904
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,520
Um, but yeah, I'm, I'd be curious about the steam deck, but because it's, especially if

905
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,560
these things start to take off in a way that the steam machines didn't, then they probably

906
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,960
will refresh them, make better ones and so forth.

907
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,080
A little later on down the line.

908
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:45,160
It's interesting to think those steam machines, as much as I, it sounds like I'm talking shit

909
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,160
about them right now.

910
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,740
I'm not because I sort of think this is the evolution of those is they really took a look

911
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,840
at how do we get hardware that people want?

912
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,400
And I think valve looked at what Nintendo was doing and was like, Oh, we could do that.

913
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,580
The steam machine.

914
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:06,200
So we're more of like, it's just, this is like a PC specification that you're like,

915
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,400
we're going to just basically have anybody can build these.

916
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,000
And then we're going to throw Linux on there.

917
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,240
Whereas this, the steam deck is like, it's a set piece of hardware.

918
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,800
You know what the specs are games either run or they don't run on it.

919
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,880
It's not going to be like, well, it's kind of like the difference between like, you know,

920
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:28,720
games made for iOS and games made for Android, whereas iOS, you have certain phones and devices,

921
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,720
you know, the specs for Android is just like, it's a wild west out there.

922
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,480
Like there's phones all over the place and all sorts of different ranges and resolutions

923
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,480
and whatnot.

924
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,240
And so it's hard to like, be able to say, yeah, this will definitely run.

925
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,480
This will not run, you know, whatnot.

926
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,640
So I think the steam deck is definitely the step in the right direction.

927
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,300
If they want to do like a console version of that.

928
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,720
I'm all down for that as well.

929
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,480
I am, you know, a quick aside on the steam deck.

930
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,920
One thing I am hearing it does very well is emulation.

931
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,260
Certainly the classics you know, and again, I don't advocate piracy, however, especially

932
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:10,200
in Nintendo's case when you know, it's, it's, we know they're not very good at embracing

933
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,200
the old library.

934
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,720
I mean, we have some first party and second party stuff on the Netflix style library,

935
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,240
but there's certainly so many games like the guardian legend, right?

936
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,960
Our holy grail here at OLR, the guardian legend has never seen the light of day on virtual

937
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,920
console or any of that stuff because of rights issues.

938
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,600
So the only way to play it is to emulate it.

939
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,360
So it sounds like the steam deck does those very well, but it also sounds like the steam

940
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,840
deck is emulating like newer hardware pretty well to like, didn't they get a switch emulator

941
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
running on it?

942
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,800
Again, I don't advocate for piracy of stuff, especially not independent developed games

943
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,240
and so forth.

944
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:50,640
I, I think it's, I, I, you know, I, I'm not gonna deny that it exists and I think it's

945
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:57,760
interesting for sure because it sounds like Nintendo was like shutting down YouTube's

946
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,920
that were explaining how to get switch emulators on your steam deck, which I thought was very

947
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,920
interesting.

948
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,040
Um, and you know, I, I understand Nintendo trying to shut down those channels, but we

949
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,040
all know once on the internet, always, always on the internet and if that's why the way

950
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,680
back machine exists, if somebody wants to emulate a switch on the steam deck, they're

951
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,640
going to figure it out.

952
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,640
So, yep.

953
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:28,560
And Mike Deaf says, which I mean, apparently, yes, the PC is, uh, I mean, why not?

954
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,560
Yeah.

955
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,360
And again, I, I don't advocate doing that, but for retro library and game preservations

956
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:39,080
and things that Nintendo refuses to let us buy, uh, I feel a lot differently.

957
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:45,360
Um, let's see, um, interesting Rama, uh, in our chat over at twitch.tv slash log network

958
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,560
says, based on the success of the steam deck, I could see a newer steam machine or even

959
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:57,040
a steam tablet staying, um, that maybe they would revisit the steam machine concept.

960
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,760
I suppose anything's possible.

961
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:05,600
I kind of think this is it now, but who knows, uh, very interesting aha moment from fifth

962
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:10,880
dream who says ESP games can now run natively on switch, LOL.

963
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,800
I mean, Vita, I heard about that, that the Vita emulator now runs on switch.

964
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,240
Uh, I, when I first read that, my brain went to the steam deck running these games, but

965
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,920
isn't that also an interesting way to preserve the libraries, especially when we know Sony

966
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,360
wants nothing more to be than to be rid of the Vita online service.

967
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,120
Did they finally say they were going to shut it down?

968
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,120
I don't even remember.

969
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,840
I feel like they finally are starting to end of life it, but, um, very interesting.

970
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,240
Um, let's see.

971
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,200
There was one other thing I wanted to say, Oh, uh, before we get to the next story, a

972
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:49,640
comment on my internet, Rama said, just because you have gigabit internet, that doesn't mean

973
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,680
you'll always have one gig up and down.

974
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,520
Mine is in the 800 or excuse me, 800 to 95 megabyte at any given time.

975
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,280
So Ms.

976
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,120
Flight Sim would take less than 30 minutes.

977
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,240
So to answer that question, I do have gigabit internet.

978
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,640
Most of the speed tests are pretty reliably giving me between 900 and a thousand.

979
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,120
So knock on wood, it's pretty good.

980
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,600
Here's the fun, here's the fun thing you might not know because it's new development and

981
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,600
you know, we're, you know, we're pretty close to city center and all that.

982
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,880
Um, 2000 and 5,005 gigabit was an option.

983
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,600
Um, but we act, we actually said that might actually be too much.

984
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,800
I w and I was really trying to think, why would we need five gigabit?

985
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,960
And I'm not sure we need it right now.

986
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,200
Like my PC can't even support streaming 4k, just processing it.

987
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,240
I'm not sure I need the bandwidth for that right now.

988
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,840
Maybe in the future, who knows?

989
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,320
But yeah.

990
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:51,160
Uh, so that's what I, I actually do not have the best available internet here because I

991
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,680
said that, that, that might be a bit much, but in 10 years.

992
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,880
That may be what we need.

993
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,440
So, all right.

994
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,360
It's a mixed reaction from chat.

995
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,080
Some people saying why the hell not others saying valid.

996
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:05,840
All right, fair enough.

997
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,640
Um, anyway, we talked a minute ago about the Nintendo switch turning five years old,

998
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,360
and I'm not sure this was intentionally timed for the anniversary, but it is

999
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,240
interesting that, uh, this comes out just in time for that.

1000
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:21,760
And that is that Nintendo switch now has missions and rewards.

1001
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,560
And when I first heard that, I got excited because I thought that meant,

1002
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,840
Ooh, finally achievements.

1003
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:36,680
It's not really that, um, it's like, no, no, it's a little more like Microsoft's

1004
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,840
rewards, which I've talked a little bit about on this show before, but Microsoft's

1005
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,280
rewards is basically you get points when you use game pass, um, when you earn an

1006
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,320
achievement, ironically enough, although that's not here, um, what does the Nintendo

1007
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:50,840
thing do?

1008
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:57,360
You get my Nintendo platinum points, um, by doing certain things within the Nintendo

1009
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:57,840
switch.

1010
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,440
So for example, if you play a game within the Nintendo switch online library, you get

1011
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,440
some platinum points.

1012
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,000
Um, you get, uh, for, for logging into the website and doing other things, you get

1013
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,680
platinum points.

1014
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,680
So you do these things and they've given more rewards for platinum points because it

1015
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,520
felt like for a while there, there wasn't shit you could get with platinum points.

1016
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,400
Um, I remember for a hot minute, there was like a Zelda P cross game you could get on

1017
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,840
3DS and like there were some decent things you could get with platinum points, but it

1018
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,240
hasn't been that way for a while.

1019
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,000
Now you're going to be able to get, um, apparently physical items from the Nintendo

1020
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,160
store, or at least they claim, I imagine you have to be fast to get those, but you can

1021
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:45,560
also get digital perks like wallpapers and icon elements, but also changing your user

1022
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:51,160
icon within the switch with new frames, new characters and new backgrounds.

1023
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,160
So that's something a little bit new.

1024
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,520
And some of you might find that silly, but at the same time, you're not really having

1025
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,440
to do much to get these points either.

1026
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,800
Um, you don't have to do anything like, you don't, you don't really have to spend

1027
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,080
money unless you don't already have Nintendo switch online or something in order to do

1028
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:07,360
that.

1029
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,960
So, um, there are some rewards posted right now.

1030
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,240
There are some various animal crossing characters.

1031
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,600
I don't recognize any of these, but I think they are the same animal crossing characters

1032
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,280
that have March birthdays.

1033
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,480
So that's, that's the tie in.

1034
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,400
And then it looks like some super Mario Odyssey icons.

1035
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,000
Like I see, um, uh, captain toad in there.

1036
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I see some of the various, uh, like, um, the cheap, cheap wearing the Mario hat and

1037
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,600
things like that.

1038
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,400
There's some just unique icons you can get with those, which is all right.

1039
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,600
You, I guess, but probably nothing anyone's going to drop everything and go for, but

1040
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,240
you know, if they get up the quality of some of these rewards, that could be very

1041
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:45,680
interesting.

1042
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:52,240
I think, um, I just, man, I felt like we were getting so close to achievements, which

1043
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:52,760
would be fun.

1044
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,600
I just, and I talked about this on last week's show.

1045
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,360
I hate saying this time blue in the face, but it would just be so cool if we could

1046
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:05,960
have like a digital trophy shelf to really show that I beat kid Icarus without using a

1047
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,440
code.

1048
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,000
That's a bit, that should be, that should be recognized as the big fucking deal that

1049
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,520
it is.

1050
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,960
Yeah, that game ain't easy.

1051
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:14,920
Exactly.

1052
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,280
So I think it'd be nice.

1053
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:22,280
Uh, E3VL says, log in a week, once a week for 30 points, mobile games for platinum

1054
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:22,640
points.

1055
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,880
Oh, I think that was a thing for a hot minute too.

1056
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,160
You could get some rewards and like the animal crossing game and the Mario cart game

1057
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,240
with your platinum points.

1058
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:34,280
So that's, um, that's another thing you can, um, I think, I think is still available.

1059
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,080
So, yeah, I think that's still about, I haven't checked in a while.

1060
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,480
Yeah, I've, it's been a while since I played any of the Nintendo mobile titles.

1061
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:42,760
All right.

1062
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,480
Uh, moving on dark soccer.

1063
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,120
What do you have for us?

1064
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,480
I have a thing.

1065
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:55,040
Well, and as we, uh, teased at the end of Bobby's show, um, uh, Epic games has made an

1066
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,520
acquisition and we know that Epic games is a video game company.

1067
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,840
They've got their store, they did Fortnite.

1068
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:08,960
Um, but they acquired band camp, which when I first saw that, I just went, I burped a

1069
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:09,680
little bit.

1070
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,920
Um, but they announced that they were quote joining Epic games.

1071
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:22,360
So there's nothing about like an actual, how much they paid, what the details are, but

1072
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,000
they say that band camp's going to keep operating the way that it did.

1073
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:33,960
Um, um, but that they turned down previous, uh, corporate attempts, but believe that

1074
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,200
Epic is aligned with their vision and values.

1075
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,840
Um, so it is what it is.

1076
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:49,120
So, um, hopefully it will, it won't affect, you know, band camp continuing with the way

1077
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,520
that they are, but at the same time, I'm a little bit iffy.

1078
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,600
I just, there's things Epic does that just make me unhappy.

1079
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,080
But now the good thing about band camp though, is that like I've been introduced to so many

1080
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:03,640
good artists.

1081
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,560
Like that's how I learned about Mystery Skulls.

1082
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:15,520
Um, and it was actually, I had seen that whole video that was a parody of, uh, Phoenix

1083
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,240
Wright, the, the turntable turnabout.

1084
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:26,400
And that had me looking for that song, which led me to finding, uh, the band camp site,

1085
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,440
uh, their, their album on band camp, which, which I bought.

1086
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,320
Um, I found a lot of good artists that way.

1087
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,440
So, uh, hopefully they'll still continue to be able to give people the exposure, especially

1088
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,400
for people just starting out.

1089
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,640
So, um, I, I don't know, it's, it's weird.

1090
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,160
I understand why indie artists have reservations.

1091
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:46,920
Absolutely.

1092
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,560
And you're right.

1093
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:52,040
Epic does have a strange track record, um, especially, you know, the guy running it writes

1094
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:57,960
a lot of dumb shit on Twitter and, you know, picks fights, uh, try trying to be a, um, a

1095
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,840
martyr when, you know, he has problems in his own backyard.

1096
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,480
But anyway, I digress, but I see why people have problems with it.

1097
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,360
Um, I could see, you know, and a lot of people are thinking, Oh, this is like a Fortnite

1098
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:10,760
thing.

1099
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,680
And, you know, no, they're insisting, like, they're not changing band camp or anything

1100
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:20,680
like that, but it could be interesting, especially, you know, if, if, if Fortnite really is more

1101
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,480
than just a shooter game, which is what the creators of Fortnite wants you to believe.

1102
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:29,800
And if trying to try to show in interesting cases, like we talked many months ago on the

1103
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,560
show about the Ariana Grande concert.

1104
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,000
And that was the first thing that happened in Fortnite in a long time that really made me

1105
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,640
look and go the fuck, but like in a good way, because it was something where it was like,

1106
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,760
okay, Fortnite is being used for something that I don't associate with Fortnite.

1107
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And that was like an interactive music video type of thing.

1108
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,680
So my point is.

1109
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,960
That thing isn't exactly unprecedented.

1110
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:49,560
Yeah.

1111
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:57,560
But if, if Epic is trying to leverage band camp or indie artists exposure to tie together

1112
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:04,280
Fortnite into some type of pop culture universe soundtrack made by indie artists, I could see

1113
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:09,200
that there may be some exciting prospects there, but I also completely understand and respect that

1114
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,920
there are some indie artists that want fucking nothing to do with Fortnite and don't want

1115
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,880
anything to change.

1116
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,480
And I think it's important to keep them happy or guess what?

1117
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,320
They'll just form a new site like band camp.

1118
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,880
It should be just, there should be options for it.

1119
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:27,080
There's nothing stopping the indie artists from leaving at any time and going to a new

1120
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:27,560
place.

1121
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,400
That's the thing.

1122
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,720
Epic didn't buy the music.

1123
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,240
Epic bought band camp.

1124
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,840
Some interesting perspectives in chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network, because we are where

1125
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,160
every gamer has a voice and some voices on this.

1126
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:46,040
Rama says, I did hear that Tencent pushed Epic's hand because Tencent already has investments in

1127
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,320
Spotify and other music services.

1128
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,560
If I recall correctly, it feels like Tencent.

1129
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,040
That actually has been mentioned about it too.

1130
01:02:54,600 --> 01:03:02,400
But I mean, there's also the mention though, that since Epic acquired, uh, harmonics that maybe

1131
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,800
they already had the interest in music.

1132
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:05,960
Uh, S.

1133
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:10,560
Joe and Hunter Matt says, uh, well, a wait and see, but I totally get the indie artist whose

1134
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:15,120
livelihood is tied to this system that is now going to be in bed with Tencent as well.

1135
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:15,440
Yeah.

1136
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,600
I understand the reservations for sure.

1137
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,120
For sure.

1138
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,800
So we'll just have to see what develops and, um, what Epic does with this.

1139
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,040
Moving on Loki.

1140
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:26,600
Yeah.

1141
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,960
So this is pretty cool news.

1142
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:35,560
So we've got John Romero, the co-creator of the doom franchise, and he is releasing a brand new

1143
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,480
level for doom too.

1144
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,960
He's like charging a five year old for it.

1145
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,960
And, um, if you, uh, make that donation, you can get the wonderful level and a hundred percent of the

1146
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:54,320
proceeds go towards, uh, the red cross and UN central emergency response funds.

1147
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:02,200
So for a good cause, and you get to play some new doom, considering that he hasn't made a level for

1148
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,800
doom or at least doom too, since I think the game came out.

1149
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:12,520
I heard some of the personal effects with this are very nice as well, that he actually has like the

1150
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:17,320
community created identification files in there and that he filled them out.

1151
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:22,720
Just like any other like fan content creator would, and that, I guess there's a section that

1152
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,000
refers to what other wads did this creator make?

1153
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,480
Cause, uh, WAD is the type of like doom.

1154
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:28,840
Yeah.

1155
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,360
And he just put doom dot wad, doom two dot wad.

1156
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,760
And I thought that was funny.

1157
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,000
Like it's the little effects like that, that made this cute.

1158
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:44,920
But I also love the fact that, you know, like, This is a really creative way to like raise money for a

1159
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:51,560
cause like this is, this is somebody coming back from, you know, the class, the archives really to get

1160
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,440
back on the horse.

1161
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,560
And, and I don't know if this was new or maybe something that was unfinished before.

1162
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:01,040
Um, but I think this is really cool and definitely, you know, something that, um, is worthy of, of

1163
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,040
tossing some point at.

1164
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,200
So, um, yeah, pretty cool.

1165
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:04,600
Yeah.

1166
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:11,400
I wonder what other classic, uh, game developers, you think we could get David Crane to make a pitfall three.

1167
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:13,440
Who knows?

1168
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:14,480
Who knows?

1169
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,520
Maybe a pinball table.

1170
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:15,680
No.

1171
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:15,880
Okay.

1172
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:24,400
I don't, I don't, I don't want to make light of a, what is a serious fundraising effort, but I just think it's a, it's a really cool, uh, like innovative way to do some fundraising.

1173
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,000
And I hope it's really.

1174
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,400
All right, moving on.

1175
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:43,880
I also hope this is successful because let me tell you, as much as I enjoy Microsoft flight simulator on Xbox series X, it is painfully obvious that it is just a port of a PC game running on the series X up to the point that when you first launched a game,

1176
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:50,360
you see a computer mouse in the upper left-hand corner of the screen that you can't use or touch or do anything with.

1177
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,600
It's kind of humorous to me.

1178
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,200
Um, it's interesting that Legend of Zaku says you need to use a flight stick.

1179
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:56,720
I do.

1180
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,080
I'm not buying a flight stick may well, never say never.

1181
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,480
I'm not interested in one yet, but I will say.

1182
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,680
Flight simulator is like, it's a beautiful game.

1183
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:16,520
It is just, it's a beautiful, chill game, very relaxing, very relaxing to just, you know, chill out and play flight simulator.

1184
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,360
It's great.

1185
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:26,040
So, um, anyway, uh, looking at, uh, the next story, which talks about keyboard and mouse support potentially coming to Xbox cloud gaming.

1186
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:37,920
Um, and actually they're talking about flight simulator in this, uh, report too, is that, uh, you can't use a keyboard and mouse on the Xbox one version.

1187
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:47,520
But according to the, uh, head of the team that made flight simulator, Jorg Newman, uh, there was a Q and a, uh, that was done.

1188
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,280
And, uh, Jorg Newman said Microsoft is working on adding.

1189
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,920
Platform level support for keyboard and mouse.

1190
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,400
And most games on Xbox cloud gaming could include this method.

1191
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,400
The quote is.

1192
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,840
So the platform team is working on this.

1193
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,640
I know I can't give a date because it's the platform team.

1194
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,560
I don't know their dates, but it's coming.

1195
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,920
I'm hoping it will be done by June or so, but I can't ever tell that seems kind of new.

1196
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:23,760
Uh, so the verge, uh, saw this interview and asked Microsoft to make an official comment, which a spokesperson said, quote at launch Microsoft fight simulator.

1197
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:29,320
I say fight simulator, Microsoft flight simulator supports standard controller inputs for cloud gaming.

1198
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:35,400
The team is experimenting with touch gyro and is excited to embrace mouse and keyboard.

1199
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:40,800
Once it's available on the platform, we have no specific announcements or timing to share at this time.

1200
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,960
Um, some other things that could really benefit from mouse and keyboard support.

1201
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:51,200
PC and Mac players could play halo infinite with their keyboard and mouse on the cloud.

1202
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:58,600
Cause even if you're playing halo infinite today on a PC on the cloud, if you're playing it, not on the cloud, you can use the word mouse.

1203
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,840
We've played the cloud version.

1204
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:05,720
You have to use a controller because the cloud is all powered with Xbox series X.

1205
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,160
So that could be very interesting.

1206
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,280
Um, and, uh, yeah, I'm all for it.

1207
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:18,280
I think, uh, there are some games I enjoy with, uh, a controller, but there's a lot I enjoy with keyboard and mouse as well.

1208
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:18,840
Sure.

1209
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:25,200
Doc was trying to win me over in chat saying it's not that expensive for Microsoft flight simulator.

1210
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,160
We'll see.

1211
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:26,600
We'll see.

1212
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,400
We'll see someday.

1213
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,960
Rob, what thrift?

1214
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,200
Oh, maybe I'll keep an eye out for you.

1215
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,720
Maybe that's not a bad idea.

1216
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,200
We'll see.

1217
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,480
I find flight sticks all the time at thrift stores.

1218
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,440
So I'll keep my eyes open.

1219
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,680
All right, moving on.

1220
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,280
We may have one I could lend you.

1221
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:40,760
I don't know.

1222
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,560
What do you have for us?

1223
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:53,160
So there is, it's right now still a bit of a rumor, but, um, Oh my goodness.

1224
01:08:54,080 --> 01:09:00,320
So Star Wars Eclipse, the game that was to be developed by Quantic Dream, uh, may actually be canceled.

1225
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:07,640
Um, they were basically, they put out that, like that really pretty trailer and everyone was excited about it.

1226
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:15,600
But, um, it was supposed to be released in 2024, but they're saying it can be pushed back to 2027 or 2028.

1227
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:22,520
Uh, Quantic Dream, uh, well, first of all, we know that they've had some problems with their toxic work culture.

1228
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:35,440
Um, but they were basically saying that with that trailer, the purpose of it was to, of course, attack, attract a talent to, to help work on the game, but it didn't have the desired effect.

1229
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,000
Uh, no one would step up and work on it.

1230
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,080
Um, the staffing issues are really, really the, the issue.

1231
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:49,920
Um, the, the site actually is quoted as saying, staffing issues are pushing the release of the game far, far away.

1232
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,400
As a result, Star Wars Eclipse is likely to be released around 2027 to 2028.

1233
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:03,800
And on top of that, Quantic Dream has been really pushing to get more job openings, but they're going unfilled.

1234
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:14,400
Um, they have, they update their dates for the same job openings and, uh, and now it's also rumored that they're trying to shop themselves out for acquisition.

1235
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:22,880
So, um, oh, and the other thing too, is that they're saying that there's some problems with the, with the QD game engine, which they would be using for Star Wars Eclipse.

1236
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,640
So any number of reasons.

1237
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,800
So I'll believe it when I see it.

1238
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:38,320
I really, you know, I like the games that they've made, even if I don't enjoy the, you know, what the, excuse me, what the company has done.

1239
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:47,480
I would like to hope that maybe bringing in new talent and new blood, if they could get the people would change their, the culture there.

1240
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,160
But that's, seems like it's going to be a bit of a pipe dream.

1241
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,320
So we'll see what happens.

1242
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:59,120
Yeah, that would just surprise me because they, I feel like they just announced that game and then for it to disappear.

1243
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:06,680
But I mean, everything you're saying logically makes sense that when has that not happened before though, that trailer was supposed to drum up interest.

1244
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,800
That's not happening because of all this other bullshit going on.

1245
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,280
So like, I would have played the crap out of that.

1246
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:12,800
Yeah.

1247
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:13,560
Yeah.

1248
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:23,280
It is interesting though, the idea that they could get acquired, um, and that may be their way, you know, I mean, look at how Activision's getting out of this mess and how we're finally getting rid of Bobby Kotick.

1249
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:35,160
You know, it's going to take two years in Microsoft, but, and maybe that's what happens ultimately with Quantic Dream is, and I can, I could see Sony being a huge partner for them, especially after things like Detroit and so forth.

1250
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,080
Um, they make beautiful games is the thing.

1251
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:53,280
Um, it's just, it would be my hope that they would be able to change themselves enough and prove that they've changed so that they can attract the right kind of people.

1252
01:11:53,320 --> 01:12:04,520
The right kind of talent back to the company and, and really put out another, another masterpiece, but we'll see.

1253
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:06,720
All right.

1254
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,120
Going back to Loki.

1255
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,120
All right.

1256
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:14,320
So we've got an acquisition by Netflix games.

1257
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:25,200
Uh, purchase the developer next games, who is a mobile game developer who has worked on titles like the walking dead, our world, the walking dead, no man's land.

1258
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:37,960
And of course also producing stranger things, puzzle tales, uh, which I think, I think that might be on their service that like a Netflix game service or whatever that they have, uh, with the mobile games.

1259
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:51,280
I think it might be on there, but, um, basically saying that we're excited for next games to join Netflix as a core studio in the strategic region and key talent market expanding our internal game studio capabilities.

1260
01:12:51,920 --> 01:13:00,320
While we're just starting in games, I'm confident that together next games, we'll be able to build a portfolio of world-class games that will delight our members around the world.

1261
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,600
Okay, cool.

1262
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,600
Hope that happens.

1263
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:11,200
Um, so far, I haven't been impressed with anything that Netflix games has had, but I mean, that can turn around.

1264
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:16,640
Obviously they're, you know, they're doing a lot of stuff in the whole, um, you know, movie and TV space.

1265
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,240
So why not?

1266
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,040
It just takes the right game to really get them going, right?

1267
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:28,440
You know, a lot of people were ready to write off Amazon games because it felt like, you know, that first game, I don't even remember where that first game was.

1268
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,920
They launched that flopped.

1269
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,680
Um, and then a new world was taken forever.

1270
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:38,320
But when it launched new world was kind of the talk of the town for about two weeks, and now it's really died out.

1271
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,040
Thank you.

1272
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,760
Crucible since questmaster, that was it.

1273
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,240
Uh, and now lost arc is doing very well for them.

1274
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,840
So, um, you know, it just takes the right game.

1275
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,040
Really get you going and get the buzz going about you.

1276
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,520
Yeah, we'll see.

1277
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:00,760
Um, let's move on to a story, uh, about a game that's been updated and I think this is pretty neat.

1278
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:09,960
Um, it's game called the Haven, which I remember I actually played this because it was on Xbox game pass, but they removed it just in time for this to come out.

1279
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,760
But I think this is neat.

1280
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:23,240
Um, it, and the whole thing is like a love story is really what it's about because our relationships based story, uh, between two characters, you and Kay, and they're on a alien world.

1281
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,720
And they do, they do the part of it.

1282
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,080
Part of it felt like a little bit like flower to me.

1283
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:35,200
Like, I know that seems weird, but the main mechanic of the game kind of, it was like flower a little bit to me, but you're kind of like dashing through landscapes and doing things.

1284
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:48,000
But anyway, um, and, uh, pretty much the way this game has existed for the last, I think about two years that it's been out, uh, you and Kay have been a male female couple.

1285
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,240
Well, a major update just came out and you can change the genders of the couple.

1286
01:14:53,720 --> 01:15:00,120
So now you can play the game if you want as the way it was before a woman and a man, or you can play two women.

1287
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,720
Or you can play two men.

1288
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,040
Um, and this isn't just like a re skinning.

1289
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,760
Uh, they actually went in and, and made this work.

1290
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:18,120
Uh, the characters have been essentially redesigned, but like they still retain elements of like the characters from before.

1291
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,120
Uh, so they, they, they just, it's, it's interesting.

1292
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:30,360
Um, and, uh, let's see, there are three D renders now of both characters, two D assets for the characters, new voices.

1293
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:37,720
So Lexi and Kendrick and Ryan highly voice the new characters, because obviously now there's a new male character and a new female character.

1294
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,320
So they have new voices with that.

1295
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,000
So that's interesting.

1296
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,760
They still have the same personality, the same backstory, the same life.

1297
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:52,080
Uh, they say for technical reasons, it's the same body size, hairstyle and body shape, but I don't think that really matters at the end of the day.

1298
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:59,040
Um, so, and they also redid the written dialogue in all eight languages that Haven is available in.

1299
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:08,400
And any line that has explicit or implicit gender references, they've been modified to work with, um, the new like gender roles.

1300
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,000
So like if you called K Mr.

1301
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,280
Uh, that doesn't work so much anymore.

1302
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,240
So they modified it.

1303
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:25,080
So it's interesting because they say originally the game was going to have eight couples to explore a diverse range of relationships, but that was scaled back.

1304
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:29,880
But this couples update has allowed them to go back and explore some of those ideas.

1305
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:35,200
So that's, that's a very comprehensive update for a game that's been out for a little bit.

1306
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:41,040
And certainly for many people, I think it's going to have them give a second look to a game that they may have skipped before.

1307
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,160
So I think that's pretty.

1308
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,960
All right, well, let's go back.

1309
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,640
Let's go back to a time when, uh, you could not edit a game.

1310
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,360
You, you just, you had the game you had and that's it.

1311
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,520
You couldn't, you couldn't go back and do updates to it.

1312
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,080
Let's, let's roll the bumper.

1313
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:15,080
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1314
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,280
It's time for classic game of the week.

1315
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:22,880
But once a month, dark Sakura mixes it up a little bit.

1316
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,840
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us tonight?

1317
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:35,160
I have the, um, well, it's the handheld of the week and this one is, um, um, uh, I

1318
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:40,680
have no comment it's the game com or game.com as, as it's written.

1319
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,480
It's, it's, uh, why did I pick this anyway?

1320
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,720
Um, it is a fifth generation handheld console by tiger electronics, but I am

1321
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:54,480
considering this just in general, one of those handheld electronics.

1322
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,880
Cause really, have you seen one?

1323
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,880
Um, they had, uh, it was released, um, on September 12th, 1997.

1324
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,320
I think we still have one somewhere?

1325
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,160
Question mark.

1326
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:11,320
Um, there's also a smaller version in mid 1999 called the game.com pocket pro.

1327
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:16,480
And, uh, it had internet because of the.com.

1328
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,640
It had to have internet.

1329
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,480
It was a 14.4 kilobit, uh, per second.

1330
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,160
It's.com.

1331
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:34,920
It sold fewer than 300,000 units and was discontinued in 2000 because of poor sales.

1332
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,240
Yes.

1333
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:46,120
Anyway, the, the, uh, it was, uh, it had brought out this thing called the

1334
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:52,280
R zone console in 1995 to compete with the virtual boy, but it was also a flop.

1335
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:56,560
Um, they also had like the different LCD, of course, games and everything.

1336
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,160
And this is just really more of a cartridge based extension of the

1337
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,040
little tiger electronic handheld games.

1338
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:07,000
Um, so they, uh, surprised anyone would want to compete with the virtual boy.

1339
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:15,520
Less headaches, maybe, but anyway, um, they, uh, they wanted this to come out

1340
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:20,040
as a direct competitor to the game boy, and they were stated as saying that

1341
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:24,600
this would quote, change the gaming world as we know it, and that it

1342
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,280
would be one of the summer's hits.

1343
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:33,120
Um, it was the only new game console of the year at, uh, E3 1997.

1344
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:38,520
They expected it to start selling in July and, uh, they were saying

1345
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:41,480
that it was interesting and called it a game boy for adults.

1346
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:47,960
So it sold for 69.95, had an internet access cartridge,

1347
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,760
uh, for release in October.

1348
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:54,760
The game included with it was Lights Out and Solitaire was built into the console.

1349
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,920
Um, it was marked as Tiger's largest project launch ever.

1350
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:04,280
They had a website at the domain game.com.

1351
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,920
They marketed TV.

1352
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,240
They just had all kinds of business.

1353
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:13,720
It was released in the UK for, uh, uh, 79.99.

1354
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,080
Um, it was black and black and white.

1355
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:24,320
Um, basically just, uh, it had a very similar design to, uh, the game gear,

1356
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,320
but a lot more rectangular, not so sleek.

1357
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,440
Um, it had a larger screen than the game boy and had higher resolution.

1358
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,800
It included a phone directory, a calculator, and a calendar,

1359
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:38,520
um, and had some PDA features.

1360
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,440
So, uh, you know, it was supposed to be kind of cool.

1361
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,320
You know, it was, uh, supposed to be simple, cheap.

1362
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:47,560
It was powered by four AA batteries.

1363
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,240
You had an AC adapter available.

1364
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,280
Um, you also had, uh, what was called the complete.com serial cable.

1365
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:59,800
So you could connect your consoles, uh, to play multiplayer games.

1366
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,840
Uh, there were, uh, two game cartridge slots.

1367
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,160
I thought that, that honestly, I thought that was pretty cool so that you wouldn't

1368
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,560
need to switch out your, your cartridge, but it would allow you to put in like the

1369
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,440
internet cartridge and another game so you could play it online.

1370
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:17,120
Um, it was one of the first, actually it was the first gaming

1371
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,840
console to feature a touch screen.

1372
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:24,680
And, uh, it was also the first handheld console to have internet connectivity.

1373
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:32,440
Um, the monochrome touch screen was, uh, let's see, measures, uh, one and a half

1374
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:38,120
inches by two inches and had a square zones imprinted onto the screen to let

1375
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,200
the players determine where they were going to apply their stylus.

1376
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,840
Um, it, it, uh, the touch screen did not have a backlight.

1377
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:51,640
Um, it, it also was the first internal, uh, sorry, first, uh, handheld system

1378
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:55,760
to have internal memory, which is used to save high scores and contact information.

1379
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:01,840
Um, they then released a smaller version called, uh, the game.com pocket pro.

1380
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:07,240
Um, and it was also shown at E3, uh, May, 1999.

1381
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,520
It was released in June, 1999 for $29.99.

1382
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,520
Had five different colors because of course it did.

1383
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,560
I mean, everyone had to, had to make after Apple that year.

1384
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,840
Um, it actually was completely without color.

1385
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,360
Um, it was designed to be the size of a Game Boy Pocket.

1386
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:28,360
Um, different, you know, screen size.

1387
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,040
It only had one cartridge slot.

1388
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,960
Um, it required two double A batteries.

1389
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,040
It included the directory, a calendar, a calculator,

1390
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,520
but lacked internet capability.

1391
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:40,400
Um, and it was meant to compete with Game Boy Color, but it didn't have color.

1392
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:46,760
So, um, going back to those internet features though, um, it had a cartridge,

1393
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:51,640
um, it required a cartridge and a dial-up modem, neither came with the system.

1394
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:57,280
You could read email, it could, it could be read and sent on the

1395
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,920
gameboy.com using that cartridge.

1396
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:04,120
Um, it supported text only web browsing through, uh, the internet service

1397
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:08,920
providers, um, you could not save your email though, to the internal memory.

1398
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:15,880
Um, and, uh, you had to use the internet surface, uh, service through Delphi that

1399
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:21,040
was made specifically to work on the game.com, um, the web link cartridge

1400
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:26,280
came out that allowed players to connect to their, uh, computer and using that

1401
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,640
cartridge, they could upload their high scores to the game.com website,

1402
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,800
uh, to be, uh, listed on webpage.

1403
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,000
And, uh, none of those games, even though they had the internet, the

1404
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,240
cartridge that you could use at the same time, none of those supported any kind

1405
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,880
of internet features with the games.

1406
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,440
So when they came out.

1407
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:50,880
So overall, um, uh, the audio for it was, uh, was mono, um, two 4-bit waveform

1408
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,680
generators, uh, with their own frequency, volume control and waveform data,

1409
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,880
and noise generator and one direct 8-bit PCM output channel.

1410
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:02,880
Um, a handful of games came out for it.

1411
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:08,640
It had a really, really light, uh, light, uh, library.

1412
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:09,440
That's what I'm thinking of.

1413
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:15,600
Um, it, they plan to have like a dozen games available when it came out, but,

1414
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,280
uh, yeah, they, uh, that didn't happen.

1415
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:25,880
Um, so the games themselves, um, were on 16 megabit cartridges.

1416
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:30,280
Um, they were ranged between $19 and $29.

1417
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,880
Um, the games that came out, there were the, there are 20 games.

1418
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:37,920
Most of them developed, uh, internally by Tiger, apart from Solitaire.

1419
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,920
Well, actually Solitaire is included.

1420
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,760
There was Solitaire, Batman and Robin, Centipede, Duke Nukem 3D, Fighters,

1421
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:50,320
Megamix, Frogger, Henry, Indy 500, Jeopardy, Lights Out, which was the pack-in,

1422
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,960
uh, Lost World, Jurassic Park, Monopoly, Mortal Kombat trilogy, Quiz Whiz,

1423
01:24:54,960 --> 01:25:00,640
Cyber Trivia, Resident Evil 2, um, which I know is one of the ones I had, Scrabble,

1424
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:04,880
Sonic Jam, Tiger Casino, Wheel of Fortune, Wheel of Fortune 2, and Williams Arcade

1425
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:05,480
Classics.

1426
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:09,840
Um, they were supposed to have a version of Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1427
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:18,080
Um, like a Furby game, Metal Gear Solid, um, Sonic 3D Blast, uh, a WCW game,

1428
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,360
Truck Dinosaur Hunter.

1429
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,120
There, there are some titles that were planned for it, but yeah.

1430
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,440
Let's be real.

1431
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,880
Thank God we never saw the horror of Symphony of the Night on this pizza

1432
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,480
garbage.

1433
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:33,520
Like looking at Resident Evil 2, which is what we're looking at as the, um, we're

1434
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,600
broadcasting live on Twitch.

1435
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,000
Like, I'm sorry, this was like garbage.

1436
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,280
Like it's two frames a second.

1437
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:38,320
Mission chat.

1438
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,600
It looks like a CDI game, honestly.

1439
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,160
Like it looks like a CDI Zelda game.

1440
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,160
It's, it's not, that's not a compliment.

1441
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:48,080
This, this is exactly what it played like.

1442
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,960
Um, but at any rate, like it had such negative reviews about it.

1443
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,160
Um, although the Wisconsin State Journal said that there was some serious

1444
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:03,320
advantages over the Game Boy, including the touch screen, but, um, the, the

1445
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:06,800
processor was only, gave it marginal improvements to the Game Boy.

1446
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,880
And the thing is, is that Tiger, apparently from the looks of it, didn't

1447
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:16,520
know their system to program it as well as Nintendo did, or else they would have

1448
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,240
been able to work around those limitations.

1449
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:24,960
Um, it does have a, uh, a lasting legacy though of, uh, of having been

1450
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,240
a system that really, really tried.

1451
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:31,840
There was apparently really good audio that came out of those speakers.

1452
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:38,400
Um, the PDA functionality for when it came out was a big factor for it, sort

1453
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:45,080
of gave it that, uh, adult, you know, appeal, but it had some of the most

1454
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:49,640
disappointing games that were made even worse by the outdated screen.

1455
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:50,520
And that is a quote.

1456
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:59,640
Um, so yeah, this basically is, uh, it's been listed as one of the worst

1457
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:04,320
consoles of all time, especially because of the low screen quality

1458
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:08,560
and it's a very, uh, thin library.

1459
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:14,000
Um, Nadia Oxford of US gamers, uh, said it died in record time because

1460
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,760
it was poorly made to say the least.

1461
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,040
So a legacy of failure, game.com.

1462
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,560
Print that on the back of the box.

1463
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:30,400
Um, I, when you, when you say you tried is kind of the takeaway from this.

1464
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,000
I laughed.

1465
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:31,440
You didn't.

1466
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:33,760
Oh, I'm just laughing.

1467
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,760
Cause I just see that gold star where it's written in comic sans.

1468
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:37,360
You tried.

1469
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:42,640
Oh, this, the star is lopsided and tigers would be the lopsided one.

1470
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,240
This is fuck you.

1471
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:43,680
I tried.

1472
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:44,600
Or fuck you.

1473
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:45,320
I did a good job.

1474
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:51,800
And everyone else would just be shaking their head and say, Oh honey, no.

1475
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,520
All right.

1476
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,640
Everyone else would just give it like this, like puce colored star that just

1477
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:05,800
says, no, the classic handheld of the month, uh, the game.com not, not

1478
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,840
everything, not everything as a highlight.

1479
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:13,200
So sometimes this isn't even a low light low light at least makes hair look pretty.

1480
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:16,040
This isn't even that sometimes.

1481
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,080
Sometimes backlight is like a flat shaded mid tone.

1482
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:22,640
Sometimes we have to look back at our mistakes.

1483
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:28,960
Anyway, uh, the classic handheld of the month, uh, once a month dark

1484
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:34,120
soccer in the year 2022 is picking a classic or at least notable, maybe

1485
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:38,360
as a better word handheld, I don't even know if this was notable to be honest.

1486
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,960
It, it did.

1487
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:44,960
It, it did garner attention because again, it was the first touch screen

1488
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,360
on a handheld first internal memory.

1489
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:52,200
It had some ambitious capabilities to it, but it's too bad.

1490
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:57,160
The rest of it flopped, but if they had put time into a better screen on this

1491
01:28:57,160 --> 01:29:03,280
thing and up to the price point by like 10 bucks, that would have been a lot better.

1492
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:08,320
I mean, bump the processor a bit, put a better screen and it could have,

1493
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,480
it could have been something, it could have been a contender.

1494
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:15,000
If they upgraded it to the point where it wasn't the thing that

1495
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,800
it was, it would have been great.

1496
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:23,480
But, but you do say what I mean though, about, you know, the touch screen

1497
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:27,440
and that touch screen, we eventually got them in our handheld consoles.

1498
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:31,040
Our phones are, you know, that I try to look for my phone when

1499
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,000
I'm using it as my webcam.

1500
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:35,520
Um, but we had that capability there.

1501
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:41,760
I mean, this was one of the things that paved the way for what we expect out of,

1502
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:46,480
you know, some of our modern handheld consoles and our phones and, and the

1503
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:50,600
like, the internal memory was a big thing, having it act as a PDA was a big thing.

1504
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,880
It was just like, what was, what were the PDAs at the time?

1505
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:55,680
Not the Blackberry.

1506
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,120
This was before Blackberry, I think.

1507
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:58,280
A beeper?

1508
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,800
Like, hmm?

1509
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:00,840
A beeper?

1510
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:02,600
No, no, no, no.

1511
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,640
It was like the big silver ones that-

1512
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,840
Palm Pilot says-

1513
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,160
Palm Pilot, yeah.

1514
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:12,440
It was, it was like, it was, I think it was trying to do too much.

1515
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:14,360
Perhaps.

1516
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:19,080
If it, if that capability had been sent into the games and the display

1517
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,520
instead of all that other business.

1518
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:27,440
I think it also stands as a symbol of that era where everything was dot com.

1519
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,840
You just, you just have to put the internet in everything and it's, and

1520
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,800
honestly, cause we know, I mean, not every, not everybody knows because

1521
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,880
some of you weren't born yet.

1522
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:43,960
I was at the grocery store yesterday, somebody behind me buying liquor and

1523
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,720
the cashier says, when were you born?

1524
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,960
The person says 1997.

1525
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:51,520
And I'm like, ah, I'm so upset right now.

1526
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,640
Anyway, I'm just saying, you all will feel it too someday.

1527
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:00,200
If you're sitting there going, I was born in 97, you'll, you will understand

1528
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:03,000
my pain someday, someday, bitch, someday.

1529
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,200
By the way, Bobby would be proud of me.

1530
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:11,120
Normally when I go to Daiso, they're playing like K-pop, they were actually

1531
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:15,560
playing like seventies and eighties rock.

1532
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,840
And one person's like, Oh my God, what's this?

1533
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,880
I'm like, don't you dare say anything bad about Rush.

1534
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,680
I will end you.

1535
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:28,800
And they looked over at me and like, and then I hear from another aisle.

1536
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,120
Yeah.

1537
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,320
That happened at Daiso today.

1538
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:41,320
Uh, DJ Rama S says, I feel this anytime I hear eighties and nineties

1539
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:42,600
music on the classic stations.

1540
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,880
Oh, it's even worse now.

1541
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,000
It's like early 2000s.

1542
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,640
Oh yeah.

1543
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:46,240
That's agreed.

1544
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,520
Oh no, you'll hear, I heard, I heard chili peppers on there actually.

1545
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,720
Not like they're eighties.

1546
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,720
They were playing like into, into like nineties stuff.

1547
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,880
I heard Linkin Park on the classic rock station the other day.

1548
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,080
And I was like, just take me now.

1549
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:05,680
Well, what gets me is what the easy listening station sounds like now.

1550
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:09,960
Like, am I, I remember when my mother would listen to the easy, easy

1551
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,520
listening station, it was always captain and Tennille's muskrat

1552
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,560
love on at any given moment.

1553
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:15,960
I kid you not.

1554
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,720
I've heard that song more often than I ever wanted to in my life.

1555
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,880
Bobby Blackwolf points out Turner classic movies plays the matrix, a movie that was

1556
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,800
released the same year as the game.com.

1557
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,440
All right, I'm done.

1558
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:36,240
All of the hosts, all of the hosts in unison were like, one, two, all of

1559
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:44,800
the hosts in unison were like one, two, three, baseball at desk.

1560
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,400
We don't need one, two switch.

1561
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,600
We need one, two, what the fuck?

1562
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:51,160
All right.

1563
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,120
Anyway, uh, moving it.

1564
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,920
That was also weird.

1565
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:57,400
Cause when you turned off your camera, like they got to see the, the preview

1566
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:01,840
shot and it went into infinity mirror mode where he saw the same shot over and over.

1567
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:03,600
All right.

1568
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:07,360
Anyway, uh, let's move on quickly.

1569
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,120
We need to, we need to make ourselves feel better.

1570
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,720
Let's do some rapid fire news.

1571
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,720
I hope the news is good.

1572
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,720
We'll travel around the industry quickly and look at some big headlines.

1573
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,920
Uh, Loki, we'll start with you.

1574
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,240
Yeah, we have another fundraiser going on with itch IO.

1575
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:25,920
So this is where you can get almost 500 games for $5 through itch IO and it's to

1576
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:31,760
help the Texas trends community, because if you, uh, are not familiar with what's

1577
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:36,480
going on in the United States and specifically Texas and Florida, lots of

1578
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:41,640
horrible things when it comes to, um, marginalized communities.

1579
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:42,760
So that's great.

1580
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:45,680
Thank you, thank you, Texas for being Texas.

1581
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:49,520
Um, but at least this will hopefully help the fight against that.

1582
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,160
So you can, uh, check that out on itch IO.

1583
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,400
That's a great cause.

1584
01:33:54,400 --> 01:34:00,120
I mean, fuck all of that going on in Texas, that goes without saying and, uh, props

1585
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:02,720
to the district attorneys that are standing up against it saying they're not

1586
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,600
going to enforce it.

1587
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:10,440
Um, but, uh, I I'm very, it always warms my heart just a little bit when I see

1588
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:14,120
gaming companies, especially the indie developers who quite frankly could use

1589
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:19,520
that money themselves, um, getting in on this sort of action, this really lovely

1590
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:20,560
Yeah.

1591
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:25,040
And it, it, the, the bundle in case you're looking for it is called TT RPGs for

1592
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,680
trans rights in Texas bundle.

1593
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:35,720
Um, so just search for that, um, on itch IO and then, um, so apparently the cuphead

1594
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,800
show, which came out, I have not watched it.

1595
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,720
My son binge watched the whole thing.

1596
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,720
He said it was all right.

1597
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,760
Um, so it's been renewed for a second season.

1598
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,760
So apparently it is somewhat popular.

1599
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,560
Um, so yeah, check it out on Netflix.

1600
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,400
If you haven't seen it yet.

1601
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,800
Have you heard the social media discourse on this?

1602
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,560
Apparently one of the people, one of the people behind the scenes on this came out

1603
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:03,000
and said, well, it's not really season two, it's the second half of episodes for

1604
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,200
season one, and they're doing this to screw us all in our contracts and

1605
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,360
animation gets treated like this all the time.

1606
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:13,120
How do you think your animated series get turned around so fast and

1607
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,560
suddenly there's new episodes?

1608
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,840
So I thought, I thought that was interesting.

1609
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,080
I mean, you know, obviously it doesn't, it doesn't lessen the quality of the

1610
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:22,680
show or anything like that, but it just, it's just basically the whole thing

1611
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:25,520
is to make Netflix look like assholes, you know, basically.

1612
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,040
Um, but I thought, I thought that was interesting.

1613
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:29,200
Mike deaf points out.

1614
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,560
There are already 36 episodes in production.

1615
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:36,640
So it's, it's not really a season two, but it's a continuation

1616
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:37,440
of what already exists.

1617
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:41,480
However, yeah, that there are more episodes.

1618
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:45,520
Um, uh, Bobby Blackwell says contractually, they get a three point three to

1619
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,480
five percent raise for a second season.

1620
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:51,080
Netflix bought one season and is batching them.

1621
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:51,960
That's what it is.

1622
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,480
That's how they're getting screwed out of it.

1623
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:58,120
Just something to think about.

1624
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:01,000
I mean, not that it should necessarily stop you from watching or supporting

1625
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,960
the show, but maybe buy some merch or put money into the creator's

1626
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,160
pockets, uh, another way to, all right.

1627
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,600
Uh, anyhow, dark soccer.

1628
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:15,160
Well, um, there is a game called Mina, the hollower that is going to have guest

1629
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:20,880
tracks from the legendary Yuzo Koshiro as in, you know, the, the person that

1630
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,560
gave us the music and streets of rage act, razor, uh, super smash brothers,

1631
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,040
I train Odyssey, um, uh, one gun, midnight, maximum tune.

1632
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:33,840
Uh, I am, I'm honestly, I think that this would make me just want to play the game

1633
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,880
anyway, but the game looks actually really whimsical and very cool.

1634
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:39,720
So I might, I might be giving that one a try.

1635
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:45,560
Um, also, uh, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3, and Resident Evil 7

1636
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:52,040
Biohazard are, uh, coming to PS5 and Xbox series in 2022.

1637
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:58,280
Um, so Capcom is going to be releasing those a little bit later this year.

1638
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:03,680
If you already have them on PS4 or Xbox one, you can upgrade, uh, their

1639
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:07,760
versions for the PS5 or Xbox series version at no additional cost.

1640
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:12,960
Um, there will be, uh, upgrade patches available for PC users.

1641
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:18,480
And I guess if you are on Stadia, like me, you don't have to wait

1642
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,840
for a patch, it just happens.

1643
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:21,560
Magic.

1644
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:28,480
Oh, I still have my moments of giggle when Tuesdays and Steam goes down for

1645
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,200
maintenance just for Dead by Daylight.

1646
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,600
And I'm like, I'm playing right now.

1647
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,840
Oh yeah.

1648
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,520
Is it harder to get in a match though?

1649
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,760
I guess you still have all the console people.

1650
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:36,560
No.

1651
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:37,280
Yeah.

1652
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:41,000
And there are other Stadia, you know, gamers out there.

1653
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,000
Not just me.

1654
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:43,120
Yeah.

1655
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:43,880
It's yeah.

1656
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:46,480
Mostly I get into matches against, uh, console players.

1657
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,760
It is definitely a drinking game though.

1658
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:52,280
When you see it, what is this food that Alan is offering me off camera?

1659
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,840
These are these, these chips you were talking about earlier.

1660
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:55,720
Okay.

1661
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,160
Wait, can you, can you lean in the mic and say what this is?

1662
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,000
Yes.

1663
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,840
Pajama pants on it.

1664
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:05,600
Well, you gotta lean in there and say, you know, chip.

1665
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:08,600
There.

1666
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:11,080
They can't hear you.

1667
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,000
You're under the noise gate.

1668
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:12,800
You gotta get a lot closer.

1669
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,000
Oh, the tips are made of meat.

1670
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:18,760
They're keto chips, protein, and they're very thinly sliced.

1671
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:19,320
Yum.

1672
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:20,440
Yes.

1673
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,520
Meat's good.

1674
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,760
That's not the worst thing I've ever had.

1675
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:30,520
I was expecting it worse, but I wouldn't want to like eat an entire bag of those,

1676
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:31,360
but I guess that's the point.

1677
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:32,880
Anyway.

1678
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:34,480
Sorry about that.

1679
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,880
Microwave bacon enough and it'll become chip like.

1680
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,400
Oh, that's a horrible aftertaste though.

1681
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:39,920
Blah.

1682
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,920
Uh, DJ Rama says, is that Alan or evil Alan?

1683
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,120
Okay.

1684
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:47,720
So for those on the podcast, Alan has a very full beard right now and it's something

1685
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,360
his hairstylist talked him into doing.

1686
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,920
And it is, it is a very, it is a lovely beard.

1687
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:57,400
Um, so it's, it's something he's, I will be losing my beard in the next, uh, probably

1688
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:57,960
next week.

1689
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:58,800
I will not have it.

1690
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,600
So my suspicion I believe is correct.

1691
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:02,600
So what's that?

1692
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,200
My suspicion I believe is correct.

1693
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:06,400
Potentially.

1694
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:07,160
I'll text you.

1695
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:08,360
So, okay.

1696
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:09,560
All right.

1697
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,560
But, uh, yeah, my, I'm going to be losing my beard for about a month.

1698
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:14,240
All right.

1699
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:19,680
Um, moving on, let's, uh, travel around the world and check out some, we get both

1700
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,400
your stories, dark soccer.

1701
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:20,840
I'm sorry.

1702
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:21,680
Yeah.

1703
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:22,120
Okay.

1704
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,400
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1705
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,240
Starting in the U S all right.

1706
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:32,520
So we've got spell force three re-forced on PlayStation four, PlayStation five,

1707
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:39,760
Xbox one, Xbox series, uh, dot hack GU last recode on Nintendo switch, Aztec

1708
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:44,320
forgotten gods on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox

1709
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:49,400
one and Xbox series, chocobo GP on Nintendo switch.

1710
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:54,760
And I can't pronounce this one, but we're going to try.

1711
01:39:54,800 --> 01:40:01,240
Uh, it's looks like, uh, don't use say bang in summer on PC.

1712
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:05,280
And then of course, WWE two K 22.

1713
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:09,160
Hopefully this one doesn't suck on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation

1714
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,840
five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

1715
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:14,240
That's seriously this subtitle on it that I added.

1716
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:16,640
All right.

1717
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:19,480
Uh, let's go to Japan right now.

1718
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,160
Get in the plane.

1719
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,400
Um, on the Nintendo switch this week in Japan.

1720
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,560
Oh, this is exciting.

1721
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:29,400
Dot hack GU last recode is out on the switch this week.

1722
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:34,840
Is this the, is this a remake of like the whole, or is this just one of the games?

1723
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:40,080
Uh, it is four parts from volumes one to volume four rebirth,

1724
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,000
reminisce, redemption, and reconnection.

1725
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:43,000
Okay.

1726
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:49,600
So that is out, uh, this week in Japan on the 10th, uh, on Mario day, uh, also coming

1727
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,480
out on the Nintendo switch this week, chocobo GP a Yay.

1728
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,440
I'm excited to play that.

1729
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:55,080
That's for sure.

1730
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,960
Um, hopefully it's not too micro.

1731
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:02,440
As you know, square Enix is in hot water right now for microtransactions, because

1732
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:05,160
apparently that Babylon's fall game.

1733
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,760
We didn't talk a lot about that.

1734
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:13,520
Babylon's fall game is apparently flopped fucking hard because, uh, steam

1735
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:17,040
is only showing that like a thousand people were playing it at its peak.

1736
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,360
And that's barely Babylon's fall.

1737
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:19,840
Yeah.

1738
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:20,720
Babylon's fall.

1739
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:24,600
Uh, is that, uh, that is the game that square Enix made with platinum

1740
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,960
games, uh, it was also in the news because it was reusing some of the

1741
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:32,640
assets from final fantasy 14, uh, there it's, it seems like it's like, it's

1742
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:35,800
this full price game and it's like a micro microtransaction paradise.

1743
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,880
Apparently, but a lot of people were looking forward to platinum and

1744
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,080
square Enix getting together.

1745
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,840
And apparently it is not worth the wait.

1746
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:46,640
Um, it is very obviously shoehorned full of microtransactions and quite frankly

1747
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,120
probably should have been play.

1748
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:52,040
Um, so anyway, uh, yeah.

1749
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:55,480
Some folks in chat quest buster says, Oh no, Babylon's fall.

1750
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:56,320
Uh, orange.

1751
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:56,560
Right.

1752
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,920
Says Babylon's fail indeed.

1753
01:41:59,440 --> 01:41:59,920
Or no.

1754
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:00,920
Oh no.

1755
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:01,920
It says Babylon's fall.

1756
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:02,240
Indeed.

1757
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:05,480
I read that like Babylon's fail, but that's almost even better.

1758
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:05,800
Orange.

1759
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:05,960
Right.

1760
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:06,920
I made your comment better.

1761
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:09,560
See you in the intro tonight.

1762
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,720
I said Babylon's flop.

1763
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,400
I should have done Babylon fail.

1764
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,720
Oh, there's always next week.

1765
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:14,120
All right.

1766
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:17,120
Uh, let's see what else do we want to do for release dates?

1767
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:17,440
Oh yes.

1768
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,200
Back to Japan.

1769
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:18,560
Sorry.

1770
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:21,320
Let's talk about the games coming out next week and on the PlayStation

1771
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:25,920
five, uh, the medium gets a Japanese release on the PlayStation five.

1772
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,960
I believe that was exclusive to series X on the U S so that probably

1773
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:34,480
explains that and then a sass is creed Valhalla, the Ragnarok edition is out

1774
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,680
on the PlayStation five this week.

1775
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,000
Can a dark Sakura.

1776
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:40,440
What do you have?

1777
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:47,200
So we have, uh, coming out, we have on the eighth for PlayStation and

1778
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:50,280
Xbox, we have WWE, two K 22 deluxe edition.

1779
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:54,280
On the 10th for the same, we have assassin's creed Valhalla, Donna

1780
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:59,520
Ragnarok, we have also on the 10th chocobo GP for the switch.

1781
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:02,840
Um, the rest of these are on the 11th.

1782
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:07,080
We have road redemption for PlayStation hotel, Transylvania, scary

1783
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:09,280
tales adventure for the big three.

1784
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:13,920
W W E E two K 22 for PlayStation, Xbox.

1785
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:18,800
Hula on, uh, March 11th again for PlayStation and switch.

1786
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,480
And that will do it.

1787
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,120
All right.

1788
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:25,800
We just have a few more stories for you guys, and then we're

1789
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,600
going to get to some emails.

1790
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:31,480
I know we have at least one email tonight and, uh, we will have maybe some calls.

1791
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:32,480
We'll see what happens there.

1792
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:38,120
So, uh, in the meantime, let's get to our next story.

1793
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:39,520
Yeah, I believe it.

1794
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:45,120
So, so Sony, um, is basically, or Sony air active entertainment.

1795
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:49,600
Japan has announced that they're going to be ending support or after

1796
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:54,360
sales support, so the repairs refurbishment of anything, uh, PlayStation

1797
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:59,880
three hardware peripherals as of April 30th, 2022, they're citing that it's

1798
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:04,280
due to the lack of parts and their inventory, and they'll no longer be

1799
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:10,160
able to provide those services after, um, that date, of course, I'm sure

1800
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:12,760
there's aftermarket stuff that you could do to fix your consoles if you

1801
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:16,800
need to, but, uh, Sony themselves will not be supporting the PlayStation

1802
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,000
three any longer, which I mean, it makes sense.

1803
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:23,040
It's been out of circulation for quite a while now.

1804
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,800
So not surprised.

1805
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,280
Um, yeah.

1806
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:32,160
All right.

1807
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:37,280
So, I mean, it seems like Tony's just been trying to slowly get the PlayStation

1808
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:41,400
three and the PlayStation Vita, like outside of the, like, you know, slowly

1809
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:45,960
getting it out, um, but, uh, and this kind of goes right along with that.

1810
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,760
How long until they officially try to shut down the stores again

1811
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,800
online and not get no idea.

1812
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:55,440
All right.

1813
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,400
Uh, well, something I think we're a little more excited about, at least

1814
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,560
I I'm, I I'm interested in this dark soccer.

1815
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,680
I imagine you have to be right.

1816
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:04,880
Oh yeah.

1817
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,960
Um, so, uh, all right.

1818
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:10,480
I have, I have to, I have to phrase this in one particular way.

1819
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:11,400
I'm getting this.

1820
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:13,280
We're starting off with that.

1821
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,280
It will happen.

1822
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:17,360
And I'll tell you how I heard about it was watching one of

1823
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:20,320
polyester's, uh, YouTube, uh, things.

1824
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:24,360
Cause usually I'll get like blood point codes from him first.

1825
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:31,680
Um, but he talks about, um, uh, a tweet that behavior made in conjunction

1826
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:36,520
with level 99 games, uh, which is a group that has done like video game

1827
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,640
inspired board games and card games.

1828
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,200
They are doing a dead by daylight game.

1829
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:45,000
And, uh, there's a Kickstarter launching on March 29th.

1830
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,960
Um, I, I am going to have this game.

1831
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:53,480
There will be a standard edition for $49.99 with six killers and seven

1832
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:57,840
survivors and two maps and the collector's edition with 16 killers, 17

1833
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,920
survivors and four maps for a hundred bucks.

1834
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:05,040
Um, this is, if someone wants to get me a birthday present, by the way, you

1835
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,720
know, this, this order is coming up for my birthday.

1836
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:14,320
Um, and I, I imagine none of the licensed killers that, you know, DVD is known for,

1837
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:17,000
I imagine they would have to license those separately for this.

1838
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,520
So we probably won't see any of them.

1839
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:19,640
Yeah.

1840
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:25,720
Like among the ones I could see, we have like a, a nurse, we have a trapper.

1841
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:31,240
We have a, a DeWitt, we have a, a Meglet, we have a Jake characters.

1842
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,680
You know, I'm really surprised.

1843
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:34,560
I know we talk about this game a lot on the show.

1844
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,520
I'm sorry, but also not sorry because you know, not sorry at all.

1845
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:38,440
It's been around a while.

1846
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:43,360
Um, but I'm kind of surprised they haven't tried to make, I haven't, I'm

1847
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:46,640
surprised it hasn't gone full circle where they haven't tried to make a

1848
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:47,920
horror movie out of it yet.

1849
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:52,200
I mean, maybe it would just be a very hard story to write because, um, you

1850
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:55,160
know, like without getting too in the weeds, I don't want to go too far into

1851
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:58,160
it for the people who aren't into Dead by Daylight, but basically it's like,

1852
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:02,920
you know, they exist in this place where they fight and fight and fight again.

1853
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,040
Basically they're for the entity's amusement.

1854
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:06,480
They are, you know, dying over and over.

1855
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:09,600
It's not for the, as far as I'm aware, it's not actually for the entity's

1856
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,680
amusements, it's for the entity's nourishment.

1857
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,600
Ah, okay.

1858
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:16,800
So, well, you know, eating makes me happy, but anyway, yes, yes.

1859
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,920
For the entity's nourishment.

1860
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:22,080
So, but it's just surprising that there is, hasn't been a movie to try to, you

1861
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:27,720
know, to, for things to come full circle where like Dwight, Meg, Claudette, you

1862
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:34,280
know, the hag, the trapper, the doctor are not like horror icons in cinema as well.

1863
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:36,320
I'm really surprised that hasn't happened yet.

1864
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,640
Somebody's gotta be pitching it or trying it, but it's going to take

1865
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:41,160
the right script to make it work.

1866
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,320
Because again, I don't know how it works as a movie.

1867
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:47,400
I'll tell you what though, and it's a long read.

1868
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:47,680
Okay.

1869
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,880
It is a long and glorious read.

1870
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:55,120
It's like a 70 chapter fanfic that I found and read to its completion because

1871
01:47:55,120 --> 01:48:01,960
it was as good as any novel that I have read, amazing writing, um, all of the

1872
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:05,960
characters were very fleshed out, you know, very headcanony, um, and there's

1873
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:11,680
one thing that, that I like good fanfiction, I'm a fanfic writer myself.

1874
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:16,320
Um, there's one thing that is in lore that never made sense to me, and that's

1875
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:21,480
that the survivors forget everything after they've come out of a match, but

1876
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:27,040
yet they, they're talking about having been in their matches and, and things.

1877
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:32,920
So that's sort of like a inconsistency in lore, but, uh, I'll have to find this

1878
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:36,040
story, I'm going to have to put it somewhere for people to read because

1879
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:40,680
it is absolutely amazing, and if somebody wants like their ultimate

1880
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:44,480
Dead by Daylight story, you need to read this one, it's really good.

1881
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:50,200
So, um, at any rate, I was gonna say, Tiger Claw in Chat asks, the question

1882
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,120
is, will the movie version be any good?

1883
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:56,040
Well, if the track record for video game movies tells us anything,

1884
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:57,480
the answer is probably not.

1885
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,560
Um, although I guess recent, recently they've been getting better.

1886
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,160
I mean, a lot of people enjoyed the Sonic movie, the new Mortal

1887
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:06,960
Combat apparently didn't suck, you know, apparently they're getting better.

1888
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:08,800
Um, but they still got a ways to go.

1889
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:15,800
Well, I think, I think that's entirely possible for like, if it were me, I

1890
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:21,920
would actually budget for a trilogy and have like different aspects, like be,

1891
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,880
you know, the, like the first movie, the first main four, and maybe the

1892
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:28,440
first three original killers.

1893
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:28,920
What was it?

1894
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:31,880
Trapper Billy and, uh, Wraith?

1895
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,280
Yeah, Trapper Billy and Wraith.

1896
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:36,160
Maybe throw Sally in there cause she was the fourth, the nurse.

1897
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:41,880
And have it be like their interaction, you know, stuff like that.

1898
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:45,040
Like I'd even like throw in stuff from the killer's perspective.

1899
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:48,320
Like they're like, maybe they were tricked into doing it or forced into

1900
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:51,320
doing it or have no choice but to do it or they get punished or something like that.

1901
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:55,400
And then the second one, move on to like a different DLC group, you know,

1902
01:49:55,400 --> 01:50:00,320
bring in like Kate and, and the clown and, you know, clown would be creepy

1903
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:03,280
as fuck in a movie, nevermind, um, but do something like that.

1904
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:06,960
Like I would, I would watch it, even if it's not great, I would probably

1905
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,960
still watch it cause I mean, you know, the kind of shit movies I like.

1906
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:11,440
And also most horror movies.

1907
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:14,680
And I, I say, you know, you all know how I feel about gore and stuff like that,

1908
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:20,240
but even like the most horror movies aren't great there, but they're

1909
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:21,920
comfort food for a lot of people.

1910
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:24,240
And as I'm getting to know more and more people in the community and

1911
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:25,680
it's, it's, it's comfort food.

1912
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:27,800
It's not great necessarily.

1913
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,280
Like, like most comfort food.

1914
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,080
Um, let's see.

1915
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:34,640
Um, and Tiger Claw to answer your question, there's not really a main

1916
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:36,280
character, although people will say Dwight.

1917
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:40,880
Um, it's, it doesn't really have a major narrative.

1918
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:44,840
Some of the lore is really inconsistent with itself and like for the ones

1919
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:49,960
that borrow from franchises, those, actually, I'll take that back.

1920
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,960
Most of the, most of those actually had to have some rewriting done to them.

1921
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:57,760
Um, although, uh, the pig from Saw, her stuff is actually pretty consistent.

1922
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:04,240
And, um, the Sadako one is actually official, officially recognized, uh, by

1923
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:10,600
the, the, the owner of, of the whole Ringu franchise, including making Yoichi,

1924
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:16,440
who was a kid in the first two movies, uh, actually making his adulthood story canon.

1925
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:22,840
For, so Sadako and Yoichi in Dead by Daylight is canon for the

1926
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,960
Ringu universe.

1927
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:26,760
They, they really, and, you know, again, I know we talk a lot about this game,

1928
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:30,200
but they, they really went out of their way to make Sadako work in Dead by

1929
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:34,280
Daylight too, because they, they made the care to believe Sadako doesn't

1930
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:38,760
kill anyone by her own hand and they really, they really went out of their

1931
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:42,120
way with the graphics and everything to make it so that she's using psychic

1932
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:44,320
abilities, everything she does is psychic abilities.

1933
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:50,320
That was actually a, um, uh, a requirement put out by, was it Kodansha?

1934
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:51,760
I think it was Kodansha or Kadokawa.

1935
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:52,960
I have to look them up again.

1936
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:55,960
Um, but it was actually a requirement of the company

1937
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,160
that she not touch anybody.

1938
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:05,760
Um, so that led to that, that the TVs be present, that the, the tape be included

1939
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:09,280
in it, that, you know, her story involved, you know, water for some reason.

1940
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,320
Well, I mean, I know why it involved water, but that's going back to the story.

1941
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:15,760
Um, there is actually one other little bit of Dead by Daylight news.

1942
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:16,800
Okay.

1943
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,200
Quickly.

1944
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:18,160
All right.

1945
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:25,120
They, um, according to DBD leaks, um, they have, uh, uh, trademarked, hooked

1946
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:27,840
on you a Dead by Daylight dating sim.

1947
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:30,680
Is this, I thought I just wrote that off as bullshit.

1948
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:31,520
This is real.

1949
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:32,720
This is real.

1950
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:35,960
It maybe it's gotta be an April fool's prank in the game.

1951
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:37,320
It's gotta be.

1952
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,760
This was on February 21st.

1953
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:40,760
Oh Lord.

1954
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:41,840
It's gotta be a tome.

1955
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:43,160
Gonna be a prank.

1956
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,520
Um, all right.

1957
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,840
Filed on February 16th, 2022.

1958
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:50,200
This is computer video game, combat discards, your blah, blah, blah.

1959
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:52,120
Mobile device possibly.

1960
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:57,680
Um, but this is, uh, actually saying a downloadable computer software for

1961
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:59,640
mobile phone games for playing video games.

1962
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:03,320
This is actually registered as a full game.

1963
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:05,480
Let me Loki.

1964
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:07,040
I know you don't follow dead by daylight.

1965
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,840
So let me try to explain this to you.

1966
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:11,560
Just how horny most of the DBD community is.

1967
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,120
Oh, we got some thirsty people.

1968
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:15,480
So internet community, horny.

1969
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:21,800
Anytime, anytime the official DBD makes a post, the first reply, the top

1970
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:23,840
reply will always inevitably be B.

1971
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:26,760
When are you adding sex to death by daylight?

1972
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:32,520
Or people saying in order to die in a horror movie, you have to have sex first.

1973
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:35,120
When will Dwight and David be able to have sex?

1974
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,360
Always.

1975
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:40,760
Always.

1976
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:43,400
And then look at the fan art.

1977
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,000
I'm not even going to go there.

1978
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:48,640
The fan art there's, there's choices.

1979
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:51,000
There's some choices that people are making in the fan art.

1980
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:51,440
Okay.

1981
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:51,840
Anyway.

1982
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:56,120
Um, I do want to say real quick, because going back to video game movies,

1983
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:58,560
tiger claw reminded me, Oh yeah.

1984
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:01,080
One just came out completely.

1985
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:02,840
Didn't even notice for me.

1986
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,760
And the uncharted movie.

1987
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:05,280
Hello.

1988
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:06,640
Did y'all know?

1989
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,320
And yeah, right.

1990
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:09,840
I was like, Oh, I knew it came out.

1991
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,120
I had no interest in it.

1992
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:11,880
Yeah.

1993
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:13,120
They did do an uncharted movie.

1994
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:13,800
Didn't they?

1995
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,080
All right.

1996
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:17,800
All right.

1997
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:18,520
Let's move on.

1998
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:19,160
Let's move on.

1999
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:22,200
Uh, if you dated Sally, would she be into asphyxiation?

2000
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:23,880
Oh no, don't stop.

2001
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:24,160
All right.

2002
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,080
Uh, moving on Loki.

2003
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:32,120
So Tokyo game show this year is actually going to be returning as a physical event.

2004
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:39,240
Um, I guess it, you know, events are starting to go physical again because

2005
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:44,200
you know, it's starting to become, you know, an endemic, I guess.

2006
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:49,240
Uh, you know, over the two years, they say of various fun events

2007
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:52,320
disappeared from our daily lives, but games still lighten up our days.

2008
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:56,120
Games will continue to brighten up days of everybody now and forever

2009
01:54:56,120 --> 01:55:00,760
until they die from COVID, uh, theme implies such strong determination.

2010
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:04,920
Um, unprecedented excitement is always born out of something

2011
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:05,960
you have never imagined.

2012
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:11,280
This is a whole bunch of fluff and nothing stops game except for death.

2013
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:12,560
And then, uh, yeah.

2014
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:18,400
So I, they're going to be, I went to a big event in 2021.

2015
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:22,160
It had precautions and I think if they have, I mean, I don't

2016
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:23,400
know what the precautions are.

2017
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:27,160
So until I hear them, I can understand, but if they have precautions,

2018
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:29,320
I think it'll be all right.

2019
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:32,560
I don't, it's not going to, they don't outline any precautions so far.

2020
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,600
So, and everybody, everybody has to assess their own risk in that regard.

2021
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:36,200
Yeah.

2022
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:42,200
Um, but I'm not surprised that it's, I mean, it's going to eventually happen.

2023
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:46,440
Cause this is well, but also this, I mean, this is way out in what?

2024
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:49,560
October, November, October is just Tokyo game show, right?

2025
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:49,800
Yeah.

2026
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:50,960
It's September, October.

2027
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:55,760
I mean, they, they, we don't know if another variant will show up.

2028
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:57,760
I mean, let's fucking hope not.

2029
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:02,240
And a lot of scientists seem to think that if a variant shows up, it's going

2030
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:07,040
to trend the way Omicron did, where it's more transmissible, less dangerous.

2031
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:09,400
Um, hopefully fingers crossed.

2032
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:14,520
But again, we don't fucking know until it shows up because they say it might go

2033
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,320
that way, but it could go the other way.

2034
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:18,360
So we'll see.

2035
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:21,480
Um, so who knows what happens before September.

2036
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:25,120
And you know, as somebody who would like to get back to doing some of these

2037
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:28,320
events, again, I'm happy to wear a mask more than happy to get the shot, get

2038
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:31,280
vaccinated, love to see everyone around me and be that way as well.

2039
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,600
I'm happy to take precautions, precautions work.

2040
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:39,360
Um, I just, I, I, some of this coming back will be nice, but again, if

2041
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:42,640
another variant shows up, I expect it to all go away like that if it's

2042
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:45,000
worse, which would be a bummer.

2043
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:50,440
But yeah, it's sure with everything else going on in the world, the focus

2044
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,920
sure fell off COVID real quick, didn't it?

2045
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:55,320
It's just interesting.

2046
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:57,920
I mean, I get it, but it is interesting.

2047
01:56:59,000 --> 01:56:59,920
All right, moving on.

2048
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,120
Uh, I have one more story before we get to the listener round table.

2049
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:06,880
And that has to do with a very, and it's something Jason referenced in the intro

2050
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:10,880
about, uh, an interesting little story here with a missing game award for the

2051
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:17,240
game Celeste, of course, Celeste came out in 2018 and won two awards at the game

2052
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:20,520
awards games for impact and best independent game.

2053
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,760
Uh, and many people are still experiencing this game for the first

2054
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,120
time now that's what four years later, because, you know, Microsoft game pass,

2055
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:31,040
or just, you know, uh, it shows up a lot in these indie bundles and so forth.

2056
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:37,200
Um, apparently though the developer of the game, extremely okay games, never

2057
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:39,480
received one of the physical awards.

2058
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:40,360
It went missing.

2059
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:46,280
Um, apparently, uh, there was going scouring on the internet about trying

2060
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:50,480
to find a replica of the game board trophies, and there was a listing on

2061
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:53,160
eBay and it was a real award.

2062
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:57,120
So this streamer prestige is key.

2063
01:57:57,240 --> 01:58:01,920
Who's a YouTube streamer actually bid on the item and won it.

2064
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:09,240
And when they got it, they saw that, Oh, this is the missing Celeste 2018 award.

2065
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:13,000
And so he set it back basically.

2066
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:17,400
Um, when he asked the seller where it came from, they didn't really get an answer

2067
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:19,840
other than just liquidation sources.

2068
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,240
That almost sounds like a pawn shop or something like a pawn shop could

2069
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:26,040
sell it, so they put it on eBay.

2070
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:29,560
I don't know, but I'm making it up a little bit, but it definitely sounds like

2071
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:31,240
somebody else offloaded this somewhere.

2072
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:35,840
Um, so yeah, I thought that was, uh, I thought that was interesting.

2073
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:39,240
Uh, after figuring out that, or after prestige figured out that

2074
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:41,040
this was actually a real award.

2075
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:45,200
He got in touch with the studio and got it back with it, but got it back to them

2076
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:50,800
in exchange, extremely okay, sent some signed copies of Celeste and reimbursed

2077
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,760
for the auction and shipping costs.

2078
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:57,280
So that's very nice of them to reimburse after doing that nice gesture there.

2079
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,160
So it is a nice little feel good story to end on.

2080
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:02,160
Although of course it also begs the question.

2081
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:02,320
Yeah.

2082
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,560
Like tiger class doesn't chat.

2083
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:05,800
How the hell did it get lost in the first place?

2084
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:09,480
Well, you know, when you get an award at these types of things, like the

2085
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:14,280
Oscars, I think are like this, the Oscars may actually be different, but

2086
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:19,800
most award shows when you get a trophy, you're accepting a fake statue.

2087
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,600
It's a statue, but it's unengraved.

2088
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:28,120
So when you go backstage, You hand the statue back over to the handler who ends

2089
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:32,520
up reusing it with every person that cycles through the stage, because you get

2090
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:36,960
a real one in the mail or some other type of delivery method, you know, signed

2091
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:42,160
for FedEx, you get a real one that's engraved and has all your information

2092
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:47,480
on it that actually says best podcast, orange lounge radio engraved on it.

2093
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:53,320
Although actually, funny enough, the podcast awards back in 2006, when we

2094
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:58,080
won our podcast award, when grandma and grandpa won podcast awards, uh, it was

2095
01:59:58,080 --> 01:59:59,360
already engraved, wasn't it?

2096
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:01,160
Dark Sakura with our name.

2097
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:01,400
Yeah.

2098
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:01,960
Yeah.

2099
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
So sometimes they do it all in advance.

2100
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,400
It just depends on the award show, but the Oscars, I mean, the award we got

2101
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:12,080
was, was not expensive.

2102
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:12,400
Okay.

2103
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:16,160
But it was, Hey, we appreciate it all the same, but we know it was a low

2104
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:17,800
budget award and that's fine.

2105
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:22,680
Uh, but for the Oscars, which are like solid fucking gold, they

2106
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:23,560
send those out to be.

2107
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:28,320
So I think this is, I think this is similar to what the game award, uh,

2108
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:31,680
E3VL says, why don't they just give them the real one when they accept the award?

2109
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,800
Um, a variety of reasons.

2110
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:36,080
I think getting lost amongst the evening.

2111
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:42,280
Cause think about, think about the outfits that lady Gaga wears to the

2112
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:45,840
Oscars, where is she going to put a fucking statue?

2113
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:47,840
Well, she won't this year.

2114
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:48,640
Ouch.

2115
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:52,360
But when she wins best song, where does she put that

2116
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:54,280
fucking statue in her purse?

2117
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:56,240
Like where did she put it?

2118
02:00:56,240 --> 02:00:57,600
It's a placeholder statue.

2119
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:58,040
Yeah.

2120
02:00:58,040 --> 02:01:01,920
So there's, I think logistically, there's a lot of reasons they do it that way.

2121
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:07,600
And just, you know, but, but, um, I think that's also, they want to keep, keep it a

2122
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:08,080
secret.

2123
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:13,080
If they engrave all the awards, they know who the person who engraved it knows who

2124
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:17,320
won, somebody who transports it to the venue knows who won and they

2125
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:19,320
make a big deal at the Oscars.

2126
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:20,840
They always show at the Oscars.

2127
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:24,760
Here's the two people from prime and Westing, whatever that name of that

2128
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:28,920
company is that does all the tabulation, Westinghouse, here are the only two

2129
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:32,840
people in the world that know who won the Oscars because they did the tabulation.

2130
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,840
It's all part of that basically.

2131
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:39,600
So, uh, fifth dream says the real Oscars are DLC.

2132
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:42,400
You get them once the show is finished to avoid crunch.

2133
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:43,480
Sure.

2134
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:45,640
We're the friends we made along the way.

2135
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:49,960
We'll use that story here at orange launch radio.

2136
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:50,560
Yes, we will.

2137
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:51,720
All right.

02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:12,320
I know where there's at least one.

2145
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:13,920
It's a long one, but a good one.

2146
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:14,200
Yeah.

2147

Participate at orange launch radio.com.

2148
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:17,840
Hello, LR.

2149
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:19,480
Congrats on the new dig.

2150
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:23,240
Sorry, but I just had to write in following last week's episode, you

2151
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:26,840
mentioned Tempest 4,000 re-releasing on Switch in about two weeks, and I'm glad

2152
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:27,280
you did.

2153
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:32,640
It's the latest and quite possibly the last in Jeff Mintner's, uh, long running

2154
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:35,360
series of really cool and trippy Tempest remakes.

2155
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:39,480
The first of these was Tempest 2000 on Jaguar dating all the way back to 1994.

2156
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:39,760
Wow.

2157
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:41,040
That's over 25 years ago.

2158
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:44,800
Uh, Tempest, uh, I lost my place.

2159
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:49,560
Uh, Tempest 3000 was actually released on the short lived Nuon platform.

2160
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:50,560
That's right on Nuon.

2161
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:55,800
Nuon was technology that included Samsung and Toshiba DVD players that expanded the

2162
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:57,600
feature set, but also supported gaming.

2163
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:59,560
I did play on one of those, by the way.

2164
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:00,880
So I have played Tempest 3000.

2165
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:05,520
Do not forget Tempest 2000 also came out on Sega Saturn, which is copy I have.

2166
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:07,600
So back, back to the email.

2167
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:14,680
Um, let's see, uh, but in 2000 and 2001, only four movies and eight games were ever

2168
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:17,400
released for the platform and nothing else shipped after that.

2169
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:19,760
Tempest 3000 was never ported to another platform.

2170
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:25,760
And this concept was not seen again until 2014 when Llamasoft released TXK on

2171
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:28,960
PlayStation Vita, which I have on PlayStation TV, and it is lots of fun.

2172
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:33,240
Um, this is the game that would have released on the Switch, if not for the

2173
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:36,920
fact that Atari threatened legal action, barring Mintner from releasing the game

2174
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:41,480
on any other platforms, but to everyone's surprise, a remixed version of TXK

2175
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:44,720
resurfaced in 2018, as you guessed it, Tempest 4000.

2176
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:48,920
Llamasoft developed it and Atari released it to PS4 and Xbox.

2177
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:53,840
As someone who has played a bit of both games, I must admit, I prefer TXK.

2178
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:56,480
The difficulty ramps up more smoothly and the game is easier

2179
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:57,960
overall than Tempest 4000.

2180
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:01,760
So if you still have a Vita kicking around, I would highly recommend that

2181
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:03,840
you grab a TXK while you still can.

2182
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:07,400
The other tragedy is that TXK was supposed to have a VR mode when

2183
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:11,080
it was released on PS4, but Atari opted not to include it in Tempest 4000.

2184
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:14,200
So for your Llamasoft PSVR fix, you'll have to play

2185
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:15,960
Polybius or Moose Life instead.

2186
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:17,040
Yeah.

2187
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:21,680
And also it is, I believe still available for PSTV, just throwing that out there.

2188
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:27,120
Um, and then now that like YYR and by the hello, now that YYR spelled that out,

2189
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:30,960
I'm like, oh, I do remember talking about this on the show in stages

2190
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:33,480
because I remember that whole lawsuit thing that was going on.

2191
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:37,480
So thank you for like writing the book report summary, cliff note version of that.

2192
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:39,800
So thank you for, for like aligning us there.

2193
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:43,040
But do you remember when I had my footage of playing

2194
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,880
Tempest 3000 at Atari party?

2195
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:46,400
Oh yeah.

2196
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:47,560
I miss Atari party.

2197
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,920
I know that guy moved and obviously the, the, well,

2198
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:54,040
actually I think that Dan and one other person was left in

2199
02:04:54,040 --> 02:04:55,800
charge of the Atari party name.

2200
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:59,960
Oh, it's just a matter of getting everything arranged for it.

2201
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:01,560
I'm sure the pandemic didn't help.

2202
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:02,960
No, it did not.

2203
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:07,400
But, um, but I think Atari party could come back to saying,

2204
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:09,760
I'm just, I'm just going to throw it out there.

2205
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:11,800
I, and I, I haven't talked to Bobby about this.

2206
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,320
I'm going to put my foot in my mouth big time.

2207
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,880
Bog network presents Atari party.

2208
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:20,480
I would just saying I, we could talk and maybe make some things happen.

2209
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:20,920
We'll see.

2210
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:21,960
Let me tell it to Dan.

2211
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:22,400
Okay.

2212
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:23,680
Okay.

2213
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:25,440
You heard it here first.

2214
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:27,680
Maybe, maybe I might, I might.

2215
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:30,760
I might've just put myself in a lot of trouble, but we'll see.

2216
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:31,160
Cause I,

2217
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:32,840
let me finish the email cause it's long.

2218
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,760
Everybody's asking when's OLR Cod?

2219
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:35,560
When's OLR Cod?

2220
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:37,800
Well, maybe there's the email.

2221
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:38,200
Oh, shut up.

2222
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:38,520
Sorry.

2223
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:41,800
The classic game of the week was Metroid fusion.

2224
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:44,760
This game is meaningful to me in a number of, uh, in a

2225
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:46,160
different way than you would expect.

2226
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:48,480
Brace yourself for my unpopular opinion on this game.

2227
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:51,960
It was the greatest disappointment I'd ever experienced across 35 or so

2228
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:53,240
years I've been playing video games.

2229
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,840
Hear me out besides the great action and tight controls.

2230
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:59,480
The main reason I love the Metroid series is because it drops you into

2231
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:02,240
a strange and unfamiliar world than tasks you with exploring it.

2232
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:05,400
The quest of exploring the world, finding new abilities and figuring

2233
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:08,720
out how to harness those abilities to explore even more of the world.

2234
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:12,400
Led to some of my very favorite moments across the whole series, but Metroid

2235
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:13,720
fusion doesn't give you any of that.

2236
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:17,760
It moves in a linear fashion through one area of a space station, then to the

2237
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:22,360
next area, then to the next, after that, as a computer instructs you to go here,

2238
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:26,600
kill this, do that, the exploration is non-existent apart from finding a

2239
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:31,360
couple of small secret areas, and you don't even have to find the abilities

2240
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:33,480
as they're given to you automatically when you defeat bosses.

2241
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:37,160
Yeah, but the thing is that you're going to retrieve your stuff from these

2242
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:38,960
bosses, so that makes sense, but still.

2243
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:42,800
Uh, the high difficulty of the game comes exclusively from the fact

2244
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:47,080
that they do more damage to you, making the difficulty artificial.

2245
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:50,120
It's a decent action game, but in my humble opinion, it is

2246
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:51,280
not a Metroid game at all.

2247
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:52,800
Oh, everyone's wrong sometimes.

2248
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:58,200
I still never forget eagerly anticipating Metroid fusion and expecting

2249
02:06:58,200 --> 02:06:59,640
Metroid prime to be disappointing.

2250
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:01,560
But then the complete opposite happened.

2251
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:04,680
I found Metroid fusion to be an utter disappointment and prime blew me away.

2252
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:08,920
So I'll close asking what is that new ultra music last week?

2253
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:11,840
It sounded so familiar anyway, happy gaming and enjoy your week.

2254
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:13,960
Embracing the popular Aaron YYR.

2255
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:15,960
Um, I don't remember if I said it on air.

2256
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:17,120
I might've said it after the show.

2257
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:18,400
So let me acknowledge on air.

2258
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:21,880
Um, DJ Roma S made us a new credit sequence, um, to just kind of go with

2259
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,960
the recent makeover here at OLR with my move, um, and, uh, decided

2260
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:28,360
to change up the credit music, but I'm, I'm all right with it.

2261
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:31,440
You know, we've been using the Corona trigger song for a long time.

2262
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:33,640
So, uh, the new song is the ending.

2263
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:36,960
It's just, it's just that simple.

2264
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,400
It is the ending to Mario brothers three, but that's why it sounds familiar.

2265
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:41,800
I'm sure.

2266
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:43,240
So thank you so much.

2267
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:44,120
Why we are for the email.

2268
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:44,920
Really appreciate that.

2269
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:49,320
And, um, in defense of YYR is opinion, although certainly everybody's entitled

2270
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:52,520
to their opinion on games and there's always games that like people are going

2271
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:56,840
to love that some of us aren't going to get, and again, I said a RE I said a

2272
02:07:56,840 --> 02:08:02,000
recent example, uh, Elden ring, and I've even watched people play it and I'm not

2273
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,080
looking at Elden ring going, it's a bad game.

2274
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:05,160
It's not a bad game.

2275
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:07,160
It's just not zero interest in playing it.

2276
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:07,920
It's not for me.

2277
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:09,320
And that's okay.

2278
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:10,880
Not everything has to be about me.

2279
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:13,680
Contrary to what people say about me behind my back.

2280
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:15,640
Not everything has to be about me though.

2281
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:16,240
Just saying.

2282
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:24,080
So, um, you know, that's, uh, you know, not everything, but with the Metroid

2283
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:28,800
thing, I'm actually gonna somewhat, I don't always agree with YYR on how he

2284
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:33,720
feels about this game, but this most recent Metroid game, Metroid dread.

2285
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:37,880
Some of these issues you raise are some things that kind of

2286
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:39,280
bother me about Metroid dread.

2287
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:46,680
I don't love the chase and stealth stuff because the way I play Metroid

2288
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:52,200
historically has always been very slow and meticulous and exploring.

2289
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:57,200
So when Metroid thrust that on me, I wasn't like, it took

2290
02:08:57,200 --> 02:08:58,480
me a minute to get used to it.

2291
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:04,280
I appreciate Metroid dread now, but at, in that moment I was a little

2292
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:09,680
thrown and I'm not sure it is like, it's it, well, it's not, it's not

2293
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:11,840
as good as, um, super Metroid for me.

2294
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:15,800
So, you know, and, and, uh, some other Metroid games as well.

2295
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:22,400
So just, you know, I, I just kind of say, and for, uh, uh, YYR sake, I

2296
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:27,560
understand why a certain change to the formula throws you off because that's

2297
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:29,120
what I've been experiencing with Metroid dread.

2298
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:31,840
All right.

2299
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:34,760
Anyhow, um, thank you for the email.

2300
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:38,720
I don't see anyone in the green room, but I do see a question.

2301
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:42,040
Um, but dark soccer, you need to go AFK.

2302
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:43,800
Yeah, just for a second.

2303
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:44,480
Okay.

2304
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:45,280
All right, go ahead.

2305
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:45,760
What's the question?

2306
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:46,320
Quick question.

2307
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:46,600
Okay.

2308
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:50,240
This came in from Bobby Black Wolf who asks, when is your weird

2309
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:51,720
owl limited edition arriving?

2310
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:54,080
Are you in the October batch or the 2023 batch?

2311
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:55,720
Oh, good Lord.

2312
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:58,400
Um, I think we're in the 2023 batch.

2313
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:00,720
I'll have to ask Dan real quick.

2314
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:03,240
Um, but I think we made it into the sec.

2315
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:04,080
I don't know though.

2316
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:09,560
Like they, like we got our pre-order and then they like didn't record it, but Dan

2317
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:14,680
called the company and they got our pre-order in, so I think we're in the

2318
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:19,440
later batch, which makes me sad inside of my heart region, but good things

2319
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:20,400
come to those who wait, right?

2320
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:22,960
No, it needs to happen now.

2321
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:23,720
All right.

2322
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:27,480
And yes, dark soccer did order that weird out table that she talked about last week

2323
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:29,120
on the show as we all knew she would.

2324
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:32,480
So it's been 13 grand, been very pinball heavy here at VOG network.

2325
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:35,440
Cause if you listen to Bobby Black Wolf, which I encourage you all to do, he

2326
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:39,440
talked to last week about his new rush table, uh, that he got and putting that

2327
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:40,000
together.

2328
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,480
So I'm looking forward to playing that Labor Day weekend when I go out to

2329
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:48,320
Atlanta, uh, assuming, but, um, uh, doesn't fuck up, fuck us all up.

2330
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:49,040
What's that?

2331
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:53,280
You have three weeks left to play Elvira over at my place.

2332
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:55,040
Oh no, it's leaving.

2333
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:56,960
Yeah, we're giving it back.

2334
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:00,160
Um, so if you want to come play Elvira, come play it.

2335
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:03,840
We're so we're, we, I think we have, uh, we're selling Mandalorian.

2336
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:05,840
Uh huh.

2337
02:11:06,240 --> 02:11:12,480
And, um, I think what's the, uh, I think we're selling my shows in three

2338
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:16,320
weeks, but I'll, I'll try to make it work because I still, I still have, um, the

2339
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:19,280
stuff that Loki gave me to give to you, like sitting in a box.

2340
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:21,280
Cause we had to move it to this house.

2341
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:26,480
So I think we're, I think we're selling, um, Oh gosh, not ACD stuff.

2342
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:31,840
Um, one of those other like heavy metal band ones, mega death or whatever.

2343
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:32,640
Not mega death.

2344
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,000
I can't think of it off the top of my head.

2345
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,080
Like I can see the logo and not Slayer.

2346
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:40,240
I know they didn't do a Slayer one, but it was like in that.

2347
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:44,240
No, I'll have to look, but we're selling one.

2348
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:47,040
Um, I remember the machine, not Metallica.

2349
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:49,040
It's another not Metallica.

2350
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:52,720
Yeah, we don't, I don't think we have Metallica anymore, but, uh, we're

2351
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:54,400
definitely holding on to Ghostbusters.

2352
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:55,600
So that's good.

2353
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:56,240
Iron maiden.

2354
02:11:56,960 --> 02:11:57,440
Iron maiden.

2355
02:11:57,440 --> 02:11:58,720
That's the one we're selling iron maiden.

2356
02:11:59,520 --> 02:11:59,760
Yep.

2357
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:01,200
All right.

2358
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:04,640
Uh, comments and chat pod culture says voice of pinball network.

2359
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:05,040
Yes.

2360
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:11,440
Sometimes, Hey, we, you all have pointed out my office has a nice space next to,

2361
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:14,320
um, you know, burger time there that something could go.

2362
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:18,240
I think we can lend you a table if you want.

2363
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:23,120
No getting a table upstairs would be the biggest pain in the.

2364
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:23,840
Oh yes.

2365
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:24,800
I know this very well.

2366
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:29,440
I, I, I do think that one of two things is going to happen.

2367
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:33,120
The Tron machine is going to, I'm going to get that or the, um, Namco

2368
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:35,280
celebration one, cause I want a super pack manager.

2369
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:38,960
Um, but they, I think these will actually, oops, sorry.

2370
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:42,480
I think these will actually move into the walk-in closet and I'll

2371
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:44,240
have a walk-in arcade essentially.

2372
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:48,400
So, well, you could still, I mean, you've got a garage.

2373
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:51,920
We have to park cars in it.

2374
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:53,600
Part of our HOA.

2375
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:54,080
Yeah.

2376
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:56,080
So screw HOA.

2377
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:59,120
I know, but it would make sense.

2378
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:00,720
I explained to you off air.

2379
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:01,840
You kind of have to have one.

2380
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:06,400
Well, I'm, I'm sure it goes with any new community.

2381
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:07,040
Yeah, it does.

2382
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:08,880
All right.

2383
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:14,720
Um, as 200 Matt says, pin cast channel reward episode win.

2384
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:16,080
Actually you bring up a great point.

2385
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:21,360
We have owed this community for three or four months, orange lounge foodie-o.

2386
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:23,920
So the three of us, the three of us need to get our heads together.

2387
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:27,200
And I think you all understand why, and thank you for being gracious and

2388
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:31,200
understanding why, um, mentally I was not in a place where I could do it.

2389
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:32,160
Right.

2390
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,840
Well, you know, it was just badly timed.

2391
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:36,960
Um, I'm in a much better place now with all that.

2392
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:40,160
So I'm, I'm happy to do the foodie-o episode and I don't even, I don't

2393
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:41,200
need a guest host or anything.

2394
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:42,240
I mean, I'll do it.

2395
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:42,880
It's cool.

2396
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:43,840
I'll do it.

2397
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:44,080
Shit.

2398
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:44,480
Yeah.

2399
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:46,000
So we just need to set a date.

2400
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:50,880
So, um, and then once we get that out of the way, well, I say it like it's a,

2401
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:55,840
once we finally deliver on that promise because things got held up much better

2402
02:13:55,840 --> 02:14:00,160
way of phrasing it, then we can open up the rewards again to these other fun

2403
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:01,120
ideas you guys have.

2404
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:03,680
Um, and I, I know we want to do that.

2405
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:05,360
We're kind of, kind of backlogged on that right now.

2406
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:09,680
So, uh, I will talk to my co-host off air to try to set a date for, um, orange

2407
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:10,960
lounge foodie-o.

2408
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:17,760
Speaking of dates, um, by the way, I will not be here on the, uh, on April

2409
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:23,440
17th for, I will be, uh, actually probably in LA at that point.

2410
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:25,200
Um, eating at Roscoe's.

2411
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:27,920
I'm going to Disneyland for my birthday.

2412
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:28,720
I love that.

2413
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:29,280
Love that for you.

2414
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:29,920
You can't stop me.

2415
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:31,360
Are you going to see?

2416
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:34,480
And this is a big step for me because I haven't wanted to be around like people

2417
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:35,440
in groups at all.

2418
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:38,400
Um, and hopefully Tiara will be able to meet me.

2419
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:39,760
I have invited them.

2420
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:41,600
I haven't seen them in forever.

2421
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:42,000
That's right.

2422
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,120
They live in Vegas now, right?

2423
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:44,800
You want to come for my birthday?

2424
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:52,240
I wish, but you can still talk to so-and-so.

2425
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:53,520
I'm going to table that question.

2426
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:55,920
I'm not going to say no, I'm going to table it.

2427
02:14:57,120 --> 02:15:00,160
Outlook unlikely, but I kind of want to try.

2428
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:01,700
Okay.

2429
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:02,800
All right.

2430
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,280
It certainly would make affording a hotel easier.

2431
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:06,960
That's yeah.

2432
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:10,080
But I tried to get Blue Bayou and they're booked.

2433
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:12,160
They're like nothing good.

2434
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:15,840
And I'm going to be doing just Disneyland in the afternoon.

2435
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:16,720
Do lunch at Carthay.

2436
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:18,640
I can't.

2437
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:21,040
Um, well, no, actually I could do lunch.

2438
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:22,000
No, Carthay was booked.

2439
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:25,280
There were only like a handful of places that had any openings.

2440
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:28,560
So it'd have to like be put on a list to go eat there.

2441
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:33,200
Have you talked to our gal pal Victoria about Aria snark?

2442
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:33,600
I haven't yet.

2443
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:35,360
I haven't talked to Victoria in months.

2444
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,040
Oh, okay.

2445
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:38,560
Would you talk to Victoria?

2446
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:41,680
Well, I mean, she's just an expert.

2447
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:45,120
Yeah, no, um, I'm going through the Disney dining booking online.

2448
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:49,440
Uh, I don't think there's any secret tricks or anything with that.

2449
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:50,960
I think there's, yeah, no, there's not.

2450
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:54,240
I mean, there's also calling and saying it's my birthday.

2451
02:15:54,240 --> 02:15:55,760
I want to eat there, do it.

2452
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:56,800
And then crying.

2453
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:57,520
And that might happen.

2454
02:15:58,080 --> 02:16:02,080
Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I'm trying to figure out how I would get enough equipment

2455
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:04,800
into my arcade to be able to stream from there.

2456
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:08,160
I'd have to almost dismantle my existing setup completely.

2457
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:09,120
Well, here's okay.

2458
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:15,040
So Bobby, actually, if you really wanted to do that, I have a studio that's meant to be

2459
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:15,520
portable.

2460
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:17,760
That's now in a box.

2461
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:18,480
It's not.

2462
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:23,600
So, so the Mac mini that used to broadcast this show, it's not in the loop anymore because

2463
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:27,360
it didn't make sense for this virtual environment for me to just pass it to another computer.

2464
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:32,880
But I still have it because there's going to come a day where once again, OLR will broadcast

2465
02:16:32,880 --> 02:16:35,680
from an expo somewhere and we can do it.

2466
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:38,080
So I, Oh, it's the lights and the mics.

2467
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:38,720
I see.

2468
02:16:38,720 --> 02:16:40,400
Oh, I have some of that.

2469
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:42,080
I have the mixing board and all that, but you're right.

2470
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:44,560
That would get, would get a little crunchy on the space.

2471
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:49,920
But if, if we could do, okay, so you have to think back to when there was a Sacramento

2472
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:52,400
IGDA, which there is, that doesn't even exist anymore.

2473
02:16:52,400 --> 02:16:54,160
It's Sacramento gamers collective now.

2474
02:16:54,160 --> 02:17:00,720
But when we did the IGDA expo, you remember those shows is about 2014, 2015, somewhere

2475
02:17:00,720 --> 02:17:00,960
in there.

2476
02:17:01,680 --> 02:17:07,200
Um, we did, uh, that show at the, what the fuck was it called?

2477
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:10,640
The colony right next to the colonial theater where I do all these other shows.

2478
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:11,440
Yeah.

2479
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:12,240
I remember that.

2480
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:17,200
If we could broadcast a show from there, we could broadcast a show from your, your basement.

2481
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:22,400
That place was not a nice, Hey, I'm glad they had it.

2482
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:23,840
I'm glad they got to do a thing, but you're right.

2483
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:27,120
It was a very itty bitty space, but that's why the next, the next year they did it at

2484
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:30,640
the West Sacramento convention space, which was much better, much better space.

2485
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:34,480
Uh, GTRama S says, where did I get that gaming chair?

2486
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:35,360
It looks nice.

2487
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:35,760
Thank you.

2488
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:36,960
I think it's just Amazon.

2489
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:44,080
Um, and I say, I think because it was Alan's gaming chair and then he had the same brand.

2490
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:44,800
He bought me.

2491
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:46,720
No, we did.

2492
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:47,280
Okay.

2493
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:50,400
Um, I got this one on, um, Nick's recommendation.

2494
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:56,560
He bought me a green chair for my birthday Christmas.

2495
02:17:56,560 --> 02:18:01,840
No, he bought me a green chair for Christmas, but the problem was green screening with it.

2496
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:04,000
No, it wasn't the green screen that I could deal with.

2497
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:10,160
The bottom was shaped like this, but literally my butt was too big for the chair because

2498
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:15,200
when I would sit in the chair, the sides would like dig into my fat fucking ass.

2499
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:18,000
So I couldn't like sit comfortably in that chair.

2500
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:23,040
The ironic thing is I've now lost almost 40 pounds since then.

2501
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:27,440
And so it probably wouldn't be a problem anymore, but Alan and I have already switched chairs.

2502
02:18:27,440 --> 02:18:28,560
So I can't.

2503
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:30,960
Yeah, it is what it is.

2504
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:36,080
Um, as the show 100 Matt is suggesting for dark soccer, there's a third party Disney

2505
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:40,560
dining app that gets all the appointment booking data and pings you and slots open up for times.

2506
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:41,860
Hmm.

2507
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:49,120
I, oh, I know mouse weight had something kind of like that, but

2508
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:54,960
I'm just, I'm just, you know, I'm happy that, that I'm going to be able to go.

2509
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:59,200
But yeah, it's been, it's been a while cause of the pan panini.

2510
02:18:59,200 --> 02:18:59,760
Yeah.

2511
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:06,400
I went, I went, um, Memorial day, the day after Memorial day in 2019, right after drag con.

2512
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:09,040
Well, you know, I'm never going to again.

2513
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:14,640
I heard, yeah, we went between Delta and Omicron.

2514
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:16,880
So when it was like, oh, things are getting better.

2515
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:17,600
And then it was site.

2516
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:19,920
Well, we went right in between those and we had a good time.

2517
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:22,800
Do you have to get tickets for galaxy's edge anymore?

2518
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:26,240
I believe yes for that one.

2519
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:26,480
Yes.

2520
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:29,040
But not the Spiderman ride.

2521
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:29,680
Fucking Nathan.

2522
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:30,640
I have to worry about that too.

2523
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:31,360
Don't quote me on that.

2524
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:32,720
Well, you can't get them until the day off.

2525
02:19:32,720 --> 02:19:34,480
You just have to wake up early and do it.

2526
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:36,080
That part Victoria is good at.

2527
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:39,620
All right.

2528
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:44,160
I'm going to have to double check the stuff behind that, but at any rate, yeah.

2529
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:45,360
All right.

2530
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:49,680
I think with all that we are, uh, to the end of our show for tonight.

2531
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:51,200
Thank you all so much for listening.

2532
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:51,680
Of course.

2533
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:56,240
Uh, hopefully the sounds getting better as we get used to this new and improved setup

2534
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:57,120
and there's more to come.

2535
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:58,960
I still have so much I want to build in this room.

2536
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:00,880
It's just going to expand.

2537
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:05,040
I want to thank everybody for tuning in tonight, whether you were here live with us on Twitch

2538
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:07,120
or you were tuned into the podcast feed.

2539
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:09,280
Thank you for being a part of orange launch radio this week.

2540
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:13,760
I hope you all have a great week ahead, uh, with whatever you're doing this week, whether

2541
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:15,760
it be gaming, uh, getting ready for St.

2542
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:19,440
Patrick's day, which I guess is in two weeks, uh, or whatever, whatever it is you're doing.

2543
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:21,040
I hope you all are having a wonderful week.

2544
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:23,760
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, tell a friend or two

2545
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:24,560
about the show.

2546
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:27,760
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

2547
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:28,800
need more voices here.

2548
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:31,360
Participating with our show, a nice five star review.

2549
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:35,360
Wherever you found this show, iTunes, Spotify, Google podcasts, wherever it is, you found

2550
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:35,920
the show.

2551
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:39,200
A nice five star review goes an awful long way as well.

2552
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:44,640
Um, don't forget to join our discord vog at network.com slash discord and continue the

2553
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:49,120
conversation throughout the week with our friends and our podcast family and everybody

2554
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:52,880
there, um, participating along with that.

2555
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:53,840
We will wrap it up.

2556
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:58,240
I believe dark soccer as usual is, uh, going to her post-show killing spree.

2557
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:00,640
Uh, so I will let you go first with your final thought.

2558
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:05,360
Um, um, words, things.

2559
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:06,800
Yeah.

2560
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:09,040
All right.

2561
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:10,640
And on that note, have a great stream.

2562
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:13,760
All right.

2563
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:15,680
And, uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2564
02:21:16,480 --> 02:21:20,640
I get my new computer tomorrow or hopefully it's been fixed.

2565
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:21,760
Well, it was fixed.

2566
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:29,840
Um, ended up being some cables disconnected and apparently hooked up incorrectly somehow.

2567
02:21:30,640 --> 02:21:33,280
So the repair shop was able to take care of it though.

2568
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:38,240
Um, Alan and I are getting some money back from the house on something we overpaid on.

2569
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:40,880
So we're looking at maybe money in our computer.

2570
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:42,640
So that'll be very nice.

2571
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:44,480
I'm ready for an upgrade though.

2572
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:46,720
And now those things will directly benefit OLR as well.

2573
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:48,740
All right.

2574
02:21:49,300 --> 02:21:51,700
Um, that is it.

2575
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:52,580
My final thought.

2576
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:57,460
I don't have a lot, just, you know, the, the work is never done here with unpacking.

2577
02:21:57,460 --> 02:21:59,940
Um, but also just a lot more exciting stuff to come.

2578
02:21:59,940 --> 02:22:03,540
I'm really hoping maybe in the next week, Alan and I can stream together because that's

2579
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:06,820
something we've been promising for a while is the two of us streaming at the same time.

2580
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:10,180
Now that we're no longer in the same room and we have the bandwidth for it, it's possible.

2581
02:22:10,180 --> 02:22:10,900
So that's exciting.

2582
02:22:11,540 --> 02:22:12,340
