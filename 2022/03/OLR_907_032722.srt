1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Hot Take Warning!

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,960
Gran Turismo has always been the most stunning, technical, beautiful simulation racing game

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
on the market.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,760
It pushes the boundaries in a very specific way that other games comfortably nestle inside

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,380
as they create their own vision.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,860
The increase in graphical fidelity hit a near-kappa generation ago.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,880
Every improvement now is miniscule or an ancillary detail like crowds, environment, etc.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,040
Meanwhile, Pokemon Arceus and Kirby have a choppy distance renderer.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,600
Give me more Nintendo, please.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,800
This is my opinion and you should have your own, but now it's time for your hosts, Rob

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,360
Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about the actual Gran Turismo story and the

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,360
rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every gamer has

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,640
a voice.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,760
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,440
where every gamer has a voice.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:06,680
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 907 of our

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,720
show once again, I'll get into that in a minute, for this, tonight, March the 27th of 2022.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,680
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined, as usual, every Sunday night, whether there's

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,240
a silly award show going on or not, with my co-hosts.

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,080
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Hi.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,520
How are you, Jamie Summers?

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
I am.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Yes.

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,040
Uh, folks, uh, may notice that are watching live.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,280
The cam is broken tonight, unfortunately, so we don't see you, um, but we hear you discord

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,800
just doesn't like to use it.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Discord is broken.

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,120
And we learned that last week, but I'll get into that in a moment.

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,280
Um, also joining us tech master, Loki.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
Hello.

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Hi, Loki.

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
How are you doing?

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Good.

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,040
So I noticed the game playing behind you tonight is that new tiny Tina Wonderland game, right?

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
It is.

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Yes.

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Yeah.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
Uh, so have you been able to check that out yet?

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,560
No, I have not, uh, uh, I want to check it out even, which is funny because I'm not like

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,240
super into Borderlands, but like the little bit that I've played at those games, I do

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,380
enjoy them.

43
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,680
And then I kind of like love the idea of the more like fantasy realm setting with that.

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,120
So, um, it's a little bit more fancy, but it's, it seems pretty similar to Borderlands

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,000
three, but yeah, it's certainly more fantasy, but not completely just fantasy.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Gotcha.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All right.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,520
Uh, anyway, uh, let's get into the show.

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
We'll get into our kickoff topic.

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Okay.

51
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,320
So first let me talk about this because the podcast listeners noticed there was no podcast

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,200
last week, even though we did have sort of a live show.

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,460
So what happened?

54
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,800
We didn't have a full live show.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,360
We had about maybe 20 minutes of a live show.

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,600
Uh, we had so many problems with discord last week and I don't know what it was.

57
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,400
Uh, I was not able to see Loki.

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
I wasn't able to hear him.

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,240
I couldn't hear dark Sakura, even though I knew that the cam issues were going on.

60
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,560
I don't know what was happening, but it was a mess.

61
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,260
It took us 15 minutes to get started with an actual show.

62
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,560
And those of you that were here live saw the whole thing.

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,580
It took us 15 minutes to get started live with an actual show.

64
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,360
Then when the show started, I think we got maybe 20 minutes into it.

65
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,000
And then more tech problems started happening where my co-host couldn't even hear me.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,700
And so I threw up my hands and I said, you know what?

67
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700
I can't deal with this.

68
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,700
We're done.

69
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,080
So I said, shut it down.

70
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,080
So we did, and that was it for the night.

71
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
And I was like, you know what?

72
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,680
The 20 minutes that we recorded really wasn't enough for a podcast and it's kind of funky.

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,560
So I'm just, I'm going to let it just be like a live only thing.

74
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,600
And that's that.

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,320
So if you're on the pipe and you're wondering what happened to the show, that's what happened

76
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
to the show.

77
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
We didn't have much of one.

78
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,880
We only got through our kickoff topic.

79
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,000
We had barely gotten into our gaming weeks and then we couldn't even hear each other

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
anymore.

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,880
So that was pretty much what you missed.

82
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,040
So we are redoing episode number 907 tonight.

83
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,680
So that's why I said welcome to 907 again, because technically this is take two on episode

84
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,300
907, but with all new stories from this week.

85
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,760
So there you go.

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,880
And hello in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where we do tape live every Sunday

87
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,840
night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

88
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
show.

89
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:24,620
And looking in chat, I see a question coming in about why do you have to reload when the

90
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,660
shows change?

91
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,140
You don't always, so like when you're watching live, Bobby basically stops broadcasting from

92
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,080
his Atlanta home office.

93
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,940
And then I pick up the feed in my Sacramento home office because I have to change the title

94
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,360
and all that stuff too, so that they save as two separate recordings.

95
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,140
There really isn't a way for us to do that.

96
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,420
We would have to literally remote into a central computer and it's just too much.

97
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,620
However, most systems, as far as I know, pick up the new feed automatically.

98
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,220
You don't usually have to stop all together, so I'm not sure why that is.

99
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,860
I don't know if that's just a browser thing or whatever it is.

100
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
I'm not sure.

101
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,660
But just to answer that question, for the folks who are listening live, and I do see

102
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,060
in chat that a hype train just started, y'all are so kind, thank you so much for that.

103
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:21,140
You don't have to do that, especially after last week, but thank you very much for that.

104
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,060
Let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight.

105
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,540
Let's get into some gaming news.

106
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,260
Maybe we could actually have some gaming discussions tonight.

107
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
Let's do it.

108
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,260
Loki, why don't you start us off?

109
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,300
I mean, I guess we can.

110
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,660
Or I could sit here and fight with Discord all night.

111
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
You know what?

112
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,760
I think it was, and it's, oh yeah, of course, this goes without saying.

113
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,520
So we decide, okay, we're going to meet 30 minutes early tonight, I'll miss Bobby's show,

114
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,840
we need to meet early, try to make sure everything works before we go live, look at the solutions

115
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,160
if we have to go that way.

116
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,320
And of course, we all get on Discord and what happens?

117
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,160
Everything just works.

118
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,300
Like it always has.

119
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,080
Every other week we've done this.

120
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,720
So what the fuck happened last week?

121
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,480
I don't know.

122
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,960
And my thought is, is it because Discord was getting DDoSed?

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,580
Was it the server?

124
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,660
Everything in gaming has been getting DDoSed lately.

125
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,980
I know we have a story on it later, but I know Sony got, Microsoft within the last two

126
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,100
weeks was like, everybody's getting DDoSed.

127
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,920
Was Discord getting something?

128
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,220
Was that why we couldn't see each other?

129
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,220
I don't know.

130
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,220
It's a mess.

131
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Anyway.

132
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,220
So I throw it out there.

133
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,860
Okay, Loki, you can talk games now.

134
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,880
So we've been for the longest time hearing rumors and just speculating that, hey, Sony

135
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,600
needs something to kind of compete with Game Pass that Microsoft has.

136
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,780
And I guess that's supposed to be coming very soon.

137
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,740
So they're saying that it could be revealed next week.

138
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,860
The service has a code name, which I'm not going to say because it's stupid.

139
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,880
And we don't need the spread, Spartacus.

140
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
It's code name.

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
I am Spartacus.

142
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,760
It is not exciting enough to have a code name of Spartacus.

143
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,880
It should be like, I don't know, code name Sion or something.

144
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,200
Code name Sony Game Pass.

145
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,760
I guess Sony late to the party got to copy what Game Pass does.

146
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,600
Sony flicks.

147
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
I don't know.

148
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,360
So anyways, so yeah, they're going to put out some sort of service.

149
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,480
There's something maybe streaming is going to be involved with it.

150
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,320
It's a lot of speculation until the actual announcement comes out.

151
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,880
So cool.

152
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,920
It'll be coming at some point probably next week.

153
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,200
I think what makes this interesting and why I know a lot of people are always iffy when

154
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,480
it comes to reporting on rumors, but I think it's important to point out it's a lot of

155
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,440
the investor websites that are running with this news.

156
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,040
And that's why it's a little more like this isn't just like somebody's Twitter account.

157
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,320
Like my uncle works at Sony.

158
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,120
This is investor insider stuff.

159
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,920
And one of the things that they did mention, though, out of the report is that the new

160
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:15,120
service is not expected to have their big titles day one, unlike, you know, Game Pass,

161
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
which does.

162
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Yeah.

163
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
So.

164
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,800
So basically, like, like one of the biggest sales angles of Game Pass, we already know

165
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,640
Sony is not going to run with and that's the day one releases.

166
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,660
It sounds I don't know if that's true.

167
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:36,140
It sounds like Sony may rely on its back catalog a little more to bolster it all.

168
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,140
And we'll see.

169
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
We'll see.

170
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,140
I don't know.

171
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,140
They could.

172
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Yeah.

173
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
Cool, but.

174
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,900
You know, it seems like they're just putting a fresh coat of paint on PlayStation now.

175
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,820
Well, PlayStation now sucks.

176
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,820
Yeah.

177
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,100
I mean, they needed to rebrand it, so I don't blame them necessarily for doing that.

178
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,420
And they're saying that they're going to have different tiers, too.

179
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,300
So they're like different tiers would include video games, streaming demos, back catalog

180
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
games.

181
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
So it sounds confusing.

182
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,820
Like, honestly, like it's they're taking it and making it worse and more confusing.

183
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,180
It sounds like because we're in multiple tiers, we're not going to have the day one games.

184
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,460
It's like, OK, well, why bother?

185
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,380
Like why even bother at that point?

186
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,060
Well, I could see something interesting happening here, and that would be if Sony is going to

187
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,860
leverage their back catalog.

188
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,900
And this is I'm going to fully admit this is wishful thinking.

189
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:40,420
OK, Sony does have the advantage over Microsoft that they have a richer back catalog going

190
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,020
all the way back to the PlayStation one days.

191
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:50,260
A lot of people back in the day said they wanted Nintendo to go the Netflix route.

192
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,360
With their online stuff, Nintendo kind of did that, but still gets dragged over the

193
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,480
coals for it because they don't exactly have enough.

194
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
That's there.

195
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,940
No, you know, and here I thought that they were copying Microsoft.

196
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,240
They're copying Nintendo again.

197
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,400
Well, no, I don't know if it's a Nintendo, but absolutely they're copying Nintendo game

198
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,720
because what they're going to do is they're going to have libraries, a PlayStation, PlayStation

199
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,080
two, PlayStation three that they're going to slowly trickle in stuff.

200
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,680
But there'll be some games that will be locked up at the PlayStation plus plus whatever,

201
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,120
you know, you have to pay for in order to get the the extra content in there.

202
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,740
They're copying Nintendo.

203
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,680
It's a Sony move.

204
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,900
But here's here's the point I was trying to arrive at.

205
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,840
What if Sony does it better and actually provides that full rich library out the gate?

206
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,000
You're already disagreeing.

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No, no, they won't do better.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,400
Because and is it because well, and the thing that I think is holding Nintendo back is that

209
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,760
Nintendo is pretty much put every first party game they can out on the service, at least

210
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,320
as far as the NES and the SNES goes, like every first party game.

211
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,600
I mean, I'm sure you all can think of an exception or two here or there, like maybe like, I would

212
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,560
say one that sticks out for me is Illusion of Gaia, which I know they published in the

213
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,520
US because they had the strategy guide in that that isn't on the Super Nintendo service

214
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,600
and it ought to be.

215
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,080
So there are exceptions.

216
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,440
But I feel like a lot of third party stuff is what you know, and getting those agreements

217
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,200
can be tough.

218
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,160
I think that they're gonna see because I don't trust Sony to do the right thing here.

219
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,560
The reason why is because we look at what they do as far as like their practices.

220
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:42,320
So most a lot of games, no free upgrades, you have to pay additional money to upgrade

221
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
it from like PlayStation four to PlayStation five type of thing.

222
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,940
Their games cost more.

223
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:54,840
They're charging $69.99 for their games, whereas Microsoft's charging 60.

224
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:02,040
They I mean, have been very hesitant in the past to support backwards compatibility.

225
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,760
They well, they did.

226
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,440
They supported it, but you got to buy them again.

227
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Cool.

228
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:17,040
They also have been stripping away the the free games that they offered in their PlayStation

229
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Plus.

230
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,720
Remember, PlayStation Plus used to have like PlayStation three games, PSP games and all

231
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,140
that kind of stuff.

232
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,960
And yeah, they they stopped supporting those systems.

233
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:33,600
But you can't tell me that a PlayStation four or five can't run a PSP game or handle PlayStation

234
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,640
three game.

235
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,080
I mean.

236
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,080
It's just maybe, maybe not PlayStation for PlayStation five can handle PlayStation three

237
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
game.

238
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,780
And even then, yes, five has PS five has PS four backward compatibility built in.

239
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,020
So it can it can play everything.

240
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,040
I mean, yeah, like emulators.

241
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,520
I know people go emotion engine like come on emulators are at the point where it can

242
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
it can work.

243
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,080
The only emotion engine that I'm feeling is the disappointment engine, because that's

244
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,560
that's what I get with Sony is disappointment when it comes to supporting their fans.

245
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,120
Do they make great first party games?

246
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Sure.

247
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,280
They make great first party games.

248
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:16,040
But you know, once again, that only goes so far, you know, to bolster a console, you really

249
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,360
only looking at a handful of games that define this console versus some other console.

250
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,160
So they really need to make this service attractive.

251
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,440
Because otherwise, people aren't just going to give them the time of day.

252
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,820
Not that they can't anyways, because you can't get a PlayStation five.

253
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,580
But you know, it's just if they were going to like, say, Oh, we'll get a PlayStation

254
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,600
four, and you can stream all this stuff or get these PlayStation five games somehow compatible

255
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
with it.

256
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
I don't know.

257
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,500
But like, it's just, I don't expect much from them.

258
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,480
So hopefully, they surprise me.

259
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,860
They have you know, what they really should be doing is like, I understand that they're

260
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,900
separate companies.

261
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,100
Because the entertainment company is different from the movie company, but you are a movie

262
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
studio.

263
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,880
You spice up some of that with the movies?

264
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Why not?

265
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
I mean, like that?

266
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,200
Yeah, I remember talking about that a while ago is that Sony does have something that

267
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,300
Microsoft doesn't have in that department.

268
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,140
And that Sony could leverage their catalog of movies.

269
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,420
Now and that I that would really change the conversation.

270
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:24,620
I think if now it's PlayStation now is these games and you can stream I don't know Spider

271
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,300
Man or is that now a Disney thing?

272
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,300
I don't even know anymore.

273
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
That's a Disney thing.

274
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Okay.

275
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,300
Well, fucking it.

276
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Well, it's kind of in the weird.

277
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
You can stream.

278
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Morbius.

279
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Okay.

280
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,460
The Uncharted movie, for God's sake, obvious that you could stream the Uncharted movie

281
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,340
and other things like within Sony's warehouse, you know, or and music.

282
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,700
What if it was all of that?

283
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,620
I think that would be the game changer.

284
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,540
And that's where Sony has something that the other other kids in playground don't have.

285
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,060
So it would be interesting to see if they were to actually leverage that.

286
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,300
So let's see.

287
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,620
Mike Deaf says Spider Man is Sony, not Disney.

288
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,020
I know the rights are complicated there, but didn't ultimately that movie is streaming

289
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,900
on Disney Plus, ultimately, isn't it?

290
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,020
The far from home, whatever.

291
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,940
I think that's where it's going.

292
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Yeah.

293
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,100
So I don't know how they worked all that out.

294
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,980
But streaming rights were probably a part of that.

295
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,540
Oh, Bobby says, no, that's not how it worked.

296
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,360
It's going to stars first stars with stars.

297
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,480
There's too damn many streaming services.

298
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,200
No one's going to stream it from the stars.

299
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
I want to get to another question here.

300
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,440
But first, let me say, I usually don't stop to acknowledge this, but I have to.

301
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,780
Somebody anonymously cheered 1000 biddies.

302
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,260
That is no small amount.

303
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,060
So whoever you are, thank you very much.

304
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,060
Thank you.

305
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,860
Also no small amount, Bobby Blackwolf and Obi Wan Jabroni, five gift subs each.

306
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,360
So thank you all.

307
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,480
And there's I didn't even read all the other ones that were smaller cheers.

308
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
Thank you.

309
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Thank you.

310
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
I see you.

311
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
I noticed you.

312
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
And I'll read them all at the end of the show.

313
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Thank you so much for that.

314
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
You don't have to.

315
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,920
It's appreciated.

316
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,600
With one of those cheers, actually, she helped 10 cheered 100 biddies and said the future

317
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,480
is streaming games via Netflix style subscription.

318
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,420
I kind of think I kind of think, yes, she's right.

319
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,980
I mean, I feel like I've echoed some of this before, because where the movie industry goes,

320
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,460
the game industry inevitably goes and this is absolutely where the movie industry is

321
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,460
going.

322
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,900
And I agree that's going to happen, just not with bandwidth caps.

323
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,220
Yeah, no, I agree.

324
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,500
The bandwidth cap issue has to give and, you know, obviously it's Comcast.

325
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,060
It's well, and I guess there's other smaller.

326
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:47,020
But if we could get more competition in that Internet space, but you're starting to see

327
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
it.

328
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,000
You know what I saw commercial for the other day, because somebody I know from the Twitch

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,540
thing and on Twitter is a frickin spokesperson for this now, Verizon has these 5G boxes that

330
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,460
you can get to get 5G on the go.

331
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,300
Well, because it's not everywhere yet, but it's they're working on it.

332
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:14,060
So Comcast Xfinity and all the other providers with data caps are going to have to worry

333
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,960
about this competition coming soon.

334
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,220
And again, not to toot my own horn, but I'm going to a little bit.

335
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,940
I said this like a year ago, probably two years ago.

336
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:29,580
There's going to come a time where 5G is in 90 plus percent of the country and cable is

337
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,500
going to have to compete with that super fast over the air connection.

338
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,480
And if mobile continues to offer unlimited plans because data caps are a myth anyway,

339
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,740
that's where cable is going to get its competition.

340
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,820
And I think once all that gets sorted out and now there's no more bandwidth caps, I

341
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:54,360
think then that's where cloud gaming really starts to get its foot in the door and really

342
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,620
start to take off.

343
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,260
So let's see.

344
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,440
Going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network as 100 Matt says, I think Sony would

345
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,920
like to do that, but it depends on what Sony streaming deals has with other services.

346
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,620
The obvious thing would be for there to be a Sony streaming service for its movies and

347
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,620
shows.

348
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,500
But in order for that to happen, they would have to void all their deals with other services,

349
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,100
which isn't happening anytime soon.

350
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,700
Maybe they could leverage something in their future deals.

351
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,580
I don't know, maybe there's something where maybe you don't stream the movie so they get

352
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,060
around it that way.

353
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,660
But I remember a day and time when Sony sold movies right on their store, did they stop

354
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,660
doing that?

355
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,220
I thought they were going to at some point.

356
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
I can't remember.

357
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,420
Does Sony still sell stuff directly on their store?

358
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,120
Like you can rent or buy?

359
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,880
I thought they I thought they were going to stop, but I feel like they still do.

360
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,700
So that might be how they get around it is you're not streaming it.

361
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,140
You're renting it.

362
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,820
As you can do with Sony stores since the PlayStation three days.

363
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,700
Fifth Dream does point out, I've got 5G with no campus, my home Internet, and I'm in a

364
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,780
tiny town.

365
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,540
Mike Deaf says, don't we all already have 5G because we got the vaccine?

366
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,380
I wish that were the case.

367
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,900
And wants to point out, it's a joke, OK?

368
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
It's a joke.

369
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
But it was funny.

370
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,540
I like that.

371
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
Let's see.

372
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,740
As Joe points out, Marvel had a deal with Netflix for the Marvel shows.

373
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,100
I would like Jessica Jones and those.

374
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,580
But when Disney Plus came along, they let those streaming deals on those shows licenses

375
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,980
run out before putting them on Disney Plus.

376
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,940
So anyway, it'll be interesting to see what picks up with this.

377
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,340
I wonder if it will be true that we will see it this week.

378
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,140
I guess stay tuned and find out.

379
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,700
So we might be talking about this again next week when we have some facts.

380
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,520
But until then, let's talk about the facts of our gaming weeks and the types of things

381
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,140
that we've been playing this week.

382
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,800
I will go to Dark Sakura first.

383
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,860
How was your gaming week?

384
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,420
It was it was pretty eventful.

385
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:12,460
I in struggling mightily, I managed to get all of the killer adepts for Dead by Daylight.

386
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,760
Some of them surprisingly quickly.

387
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:20,380
I was super worried about getting Deathslinger because, well, he's pretty difficult for me

388
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,940
to play effectively.

389
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:28,820
And I got his adept on I played two games with him and got it on the first game.

390
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:34,200
And so and then I got Bubba by basically playing super sweaty.

391
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,340
But I was tired of him and I got him on Larry's of all of all site of all levels.

392
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:48,900
So yay me and and then I finished Chrono Trigger.

393
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:58,740
And I had that pull up on if I was going to do all the endings or if I was going to start

394
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
a new game.

395
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,460
So I just put it up a poll and apparently it will start a new game.

396
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,540
So I put up three options.

397
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,500
I put up Star Ocean.

398
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,700
I put up Terranigma and I put up Seiken Densetsu 3 or Trials of Mana.

399
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,000
And so Seiken Densetsu 3 won.

400
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,980
And so I started that one last night.

401
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,540
And booed at that because I voted for Terranigma and I was the first person to vote in that

402
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
poll.

403
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
Thank you very much.

404
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,700
I took a screenshot and sent it to you and said, close it.

405
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,700
I can't close it.

406
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
It doesn't let you close it.

407
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,700
I know.

408
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
But come on.

409
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:39,180
So but at any rate, the people have spoken, it was a pretty big margin.

410
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:45,860
But that means that I'll be doing my next one to vote between Star Ocean and Terranigma

411
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,100
and I'll probably will do Terranigma next.

412
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,260
I just have to get and I'm not going to do everybody's playthrough for Seiken Densetsu

413
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,260
3.

414
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:04,380
I'm just doing Angela's playthrough just because Angela is absolutely ridiculous.

415
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:11,780
And then yeah, that's that's really it.

416
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:26,060
I also I've been trying to find a way to to get a version of Paprium, which I don't know

417
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:40,460
if you know what Paprium is, but it's a fairly recent Sega Mega Drive slash Genesis release.

418
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:46,260
But that it was it has like all these extra chips built into the the cartridge and everything.

419
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,340
And it's this crazy cyberpunk beat them up.

420
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,340
That sometimes works.

421
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,020
It's had problems at a pretty long Kickstarter for it too.

422
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:04,940
And some of the reviews out there are not super favorable as far as the the way it's

423
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,980
been working or some of the glitching that's been going on in it.

424
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,860
But I really I still really want to want to play it.

425
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:18,060
So I'm working on trying to get my hands on a copy of Paprium one way or another.

426
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:23,460
Bobby, I was just gonna say real quick, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I considered streaming

427
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,620
the Live Alive SNES ROM, not trying to step on Jamie's toes, though.

428
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,700
Well, I mean, that wasn't one of the options.

429
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,020
And plus, as a streamer, like you're you're going to have to step on toes.

430
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,660
There's only so many hours in the day and a lot of people that want to stream.

431
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,820
So I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about that too much.

432
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,220
Like, you know, play what's fun.

433
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,300
On top of that, though, I am streaming games that I own.

434
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,620
So there's that.

435
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,820
To get to get out of that legal gray area.

436
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,700
Yeah, I get it.

437
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,700
Yeah.

438
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
Yeah.

439
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,860
My my copy of Seiken Densetsu 3 is somewhere.

440
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:06,540
And I probably actually I think I still need to read to get myself another copy of Terranigma

441
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,380
because I don't know what happened to my cartridge.

442
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,020
I wonder if they're easy to acquire.

443
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,020
I don't think they are.

444
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,020
It might be a hard one.

445
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,940
Yeah, I just and I know we've got we've got.

446
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,620
If all else fails, you know, I do also, though, have Mother 3 and I might play a translated

447
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,500
Mother 3, but it it depends.

448
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:32,100
So but anyway, that's a that's my gaming week.

449
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:38,100
Oh, and we had a crap load of pinball happening while I was trying to stream on Thursday.

450
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,780
We hosted Pinball League.

451
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,820
Oh, wow.

452
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,740
A lot of people in my house, it was loud and thank God for noise canceling headphones.

453
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,380
All right.

454
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,180
Loki, we'll go to you.

455
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,180
How is your gaming week?

456
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:56,180
It's more Minecraft, as usual, you know, so I was doing a lot of video editing this week.

457
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,700
I put out another episode of the Deep Dark World, which is doing all right.

458
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,500
The first one's got a thousand views on it now, which is great.

459
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,540
Second one, not as much, but, you know, it's fine.

460
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,860
And then just working on my new NerdCraft episode right now, building a copper, a big

461
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,860
copper farm.

462
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
So.

463
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,620
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

464
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,620
Excellent.

465
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,980
Well, good luck on your next video.

466
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,180
Look forward to seeing it.

467
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:26,860
Let's see my gaming week, honestly, not super exciting because I had a show last night.

468
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,780
That's why I guess I'm not I'm turned the wrong way, but this is a very kind gift for

469
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,560
my friend Genevieve, who came to the show last night, these flowers behind me.

470
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,060
So we did we did a live stage production of the movie Clue, which is my favorite movie

471
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,900
of all time.

472
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,940
And I kept it kind of coy and under wraps.

473
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,340
I had a surprise role in the in the production.

474
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,860
I played Yvette, the maid, in the Clue production.

475
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
And it was a lot of fun.

476
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
We madame?

477
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,860
We madame.

478
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,580
I just want to powder my nose.

479
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,860
So yeah, that was it was a lot of fun.

480
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,160
Like the cast was amazing.

481
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,740
And am I saying that just because I worked with them for all these rehearsals for a one

482
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,360
night show?

483
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
They are no.

484
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Well, yes and no.

485
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,460
They are truly an amazing group, really.

486
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,820
And I have to thank one of the other performers who played Miss Scarlet last night, Miss Mars,

487
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,220
is really to thank for my makeup and my wig looking as great as they did because she's

488
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,940
a hairstylist by day.

489
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:31,160
And she was like, I can probably work with this and really made the look come full circle.

490
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,460
So I'm very thankful to her for that.

491
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,300
And just the whole- Did you feel gorgeous in fishnets?

492
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,660
Yvette doesn't really wear fishnets.

493
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,980
She wears black hosiery.

494
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,020
I thought she wore fishnets for some reason.

495
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,300
Because your traditional French maid look is fishnets.

496
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,020
So it's one of your mind is one of those Mandela effect things where you assume she has them

497
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
too.

498
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,060
I'm sorry.

499
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,060
So I had that.

500
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,540
But yeah, I mean, it was fun.

501
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:04,300
Oh, I also officially like I don't do these drag things very often, but I thought it would

502
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,900
be fun to officially have a drag persona for when I do these things.

503
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,960
And so I officially debuted Dale Satan.

504
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,740
So D-A-Y-L-E-S-A-Y-T-O-N.

505
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,460
And I think most of you can get the joke there.

506
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,780
So Dale Satan is my name when I perform.

507
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,340
But am I going to do that all the time?

508
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,340
No.

509
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,740
It's like a once a year for a funny show thing.

510
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,480
But the show was great.

511
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
We had a great time.

512
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Yeah.

513
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
Is that isn't chat?

514
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Hey, is that was there.

515
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,780
So ask is that whatever you want to ask about the show?

516
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,780
Yeah.

517
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,260
I would say I am so proud of the tech crew as well, because one of the things that they

518
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,960
came through on that really and I think it might still be on the Instagram story at Amber

519
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,840
Sweet Shadowcast.

520
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,800
They actually rigged a full chandelier out of PVC pipe.

521
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,980
So when a vet shoots the chandelier and it almost falls on top of Colonel Mustard, they

522
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,200
actually had a chandelier that fell like we were at Phantom of the Opera.

523
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,880
It was awesome.

524
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,320
That chandelier got fucking wrecked the second time because it drops again in one of the

525
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
endings.

526
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,320
Spoiler alert.

527
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,060
It got fucking wrecked the second time, but it happened.

528
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,560
It was it was pretty great.

529
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Oh, yeah.

530
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,000
Azet is talking about the guard dogs.

531
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
OK.

532
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,400
Actually, really funny story about that.

533
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,300
So we have to double up on some roles to make that happen, because it's a very big cast.

534
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:28,540
So the dog, the cook and the cop were all played by the same person.

535
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,240
And originally and they I think they did the same performance.

536
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
They use them, they pronounce.

537
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,620
So I'm going to say they they did the same performance in twenty eighteen.

538
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:46,180
I think they played the same role, but they use like a dog suit, like I go to like a bed.

539
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:53,740
What do you the onesies that are Japanese inspired, Kiku Rumi, Kiku Rumi.

540
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,740
That's it.

541
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
OK.

542
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
It was one of those, but a dog.

543
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,780
And so they were going to do that again.

544
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,260
And they were but they were having a hard time with the costume change because you have

545
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,460
to get from the dog to the cook really fast.

546
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:13,420
So somebody came up with the bright idea, like, oh, I have this dog puppet that would

547
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,420
work great.

548
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,380
And it was it was perfect.

549
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,220
Like it literally looked like triumph, the insult comic doc.

550
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,540
And so the dog.

551
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,820
So they would just poke the dog hand out of the thing, go bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

552
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,320
It was so fucking funny.

553
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,420
Like that's the thing about that show.

554
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,840
It's this movie is like thirty five years old.

555
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,800
It's getting really old, OK?

556
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,820
But like, it's still so funny every time I watch it.

557
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,100
And just these little things that we were doing with the live performance to make it

558
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:49,780
even funnier, like, you know, having a dude play a vet and having, you know, a puppet

559
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:55,140
dog play the barking dogs that scare Mr. Body were just were just great.

560
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,180
And I have to really compliment the person I'm sorry, I will get to video games.

561
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,920
I just have to compliment our guy that played Mr. Body.

562
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:09,300
He was so over the top sleazeball and did so good in the role that we thought, wouldn't

563
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,940
it be funny if he also played the singing telegram girl?

564
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,020
And so he did.

565
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,740
And of course, played them completely different and like had these little like sparkling booty

566
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
shorts for the end.

567
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,500
Of course, the telegram girl scene always gets huge applause, huge applause.

568
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,100
But it was it was the loudest this time I've ever heard it.

569
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,100
It was great.

570
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
I had so much fun.

571
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,860
I really want them to do the show again.

572
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,580
But it's probably going to be a show that's on a two year cycle.

573
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,780
It's just it's such an ordeal to put on.

574
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,060
It's harder than Rocky Horror, especially from a tech perspective.

575
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,060
So anyway.

576
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,060
All right.

577
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,880
So as you can see, I can talk about that because that was my week, basically.

578
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,260
But I did try to get in some games.

579
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,020
I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14.

580
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,060
I'm still playing Death by Daylight.

581
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,300
Like maybe I'm not streaming a lot like Dark Sakura, but I still play quite a bit.

582
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,780
I still love Sadako as a killer.

583
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,120
I've been getting bullied on her, but I don't care.

584
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,980
Like I've been playing around with new builds.

585
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:13,520
I have this build I really like where you use the add on that when the survivors heal

586
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,940
each other, they transfer corruption to each other.

587
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,940
And then you use the video add ons that they gain.

588
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,360
That's like the ocean one, right?

589
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,860
That just shows her eyeball.

590
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,700
No, it's a no, no.

591
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,700
Yeah.

592
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Yeah.

593
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,700
The yellow add on is that.

594
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Yes.

595
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
So.

596
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,700
Yeah.

597
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
So that's a fun build.

598
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,680
So I like and then I just warp around to TVs to intentionally give people corruption.

599
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,760
And it works pretty well.

600
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,120
So there's that.

601
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,280
And then I got my survivor to 50.

602
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,920
I played her in Gideon's and that was an interesting experience.

603
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,920
I always get fucking mid which with her and I don't know what it is.

604
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,640
I either get the corn actually, I've only had the corn with her.

605
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,720
And then I had Gideon's and that was actually pretty funny and Gideon's because you can

606
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,080
use it to go upstairs and downstairs quickly.

607
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,520
The Yeah.

608
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,960
Is that is that the saw map?

609
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Is that the same thing?

610
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Yeah.

611
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
The game?

612
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Okay.

613
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Yeah.

614
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Yeah.

615
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Yeah.

616
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Yeah.

617
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
Because I was about to say that.

618
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
Yeah.

619
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Okay.

620
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
Yeah.

621
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
So yeah.

622
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Kind of makes me miss Hawkins a little bit.

623
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
The only other game that I really played a little bit of and I didn't actually play the

624
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
game.

625
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
I played the demo.

626
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
So full disclosure.

627
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
I played the stranger paradise final fantasy demo.

628
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,960
Finally.

629
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Like I was like, Oh, I need to get around.

630
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
I played this.

631
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,840
I downloaded it on series X and I played it.

632
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,400
And I got to admit the first five minutes, 10 minutes when I was going through the tutorial,

633
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,840
I was like, I hate this.

634
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,360
I really hate this.

635
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,080
Like I do not like this at all, but like, and it's something about the battles where

636
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,280
I'm just like this battle is yeah.

637
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,320
It's DJ Rama S says in chat, the controls are God awful.

638
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,280
Yes, they are.

639
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,840
But when I was able to get away from playing the swords class and play the, I don't know

640
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,600
if it's supposed to be like the pugilist or whatever, but you basically have the double

641
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,240
knives much better.

642
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,140
And then I got the mage unlocked much, much better playing that.

643
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,200
So I did have fun playing the other jobs.

644
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,440
So I haven't gotten the whole way through the demo yet somehow.

645
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,740
I know I've just been playing like a little bit.

646
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,960
I still don't love the battles, but I'm trying to see if it grows on me.

647
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,040
I don't think it's going to $60 grow on me, but I think it might like $40 grow on me.

648
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,320
We'll see.

649
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,960
Quest Buster says Rob hates chaos.

650
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,020
Okay.

651
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,560
When those that have played the full game, tell me, is the demo literally the opening

652
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,380
of the full game?

653
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:39,220
Because like there's these things where he's just like, I swear to God, this is the plot.

654
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,660
I got to kill chaos.

655
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,660
I don't know why, but I just woke up and I had a vision that I have to kill chaos.

656
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
What?

657
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,140
You guys have to kill chaos too?

658
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,260
Then we got to go kill chaos together.

659
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,100
Like that is literally the plot of the game.

660
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,480
And I'm like, is, is that like all the exposition you actually get?

661
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,720
Because in some ways, like how fucking terrible, but in other ways it's like, it's so bad.

662
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,780
It's kind of good.

663
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:14,860
I'm like, is this a cleverly written parody about the story in 1980s video games and how

664
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,700
there wasn't a lot of expedition exposition?

665
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,020
And why are we killing this bad guy?

666
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:25,980
Just because we feel like we have to bio shock twist, like what spoiler alert for a decade

667
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,980
old game?

668
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,740
Like what, what, what is going on here?

669
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:35,500
Like Bobby Black Wolf says, I mean, it is a retelling of final fantasy one.

670
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:41,140
I thought, yeah, that's why I was like, okay, is this just like a clever commentary on what

671
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:45,060
we were told to do in video games in 1987?

672
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,980
Fifth Dream in chat says, Rob just summed up 90% of the reviews of this game.

673
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,980
It's terrible.

674
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,980
It's great.

675
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,240
Wait, what is it?

676
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,720
Final fantasy origins, straight strangers of paradise.

677
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,880
Oh that.

678
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
Yeah.

679
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Yeah.

680
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,880
I don't even know the actual name.

681
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
Yes.

682
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,960
It's team it's made by team Ninja because I was ready to say, Oh, this is very clearly

683
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,440
done in final fantasy 15s engine, but I guess not because team Ninja did it and I don't

684
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,820
know why they would have that engine.

685
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,420
So I was like expect better of team Ninja.

686
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Do we though?

687
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,240
Cause sometimes they miss the mark there.

688
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,040
A lot of people really hated Metroid other M too.

689
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,800
I didn't hate it as much as other people did, but I feel like team Ninja does some

690
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
controversial stuff sometimes.

691
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,640
So so let's see quest Buster and expect better of them.

692
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,080
Quest Buster and chat says Rob's take is pretty accurate from the streamers.

693
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,440
I've watched play the game.

694
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,160
The story is whacked, but this gameplay is really good.

695
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,060
I will say I saw a cut scene like spoiler alert, but is it really when the story is

696
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,060
like this?

697
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,980
Is it really like I saw this cut scene where like this boss is trying to introduce them

698
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,980
himself.

699
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,180
And he's like, I am lick the God of chaos.

700
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,420
And the guy goes, I don't give a fuck who you are and jumps up and tries to punch him

701
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,420
in the face.

702
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,900
And then gets like bunched back.

703
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,300
And I'm like, this is so ridiculous.

704
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,700
Like I just, that would totally be me as a hero.

705
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,020
It's like, did I ask who you were?

706
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
I don't care.

707
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,020
Get them away.

708
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,480
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I just, Bobby Blackwell says, I just felt because I never played a

709
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
souls game.

710
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,080
I wasn't feeling the gameplay.

711
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Good news.

712
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,400
There's a full on Bobby Blackwell mode.

713
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,160
Like there's not only like casual difficulty, which is what I'm playing on, but then there's

714
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,680
like easy casual on top of that, which I didn't even turn on, but Bobby, you could, and nobody's

715
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
going to judge you.

716
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,680
Nobody's going to know.

717
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Um, where like you just, you don't even like, I think your, your, uh, counter your, uh,

718
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,400
party members never die in that mode.

719
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
So yeah.

720
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Yeah.

721
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,840
Oh, Bobby says it plays like a souls game.

722
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
Yeah.

723
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
It still does.

724
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
It still does.

725
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
I'll do that.

726
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Dark soccer.

727
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,840
I, the demos free.

728
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,720
You might want to consider just giving it a go for the laughs.

729
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,600
Um, uh, oh wait.

730
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Oh shit.

731
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Yeah.

732
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,320
You don't have a PS five or an Xbox series X, huh?

733
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,320
And I don't think it's not, it's probably not on Stadia.

734
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,620
I think it is on PC, but not Stadia.

735
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:19,640
So I'll look at Stadia and there's actually a big, um, petition out to try to get, uh,

736
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,600
um, Elden ring on, uh, on Stadia.

737
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:29,680
I saw that and I would have signed it except I don't sign anything from change.org because

738
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,940
once you do it, you get 50,000 fucking emails from them and you have to like unsubscribe

739
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,760
several times before they'll believe you.

740
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
Yeah.

741
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,440
The mailing list sacred Jade and chat says squares, triple a game quality has suffered

742
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,720
a lot in the last few years.

743
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
I'm not going to disagree.

744
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,960
I do want to remind this is, this is really a team Ninja game under, you know, but ultimately

745
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,480
I guess square really kind of publishes it.

746
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:58,200
Um, however, I choke about GP, which I think was on our list for last week when we didn't

747
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
get around to it.

748
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,320
Obviously choke about GP has not been faring so great either.

749
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,280
And a lot of it has to do with the way they built the microtransaction system in that

750
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,920
game, which is a little bit poopy.

751
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
Caca.

752
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,840
So, um, yeah, I did play, I would have talked about that during my gaming week last week

753
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,280
because I did play the demo for that.

754
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,160
I wasn't convinced to buy the full game.

755
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,000
And that really says something considering like I loved chocobo racing on PS one.

756
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,340
I'll defend that game.

757
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,060
And honestly playing chocobo GP made me go, okay, is this a Rose colored glasses thing?

758
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,560
It has to be right.

759
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,560
I don't know.

760
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
Anyway.

761
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,560
All right.

762
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,980
That was it for our gaming weeks.

763
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,560
Let's move on and get, okay.

764
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,240
Mike deaf says you're not the only one Rob.

765
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
Yeah.

766
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,200
So I know there's, there's other people that feel the same way I do.

767
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
It's just very disappointing.

768
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,200
All right.

769
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,440
We have more gaming news to get into because we missed the news last week.

770
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,480
Let's get into it.

771
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,960
What is going on in the gaming world?

772
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
Loki?

773
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,320
Well, since you were speaking about chocobo GP, uh, let's talk about Gran Turismo seven,

774
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:03,160
which also has horrible, um, microtransactions in their game.

775
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,880
And so because of that, people aren't happy that a lot of the cars are only available

776
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,060
if you purchase them through, um, this store.

777
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:17,420
And apparently you can grind the currency in game, but obviously they made it really

778
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,300
grindy because they want you to buy the currency, the buy it, you know?

779
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:31,700
Uh, so the, the game has a score of 2.5 on Metacritic and, uh, obviously it's kind of

780
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:40,300
getting back up, but you know, the point is that it's, uh, it's unnecessarily grindy.

781
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,260
There's no very, not a lot of variation in the races.

782
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,140
And it's just unfortunate that they don't get to have all the cars.

783
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,300
That's why, I mean, like, was it not even like a week ago, there was a report about

784
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:58,020
folks, um, creating a like script in like you, if you play remote play on your PC, there's

785
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,420
a script that you can run that basically AFK grinds it for you.

786
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,500
And that, you know, Sony wasn't happy about that.

787
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,180
Well, don't make your games a damn grindy then.

788
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:13,540
Um, and Sony apparently, or I should say polyphony, uh, digital will actually update the PlayStation

789
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,060
four and PlayStation five versions of the game.

790
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:22,580
Um, thanks to fan feedback, they've also given out 1 million free credits to each player.

791
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,140
That's been affected by that.

792
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:30,140
Um, and basically said, no, Hey, thank you for the continued support and feedback on

793
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,060
grantor was seven.

794
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,060
Your voices have not gone unheard.

795
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:39,700
Um, and they would apologize for the frustration and confusion it caused by their patch, uh,

796
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:45,020
last week or last updates, which resulted in, oh, and I forgot to mention another reason

797
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,660
probably why that's been review bombed.

798
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:53,220
It's, um, a game that has to be connected online all the time, even in single player.

799
00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:00,140
And so it was unplayable for a few days because Sony's services were down thanks to a DDoS

800
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,620
attack.

801
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:06,700
Um, and so, you know, not only was there the service outage, but they're adjusting the

802
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:12,460
in-game economy, um, or they made adjustments to the in-game economy, which would made without

803
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,220
clear explanation.

804
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,980
So did they make it worse with a patch?

805
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,340
Um, I don't know.

806
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,620
That sounds horrible, but they're going to be doing a lot of different things to fix it.

807
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:27,140
I just don't understand how they didn't know this was happening.

808
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,060
Also, this was a game they charged $70 for on PlayStation five.

809
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,900
So, you know,

810
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,420
the whole money grabbing thing is disgusting.

811
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,940
What happened to just making a game?

812
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,580
Uh, Fortnite happened.

813
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,180
And what I mean by that is that this is, this is loot box 2022.

814
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,180
Now it's the season passes.

815
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,260
It was rhetorical.

816
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,260
But, but it's, it's worse though.

817
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,500
And then I get it that Fortnite happened in Fortnite is a free to play game.

818
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:58,540
The problem is these guys want, you know, money on both ends.

819
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,900
You know, usually it used to be like, Hey, you pay for a game up front.

820
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,580
You get the full game and that's that, or you have a free to play game and there's

821
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,500
microtransactions in it because obviously they need money in order to run the game.

822
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:16,580
But now these AAA studios figured out, Hey, we can, we can basically charge up

823
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:21,860
front for this game and we can also charge microtransactions for additional things.

824
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,660
Or, Hey, we can do this and we can design a game that be even grindier than it needs

825
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:33,540
to be to push people into the microtransactions it's just, it's greed

826
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,460
and, and it will eventually, you know, bite them in the butt, but

827
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,260
well, it is look at the reception here.

828
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,540
Look at the reception with chocobo GP, how many, like how many

829
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,900
thousands of copies of this thing?

830
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,580
I mean, they it's, it's chocobo GP.

831
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,180
Like, I don't, no, one's learning a lesson.

832
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,580
All they've learned is to like dial it back a little bit.

833
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,500
You know, we'll just, we'll push it until they start complaining.

834
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,300
We'll dial it back.

835
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,540
They'll look at, Oh, look at how much better this game is because they dial it

836
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,380
back and then they slowly move it back up again.

837
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,100
You know, what's interesting, you know, a game that gets away with this charging for

838
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,820
the game and then charge pay a debit daylight.

839
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,140
It does it.

840
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,300
They have their, their season passes in there.

841
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,180
I think maybe part of the reason they're able to get away with it is twofold.

842
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,620
One, even though, yes, it is like a $20 game.

843
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,180
It's a $20 game, so it's not 60, but they also, they give it away so often.

844
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,300
Like it was an Epic giveaway recently.

845
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,700
It's on Xbox game pass.

846
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,900
So they give it all away.

847
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:29,940
Awesome.

848
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,020
They give it away because they make most of their money in microtransactions.

849
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,540
Exactly.

850
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:39,300
No, but the other thing too, though, is that when you buy the, the season, you,

851
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:44,060
it's not like you have to renew it and you don't have to buy it to get full

852
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,140
enjoyment out of the game.

853
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,660
That's true.

854
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,580
You don't have to, it's, it's cosmic.

855
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,380
It really is cosmetics only.

856
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,500
They don't get any of the content behind it.

857
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,620
So I guess maybe there is that.

858
00:43:53,660 --> 00:44:00,500
I'm referring to buying killers and survivors, which now survivors cosmetic,

859
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,380
except for some of them are noisy than others, Jill Valentine.

860
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,020
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

861
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:09,340
Um, but I mean, I think the only actual value you get of buying anybody is going

862
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,540
to be for the killers because the killers are all going to have different power

863
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:17,300
sets, but then, you know, there's me who is a fashion whore and the only reason

864
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:22,540
that my survivors exist is for, to put pretty clothes on them and I will, I'll

865
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,260
buy outfits.

866
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,140
I am, I am part of the problem in that.

867
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,500
Well, I was going to say too, I'm like certain survivor talents are kind of

868
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,380
mandatory, but the, the, the one that is like, you can get them in the shrine

869
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:39,740
sometimes, sometimes rarely if you're lucky, but I was going to say bill borrow

870
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,580
time is the only one I think of that's like a mandatory talent and bill out of

871
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:48,020
the, um, out of the store, the shrine during the five-year anniversary event.

872
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,260
So it's available like one week out of the year.

873
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,340
No, I got it before that.

874
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,580
And, and, and Dead Hard was available that way too.

875
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,900
So, and to go back to like the, the Gran Turismo 7 thing.

876
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:03,900
So here's the other shady thing about it is they altered the microtransactions

877
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,020
and how grindy it was after the reviews came out.

878
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,500
Yeah, that's the other thing is that you've, a lot of the, that Chocobo GP

879
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,220
had that too, not to keep harping on that, but it is a recent example.

880
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,020
A lot of that didn't show itself until after the reviews were coming out.

881
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,020
You can't trust reviews anymore and not the reviewer's fault for a change.

882
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,420
It's not that you can trust reviews.

883
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,140
Yeah, you just can't trust AAA studios anymore.

884
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,620
Yeah.

885
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,140
Anyway.

886
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,420
Well, speaking of changes, um, another game is having some controversial

887
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,980
changes, but of a different sort.

888
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,980
Um, this is Pokemon Go, which, you know, I've talked about, I've played quite

889
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,620
a bit and, um, I just, I actually went on an hour walk today and I played a

890
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,140
bit of Pokemon Go while I was out.

891
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:52,580
Um, and, um, yeah, Pokemon Go talked about this week, their latest community day.

892
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,820
Uh, community day is coming back for April.

893
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,460
It's been around this whole time, even during the pandemic.

894
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,340
Um, but they're doing the stuffle is the Pokemon that's coming out.

895
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,140
This is new because this is the first time they're doing a community day for

896
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,300
a Pokemon that has yet to be released.

897
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,180
So, you know, they're just now getting into the, um, Alolan Pokemon,

898
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,620
the Pokemon from a Pokemon X and Y.

899
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,180
So this will be stuffles debut in the game.

900
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,860
And it's a very cute little pink bear.

901
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,020
So a lot of people want to get it fine.

902
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:27,100
I think a lot of people are excited about the choice, but with this, they are

903
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:33,020
reverting community days back to three hours, community days used to be a six

904
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,060
hour window during the pandemic.

905
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:39,300
And now they are reverting as they have started to revert other pre pandemic

906
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,620
change or other pandemic changes back to their pre pandemic state.

907
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,100
Um, there are other things that they have done.

908
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,620
Uh, the incense change has been highly controversial.

909
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,940
Uh, what happened during the pandemic, they made incense change so that you

910
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,660
would get one Pokemon a minute, and now it's back to a Pokemon every five minutes.

911
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,100
What I notice a lot of people don't report on with that.

912
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:06,100
And I think to be fair to Niantic, that's if you're stationary.

913
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,620
If you're moving, you spawn way more of them.

914
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,260
So you do have to be moving and the incense will, and not everybody's

915
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:14,900
reporting that.

916
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,260
And I think, you know, no matter how you feel about the issue, you got to

917
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,700
debate it with all the facts.

918
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,620
And so they do spawn more if you're moving.

919
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,900
Um, and then of course the, the change in the hours for Pokemon go community

920
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,140
day is not very popular.

921
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:33,220
Um, you know, I don't like it when a community day is a Sundays from two to

922
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,580
five, cause then I can't really do them because of this show.

923
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:41,460
Um, so, you know, the whole point is just to squeeze people into buying

924
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,580
microtransactions.

925
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:48,100
That's what it is because they're trying to feed the FOMO of these players that

926
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,140
want this thing.

927
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,900
And they're like, well, there's not a lot of time, you know, to get all the

928
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,780
Pokemon that you want.

929
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,700
So they're going to try to push you into the incense and push you into whatever

930
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,780
that you want to, you know, pay for to be able to get it quicker.

931
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,860
And so that's really what it is.

932
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:08,100
They're squeezing players for more money because they're probably not making as

933
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,980
much money.

934
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,380
Now that people have gone back to work and are, you know, doing that type of

935
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:13,700
stuff.

936
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,460
And so I had a great solution to that.

937
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,340
I just stopped playing.

938
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,140
Yeah.

939
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,660
Ultimately, if you're that upset about it, that's the only thing that's going to

940
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,580
talk is to stop playing.

941
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:31,780
Um, I, I, I just, yeah, I, I don't love the three hour windows.

942
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,060
I also don't love that.

943
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:38,100
They're trying to say, are players voice that this is what they want to happen

944
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,100
because this is to get everybody out in the community together and all this.

945
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,900
And I'm just kind of like shifting blame to somebody else.

946
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,700
You're sorry.

947
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,780
I, I would, I would agree.

948
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,580
You mean people who work for Niantic that also play the game?

949
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:58,180
I would, I would agree with the part of the statistic where probably people were

950
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,740
only playing for three hours during that six hour window, but they were playing at

951
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,420
a time that worked for them.

952
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,260
And what's it going to hurt?

953
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,060
Who cares?

954
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,620
Yeah.

955
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,660
What's it hurting then?

956
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,700
Like you're not like flipping a server.

957
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,980
You're not popping on another server or something like that to get this Pokemon

958
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:15,220
out.

959
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,980
It's just, it's a thing in a game.

960
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,660
You're flipping a digital switch.

961
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:24,340
You're, you're doing this to push people into microtransactions.

962
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,340
That is why you're shortening the window.

963
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:31,060
In my opinion, every community day should be modeled after what they do in December,

964
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:36,100
where it's all weekend long that you have the increased spawn and then maybe your triple

965
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,020
XP and Stardust and those sorts of bonuses are limited to a window.

966
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:40,740
Fine.

967
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:45,860
But at least the people aren't missing out on the Pokemon or worse, the special move

968
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,780
that Pokemon only get during those times because they can't play during a certain window.

969
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,340
I think there's gotta be an answer in there somewhere.

970
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,260
Now, as far as the incense things goes,

971
00:49:55,220 --> 00:50:00,580
I think Niantic's biggest issue there was with communication because playing other big

972
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,380
shock, right?

973
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,500
Because playing other Niantic games like Ingress, there's been a very different tone to the

974
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,740
communications about the pandemic changes.

975
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:13,380
And that is that every three months or every month, even they're coming out and saying

976
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:18,740
on a quarterly basis, we are reviewing these changes and we will re look and see when we're

977
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,420
going to reverse these basically.

978
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,060
And they basically list out this, this, this, and this.

979
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:28,340
So they what they've done differently, in my opinion, is they have never set an expectation

980
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,420
that these changes are going to be permanent.

981
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,820
When they did these changes and Pokemon go much different tone, they set the expectation

982
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,260
these changes will be permanent.

983
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,900
And now the fan base is holding them accountable for that.

984
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,060
Whereas an Ingress, they would be permanent.

985
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,580
They never got that impression.

986
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:48,020
Yeah, they said they said it in that original when I remember because it was the 80 meter

987
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:52,340
distance thing specifically and they got called the fuck out on that and they had to revert

988
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:52,980
it back.

989
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,620
It was that.

990
00:50:54,660 --> 00:51:01,220
So with the with the whole incense thing, I understand that Niantic's whole thing is

991
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:06,180
they are trying to build games where you need to go out in the real world and explore parks,

992
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,020
explore areas and all this stuff.

993
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:12,740
So I get why they're doing that type of change.

994
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:17,300
I think they should have communicated a lot sooner and a lot better that these changes

995
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,340
were always temporary.

996
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:25,780
However, and this is a big however, there's still a larger conversation to be had about

997
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:33,380
map in that game, the map updates and how Pokemon spawn, because I'm pretty sure how

998
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:41,300
the Pokemon spawn is based off of an Ingress algorithm about how the Ingress XM spawns.

999
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:48,980
I'm almost positive Pokemon spawn more more densely in areas that are densely populated

1000
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:54,660
with XM and Ingress, which is populated off of map data that is 10 years old.

1001
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:02,180
It's as old as the I am not talking about what the lines on the ground look like with

1002
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,860
the streets and everything.

1003
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:08,740
That's old, too, because that all comes off the open street map and Pokemon Go pulls that

1004
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,100
maybe once a year.

1005
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:16,180
All I know is that the park closest to where I live now doesn't exist in Pokemon Go.

1006
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,540
And that park has existed in open street maps for like two years.

1007
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,700
So I think Pokemon needs to be pulling in map data a little more frequently, but including

1008
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,580
the spawn points.

1009
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:31,460
What I'm trying to get to with Ingress is that like the population data that drives

1010
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,060
the score in Ingress has not been updated in 10 years.

1011
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:41,620
So, for example, a neighborhood here in the Sacramento area, Anatolia, you guys would

1012
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,260
know where that is.

1013
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,220
That's a new development out like sunrise and 50.

1014
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:45,940
Okay.

1015
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:53,300
If you were to field all of Anatolia, you'll get maybe 30 MU, meaning the map data thinks

1016
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,860
that 30 people live in that area, because when it was rural, there probably were 30

1017
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,380
people that lived in that area.

1018
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,260
But now there are thousands of people that live in that area.

1019
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,860
I'm illustrating that because that is the old map data that's causing Pokemon spawns

1020
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,380
to be stupid as well.

1021
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:15,460
And so I think Niantic needs to solve this problem of more regular map updates so that

1022
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:20,900
people feel like they're not seeing Pokemon when they go out and walk around, which is

1023
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,620
a very real issue.

1024
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,820
Anatolia has been there for like, how many years now?

1025
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,460
A part of it has, but it's gotten bigger.

1026
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,580
In at least like 5 to 10 years.

1027
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,580
Yeah, but it's gotten a lot bigger too.

1028
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:37,060
But Ingress is a 10 year old game, and that population data has literally never been updated.

1029
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:42,580
So Mike Def says the map actually got updated recently, but it's an area by area basis,

1030
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,260
but not the part I'm talking about.

1031
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:50,420
If you play Ingress and field new areas, you'll know exactly what I mean.

1032
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,300
And I'm telling you, everything that powers Pokemon go came out of Ingress.

1033
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:00,180
So there's one for one there.

1034
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:07,780
So anyway, SSG100Matt says there are times where Niantic gets on a moral high horse.

1035
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:11,620
They really want to stand on this high ground that our game is about moving around and we

1036
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,580
want to reward you for the moving around because exercise.

1037
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:18,340
Same thing happened when they cut the stop gym distance and they got rid of the 80 meter

1038
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:18,980
radius.

1039
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,380
People got upset about that and they had to reverse it.

1040
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,500
What does that say for people with disabilities?

1041
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,820
It's that people with disabilities can't move.

1042
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,020
Ever.

1043
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:35,780
Yeah, they're completely excluding an entire group of players who were probably thriving

1044
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,980
on having the COVID restrictions because it put them on more equal footing with other

1045
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,380
players.

1046
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:44,340
I would argue that there are a lot of games that exclude.

1047
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,180
I mean, what if somebody is blind?

1048
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,260
What if somebody is, you know, we've talked to people on this show that can't play certain

1049
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,700
games because they're blind.

1050
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,740
It is very hard to make a game that is accessible to 100% of the population.

1051
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,660
And it sucks.

1052
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:03,860
But that's, you know, and so the more we can do to make games accessible, then great.

1053
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:08,660
But I understand that the backbone of the game is being out and moving around and plenty

1054
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:13,380
of differently abled people can still get out and move around unless you are completely

1055
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,500
in a bedridden type of situation.

1056
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:23,380
But I think it's interesting that there isn't like an offline version of Pokemon Go because

1057
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,180
I would have thought they would have made a lot of money off of that at this point.

1058
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:29,380
But to be determined, I suppose.

1059
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,820
SG100 Mountain Chat says having six hour community days doesn't break the game.

1060
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:38,100
Having certain shiny rates at specific times doesn't break the game.

1061
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,780
Just be flexible with the community.

1062
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,140
That's all folks are asking.

1063
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:47,060
Yeah, I think that there should be a little more choice into, like, when you want to play

1064
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,180
that three hour window.

1065
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:54,260
And we know they can do phased events because that's what powers these virtual

1066
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,020
Go Fest and things like that.

1067
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,340
So anyway.

1068
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:05,380
All right, let's move on and talk about other old school franchises.

1069
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,020
Dark Sakura.

1070
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:12,340
Well, I'm sure that people who know their video game history are going to know what

1071
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,020
Colossal Cave Adventure is, right?

1072
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:25,700
It was a 1976 text adventure game, and it's actually being ported to a VR version by the

1073
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,140
founders of Sierra.

1074
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,780
That's Roberta and Ken Williams.

1075
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,260
They're doing this basically.

1076
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:39,860
Now, again, these are also the people that made, you know, King's Quest and Phantasmagoria,

1077
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:45,780
you know, basically like just the classics of our early gaming.

1078
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:55,860
But they're wanting to do a kind of like a real walking through adventure.

1079
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:04,260
Their new company is Cygnus Entertainment, and they have 12 full time employees working

1080
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:09,620
on the game, and they're not sure if they're going to do future games under Cygnus or if

1081
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:16,180
it's just going to be Colossal Cave 3D as the one, you know, the one time attempt.

1082
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:23,380
But looking at the trailer for it, it's actually really, really pretty.

1083
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:31,620
And it has like different elements from, you know, from the text adventure, but you're

1084
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,820
going around and actually working on it.

1085
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,060
So I think it's pretty, pretty neat.

1086
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:40,420
Now, I can't do VR at all.

1087
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,100
I mean, I could, but I will not.

1088
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:48,740
But looking at the trailer for it, it really seems like it's going to be, you know, just

1089
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,340
a complete full circle.

1090
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:59,140
You know, they've actually got on this thing that I'm reading, they're actually showing

1091
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:06,500
the text adventure running on a PDP, an old computer anyway.

1092
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:12,900
I don't remember the full model of it, but it's really just come a long way.

1093
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,540
I think that it's really awesome that they're doing that.

1094
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:24,740
Yeah, it's interesting because, you know, I get VR, like I have enjoyed it, you know,

1095
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:29,620
with things like Beat Saber, but I think there's a lot of VR stuff that just feels kind of

1096
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,620
like they're just shoving it in there because VR is like the cool new kid on the block.

1097
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:38,580
That being said, I'm very curious for Ken and Roberta Williams take on this because,

1098
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,860
again, these are folks that have been out of the industry for some time and been out

1099
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,500
traveling the world until they couldn't do that anymore.

1100
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,860
So I feel like it's an interesting, refreshing new take on this.

1101
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:54,100
And for whatever reason, they really feel like, you know, VR is the path for their game.

1102
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,180
And so it's interesting because it's a new take from a familiar place.

1103
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:02,980
And, you know, Ken and Roberta Williams were the very first that did a graphical

1104
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,300
the murder, I can't remember the name of the game, Murder House or whatever it was called.

1105
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:12,420
That first game that they did was like the first mystery house, the first graphical

1106
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,820
game that there was in an adventure sense.

1107
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,740
So it'd be interesting to see what their take is on VR.

1108
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,860
Mystery Quest.

1109
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,740
Mystery Quest?

1110
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,180
I thought it was something about a house.

1111
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,220
OK, but that's whatever.

1112
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:28,820
Well, there's also Mystery House, which is that current game that's out or Murder House

1113
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,460
or whatever.

1114
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:33,300
Yeah, that's it's like meant to look like an old ass game.

1115
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:33,620
Yeah.

1116
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:34,420
Yeah.

1117
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,780
So so I'm curious to see their take.

1118
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,140
Sierra also published like Leisure Suit Larry and Half Life.

1119
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,260
So I mean, yeah.

1120
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,500
Mystery House.

1121
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,500
OK, that was at the first Sierra game in 1980.

1122
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,540
OK, that was that was the one where it was like in the first like graphics.

1123
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:54,180
And I think Ken programmed it and Roberto wrote it, if I'm not mistaking.

1124
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,740
So, yeah, kind of anyway.

1125
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:00,980
But my point is, I'm just curious to see what, you know, grandpas take.

1126
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,900
And I mean that as a compliment.

1127
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,980
Their take on this is for VR.

1128
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:09,380
The only problem is I'm not buying an Oculus device to play it.

1129
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:13,540
So I'll just have to hear about it through others and see, you know, the footage and

1130
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:16,340
things like that or maybe play when I go to a friend's house.

1131
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:16,820
I don't know.

1132
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:24,660
But I it's going to take me a lot, a lot to support Metta and the VR thing.

1133
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,820
I really don't want to be bothered with it.

1134
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:31,060
So as long as that game remains exclusive to that, I guess I just have to hear about

1135
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:31,700
it second hand.

1136
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:32,840
So.

1137
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:34,660
All right.

1138
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:35,220
Anyway.

1139
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:35,460
Yeah.

1140
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,860
And Bobby says nobody's buying an Oculus device now.

1141
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,300
They're Metta devices.

1142
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:39,780
Yeah.

1143
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,380
But we all know how I feel about.

1144
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,460
Do I believe that company deserves to be called that?

1145
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:49,460
You know, I'm going to they're lucky I talk about them at all, to be quite honest.

1146
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:50,500
All right.

1147
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,260
Moving on.

1148
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,180
Something something a little different.

1149
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:54,680
Logie.

1150
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,780
Yeah, we're never going to call them that.

1151
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,260
Sorry.

1152
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,540
You know, that's just the way it is.

1153
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:01,880
So.

1154
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:08,740
Cyberpunk was a game that's been kind of rocky and they've been patching it and stuff.

1155
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,820
But now that cyberpunk is kind of.

1156
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,700
In like kind of a holding pattern right now, it's time to start thinking about the next

1157
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:23,700
Witcher game and CD Projekt Red has actually teased that there is the Witcher a new saga

1158
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:30,500
begins that's being worked on on Unreal five as opposed to their own red engine.

1159
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:38,580
And you know, it's not necessarily they haven't really just said when it's coming out or

1160
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,740
any details aside from a brief teaser.

1161
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:47,540
But we do know that they have promised pinky promised that they're not going to be crunching

1162
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:52,420
this time, despite the fact that last time they crunched.

1163
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:56,740
So they're promising, though, that they're not going to crunch their teams, but.

1164
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,980
It's coming at some point.

1165
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:08,340
I also find the news about their switch to Unreal five kind of interesting is it's

1166
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,140
kind of like, are they trying to say that?

1167
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:15,700
Because I feel like there's almost a similar battle going on at EA and the Frostbite engine.

1168
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,540
And like, you know, more companies are starting to be like, and maybe we should walk away

1169
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:23,940
from our proprietary engines and just go with the industry standard unreal because it keeps

1170
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:24,820
games on track.

1171
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,540
You know what I mean?

1172
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:28,660
Like, I guess it makes it easier to bring an outside talent to I don't know.

1173
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:31,460
Yeah, it might be easier for outside talent.

1174
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:36,340
You don't need to have so many, you know, designers working on the engine itself.

1175
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:42,100
You can just kind of, you know, add stuff to it, but not necessarily have to design

1176
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,220
it from scratch.

1177
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:47,140
Plus, it's probably their red engine is probably getting pretty old anyways, and they're

1178
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:52,500
probably getting to the point where, OK, we need to update this for what we want to do

1179
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,300
with the Witcher.

1180
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,860
And, you know, let's say it's a few years out or whatever.

1181
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:00,580
I mean, it's just probably easier just to have somebody else working on the engine instead

1182
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,260
of them working on the engine.

1183
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:08,100
So, yeah, yeah, maybe that's what led to some of the cyberpunk issues, you know, with all

1184
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,340
the honestly, maybe.

1185
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:15,140
And that's kind of why I think that part of it is almost I mean, the news that they're

1186
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:19,940
working on a new Witcher game, I mean, of course, but the news is going to be unreal

1187
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:20,420
instead.

1188
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:25,380
I think that's the very interesting part out of that quest buster in chat says the medallion

1189
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:30,260
buried in snow in the teaser image appears to be that of the Lynx, another Witcher school

1190
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:33,620
with ties to a new world kind of continent.

1191
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:37,860
So I mean, we might get a sense there, a hint about where the story is going.

1192
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:39,780
It'll be interesting.

1193
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,860
I'll also be interested to see how it might tie into the very popular Netflix series,

1194
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:48,740
which, you know, obviously is to thank, I think, a little bit for a lot of the Witcher's

1195
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:49,220
success.

1196
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:53,780
I mean, it's been mutually beneficial, the game and the Netflix show.

1197
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,940
And yes, I know it's all based on a book to begin with.

1198
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,180
So it's interesting.

1199
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:05,060
All right, moving on, let's talk about something that's coming back for next summer, because

1200
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:07,700
last week we talked a little bit.

1201
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:13,300
I know it wasn't on the podcast, but the story we did talk about was that the EA thing was

1202
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,300
not going to be coming back next summer.

1203
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,060
And it kind of led to a wider discussion on is E3 even going to come back?

1204
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,460
And I'm pretty sure the answer is no at this point.

1205
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,660
But what is going to come back?

1206
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:30,420
Valve's Steam Next Fest is going to be coming on June 13th and June 20th.

1207
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:36,420
And now to point out, there was just a spring version of this that just so it's not like

1208
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:41,860
it's a once a year thing, but it's interesting in particular that week that they chose is

1209
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:47,300
right around the time there would be an E3 type of thing and that they're already hyping

1210
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:54,020
it getting underway at one o'clock Eastern on June 13th through June 20th.

1211
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:59,860
They are saying hundreds of game demos will be available for folks to check out live streams

1212
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,940
featuring teams working on titles.

1213
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:07,860
But we don't know exactly what games, of course, are going to be featured as of yet.

1214
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:14,100
We just know that past versions featured Sable, Toem, The Wandering Village, and so forth.

1215
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,980
And I think this is very interesting because the story I'm looking at says the timing of

1216
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:22,100
this means it will likely overlap with this year's E3.

1217
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,900
While the Entertainment Software Association has yet to set a date for the annual conference,

1218
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,540
it has historically taken place in early to mid June.

1219
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,180
Well, I've got news, but it was last year.

1220
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,940
Yeah, I've got news for the news guy.

1221
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:37,780
There's not going to be an E3 this year.

1222
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,660
I mean, sure, it's not official yet.

1223
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,220
So I could get proven wrong.

1224
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:45,620
Fine.

1225
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:50,180
It wouldn't be the first time, but we're literally 10 weeks out, right?

1226
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:51,380
We're coming up on April.

1227
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:56,020
Next week is going to be the first week of April, and we're talking mid June, two and

1228
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:56,580
a half months.

1229
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,460
There's not going to be any three this year.

1230
01:05:59,460 --> 01:05:59,960
Come on.

1231
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,980
And now EA just canceled their event.

1232
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:03,860
Why did they do that?

1233
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,420
There's not going to be any three next to it.

1234
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,940
Anyway, let's move on to our Sacro.

1235
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:18,820
Well, you know, April is also, you know, my entire birthday.

1236
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,620
It took a whole month for me to be born.

1237
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:24,020
The entire month is how we celebrate your birthday.

1238
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,420
Yes, you make it extend for the whole period.

1239
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:26,920
Yes.

1240
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:36,820
So as reported by the New York Times, Netflix is buying another video game studio to expand

1241
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:40,340
their own fledgling video game services.

1242
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:47,060
They announced this past Thursday that they were buying Boss Fight Entertainment.

1243
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,100
It's a small studio based in Allen, Texas.

1244
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:58,820
They are a mobile game developer with 130 employees, and they also have bought one called

1245
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:04,820
Night School in September, and they also bought Next Games.

1246
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,420
They didn't say how much they paid for it.

1247
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:13,460
But with bringing in all of these smaller studios, you know, a bunch of small things

1248
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:14,900
can make up something pretty big.

1249
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:23,060
But the thing is, is that they're having to play a major catch-up game behind Google and

1250
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:23,560
Amazon.

1251
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:28,500
And now, you know, Amazon Luna is, I think, still in beta.

1252
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:34,820
I actually have a Luna account, but I mean, they're really trying to push into it.

1253
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,220
We'll see what they can do.

1254
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:42,900
I mean, I don't have a lot of hope at first, but then again, I love Stadia, so who knows?

1255
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:49,380
Yeah, I feel like Netflix is really trying to find its place at this table.

1256
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:54,580
And it's interesting because we see video games trying to find their space in the cloud.

1257
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:59,220
And now we see the cloud success story in the movie department anyway, trying to find

1258
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,420
its place in the cloud.

1259
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:06,340
And I feel like that is not going so smoothly, but acquisitions like this will probably help

1260
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,460
move them in the right direction.

1261
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,460
So we'll see.

1262
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:14,900
It's certainly interesting that this is the path that they're choosing to go as opposed

1263
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:19,700
to expanding, you know, organically their own numbers.

1264
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:24,020
Stu and Hunter Matt in chat says, I wonder what the next three years will look like when

1265
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,060
Netflix games.

1266
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,620
I wonder what the next three years are going to look like for the service.

1267
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:32,500
They've been losing a lot of stuff, but they still manage to keep a lot of shows that people

1268
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,060
are talking about.

1269
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:35,380
Like what Bridgerton is kind of the big thing right now.

1270
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:38,900
So a Stranger Things will be back at some point, which even I like that one.

1271
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,500
So I don't watch a lot of TV.

1272
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,620
I'll watch that.

1273
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:45,140
So maybe they do have some things still going for it.

1274
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,700
Pretty good.

1275
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:47,880
All right.

1276
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,260
I have a question for you.

1277
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,620
I have a question for you.

1278
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:52,360
So.

1279
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:53,800
All right.

1280
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,460
I'm still, I don't know.

1281
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,300
I get a little bit irritated thinking about it.

1282
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:00,440
How so?

1283
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:12,420
Just in general, I would really, I think that, I just think that they're coming in too late

1284
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:16,420
to a game, to a game, huh?

1285
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:19,860
That's been pioneered by people who are better prepared for it.

1286
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:27,540
I think that, and to kind of bring things back full circle, the top of the show, I think

1287
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:31,940
that's a lot of concern people have about Sony and that game pass model is that they're

1288
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:35,140
showing up late to a party that they should have been at a long time ago.

1289
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:36,740
But I don't know.

1290
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,100
This isn't fashionably late.

1291
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,980
This is, oh, you're cleaning up the cheese dip.

1292
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:41,480
I'm sorry.

1293
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,980
But Bobby does make a point in chat.

1294
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,420
It's not always about who's first.

1295
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,540
It's about who does it the best.

1296
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,140
That's certainly the case when it comes to a lot of stuff.

1297
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,260
So we'll see.

1298
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:55,940
I just don't know if Netflix has, I don't know.

1299
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,940
I feel like Netflix should stick at what they're good at.

1300
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:01,140
And that's original programming and canceling shows before their prime.

1301
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:07,380
But anyway, all right, let's move on.

1302
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:07,880
Logie.

1303
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,260
So this is kind of interesting.

1304
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:20,900
There's been some folks, Harbor Masters, who are developers that designed a kind of a weird

1305
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,100
like shell that plays Ocarina of Time on PC.

1306
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:30,580
So basically, they're trying to get around a takedown notice from Nintendo.

1307
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:36,820
So what they've done is they basically fans have reverse engineered the code from Ocarina

1308
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:37,700
of Time and to see.

1309
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:41,300
And so they've been able to port it to the PC.

1310
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,700
But in order to play this, you actually have to have us.

1311
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:48,580
It reads the code from a separate ROM file to kind of think of almost like a ROM patch

1312
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,900
or something like that, except it's not actually patching the ROM.

1313
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,140
It's just reading the ROM separately.

1314
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:59,220
I guess I'd almost be like an emulator, but you can't include the BIOS or codes because

1315
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,980
that's what's copyrighted type of thing.

1316
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:02,260
I don't know.

1317
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:06,740
But anyway, so now Ocarina of Time is available to play on PC, assuming you have the ROM

1318
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:13,380
ROM, and it supports different mods as well, including like HD models, texture packs, online

1319
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:16,100
play, Linux and Mac support, stuff like that.

1320
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,300
Ultra wide, if you want to do that.

1321
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:24,500
This is fascinating to me that this hasn't been yanked by Nintendo somehow yet.

1322
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:28,820
And the way that I mean, yes, I completely heard what you said about how it works and

1323
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:33,300
the fact that like it doesn't actually have a ROM in it so that there's no actual assets

1324
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:33,940
in it.

1325
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:36,660
Although wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

1326
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,380
People know before people know where to find them.

1327
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:44,900
You know, it's just it's just interesting that it creates a legal quandary for Nintendo

1328
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,660
as to can they shut it down?

1329
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:48,980
I will try.

1330
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:50,660
They're probably going to try.

1331
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:54,580
They're going to have to do it anyways, because they're a big company.

1332
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,220
And if it's a small individual, what are they going to do?

1333
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,300
Counter Sue all the money to do that.

1334
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,740
Nintendo is a big company.

1335
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:03,460
Plus, the problem is right before now it's on the Internet.

1336
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,700
You know, and that's at the end of the day, it's on the Internet.

1337
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:06,900
It's always going to be on the Internet.

1338
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:11,940
When I was looking into this before, apparently you also have to have a particular version

1339
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:19,700
of it where it's before it's pre Master Quest mode and also that it has to have a certain

1340
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,500
debug version.

1341
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,140
For some of the the current stuff to run on it.

1342
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:25,860
Interesting.

1343
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:29,940
I wonder, I bet here's here's the thing I'd be worried about, because I bet there's a

1344
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:31,860
lot of people interested in streaming this.

1345
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:35,780
I bet Nintendo yanks the shit out of those YouTube.

1346
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,380
I don't know if they can stop Twitch.

1347
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,500
It's a lot harder.

1348
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,460
They could probably find a way.

1349
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,940
I bet Nintendo starts yanking the shit out of those YouTubes.

1350
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,260
We've seen them do that kind of thing before.

1351
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:46,420
I'd be very curious to see.

1352
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:51,380
So but I think but the idea is so cool.

1353
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,860
Like I like that all that stuff aside.

1354
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:58,260
I'm like, wow, playing Ocarina of Time, like on a widescreen monitor on the computer is

1355
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:59,620
like, oh, I love that.

1356
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:06,340
Like I it just it just makes you go, gosh, if only Nintendo could do this themselves

1357
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:13,540
for their beloved games, but they don't want to take a clue from the stuff that Valve was

1358
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:19,540
doing before in hiring the people who are making these these things to bring out what

1359
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:24,020
what people actually want, you know, say, oh, these are talented people.

1360
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:26,020
They're already making this happen.

1361
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,900
Let's pay them to make it happen and give people what they want.

1362
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:31,380
I'm going to agree with that.

1363
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:36,660
I mean, I understand, you know, Nintendo being a Japanese company, probably the culture's

1364
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:37,700
a little different.

1365
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:41,220
And but I mean, at the end of the day, good business is good business.

1366
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,300
And I think Valve built their business on that.

1367
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,220
And that's why they're as successful as they are.

1368
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,180
So now if only they could count to three.

1369
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,360
Fair.

1370
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:51,880
All right.

1371
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:56,020
Well, speaking of Nintendo, lol, just Nintendo things.

1372
01:13:56,660 --> 01:14:04,020
Let's talk about the latest update for the switch, because there was a system software

1373
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:06,100
upgrade firmware for the switch.

1374
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:14,740
And it's now up to version 14.0, if you can believe it, which adds groups to the home

1375
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,240
page.

1376
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,060
It's a folder system.

1377
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:23,540
So finally, you have a way to build folders, excuse me, groups out of all of the games

1378
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:27,300
that you've accumulated on your screen, because most of you probably have so much stuff on

1379
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:27,780
your switch.

1380
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:32,020
Now, it doesn't fit just on one bar, you have to go to that screen where you're looking

1381
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,020
at everything on there.

1382
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:40,500
So yeah, so it's led to a lot of people commenting the lol folders late to the party.

1383
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,780
But then at the same time, a lot of people are like, but I'm using it.

1384
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:46,420
And like I organized all my games and all that stuff.

1385
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:50,820
So you can make up to 100 groups and you can have up to 200 titles per group.

1386
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,260
I can't imagine anyone's going to actually hit that number without them intentionally

1387
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:54,660
trying.

1388
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:03,620
Also, you can only see the all software screen if you have more than 13 software icons.

1389
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:04,820
I find that interesting.

1390
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,580
I wonder why they changed that, but okay.

1391
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,340
Also, they've updated Bluetooth audio.

1392
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:16,740
You can adjust the volume of Bluetooth audio using either the switch console or your Bluetooth

1393
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:17,620
audio device.

1394
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:18,820
Woohoo for that.

1395
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:23,460
So that's the big Nintendo system update.

1396
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:30,420
And let's see, looking in chat, Mike Def says, For fuck's sake, the Wii U does folders

1397
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:30,820
better.

1398
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:36,260
Sj100Matt says, We got folder and two choices of colors and themes.

1399
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:40,020
Mike Def says, It's something at least, but it should have been better.

1400
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,860
And Orange Right says, Better late than never.

1401
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:48,980
I mean, can't Nintendo just change the look of the I mean, they would never do it.

1402
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:52,340
I'm like, can't they just, like, really overhaul the look at the switch interface,

1403
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,780
but they would never do it.

1404
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:57,140
Only Microsoft does things that are that nutty.

1405
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:02,420
Like, if you think about the 360 and, like, the radical changes the 360 interface went

1406
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:04,980
through, remember the blades, the initial interface?

1407
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:05,940
It wasn't that bad.

1408
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:08,420
I mean, for its time, it wasn't that bad.

1409
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:10,580
And then they, like, completely redid it.

1410
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:14,260
It looked like a new console when they redid it around the time Kinect came out.

1411
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:15,700
Something else.

1412
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:17,700
All right.

1413
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:24,660
Anyway, let's go back to a simpler time when we weren't so concerned with the interfaces

1414
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,900
on the system, because there wasn't any.

1415
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,740
You would plug in your cartridge and go.

1416
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,420
Not this one.

1417
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:31,380
You've been listening.

1418
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:32,260
Not that one.

1419
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,060
Not that button.

1420
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,300
That's the wrong button.

1421
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:36,660
That's the button that ends the show.

1422
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:38,580
Let's try.

1423
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:39,060
Game over.

1424
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:39,380
Bye.

1425
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:42,340
Let's try this button instead.

1426
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:58,580
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1427
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,900
out a classic and tell you about it.

1428
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,540
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1429
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:10,340
And yes, DarkSakura, like you were saying, this isn't really a pick tonight that is about

1430
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,220
an old system.

1431
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:17,540
In fact, this is one of those picks where I'm going, this is 10 years old.

1432
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:18,260
It's honest.

1433
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:19,220
It's 10 years old.

1434
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,180
Really?

1435
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:21,940
I can't handle it.

1436
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:22,500
What did you pick?

1437
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,580
I picked Mass Effect 3.

1438
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:26,820
Now we've done them all.

1439
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:34,500
It is almost exactly, almost exactly 10 years.

1440
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:40,980
Well, I meant I would have been doing it closer to the 10 year mark, but so it came out on

1441
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,980
March 6, 2012.

1442
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:50,580
And it's a action RPG developed by Bioware published by Electronic Arts and it is the

1443
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,780
third in the Mass Effect original trilogy.

1444
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:59,700
It's the final one in that it was released for Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

1445
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,180
PlayStation, PlayStation 3.

1446
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:08,740
There was a Wii U version entitled Mass Effect 3 Special Edition released in November, 2012.

1447
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:16,020
So the game is set in the Milky Way Galaxy in 2186 and the Reapers are coming.

1448
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,580
And this time the Reapers came.

1449
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,820
And this time the Reapers came.

1450
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:22,820
You opened the box.

1451
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:24,660
Sorry, wrong game.

1452
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:30,900
Anyway, you can import your save file from Mass Effect 2 and keep going.

1453
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:40,660
It also, instead of some of the previous things that went into Mass Effect 2, this one has

1454
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:45,860
a lot more involved increasing your military strength by completing your missions, gathering

1455
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:46,660
your resources.

1456
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:51,540
And it does have, though, much of the similar gameplay from Mass Effect 2.

1457
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:54,820
Both of those were changed from the first Mass Effect.

1458
01:18:56,660 --> 01:19:00,820
You know, you got your cover based shooting and the altered person, things like that.

1459
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:04,580
The multiplayer component, I miss it.

1460
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:08,020
I miss Mass Effect multiplayer so much.

1461
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,540
We did a lot of that, Rob.

1462
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:12,200
Remember?

1463
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:14,660
Okay, Rob's gone.

1464
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:25,300
Anyway, it also had a bunch of DLC and some of the DLC was, like, significantly epic.

1465
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:32,420
So at any rate, yeah, and Questbuster, I agree.

1466
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:34,980
Garris has never left my team because Garris.

1467
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:37,300
The voice.

1468
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:41,380
So moving into a little bit more about it.

1469
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:47,700
So, like I said, you can import your game file for Mass Effect 2.

1470
01:19:48,420 --> 01:20:01,220
You can go on the Galaxy map and choose where you're going to go.

1471
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:02,420
You've got different quests.

1472
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,460
You have side quests.

1473
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:10,420
You have different paths on a tree that you can unlock your skills.

1474
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:19,780
You also have your biotic powers, which are going to be more like telekinesis and shields

1475
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:22,100
and things like that, as long as tech powers as well.

1476
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:35,060
And then there was also an app that you had that you could also contribute to your Galaxy

1477
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:35,620
readiness.

1478
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,100
Oh, my God.

1479
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,060
I forgot about that.

1480
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:37,780
That was annoying.

1481
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:42,980
And I brought up earlier about multiplayer.

1482
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:47,460
So I'll get back to that in a moment, because I was saying that we played a lot of multiplayer.

1483
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,340
I love multiplayer, but continue.

1484
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:56,500
Yeah, but at any rate, so you've got different modes.

1485
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,060
You have, like, action story and RPG.

1486
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:02,980
So in action mode, your conversations are all just generic replies.

1487
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:08,260
Story mode, you have manual replies and minimal combat.

1488
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:12,100
RPG mode, you have manual replies and normal combat.

1489
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:15,540
I always just played in story mode because that's why I was playing this for the story.

1490
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:23,140
At any rate, the combat is actually pretty good.

1491
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:28,740
It's real time, but you can sort of have a pause to change your menu or move things around.

1492
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:34,180
You are always playing as Commander Shepard, although Fem Ship is best ship.

1493
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,980
And you can go into cover and play with different play styles.

1494
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:41,940
You can melee, you can use biotics, all of that.

1495
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:44,900
Now multiplayer multiplayer was the best.

1496
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,620
It was so good.

1497
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:52,900
It was called Galaxy at War, and you could have up to four players to do Horde style

1498
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,020
cooperative matches.

1499
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:59,540
And you could also get in-game currency to unlock different items.

1500
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:07,220
You know, I guess loot packs, you know, they did have the in-game transactions, but you

1501
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,180
didn't need them.

1502
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:10,020
It wasn't entirely reliant on them.

1503
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:16,180
And then you could also do, for the first year, there were BioWare sponsored challenges

1504
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:19,300
that had special objectives and increased rewards.

1505
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:27,300
And so this isn't accurate because, oh, never mind, never mind.

1506
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:32,900
You can play as all kinds of different sorts of races instead of just playing as Shepard.

1507
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:38,420
You remember I had my Krogan named Rex in effect after the band?

1508
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:42,660
Sorry, I was muted.

1509
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:43,160
Yeah.

1510
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:48,100
And then my Quarian engineer was who I pretty much played all the time.

1511
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:53,460
But it was just really great.

1512
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:56,020
And he had fantastic voice acting in it.

1513
01:22:56,660 --> 01:23:01,700
You had, you know, Mark Mirren, Jennifer Hale, both amazing.

1514
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:05,860
You had Kimberly Brooks's Ashley Williams.

1515
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,300
I love listening to her voice.

1516
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:12,580
And Freddie Prinze Jr. as Vega.

1517
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:15,140
He was great.

1518
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:18,580
I absolutely loved having him in there.

1519
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:23,780
Of course, you had Seth Green as Joker, Martin Sheen as the Elusive Man.

1520
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:30,180
Aria was Carrie-Anne Moss, just, ugh, what a goddess.

1521
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:32,820
You had Garrus, great voice.

1522
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:39,700
But, I mean, they were just like such a good, oh, and Lance Henriksen as Admiral Hackett,

1523
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:42,820
like really just amazing voice actors.

1524
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:50,340
So anyway, moving forward, as to the development of the game,

1525
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:59,060
the co-lead writer for Mass Effect 2, Mac Walters, was lead writer for Mass Effect 3.

1526
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:06,580
And they just began a short story that went over the major plot points and then moved

1527
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:07,620
high level for there.

1528
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:12,660
And then, you know, they just sort of worked through it very organically from what I'm

1529
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:13,380
seeing on here.

1530
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:20,100
And then they had the different ending sequences that, with the Reapers, they had a lot more

1531
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:21,060
than what we got.

1532
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:30,820
In fact, there was an idea that would have had a Shepard who had been converted by Reaper

1533
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:42,580
Shepard who had been converted by Reaper Tech, or that Saren would have, who was the first

1534
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:49,380
antagonist of the first Mass Effect, would have come back or something, or they would

1535
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,980
have actually were having Shepard mimic Saren's story.

1536
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:56,180
The Elusive Man was supposed to be a boss.

1537
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:56,820
Did you know that?

1538
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:59,700
I remember hearing that, yeah.

1539
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,380
Which always surprised me he wasn't.

1540
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:06,420
There's actually artwork of it, because I have it in one of the Mass Effect art books

1541
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:11,380
that he was going to turn into this massive Reaper creature, but they scrapped that.

1542
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:18,260
There is some dialogue I think is still in the code that was supposed to refer to that.

1543
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:26,260
They had other ones about dark energy, that the Entropic Effect would end the universe.

1544
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:29,300
So they had other things like that.

1545
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:36,020
And then in November 2011, a private beta of Mass Effect 3 was leaked onto Xbox Live.

1546
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:43,060
And so there were plot points that people were able to access, and it made, it forced

1547
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:44,980
BioWare to change some of the story.

1548
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:52,980
So it was originally designed for consoles that were heading to the end of their lifespans,

1549
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:58,980
and so they worked to optimize the gameplay rather than push the technology ahead.

1550
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:08,420
And then there were of course all the DLC that came out, but I'm going to actually take

1551
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:10,020
a step back and talk about the music.

1552
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:20,020
The music for Mass Effect 2 was a lot more orchestral, where for Mass Effect 3 is a lot

1553
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:29,860
more synthesizer driven, and it ended up being the more likely choice for something

1554
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:33,540
where you're heading into this perhaps technological takeover.

1555
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:42,020
And they did bring back fonts, I think, for the end song for that one, that did the end

1556
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,540
song at the first Mass Effect.

1557
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:45,780
This one's one of their, they're a prog rock band.

1558
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:55,540
But also moving forward, it was very heavily marketed, it was very, very looked forward

1559
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:55,700
to.

1560
01:26:55,700 --> 01:27:00,900
They also used viral marketing with fictional blogs and a web series called BioWare Pulse.

1561
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:07,860
There were early copies of Mass Effect 3 that were launched into space using weather balloons

1562
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:13,860
and equipped with GPS devices, and fans could track them and recover them when they landed,

1563
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:15,620
which gave them early copies of the game.

1564
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:21,220
There were so many, there were just like that one leak that happened before.

1565
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:32,500
And it actually, this time they promoted the male and female Shepard because FemShep has

1566
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,580
fans, and she was there first.

1567
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:39,140
And then they did another one where you could decide what she looks like, and I'm sorry,

1568
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,380
I did not care for her face model.

1569
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,300
It was not based on a human.

1570
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:47,220
But hacking's gonna hack.

1571
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:52,660
There were mod editors that you could take that makeup look and apply it to a normal

1572
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:54,900
shape of face and just do all kinds of different stuff for it.

1573
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:06,180
You also had different goodies for pre-orders, such as PSN ones were given the M55 Argus

1574
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,220
assault weapon and a Mass Effect 3 PlayStation theme.

1575
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:14,740
The release was scheduled for late 2011, but it was moved to March 6, 2012.

1576
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:19,380
It was only released for Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

1577
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:26,100
But then as it came out, there was Mass Effect 3 also, by the way, required Origin to play

1578
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:26,820
on PC.

1579
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:29,140
There's the Wii U version that came out.

1580
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:33,620
And then since then, we've had the remaster, which is Mass Effect Legendary Edition that

1581
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:43,300
came for Windows, PS4, and Xbox One, of which I can only play two and three on my Windows

1582
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:44,580
11 ARM partition.

1583
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:51,780
For some reason, it cannot emulate the architecture for Mass Effect 1 to run properly in it.

1584
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:55,940
So anyone who's on ARM-based machines, I'm going to warn you.

1585
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,300
So there was DLC, and there was great DLC.

1586
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,660
So the first one was okay.

1587
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:05,780
Oh, and by the way, by the way, let's rewind back.

1588
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:06,740
Actually, we're not going to do it.

1589
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:07,700
We're going to talk about it at the end.

1590
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:14,020
You had From Ashes, where you get Javik as a squad mate, and he was absolutely hilarious.

1591
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:18,100
You had Leviathan that went into the Reaper's Origins.

1592
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:27,140
You had Omega, which was taking Omega back for Aria.

1593
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:31,460
And of course, that's the one that gave us our first female turian.

1594
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:35,380
And then Citadel, which was...

1595
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:41,700
Citadel was like, hi, we've read your fan fiction, pretty much.

1596
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:49,460
I also liked, I don't know if you got this, but the place that the condo that Shepard

1597
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,380
was left was called Tiberius Towers.

1598
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:56,660
And Tiberius was the middle name of Captain Kirk.

1599
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:57,160
Yep.

1600
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:03,220
There's also an interactive comic called Genesis 2 that you could play and customize

1601
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:07,700
for just quick setting up your story if you didn't have a game go through.

1602
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:13,540
But Citadel was just, it was a trip.

1603
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:14,100
It was great.

1604
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:18,180
You know that you can actually still buy the, do you say, sushi plate set?

1605
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:24,020
Do you say it was the restaurant where the Citadel thing starts going down?

1606
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:29,220
Anyway, let's talk about the response.

1607
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:33,620
So gameplay got a lot of praise.

1608
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:36,420
It was decided to be really, really good.

1609
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:42,100
There were some bugs, but for the most part, the characters made up for the flaws.

1610
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:44,820
The voice acting was top notch.

1611
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,740
The music was great.

1612
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:58,260
Everything overall that went into the game was pretty well received, except the endings.

1613
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:09,300
So the endings for Mass Effect 3 was, no one liked it and by no one I mean most of the

1614
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,100
internet.

1615
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:15,700
And so there was an internet campaign called Retake Mass Effect to demand better ending

1616
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:16,260
to the game.

1617
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:20,180
And part of that included a charity drive for Child's Play.

1618
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,140
So some good from that.

1619
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:28,900
The public outcry basically even had responses from the Better Business Bureau and Federal

1620
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:33,940
Trade Commission and the advertising standards authority to whether or not BioWare had engaged

1621
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:36,260
in false advertising and misled the customers.

1622
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:45,060
So on April 5th, 2012, BioWare announced a free DLC pack that would expand upon the ending

1623
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:46,500
and address the criticism.

1624
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:52,100
And it was called the Extended Cut that did come out on June 26, 2012.

1625
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:53,300
And it was a mixed bag.

1626
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:58,020
Honestly, I'm fine with it.

1627
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:01,780
I love Extended Cut, but the original ending never bothered me so much.

1628
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:05,060
It wasn't great, but some movies have bad endings.

1629
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:07,220
I always thought this was way...

1630
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,820
That's why I can't stand the mist.

1631
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:10,100
Yeah, I always thought this...

1632
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:11,540
It could have just kept it like the book.

1633
01:32:11,540 --> 01:32:12,980
Blown way out of proportion.

1634
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:23,620
Well, there were other issues like the conflict of interest issue for having Jessica Chobot

1635
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:25,380
as Diana Allers.

1636
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:26,740
Oh, yeah.

1637
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:32,100
And then some people were all like...

1638
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:38,820
They didn't like the same sex aspect to relationships for Shepard.

1639
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:43,700
And then they also didn't like that there were some characters who weren't available

1640
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:46,740
for that, because I mean, let's just face it, everyone wants to romance Garris.

1641
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:55,300
But at any rate, it originally shipped 3.5 million units in the first month.

1642
01:32:55,300 --> 01:33:01,060
It sold 349,000 digital copies by the end of March alone.

1643
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:09,060
The game sold over 890,000 copies in its first 24 hours.

1644
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:15,540
And according to MPD Group, it sold 1.3 million physical copies in the first month,

1645
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:20,580
which was twice the total of Mass Effect 2 during its opening month in January 2010.

1646
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:29,300
And in May 2012, EA reported that Mass Effect 3 grossed over 200 million during quarter 4 FY12.

1647
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:33,060
So that's financial year for people who don't know.

1648
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:37,140
And as far as accolades, it got a number of awards.

1649
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:42,180
The Satellite Award for Outstanding Role Playing Game, Best RPG at the Spike Video Game Awards,

1650
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:47,620
Game of the Year from Game Informer, Best Overall RPG from IGN, Best Cooperative Multiplayer,

1651
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:50,420
Best Game Cinematography from Inside Gaming Awards.

1652
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:56,660
But basically, the legacy left by Mass Effect 3,

1653
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:01,780
it's really the one where we talk about entitled gamers.

1654
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:04,260
We don't like the end, change it.

1655
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:13,140
You know, and it also bringing in, you know, like when Andromeda came out,

1656
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:18,260
they actually had some very racy scenes in there and were not shy at all about

1657
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:21,940
romance options, you know, which I think is great.

1658
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:24,900
I mean, Andromeda was questionable.

1659
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:32,100
But in fact, moving into Andromeda, it was a sequel to the first trilogy,

1660
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:38,820
but it takes place 634 years later because of

1661
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:48,020
word cryology, the time it takes.

1662
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:50,180
Cryogenic hibernation, that's what I'm thinking of.

1663
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:55,860
Or you play as either Sarah or Scott finding a new homeworld for humanity.

1664
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:06,180
And there's actually a Mass Effect universe game in development and pre-production at Bioware.

1665
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:08,980
So we're going to be getting something else.

1666
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:12,660
I just, I really, I really hope it's okay.

1667
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:22,900
But as far as those scores, like the Xbox 360 and PS3 copies got a 93 of 100 for Metacritic,

1668
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:25,620
PC got 89, Wii U got 85.

1669
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:30,740
But now I'm going to talk about another part of this, and that's the mods.

1670
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:35,940
My copy of Mass Effect 3 was modded to hell and back.

1671
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:44,580
The high-res mod, beautiful, custom hair, awesome, fly cam, fly cam was my favorite.

1672
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:48,420
And I had, if anyone remembers this, because it's still there,

1673
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:51,940
I had a Tumblr account called Mass Effecting.

1674
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:55,540
And it started with me making a stupid meme.

1675
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:57,940
I don't even remember.

1676
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:01,140
Oh yeah, it was a Vitturian with crossed eyes and it said Derpian.

1677
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:08,740
And from there that blog had over 10,000 followers by the time I had been running it for two years.

1678
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:13,780
I eventually gave up because I couldn't find any more, you know, good screenshots to use.

1679
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:21,780
But just showing, I mean, I basically created like a whole head Canon in that universe that

1680
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:28,100
people bought into, you know, but it just goes to show how big, you know, if my stupid Tumblr

1681
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:36,340
could get that many followers for weird memes, then the fanfiction world blew up.

1682
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:40,100
The fan merch world blew up, fan art blew up.

1683
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:46,740
I mean, now to the point where BioWare and the Yeti, I think is another one that sells

1684
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:52,020
some stuff, but like you can get official like Garris body pillows, you know, that type of thing.

1685
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:58,100
It's just, it's spawned such an amazing fandom that still thrives to this day.

1686
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:03,060
Maybe not as strong as it was, but it's still alive and kicking.

1687
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:08,660
You know, those of us who romanced certain characters, anytime that character brings,

1688
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:14,820
is brought up, we're like, oh yeah, we're like that with Dragon Age as well, but I digress.

1689
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:20,100
But yeah, it's Mass Effect 3.

1690
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:24,660
It's probably one of my favorite modern games.

1691
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:27,540
I would probably say it is my favorite modern game.

1692
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:29,560
All right.

1693
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:32,340
Yeah, there you go.

1694
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:33,140
There it is.

1695
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:36,340
Your classic game of the week, Mass Effect 3.

1696
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:40,660
I met so many friends through this game too, by the way.

1697
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:42,820
I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.

1698
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:46,740
I don't think the multiplayer got enough credit.

1699
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:51,460
You know, everybody bitched about the ending and so many people bitched about multiplayer too.

1700
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:55,380
And it's honestly one of the most enjoyable multiplayer experiences I've had in a game

1701
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:58,500
where like literally a lot of my friends are playing it.

1702
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,780
We did good things in it.

1703
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:01,460
It impacted your single player game.

1704
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:03,220
I just, it was so good.

1705
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:08,340
Like I, I wish they had done a standalone multiplayer game and still kind of wish they

1706
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:12,100
would just sort of bridge the gap between releases.

1707
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:14,740
Andromeda's multiplayer was even okay.

1708
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:15,860
It was different.

1709
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:18,580
I mean, but it was, it was okay.

1710
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:19,780
You know what I mean?

1711
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:20,980
Like, I don't know what else to say.

1712
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:21,480
It was okay.

1713
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:26,100
But I still wish there would be something to kind of like hold us over.

1714
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:26,500
I don't know.

1715
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:27,780
I miss it.

1716
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:31,060
Well, I'm glad they fixed a few things with Andromeda.

1717
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:32,740
I didn't think it was a bad game at all.

1718
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,660
I honestly enjoyed it.

1719
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:40,020
But, um, but I, and there's people who think that Mass Effect 2 is the pinnacle of the

1720
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:44,820
series, but honestly, I got a lot more out of the story for Mass Effect 3.

1721
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:51,540
I thought that there was, especially for those of us who, you know, romanced Garrus, there

1722
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:56,420
was a lot more payoff in it than just a head bump, you know?

1723
01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:04,420
But, but I'm actually looking at my mass affecting Tumblr and I forgot that I made

1724
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:05,780
some of these ridiculous things.

1725
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:08,100
All right.

1726
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:13,300
You got 10,000 followers on your Tumblr, but this podcast can seem to only get 10 listeners.

1727
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:18,020
Pint out our podcast on my Tumblr.

1728
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:18,520
I know.

1729
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:19,800
You know?

1730
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:20,840
All right.

1731
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:22,200
Anyway.

1732
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:23,700
All right.

1733
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:24,420
Well, there it is.

1734
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:27,300
Now Dark Soccer has done the entire trilogy.

1735
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:29,300
She can't pick a Mass Effect game ever again.

1736
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:31,140
Well, when Andromeda is 10 years old, I guess.

1737
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:32,900
When Andromeda is 10 years old, I sure can.

1738
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,100
Uh, all right.

1739
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:36,820
Let's miss you.

1740
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:38,180
Wait, let's move on.

1741
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:39,140
I guess I will.

1742
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:43,140
So I'll see you in 2026 or whatever that game turns 10.

1743
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:43,640
All right.

1744
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,140
Will you still be doing this?

1745
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:46,580
Who knows?

1746
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:47,080
All right.

1747
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:52,900
I mean, I'm pretty sure around episode nine, I was saying, can you imagine, or like we

1748
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,900
were doing the first year, even a hundred episodes.

1749
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:58,580
I was like, can you imagine if we were still doing this at a thousand episodes?

1750
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:01,460
And now it's like, wow, that might actually happen.

1751
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:01,940
All right.

1752
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:08,820
Anyway, I'm putting it in the chat, but everyone needs to look at this because this is my favorite

1753
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:11,380
one I've made for this little memes.

1754
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:11,620
All right.

1755
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:13,140
Well, we need to do rapid fire news.

1756
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:14,100
So you keep the show moving.

1757
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,220
Let's get to it.

1758
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:19,860
Rapid fire news and some other stories, uh, around the gaming industry.

1759
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:20,980
So Loki, we'll start with you.

1760
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:23,140
Yeah, I'm pretty excited.

1761
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:27,380
There's a brand new Lego game coming out called Lego brick tales.

1762
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:32,260
And it's a little bit different than your typical Lego game by like traveler tales or

1763
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:32,760
something like that.

1764
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:39,380
Um, so this one is a physics based puzzle game.

1765
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:45,860
So it kind of reminds me a little bit of besieged, or I guess a little bit like Kerbell's

1766
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:52,980
space program where you have to build different devices out of Lego and they react to the

1767
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:53,220
physics.

1768
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:56,820
So like they have like, you know, a helicopter that you build or something like that, and

1769
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:58,260
you have to solve puzzles with it.

1770
01:40:58,260 --> 01:40:59,620
So that sounds pretty cool.

1771
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:02,740
And that's supposed to be releasing sometime this year.

1772
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:04,980
So we'll have to look forward to that.

1773
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:13,540
And then, uh, there is a silly game coming out by the folks that did the, uh, bloodborne

1774
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:16,340
demake like for PlayStation one.

1775
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:20,580
Now they're taking those models that they made for the demake and they're making bloodborne

1776
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:22,580
cart, a goat cart game.

1777
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:26,980
So I guess we'll have to wait and see with it.

1778
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:27,780
Cause it's funny.

1779
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:29,860
Yeah, no, I think it's funny too.

1780
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:33,940
I wonder if it'll be as punishing of a cart game as those.

1781
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:39,940
That would be funny if it was like a, like the ultimately punishing difficult like cart

1782
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:40,260
game.

1783
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:42,900
Uh, I would, I would think that was funny.

1784
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:46,020
I probably wouldn't play it very long, but I think it was funny for the five minutes

1785
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:46,500
I play it.

1786
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:47,460
So, yeah.

1787
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:48,340
All right.

1788
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:49,700
Um, let's see.

1789
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:50,580
How about dark Sakura?

1790
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:54,500
I had to unmute.

1791
01:41:54,500 --> 01:42:02,260
So there is, there are, you know, uh, NFT games out there and basically all they are

1792
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:10,980
is just to sell the NFTs, you know, but someone's actually making a game called alluvium that

1793
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:18,180
is supposed to be pretty much up there with, with any good game, um, where you can earn

1794
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:19,780
your NFTs in game.

1795
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:25,220
Um, or you can purchase them or do exchanges with other people, but the fact that you can

1796
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:30,900
get them in game makes it a little bit less cringey.

1797
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:40,580
Um, but at any rate, um, the, uh, it's, it's the, the currency for it though is based on

1798
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:49,220
Ethereum, but at any rate, uh, the game is where you have different robot helpers that

1799
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:54,260
go with you and you have to explore the planet and you meet different creatures that you

1800
01:42:54,260 --> 01:43:00,260
battle with and your little robot friends, you know, are kind of your, your battler.

1801
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:03,620
You also have to look at the synergy with your armor and all this other stuff.

1802
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:07,620
And it actually looks like it's fairly complicated, uh, gameplay.

1803
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:15,380
Um, but you can buy the, the native token with, uh, Binance, Qcoin, Poloniex, Gate.io,

1804
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:24,020
other exchanges, um, for people who are into crypto and, and NFTs, I guess this would be

1805
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:26,740
a good RPG.

1806
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:29,220
And actually I've watched the, the trailer for it.

1807
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:30,900
It actually kind of looks fun.

1808
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:35,460
Um, they're focusing on marketing and promotion right now.

1809
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:43,220
It's just that I hope that this doesn't set a, a trend for other games to come out like

1810
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:47,380
it and to encourage these other companies to start dealing in NFT.

1811
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:48,180
Oh, well too late.

1812
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:53,940
They're everybody's I mean, I know I totally do, but I already, everybody's asking how

1813
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:54,980
can we cash in on this?

1814
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:55,700
I'm sorry.

1815
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:59,140
Until NFTs don't feel like I'm participating in crime.

1816
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:02,260
Um, I, I'm not interested in them.

1817
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:07,460
Like I, I'm just, I just, I just, I'm sick of it being shoved into my face.

1818
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:11,460
Like I need to accept these NFTs and, and this is where it's going.

1819
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:16,100
Cause all the cool kids say it's going to FTS like prove it.

1820
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:18,740
Like if it's that valuable, it'll stand out on its own.

1821
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:22,900
But it's like you even whisper the letters NFT on Twitter and you're going to have bought

1822
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:27,300
accounts up your asshole trying to sell things that like you just have no interest in.

1823
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:31,060
And let's also talk about how ugly most of the NFTs that are available are.

1824
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:33,940
Like a lot of those procedurally generated things and stuff.

1825
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:34,820
It's stupid.

1826
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:40,820
Now I will go out on a limb and say this one actually looks pretty good.

1827
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:41,060
Yeah.

1828
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:47,620
Now if a good game comes out, because again, a good game is a good game and it manages

1829
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:52,500
to leverage NFTs in a way where again, it doesn't feel like I'm participating in crime.

1830
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:55,860
I'll have a more open mind about it, but.

1831
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:59,220
And this one, by the way, is running in Unreal five.

1832
01:45:00,180 --> 01:45:00,680
Interesting.

1833
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:02,420
Yeah.

1834
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,540
It's interesting.

1835
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:04,580
I mean, that's it.

1836
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:13,140
It's if, if this is a way that NFT actually is going to work in a.

1837
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:19,300
I want to say ethical way.

1838
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:20,980
No, I get it.

1839
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:21,460
I get it.

1840
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:28,980
Then I'm okay with something like this, especially if the fact that you can have a chance to

1841
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:34,740
get the more valuable items in game and then trade around and move them up.

1842
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:37,220
You know, for me, that's like playing, you know, playing magic.

1843
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:38,440
Yeah.

1844
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:43,620
You know, you would get your rare cards out of your, out of your packs and then trade

1845
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:45,060
them around to your friends.

1846
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:46,180
And I mean, that's.

1847
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:51,460
Without, you know, all of the crypto aspect of it, that's essentially what NFTs are.

1848
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:55,700
Um, a set in chat says the MLM of investing.

1849
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:59,220
I, I, yeah, that's what NFTs certainly feel like.

1850
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:03,700
But when, you know, speaking of MLMs, I'll still buy Tupperware at target.

1851
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:09,220
So if there's a way to buy old Tupperware, if there's a, yeah, or old Tupperware at a

1852
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:18,100
thrift store, if there's a way to make it feel less slimy and unnecessary, then I think

1853
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:22,420
that's finally how people will crack the code on making the masses accept NFTs.

1854
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:25,300
Cause right now it feels like, it feels like a crime family.

1855
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:25,940
It really does.

1856
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:28,260
So we'll see.

1857
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:39,300
Uh, the other news, um, the Mario 64 guidebook scans were required to be taken down.

1858
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:46,100
Um, they were, were all online with different 3d models for each of the levels and everything.

1859
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:52,220
And, uh, they were required, uh, the uploader who's Dave, uh,

1860
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:55,540
shoveling of comfort food, video games to, to take down.

1861
01:46:56,260 --> 01:47:01,140
And they challenged copyright and said, we don't, we don't want it anymore.

1862
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:03,780
So they have to acquiesce.

1863
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:09,620
I mean, they're really, really just tapping down on it and it's disgusting.

1864
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:09,860
Yeah.

1865
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:11,860
I mean, like I understand.

1866
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:20,660
Piracy of scanned books is a crappy thing, but Mario essentials got taken down.

1867
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:21,620
Yeah.

1868
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:23,860
Mario 64 is also how old of a game.

1869
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:27,860
And there comes a certain point where again, I think it's about preserving certain types

1870
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:28,900
of media.

1871
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:33,940
It's not like you can walk into a library and find a copy of this strategy guide or

1872
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:38,740
find it through any sort of legitimate, at least first party means you might luck into

1873
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:43,300
one at a garage sale, but how often is that or use bookstore, but how often is that going

1874
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:44,100
to happen?

1875
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:49,300
So I feel like these scans were a way to kind of preserve something that really wasn't,

1876
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:51,860
let's it wasn't making Nintendo money.

1877
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:55,940
And I, I, I'm sure there'll be people that are like, well, Nintendo has to defend their

1878
01:47:55,940 --> 01:47:56,420
trademarks.

1879
01:47:56,420 --> 01:48:01,300
So there's a certain line.

1880
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:05,060
Nintendo keeps crossing that nobody else in the game industry feels like they need to

1881
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:05,380
cross.

1882
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:10,580
There, there should be a statute of limitations that applies to that.

1883
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:12,580
Like, like with music or, or something.

1884
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:16,020
Or even the hardware.

1885
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:20,260
Cause you know, Nintendo hardware, third parties just make straight up Nintendo systems and

1886
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:26,340
now super Nintendo systems, they can't be stopped because those trademarks do expire

1887
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:28,260
after 30 years or something like that.

1888
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:32,500
So that's why you have all of a sudden, all these other, like the retron five and stuff

1889
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:39,220
that literally just play the carts because the, the ability for Nintendo to have the

1890
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:43,220
market on that runs out after so many years, which is interesting.

1891
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:51,620
Anyway, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and we'll start

1892
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:52,900
with the U S and Loki.

1893
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:54,260
Yep.

1894
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:56,340
Not a whole lot coming out over here.

1895
01:48:56,340 --> 01:49:00,580
We've got Crusader Kings three on PlayStation five and Xbox series.

1896
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:08,020
Uh, Chris star on Tendo switch, death stranding director's cut on PC.

1897
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:17,860
Moss book two on PlayStation four and the weird West on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox

1898
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:18,180
one.

1899
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:24,420
Looking at Japan, uh, we have a few releases on the Nintendo switch this week.

1900
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:30,980
We have Barry Shauna, uh, Senza, Ishigu no Kaze in a regular and limited edition.

1901
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:33,620
There's also a twin pack coming out for all that.

1902
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:39,700
A game called kiss trilogy is coming out as well, uh, which is includes the games hotch

1903
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:42,340
kiss, kiss bell and kiss auto.

1904
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:49,460
Um, they look like dating Sims and it's, um, women of a questionable age in swimsuits on

1905
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:50,660
the cover hand drawn.

1906
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:52,100
So it's, it's that kind of game.

1907
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:58,660
Uh, we also have in Japan on the switch, uh, Hokago Cinderella is out in a regular and

1908
01:49:58,660 --> 01:49:59,940
a limited edition.

1909
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:07,060
And, uh, that's it for the switch, but looking at the PlayStation five, uh, it's a dry week.

1910
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:09,460
We don't have a release there until the 1st of April.

1911
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:12,020
So, uh, no way, which I guess is this week, isn't it?

1912
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:15,060
So I will mention, uh, what was it?

1913
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:15,540
There it is.

1914
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:18,580
MLB the show is out in Japan this week.

1915
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:21,860
It's out in English, but, uh, it is still getting a regional release in Japan.

1916
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:23,380
Very popular over there.

1917
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:25,940
It sure is a dark soccer.

1918
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:26,500
How about Europe?

1919
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:34,580
So on the 29th, we have in nightmare for a PlayStation crusader Kings three for PlayStation

1920
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:41,220
and X-Box on the 31st, we have grand mountain venture wonderlands for switch.

1921
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:46,820
And then for PlayStation and X-Box, we have Tropico six, uh, next gen edition from it

1922
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:47,220
looks like.

1923
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:50,420
And then on April 1st, we have doki doki literature club.

1924
01:50:50,420 --> 01:50:57,940
Plus, all right, well, let's do some more news stories and then we'll get to emails

1925
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:02,260
any calls that might want to come in tonight and all that other good stuff in our round

1926
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:02,740
table.

1927
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:04,900
But first, a few more headlines starting with Loki.

1928
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:06,580
Yeah.

1929
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:14,740
So rockstar has decided to go ahead and offer a subscription service now to grand theft

1930
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:17,620
auto online called GTA plus.

1931
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:26,180
It is going to cost $6 a month and they give you in game money as well as some other perks

1932
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:31,780
along with that, mostly in game items and like properties and stuff like that.

1933
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:35,300
But this is coming right after that.

1934
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:43,060
They've decided to, um, basically sell the upgrade for grand theft auto five, um, and

1935
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:45,700
online they're offering it now for like 40 bucks right now.

1936
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:49,380
Grand theft auto online is actually free on PlayStation, I believe.

1937
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:52,900
Um, but they're going to charge for that later on as well.

1938
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:57,860
And it's just, it's, it's just another cash grab.

1939
01:51:57,860 --> 01:52:00,180
It's like subscribing to their shark cards.

1940
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:06,500
And I think it's just terrible, but yeah, I saw, I saw your tweet tweet about it.

1941
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:10,020
Like you definitely have some strong opinions, but I know it's just like, well, it's just

1942
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:11,860
like, I just kind of given up on it.

1943
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:13,780
It's like, what, what, what happened to you guys?

1944
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:18,660
Like, seriously, like you used to be a company and make fun of companies like this, and now

1945
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:21,380
you're just, just milking it.

1946
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:23,300
Like this game is so old now.

1947
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:27,700
We're almost classic game of the week time on this game because it's been out for so

1948
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:27,940
long.

1949
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:32,340
It's just like, I just don't understand.

1950
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:35,380
I mean, I understand cause they're making tons of money off of it.

1951
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:39,860
So, but it sounds like that they're just trying to get people hooked on this kind of

1952
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:40,180
stuff.

1953
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:47,380
And mind you that the reason why that $500,000 delivered to you each month, isn't a ton of

1954
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:47,700
money.

1955
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:49,460
It's because of them.

1956
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:52,900
They've designed the game this way to make it incredibly grindy.

1957
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:56,900
And I remember when I first started playing Grand Theft Auto online, it was grindy, but

1958
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:59,380
it wasn't like super grindy.

1959
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:01,300
Like now it's just ridiculous.

1960
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:04,580
The amount of stuff that you have to pay for in that's all by design.

1961
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:07,300
It's all by design, the milk, those microtransactions.

1962
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:08,340
And that's what they do.

1963
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:13,380
And that's how they're making billions of dollars off of this game from just the microtransactions

1964
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:16,660
because you have to pay the upkeep your car.

1965
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:20,740
You have to pay insurance on your car to pay rent for your apartment and stuff.

1966
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:21,540
Yeah, I get it.

1967
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:26,100
It's like real life, but I don't play Grand Theft Auto to experience real life.

1968
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:28,980
Like, I don't understand.

1969
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:30,020
Where's my cheat code?

1970
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:30,820
Where's my cheat code?

1971
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:37,460
It is on purpose because they make money off of this and now they're charging more money

1972
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:40,100
for it because they're going to make money off of this.

1973
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:42,740
It's just it's very blatant.

1974
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:44,340
Like how cash grabby this is.

1975
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:48,660
Well, mind you also, like I would say you're doing you're doing the right thing in voicing

1976
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:50,820
your opposition by not playing.

1977
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:52,660
You're not sitting there playing the game going.

1978
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:53,140
I hate it.

1979
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:53,540
I hate it.

1980
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:54,020
I hate it.

1981
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:54,900
You're just not playing.

1982
01:53:55,860 --> 01:53:56,420
Exactly.

1983
01:53:56,420 --> 01:54:00,900
Like if I was supposed to purchase the game, it would be on PC and it would be just to

1984
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:03,380
play the single player and mess with mods.

1985
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:04,100
And that's it.

1986
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:05,940
I wouldn't be playing Grand Theft Auto online.

1987
01:54:05,940 --> 01:54:07,540
I have no interest in it.

1988
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:11,060
And I understand that they're adding new content to Grand Theft Auto online.

1989
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:15,300
But yeah, they should be if they're making a billion dollars off of that.

1990
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:19,620
That that's that's like another Grand Theft Auto five every year.

1991
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:24,740
Like, yes, they should be putting money into that if that's how much money they're making

1992
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,140
out of it.

1993
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:28,100
I mean, that's only fair, though.

1994
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:32,740
And even I think what they're putting into it is not exactly what they're getting out

1995
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:32,980
of it.

1996
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:36,660
I think they're putting in far less versus what they're getting out.

1997
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:42,580
So you do you, I guess, rock star, but like, I'm just not supporting it.

1998
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:44,500
All right.

1999
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,860
Well, moving on, we have another story from Dark Sakura.

2000
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:50,760
We do.

2001
01:54:52,260 --> 01:55:02,660
So this is another sad outcome from the utter, utterly ridiculous actions taken by Russia

2002
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:03,460
against Ukraine.

2003
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:12,500
There is a video game history center in Ukraine is called the Mariupol Computer Museum.

2004
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:20,660
It was destroyed earlier this week by a Russian bomb at over 120 retro computers and consoles,

2005
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:25,780
as well as over 500 exhibits were destroyed.

2006
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:34,820
It was owned by Dimitri Cherapanov, and he wanted to use it to highlight the retro.

2007
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,580
Let me actually rewind back.

2008
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:44,660
He wanted to make it just to show the history of retro computing consoles technology, anything

2009
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:50,340
from the 1950s up to the early 2000s, a collection that took him over 20 years to make.

2010
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:55,540
And it's absolutely disgusting.

2011
01:55:58,420 --> 01:56:04,100
Cherapanov is accepting donations to help rebuild the computer museum, at least in digital form.

2012
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:05,380
He's got a website out.

2013
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:09,220
I'll see if I can link it in chat.

2014
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:17,460
But it's just, it's one part of this absolutely disgusting event.

2015
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:24,340
And I'm just so irritated by it.

2016
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:28,260
Irritated is a light word, but I'm completely off.

2017
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:35,140
I mean, it's disgusting that Putin's army attacks museums, libraries, theaters.

2018
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:37,940
And the thing is, it wasn't a target.

2019
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:40,340
It was there.

2020
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:42,180
Oh, but still.

2021
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,900
Why would they target a video game museum?

2022
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:45,620
They wouldn't do that.

2023
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:49,300
When they bomb, they bomb city centers.

2024
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:55,300
They bomb places that, you know, that are in general going to make strategic sense.

2025
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:56,740
It wasn't targeted for it.

2026
01:56:57,620 --> 01:57:09,220
But the fact that it was a casualty of this callous, unnecessary behavior is absolutely

2027
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:09,780
disgusting.

2028
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:15,220
Well, I mean, just the fact they're targeting the places where people live and are in the

2029
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:20,180
first place when it was always, you know, the line that Putin is about military and

2030
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:22,900
all this stuff is like very clearly, that's not what's happening.

2031
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:27,060
You know, it's yet another one of those, you know, many lies that comes out of his mouth.

2032
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:29,300
So it's just, well, you know, he's friends with.

2033
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:30,340
Yeah, I know.

2034
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:30,900
It's just.

2035
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:37,140
Yeah, anyway, Biden just said what we were all thinking.

2036
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:38,820
That's all I'm going to say.

2037
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:41,540
All right, moving on.

2038
01:57:41,540 --> 01:57:44,900
He said the quiet part out loud, which a president isn't supposed to do.

2039
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:45,860
That's all.

2040
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:46,340
All right.

2041
01:57:46,340 --> 01:57:48,020
Honestly, presidents should.

2042
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:50,340
Sometimes.

2043
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:50,840
Yes.

2044
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:52,260
All right.

2045
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:53,780
Moving on, Loki.

2046
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:59,540
Then they also started DDoSing Among Us.

2047
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:00,820
When's it going to stop?

2048
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:05,380
But apparently it's been a lot of different services being DDoSed recently.

2049
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:12,340
And the North American European servers are getting DDoSed right now for Among Us.

2050
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:18,580
So it's hard for folks to log in or even play at all because of what's going on.

2051
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:19,720
But.

2052
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:24,180
Yeah, there's, you know, of course, they're working.

2053
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:28,260
Airsloth is still working on fixing the server problems, but they don't have any sort of

2054
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:33,220
update or what on when that's going to be resolved.

2055
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:34,580
That sucks.

2056
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:41,460
Yeah, why would you attack like a small indie game like this anyway?

2057
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:47,380
I mean, I guess I know I was like the answers right themselves.

2058
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:49,300
Like, of course, I should know better.

2059
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:50,740
But it's just it's sad.

2060
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:53,780
You know, it doesn't I don't know.

2061
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:56,020
It's silly.

2062
01:58:56,820 --> 01:58:58,980
Anyway, I have one more.

2063
01:58:58,980 --> 01:58:59,700
I hate people.

2064
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:00,340
I know, right?

2065
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:02,260
I have one more story for tonight.

2066
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:07,620
And it's about it's about a genre that we've started talking a lot more about ever since

2067
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:10,260
Star Soccer and I got into Dead by Daylight.

2068
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:15,220
And that is the 4v1 genre, which, of course, yes, DBD wasn't the first.

2069
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:17,540
We had evolved asymmetrical horror.

2070
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:25,060
Well, OK, I guess this would fall under asymmetrical horror, but a new game was now asymmetrical

2071
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:29,620
horror because I experienced far more horror than I'm sure that the developers did.

2072
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:30,020
All right.

2073
01:59:30,020 --> 01:59:31,060
Well, I got to hear about this.

2074
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:35,380
So this is the announcement for Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed.

2075
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:38,820
It is an asymmetrical multiplayer game.

2076
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:43,060
I guess, you know, I don't think Ghostbusters was ever really scary, but, you know, I would

2077
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:48,900
say some some horror falls in that Vincent Price and Elvira category where it's not scary.

2078
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:49,860
It's just dark.

2079
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:57,860
So Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed is being created by Friday the 13th Red Flag and predator

2080
01:59:57,860 --> 02:00:00,260
hunting grounds developer Il Fonic.

2081
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:04,340
Actually, I like the Friday the 13th game when it first came out before it hit all those

2082
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:05,220
legal issues.

2083
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:05,940
So I don't know.

2084
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:06,440
We'll see.

2085
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:12,420
In Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed, you put on a proton pack, grab a ghost trap and monitor

2086
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:18,340
the PKE meter as a ghostbuster in a team of four brave souls pursuing ghastly ghosts,

2087
02:00:18,340 --> 02:00:20,260
terrorizing public locations.

2088
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:26,020
So, of course, if you are a ghostbuster, you want to find the ghost, blast them with stream,

2089
02:00:26,020 --> 02:00:28,260
get them in place and then shut the trap.

2090
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:34,660
The ghost, on the other hand, get to fly, teleport between rifts, possess objects and

2091
02:00:34,660 --> 02:00:37,860
use slime and summoning ghoulish minions to win the day.

2092
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:42,740
So Dark Sakura, did you check out the trailer?

2093
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:43,380
Do you have thoughts?

2094
02:00:46,580 --> 02:00:47,860
I don't have any thoughts right now.

2095
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:53,620
I have so many other things I have to play right now that I don't have time to think

2096
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:54,420
of playing anything else.

2097
02:00:55,620 --> 02:01:01,060
I should point out that Ernie Hudson, who plays Winston Zetimore and Dan Aykroyd, who

2098
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:03,620
play Ray Stantz, will be voices in the game.

2099
02:01:03,620 --> 02:01:04,900
So there is a little bit of a tie.

2100
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:05,780
Okay, then I'm playing it.

2101
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:09,700
Loki, what were your thoughts?

2102
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:10,580
It looks dumb.

2103
02:01:10,580 --> 02:01:11,620
It really looks dumb.

2104
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:16,820
Like, honestly, like they had a really good single player Ghostbusters game not that long

2105
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:21,780
ago that was essentially with all the original cast from the Ghostbusters in there.

2106
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:25,140
It's supposed to be a semi-official sequel.

2107
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:28,120
Yeah.

2108
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:30,020
Yeah, that one is.

2109
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:33,620
And this one is just it just looks like a cash grab.

2110
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:36,020
Honestly, like, it just doesn't.

2111
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:38,340
I don't see this doing well.

2112
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:41,300
It just didn't look interesting.

2113
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:45,860
And funny enough, actually, this whole idea of, like, ghosts versus, like, ghost hunters

2114
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:46,660
type of thing.

2115
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:51,700
They have an indie game that's basically this already that was in development and looked

2116
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:52,820
much better.

2117
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:55,300
Like, are you talking about I see people play that on Twitch.

2118
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:56,740
Are you talking about Phasmophobia?

2119
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:58,820
No, it's not Phasmophobia.

2120
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:06,020
It was an asymmetrical game because Phasmophobia is basically you against computer where I

2121
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:12,020
don't remember what it was called, but it was a multiplayer like ghost hunting game

2122
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:20,340
and it was an indie game that came or I don't even know if it's out yet, but I know there's

2123
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:21,780
Phasma, but it's not Phasma.

2124
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:26,900
OK, well, there's and the 4v1 again, I don't know if that's just dead by daylight success,

2125
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:30,020
especially when it comes to Twitch and those sorts of environments or what.

2126
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:33,780
But we're seeing a lot of these and I'm not even just talking about like VHS, but now

2127
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:38,500
there's like an official Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre that's coming out.

2128
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:39,060
That's like this.

2129
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:43,860
I mean, it seems like this is a genre that more people are trying to get into.

2130
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:48,900
And, you know, again, some are going to flop, but some might do OK.

2131
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:49,460
We'll see.

2132
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:52,580
VHS is actually should be coming back online soon.

2133
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:54,020
Yeah, it might be.

2134
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:56,260
I think it's this one, Midnight Ghost Hunt.

2135
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:59,060
It's actually an early access starting March 31st.

2136
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:00,820
Oh, and it's essentially like.

2137
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:06,340
It looks exactly like the ghost was saying, except this looks better, actually.

2138
02:03:08,020 --> 02:03:12,020
Well, I mean, indie games have a lot of good stuff.

2139
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:13,780
That's where your Minecraft came from.

2140
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:15,940
That's where Among Us came from.

2141
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:19,300
You know, the next big thing is oftentimes driven by an indie.

2142
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:23,540
So, yeah, I would say Midnight Ghost Hunt looks way better than Ghostbusters.

2143
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:25,700
Ghostbusters looks cheap.

2144
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:27,700
And that's sad because I like Ghostbusters.

2145
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:29,220
All right.

2146
02:03:29,220 --> 02:03:34,900
We're going to get to our listener roundtable where we get inspiration from all of you.

2147
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:37,460
So we get we get our mailbag.

2148
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:41,220
We might do some calls tonight if you want to join our green room on Discord.

2149
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:47,060
And we also get to your questions in our Twitch chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

2150
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:52,100
We'll head first to the mailbag at participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2151
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:55,780
If you want to send us an email for a future week, let's get to it.

2152
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:57,140
I think we have at least one email tonight.

2153
02:03:57,140 --> 02:03:57,780
Dark Soccer.

2154
02:03:57,780 --> 02:03:58,340
We have one.

2155
02:03:58,900 --> 02:03:59,700
Uno.

2156
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:00,900
Hi. Are you ready?

2157
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:03,620
Hi again, OLR crew.

2158
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:04,900
It's been a long time.

2159
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:07,380
When I started working remote during the pandemic,

2160
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:10,340
I didn't have my commute time to listen to podcasts anymore.

2161
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:13,140
Well, a few weeks ago, I had to start coming into the office again.

2162
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:15,380
So I'm back to listening to OLR as well.

2163
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:18,820
The show still sounds great, even though you aren't in the same room anymore.

2164
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:25,860
Anyway, just writing because one of my big interests is movies and specifically the Oscars

2165
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:27,380
since the ceremony is coming up.

2166
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:32,740
And a couple of weeks ago, you're all talking about theories on how the statues are handed out.

2167
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:37,220
All of the winners receive their actual Oscar statues when they accept the award.

2168
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:40,020
They carry that same statue around all night.

2169
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:44,500
And after the ceremony, the winners go to the Governor's Ball,

2170
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:50,660
where there is an area where a personalized engraved plaque is affixed while they wait.

2171
02:04:50,660 --> 02:04:51,940
That's pretty much it.

2172
02:04:51,940 --> 02:04:55,460
Sorry I don't have much to say about video games right now,

2173
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:58,420
though I am excited for the Rift Tracks video game.

2174
02:04:59,140 --> 02:05:04,580
It sounds like they are taking a page out of the Jackbox Playbook, and I can't wait to play it.

2175
02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:06,660
Keep up the great show, Flaco Jones.

2176
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:07,860
That game looks awesome.

2177
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:10,660
Yeah, strong agree on the Rift Tracks.

2178
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:13,380
So always great to hear from Flaco Jones.

2179
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:18,020
I didn't even think about the fact that people kind of losing their commutes for a long time

2180
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:20,500
kind of cut into the listenership of the show.

2181
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:24,420
I just thought, I don't know, this show was getting worse and people were finding better shows.

2182
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:25,780
No, I'm kidding.

2183
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:32,580
I had a lot of that going on with me listening to that one podcast.

2184
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:35,940
I'm super fond of Stuff Mom Never Told You.

2185
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:36,440
Mm hmm.

2186
02:05:38,020 --> 02:05:41,220
And and I mean, it's.

2187
02:05:42,820 --> 02:05:44,580
The easiest time is when you're on the road.

2188
02:05:45,860 --> 02:05:52,100
It's I run it Flaco Jones, I think, meant this email for last week and we won't talk about last

2189
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:56,260
week, but I think it's interesting because now he's talking about the Oscars, which happened to

2190
02:05:56,260 --> 02:05:59,060
be, you know, I'm not oblivious to what's going on in the real world.

2191
02:05:59,060 --> 02:06:00,100
I know that's going on right now.

2192
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:01,140
You have to go to a birthday party.

2193
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:08,980
Yeah, well, while while this is going on, but I now that that was I'm like, I have heard

2194
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:09,700
this before.

2195
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:14,180
I've heard about the fact that there's like an official party with an engraving station

2196
02:06:14,180 --> 02:06:15,140
and all this stuff.

2197
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:16,740
I have heard that before.

2198
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:18,500
So thanks for reminding me.

2199
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:20,820
I could I couldn't think about it in the moment.

2200
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:23,860
But now you have me thinking about the Rift Tracks game and you have our chat thinking

2201
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:28,820
about it as well as to what Matt says, I'd be down for a Rift Tracks night has Twitch

2202
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:29,700
integration.

2203
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:30,660
Yeah, sounds like fun.

2204
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:32,660
I'd be down for that, that's for sure.

2205
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:37,860
All right, I think we have a caller that wants to come on.

2206
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:40,340
So I am going to try to make that happen.

2207
02:06:40,340 --> 02:06:42,260
We'll see how successful it is.

2208
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:46,500
But I am going to go and bring this person on and say hello.

2209
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:48,420
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

2210
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:48,920
Who's this?

2211
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:53,140
You didn't think my hot take was going to be limited to 15 seconds tonight.

2212
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:54,340
Of course not.

2213
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:55,380
How's it going?

2214
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:56,260
It's good to hear from you.

2215
02:06:57,140 --> 02:07:02,500
Uh, open ended question that leads into the point that I kind of wanted to make.

2216
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:03,000
All right.

2217
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:13,940
What are each of your first biggest thoughts on why scummy loot boxes, transactions, etc.

2218
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:15,540
are all such a thing these days?

2219
02:07:16,420 --> 02:07:19,700
Because they work very well one time.

2220
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:23,220
And for example, Overwatch.

2221
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:27,700
Overwatch did the loot box thing, and it did it successfully.

2222
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:31,940
I think other games did it too that are not in my wheelhouse, like Call of Duty or something

2223
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:32,340
like that.

2224
02:07:32,900 --> 02:07:34,500
Oh, it's just no sports game.

2225
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:36,340
Well, okay, Mass Effect 3.

2226
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:41,540
And that, but or as, and Loki did make this point earlier in the show.

2227
02:07:42,660 --> 02:07:46,660
A free game does it first as a way to monetize the game.

2228
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:49,460
And then it's extremely successful.

2229
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:54,900
And then somebody decides, well, why can't we do that on top of the $60 game?

2230
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:58,660
And then you get that Star Wars game from a couple of years ago with Pink Darth Vader.

2231
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:00,580
A battlefield.

2232
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:01,140
Yeah.

2233
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:01,700
Battlefront.

2234
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:02,260
Battlefront.

2235
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:03,060
Battlefront.

2236
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:03,560
Battlefront.

2237
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:05,060
Yeah.

2238
02:08:05,060 --> 02:08:07,540
EA EA battle game.

2239
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:07,940
Right.

2240
02:08:07,940 --> 02:08:09,940
License character three.

2241
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:10,580
Exactly.

2242
02:08:12,100 --> 02:08:15,300
So yeah, that's my thought.

2243
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:18,100
So okay, you started with the question, but.

2244
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:24,740
I, the, the rest of the, the rest of the point that I have is a little bit of a ramble and

2245
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:28,580
it's a really conflicting thought because of my own punditry and whatnot as well.

2246
02:08:30,020 --> 02:08:32,980
Back in, oh geez, what year would this have been?

2247
02:08:32,980 --> 02:08:34,500
2015.

2248
02:08:35,700 --> 02:08:40,820
I was, I was a lot more into the tech punditry world than I am, than I have been in many

2249
02:08:40,820 --> 02:08:41,380
years now.

2250
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:45,140
I don't know if any of you know the name MG Siegler.

2251
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:51,060
Um, big wig investor, been on a bunch of podcasts, uh, guests of podcasts.

2252
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:56,340
He's a, he's a big name in the punditry world and he's aligned with, uh, Oh geez.

2253
02:08:56,340 --> 02:08:56,980
I actually don't know.

2254
02:08:56,980 --> 02:09:01,300
I think he, I think he stepped up to Google ventures from, from lesser ones and that kind

2255
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:02,020
of stuff.

2256
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:07,940
At any rate, like I have not to, not to go all in on just all, all, you know, all management

2257
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:10,020
is evil, but that's certainly kind of a thing.

2258
02:09:10,020 --> 02:09:15,060
Just that the business management thing really ticks me off in the artistic sphere.

2259
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:16,180
It's not far off.

2260
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:16,900
Let's be real.

2261
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:19,700
MG Siegler.

2262
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:26,340
I, I, I always disagreed with him a little bit and he was a lot more brash than I typically

2263
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:29,700
like personalities to be personalities that I actually pay attention to.

2264
02:09:29,700 --> 02:09:34,580
But the one thing that really got under my skin was that, uh, there was this one article

2265
02:09:34,580 --> 02:09:40,420
that he was talking about, uh, Nintendo products should not be controlled by Nintendo.

2266
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:43,860
Nintendo should not make decisions about Nintendo.

2267
02:09:43,860 --> 02:09:46,660
That's just the whole, why isn't Mario on PS5?

2268
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:50,420
That's, that's, that is that exact same argument in another dress.

2269
02:09:50,980 --> 02:09:56,580
And remember, remember the year, the context in particular was we, you, uh, and I, I know

2270
02:09:56,580 --> 02:10:01,060
I've said on this show multiple times that like, you know, the, the SNES was good.

2271
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:07,380
The N64 was difficult and weird, but probably okay because of the generational, you know,

2272
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:13,380
the 3d, the great 3d transition kind of mitigated the roughness that the Nintendo 64 had.

2273
02:10:13,940 --> 02:10:19,860
The GameCube, I actually kind of put in cult classic territory where it was damn good and

2274
02:10:19,860 --> 02:10:23,780
had amazing games, but it certainly fell behind.

2275
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:26,260
It was certainly, you know, number three amongst the big three.

2276
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:28,900
But it had amazing titles.

2277
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:36,020
And I've said numerous times about how the Wii was a gigantic breakout because of Wii Sports.

2278
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:38,820
And the rest of it's normal.

2279
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:42,260
It's normal, you know, gamer base, the people that enjoy these kinds of things.

2280
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:47,940
The Wii U, Nintendo, you know, tried to do what they thought was a success and it was,

2281
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:51,700
yeah, it was problematic for every reason that it was.

2282
02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:56,900
Well, you know, I'm going to bring this up because, you know, this is the hill I will

2283
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:58,740
die on when it comes to the Wii U.

2284
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:01,780
I'm going to point me to the hill and I will go die on it.

2285
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:05,380
This is not going to surprise you or anyone that's listened to this show for any amount

2286
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:05,780
of time.

2287
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:12,100
The Wii U would have had an entirely different trajectory if they'd given it a better name.

2288
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:17,220
I agree with that.

2289
02:11:17,220 --> 02:11:23,220
The minute, just the last thought, the minute they showed up on the Tonight Show and the

2290
02:11:23,220 --> 02:11:25,220
guy, was it Fallon or Leno?

2291
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:25,700
I don't know at the time.

2292
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:26,500
I think it was Fallon.

2293
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:29,380
Fallon at the time goes, so this is an expansion for the Wii?

2294
02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:32,260
No, this is a new thing.

2295
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:34,420
That was the moment that system was fucked.

2296
02:11:35,380 --> 02:11:39,300
And that should have been the way the tea leaves said this system is fucked.

2297
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:44,580
If Jimmy Fallon didn't understand that, how is Soccer Mom USA shopping at Walmart going

2298
02:11:44,580 --> 02:11:45,700
to understand that?

2299
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:52,100
And that the name fucked that system harder than any name has ever fucked a system.

2300
02:11:54,180 --> 02:11:58,580
I agree that it's not one thing.

2301
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:04,980
There certainly is, to an extent, a majority thing that was absolutely a big thing.

2302
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:13,140
And along the lines of a saying that I've recently adopted, you cannot reproduce lightning

2303
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:14,100
in a bottle.

2304
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:16,180
And the Wii was lightning in a bottle.

2305
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:19,860
So when they focused on lightning in a bottle and it isn't that, well, it's a failure.

2306
02:12:19,860 --> 02:12:20,820
No, it's not.

2307
02:12:20,820 --> 02:12:23,860
There were still some pretty damn good elements of the Wii U.

2308
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:26,020
They just were seen in a different lens.

2309
02:12:26,020 --> 02:12:29,780
Nintendo wanted the Wii U also, I think, on the technical level.

2310
02:12:30,340 --> 02:12:35,860
You obviously, everybody sees how we got to the Switch from the Wii U.

2311
02:12:35,860 --> 02:12:41,300
And I think a lot of people look at the Wii U and go, man, I bet Nintendo wanted that

2312
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:44,900
to be the Switch and they just couldn't bottle it.

2313
02:12:44,900 --> 02:12:51,380
So they did what they thought was the next best thing and gave it a crappy name when

2314
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:54,740
it had nothing to do with what made the Wii the Wii.

2315
02:12:54,740 --> 02:13:00,420
And then that's why now when they called it the Switch, now they go on Fallon, same

2316
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:03,140
fucking show, make a much better argument.

2317
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:07,220
But again, I'm trying not to keep falling back on the name thing, but it's important.

2318
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:12,660
I really, truly believe it was the biggest problem with that system and why it did so

2319
02:13:12,660 --> 02:13:13,460
poorly.

2320
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:19,540
That and the crappy third party releases that were copies of year old games.

2321
02:13:19,540 --> 02:13:20,660
But I digress.

2322
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:27,460
My point was Nintendo kind of, I think, was under a lot of pressure, probably from those

2323
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:33,780
same third parties that then gave them literal scraps for their system.

2324
02:13:34,820 --> 02:13:39,380
I think Nintendo was under a lot of pressure to step it up from a technical perspective.

2325
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:47,620
Remember, the Wii could barely handle 480i in a day when HDTVs were taken off, right?

2326
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:53,620
HDTVs were unheard of in 2006, but the Wii could not output 720 pixels.

2327
02:13:54,740 --> 02:14:01,140
So I think Nintendo was under a lot of pressure from third party companies to put out something

2328
02:14:01,140 --> 02:14:06,420
technically advanced, but like that could be the Wii.

2329
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:12,180
And I think that's why Nintendo ultimately picked the name that fucked them, because

2330
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:16,100
they were trying to appease these third parties that left them at the altar.

2331
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:20,180
I swear this is exactly how it played out.

2332
02:14:20,180 --> 02:14:24,180
They picked the name to appease the third parties who ended up stabbing them in the

2333
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:24,820
back at the end.

2334
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:26,500
Absolutely.

2335
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:29,380
And have been on again, off again.

2336
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:33,220
The Nintendo 64 was difficult to develop for intentionally.

2337
02:14:34,020 --> 02:14:35,860
Yeah, the Nintendo relationship.

2338
02:14:36,740 --> 02:14:42,900
Nintendo has always been a highly unique, has always carved out their highly unique

2339
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:50,020
niche, which was not as dramatic in the simpler times of gaming and is a lot worse.

2340
02:14:50,020 --> 02:14:55,140
So now with the big in battles of Sony and Microsoft.

2341
02:14:55,140 --> 02:14:56,180
And do you know why?

2342
02:14:56,180 --> 02:14:58,340
Do you know why that's Nintendo's approach, Jason?

2343
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:01,220
Because now I know that's not what you called in about, but now you've got me on a whole

2344
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:03,540
other thing because I just had an aha moment.

2345
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:05,460
As you were saying, I had an aha moment.

2346
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:05,780
Fun.

2347
02:15:05,780 --> 02:15:06,980
And it's how they see the world.

2348
02:15:06,980 --> 02:15:11,780
No, this is because no, I'm talking about the third parties and why Nintendo is never

2349
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:20,660
really like them or have them in a place because Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment

2350
02:15:20,660 --> 02:15:22,980
System under those pretenses.

2351
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:25,700
Think about this.

2352
02:15:25,700 --> 02:15:30,020
When Nintendo came into the market, it was after the crash of 1984.

2353
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:32,580
What caused the crash of 1984?

2354
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:39,380
Atari money grabbing, terrible licensing deals, shitty ports, shitty adaptations.

2355
02:15:39,380 --> 02:15:40,260
Ports weren't a thing.

2356
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:42,180
Literally terrible business decision.

2357
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:49,220
Everybody developing everything for the Atari started the crash of 1984.

2358
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:54,820
Chuck Purina Chuck Wagon caused the video game crash of 1984.

2359
02:15:54,820 --> 02:15:55,220
Okay.

2360
02:15:55,220 --> 02:15:56,660
And all of those things.

2361
02:15:56,660 --> 02:16:00,580
So my whole point was Nintendo enters the market now with the Nintendo Entertainment

2362
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:01,140
System.

2363
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:03,300
And you may or may not recall this rule.

2364
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:08,020
Nintendo had a rule in place for the Nintendo Entertainment System, not the not the family

2365
02:16:08,020 --> 02:16:11,460
seal of quality, not just that, but the yeah.

2366
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:16,660
Well, yeah, it was that because the whole we will not allow you to release more than

2367
02:16:16,660 --> 02:16:22,740
three games a year under your label because of Atari, basically, is it was the unsaid

2368
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:24,580
part because of Atari.

2369
02:16:24,580 --> 02:16:27,620
And so that's why get you Nintendo seal of quality.

2370
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:29,380
You can only get three games a year.

2371
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:32,180
This is why we got ultra games, right?

2372
02:16:32,180 --> 02:16:37,060
Ultra games was just Konami trying to release three more games a year.

2373
02:16:37,060 --> 02:16:40,340
And then suddenly people started to find their way around the seal of quality.

2374
02:16:40,340 --> 02:16:44,900
And then at some point, ironically, Atari comes into the room and says, You know what?

2375
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:46,420
Fuck the seal of quality.

2376
02:16:46,420 --> 02:16:49,460
We're going to reverse engineer our own fucking cartridge.

2377
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:51,140
And then that's a whole lawsuit, right?

2378
02:16:51,140 --> 02:16:51,460
Colored.

2379
02:16:52,820 --> 02:16:54,580
Yeah, that whole thing happens.

2380
02:16:54,580 --> 02:16:59,380
And then now Nintendo has to retreat from that perspective a little bit, especially

2381
02:16:59,380 --> 02:17:01,380
by the time the Super Nintendo comes out.

2382
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:09,540
But now Nintendo's culture, it's been set from 1985 or four when it no 1985 when the

2383
02:17:09,540 --> 02:17:11,460
NES came out, not the Famicom NES came out.

2384
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:15,140
Nintendo has always seen the third party as the enemy.

2385
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:19,620
To say nothing about all the other times they've dipped their toes under the water and things

2386
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:20,500
have gone sideways.

2387
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:22,820
The Nintendo PlayStation, the CDI.

2388
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:30,980
So I mean, the DD, I think I assume I don't actually know enough about the DD, but certainly

2389
02:17:31,220 --> 02:17:36,580
the Virtual Boy, they've had their fair flops that didn't even have the ability to permeate

2390
02:17:36,580 --> 02:17:37,140
much longer.

2391
02:17:37,140 --> 02:17:37,780
Let's be real.

2392
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:43,700
When Nintendo tried to allow themselves to be the third party, that led to that.

2393
02:17:43,700 --> 02:17:47,860
Well, I mean, technically is more of a licensing IP agreement, but I was gonna say the CDI

2394
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:49,860
games were what they got out of that.

2395
02:17:49,860 --> 02:17:54,900
And honestly, I can understand why Nintendo is like never again after that.

2396
02:17:54,900 --> 02:18:00,260
Like it is written on a wall in a boardroom somewhere.

2397
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:01,140
Never again.

2398
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:07,300
And that was written on the wall in like 1998 or whenever that game was out and has not

2399
02:18:07,300 --> 02:18:08,660
been removed ever since.

2400
02:18:09,300 --> 02:18:14,660
Yeah, and it is unfortunate that they because they have their own opinions that go in their

2401
02:18:14,660 --> 02:18:21,460
own direction and the switch isn't 10 times bigger volumetrically that it doesn't have

2402
02:18:21,460 --> 02:18:27,380
the latest, the latest processor spec of the tech industry that drives the modern gaming

2403
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:28,020
industry.

2404
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:34,420
Yeah, it's a shame that things have to be lesser to fit on Switch on the flip side,

2405
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:36,660
the switches experience and everything else.

2406
02:18:36,660 --> 02:18:41,620
I like I've told at least 10 people this over the last month.

2407
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:48,900
Odyssey, Breath of the Wild, Arceus and Kirby being open world, free form, smooth as hell

2408
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:53,060
are a joy and docked and portable.

2409
02:18:53,060 --> 02:18:55,140
I don't give a shit that they don't look realistic.

2410
02:18:55,140 --> 02:18:57,380
The games, you know, that's not the games motif anyways.

2411
02:18:57,380 --> 02:19:04,260
But like these games for all of the series, like I've never beaten a Pokemon game until

2412
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:04,740
Arceus.

2413
02:19:04,740 --> 02:19:05,780
I'm very close to it.

2414
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:08,580
I've never beaten a Zelda game until Breath of the Wild.

2415
02:19:08,580 --> 02:19:12,740
I did do at least a base pack, not Champions Quest, blah, blah, blah.

2416
02:19:14,020 --> 02:19:15,060
Yeah, Champions Quest.

2417
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:21,620
Like I subscribe to Nintendo's design principles.

2418
02:19:21,620 --> 02:19:22,980
I play games for fun.

2419
02:19:23,860 --> 02:19:26,180
I respect pro gamers.

2420
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:28,660
I respect speed runners.

2421
02:19:28,660 --> 02:19:29,460
I love watching.

2422
02:19:29,460 --> 02:19:31,460
It could never do it like you do.

2423
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:32,820
You have your own opinion.

2424
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:34,500
I'm not saying don't do that.

2425
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:37,780
I'm saying that I enjoy what I get out of Nintendo.

2426
02:19:37,780 --> 02:19:42,340
Yes, I would like most, but I'm going to take what I get and I'm going to take what I get

2427
02:19:42,340 --> 02:19:43,860
and I enjoy it and I do.

2428
02:19:43,860 --> 02:19:45,460
And that's kind of what drives me.

2429
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:50,580
Anyway, I think I took the car in a completely different direction from what you originally

2430
02:19:50,580 --> 02:19:51,380
called in about, Jason.

2431
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:56,100
I'm sorry, but business people should not make artistic

2432
02:19:56,100 --> 02:19:56,660
decisions.

2433
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:57,540
Okay, we agree on that.

2434
02:19:57,540 --> 02:20:02,900
It's unfortunate that business people are driving art down people's throats as the primary

2435
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:03,300
asset.

2436
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:08,580
And this is completely an issue with the game industry completely because the people making

2437
02:20:08,580 --> 02:20:10,100
decisions that are shitty.

2438
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:11,220
Let's say Bobby Kotick.

2439
02:20:11,220 --> 02:20:13,140
Let's take the shittiest one of them all.

2440
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:15,060
The shittiest one of all time.

2441
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:17,460
The shittiest gaming executive of all time.

2442
02:20:17,460 --> 02:20:18,260
Bobby Kotick.

2443
02:20:19,380 --> 02:20:20,100
Not a gamer.

2444
02:20:20,980 --> 02:20:21,620
Businessman.

2445
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:26,500
He's a lot of other crappy things, too, but he's definitely not a gamer.

2446
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:29,780
Now let's take one of the best in the industry right now.

2447
02:20:29,780 --> 02:20:35,140
Phil Spencer and Microsoft Gamer came up from those rates.

2448
02:20:35,140 --> 02:20:35,940
Huge advocate.

2449
02:20:36,580 --> 02:20:38,260
Still doing the same thing that he's done best.

2450
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:41,140
These what, four, three, four generations after?

2451
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:48,020
And to Nintendo's credit and how they make such good fucking games, many of them came

2452
02:20:48,020 --> 02:20:50,580
up the ranks, still play games.

2453
02:20:50,580 --> 02:20:55,860
And there is a certain love of video games from those first party Nintendo developers

2454
02:20:55,860 --> 02:21:04,740
from the House of Miyamoto, from that whole area, that whole team that feels such love

2455
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:09,220
for the video game that it shows in the product that comes out.

2456
02:21:09,220 --> 02:21:15,860
It doesn't feel like a cash grab because Nintendo, for the most part, has been the last one to

2457
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:17,620
the party for most of those things.

2458
02:21:18,260 --> 02:21:23,700
Not all of the time, but for the most part, we're not seeing shitty season passes in

2459
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:25,380
Pokemon Arceus, right?

2460
02:21:27,300 --> 02:21:33,380
So the updates that they do put out, like the Breath of the Wild add ins, are entirely

2461
02:21:35,220 --> 02:21:39,540
Nintendo DLC is usually for the most part, by and large, pretty good.

2462
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:42,020
Top line.

2463
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:43,060
Sorry.

2464
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:46,980
I said for the most part, don't fucking change the argument.

2465
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:47,560
Yeah.

2466
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:50,900
Switch online is a different problem.

2467
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:54,580
Art does not come from the place that business does, and business is too heartless to be

2468
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:55,080
art.

2469
02:21:55,540 --> 02:22:01,060
And so when you make art via business, you get it wrong unless you're insanely lucky

2470
02:22:01,060 --> 02:22:02,740
and you cannot design to be lucky.

2471
02:22:02,740 --> 02:22:03,940
You just get lucky.

2472
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:05,140
This is the thing that happens.

2473
02:22:05,140 --> 02:22:07,140
Quest Buster nails it, and I should have said this, too.

2474
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:12,580
Iwata came up the ranks as a programmer through HAL to head Nintendo years later and could

2475
02:22:12,580 --> 02:22:13,780
still read code.

2476
02:22:13,780 --> 02:22:18,100
That is why Balloon Fight, even if it's not your favorite Nintendo game, if there's a

2477
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:23,060
list of 10 Nintendo games you must play before you leave this world or whatever, Balloon

2478
02:22:23,060 --> 02:22:24,580
Fight should be one of the 10.

2479
02:22:24,580 --> 02:22:28,020
And I'm not saying Balloon Fight is the greatest NES game that was ever written.

2480
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:30,900
In fact, Balloon Fight is basically a Joust clone, right?

2481
02:22:32,020 --> 02:22:34,340
Because that's what it was actually started to be written as.

2482
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:36,500
It was supposed to be just an NES port of Joust.

2483
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:39,540
But anyway, my point, and I think you all know what I'm getting to.

2484
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:41,620
That was a game that was made by Iwata.

2485
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:46,820
So that is why you should play that game, because that was Iwata's game that he wrote

2486
02:22:47,460 --> 02:22:48,420
as a programmer.

2487
02:22:48,980 --> 02:22:55,380
And I think you should play that to see that's where he came through the ranks and designed

2488
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:55,780
that.

2489
02:22:55,780 --> 02:23:01,700
And even if you look at it from the perspective of a Joust clone, it still added a new mode

2490
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:05,700
to the game that I think exceeded the clone part.

2491
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:06,500
You know what I mean?

2492
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:10,740
Like there's that base game that feels like Joust, but then there's that story mode that's

2493
02:23:10,740 --> 02:23:13,380
like that eternal scroller to the left.

2494
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:19,700
That mode is remembered a lot more fondly than the mode that actually was the Joust

2495
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:20,340
part of the game.

2496
02:23:20,900 --> 02:23:21,460
Oh, yeah.

2497
02:23:21,460 --> 02:23:23,060
I don't remember that.

2498
02:23:23,060 --> 02:23:26,180
I only remember the lock screen battle because you brought it up.

2499
02:23:26,180 --> 02:23:30,660
The scroller is absolutely the adventure is what resonates in my brain.

2500
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:35,860
Technically, the lock screen battle was a vertical scroller on the versus portion of

2501
02:23:35,860 --> 02:23:36,100
the game.

2502
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:38,100
But I think we get into semantics at that point.

2503
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:40,820
The point is a water wrote it.

2504
02:23:40,820 --> 02:23:42,340
He put a spin on it.

2505
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:42,900
He made it.

2506
02:23:43,460 --> 02:23:47,460
The spin was more memorable than what the game was trying to be in the first place.

2507
02:23:47,460 --> 02:23:52,820
And I think you see that throughout Nintendo's history, which is why his loss was such a

2508
02:23:52,820 --> 02:23:58,580
huge, like, just really like, you know, when that happened at Nintendo, you know, when

2509
02:23:58,580 --> 02:24:01,140
that happened, it shows in the games that came out.

2510
02:24:01,140 --> 02:24:06,820
I'm not saying it's all 100% bad, but you know, when a water passed away, Nintendo went

2511
02:24:06,820 --> 02:24:08,100
through, you know, those anyway.

2512
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:09,460
I digress.

2513
02:24:09,460 --> 02:24:17,300
Art is a vision and an opinion, sometimes a constraint, sometimes, you know, giving

2514
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:18,900
up one to satisfy the other.

2515
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:25,620
And business is all parts to is an all parts guess.

2516
02:24:25,620 --> 02:24:27,540
And it's just not the same world.

2517
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:32,500
And I will lean in the direction of art over business, which is strange considering how

2518
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:34,420
otherwise I consider myself very objective.

2519
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:36,500
But that's me taking it in and not creating it.

2520
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:37,860
So I can be on the other side.

2521
02:24:38,660 --> 02:24:42,660
I can go in what I like of art objectively and not produce.

2522
02:24:42,660 --> 02:24:47,300
Hey, if Loki has proved anything, any idiot can make a game, Jason.

2523
02:24:49,300 --> 02:24:49,940
Very true.

2524
02:24:51,300 --> 02:24:52,820
And I say that I'll leave it to him.

2525
02:24:52,820 --> 02:24:54,180
I say that would love Loki.

2526
02:24:54,180 --> 02:24:55,700
Loki and Loki knows this.

2527
02:24:55,700 --> 02:24:58,820
I go on to podcast panels at Dragon Con, whatever con I'm at.

2528
02:24:58,820 --> 02:25:01,860
And I always say any idiot can podcast.

2529
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:02,660
I'm living proof.

2530
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:06,020
So all right, Jason.

2531
02:25:06,020 --> 02:25:07,540
I'm going to wrap it up so we can take another call.

2532
02:25:07,540 --> 02:25:10,660
But thank you and appreciate all you do for the show as always, of course.

2533
02:25:10,660 --> 02:25:14,500
And yeah, any last quick thought before we let you go?

2534
02:25:15,860 --> 02:25:16,980
I don't have a quick summary.

2535
02:25:17,540 --> 02:25:19,140
Enjoy what you enjoy, folks.

2536
02:25:19,140 --> 02:25:20,180
That's all that matters.

2537
02:25:20,180 --> 02:25:20,660
Sounds good.

2538
02:25:20,660 --> 02:25:21,380
Take care, my friend.

2539
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:22,500
Good night.

2540
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:23,460
Good night.

2541
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:24,820
All right, let's go right into another call.

2542
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:27,620
We're going to bring somebody else here on air and get to it.

2543
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:29,620
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2544
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:30,020
Who's this?

2545
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:34,580
You're on mute and or you stepped away.

2546
02:25:35,460 --> 02:25:36,820
I how about now?

2547
02:25:36,820 --> 02:25:38,500
Hey, it's Rhonda.

2548
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:39,220
How's it going?

2549
02:25:40,820 --> 02:25:42,980
Well, my voice is shot.

2550
02:25:43,700 --> 02:25:45,460
I had a Philly cheesesteak.

2551
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:48,660
I am slowly unpacking from a convention.

2552
02:25:49,380 --> 02:25:52,260
And the last talk with VX Jason XV.

2553
02:25:52,260 --> 02:25:54,900
You got me wanting to talk about more stuff.

2554
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:56,740
So wow.

2555
02:25:57,540 --> 02:25:59,380
Well, what do you want to talk about, please?

2556
02:25:59,380 --> 02:26:03,460
Well, I just want to say, yeah, any idiot can podcast.

2557
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:04,740
I'm just saying, okay.

2558
02:26:07,220 --> 02:26:10,740
And then there are some really smart people who can't podcast their way out of a paper bag.

2559
02:26:11,620 --> 02:26:13,460
Also true, honestly.

2560
02:26:13,460 --> 02:26:20,340
Well, that that is why there was a couple of things I want to talk about, but I can't

2561
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:23,540
remember most of it because I have the memory retention of a goldfish.

2562
02:26:23,540 --> 02:26:26,740
But I want to say I was at a convention this weekend.

2563
02:26:26,740 --> 02:26:27,460
It was great.

2564
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:28,500
It was fun.

2565
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:31,220
Rob, you would have blended in perfectly.

2566
02:26:31,220 --> 02:26:36,180
There was a Rocky horror troop walking by, but I didn't get my camera ready in time.

2567
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:37,460
But that's the thing.

2568
02:26:37,460 --> 02:26:42,500
But what I did was, I don't know if you've noticed, but a lot of conventions are having

2569
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:49,460
Twitch panels on how to set up streamlabs, how to set up OBS, how to do your layouts

2570
02:26:49,460 --> 02:26:50,900
and all of this and all of that.

2571
02:26:50,900 --> 02:26:53,460
And people are just going nuts.

2572
02:26:53,460 --> 02:26:54,900
And streamlabs don't.

2573
02:26:57,220 --> 02:26:58,660
Well, you're right.

2574
02:26:59,380 --> 02:27:01,060
I'm Jamie.

2575
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:02,740
I'm old school.

2576
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:05,140
There are people who use USB microphones.

2577
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:07,780
I have a mixer and I plug everything in.

2578
02:27:09,460 --> 02:27:15,300
Therefore, I did a panel called How to Podcast and Twitch Stream 101.

2579
02:27:15,300 --> 02:27:22,340
Basically, dear weebs, dear newbies, you want a podcast?

2580
02:27:22,980 --> 02:27:24,260
You want a Twitch stream?

2581
02:27:24,980 --> 02:27:25,700
Okay.

2582
02:27:25,700 --> 02:27:27,220
Get your wallets out.

2583
02:27:27,220 --> 02:27:32,100
I'm going to tell you how much money you're going to have to spend if you want to do this.

2584
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:33,620
And that was the panel I did.

2585
02:27:33,620 --> 02:27:35,700
And it went over pretty well.

2586
02:27:35,700 --> 02:27:36,580
Congrats.

2587
02:27:36,580 --> 02:27:40,100
Although I firmly believe and not everybody's with me.

2588
02:27:40,100 --> 02:27:42,500
I firmly believe it takes zero dollars to podcast.

2589
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:44,340
Well, that's right.

2590
02:27:45,140 --> 02:27:49,140
You might have to pay for your server space, I guess is probably the cost you really need.

2591
02:27:49,140 --> 02:27:54,020
But like, honestly, actually, you could do that whole trick with archive.org and all

2592
02:27:54,020 --> 02:27:55,140
that some people do.

2593
02:27:55,140 --> 02:27:57,300
You still need access to a computer.

2594
02:27:57,300 --> 02:27:59,620
You still need access to a microphone.

2595
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:02,340
So it does cost money.

2596
02:28:03,940 --> 02:28:10,420
It may not cost a lot of money if you're going to have a very rudimentary podcast.

2597
02:28:10,420 --> 02:28:10,660
Yeah.

2598
02:28:11,220 --> 02:28:16,020
My point with all of that, because this topic has come up at Dragon Con, because there's

2599
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:18,180
a whole track about this stuff at Dragon Con, right?

2600
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:19,860
That's why I go there every year.

2601
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:27,460
But is that more people get hung up on the what are we going to talk about in each and

2602
02:28:27,460 --> 02:28:28,660
every episode?

2603
02:28:28,660 --> 02:28:35,860
People get more hung up on that or I need to have all of this technical stuff so I can

2604
02:28:35,860 --> 02:28:39,540
get I if I don't have the perfect mic, if I don't have the perfect camera, I'm never

2605
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:40,420
going to be able to do this.

2606
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:47,140
People get hung up on that when the hardest part of podcasting is doing it every time

2607
02:28:47,140 --> 02:28:48,180
regularly.

2608
02:28:48,180 --> 02:28:49,380
That's the hardest part.

2609
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:52,100
You want to know something with Twitch?

2610
02:28:52,980 --> 02:28:55,220
You don't need a camera to be a streamer.

2611
02:28:55,220 --> 02:28:55,720
Same.

2612
02:28:56,340 --> 02:28:57,060
And you want to know something?

2613
02:28:57,060 --> 02:28:57,940
We covered that.

2614
02:28:57,940 --> 02:29:01,700
Like in the beginning, I told people, you want a podcast?

2615
02:29:01,700 --> 02:29:02,660
Open up notes.

2616
02:29:02,660 --> 02:29:04,420
Start writing down ideas.

2617
02:29:04,420 --> 02:29:05,620
Create an outline.

2618
02:29:05,620 --> 02:29:06,500
Get this going.

2619
02:29:07,220 --> 02:29:09,460
Every episode doesn't have to be the same.

2620
02:29:09,460 --> 02:29:10,500
You can change.

2621
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:13,460
I even use Orange Dodge Radio as an example.

2622
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:17,940
I told people about Bemani DDR.

2623
02:29:17,940 --> 02:29:23,860
Let's just say people were were excited and there is a fan of the show in my panel.

2624
02:29:23,860 --> 02:29:32,340
So I explained how when DDR started going down, they switch gears and talked about gaming

2625
02:29:32,340 --> 02:29:38,100
and it's been going great ever since I talked about how you don't need the most expensive

2626
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:38,980
equipment.

2627
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:43,620
I said, look, if you have a PC headset and everybody that you're chatting online with

2628
02:29:43,620 --> 02:29:44,900
say you sound great.

2629
02:29:44,900 --> 02:29:47,300
Start with that and you go from there.

2630
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:48,740
You want to record your show.

2631
02:29:48,740 --> 02:29:50,420
You don't have the money for audition.

2632
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:54,020
There are free audio recording software applications out there.

2633
02:29:54,020 --> 02:29:58,500
Sometimes when you buy your your equipment, it comes with free recording software.

2634
02:29:58,500 --> 02:30:05,940
Like I did I did a review of a device and the company sent me another one to do another

2635
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:06,580
review on.

2636
02:30:06,580 --> 02:30:10,900
This is a very simple audio interface, 60 bucks, and it works.

2637
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:15,780
I think I think it's not like the literal like zero dollars to podcast, but it's more

2638
02:30:15,780 --> 02:30:20,420
the you would be surprised what you can do with what you already have or what you already

2639
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:21,460
have access to.

2640
02:30:23,140 --> 02:30:29,700
So in that drawer of old tech and dig something out, I have a drawer right here and I could

2641
02:30:29,700 --> 02:30:31,220
podcast anything on.

2642
02:30:31,220 --> 02:30:32,500
I even forgot about this.

2643
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:35,140
Bobby in chat says you don't even need a computer anymore.

2644
02:30:35,780 --> 02:30:37,860
Spreaker is a podcasting platform.

2645
02:30:37,860 --> 02:30:39,940
You literally call in with your phone.

2646
02:30:39,940 --> 02:30:42,420
You call it, do your stuff, hang up.

2647
02:30:42,420 --> 02:30:44,820
It makes an audio file and updates an RSS feed.

2648
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:46,500
That's that's where we're at.

2649
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:51,220
That's wild, but that you can even do it with landline landline.

2650
02:30:52,100 --> 02:30:54,340
I would personally rather sound good.

2651
02:30:56,420 --> 02:31:02,580
But I mean, and all of the software that I use, I mean, I've got training on it, which

2652
02:31:02,580 --> 02:31:07,380
is why I use Logic Pro and Final Cut for my video stuff.

2653
02:31:08,020 --> 02:31:13,140
But if you've got a Mac, you get iMovie for free, you get GarageBand for free.

2654
02:31:13,140 --> 02:31:17,300
And I can tell you right now that everything that I do in Logic, there are ways to do in

2655
02:31:17,300 --> 02:31:18,340
GarageBand.

2656
02:31:18,340 --> 02:31:22,740
You can do GarageBand on your phone or an iPad.

2657
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:29,300
I know plenty of people who make all of their music, do all of their promo video and their

2658
02:31:29,300 --> 02:31:31,460
entire podcast from an iPad.

2659
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:35,860
This is where the technology has gotten us.

2660
02:31:35,860 --> 02:31:37,300
I mean, it doesn't take much.

2661
02:31:37,300 --> 02:31:42,580
I mean, I used to upload my podcast to one site when it was published, update the RSS

2662
02:31:42,580 --> 02:31:44,580
feed, then post on the website.

2663
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:46,020
I do everything through Anchor FM.

2664
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:47,780
I upload it to there, they publish it.

2665
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:50,420
I just grab the link, post it on the website.

2666
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:50,660
Done.

2667
02:31:51,380 --> 02:31:52,100
Here's the thing.

2668
02:31:53,060 --> 02:31:56,660
And Bobby is bringing up the whole, if your audio is not good, then you shouldn't use

2669
02:31:56,660 --> 02:31:59,300
it to podcast because I've had to turn off podcasts.

2670
02:31:59,300 --> 02:32:02,500
I can't understand what people were saying because there were six people in a cavernous

2671
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:04,580
room sitting around an omnidirectional mic.

2672
02:32:04,580 --> 02:32:05,300
Here's the thing.

2673
02:32:05,940 --> 02:32:08,500
That show that Bobby's talking about can always get better.

2674
02:32:09,220 --> 02:32:15,060
And as it continues to go on and they start to invest more time in it, they'll start

2675
02:32:15,060 --> 02:32:18,740
to get that equipment and do those sorts of things and so forth.

2676
02:32:18,740 --> 02:32:20,340
Those shows can always get better.

2677
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:21,700
Here's what won't get better.

2678
02:32:21,700 --> 02:32:23,060
And this is the mistake.

2679
02:32:24,100 --> 02:32:29,380
If I were to write that clickbait article, number one or number of reasons, number three

2680
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:30,020
will shock you.

2681
02:32:30,020 --> 02:32:35,300
Here's number three reason why people get into podcasts and then end up not doing it

2682
02:32:35,300 --> 02:32:43,460
is because if you spend $200 on a microphone, that $200 microphone is not going to stop

2683
02:32:43,460 --> 02:32:46,420
you from saying, you know what?

2684
02:32:46,980 --> 02:32:51,780
Let's record the podcast tomorrow because I'm going to go to the movies with my friends

2685
02:32:52,580 --> 02:32:55,140
and I want to go see my friends and I can only do that right now.

2686
02:32:56,100 --> 02:32:57,140
That $200 mic.

2687
02:32:57,140 --> 02:33:01,940
Now, actually, some personalities would say, but the $200 mic actually motivates me to

2688
02:33:01,940 --> 02:33:03,620
stay in and make that decision.

2689
02:33:03,620 --> 02:33:04,020
Fine.

2690
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:05,140
You know if you're that type.

2691
02:33:05,140 --> 02:33:10,340
But for most people, I think you see what I'm getting at is that the most expensive

2692
02:33:10,340 --> 02:33:14,740
equipment in the world is not going to stop you from making a commitment to the recording.

2693
02:33:14,740 --> 02:33:20,740
And when people ask how has OLR been so successful, how has OLR lasted as long as it has?

2694
02:33:20,740 --> 02:33:25,940
Because it has gotten to a point where I don't know what else to do on Sunday nights.

2695
02:33:27,860 --> 02:33:29,540
Rob, there's also one more thing, though.

2696
02:33:29,540 --> 02:33:30,660
I like my ego to be fed.

2697
02:33:31,780 --> 02:33:32,340
What's that?

2698
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:34,980
And a love.

2699
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:40,660
That is something that I said in my presentation, whether it's podcasting or Twitch streaming.

2700
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:45,300
Before you do any of it, you've got to have a love for it because let's be real.

2701
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:48,020
You're not going to make money off of this right away.

2702
02:33:48,020 --> 02:33:52,340
There are those instances where you will jump right on and just start making money

2703
02:33:52,340 --> 02:33:53,540
hand over fist.

2704
02:33:53,540 --> 02:33:55,620
For some people, it takes time.

2705
02:33:55,620 --> 02:33:56,740
It builds up.

2706
02:33:58,100 --> 02:34:03,220
And we took, we fielded a lot of questions and a couple of them were, and I know we've

2707
02:34:03,220 --> 02:34:09,380
probably all been there, where what do you do when you get up and you just don't feel

2708
02:34:09,380 --> 02:34:10,420
like doing the show?

2709
02:34:12,180 --> 02:34:17,380
One of my co-hosts, Wild Spice, who's also on my show from time to time, she fielded

2710
02:34:17,380 --> 02:34:21,060
that pretty well because we also discussed mental health as well.

2711
02:34:21,620 --> 02:34:26,260
She said that she took, she stopped Twitch streaming for a couple of years because of

2712
02:34:26,260 --> 02:34:26,980
that.

2713
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:32,180
And then she started building right back up and getting right back into it.

2714
02:34:32,180 --> 02:34:37,540
And I piggybacked off of that saying, as long as you have that feel, that love, you want

2715
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:38,820
to do it, then you do it.

2716
02:34:38,820 --> 02:34:40,980
If you don't, then you don't.

2717
02:34:40,980 --> 02:34:43,220
It's perfectly okay to take a break.

2718
02:34:43,220 --> 02:34:46,980
If you hit that wall, just chill at the wall and relax.

2719
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:51,540
If you're on social media, let the fans know you are taking a break because you got to

2720
02:34:51,540 --> 02:34:52,660
get yourself together.

2721
02:34:53,380 --> 02:35:00,820
And when you come back, and when you have a migraine, no stream night, and I have said

2722
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:07,060
there have been times where I bring myself into doing this because I love it.

2723
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:09,700
The day that I wake up and say, you know what?

2724
02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:11,860
This isn't fun anymore.

2725
02:35:11,860 --> 02:35:13,220
I'm wrapping up the show.

2726
02:35:13,220 --> 02:35:15,300
I'm probably going to end conventions.

2727
02:35:15,300 --> 02:35:16,340
I'm, I'm done.

2728
02:35:16,580 --> 02:35:19,140
I've hit where I'm like, I've done everything I wanted to do.

2729
02:35:19,140 --> 02:35:20,900
I don't want to do anything else more.

2730
02:35:20,900 --> 02:35:25,940
You know, and I guess it went over really well.

2731
02:35:25,940 --> 02:35:31,860
And I think a lot of people in that panel understood there's a lot more that you got

2732
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:35,300
to do before you actually get into this.

2733
02:35:36,260 --> 02:35:38,500
And I think another and I'm sorry, just real quick.

2734
02:35:38,500 --> 02:35:42,020
Another thing, because and I see several people in chat talking about this, too, is that,

2735
02:35:42,020 --> 02:35:44,980
you know, I don't know what my Sunday nights were before the show.

2736
02:35:45,060 --> 02:35:46,180
This show had Matt.

2737
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:49,540
Bobby says, I'm afraid to go to a life where I don't do something like this on Sunday.

2738
02:35:49,540 --> 02:35:50,340
It's like, I'll be fine.

2739
02:35:50,340 --> 02:35:51,780
I just don't want to get there.

2740
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:54,740
And it's important to say, oh, it's not going to be around forever.

2741
02:35:54,740 --> 02:35:56,260
And I've said this a lot of times.

2742
02:35:56,260 --> 02:35:58,260
There is going to come a day when the show is going to end.

2743
02:35:58,260 --> 02:35:59,940
You know, it's going to happen.

2744
02:35:59,940 --> 02:36:06,340
And I realize it's ironic for me to say this, but I need to say this for everything.

2745
02:36:06,980 --> 02:36:08,980
It is okay for a podcast to end.

2746
02:36:09,860 --> 02:36:12,100
It does not mean you are a failure.

2747
02:36:12,100 --> 02:36:14,740
It does not mean your podcast was a failure.

2748
02:36:14,740 --> 02:36:17,220
It does not mean any of that was a failure.

2749
02:36:17,220 --> 02:36:19,460
You had moments.

2750
02:36:19,460 --> 02:36:26,180
You had that piece of art that you put out however many times you did it.

2751
02:36:26,180 --> 02:36:29,380
Five episodes, 50 episodes, 500 episodes.

2752
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:30,900
You still have that.

2753
02:36:30,900 --> 02:36:32,500
That was a moment in time.

2754
02:36:32,500 --> 02:36:34,100
That was a moment in your life.

2755
02:36:34,820 --> 02:36:35,700
You're not a failure.

2756
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:38,260
So pod culture says, I feel like one sometimes.

2757
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:43,700
Well, let me tell you to stop because pod culture was a show that was on over 10 years.

2758
02:36:44,340 --> 02:36:47,620
And you had a lot of great things that came out of it.

2759
02:36:47,620 --> 02:36:50,580
You know, and plus it's not.

2760
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:59,380
What I say is it in the moments that you feel like a failure or discouraged?

2761
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:02,660
Actually, what I say is feel what you feel.

2762
02:37:02,660 --> 02:37:04,180
Your feelings are valid.

2763
02:37:04,180 --> 02:37:10,260
Do not ignore how you feel, but don't let how you feel limit you.

2764
02:37:11,060 --> 02:37:11,780
It will pass.

2765
02:37:12,740 --> 02:37:15,220
You just have to get up and get back on the horse.

2766
02:37:16,020 --> 02:37:18,580
And you're going to feel like shit for a while.

2767
02:37:19,220 --> 02:37:23,700
I feel like shit when I see one person on my stream.

2768
02:37:24,340 --> 02:37:28,500
And when I get an email that tells me to go to the kitchen to make a sandwich.

2769
02:37:28,500 --> 02:37:29,780
At least I did that one time.

2770
02:37:30,660 --> 02:37:36,100
But my point is, is that you can use that feeling to motivate you.

2771
02:37:36,740 --> 02:37:38,580
For me, I'm a very spiteful bitch.

2772
02:37:39,460 --> 02:37:42,260
And you know how I am when I get spiteful?

2773
02:37:42,260 --> 02:37:43,220
I make shit happen.

2774
02:37:45,540 --> 02:37:47,060
So let it motivate you.

2775
02:37:47,060 --> 02:37:48,180
Let it light a fire.

2776
02:37:48,180 --> 02:37:53,940
If you don't want to feel like that, try to do more of the things that will lead away from that.

2777
02:37:55,860 --> 02:38:00,020
I want to say, too, even though I said all that, I have had podcasts that have ended.

2778
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:02,660
Just remember, y'all, I did Hoard House.

2779
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:04,500
I did Pokestop Podcast.

2780
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:06,580
I have had a lot of podcasts that ended.

2781
02:38:07,380 --> 02:38:08,660
And that's okay.

2782
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:11,620
Tara and I had our comics podcast.

2783
02:38:12,180 --> 02:38:12,740
It's okay.

2784
02:38:14,100 --> 02:38:15,140
Sometimes podcasts end.

2785
02:38:17,620 --> 02:38:22,020
I think you also said, how do you motivate yourself when you don't feel like you're doing

2786
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:22,980
the show?

2787
02:38:22,980 --> 02:38:29,220
And I say, try your very best to show up anyway, because the show might actually put you in

2788
02:38:29,220 --> 02:38:30,020
a better mood.

2789
02:38:30,020 --> 02:38:32,820
And I can't tell you how many times that's actually happened to me.

2790
02:38:32,820 --> 02:38:36,180
I did not want to do the show, but I said, I'm committed.

2791
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:37,540
I don't break my commitments.

2792
02:38:37,540 --> 02:38:38,660
Let's do it.

2793
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:44,900
I show up and you all being here and being as nice as you are, or we have a funny conversation

2794
02:38:44,900 --> 02:38:46,820
or whatever happens is a funny night.

2795
02:38:46,820 --> 02:38:48,020
And I'm like, you know what?

2796
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:51,380
I'm glad I did it anyway, even though I wasn't feeling at the moment.

2797
02:38:51,380 --> 02:38:54,180
Now, some weeks are going to happen like last week.

2798
02:38:54,820 --> 02:38:57,300
And I'll just address that again and say, you know what?

2799
02:38:57,300 --> 02:38:58,660
There are going to be some nights.

2800
02:38:58,660 --> 02:39:00,500
You do show up because you have a commitment.

2801
02:39:00,500 --> 02:39:01,540
You do your thing.

2802
02:39:01,540 --> 02:39:05,060
But there comes a moment where you and this is literally what you all saw me.

2803
02:39:05,060 --> 02:39:08,180
I know you saw me go through this on air last night or last week.

2804
02:39:08,180 --> 02:39:08,980
Excuse me.

2805
02:39:08,980 --> 02:39:10,340
Is that mentally?

2806
02:39:10,340 --> 02:39:17,460
I literally hit a wall and said, if I continue to do this, I'm going to start to resent what

2807
02:39:17,460 --> 02:39:18,020
I'm doing.

2808
02:39:18,580 --> 02:39:22,500
Therefore, I need to stop so that I can come back next week.

2809
02:39:23,220 --> 02:39:24,820
And that's exactly what happened.

2810
02:39:24,820 --> 02:39:25,860
And I'm here this week.

2811
02:39:25,860 --> 02:39:35,380
And to kind of bring on top of that, during the pandemic, the height of it, somewhere

2812
02:39:35,380 --> 02:39:40,180
in there, there was I got a message from Marco.

2813
02:39:40,180 --> 02:39:44,100
She was like, I can't do the show tonight.

2814
02:39:44,100 --> 02:39:45,380
I really can't.

2815
02:39:45,380 --> 02:39:47,060
So I'm like, sure, no problem.

2816
02:39:47,860 --> 02:39:48,580
I'll message it.

2817
02:39:48,580 --> 02:39:50,900
You go and see if she wants to do the show.

2818
02:39:50,900 --> 02:39:51,780
I message her.

2819
02:39:52,420 --> 02:39:53,940
She's like, I can't.

2820
02:39:54,260 --> 02:39:56,340
I my face isn't ready.

2821
02:39:56,340 --> 02:39:58,580
I'm like, don't worry about it.

2822
02:39:58,580 --> 02:39:59,140
It's good.

2823
02:39:59,140 --> 02:40:00,420
So it's just me and Ari.

2824
02:40:00,420 --> 02:40:04,580
So I message Wild Spice.

2825
02:40:04,580 --> 02:40:07,860
She's like, I got to get up at five o'clock for work.

2826
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:11,140
I said, and I'm starting to feel it.

2827
02:40:11,780 --> 02:40:14,580
And instead of getting frustrated, I said, you know what?

2828
02:40:15,940 --> 02:40:16,420
No show.

2829
02:40:17,700 --> 02:40:19,460
I posted on the Facebook page.

2830
02:40:20,500 --> 02:40:21,780
No show tonight.

2831
02:40:21,780 --> 02:40:23,460
Stay tuned for updates.

2832
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:28,180
I messaged everybody and I said, how would y'all feel if we did a show Wednesday?

2833
02:40:28,900 --> 02:40:30,340
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2834
02:40:31,300 --> 02:40:31,940
Updated it.

2835
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:36,660
So episode Wednesday night, nine o'clock.

2836
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:37,300
Come on by.

2837
02:40:38,020 --> 02:40:44,660
We did a show and we were actually raw and honest about why we didn't do a show Tuesday

2838
02:40:44,660 --> 02:40:45,300
night.

2839
02:40:45,300 --> 02:40:50,740
We spent a good time talking about mental health and how we just couldn't do it.

2840
02:40:50,740 --> 02:40:52,180
And I was discussing that.

2841
02:40:54,420 --> 02:41:01,060
As much as I would love to do an episode and if my friends, AK my staffers cannot do the

2842
02:41:01,060 --> 02:41:03,540
show, I am not going to force them.

2843
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:04,820
I'm going to be like, you know what?

2844
02:41:04,820 --> 02:41:06,260
I'm flipping the switch.

2845
02:41:06,260 --> 02:41:08,500
I'm going to go jump on the Xbox for a while.

2846
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:10,580
We'll come back tomorrow.

2847
02:41:10,580 --> 02:41:14,100
If that doesn't work, we'll come back next week.

2848
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:18,500
And if people have a problem with it, they don't have to listen anymore.

2849
02:41:19,220 --> 02:41:20,900
This isn't a job.

2850
02:41:20,900 --> 02:41:25,300
And we still have to remember we have to do the things that we enjoy, you know, or the

2851
02:41:25,300 --> 02:41:27,060
commitments that are more important than this one.

2852
02:41:27,060 --> 02:41:30,980
Like next month, there's going to be a show that Jamie misses because she's doing something

2853
02:41:30,980 --> 02:41:32,980
special for herself for her birthday.

2854
02:41:32,980 --> 02:41:34,900
A person ought to be able to do that.

2855
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:36,980
So, you know, the show will go on.

2856
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:42,660
Loki is I don't know how much I should say about Loki's going to be out for something,

2857
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:44,500
not doing something for something as well.

2858
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:45,780
Yeah, not for something special.

2859
02:41:45,780 --> 02:41:46,740
Okay, that's all I'm going to say.

2860
02:41:47,460 --> 02:41:49,220
And it's one special.

2861
02:41:49,220 --> 02:41:53,460
It's it's one of those things, especially fun anyway.

2862
02:41:54,100 --> 02:41:59,140
But the show will go on and well, I could say more, but I'm not going to say Loki might

2863
02:41:59,140 --> 02:42:03,380
do the show anyway, but I'm just shouldn't go on.

2864
02:42:03,380 --> 02:42:08,340
So so anyway, my point is, is that it's it's this isn't our job.

2865
02:42:08,340 --> 02:42:11,060
And then again, it's that whole resentment when you start to feel.

2866
02:42:11,700 --> 02:42:17,300
But again, part of the reason why the show has been successful is because I do also have

2867
02:42:17,300 --> 02:42:19,620
that buy in from Dark Sakura and Loki.

2868
02:42:19,620 --> 02:42:23,780
And the three of us that have done this show for so long is that we know we're committed

2869
02:42:23,780 --> 02:42:24,580
to this show.

2870
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:31,620
But sure, other things are going to come up once in a while, but it needs to be once in

2871
02:42:31,620 --> 02:42:32,420
a while.

2872
02:42:32,420 --> 02:42:37,380
And in your case, you know, once in a while is sometimes going to be, hey, I hit a mental

2873
02:42:37,380 --> 02:42:38,260
wall tonight.

2874
02:42:38,260 --> 02:42:40,740
I need to take a night for my mental health.

2875
02:42:41,300 --> 02:42:43,540
Okay, that's all right.

2876
02:42:43,540 --> 02:42:44,340
We'll try again next.

2877
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:46,980
Or in your case, you ended up being able to do it the next night.

2878
02:42:46,980 --> 02:42:50,660
Again, you probably don't want to do that all that you don't want to live.

2879
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:51,860
Let's do it Wednesday.

2880
02:42:52,420 --> 02:42:57,860
Have the that be the answer all the time, because then it's like your live audience

2881
02:42:57,860 --> 02:42:59,860
doesn't know what time to commit to you.

2882
02:42:59,860 --> 02:43:00,180
Right.

2883
02:43:00,740 --> 02:43:04,020
But as a one off special thing, we did it in this case.

2884
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:04,660
Absolutely.

2885
02:43:05,940 --> 02:43:06,440
Yeah.

2886
02:43:07,080 --> 02:43:15,240
And before I wrap it up, someone in the audience wanted some advice on everything.

2887
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:20,920
I'll tell you what is the best way I could describe doing a podcast, doing a Twitch stream,

2888
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:24,040
the every investment, everything.

2889
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:26,600
And I said, well, I could tell you this.

2890
02:43:26,600 --> 02:43:33,000
Now I have invested between upgrading my computer, my equipment and everything.

2891
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:38,280
I said I haven't spent over $3,000 in the last three to four years.

2892
02:43:38,280 --> 02:43:43,800
And I have zero regrets because my computer, when it's done being a podcasting Twitch streaming

2893
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:45,800
machine, it's a gaming machine.

2894
02:43:45,800 --> 02:43:46,360
It's a video.

2895
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:47,400
It does a lot more things.

2896
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:50,520
That's what I made sure of and to follow up with.

2897
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:53,880
And I told them this is what I end my show with.

2898
02:43:53,880 --> 02:43:56,440
And maybe this will give you some motivation.

2899
02:43:57,480 --> 02:43:58,760
Hey, thank you for listening.

2900
02:43:58,760 --> 02:44:00,600
Thank you for participating.

2901
02:44:00,600 --> 02:44:01,640
I'm DJ Ron mess.

2902
02:44:01,640 --> 02:44:02,840
These are my co hosts.

2903
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:07,080
We are independent podcasters, independent bloggers.

2904
02:44:07,080 --> 02:44:08,840
We do this for the fun of it.

2905
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:10,520
What we like and don't like.

2906
02:44:10,520 --> 02:44:12,040
We're going to tell you upfront.

2907
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:14,840
If you have any questions about the show, you can drop us a line.

2908
02:44:15,560 --> 02:44:16,600
Email address below.

2909
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:19,180
All right.

2910
02:44:21,080 --> 02:44:24,440
Any other last thoughts for us, Rama, before we let you go?

2911
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:27,320
And we anticipate the next episode of Anime Jam Session.

2912
02:44:27,320 --> 02:44:28,520
Congrats on the panel, by the way.

2913
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:29,320
It sounds like it was great.

2914
02:44:29,960 --> 02:44:30,440
Thank you.

2915
02:44:30,680 --> 02:44:34,280
I will say I was inspired by you doing these panels.

2916
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:36,920
And I felt that, you know, they're doing all these.

2917
02:44:38,280 --> 02:44:41,880
Someone needs to tell these kids how to do it.

2918
02:44:41,880 --> 02:44:44,520
You know, so figure out the Reeses keys.

2919
02:44:45,080 --> 02:44:46,040
Exactly.

2920
02:44:46,600 --> 02:44:47,800
Exactly.

2921
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:49,480
All right, my friend.

2922
02:44:49,480 --> 02:44:50,360
I'm going to let you go.

2923
02:44:50,360 --> 02:44:51,400
Have a wonderful night.

2924
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:52,760
Thanks for calling in tonight.

2925
02:44:52,760 --> 02:44:54,280
It's always good to hear from you.

2926
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:55,240
You all take care.

2927
02:44:55,240 --> 02:44:56,840
I love every single one of you.

2928
02:44:56,840 --> 02:44:57,560
All right.

2929
02:44:57,560 --> 02:44:58,040
Love you too.

2930
02:44:58,040 --> 02:44:58,280
Bye.

2931
02:44:59,160 --> 02:44:59,660
Bye.

2932
02:45:00,060 --> 02:45:00,700
All right.

2933
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:03,660
Always good to hear from our friend DJ Rama S.

2934
02:45:04,540 --> 02:45:09,340
In the meantime, I think we have probably hit about the end of everything we have tonight.

2935
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:10,780
There's nobody else in the green room.

2936
02:45:10,780 --> 02:45:13,180
I think we've gotten through all the emails.

2937
02:45:13,180 --> 02:45:16,380
I will quickly look to Matt to see if there's any last minute stories.

2938
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:24,060
I just want to mention that Epic and Fortnite have raised over 70 million dollars for Ukraine

2939
02:45:24,060 --> 02:45:27,260
because they're doing a fundraising thing with that.

2940
02:45:27,260 --> 02:45:27,820
That's great.

2941
02:45:28,620 --> 02:45:34,460
I'm sure much more fundraisers to come as this unfortunate issue just keeps going.

2942
02:45:34,460 --> 02:45:39,980
What ended up happening was that Epic had raised over 35 million dollars and then Xbox

2943
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:43,260
decided that they're also going to match it, I believe.

2944
02:45:43,980 --> 02:45:44,940
So that's how it doubled.

2945
02:45:48,220 --> 02:45:48,700
All right.

2946
02:45:49,660 --> 02:45:52,860
Well, with that, we will move to wrap up the show.

2947
02:45:53,420 --> 02:45:57,980
Um, and before I get to final thoughts, let me say thank you as always for listening to

2948
02:45:57,980 --> 02:45:59,660

Please tell a friend about the show.

2952
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:09,580
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to help get out here

2953
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:10,300
on air.

2954
02:46:10,300 --> 02:46:12,940
So please tell a friend or two about the show.

2955
02:46:12,940 --> 02:46:17,420

Session that we were just talking to one of the hosts there.

2964
02:46:38,060 --> 02:46:40,860
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and we'll wrap it up.

2965
02:46:40,860 --> 02:46:43,180
Dark Sakura, I know you want to get to the killings.

2966
02:46:43,180 --> 02:46:44,620
So I'll start with you and your final thought.

2967
02:46:45,580 --> 02:46:53,420
Um, I, I'm doing a birthday marathon on April 14th from 10 30 a.m. to 10 30 p.m.

2968
02:46:54,060 --> 02:46:57,500
Come hang out with me for my birthday on my channel.

2969
02:46:58,140 --> 02:46:58,540
The end.

2970
02:46:59,660 --> 02:46:59,980
All right.

2971
02:46:59,980 --> 02:47:00,860
Best of luck with that.

2972
02:47:01,660 --> 02:47:02,220
Thanks.

2973
02:47:02,220 --> 02:47:02,620
Bye.

2974
02:47:02,620 --> 02:47:02,940
All right.

2975
02:47:02,940 --> 02:47:03,180
Bye.

2976
02:47:04,140 --> 02:47:04,620
All right.

2977
02:47:04,620 --> 02:47:06,540
And we'll go over to Loki.

2978
02:47:06,540 --> 02:47:07,820
Your final thought tonight, Loki.

2979
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:12,060
Uh, final thought is I've got to work hard to put out some more videos.

2980
02:47:12,940 --> 02:47:13,580
Mm hmm.

2981
02:47:13,580 --> 02:47:15,100
Hopefully those will be coming soon.

2982
02:47:15,100 --> 02:47:15,420
Yeah.

2983
02:47:15,420 --> 02:47:19,980
I really need to, um, get on producing more of that type of content too.

2984
02:47:19,980 --> 02:47:23,500
I keep meaning to, but you know, other things like the shows and stuff.

2985
02:47:23,500 --> 02:47:27,580
But speaking of shows, my final thought will be, uh, the next show I'll be hosting at the

2986
02:47:27,580 --> 02:47:28,780
end of April.

2987
02:47:28,780 --> 02:47:30,460
Um, it's not really a live event.

2988
02:47:30,460 --> 02:47:34,540
We're just, we're just doing basically a movie double feature with a costume contest,

2989
02:47:34,540 --> 02:47:39,660
but I'm really still excited about it because we're doing Goth Night Out and we're showing

2990
02:47:39,660 --> 02:47:45,100
The Crow and The Craft, which are two quintessential goth movies.

2991
02:47:45,100 --> 02:47:46,460
And I'm really excited about it.

2992
02:47:46,460 --> 02:47:48,460
So that's going to be a show at the end of April.

2993
02:47:48,460 --> 02:47:52,460
Um, the hosting gods have been very good to me this year and I'm so thankful for it.

2994
02:47:52,460 --> 02:47:56,300
Like, you know, between having John Waters a few weeks ago, unfortunately, Leslie and

2995
02:47:56,300 --> 02:47:58,380
Warren had to cancel on the clue thing.

2996
02:47:58,380 --> 02:48:01,900
Um, that was a bucket list item, but you know what, at the end of the day, the performance

2997
02:48:01,900 --> 02:48:03,100
was still awesome.

2998
02:48:03,100 --> 02:48:04,780
Hosting it was fantastic.

2999
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:06,060
The audience was great.

3000
02:48:06,060 --> 02:48:08,060
I did something I rarely ever do.

3001
02:48:08,620 --> 02:48:13,420
And I actually wrote a little bit of standup to do, and it was all clue themed and it went

3002
02:48:13,420 --> 02:48:14,220
over well.

3003
02:48:14,220 --> 02:48:16,620
So that made me feel a little bit better about my abilities.

3004
02:48:16,620 --> 02:48:19,420
That's why my nails are black, by the way, because somebody was asking about that in

3005
02:48:19,420 --> 02:48:23,900
chat earlier is because, um, if you're not doing, if you, if you're not, what is the,

3006
02:48:23,900 --> 02:48:25,580
the line in the Alaska song?

3007
02:48:25,580 --> 02:48:28,140
If you're not doing nails, you're not doing drag.

3008
02:48:28,140 --> 02:48:33,100
And so I painted my nails and I was like, well, black, black nails I can keep, uh, for

3009
02:48:33,100 --> 02:48:33,420
a little bit.

3010
02:48:33,420 --> 02:48:37,180
It's not, you know, whatever, uh, fallout boy and all those bands they have, they started

3011
02:48:37,180 --> 02:48:38,220
that trend for men.

3012
02:48:38,220 --> 02:48:38,940
So it doesn't matter.

3013
02:48:38,940 --> 02:48:39,980
Have you ever painted your nails?

3014
02:48:39,980 --> 02:48:40,380
Loki?

3015
02:48:42,140 --> 02:48:42,780
No, no.

3016
02:48:43,580 --> 02:48:44,060
You know what?

3017
02:48:44,060 --> 02:48:45,420
Honestly, I'll say this.

3018
02:48:45,420 --> 02:48:47,660
If nothing else, paint them clear.

3019
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:50,540
And I've done that because clear stopped me from biting them.

3020
02:48:50,540 --> 02:48:53,980
That's why that's, that's the one that clear nail polish will stop you from biting your

3021
02:48:53,980 --> 02:48:54,860
nails real quick.

3022
02:48:54,860 --> 02:49:00,140
So I would recommend that to anybody, um, regardless how you feel about colorful nail

3023
02:49:00,140 --> 02:49:01,340
polish on your own person.

3024
02:49:02,060 --> 02:49:07,500
Um, anyway, that is, uh, it's, we'll do this again next week.

3025
02:49:07,500 --> 02:49:10,140
Uh, I didn't mention this on the show.

3026
02:49:10,140 --> 02:49:12,380
I'm going to Las Vegas this weekend.

3027
02:49:12,380 --> 02:49:14,140
I will be back for OLR.

3028
02:49:14,140 --> 02:49:17,260
We're taking a Saturday flight back because it's cheaper.

3029
02:49:17,260 --> 02:49:23,180
Um, so, uh, we, with the state holiday on Thursday, we're kind of shifting our weekend

3030
02:49:23,180 --> 02:49:28,460
a little bit, but I'm very excited about it and I get to cross off my bucket list.

3031
02:49:28,540 --> 02:49:33,420
We're seeing Dionne Warwick live, and I'm so excited about that because I love Dionne

3032
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:36,300
Warwick and her Twitter presence and all that is fantastic.

3033
02:49:36,300 --> 02:49:39,100
So, uh, I will tell you all about that next week.

3034
02:49:39,100 --> 02:49:40,620
All right, we're out of here.

3035
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:41,900
It's a time to end the show.

3036
02:49:41,900 --> 02:49:42,780
Have a good night, everybody.

3037
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:43,580
We'll see you next time.

3038
02:49:46,460 --> 02:49:48,940
