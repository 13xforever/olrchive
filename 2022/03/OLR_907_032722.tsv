0	10040	Hot Take Warning!
10040	14960	Gran Turismo has always been the most stunning, technical, beautiful simulation racing game
14960	15960	on the market.
15960	19760	It pushes the boundaries in a very specific way that other games comfortably nestle inside
19760	21380	as they create their own vision.
21380	24860	The increase in graphical fidelity hit a near-kappa generation ago.
24860	29880	Every improvement now is miniscule or an ancillary detail like crowds, environment, etc.
29880	34040	Meanwhile, Pokemon Arceus and Kirby have a choppy distance renderer.
34040	36600	Give me more Nintendo, please.
36600	39800	This is my opinion and you should have your own, but now it's time for your hosts, Rob
39800	43360	Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about the actual Gran Turismo story and the
43360	46360	rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every gamer has
46360	50640	a voice.
50640	55760	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
55760	58440	where every gamer has a voice.
58440	66680	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 907 of our
66680	74720	show once again, I'll get into that in a minute, for this, tonight, March the 27th of 2022.
74720	80680	My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined, as usual, every Sunday night, whether there's
80680	84240	a silly award show going on or not, with my co-hosts.
84240	87080	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
87080	88080	Hi.
88080	90520	How are you, Jamie Summers?
90520	91520	I am.
91520	92520	Yes.
92520	95040	Uh, folks, uh, may notice that are watching live.
95040	100280	The cam is broken tonight, unfortunately, so we don't see you, um, but we hear you discord
100280	101800	just doesn't like to use it.
101800	102800	Discord is broken.
102800	106120	And we learned that last week, but I'll get into that in a moment.
106120	109280	Um, also joining us tech master, Loki.
109280	110280	Hello.
110280	111280	Hi, Loki.
111280	112280	How are you doing?
112280	113280	Good.
113280	118040	So I noticed the game playing behind you tonight is that new tiny Tina Wonderland game, right?
118040	119040	It is.
119040	120040	Yes.
120040	121040	Yeah.
121040	122040	Uh, so have you been able to check that out yet?
122040	128560	No, I have not, uh, uh, I want to check it out even, which is funny because I'm not like
128560	132240	super into Borderlands, but like the little bit that I've played at those games, I do
132240	133380	enjoy them.
133380	138680	And then I kind of like love the idea of the more like fantasy realm setting with that.
138680	143120	So, um, it's a little bit more fancy, but it's, it seems pretty similar to Borderlands
143120	148000	three, but yeah, it's certainly more fantasy, but not completely just fantasy.
148000	149000	Gotcha.
149000	150000	All right.
150000	152520	Uh, anyway, uh, let's get into the show.
152520	153960	We'll get into our kickoff topic.
153960	154960	Okay.
154960	159320	So first let me talk about this because the podcast listeners noticed there was no podcast
159320	163200	last week, even though we did have sort of a live show.
163200	164460	So what happened?
164460	165800	We didn't have a full live show.
165800	169360	We had about maybe 20 minutes of a live show.
169360	173600	Uh, we had so many problems with discord last week and I don't know what it was.
173600	175400	Uh, I was not able to see Loki.
175400	176400	I wasn't able to hear him.
176400	180240	I couldn't hear dark Sakura, even though I knew that the cam issues were going on.
180240	182560	I don't know what was happening, but it was a mess.
182560	185260	It took us 15 minutes to get started with an actual show.
185260	187560	And those of you that were here live saw the whole thing.
187560	190580	It took us 15 minutes to get started live with an actual show.
190580	194360	Then when the show started, I think we got maybe 20 minutes into it.
194360	198000	And then more tech problems started happening where my co-host couldn't even hear me.
198000	200700	And so I threw up my hands and I said, you know what?
200700	201700	I can't deal with this.
201700	202700	We're done.
202700	205080	So I said, shut it down.
205080	208080	So we did, and that was it for the night.
208080	209080	And I was like, you know what?
209080	213680	The 20 minutes that we recorded really wasn't enough for a podcast and it's kind of funky.
213680	216560	So I'm just, I'm going to let it just be like a live only thing.
216560	217600	And that's that.
217600	221320	So if you're on the pipe and you're wondering what happened to the show, that's what happened
221320	222320	to the show.
222320	223320	We didn't have much of one.
223320	225880	We only got through our kickoff topic.
225880	229000	We had barely gotten into our gaming weeks and then we couldn't even hear each other
229000	230000	anymore.
230000	231880	So that was pretty much what you missed.
231880	235040	So we are redoing episode number 907 tonight.
235040	240680	So that's why I said welcome to 907 again, because technically this is take two on episode
240680	244300	907, but with all new stories from this week.
244300	245760	So there you go.
245760	251880	And hello in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where we do tape live every Sunday
251880	255840	night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf
255840	256840	show.
256840	264620	And looking in chat, I see a question coming in about why do you have to reload when the
264620	266660	shows change?
266660	272140	You don't always, so like when you're watching live, Bobby basically stops broadcasting from
272140	274080	his Atlanta home office.
274080	278940	And then I pick up the feed in my Sacramento home office because I have to change the title
278940	283360	and all that stuff too, so that they save as two separate recordings.
283360	286140	There really isn't a way for us to do that.
286300	291420	We would have to literally remote into a central computer and it's just too much.
291420	297620	However, most systems, as far as I know, pick up the new feed automatically.
297620	302220	You don't usually have to stop all together, so I'm not sure why that is.
302220	304860	I don't know if that's just a browser thing or whatever it is.
304860	305860	I'm not sure.
305860	309660	But just to answer that question, for the folks who are listening live, and I do see
309660	314060	in chat that a hype train just started, y'all are so kind, thank you so much for that.
314060	321140	You don't have to do that, especially after last week, but thank you very much for that.
321140	324060	Let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight.
324060	325540	Let's get into some gaming news.
325540	328260	Maybe we could actually have some gaming discussions tonight.
328260	329260	Let's do it.
329260	330260	Loki, why don't you start us off?
330260	333300	I mean, I guess we can.
333300	335660	Or I could sit here and fight with Discord all night.
335660	336660	You know what?
336660	340760	I think it was, and it's, oh yeah, of course, this goes without saying.
340760	346520	So we decide, okay, we're going to meet 30 minutes early tonight, I'll miss Bobby's show,
346520	350840	we need to meet early, try to make sure everything works before we go live, look at the solutions
350840	352160	if we have to go that way.
352160	355320	And of course, we all get on Discord and what happens?
355320	357160	Everything just works.
357160	359300	Like it always has.
359300	362080	Every other week we've done this.
362080	363720	So what the fuck happened last week?
363720	365480	I don't know.
365480	368960	And my thought is, is it because Discord was getting DDoSed?
368960	370580	Was it the server?
371400	373660	Everything in gaming has been getting DDoSed lately.
373660	378980	I know we have a story on it later, but I know Sony got, Microsoft within the last two
378980	382100	weeks was like, everybody's getting DDoSed.
382100	383920	Was Discord getting something?
383920	385220	Was that why we couldn't see each other?
385220	386220	I don't know.
386220	387220	It's a mess.
387220	388220	Anyway.
388220	389220	So I throw it out there.
389220	391860	Okay, Loki, you can talk games now.
391860	397880	So we've been for the longest time hearing rumors and just speculating that, hey, Sony
397880	402600	needs something to kind of compete with Game Pass that Microsoft has.
402600	407780	And I guess that's supposed to be coming very soon.
407780	410740	So they're saying that it could be revealed next week.
410740	414860	The service has a code name, which I'm not going to say because it's stupid.
414860	419880	And we don't need the spread, Spartacus.
419880	420880	It's code name.
420880	421880	I am Spartacus.
421880	426760	It is not exciting enough to have a code name of Spartacus.
426760	432880	It should be like, I don't know, code name Sion or something.
432880	437200	Code name Sony Game Pass.
437200	442760	I guess Sony late to the party got to copy what Game Pass does.
442760	445600	Sony flicks.
445600	446600	I don't know.
446600	451360	So anyways, so yeah, they're going to put out some sort of service.
451360	454480	There's something maybe streaming is going to be involved with it.
454480	458320	It's a lot of speculation until the actual announcement comes out.
458320	460880	So cool.
460880	464920	It'll be coming at some point probably next week.
464920	469200	I think what makes this interesting and why I know a lot of people are always iffy when
469200	473480	it comes to reporting on rumors, but I think it's important to point out it's a lot of
473480	477440	the investor websites that are running with this news.
477440	481040	And that's why it's a little more like this isn't just like somebody's Twitter account.
481040	482320	Like my uncle works at Sony.
482320	485120	This is investor insider stuff.
485120	487920	And one of the things that they did mention, though, out of the report is that the new
487920	495120	service is not expected to have their big titles day one, unlike, you know, Game Pass,
495120	496120	which does.
496120	497120	Yeah.
497120	498120	So.
498120	502800	So basically, like, like one of the biggest sales angles of Game Pass, we already know
502800	507640	Sony is not going to run with and that's the day one releases.
507640	509660	It sounds I don't know if that's true.
509660	516140	It sounds like Sony may rely on its back catalog a little more to bolster it all.
516140	517140	And we'll see.
517140	518140	We'll see.
518140	519140	I don't know.
519140	520140	They could.
520140	521140	Yeah.
521140	522140	Cool, but.
522140	527900	You know, it seems like they're just putting a fresh coat of paint on PlayStation now.
527900	529820	Well, PlayStation now sucks.
529820	530820	Yeah.
530820	536100	I mean, they needed to rebrand it, so I don't blame them necessarily for doing that.
536100	539420	And they're saying that they're going to have different tiers, too.
539420	545300	So they're like different tiers would include video games, streaming demos, back catalog
545300	546300	games.
546300	547300	So it sounds confusing.
547300	551820	Like, honestly, like it's they're taking it and making it worse and more confusing.
551820	557180	It sounds like because we're in multiple tiers, we're not going to have the day one games.
557180	560460	It's like, OK, well, why bother?
560460	562380	Like why even bother at that point?
562380	568060	Well, I could see something interesting happening here, and that would be if Sony is going to
568060	569860	leverage their back catalog.
569860	573900	And this is I'm going to fully admit this is wishful thinking.
573900	580420	OK, Sony does have the advantage over Microsoft that they have a richer back catalog going
580420	584020	all the way back to the PlayStation one days.
584020	590260	A lot of people back in the day said they wanted Nintendo to go the Netflix route.
590260	595360	With their online stuff, Nintendo kind of did that, but still gets dragged over the
595360	599480	coals for it because they don't exactly have enough.
599480	600480	That's there.
600480	606940	No, you know, and here I thought that they were copying Microsoft.
606940	608240	They're copying Nintendo again.
608240	612400	Well, no, I don't know if it's a Nintendo, but absolutely they're copying Nintendo game
612400	616720	because what they're going to do is they're going to have libraries, a PlayStation, PlayStation
616720	620080	two, PlayStation three that they're going to slowly trickle in stuff.
620080	626680	But there'll be some games that will be locked up at the PlayStation plus plus whatever,
626680	631120	you know, you have to pay for in order to get the the extra content in there.
631120	632740	They're copying Nintendo.
632740	635680	It's a Sony move.
635680	638900	But here's here's the point I was trying to arrive at.
638900	644840	What if Sony does it better and actually provides that full rich library out the gate?
644840	646000	You're already disagreeing.
646000	650000	No, no, they won't do better.
650000	654400	Because and is it because well, and the thing that I think is holding Nintendo back is that
654400	658760	Nintendo is pretty much put every first party game they can out on the service, at least
658760	662320	as far as the NES and the SNES goes, like every first party game.
662320	665600	I mean, I'm sure you all can think of an exception or two here or there, like maybe like, I would
665600	669560	say one that sticks out for me is Illusion of Gaia, which I know they published in the
669560	673520	US because they had the strategy guide in that that isn't on the Super Nintendo service
673520	675600	and it ought to be.
675600	677080	So there are exceptions.
677080	682440	But I feel like a lot of third party stuff is what you know, and getting those agreements
682440	684200	can be tough.
684200	689160	I think that they're gonna see because I don't trust Sony to do the right thing here.
689160	695560	The reason why is because we look at what they do as far as like their practices.
695560	702320	So most a lot of games, no free upgrades, you have to pay additional money to upgrade
702320	706560	it from like PlayStation four to PlayStation five type of thing.
706560	707940	Their games cost more.
707940	714840	They're charging $69.99 for their games, whereas Microsoft's charging 60.
714840	722040	They I mean, have been very hesitant in the past to support backwards compatibility.
722040	723760	They well, they did.
723760	727440	They supported it, but you got to buy them again.
727440	728440	Cool.
728440	737040	They also have been stripping away the the free games that they offered in their PlayStation
737040	738040	Plus.
738040	741720	Remember, PlayStation Plus used to have like PlayStation three games, PSP games and all
741720	743140	that kind of stuff.
743140	745960	And yeah, they they stopped supporting those systems.
745960	753600	But you can't tell me that a PlayStation four or five can't run a PSP game or handle PlayStation
753600	754640	three game.
754640	757080	I mean.
757080	761080	It's just maybe, maybe not PlayStation for PlayStation five can handle PlayStation three
761080	762080	game.
762080	765780	And even then, yes, five has PS five has PS four backward compatibility built in.
765780	768020	So it can it can play everything.
768020	770040	I mean, yeah, like emulators.
770040	774520	I know people go emotion engine like come on emulators are at the point where it can
774520	775520	it can work.
775520	780080	The only emotion engine that I'm feeling is the disappointment engine, because that's
780080	784560	that's what I get with Sony is disappointment when it comes to supporting their fans.
784560	786120	Do they make great first party games?
786120	787120	Sure.
787120	789280	They make great first party games.
789280	796040	But you know, once again, that only goes so far, you know, to bolster a console, you really
796040	801360	only looking at a handful of games that define this console versus some other console.
801360	805160	So they really need to make this service attractive.
805160	807440	Because otherwise, people aren't just going to give them the time of day.
807440	809820	Not that they can't anyways, because you can't get a PlayStation five.
809820	814580	But you know, it's just if they were going to like, say, Oh, we'll get a PlayStation
814580	818600	four, and you can stream all this stuff or get these PlayStation five games somehow compatible
818600	819600	with it.
819600	820600	I don't know.
820600	823500	But like, it's just, I don't expect much from them.
823500	825480	So hopefully, they surprise me.
825480	828860	They have you know, what they really should be doing is like, I understand that they're
828860	830900	separate companies.
830900	835100	Because the entertainment company is different from the movie company, but you are a movie
835100	836100	studio.
836260	840880	You spice up some of that with the movies?
840880	841880	Why not?
841880	842880	I mean, like that?
842880	847200	Yeah, I remember talking about that a while ago is that Sony does have something that
847200	850300	Microsoft doesn't have in that department.
850300	854140	And that Sony could leverage their catalog of movies.
854140	857420	Now and that I that would really change the conversation.
857420	864620	I think if now it's PlayStation now is these games and you can stream I don't know Spider
864620	866300	Man or is that now a Disney thing?
866300	867300	I don't even know anymore.
867300	868300	That's a Disney thing.
868300	869300	Okay.
869300	870300	Well, fucking it.
870300	871300	Well, it's kind of in the weird.
871300	872300	You can stream.
872300	873300	Morbius.
873300	874300	Okay.
874300	879460	The Uncharted movie, for God's sake, obvious that you could stream the Uncharted movie
879460	884340	and other things like within Sony's warehouse, you know, or and music.
884340	885700	What if it was all of that?
885700	887620	I think that would be the game changer.
887620	892540	And that's where Sony has something that the other other kids in playground don't have.
892540	896060	So it would be interesting to see if they were to actually leverage that.
896060	899300	So let's see.
899300	901620	Mike Deaf says Spider Man is Sony, not Disney.
901620	905020	I know the rights are complicated there, but didn't ultimately that movie is streaming
905020	906900	on Disney Plus, ultimately, isn't it?
906900	908020	The far from home, whatever.
908020	909940	I think that's where it's going.
909940	910940	Yeah.
910940	913100	So I don't know how they worked all that out.
913100	914980	But streaming rights were probably a part of that.
914980	916540	Oh, Bobby says, no, that's not how it worked.
916540	921360	It's going to stars first stars with stars.
921360	924480	There's too damn many streaming services.
924480	926200	No one's going to stream it from the stars.
926200	927600	I want to get to another question here.
927600	932440	But first, let me say, I usually don't stop to acknowledge this, but I have to.
932440	934780	Somebody anonymously cheered 1000 biddies.
934780	936260	That is no small amount.
936260	938060	So whoever you are, thank you very much.
938060	939060	Thank you.
939060	944860	Also no small amount, Bobby Blackwolf and Obi Wan Jabroni, five gift subs each.
944860	947360	So thank you all.
947360	950480	And there's I didn't even read all the other ones that were smaller cheers.
950480	951480	Thank you.
951480	952480	Thank you.
952480	953480	I see you.
953480	954480	I noticed you.
954480	955480	And I'll read them all at the end of the show.
955480	956480	Thank you so much for that.
956480	957480	You don't have to.
957480	960920	It's appreciated.
960920	966600	With one of those cheers, actually, she helped 10 cheered 100 biddies and said the future
966600	971480	is streaming games via Netflix style subscription.
971480	975420	I kind of think I kind of think, yes, she's right.
975420	980980	I mean, I feel like I've echoed some of this before, because where the movie industry goes,
980980	984460	the game industry inevitably goes and this is absolutely where the movie industry is
984460	985460	going.
985460	990900	And I agree that's going to happen, just not with bandwidth caps.
990900	993220	Yeah, no, I agree.
993220	998500	The bandwidth cap issue has to give and, you know, obviously it's Comcast.
998500	1001060	It's well, and I guess there's other smaller.
1001060	1007020	But if we could get more competition in that Internet space, but you're starting to see
1007020	1008020	it.
1008020	1012000	You know what I saw commercial for the other day, because somebody I know from the Twitch
1012000	1019540	thing and on Twitter is a frickin spokesperson for this now, Verizon has these 5G boxes that
1019540	1022460	you can get to get 5G on the go.
1022460	1027300	Well, because it's not everywhere yet, but it's they're working on it.
1027300	1034060	So Comcast Xfinity and all the other providers with data caps are going to have to worry
1034060	1035960	about this competition coming soon.
1035960	1039220	And again, not to toot my own horn, but I'm going to a little bit.
1039220	1042940	I said this like a year ago, probably two years ago.
1042940	1049580	There's going to come a time where 5G is in 90 plus percent of the country and cable is
1049580	1053500	going to have to compete with that super fast over the air connection.
1053500	1059480	And if mobile continues to offer unlimited plans because data caps are a myth anyway,
1059480	1061740	that's where cable is going to get its competition.
1061740	1067820	And I think once all that gets sorted out and now there's no more bandwidth caps, I
1067820	1074360	think then that's where cloud gaming really starts to get its foot in the door and really
1074360	1077620	start to take off.
1077620	1080260	So let's see.
1080260	1085440	Going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network as 100 Matt says, I think Sony would
1085440	1089920	like to do that, but it depends on what Sony streaming deals has with other services.
1089920	1093620	The obvious thing would be for there to be a Sony streaming service for its movies and
1093620	1094620	shows.
1094620	1098500	But in order for that to happen, they would have to void all their deals with other services,
1098500	1101100	which isn't happening anytime soon.
1101100	1104700	Maybe they could leverage something in their future deals.
1104700	1109580	I don't know, maybe there's something where maybe you don't stream the movie so they get
1109580	1111060	around it that way.
1111060	1115660	But I remember a day and time when Sony sold movies right on their store, did they stop
1115660	1116660	doing that?
1116660	1118220	I thought they were going to at some point.
1118220	1119220	I can't remember.
1119220	1121420	Does Sony still sell stuff directly on their store?
1121420	1123120	Like you can rent or buy?
1123120	1127880	I thought they I thought they were going to stop, but I feel like they still do.
1127880	1132700	So that might be how they get around it is you're not streaming it.
1132700	1135140	You're renting it.
1135140	1141820	As you can do with Sony stores since the PlayStation three days.
1141820	1145700	Fifth Dream does point out, I've got 5G with no campus, my home Internet, and I'm in a
1145700	1147780	tiny town.
1147780	1152540	Mike Deaf says, don't we all already have 5G because we got the vaccine?
1152540	1155380	I wish that were the case.
1155380	1157900	And wants to point out, it's a joke, OK?
1157900	1158900	It's a joke.
1158900	1159900	But it was funny.
1159900	1161540	I like that.
1161540	1162540	Let's see.
1162540	1165740	As Joe points out, Marvel had a deal with Netflix for the Marvel shows.
1165740	1168100	I would like Jessica Jones and those.
1168100	1171580	But when Disney Plus came along, they let those streaming deals on those shows licenses
1171580	1174980	run out before putting them on Disney Plus.
1174980	1180940	So anyway, it'll be interesting to see what picks up with this.
1180940	1184340	I wonder if it will be true that we will see it this week.
1184340	1187140	I guess stay tuned and find out.
1187140	1190700	So we might be talking about this again next week when we have some facts.
1190700	1194520	But until then, let's talk about the facts of our gaming weeks and the types of things
1194520	1196140	that we've been playing this week.
1196140	1197800	I will go to Dark Sakura first.
1197800	1199860	How was your gaming week?
1199860	1203420	It was it was pretty eventful.
1203420	1212460	I in struggling mightily, I managed to get all of the killer adepts for Dead by Daylight.
1212460	1214760	Some of them surprisingly quickly.
1214760	1220380	I was super worried about getting Deathslinger because, well, he's pretty difficult for me
1220380	1221940	to play effectively.
1221940	1228820	And I got his adept on I played two games with him and got it on the first game.
1228820	1234200	And so and then I got Bubba by basically playing super sweaty.
1234200	1239340	But I was tired of him and I got him on Larry's of all of all site of all levels.
1239340	1248900	So yay me and and then I finished Chrono Trigger.
1248900	1258740	And I had that pull up on if I was going to do all the endings or if I was going to start
1258740	1259740	a new game.
1259740	1262460	So I just put it up a poll and apparently it will start a new game.
1262460	1264540	So I put up three options.
1264540	1266500	I put up Star Ocean.
1266500	1271700	I put up Terranigma and I put up Seiken Densetsu 3 or Trials of Mana.
1271700	1275000	And so Seiken Densetsu 3 won.
1275000	1277980	And so I started that one last night.
1277980	1282540	And booed at that because I voted for Terranigma and I was the first person to vote in that
1282540	1283540	poll.
1283540	1284540	Thank you very much.
1284540	1286700	I took a screenshot and sent it to you and said, close it.
1286700	1287700	I can't close it.
1287700	1288700	It doesn't let you close it.
1288700	1289700	I know.
1289700	1291700	But come on.
1291700	1299180	So but at any rate, the people have spoken, it was a pretty big margin.
1299180	1305860	But that means that I'll be doing my next one to vote between Star Ocean and Terranigma
1305860	1310100	and I'll probably will do Terranigma next.
1310100	1315260	I just have to get and I'm not going to do everybody's playthrough for Seiken Densetsu
1315260	1316260	3.
1316260	1324380	I'm just doing Angela's playthrough just because Angela is absolutely ridiculous.
1324380	1331780	And then yeah, that's that's really it.
1331780	1346060	I also I've been trying to find a way to to get a version of Paprium, which I don't know
1346060	1360460	if you know what Paprium is, but it's a fairly recent Sega Mega Drive slash Genesis release.
1360460	1366260	But that it was it has like all these extra chips built into the the cartridge and everything.
1366260	1369340	And it's this crazy cyberpunk beat them up.
1369340	1371340	That sometimes works.
1371340	1375020	It's had problems at a pretty long Kickstarter for it too.
1375020	1384940	And some of the reviews out there are not super favorable as far as the the way it's
1384940	1388980	been working or some of the glitching that's been going on in it.
1388980	1391860	But I really I still really want to want to play it.
1391860	1398060	So I'm working on trying to get my hands on a copy of Paprium one way or another.
1398060	1403460	Bobby, I was just gonna say real quick, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I considered streaming
1403460	1407620	the Live Alive SNES ROM, not trying to step on Jamie's toes, though.
1407620	1409700	Well, I mean, that wasn't one of the options.
1409700	1414020	And plus, as a streamer, like you're you're going to have to step on toes.
1414020	1416660	There's only so many hours in the day and a lot of people that want to stream.
1416660	1418820	So I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about that too much.
1418820	1421220	Like, you know, play what's fun.
1421220	1425300	On top of that, though, I am streaming games that I own.
1425300	1428620	So there's that.
1428620	1430820	To get to get out of that legal gray area.
1430820	1432700	Yeah, I get it.
1432700	1433700	Yeah.
1433700	1434700	Yeah.
1434700	1437860	My my copy of Seiken Densetsu 3 is somewhere.
1437860	1446540	And I probably actually I think I still need to read to get myself another copy of Terranigma
1446540	1450380	because I don't know what happened to my cartridge.
1450380	1452020	I wonder if they're easy to acquire.
1452020	1453020	I don't think they are.
1453020	1454020	It might be a hard one.
1454020	1458940	Yeah, I just and I know we've got we've got.
1458940	1463620	If all else fails, you know, I do also, though, have Mother 3 and I might play a translated
1463620	1466500	Mother 3, but it it depends.
1466500	1472100	So but anyway, that's a that's my gaming week.
1472100	1478100	Oh, and we had a crap load of pinball happening while I was trying to stream on Thursday.
1478100	1479780	We hosted Pinball League.
1479780	1481820	Oh, wow.
1481820	1485740	A lot of people in my house, it was loud and thank God for noise canceling headphones.
1485740	1487380	All right.
1487380	1489180	Loki, we'll go to you.
1489180	1491180	How is your gaming week?
1491180	1496180	It's more Minecraft, as usual, you know, so I was doing a lot of video editing this week.
1496180	1500700	I put out another episode of the Deep Dark World, which is doing all right.
1500700	1503500	The first one's got a thousand views on it now, which is great.
1503500	1507540	Second one, not as much, but, you know, it's fine.
1507540	1511860	And then just working on my new NerdCraft episode right now, building a copper, a big
1511860	1512860	copper farm.
1512860	1513860	So.
1513860	1516620	Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
1516620	1517620	Excellent.
1517620	1518980	Well, good luck on your next video.
1518980	1521180	Look forward to seeing it.
1521180	1526860	Let's see my gaming week, honestly, not super exciting because I had a show last night.
1526860	1530780	That's why I guess I'm not I'm turned the wrong way, but this is a very kind gift for
1530780	1535560	my friend Genevieve, who came to the show last night, these flowers behind me.
1535560	1540060	So we did we did a live stage production of the movie Clue, which is my favorite movie
1540060	1541900	of all time.
1541900	1543940	And I kept it kind of coy and under wraps.
1543940	1547340	I had a surprise role in the in the production.
1547340	1551860	I played Yvette, the maid, in the Clue production.
1551860	1552860	And it was a lot of fun.
1552860	1553860	We madame?
1553860	1554860	We madame.
1554860	1557580	I just want to powder my nose.
1557580	1560860	So yeah, that was it was a lot of fun.
1560860	1564160	Like the cast was amazing.
1564160	1567740	And am I saying that just because I worked with them for all these rehearsals for a one
1567740	1569360	night show?
1569360	1570360	They are no.
1570360	1571360	Well, yes and no.
1571360	1573460	They are truly an amazing group, really.
1573460	1578820	And I have to thank one of the other performers who played Miss Scarlet last night, Miss Mars,
1578820	1584220	is really to thank for my makeup and my wig looking as great as they did because she's
1584220	1585940	a hairstylist by day.
1585940	1591160	And she was like, I can probably work with this and really made the look come full circle.
1591160	1593460	So I'm very thankful to her for that.
1593460	1599300	And just the whole- Did you feel gorgeous in fishnets?
1599300	1600660	Yvette doesn't really wear fishnets.
1600660	1601980	She wears black hosiery.
1601980	1605020	I thought she wore fishnets for some reason.
1605020	1608300	Because your traditional French maid look is fishnets.
1608300	1613020	So it's one of your mind is one of those Mandela effect things where you assume she has them
1613020	1614020	too.
1614060	1615060	I'm sorry.
1615060	1616060	So I had that.
1616060	1618540	But yeah, I mean, it was fun.
1618540	1624300	Oh, I also officially like I don't do these drag things very often, but I thought it would
1624300	1628900	be fun to officially have a drag persona for when I do these things.
1628900	1631960	And so I officially debuted Dale Satan.
1631960	1634740	So D-A-Y-L-E-S-A-Y-T-O-N.
1634740	1637460	And I think most of you can get the joke there.
1637460	1640780	So Dale Satan is my name when I perform.
1640780	1642340	But am I going to do that all the time?
1642340	1643340	No.
1643340	1645740	It's like a once a year for a funny show thing.
1645740	1647480	But the show was great.
1647480	1648480	We had a great time.
1648480	1649480	Yeah.
1649480	1650480	Is that isn't chat?
1650480	1651480	Hey, is that was there.
1651480	1654780	So ask is that whatever you want to ask about the show?
1654780	1655780	Yeah.
1655780	1660260	I would say I am so proud of the tech crew as well, because one of the things that they
1660260	1665960	came through on that really and I think it might still be on the Instagram story at Amber
1665960	1667840	Sweet Shadowcast.
1667840	1671800	They actually rigged a full chandelier out of PVC pipe.
1671800	1675980	So when a vet shoots the chandelier and it almost falls on top of Colonel Mustard, they
1675980	1679200	actually had a chandelier that fell like we were at Phantom of the Opera.
1679200	1680880	It was awesome.
1680880	1684320	That chandelier got fucking wrecked the second time because it drops again in one of the
1684320	1685320	endings.
1685320	1686320	Spoiler alert.
1686320	1688060	It got fucking wrecked the second time, but it happened.
1688060	1689560	It was it was pretty great.
1689560	1690560	Oh, yeah.
1690560	1693000	Azet is talking about the guard dogs.
1693000	1694000	OK.
1694000	1696400	Actually, really funny story about that.
1696400	1701300	So we have to double up on some roles to make that happen, because it's a very big cast.
1701300	1708540	So the dog, the cook and the cop were all played by the same person.
1708540	1713240	And originally and they I think they did the same performance.
1713240	1714240	They use them, they pronounce.
1714240	1718620	So I'm going to say they they did the same performance in twenty eighteen.
1718620	1726180	I think they played the same role, but they use like a dog suit, like I go to like a bed.
1726180	1733740	What do you the onesies that are Japanese inspired, Kiku Rumi, Kiku Rumi.
1733740	1734740	That's it.
1734740	1735740	OK.
1735740	1736740	It was one of those, but a dog.
1736740	1739780	And so they were going to do that again.
1739780	1744260	And they were but they were having a hard time with the costume change because you have
1744260	1747460	to get from the dog to the cook really fast.
1747460	1753420	So somebody came up with the bright idea, like, oh, I have this dog puppet that would
1753420	1755420	work great.
1755420	1757380	And it was it was perfect.
1757380	1761220	Like it literally looked like triumph, the insult comic doc.
1761220	1762540	And so the dog.
1762540	1766820	So they would just poke the dog hand out of the thing, go bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.
1766820	1769320	It was so fucking funny.
1769320	1771420	Like that's the thing about that show.
1771420	1773840	It's this movie is like thirty five years old.
1773840	1775800	It's getting really old, OK?
1775800	1779820	But like, it's still so funny every time I watch it.
1779820	1783100	And just these little things that we were doing with the live performance to make it
1783100	1789780	even funnier, like, you know, having a dude play a vet and having, you know, a puppet
1789780	1795140	dog play the barking dogs that scare Mr. Body were just were just great.
1795140	1798180	And I have to really compliment the person I'm sorry, I will get to video games.
1798180	1801920	I just have to compliment our guy that played Mr. Body.
1801920	1809300	He was so over the top sleazeball and did so good in the role that we thought, wouldn't
1809300	1812940	it be funny if he also played the singing telegram girl?
1812940	1817020	And so he did.
1817020	1822740	And of course, played them completely different and like had these little like sparkling booty
1822740	1823740	shorts for the end.
1823740	1828500	Of course, the telegram girl scene always gets huge applause, huge applause.
1828500	1831100	But it was it was the loudest this time I've ever heard it.
1831100	1832100	It was great.
1832100	1833100	I had so much fun.
1833100	1834860	I really want them to do the show again.
1834860	1837580	But it's probably going to be a show that's on a two year cycle.
1837580	1840780	It's just it's such an ordeal to put on.
1840780	1844060	It's harder than Rocky Horror, especially from a tech perspective.
1844060	1845060	So anyway.
1845060	1846060	All right.
1846060	1849880	So as you can see, I can talk about that because that was my week, basically.
1849880	1851260	But I did try to get in some games.
1851260	1853020	I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14.
1853020	1855060	I'm still playing Death by Daylight.
1855060	1859300	Like maybe I'm not streaming a lot like Dark Sakura, but I still play quite a bit.
1859300	1861780	I still love Sadako as a killer.
1861780	1865120	I've been getting bullied on her, but I don't care.
1865120	1866980	Like I've been playing around with new builds.
1866980	1873520	I have this build I really like where you use the add on that when the survivors heal
1873520	1876940	each other, they transfer corruption to each other.
1876940	1879940	And then you use the video add ons that they gain.
1879940	1881360	That's like the ocean one, right?
1881360	1882860	That just shows her eyeball.
1882860	1885700	No, it's a no, no.
1885700	1886700	Yeah.
1886700	1887700	Yeah.
1887700	1888700	The yellow add on is that.
1888700	1889700	Yes.
1889700	1890700	So.
1890700	1891700	Yeah.
1891700	1892700	So that's a fun build.
1892700	1896680	So I like and then I just warp around to TVs to intentionally give people corruption.
1896680	1897760	And it works pretty well.
1897760	1899120	So there's that.
1899120	1902280	And then I got my survivor to 50.
1902280	1905920	I played her in Gideon's and that was an interesting experience.
1905920	1909920	I always get fucking mid which with her and I don't know what it is.
1909920	1915640	I either get the corn actually, I've only had the corn with her.
1915640	1920720	And then I had Gideon's and that was actually pretty funny and Gideon's because you can
1920720	1923080	use it to go upstairs and downstairs quickly.
1923080	1924520	The Yeah.
1924520	1925960	Is that is that the saw map?
1925960	1926960	Is that the same thing?
1926960	1927960	Yeah.
1927960	1928960	The game?
1928960	1929960	Okay.
1929960	1930960	Yeah.
1930960	1931960	Yeah.
1931960	1932960	Yeah.
1932960	1933960	Yeah.
1933960	1934960	Because I was about to say that.
1934960	1935960	Yeah.
1935960	1936960	Okay.
1936960	1937960	Yeah.
1937960	1938960	So yeah.
1938960	1939960	Kind of makes me miss Hawkins a little bit.
1939960	1940960	The only other game that I really played a little bit of and I didn't actually play the
1940960	1941960	game.
1941960	1942960	I played the demo.
1942960	1943960	So full disclosure.
1943960	1944960	I played the stranger paradise final fantasy demo.
1944960	1945960	Finally.
1945960	1946960	Like I was like, Oh, I need to get around.
1946960	1947960	I played this.
1947960	1949840	I downloaded it on series X and I played it.
1949840	1953400	And I got to admit the first five minutes, 10 minutes when I was going through the tutorial,
1953400	1955840	I was like, I hate this.
1955840	1957360	I really hate this.
1957360	1963080	Like I do not like this at all, but like, and it's something about the battles where
1963080	1965280	I'm just like this battle is yeah.
1965280	1968320	It's DJ Rama S says in chat, the controls are God awful.
1968320	1970280	Yes, they are.
1970280	1975840	But when I was able to get away from playing the swords class and play the, I don't know
1975840	1978600	if it's supposed to be like the pugilist or whatever, but you basically have the double
1978600	1981240	knives much better.
1981240	1986140	And then I got the mage unlocked much, much better playing that.
1986140	1988200	So I did have fun playing the other jobs.
1988200	1990440	So I haven't gotten the whole way through the demo yet somehow.
1990440	1992740	I know I've just been playing like a little bit.
1992740	1996960	I still don't love the battles, but I'm trying to see if it grows on me.
1996960	2002040	I don't think it's going to $60 grow on me, but I think it might like $40 grow on me.
2002040	2003320	We'll see.
2003320	2005960	Quest Buster says Rob hates chaos.
2005960	2007020	Okay.
2007020	2011560	When those that have played the full game, tell me, is the demo literally the opening
2011560	2013380	of the full game?
2013380	2019220	Because like there's these things where he's just like, I swear to God, this is the plot.
2019220	2021660	I got to kill chaos.
2021660	2026660	I don't know why, but I just woke up and I had a vision that I have to kill chaos.
2026660	2027660	What?
2027660	2029140	You guys have to kill chaos too?
2029140	2033260	Then we got to go kill chaos together.
2033260	2036100	Like that is literally the plot of the game.
2036100	2039480	And I'm like, is, is that like all the exposition you actually get?
2039480	2045720	Because in some ways, like how fucking terrible, but in other ways it's like, it's so bad.
2045720	2046780	It's kind of good.
2046780	2054860	I'm like, is this a cleverly written parody about the story in 1980s video games and how
2054860	2057700	there wasn't a lot of expedition exposition?
2057700	2060020	And why are we killing this bad guy?
2060020	2065980	Just because we feel like we have to bio shock twist, like what spoiler alert for a decade
2065980	2066980	old game?
2066980	2069740	Like what, what, what is going on here?
2069740	2075500	Like Bobby Black Wolf says, I mean, it is a retelling of final fantasy one.
2075500	2081140	I thought, yeah, that's why I was like, okay, is this just like a clever commentary on what
2081140	2085060	we were told to do in video games in 1987?
2085060	2088980	Fifth Dream in chat says, Rob just summed up 90% of the reviews of this game.
2088980	2089980	It's terrible.
2089980	2090980	It's great.
2090980	2094240	Wait, what is it?
2094240	2098720	Final fantasy origins, straight strangers of paradise.
2098720	2099880	Oh that.
2099880	2100880	Yeah.
2100880	2101880	Yeah.
2101880	2102880	I don't even know the actual name.
2102880	2103880	Yes.
2103880	2108960	It's team it's made by team Ninja because I was ready to say, Oh, this is very clearly
2108960	2113440	done in final fantasy 15s engine, but I guess not because team Ninja did it and I don't
2113440	2114820	know why they would have that engine.
2114820	2118420	So I was like expect better of team Ninja.
2118420	2119420	Do we though?
2119420	2121240	Cause sometimes they miss the mark there.
2121240	2124040	A lot of people really hated Metroid other M too.
2124040	2127800	I didn't hate it as much as other people did, but I feel like team Ninja does some
2127800	2129800	controversial stuff sometimes.
2129800	2134640	So so let's see quest Buster and expect better of them.
2134640	2138080	Quest Buster and chat says Rob's take is pretty accurate from the streamers.
2138080	2139440	I've watched play the game.
2139440	2142160	The story is whacked, but this gameplay is really good.
2142160	2147060	I will say I saw a cut scene like spoiler alert, but is it really when the story is
2147060	2148060	like this?
2148060	2153980	Is it really like I saw this cut scene where like this boss is trying to introduce them
2153980	2154980	himself.
2154980	2158180	And he's like, I am lick the God of chaos.
2158180	2162420	And the guy goes, I don't give a fuck who you are and jumps up and tries to punch him
2162420	2163420	in the face.
2163420	2165900	And then gets like bunched back.
2165900	2170300	And I'm like, this is so ridiculous.
2170300	2173700	Like I just, that would totally be me as a hero.
2173700	2177020	It's like, did I ask who you were?
2177020	2178020	I don't care.
2178020	2179020	Get them away.
2179020	2183480	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I just, Bobby Blackwell says, I just felt because I never played a
2183480	2184480	souls game.
2184480	2186080	I wasn't feeling the gameplay.
2186080	2187080	Good news.
2187080	2189400	There's a full on Bobby Blackwell mode.
2189400	2194160	Like there's not only like casual difficulty, which is what I'm playing on, but then there's
2194160	2199680	like easy casual on top of that, which I didn't even turn on, but Bobby, you could, and nobody's
2199680	2200680	going to judge you.
2200680	2201680	Nobody's going to know.
2201680	2207680	Um, where like you just, you don't even like, I think your, your, uh, counter your, uh,
2207680	2210400	party members never die in that mode.
2210400	2211400	So yeah.
2211400	2212400	Yeah.
2212400	2213840	Oh, Bobby says it plays like a souls game.
2213840	2214840	Yeah.
2214840	2215840	It still does.
2215840	2216840	It still does.
2216840	2217840	I'll do that.
2217840	2218840	Dark soccer.
2218840	2219840	I, the demos free.
2219840	2222720	You might want to consider just giving it a go for the laughs.
2222720	2224600	Um, uh, oh wait.
2224600	2225600	Oh shit.
2225600	2226600	Yeah.
2226600	2228320	You don't have a PS five or an Xbox series X, huh?
2228320	2231320	And I don't think it's not, it's probably not on Stadia.
2231320	2233620	I think it is on PC, but not Stadia.
2233620	2239640	So I'll look at Stadia and there's actually a big, um, petition out to try to get, uh,
2239640	2242600	um, Elden ring on, uh, on Stadia.
2242600	2249680	I saw that and I would have signed it except I don't sign anything from change.org because
2249680	2255940	once you do it, you get 50,000 fucking emails from them and you have to like unsubscribe
2255940	2257760	several times before they'll believe you.
2257760	2258760	Yeah.
2258760	2262440	The mailing list sacred Jade and chat says squares, triple a game quality has suffered
2262440	2263720	a lot in the last few years.
2263720	2264720	I'm not going to disagree.
2264720	2268960	I do want to remind this is, this is really a team Ninja game under, you know, but ultimately
2268960	2271480	I guess square really kind of publishes it.
2271480	2278200	Um, however, I choke about GP, which I think was on our list for last week when we didn't
2278200	2279200	get around to it.
2279200	2282320	Obviously choke about GP has not been faring so great either.
2282320	2285280	And a lot of it has to do with the way they built the microtransaction system in that
2285280	2286920	game, which is a little bit poopy.
2286920	2287920	Caca.
2287920	2292840	So, um, yeah, I did play, I would have talked about that during my gaming week last week
2292840	2295280	because I did play the demo for that.
2295280	2298160	I wasn't convinced to buy the full game.
2298160	2304000	And that really says something considering like I loved chocobo racing on PS one.
2304000	2305340	I'll defend that game.
2305340	2310060	And honestly playing chocobo GP made me go, okay, is this a Rose colored glasses thing?
2310060	2311560	It has to be right.
2311560	2313560	I don't know.
2313560	2314560	Anyway.
2314560	2315560	All right.
2315560	2316980	That was it for our gaming weeks.
2316980	2318560	Let's move on and get, okay.
2318560	2320240	Mike deaf says you're not the only one Rob.
2320240	2321240	Yeah.
2321240	2323200	So I know there's, there's other people that feel the same way I do.
2323200	2324200	It's just very disappointing.
2324200	2325200	All right.
2325200	2328440	We have more gaming news to get into because we missed the news last week.
2328440	2329480	Let's get into it.
2329480	2330960	What is going on in the gaming world?
2330960	2331960	Loki?
2331960	2337320	Well, since you were speaking about chocobo GP, uh, let's talk about Gran Turismo seven,
2337320	2343160	which also has horrible, um, microtransactions in their game.
2343160	2347880	And so because of that, people aren't happy that a lot of the cars are only available
2347880	2352060	if you purchase them through, um, this store.
2352060	2357420	And apparently you can grind the currency in game, but obviously they made it really
2357420	2362300	grindy because they want you to buy the currency, the buy it, you know?
2362300	2371700	Uh, so the, the game has a score of 2.5 on Metacritic and, uh, obviously it's kind of
2371700	2380300	getting back up, but you know, the point is that it's, uh, it's unnecessarily grindy.
2380300	2384260	There's no very, not a lot of variation in the races.
2384260	2387140	And it's just unfortunate that they don't get to have all the cars.
2387140	2390300	That's why, I mean, like, was it not even like a week ago, there was a report about
2390300	2398020	folks, um, creating a like script in like you, if you play remote play on your PC, there's
2398020	2402420	a script that you can run that basically AFK grinds it for you.
2402420	2404500	And that, you know, Sony wasn't happy about that.
2404500	2407180	Well, don't make your games a damn grindy then.
2407260	2413540	Um, and Sony apparently, or I should say polyphony, uh, digital will actually update the PlayStation
2413540	2416060	four and PlayStation five versions of the game.
2416340	2422580	Um, thanks to fan feedback, they've also given out 1 million free credits to each player.
2422580	2424140	That's been affected by that.
2424620	2430140	Um, and basically said, no, Hey, thank you for the continued support and feedback on
2430140	2431060	grantor was seven.
2431060	2433060	Your voices have not gone unheard.
2433580	2439700	Um, and they would apologize for the frustration and confusion it caused by their patch, uh,
2439700	2445020	last week or last updates, which resulted in, oh, and I forgot to mention another reason
2445020	2446660	probably why that's been review bombed.
2447060	2453220	It's, um, a game that has to be connected online all the time, even in single player.
2453420	2460140	And so it was unplayable for a few days because Sony's services were down thanks to a DDoS
2460140	2460620	attack.
2461180	2466700	Um, and so, you know, not only was there the service outage, but they're adjusting the
2466700	2472460	in-game economy, um, or they made adjustments to the in-game economy, which would made without
2472460	2473220	clear explanation.
2473220	2474980	So did they make it worse with a patch?
2475460	2477340	Um, I don't know.
2477340	2482620	That sounds horrible, but they're going to be doing a lot of different things to fix it.
2482660	2487140	I just don't understand how they didn't know this was happening.
2487220	2490060	Also, this was a game they charged $70 for on PlayStation five.
2490100	2490900	So, you know,
2492740	2496420	the whole money grabbing thing is disgusting.
2497140	2498940	What happened to just making a game?
2499340	2500580	Uh, Fortnite happened.
2501460	2505180	And what I mean by that is that this is, this is loot box 2022.
2505260	2507180	Now it's the season passes.
2507380	2508260	It was rhetorical.
2508300	2510260	But, but it's, it's worse though.
2510260	2514500	And then I get it that Fortnite happened in Fortnite is a free to play game.
2514620	2518540	The problem is these guys want, you know, money on both ends.
2518620	2521900	You know, usually it used to be like, Hey, you pay for a game up front.
2522260	2526580	You get the full game and that's that, or you have a free to play game and there's
2526580	2530500	microtransactions in it because obviously they need money in order to run the game.
2530740	2536580	But now these AAA studios figured out, Hey, we can, we can basically charge up
2536580	2541860	front for this game and we can also charge microtransactions for additional things.
2542220	2546660	Or, Hey, we can do this and we can design a game that be even grindier than it needs
2546660	2553540	to be to push people into the microtransactions it's just, it's greed
2553620	2557460	and, and it will eventually, you know, bite them in the butt, but
2557460	2559260	well, it is look at the reception here.
2559260	2562540	Look at the reception with chocobo GP, how many, like how many
2562540	2563900	thousands of copies of this thing?
2563900	2566580	I mean, they it's, it's chocobo GP.
2566580	2569180	Like, I don't, no, one's learning a lesson.
2569180	2571580	All they've learned is to like dial it back a little bit.
2571780	2574500	You know, we'll just, we'll push it until they start complaining.
2574500	2575300	We'll dial it back.
2575300	2578540	They'll look at, Oh, look at how much better this game is because they dial it
2578540	2580380	back and then they slowly move it back up again.
2581980	2586100	You know, what's interesting, you know, a game that gets away with this charging for
2586100	2588820	the game and then charge pay a debit daylight.
2589380	2590140	It does it.
2590180	2592300	They have their, their season passes in there.
2592820	2596180	I think maybe part of the reason they're able to get away with it is twofold.
2596220	2599620	One, even though, yes, it is like a $20 game.
2599660	2604180	It's a $20 game, so it's not 60, but they also, they give it away so often.
2604260	2606300	Like it was an Epic giveaway recently.
2606300	2607700	It's on Xbox game pass.
2607900	2608900	So they give it all away.
2609500	2609940	Awesome.
2609940	2613020	They give it away because they make most of their money in microtransactions.
2613020	2613540	Exactly.
2613540	2619300	No, but the other thing too, though, is that when you buy the, the season, you,
2619460	2624060	it's not like you have to renew it and you don't have to buy it to get full
2624060	2625140	enjoyment out of the game.
2626060	2626660	That's true.
2626660	2628580	You don't have to, it's, it's cosmic.
2628620	2630380	It really is cosmetics only.
2630460	2632500	They don't get any of the content behind it.
2632500	2633620	So I guess maybe there is that.
2633660	2640500	I'm referring to buying killers and survivors, which now survivors cosmetic,
2640500	2643380	except for some of them are noisy than others, Jill Valentine.
2643420	2644020	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
2644060	2649340	Um, but I mean, I think the only actual value you get of buying anybody is going
2649340	2651540	to be for the killers because the killers are all going to have different power
2651540	2657300	sets, but then, you know, there's me who is a fashion whore and the only reason
2657300	2662540	that my survivors exist is for, to put pretty clothes on them and I will, I'll
2662540	2663260	buy outfits.
2663260	2665140	I am, I am part of the problem in that.
2667020	2670500	Well, I was going to say too, I'm like certain survivor talents are kind of
2670500	2675380	mandatory, but the, the, the one that is like, you can get them in the shrine
2675380	2679740	sometimes, sometimes rarely if you're lucky, but I was going to say bill borrow
2679740	2683580	time is the only one I think of that's like a mandatory talent and bill out of
2683580	2688020	the, um, out of the store, the shrine during the five-year anniversary event.
2688020	2690260	So it's available like one week out of the year.
2690340	2691340	No, I got it before that.
2691740	2694580	And, and, and Dead Hard was available that way too.
2695420	2698900	So, and to go back to like the, the Gran Turismo 7 thing.
2698900	2703900	So here's the other shady thing about it is they altered the microtransactions
2703900	2707020	and how grindy it was after the reviews came out.
2707900	2712500	Yeah, that's the other thing is that you've, a lot of the, that Chocobo GP
2712500	2715220	had that too, not to keep harping on that, but it is a recent example.
2715420	2719020	A lot of that didn't show itself until after the reviews were coming out.
2720020	2724020	You can't trust reviews anymore and not the reviewer's fault for a change.
2724020	2725420	It's not that you can trust reviews.
2725420	2728140	Yeah, you just can't trust AAA studios anymore.
2728140	2728620	Yeah.
2729620	2730140	Anyway.
2730500	2735420	Well, speaking of changes, um, another game is having some controversial
2735420	2736980	changes, but of a different sort.
2737260	2740980	Um, this is Pokemon Go, which, you know, I've talked about, I've played quite
2740980	2744620	a bit and, um, I just, I actually went on an hour walk today and I played a
2744620	2746140	bit of Pokemon Go while I was out.
2746580	2752580	Um, and, um, yeah, Pokemon Go talked about this week, their latest community day.
2753020	2755820	Uh, community day is coming back for April.
2755820	2758460	It's been around this whole time, even during the pandemic.
2758740	2762340	Um, but they're doing the stuffle is the Pokemon that's coming out.
2762580	2767140	This is new because this is the first time they're doing a community day for
2767140	2769300	a Pokemon that has yet to be released.
2769500	2773180	So, you know, they're just now getting into the, um, Alolan Pokemon,
2773500	2775620	the Pokemon from a Pokemon X and Y.
2775740	2778180	So this will be stuffles debut in the game.
2778220	2779860	And it's a very cute little pink bear.
2779860	2782020	So a lot of people want to get it fine.
2782260	2787100	I think a lot of people are excited about the choice, but with this, they are
2787100	2793020	reverting community days back to three hours, community days used to be a six
2793020	2795060	hour window during the pandemic.
2795300	2799300	And now they are reverting as they have started to revert other pre pandemic
2799300	2803620	change or other pandemic changes back to their pre pandemic state.
2804100	2806100	Um, there are other things that they have done.
2806140	2809620	Uh, the incense change has been highly controversial.
2809860	2813940	Uh, what happened during the pandemic, they made incense change so that you
2813940	2818660	would get one Pokemon a minute, and now it's back to a Pokemon every five minutes.
2819300	2822100	What I notice a lot of people don't report on with that.
2822100	2826100	And I think to be fair to Niantic, that's if you're stationary.
2826740	2829620	If you're moving, you spawn way more of them.
2830260	2834260	So you do have to be moving and the incense will, and not everybody's
2834260	2834900	reporting that.
2834900	2838260	And I think, you know, no matter how you feel about the issue, you got to
2838260	2839700	debate it with all the facts.
2839700	2841620	And so they do spawn more if you're moving.
2842340	2846900	Um, and then of course the, the change in the hours for Pokemon go community
2846900	2849140	day is not very popular.
2849140	2853220	Um, you know, I don't like it when a community day is a Sundays from two to
2853220	2856580	five, cause then I can't really do them because of this show.
2856580	2861460	Um, so, you know, the whole point is just to squeeze people into buying
2861460	2862580	microtransactions.
2862580	2868100	That's what it is because they're trying to feed the FOMO of these players that
2868100	2869140	want this thing.
2869140	2872900	And they're like, well, there's not a lot of time, you know, to get all the
2872900	2873780	Pokemon that you want.
2873780	2877700	So they're going to try to push you into the incense and push you into whatever
2877700	2881780	that you want to, you know, pay for to be able to get it quicker.
2881780	2883860	And so that's really what it is.
2884100	2888100	They're squeezing players for more money because they're probably not making as
2888100	2888980	much money.
2888980	2893380	Now that people have gone back to work and are, you know, doing that type of
2893380	2893700	stuff.
2893700	2897460	And so I had a great solution to that.
2897460	2898340	I just stopped playing.
2900660	2901140	Yeah.
2901140	2904660	Ultimately, if you're that upset about it, that's the only thing that's going to
2904660	2906580	talk is to stop playing.
2906580	2911780	Um, I, I, I just, yeah, I, I don't love the three hour windows.
2911780	2913060	I also don't love that.
2913060	2918100	They're trying to say, are players voice that this is what they want to happen
2918100	2922100	because this is to get everybody out in the community together and all this.
2922100	2924900	And I'm just kind of like shifting blame to somebody else.
2924900	2925700	You're sorry.
2925700	2927780	I, I would, I would agree.
2927780	2930580	You mean people who work for Niantic that also play the game?
2931220	2938180	I would, I would agree with the part of the statistic where probably people were
2938180	2942740	only playing for three hours during that six hour window, but they were playing at
2942740	2944420	a time that worked for them.
2945060	2946260	And what's it going to hurt?
2946260	2947060	Who cares?
2947060	2947620	Yeah.
2947620	2948660	What's it hurting then?
2949620	2951700	Like you're not like flipping a server.
2951700	2954980	You're not popping on another server or something like that to get this Pokemon
2954980	2955220	out.
2955220	2956980	It's just, it's a thing in a game.
2956980	2958660	You're flipping a digital switch.
2959460	2964340	You're, you're doing this to push people into microtransactions.
2964340	2966340	That is why you're shortening the window.
2966900	2971060	In my opinion, every community day should be modeled after what they do in December,
2971060	2976100	where it's all weekend long that you have the increased spawn and then maybe your triple
2976100	2980020	XP and Stardust and those sorts of bonuses are limited to a window.
2980020	2980740	Fine.
2980740	2985860	But at least the people aren't missing out on the Pokemon or worse, the special move
2985860	2989780	that Pokemon only get during those times because they can't play during a certain window.
2989780	2992340	I think there's gotta be an answer in there somewhere.
2992340	2994260	Now, as far as the incense things goes,
2995220	3000580	I think Niantic's biggest issue there was with communication because playing other big
3000580	3001380	shock, right?
3001380	3006500	Because playing other Niantic games like Ingress, there's been a very different tone to the
3006500	3008740	communications about the pandemic changes.
3008740	3013380	And that is that every three months or every month, even they're coming out and saying
3013380	3018740	on a quarterly basis, we are reviewing these changes and we will re look and see when we're
3018740	3020420	going to reverse these basically.
3020420	3023060	And they basically list out this, this, this, and this.
3023620	3028340	So they what they've done differently, in my opinion, is they have never set an expectation
3028340	3030420	that these changes are going to be permanent.
3030420	3034820	When they did these changes and Pokemon go much different tone, they set the expectation
3034820	3036260	these changes will be permanent.
3036260	3038900	And now the fan base is holding them accountable for that.
3038900	3041060	Whereas an Ingress, they would be permanent.
3041060	3042580	They never got that impression.
3042580	3048020	Yeah, they said they said it in that original when I remember because it was the 80 meter
3048020	3052340	distance thing specifically and they got called the fuck out on that and they had to revert
3052340	3052980	it back.
3052980	3053620	It was that.
3054660	3061220	So with the with the whole incense thing, I understand that Niantic's whole thing is
3061220	3066180	they are trying to build games where you need to go out in the real world and explore parks,
3066180	3068020	explore areas and all this stuff.
3068580	3072740	So I get why they're doing that type of change.
3072740	3077300	I think they should have communicated a lot sooner and a lot better that these changes
3077300	3078340	were always temporary.
3078900	3085780	However, and this is a big however, there's still a larger conversation to be had about
3085780	3093380	map in that game, the map updates and how Pokemon spawn, because I'm pretty sure how
3093380	3101300	the Pokemon spawn is based off of an Ingress algorithm about how the Ingress XM spawns.
3101300	3108980	I'm almost positive Pokemon spawn more more densely in areas that are densely populated
3108980	3114660	with XM and Ingress, which is populated off of map data that is 10 years old.
3115540	3122180	It's as old as the I am not talking about what the lines on the ground look like with
3122180	3123860	the streets and everything.
3123860	3128740	That's old, too, because that all comes off the open street map and Pokemon Go pulls that
3128740	3130100	maybe once a year.
3130820	3136180	All I know is that the park closest to where I live now doesn't exist in Pokemon Go.
3136180	3139540	And that park has existed in open street maps for like two years.
3140180	3145700	So I think Pokemon needs to be pulling in map data a little more frequently, but including
3145700	3146580	the spawn points.
3146580	3151460	What I'm trying to get to with Ingress is that like the population data that drives
3151460	3155060	the score in Ingress has not been updated in 10 years.
3156020	3161620	So, for example, a neighborhood here in the Sacramento area, Anatolia, you guys would
3161620	3162260	know where that is.
3162260	3165220	That's a new development out like sunrise and 50.
3165220	3165940	Okay.
3165940	3173300	If you were to field all of Anatolia, you'll get maybe 30 MU, meaning the map data thinks
3173300	3177860	that 30 people live in that area, because when it was rural, there probably were 30
3177860	3179380	people that lived in that area.
3179380	3182260	But now there are thousands of people that live in that area.
3182900	3187860	I'm illustrating that because that is the old map data that's causing Pokemon spawns
3187860	3189380	to be stupid as well.
3189380	3195460	And so I think Niantic needs to solve this problem of more regular map updates so that
3195460	3200900	people feel like they're not seeing Pokemon when they go out and walk around, which is
3200900	3201620	a very real issue.
3201620	3204820	Anatolia has been there for like, how many years now?
3205460	3207460	A part of it has, but it's gotten bigger.
3207460	3208580	In at least like 5 to 10 years.
3208580	3210580	Yeah, but it's gotten a lot bigger too.
3211300	3217060	But Ingress is a 10 year old game, and that population data has literally never been updated.
3217700	3222580	So Mike Def says the map actually got updated recently, but it's an area by area basis,
3222580	3224260	but not the part I'm talking about.
3225140	3230420	If you play Ingress and field new areas, you'll know exactly what I mean.
3230420	3235300	And I'm telling you, everything that powers Pokemon go came out of Ingress.
3236100	3240180	So there's one for one there.
3240260	3247780	So anyway, SSG100Matt says there are times where Niantic gets on a moral high horse.
3247780	3251620	They really want to stand on this high ground that our game is about moving around and we
3251620	3254580	want to reward you for the moving around because exercise.
3254580	3258340	Same thing happened when they cut the stop gym distance and they got rid of the 80 meter
3258340	3258980	radius.
3258980	3261380	People got upset about that and they had to reverse it.
3262340	3264500	What does that say for people with disabilities?
3264500	3266820	It's that people with disabilities can't move.
3267700	3268020	Ever.
3270420	3275780	Yeah, they're completely excluding an entire group of players who were probably thriving
3275780	3278980	on having the COVID restrictions because it put them on more equal footing with other
3278980	3279380	players.
3280180	3284340	I would argue that there are a lot of games that exclude.
3284340	3286180	I mean, what if somebody is blind?
3286180	3290260	What if somebody is, you know, we've talked to people on this show that can't play certain
3290260	3291700	games because they're blind.
3291700	3296740	It is very hard to make a game that is accessible to 100% of the population.
3296820	3298660	And it sucks.
3298660	3303860	But that's, you know, and so the more we can do to make games accessible, then great.
3303860	3308660	But I understand that the backbone of the game is being out and moving around and plenty
3308660	3313380	of differently abled people can still get out and move around unless you are completely
3313380	3316500	in a bedridden type of situation.
3318020	3323380	But I think it's interesting that there isn't like an offline version of Pokemon Go because
3323380	3326180	I would have thought they would have made a lot of money off of that at this point.
3326180	3329380	But to be determined, I suppose.
3330820	3334820	SG100 Mountain Chat says having six hour community days doesn't break the game.
3334820	3338100	Having certain shiny rates at specific times doesn't break the game.
3338100	3339780	Just be flexible with the community.
3339780	3341140	That's all folks are asking.
3342260	3347060	Yeah, I think that there should be a little more choice into, like, when you want to play
3347060	3348180	that three hour window.
3348180	3354260	And we know they can do phased events because that's what powers these virtual
3356580	3358020	Go Fest and things like that.
3358580	3360340	So anyway.
3361060	3365380	All right, let's move on and talk about other old school franchises.
3365380	3366020	Dark Sakura.
3367620	3372340	Well, I'm sure that people who know their video game history are going to know what
3372340	3374020	Colossal Cave Adventure is, right?
3374740	3385700	It was a 1976 text adventure game, and it's actually being ported to a VR version by the
3385700	3387140	founders of Sierra.
3387140	3389780	That's Roberta and Ken Williams.
3390820	3394260	They're doing this basically.
3394980	3399860	Now, again, these are also the people that made, you know, King's Quest and Phantasmagoria,
3399860	3405780	you know, basically like just the classics of our early gaming.
3405780	3415860	But they're wanting to do a kind of like a real walking through adventure.
3417620	3424260	Their new company is Cygnus Entertainment, and they have 12 full time employees working
3424260	3429620	on the game, and they're not sure if they're going to do future games under Cygnus or if
3429620	3436180	it's just going to be Colossal Cave 3D as the one, you know, the one time attempt.
3436180	3443380	But looking at the trailer for it, it's actually really, really pretty.
3444980	3451620	And it has like different elements from, you know, from the text adventure, but you're
3451620	3454820	going around and actually working on it.
3454820	3457060	So I think it's pretty, pretty neat.
3457860	3460420	Now, I can't do VR at all.
3460420	3462100	I mean, I could, but I will not.
3463220	3468740	But looking at the trailer for it, it really seems like it's going to be, you know, just
3468740	3470340	a complete full circle.
3473140	3479140	You know, they've actually got on this thing that I'm reading, they're actually showing
3479140	3486500	the text adventure running on a PDP, an old computer anyway.
3487140	3492900	I don't remember the full model of it, but it's really just come a long way.
3493460	3495540	I think that it's really awesome that they're doing that.
3497060	3504740	Yeah, it's interesting because, you know, I get VR, like I have enjoyed it, you know,
3504740	3509620	with things like Beat Saber, but I think there's a lot of VR stuff that just feels kind of
3510260	3513620	like they're just shoving it in there because VR is like the cool new kid on the block.
3514340	3518580	That being said, I'm very curious for Ken and Roberta Williams take on this because,
3518580	3521860	again, these are folks that have been out of the industry for some time and been out
3521860	3524500	traveling the world until they couldn't do that anymore.
3524500	3529860	So I feel like it's an interesting, refreshing new take on this.
3529860	3534100	And for whatever reason, they really feel like, you know, VR is the path for their game.
3534100	3538180	And so it's interesting because it's a new take from a familiar place.
3538180	3542980	And, you know, Ken and Roberta Williams were the very first that did a graphical
3543940	3547300	the murder, I can't remember the name of the game, Murder House or whatever it was called.
3547300	3552420	That first game that they did was like the first mystery house, the first graphical
3552420	3554820	game that there was in an adventure sense.
3555620	3558740	So it'd be interesting to see what their take is on VR.
3558740	3559860	Mystery Quest.
3559860	3560740	Mystery Quest?
3560740	3562180	I thought it was something about a house.
3562180	3563220	OK, but that's whatever.
3564180	3568820	Well, there's also Mystery House, which is that current game that's out or Murder House
3568820	3569460	or whatever.
3569460	3573300	Yeah, that's it's like meant to look like an old ass game.
3573300	3573620	Yeah.
3573620	3574420	Yeah.
3574420	3577780	So so I'm curious to see their take.
3577780	3581140	Sierra also published like Leisure Suit Larry and Half Life.
3581140	3582260	So I mean, yeah.
3583860	3584500	Mystery House.
3584500	3586500	OK, that was at the first Sierra game in 1980.
3586500	3589540	OK, that was that was the one where it was like in the first like graphics.
3589540	3594180	And I think Ken programmed it and Roberto wrote it, if I'm not mistaking.
3594180	3596740	So, yeah, kind of anyway.
3596740	3600980	But my point is, I'm just curious to see what, you know, grandpas take.
3600980	3602900	And I mean that as a compliment.
3602900	3604980	Their take on this is for VR.
3604980	3609380	The only problem is I'm not buying an Oculus device to play it.
3609380	3613540	So I'll just have to hear about it through others and see, you know, the footage and
3613540	3616340	things like that or maybe play when I go to a friend's house.
3616340	3616820	I don't know.
3616820	3624660	But I it's going to take me a lot, a lot to support Metta and the VR thing.
3624660	3626820	I really don't want to be bothered with it.
3626820	3631060	So as long as that game remains exclusive to that, I guess I just have to hear about
3631060	3631700	it second hand.
3632340	3632840	So.
3634100	3634660	All right.
3634660	3635220	Anyway.
3635220	3635460	Yeah.
3635460	3637860	And Bobby says nobody's buying an Oculus device now.
3637860	3639300	They're Metta devices.
3639300	3639780	Yeah.
3639780	3641380	But we all know how I feel about.
3642740	3645460	Do I believe that company deserves to be called that?
3645460	3649460	You know, I'm going to they're lucky I talk about them at all, to be quite honest.
3650180	3650500	All right.
3651300	3652260	Moving on.
3652260	3654180	Something something a little different.
3654180	3654680	Logie.
3655860	3657780	Yeah, we're never going to call them that.
3657780	3658260	Sorry.
3658260	3659540	You know, that's just the way it is.
3661380	3661880	So.
3663060	3668740	Cyberpunk was a game that's been kind of rocky and they've been patching it and stuff.
3668740	3670820	But now that cyberpunk is kind of.
3673700	3677700	In like kind of a holding pattern right now, it's time to start thinking about the next
3677700	3683700	Witcher game and CD Projekt Red has actually teased that there is the Witcher a new saga
3683700	3690500	begins that's being worked on on Unreal five as opposed to their own red engine.
3691140	3698580	And you know, it's not necessarily they haven't really just said when it's coming out or
3698580	3700740	any details aside from a brief teaser.
3700740	3707540	But we do know that they have promised pinky promised that they're not going to be crunching
3707540	3712420	this time, despite the fact that last time they crunched.
3712420	3716740	So they're promising, though, that they're not going to crunch their teams, but.
3718900	3720980	It's coming at some point.
3722660	3728340	I also find the news about their switch to Unreal five kind of interesting is it's
3728340	3731140	kind of like, are they trying to say that?
3731140	3735700	Because I feel like there's almost a similar battle going on at EA and the Frostbite engine.
3735700	3739540	And like, you know, more companies are starting to be like, and maybe we should walk away
3739540	3743940	from our proprietary engines and just go with the industry standard unreal because it keeps
3743940	3744820	games on track.
3744820	3745540	You know what I mean?
3745540	3748660	Like, I guess it makes it easier to bring an outside talent to I don't know.
3748660	3751460	Yeah, it might be easier for outside talent.
3751460	3756340	You don't need to have so many, you know, designers working on the engine itself.
3756340	3762100	You can just kind of, you know, add stuff to it, but not necessarily have to design
3762100	3763220	it from scratch.
3763220	3767140	Plus, it's probably their red engine is probably getting pretty old anyways, and they're
3767140	3772500	probably getting to the point where, OK, we need to update this for what we want to do
3772500	3773300	with the Witcher.
3773300	3775860	And, you know, let's say it's a few years out or whatever.
3775860	3780580	I mean, it's just probably easier just to have somebody else working on the engine instead
3780580	3782260	of them working on the engine.
3782260	3788100	So, yeah, yeah, maybe that's what led to some of the cyberpunk issues, you know, with all
3788100	3790340	the honestly, maybe.
3790340	3795140	And that's kind of why I think that part of it is almost I mean, the news that they're
3795140	3799940	working on a new Witcher game, I mean, of course, but the news is going to be unreal
3799940	3800420	instead.
3800420	3805380	I think that's the very interesting part out of that quest buster in chat says the medallion
3805380	3810260	buried in snow in the teaser image appears to be that of the Lynx, another Witcher school
3810260	3813620	with ties to a new world kind of continent.
3813620	3817860	So I mean, we might get a sense there, a hint about where the story is going.
3818660	3819780	It'll be interesting.
3819780	3823860	I'll also be interested to see how it might tie into the very popular Netflix series,
3823860	3828740	which, you know, obviously is to thank, I think, a little bit for a lot of the Witcher's
3828740	3829220	success.
3829220	3833780	I mean, it's been mutually beneficial, the game and the Netflix show.
3833780	3835940	And yes, I know it's all based on a book to begin with.
3836980	3838180	So it's interesting.
3838900	3845060	All right, moving on, let's talk about something that's coming back for next summer, because
3845620	3847700	last week we talked a little bit.
3847700	3853300	I know it wasn't on the podcast, but the story we did talk about was that the EA thing was
3853300	3855300	not going to be coming back next summer.
3855300	3859060	And it kind of led to a wider discussion on is E3 even going to come back?
3859060	3861460	And I'm pretty sure the answer is no at this point.
3861460	3862660	But what is going to come back?
3863380	3870420	Valve's Steam Next Fest is going to be coming on June 13th and June 20th.
3871460	3876420	And now to point out, there was just a spring version of this that just so it's not like
3876420	3881860	it's a once a year thing, but it's interesting in particular that week that they chose is
3881860	3887300	right around the time there would be an E3 type of thing and that they're already hyping
3887300	3894020	it getting underway at one o'clock Eastern on June 13th through June 20th.
3894020	3899860	They are saying hundreds of game demos will be available for folks to check out live streams
3899860	3901940	featuring teams working on titles.
3902740	3907860	But we don't know exactly what games, of course, are going to be featured as of yet.
3907860	3914100	We just know that past versions featured Sable, Toem, The Wandering Village, and so forth.
3914900	3918980	And I think this is very interesting because the story I'm looking at says the timing of
3918980	3922100	this means it will likely overlap with this year's E3.
3922100	3926900	While the Entertainment Software Association has yet to set a date for the annual conference,
3926900	3929540	it has historically taken place in early to mid June.
3930340	3932180	Well, I've got news, but it was last year.
3932180	3933940	Yeah, I've got news for the news guy.
3936260	3937780	There's not going to be an E3 this year.
3940660	3942660	I mean, sure, it's not official yet.
3943540	3945220	So I could get proven wrong.
3945220	3945620	Fine.
3945620	3950180	It wouldn't be the first time, but we're literally 10 weeks out, right?
3950180	3951380	We're coming up on April.
3951940	3956020	Next week is going to be the first week of April, and we're talking mid June, two and
3956020	3956580	a half months.
3958020	3959460	There's not going to be any three this year.
3959460	3959960	Come on.
3960660	3962980	And now EA just canceled their event.
3962980	3963860	Why did they do that?
3964820	3966420	There's not going to be any three next to it.
3968660	3971940	Anyway, let's move on to our Sacro.
3972660	3978820	Well, you know, April is also, you know, my entire birthday.
3980260	3981620	It took a whole month for me to be born.
3981620	3984020	The entire month is how we celebrate your birthday.
3984020	3986420	Yes, you make it extend for the whole period.
3986420	3986920	Yes.
3987700	3996820	So as reported by the New York Times, Netflix is buying another video game studio to expand
3996820	4000340	their own fledgling video game services.
4001060	4007060	They announced this past Thursday that they were buying Boss Fight Entertainment.
4007700	4010100	It's a small studio based in Allen, Texas.
4011940	4018820	They are a mobile game developer with 130 employees, and they also have bought one called
4018820	4024820	Night School in September, and they also bought Next Games.
4024820	4026420	They didn't say how much they paid for it.
4026980	4033460	But with bringing in all of these smaller studios, you know, a bunch of small things
4033460	4034900	can make up something pretty big.
4037300	4043060	But the thing is, is that they're having to play a major catch-up game behind Google and
4043060	4043560	Amazon.
4044100	4048500	And now, you know, Amazon Luna is, I think, still in beta.
4048500	4054820	I actually have a Luna account, but I mean, they're really trying to push into it.
4055060	4057220	We'll see what they can do.
4057220	4062900	I mean, I don't have a lot of hope at first, but then again, I love Stadia, so who knows?
4064100	4069380	Yeah, I feel like Netflix is really trying to find its place at this table.
4069380	4074580	And it's interesting because we see video games trying to find their space in the cloud.
4074580	4079220	And now we see the cloud success story in the movie department anyway, trying to find
4079220	4080420	its place in the cloud.
4080420	4086340	And I feel like that is not going so smoothly, but acquisitions like this will probably help
4086340	4087460	move them in the right direction.
4088260	4089460	So we'll see.
4090340	4094900	It's certainly interesting that this is the path that they're choosing to go as opposed
4094900	4099700	to expanding, you know, organically their own numbers.
4100580	4104020	Stu and Hunter Matt in chat says, I wonder what the next three years will look like when
4104020	4105060	Netflix games.
4105060	4107620	I wonder what the next three years are going to look like for the service.
4107620	4112500	They've been losing a lot of stuff, but they still manage to keep a lot of shows that people
4112500	4113060	are talking about.
4113060	4115380	Like what Bridgerton is kind of the big thing right now.
4115380	4118900	So a Stranger Things will be back at some point, which even I like that one.
4118900	4120500	So I don't watch a lot of TV.
4120500	4121620	I'll watch that.
4121620	4125140	So maybe they do have some things still going for it.
4125140	4125700	Pretty good.
4127380	4127880	All right.
4128820	4130260	I have a question for you.
4130260	4131620	I have a question for you.
4131860	4132360	So.
4133300	4133800	All right.
4135540	4137460	I'm still, I don't know.
4137460	4139300	I get a little bit irritated thinking about it.
4139940	4140440	How so?
4141620	4152420	Just in general, I would really, I think that, I just think that they're coming in too late
4153780	4156420	to a game, to a game, huh?
4156420	4159860	That's been pioneered by people who are better prepared for it.
4160500	4167540	I think that, and to kind of bring things back full circle, the top of the show, I think
4167540	4171940	that's a lot of concern people have about Sony and that game pass model is that they're
4171940	4175140	showing up late to a party that they should have been at a long time ago.
4175940	4176740	But I don't know.
4176740	4178100	This isn't fashionably late.
4178100	4180980	This is, oh, you're cleaning up the cheese dip.
4180980	4181480	I'm sorry.
4183140	4184980	But Bobby does make a point in chat.
4184980	4186420	It's not always about who's first.
4186420	4187540	It's about who does it the best.
4188500	4191140	That's certainly the case when it comes to a lot of stuff.
4191140	4192260	So we'll see.
4192260	4195940	I just don't know if Netflix has, I don't know.
4195940	4197940	I feel like Netflix should stick at what they're good at.
4197940	4201140	And that's original programming and canceling shows before their prime.
4202100	4207380	But anyway, all right, let's move on.
4207380	4207880	Logie.
4209300	4212260	So this is kind of interesting.
4212260	4220900	There's been some folks, Harbor Masters, who are developers that designed a kind of a weird
4220900	4224100	like shell that plays Ocarina of Time on PC.
4224660	4230580	So basically, they're trying to get around a takedown notice from Nintendo.
4231140	4236820	So what they've done is they basically fans have reverse engineered the code from Ocarina
4236820	4237700	of Time and to see.
4238340	4241300	And so they've been able to port it to the PC.
4241300	4243700	But in order to play this, you actually have to have us.
4243700	4248580	It reads the code from a separate ROM file to kind of think of almost like a ROM patch
4248580	4250900	or something like that, except it's not actually patching the ROM.
4250900	4253140	It's just reading the ROM separately.
4254180	4259220	I guess I'd almost be like an emulator, but you can't include the BIOS or codes because
4259220	4260980	that's what's copyrighted type of thing.
4261620	4262260	I don't know.
4262260	4266740	But anyway, so now Ocarina of Time is available to play on PC, assuming you have the ROM
4267220	4273380	ROM, and it supports different mods as well, including like HD models, texture packs, online
4273380	4276100	play, Linux and Mac support, stuff like that.
4277460	4279300	Ultra wide, if you want to do that.
4280180	4284500	This is fascinating to me that this hasn't been yanked by Nintendo somehow yet.
4284500	4288820	And the way that I mean, yes, I completely heard what you said about how it works and
4288820	4293300	the fact that like it doesn't actually have a ROM in it so that there's no actual assets
4293300	4293940	in it.
4293940	4296660	Although wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
4296660	4299380	People know before people know where to find them.
4299380	4304900	You know, it's just it's just interesting that it creates a legal quandary for Nintendo
4304900	4306660	as to can they shut it down?
4308020	4308980	I will try.
4309540	4310660	They're probably going to try.
4310660	4314580	They're going to have to do it anyways, because they're a big company.
4314580	4317220	And if it's a small individual, what are they going to do?
4317220	4319300	Counter Sue all the money to do that.
4319300	4320740	Nintendo is a big company.
4320740	4323460	Plus, the problem is right before now it's on the Internet.
4323460	4325700	You know, and that's at the end of the day, it's on the Internet.
4325700	4326900	It's always going to be on the Internet.
4326900	4331940	When I was looking into this before, apparently you also have to have a particular version
4331940	4339700	of it where it's before it's pre Master Quest mode and also that it has to have a certain
4339700	4340500	debug version.
4342900	4345140	For some of the the current stuff to run on it.
4345140	4345860	Interesting.
4345860	4349940	I wonder, I bet here's here's the thing I'd be worried about, because I bet there's a
4349940	4351860	lot of people interested in streaming this.
4352660	4355780	I bet Nintendo yanks the shit out of those YouTube.
4355780	4357380	I don't know if they can stop Twitch.
4357380	4358500	It's a lot harder.
4358500	4359460	They could probably find a way.
4359460	4361940	I bet Nintendo starts yanking the shit out of those YouTubes.
4362500	4364260	We've seen them do that kind of thing before.
4364260	4366420	I'd be very curious to see.
4367060	4371380	So but I think but the idea is so cool.
4371940	4373860	Like I like that all that stuff aside.
4373860	4378260	I'm like, wow, playing Ocarina of Time, like on a widescreen monitor on the computer is
4378260	4379620	like, oh, I love that.
4379620	4386340	Like I it just it just makes you go, gosh, if only Nintendo could do this themselves
4386340	4393540	for their beloved games, but they don't want to take a clue from the stuff that Valve was
4393540	4399540	doing before in hiring the people who are making these these things to bring out what
4399540	4404020	what people actually want, you know, say, oh, these are talented people.
4404020	4406020	They're already making this happen.
4406020	4408900	Let's pay them to make it happen and give people what they want.
4410180	4411380	I'm going to agree with that.
4411380	4416660	I mean, I understand, you know, Nintendo being a Japanese company, probably the culture's
4416660	4417700	a little different.
4417700	4421220	And but I mean, at the end of the day, good business is good business.
4421220	4423300	And I think Valve built their business on that.
4423300	4425220	And that's why they're as successful as they are.
4425780	4428180	So now if only they could count to three.
4429860	4430360	Fair.
4431380	4431880	All right.
4432340	4436020	Well, speaking of Nintendo, lol, just Nintendo things.
4436660	4444020	Let's talk about the latest update for the switch, because there was a system software
4444020	4446100	upgrade firmware for the switch.
4446100	4454740	And it's now up to version 14.0, if you can believe it, which adds groups to the home
4454740	4455240	page.
4455940	4457060	It's a folder system.
4457620	4463540	So finally, you have a way to build folders, excuse me, groups out of all of the games
4463540	4467300	that you've accumulated on your screen, because most of you probably have so much stuff on
4467300	4467780	your switch.
4467780	4472020	Now, it doesn't fit just on one bar, you have to go to that screen where you're looking
4472020	4474020	at everything on there.
4474020	4480500	So yeah, so it's led to a lot of people commenting the lol folders late to the party.
4480500	4483780	But then at the same time, a lot of people are like, but I'm using it.
4483780	4486420	And like I organized all my games and all that stuff.
4486420	4490820	So you can make up to 100 groups and you can have up to 200 titles per group.
4490820	4494260	I can't imagine anyone's going to actually hit that number without them intentionally
4494260	4494660	trying.
4497460	4503620	Also, you can only see the all software screen if you have more than 13 software icons.
4503620	4504820	I find that interesting.
4504820	4506580	I wonder why they changed that, but okay.
4508020	4510340	Also, they've updated Bluetooth audio.
4511860	4516740	You can adjust the volume of Bluetooth audio using either the switch console or your Bluetooth
4516740	4517620	audio device.
4517860	4518820	Woohoo for that.
4520020	4523460	So that's the big Nintendo system update.
4524100	4530420	And let's see, looking in chat, Mike Def says, For fuck's sake, the Wii U does folders
4530420	4530820	better.
4531940	4536260	Sj100Matt says, We got folder and two choices of colors and themes.
4536980	4540020	Mike Def says, It's something at least, but it should have been better.
4540020	4541860	And Orange Right says, Better late than never.
4541860	4548980	I mean, can't Nintendo just change the look of the I mean, they would never do it.
4548980	4552340	I'm like, can't they just, like, really overhaul the look at the switch interface,
4552340	4553780	but they would never do it.
4554340	4557140	Only Microsoft does things that are that nutty.
4557140	4562420	Like, if you think about the 360 and, like, the radical changes the 360 interface went
4562420	4564980	through, remember the blades, the initial interface?
4564980	4565940	It wasn't that bad.
4565940	4568420	I mean, for its time, it wasn't that bad.
4568420	4570580	And then they, like, completely redid it.
4570580	4574260	It looked like a new console when they redid it around the time Kinect came out.
4575140	4575700	Something else.
4577300	4577700	All right.
4577700	4584660	Anyway, let's go back to a simpler time when we weren't so concerned with the interfaces
4584660	4586900	on the system, because there wasn't any.
4586900	4588740	You would plug in your cartridge and go.
4589780	4590420	Not this one.
4590420	4591380	You've been listening.
4591380	4592260	Not that one.
4592260	4593060	Not that button.
4594260	4595300	That's the wrong button.
4595300	4596660	That's the button that ends the show.
4598180	4598580	Let's try.
4598580	4599060	Game over.
4599060	4599380	Bye.
4600740	4602340	Let's try this button instead.
4613140	4618580	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4618580	4620900	out a classic and tell you about it.
4620900	4623540	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4623940	4630340	And yes, DarkSakura, like you were saying, this isn't really a pick tonight that is about
4632020	4633220	an old system.
4633220	4637540	In fact, this is one of those picks where I'm going, this is 10 years old.
4637540	4638260	It's honest.
4638260	4639220	It's 10 years old.
4639220	4640180	Really?
4640180	4641940	I can't handle it.
4641940	4642500	What did you pick?
4643460	4644580	I picked Mass Effect 3.
4645860	4646820	Now we've done them all.
4647460	4654500	It is almost exactly, almost exactly 10 years.
4655940	4660980	Well, I meant I would have been doing it closer to the 10 year mark, but so it came out on
4660980	4662980	March 6, 2012.
4663940	4670580	And it's a action RPG developed by Bioware published by Electronic Arts and it is the
4670580	4673780	third in the Mass Effect original trilogy.
4674500	4679700	It's the final one in that it was released for Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
4679700	4682180	PlayStation, PlayStation 3.
4682180	4688740	There was a Wii U version entitled Mass Effect 3 Special Edition released in November, 2012.
4689620	4696020	So the game is set in the Milky Way Galaxy in 2186 and the Reapers are coming.
4696740	4698580	And this time the Reapers came.
4699060	4700820	And this time the Reapers came.
4701780	4702820	You opened the box.
4703540	4704660	Sorry, wrong game.
4704660	4710900	Anyway, you can import your save file from Mass Effect 2 and keep going.
4712260	4720660	It also, instead of some of the previous things that went into Mass Effect 2, this one has
4720660	4725860	a lot more involved increasing your military strength by completing your missions, gathering
4725860	4726660	your resources.
4727220	4731540	And it does have, though, much of the similar gameplay from Mass Effect 2.
4731540	4734820	Both of those were changed from the first Mass Effect.
4736660	4740820	You know, you got your cover based shooting and the altered person, things like that.
4741780	4744580	The multiplayer component, I miss it.
4744580	4748020	I miss Mass Effect multiplayer so much.
4748020	4749540	We did a lot of that, Rob.
4751700	4752200	Remember?
4753940	4754660	Okay, Rob's gone.
4755300	4765300	Anyway, it also had a bunch of DLC and some of the DLC was, like, significantly epic.
4767140	4772420	So at any rate, yeah, and Questbuster, I agree.
4772420	4774980	Garris has never left my team because Garris.
4776740	4777300	The voice.
4779140	4781380	So moving into a little bit more about it.
4782340	4787700	So, like I said, you can import your game file for Mass Effect 2.
4788420	4801220	You can go on the Galaxy map and choose where you're going to go.
4801220	4802420	You've got different quests.
4802420	4803460	You have side quests.
4803460	4810420	You have different paths on a tree that you can unlock your skills.
4810500	4819780	You also have your biotic powers, which are going to be more like telekinesis and shields
4819780	4822100	and things like that, as long as tech powers as well.
4823540	4835060	And then there was also an app that you had that you could also contribute to your Galaxy
4835060	4835620	readiness.
4835620	4836100	Oh, my God.
4836100	4837060	I forgot about that.
4837060	4837780	That was annoying.
4838740	4842980	And I brought up earlier about multiplayer.
4843700	4847460	So I'll get back to that in a moment, because I was saying that we played a lot of multiplayer.
4848420	4850340	I love multiplayer, but continue.
4850340	4856500	Yeah, but at any rate, so you've got different modes.
4856500	4859060	You have, like, action story and RPG.
4859620	4862980	So in action mode, your conversations are all just generic replies.
4863540	4868260	Story mode, you have manual replies and minimal combat.
4868260	4872100	RPG mode, you have manual replies and normal combat.
4872100	4875540	I always just played in story mode because that's why I was playing this for the story.
4877780	4883140	At any rate, the combat is actually pretty good.
4883140	4888740	It's real time, but you can sort of have a pause to change your menu or move things around.
4889700	4894180	You are always playing as Commander Shepard, although Fem Ship is best ship.
4895940	4898980	And you can go into cover and play with different play styles.
4898980	4901940	You can melee, you can use biotics, all of that.
4901940	4904900	Now multiplayer multiplayer was the best.
4904900	4905620	It was so good.
4906820	4912900	It was called Galaxy at War, and you could have up to four players to do Horde style
4912900	4914020	cooperative matches.
4914740	4919540	And you could also get in-game currency to unlock different items.
4919540	4927220	You know, I guess loot packs, you know, they did have the in-game transactions, but you
4927220	4928180	didn't need them.
4928180	4930020	It wasn't entirely reliant on them.
4930740	4936180	And then you could also do, for the first year, there were BioWare sponsored challenges
4936180	4939300	that had special objectives and increased rewards.
4939940	4947300	And so this isn't accurate because, oh, never mind, never mind.
4948180	4952900	You can play as all kinds of different sorts of races instead of just playing as Shepard.
4954420	4958420	You remember I had my Krogan named Rex in effect after the band?
4961460	4962660	Sorry, I was muted.
4962660	4963160	Yeah.
4964020	4968100	And then my Quarian engineer was who I pretty much played all the time.
4969620	4973460	But it was just really great.
4973460	4976020	And he had fantastic voice acting in it.
4976660	4981700	You had, you know, Mark Mirren, Jennifer Hale, both amazing.
4983140	4985860	You had Kimberly Brooks's Ashley Williams.
4985860	4987300	I love listening to her voice.
4989060	4992580	And Freddie Prinze Jr. as Vega.
4994180	4995140	He was great.
4995140	4998580	I absolutely loved having him in there.
4999860	5003780	Of course, you had Seth Green as Joker, Martin Sheen as the Elusive Man.
5004980	5010180	Aria was Carrie-Anne Moss, just, ugh, what a goddess.
5010180	5012820	You had Garrus, great voice.
5013700	5019700	But, I mean, they were just like such a good, oh, and Lance Henriksen as Admiral Hackett,
5019700	5022820	like really just amazing voice actors.
5022900	5030340	So anyway, moving forward, as to the development of the game,
5033140	5039060	the co-lead writer for Mass Effect 2, Mac Walters, was lead writer for Mass Effect 3.
5039860	5046580	And they just began a short story that went over the major plot points and then moved
5046580	5047620	high level for there.
5048180	5052660	And then, you know, they just sort of worked through it very organically from what I'm
5052660	5053380	seeing on here.
5053380	5060100	And then they had the different ending sequences that, with the Reapers, they had a lot more
5060100	5061060	than what we got.
5061700	5070820	In fact, there was an idea that would have had a Shepard who had been converted by Reaper
5071540	5082580	Shepard who had been converted by Reaper Tech, or that Saren would have, who was the first
5082580	5089380	antagonist of the first Mass Effect, would have come back or something, or they would
5089380	5092980	have actually were having Shepard mimic Saren's story.
5094020	5096180	The Elusive Man was supposed to be a boss.
5096180	5096820	Did you know that?
5097620	5099700	I remember hearing that, yeah.
5099700	5101380	Which always surprised me he wasn't.
5102260	5106420	There's actually artwork of it, because I have it in one of the Mass Effect art books
5107540	5111380	that he was going to turn into this massive Reaper creature, but they scrapped that.
5112260	5118260	There is some dialogue I think is still in the code that was supposed to refer to that.
5118260	5126260	They had other ones about dark energy, that the Entropic Effect would end the universe.
5127780	5129300	So they had other things like that.
5130660	5136020	And then in November 2011, a private beta of Mass Effect 3 was leaked onto Xbox Live.
5136740	5143060	And so there were plot points that people were able to access, and it made, it forced
5143060	5144980	BioWare to change some of the story.
5146340	5152980	So it was originally designed for consoles that were heading to the end of their lifespans,
5152980	5158980	and so they worked to optimize the gameplay rather than push the technology ahead.
5159860	5168420	And then there were of course all the DLC that came out, but I'm going to actually take
5168420	5170020	a step back and talk about the music.
5171860	5180020	The music for Mass Effect 2 was a lot more orchestral, where for Mass Effect 3 is a lot
5180020	5189860	more synthesizer driven, and it ended up being the more likely choice for something
5189860	5193540	where you're heading into this perhaps technological takeover.
5194180	5202020	And they did bring back fonts, I think, for the end song for that one, that did the end
5202020	5203540	song at the first Mass Effect.
5203540	5205780	This one's one of their, they're a prog rock band.
5206340	5215540	But also moving forward, it was very heavily marketed, it was very, very looked forward
5215540	5215700	to.
5215700	5220900	They also used viral marketing with fictional blogs and a web series called BioWare Pulse.
5222420	5227860	There were early copies of Mass Effect 3 that were launched into space using weather balloons
5227860	5233860	and equipped with GPS devices, and fans could track them and recover them when they landed,
5233940	5235620	which gave them early copies of the game.
5237300	5241220	There were so many, there were just like that one leak that happened before.
5242420	5252500	And it actually, this time they promoted the male and female Shepard because FemShep has
5252500	5254580	fans, and she was there first.
5255460	5259140	And then they did another one where you could decide what she looks like, and I'm sorry,
5259140	5261380	I did not care for her face model.
5261940	5263300	It was not based on a human.
5264420	5267220	But hacking's gonna hack.
5267220	5272660	There were mod editors that you could take that makeup look and apply it to a normal
5272660	5274900	shape of face and just do all kinds of different stuff for it.
5276500	5286180	You also had different goodies for pre-orders, such as PSN ones were given the M55 Argus
5286180	5289220	assault weapon and a Mass Effect 3 PlayStation theme.
5290180	5294740	The release was scheduled for late 2011, but it was moved to March 6, 2012.
5295380	5299380	It was only released for Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
5299380	5306100	But then as it came out, there was Mass Effect 3 also, by the way, required Origin to play
5306100	5306820	on PC.
5306820	5309140	There's the Wii U version that came out.
5309140	5313620	And then since then, we've had the remaster, which is Mass Effect Legendary Edition that
5313940	5323300	came for Windows, PS4, and Xbox One, of which I can only play two and three on my Windows
5323300	5324580	11 ARM partition.
5325140	5331780	For some reason, it cannot emulate the architecture for Mass Effect 1 to run properly in it.
5332740	5335940	So anyone who's on ARM-based machines, I'm going to warn you.
5336500	5339300	So there was DLC, and there was great DLC.
5340100	5342660	So the first one was okay.
5342740	5345780	Oh, and by the way, by the way, let's rewind back.
5345780	5346740	Actually, we're not going to do it.
5346740	5347700	We're going to talk about it at the end.
5349220	5354020	You had From Ashes, where you get Javik as a squad mate, and he was absolutely hilarious.
5354020	5358100	You had Leviathan that went into the Reaper's Origins.
5358980	5367140	You had Omega, which was taking Omega back for Aria.
5367140	5371460	And of course, that's the one that gave us our first female turian.
5373460	5375380	And then Citadel, which was...
5376340	5381700	Citadel was like, hi, we've read your fan fiction, pretty much.
5382980	5389460	I also liked, I don't know if you got this, but the place that the condo that Shepard
5389460	5391380	was left was called Tiberius Towers.
5392420	5396660	And Tiberius was the middle name of Captain Kirk.
5396660	5397160	Yep.
5398020	5403220	There's also an interactive comic called Genesis 2 that you could play and customize
5403220	5407700	for just quick setting up your story if you didn't have a game go through.
5409140	5413540	But Citadel was just, it was a trip.
5413540	5414100	It was great.
5414100	5418180	You know that you can actually still buy the, do you say, sushi plate set?
5419060	5424020	Do you say it was the restaurant where the Citadel thing starts going down?
5424020	5429220	Anyway, let's talk about the response.
5429940	5433620	So gameplay got a lot of praise.
5433620	5436420	It was decided to be really, really good.
5436420	5442100	There were some bugs, but for the most part, the characters made up for the flaws.
5442100	5444820	The voice acting was top notch.
5445460	5446740	The music was great.
5446740	5458260	Everything overall that went into the game was pretty well received, except the endings.
5459620	5469300	So the endings for Mass Effect 3 was, no one liked it and by no one I mean most of the
5469300	5470100	internet.
5470100	5475700	And so there was an internet campaign called Retake Mass Effect to demand better ending
5475700	5476260	to the game.
5476900	5480180	And part of that included a charity drive for Child's Play.
5480180	5481140	So some good from that.
5481700	5488900	The public outcry basically even had responses from the Better Business Bureau and Federal
5488900	5493940	Trade Commission and the advertising standards authority to whether or not BioWare had engaged
5493940	5496260	in false advertising and misled the customers.
5497060	5505060	So on April 5th, 2012, BioWare announced a free DLC pack that would expand upon the ending
5505060	5506500	and address the criticism.
5506500	5512100	And it was called the Extended Cut that did come out on June 26, 2012.
5512100	5513300	And it was a mixed bag.
5515380	5518020	Honestly, I'm fine with it.
5518020	5521780	I love Extended Cut, but the original ending never bothered me so much.
5521780	5525060	It wasn't great, but some movies have bad endings.
5525060	5527220	I always thought this was way...
5527220	5528820	That's why I can't stand the mist.
5528820	5530100	Yeah, I always thought this...
5530100	5531540	It could have just kept it like the book.
5531540	5532980	Blown way out of proportion.
5533780	5543620	Well, there were other issues like the conflict of interest issue for having Jessica Chobot
5543620	5545380	as Diana Allers.
5546420	5546740	Oh, yeah.
5548900	5552100	And then some people were all like...
5553300	5558820	They didn't like the same sex aspect to relationships for Shepard.
5558820	5563700	And then they also didn't like that there were some characters who weren't available
5563700	5566740	for that, because I mean, let's just face it, everyone wants to romance Garris.
5569380	5575300	But at any rate, it originally shipped 3.5 million units in the first month.
5575300	5581060	It sold 349,000 digital copies by the end of March alone.
5581860	5589060	The game sold over 890,000 copies in its first 24 hours.
5590340	5595540	And according to MPD Group, it sold 1.3 million physical copies in the first month,
5595540	5600580	which was twice the total of Mass Effect 2 during its opening month in January 2010.
5601300	5609300	And in May 2012, EA reported that Mass Effect 3 grossed over 200 million during quarter 4 FY12.
5610260	5613060	So that's financial year for people who don't know.
5613060	5617140	And as far as accolades, it got a number of awards.
5617140	5622180	The Satellite Award for Outstanding Role Playing Game, Best RPG at the Spike Video Game Awards,
5622180	5627620	Game of the Year from Game Informer, Best Overall RPG from IGN, Best Cooperative Multiplayer,
5627620	5630420	Best Game Cinematography from Inside Gaming Awards.
5633380	5636660	But basically, the legacy left by Mass Effect 3,
5637540	5641780	it's really the one where we talk about entitled gamers.
5642580	5644260	We don't like the end, change it.
5645380	5653140	You know, and it also bringing in, you know, like when Andromeda came out,
5653140	5658260	they actually had some very racy scenes in there and were not shy at all about
5658260	5661940	romance options, you know, which I think is great.
5661940	5664900	I mean, Andromeda was questionable.
5665300	5672100	But in fact, moving into Andromeda, it was a sequel to the first trilogy,
5673700	5678820	but it takes place 634 years later because of
5682820	5688020	word cryology, the time it takes.
5688020	5690180	Cryogenic hibernation, that's what I'm thinking of.
5690820	5695860	Or you play as either Sarah or Scott finding a new homeworld for humanity.
5697300	5706180	And there's actually a Mass Effect universe game in development and pre-production at Bioware.
5706180	5708980	So we're going to be getting something else.
5708980	5712660	I just, I really, I really hope it's okay.
5713540	5722900	But as far as those scores, like the Xbox 360 and PS3 copies got a 93 of 100 for Metacritic,
5722900	5725620	PC got 89, Wii U got 85.
5726500	5730740	But now I'm going to talk about another part of this, and that's the mods.
5732580	5735940	My copy of Mass Effect 3 was modded to hell and back.
5736580	5744580	The high-res mod, beautiful, custom hair, awesome, fly cam, fly cam was my favorite.
5744580	5748420	And I had, if anyone remembers this, because it's still there,
5749540	5751940	I had a Tumblr account called Mass Effecting.
5752980	5755540	And it started with me making a stupid meme.
5756820	5757940	I don't even remember.
5757940	5761140	Oh yeah, it was a Vitturian with crossed eyes and it said Derpian.
5761140	5768740	And from there that blog had over 10,000 followers by the time I had been running it for two years.
5769620	5773780	I eventually gave up because I couldn't find any more, you know, good screenshots to use.
5774660	5781780	But just showing, I mean, I basically created like a whole head Canon in that universe that
5781780	5788100	people bought into, you know, but it just goes to show how big, you know, if my stupid Tumblr
5788100	5796340	could get that many followers for weird memes, then the fanfiction world blew up.
5796340	5800100	The fan merch world blew up, fan art blew up.
5800980	5806740	I mean, now to the point where BioWare and the Yeti, I think is another one that sells
5806740	5812020	some stuff, but like you can get official like Garris body pillows, you know, that type of thing.
5812020	5818100	It's just, it's spawned such an amazing fandom that still thrives to this day.
5818100	5823060	Maybe not as strong as it was, but it's still alive and kicking.
5823060	5828660	You know, those of us who romanced certain characters, anytime that character brings,
5828660	5834820	is brought up, we're like, oh yeah, we're like that with Dragon Age as well, but I digress.
5835220	5840100	But yeah, it's Mass Effect 3.
5840100	5844660	It's probably one of my favorite modern games.
5844660	5847540	I would probably say it is my favorite modern game.
5849060	5849560	All right.
5850660	5852340	Yeah, there you go.
5852340	5853140	There it is.
5853140	5856340	Your classic game of the week, Mass Effect 3.
5856340	5860660	I met so many friends through this game too, by the way.
5860660	5862820	I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.
5863540	5866740	I don't think the multiplayer got enough credit.
5866740	5871460	You know, everybody bitched about the ending and so many people bitched about multiplayer too.
5871460	5875380	And it's honestly one of the most enjoyable multiplayer experiences I've had in a game
5876260	5878500	where like literally a lot of my friends are playing it.
5878500	5879780	We did good things in it.
5879780	5881460	It impacted your single player game.
5881460	5883220	I just, it was so good.
5883220	5888340	Like I, I wish they had done a standalone multiplayer game and still kind of wish they
5888340	5892100	would just sort of bridge the gap between releases.
5892100	5894740	Andromeda's multiplayer was even okay.
5894740	5895860	It was different.
5895860	5898580	I mean, but it was, it was okay.
5899140	5899780	You know what I mean?
5899780	5900980	Like, I don't know what else to say.
5900980	5901480	It was okay.
5902180	5906100	But I still wish there would be something to kind of like hold us over.
5906100	5906500	I don't know.
5907060	5907780	I miss it.
5907780	5911060	Well, I'm glad they fixed a few things with Andromeda.
5911060	5912740	I didn't think it was a bad game at all.
5912740	5914660	I honestly enjoyed it.
5915540	5920020	But, um, but I, and there's people who think that Mass Effect 2 is the pinnacle of the
5920020	5924820	series, but honestly, I got a lot more out of the story for Mass Effect 3.
5924820	5931540	I thought that there was, especially for those of us who, you know, romanced Garrus, there
5931540	5936420	was a lot more payoff in it than just a head bump, you know?
5937860	5944420	But, but I'm actually looking at my mass affecting Tumblr and I forgot that I made
5944420	5945780	some of these ridiculous things.
5947540	5948100	All right.
5948100	5953300	You got 10,000 followers on your Tumblr, but this podcast can seem to only get 10 listeners.
5955060	5958020	Pint out our podcast on my Tumblr.
5958020	5958520	I know.
5959300	5959800	You know?
5960340	5960840	All right.
5961700	5962200	Anyway.
5963380	5963700	All right.
5963700	5964420	Well, there it is.
5964420	5967300	Now Dark Soccer has done the entire trilogy.
5967300	5969300	She can't pick a Mass Effect game ever again.
5969300	5971140	Well, when Andromeda is 10 years old, I guess.
5971140	5972900	When Andromeda is 10 years old, I sure can.
5975300	5976100	Uh, all right.
5976100	5976820	Let's miss you.
5976820	5978180	Wait, let's move on.
5978180	5979140	I guess I will.
5979140	5983140	So I'll see you in 2026 or whatever that game turns 10.
5983140	5983640	All right.
5984100	5985140	Will you still be doing this?
5985940	5986580	Who knows?
5986580	5987080	All right.
5987620	5992900	I mean, I'm pretty sure around episode nine, I was saying, can you imagine, or like we
5992900	5994900	were doing the first year, even a hundred episodes.
5994900	5998580	I was like, can you imagine if we were still doing this at a thousand episodes?
5998580	6001460	And now it's like, wow, that might actually happen.
6001460	6001940	All right.
6001940	6008820	Anyway, I'm putting it in the chat, but everyone needs to look at this because this is my favorite
6008820	6011380	one I've made for this little memes.
6011380	6011620	All right.
6011620	6013140	Well, we need to do rapid fire news.
6013140	6014100	So you keep the show moving.
6014100	6015220	Let's get to it.
6015220	6019860	Rapid fire news and some other stories, uh, around the gaming industry.
6019860	6020980	So Loki, we'll start with you.
6022180	6023140	Yeah, I'm pretty excited.
6023140	6027380	There's a brand new Lego game coming out called Lego brick tales.
6027380	6032260	And it's a little bit different than your typical Lego game by like traveler tales or
6032260	6032760	something like that.
6033300	6039380	Um, so this one is a physics based puzzle game.
6039380	6045860	So it kind of reminds me a little bit of besieged, or I guess a little bit like Kerbell's
6045860	6052980	space program where you have to build different devices out of Lego and they react to the
6052980	6053220	physics.
6053220	6056820	So like they have like, you know, a helicopter that you build or something like that, and
6056820	6058260	you have to solve puzzles with it.
6058260	6059620	So that sounds pretty cool.
6059620	6062740	And that's supposed to be releasing sometime this year.
6063380	6064980	So we'll have to look forward to that.
6065780	6073540	And then, uh, there is a silly game coming out by the folks that did the, uh, bloodborne
6074340	6076340	demake like for PlayStation one.
6076340	6080580	Now they're taking those models that they made for the demake and they're making bloodborne
6080580	6082580	cart, a goat cart game.
6082580	6086980	So I guess we'll have to wait and see with it.
6086980	6087780	Cause it's funny.
6088340	6089860	Yeah, no, I think it's funny too.
6089860	6093940	I wonder if it'll be as punishing of a cart game as those.
6095220	6099940	That would be funny if it was like a, like the ultimately punishing difficult like cart
6099940	6100260	game.
6100980	6102900	Uh, I would, I would think that was funny.
6102900	6106020	I probably wouldn't play it very long, but I think it was funny for the five minutes
6106020	6106500	I play it.
6107060	6107460	So, yeah.
6108020	6108340	All right.
6108900	6109700	Um, let's see.
6109700	6110580	How about dark Sakura?
6113300	6114500	I had to unmute.
6114500	6122260	So there is, there are, you know, uh, NFT games out there and basically all they are
6122260	6130980	is just to sell the NFTs, you know, but someone's actually making a game called alluvium that
6130980	6138180	is supposed to be pretty much up there with, with any good game, um, where you can earn
6138180	6139780	your NFTs in game.
6140500	6145220	Um, or you can purchase them or do exchanges with other people, but the fact that you can
6145220	6150900	get them in game makes it a little bit less cringey.
6151620	6160580	Um, but at any rate, um, the, uh, it's, it's the, the currency for it though is based on
6160580	6169220	Ethereum, but at any rate, uh, the game is where you have different robot helpers that
6169220	6174260	go with you and you have to explore the planet and you meet different creatures that you
6174260	6180260	battle with and your little robot friends, you know, are kind of your, your battler.
6180260	6183620	You also have to look at the synergy with your armor and all this other stuff.
6183620	6187620	And it actually looks like it's fairly complicated, uh, gameplay.
6187620	6195380	Um, but you can buy the, the native token with, uh, Binance, Qcoin, Poloniex, Gate.io,
6195380	6204020	other exchanges, um, for people who are into crypto and, and NFTs, I guess this would be
6205300	6206740	a good RPG.
6206740	6209220	And actually I've watched the, the trailer for it.
6209220	6210900	It actually kind of looks fun.
6212020	6215460	Um, they're focusing on marketing and promotion right now.
6215460	6223220	It's just that I hope that this doesn't set a, a trend for other games to come out like
6223220	6227380	it and to encourage these other companies to start dealing in NFT.
6227380	6228180	Oh, well too late.
6228740	6233940	They're everybody's I mean, I know I totally do, but I already, everybody's asking how
6233940	6234980	can we cash in on this?
6234980	6235700	I'm sorry.
6235700	6239140	Until NFTs don't feel like I'm participating in crime.
6239780	6242260	Um, I, I'm not interested in them.
6242260	6247460	Like I, I'm just, I just, I just, I'm sick of it being shoved into my face.
6247460	6251460	Like I need to accept these NFTs and, and this is where it's going.
6251460	6256100	Cause all the cool kids say it's going to FTS like prove it.
6256100	6258740	Like if it's that valuable, it'll stand out on its own.
6258740	6262900	But it's like you even whisper the letters NFT on Twitter and you're going to have bought
6262900	6267300	accounts up your asshole trying to sell things that like you just have no interest in.
6267300	6271060	And let's also talk about how ugly most of the NFTs that are available are.
6271540	6273940	Like a lot of those procedurally generated things and stuff.
6273940	6274820	It's stupid.
6275540	6280820	Now I will go out on a limb and say this one actually looks pretty good.
6280820	6281060	Yeah.
6281780	6287620	Now if a good game comes out, because again, a good game is a good game and it manages
6287620	6292500	to leverage NFTs in a way where again, it doesn't feel like I'm participating in crime.
6293140	6295860	I'll have a more open mind about it, but.
6296980	6299220	And this one, by the way, is running in Unreal five.
6300180	6300680	Interesting.
6301860	6302420	Yeah.
6302420	6303540	It's interesting.
6303540	6304580	I mean, that's it.
6304580	6313140	It's if, if this is a way that NFT actually is going to work in a.
6317540	6319300	I want to say ethical way.
6320260	6320980	No, I get it.
6320980	6321460	I get it.
6322660	6328980	Then I'm okay with something like this, especially if the fact that you can have a chance to
6328980	6334740	get the more valuable items in game and then trade around and move them up.
6334740	6337220	You know, for me, that's like playing, you know, playing magic.
6337940	6338440	Yeah.
6339060	6343620	You know, you would get your rare cards out of your, out of your packs and then trade
6343620	6345060	them around to your friends.
6345060	6346180	And I mean, that's.
6347460	6351460	Without, you know, all of the crypto aspect of it, that's essentially what NFTs are.
6352420	6355700	Um, a set in chat says the MLM of investing.
6356340	6359220	I, I, yeah, that's what NFTs certainly feel like.
6359220	6363700	But when, you know, speaking of MLMs, I'll still buy Tupperware at target.
6365140	6369220	So if there's a way to buy old Tupperware, if there's a, yeah, or old Tupperware at a
6369220	6378100	thrift store, if there's a way to make it feel less slimy and unnecessary, then I think
6378100	6382420	that's finally how people will crack the code on making the masses accept NFTs.
6382420	6385300	Cause right now it feels like, it feels like a crime family.
6385300	6385940	It really does.
6387620	6388260	So we'll see.
6389220	6399300	Uh, the other news, um, the Mario 64 guidebook scans were required to be taken down.
6399860	6406100	Um, they were, were all online with different 3d models for each of the levels and everything.
6406660	6412220	And, uh, they were required, uh, the uploader who's Dave, uh,
6412220	6415540	shoveling of comfort food, video games to, to take down.
6416260	6421140	And they challenged copyright and said, we don't, we don't want it anymore.
6421140	6423780	So they have to acquiesce.
6423780	6429620	I mean, they're really, really just tapping down on it and it's disgusting.
6429620	6429860	Yeah.
6429860	6431860	I mean, like I understand.
6433460	6440660	Piracy of scanned books is a crappy thing, but Mario essentials got taken down.
6441380	6441620	Yeah.
6441620	6443860	Mario 64 is also how old of a game.
6443860	6447860	And there comes a certain point where again, I think it's about preserving certain types
6447860	6448900	of media.
6448900	6453940	It's not like you can walk into a library and find a copy of this strategy guide or
6453940	6458740	find it through any sort of legitimate, at least first party means you might luck into
6458740	6463300	one at a garage sale, but how often is that or use bookstore, but how often is that going
6463300	6464100	to happen?
6464100	6469300	So I feel like these scans were a way to kind of preserve something that really wasn't,
6469300	6471860	let's it wasn't making Nintendo money.
6471860	6475940	And I, I, I'm sure there'll be people that are like, well, Nintendo has to defend their
6475940	6476420	trademarks.
6476420	6481300	So there's a certain line.
6481300	6485060	Nintendo keeps crossing that nobody else in the game industry feels like they need to
6485060	6485380	cross.
6486180	6490580	There, there should be a statute of limitations that applies to that.
6490580	6492580	Like, like with music or, or something.
6494500	6496020	Or even the hardware.
6496020	6500260	Cause you know, Nintendo hardware, third parties just make straight up Nintendo systems and
6500260	6506340	now super Nintendo systems, they can't be stopped because those trademarks do expire
6506340	6508260	after 30 years or something like that.
6508260	6512500	So that's why you have all of a sudden, all these other, like the retron five and stuff
6512500	6519220	that literally just play the carts because the, the ability for Nintendo to have the
6519220	6523220	market on that runs out after so many years, which is interesting.
6525220	6531620	Anyway, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and we'll start
6531620	6532900	with the U S and Loki.
6534020	6534260	Yep.
6534260	6536340	Not a whole lot coming out over here.
6536340	6540580	We've got Crusader Kings three on PlayStation five and Xbox series.
6541380	6548020	Uh, Chris star on Tendo switch, death stranding director's cut on PC.
6549300	6557860	Moss book two on PlayStation four and the weird West on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox
6557860	6558180	one.
6560020	6564420	Looking at Japan, uh, we have a few releases on the Nintendo switch this week.
6564420	6570980	We have Barry Shauna, uh, Senza, Ishigu no Kaze in a regular and limited edition.
6570980	6573620	There's also a twin pack coming out for all that.
6573620	6579700	A game called kiss trilogy is coming out as well, uh, which is includes the games hotch
6579700	6582340	kiss, kiss bell and kiss auto.
6582340	6589460	Um, they look like dating Sims and it's, um, women of a questionable age in swimsuits on
6589460	6590660	the cover hand drawn.
6590660	6592100	So it's, it's that kind of game.
6592660	6598660	Uh, we also have in Japan on the switch, uh, Hokago Cinderella is out in a regular and
6598660	6599940	a limited edition.
6599940	6607060	And, uh, that's it for the switch, but looking at the PlayStation five, uh, it's a dry week.
6607060	6609460	We don't have a release there until the 1st of April.
6609460	6612020	So, uh, no way, which I guess is this week, isn't it?
6612020	6615060	So I will mention, uh, what was it?
6615060	6615540	There it is.
6615540	6618580	MLB the show is out in Japan this week.
6618580	6621860	It's out in English, but, uh, it is still getting a regional release in Japan.
6622260	6623380	Very popular over there.
6623380	6625940	It sure is a dark soccer.
6625940	6626500	How about Europe?
6627460	6634580	So on the 29th, we have in nightmare for a PlayStation crusader Kings three for PlayStation
6634580	6641220	and X-Box on the 31st, we have grand mountain venture wonderlands for switch.
6641220	6646820	And then for PlayStation and X-Box, we have Tropico six, uh, next gen edition from it
6646820	6647220	looks like.
6647220	6650420	And then on April 1st, we have doki doki literature club.
6650420	6657940	Plus, all right, well, let's do some more news stories and then we'll get to emails
6657940	6662260	any calls that might want to come in tonight and all that other good stuff in our round
6662260	6662740	table.
6662740	6664900	But first, a few more headlines starting with Loki.
6666180	6666580	Yeah.
6666580	6674740	So rockstar has decided to go ahead and offer a subscription service now to grand theft
6674740	6677620	auto online called GTA plus.
6677620	6686180	It is going to cost $6 a month and they give you in game money as well as some other perks
6686180	6691780	along with that, mostly in game items and like properties and stuff like that.
6692420	6695300	But this is coming right after that.
6695300	6703060	They've decided to, um, basically sell the upgrade for grand theft auto five, um, and
6703060	6705700	online they're offering it now for like 40 bucks right now.
6705700	6709380	Grand theft auto online is actually free on PlayStation, I believe.
6710020	6712900	Um, but they're going to charge for that later on as well.
6713780	6717860	And it's just, it's, it's just another cash grab.
6717860	6720180	It's like subscribing to their shark cards.
6720740	6726500	And I think it's just terrible, but yeah, I saw, I saw your tweet tweet about it.
6726500	6730020	Like you definitely have some strong opinions, but I know it's just like, well, it's just
6730020	6731860	like, I just kind of given up on it.
6731860	6733780	It's like, what, what, what happened to you guys?
6733780	6738660	Like, seriously, like you used to be a company and make fun of companies like this, and now
6738660	6741380	you're just, just milking it.
6741380	6743300	Like this game is so old now.
6743860	6747700	We're almost classic game of the week time on this game because it's been out for so
6747700	6747940	long.
6748580	6752340	It's just like, I just don't understand.
6752340	6755380	I mean, I understand cause they're making tons of money off of it.
6755380	6759860	So, but it sounds like that they're just trying to get people hooked on this kind of
6759860	6760180	stuff.
6760180	6767380	And mind you that the reason why that $500,000 delivered to you each month, isn't a ton of
6767380	6767700	money.
6767700	6769460	It's because of them.
6769460	6772900	They've designed the game this way to make it incredibly grindy.
6772900	6776900	And I remember when I first started playing Grand Theft Auto online, it was grindy, but
6776900	6779380	it wasn't like super grindy.
6779380	6781300	Like now it's just ridiculous.
6781300	6784580	The amount of stuff that you have to pay for in that's all by design.
6784580	6787300	It's all by design, the milk, those microtransactions.
6787300	6788340	And that's what they do.
6788340	6793380	And that's how they're making billions of dollars off of this game from just the microtransactions
6793380	6796660	because you have to pay the upkeep your car.
6796660	6800740	You have to pay insurance on your car to pay rent for your apartment and stuff.
6800740	6801540	Yeah, I get it.
6801540	6806100	It's like real life, but I don't play Grand Theft Auto to experience real life.
6806100	6808980	Like, I don't understand.
6808980	6810020	Where's my cheat code?
6810020	6810820	Where's my cheat code?
6811860	6817460	It is on purpose because they make money off of this and now they're charging more money
6817460	6820100	for it because they're going to make money off of this.
6820740	6822740	It's just it's very blatant.
6822740	6824340	Like how cash grabby this is.
6824340	6828660	Well, mind you also, like I would say you're doing you're doing the right thing in voicing
6828660	6830820	your opposition by not playing.
6830820	6832660	You're not sitting there playing the game going.
6832660	6833140	I hate it.
6833140	6833540	I hate it.
6833540	6834020	I hate it.
6834020	6834900	You're just not playing.
6835860	6836420	Exactly.
6836420	6840900	Like if I was supposed to purchase the game, it would be on PC and it would be just to
6840900	6843380	play the single player and mess with mods.
6843380	6844100	And that's it.
6844100	6845940	I wouldn't be playing Grand Theft Auto online.
6845940	6847540	I have no interest in it.
6847540	6851060	And I understand that they're adding new content to Grand Theft Auto online.
6851060	6855300	But yeah, they should be if they're making a billion dollars off of that.
6855300	6859620	That that's that's like another Grand Theft Auto five every year.
6859620	6864740	Like, yes, they should be putting money into that if that's how much money they're making
6864740	6865140	out of it.
6866340	6868100	I mean, that's only fair, though.
6869220	6872740	And even I think what they're putting into it is not exactly what they're getting out
6872740	6872980	of it.
6873060	6876660	I think they're putting in far less versus what they're getting out.
6876660	6882580	So you do you, I guess, rock star, but like, I'm just not supporting it.
6884100	6884500	All right.
6885140	6887860	Well, moving on, we have another story from Dark Sakura.
6890260	6890760	We do.
6892260	6902660	So this is another sad outcome from the utter, utterly ridiculous actions taken by Russia
6902660	6903460	against Ukraine.
6904900	6912500	There is a video game history center in Ukraine is called the Mariupol Computer Museum.
6912500	6920660	It was destroyed earlier this week by a Russian bomb at over 120 retro computers and consoles,
6921700	6925780	as well as over 500 exhibits were destroyed.
6925780	6934820	It was owned by Dimitri Cherapanov, and he wanted to use it to highlight the retro.
6936500	6938580	Let me actually rewind back.
6938580	6944660	He wanted to make it just to show the history of retro computing consoles technology, anything
6944660	6950340	from the 1950s up to the early 2000s, a collection that took him over 20 years to make.
6950340	6955540	And it's absolutely disgusting.
6958420	6964100	Cherapanov is accepting donations to help rebuild the computer museum, at least in digital form.
6964100	6965380	He's got a website out.
6967220	6969220	I'll see if I can link it in chat.
6970260	6977460	But it's just, it's one part of this absolutely disgusting event.
6978260	6984340	And I'm just so irritated by it.
6985540	6988260	Irritated is a light word, but I'm completely off.
6988260	6995140	I mean, it's disgusting that Putin's army attacks museums, libraries, theaters.
6996420	6997940	And the thing is, it wasn't a target.
6999300	7000340	It was there.
7000340	7002180	Oh, but still.
7002740	7004900	Why would they target a video game museum?
7004900	7005620	They wouldn't do that.
7006340	7009300	When they bomb, they bomb city centers.
7009300	7015300	They bomb places that, you know, that are in general going to make strategic sense.
7015300	7016740	It wasn't targeted for it.
7017620	7029220	But the fact that it was a casualty of this callous, unnecessary behavior is absolutely
7029220	7029780	disgusting.
7030580	7035220	Well, I mean, just the fact they're targeting the places where people live and are in the
7035220	7040180	first place when it was always, you know, the line that Putin is about military and
7040180	7042900	all this stuff is like very clearly, that's not what's happening.
7042900	7047060	You know, it's yet another one of those, you know, many lies that comes out of his mouth.
7047060	7049300	So it's just, well, you know, he's friends with.
7049300	7050340	Yeah, I know.
7050340	7050900	It's just.
7052740	7057140	Yeah, anyway, Biden just said what we were all thinking.
7057780	7058820	That's all I'm going to say.
7059780	7061540	All right, moving on.
7061540	7064900	He said the quiet part out loud, which a president isn't supposed to do.
7064900	7065860	That's all.
7065860	7066340	All right.
7066340	7068020	Honestly, presidents should.
7069700	7070340	Sometimes.
7070340	7070840	Yes.
7071460	7072260	All right.
7072260	7073780	Moving on, Loki.
7075780	7079540	Then they also started DDoSing Among Us.
7079540	7080820	When's it going to stop?
7080820	7085380	But apparently it's been a lot of different services being DDoSed recently.
7086100	7092340	And the North American European servers are getting DDoSed right now for Among Us.
7092340	7098580	So it's hard for folks to log in or even play at all because of what's going on.
7099220	7099720	But.
7101060	7104180	Yeah, there's, you know, of course, they're working.
7104180	7108260	Airsloth is still working on fixing the server problems, but they don't have any sort of
7108900	7113220	update or what on when that's going to be resolved.
7114020	7114580	That sucks.
7117540	7121460	Yeah, why would you attack like a small indie game like this anyway?
7121460	7127380	I mean, I guess I know I was like the answers right themselves.
7127380	7129300	Like, of course, I should know better.
7129300	7130740	But it's just it's sad.
7131700	7133780	You know, it doesn't I don't know.
7135380	7136020	It's silly.
7136820	7138980	Anyway, I have one more.
7138980	7139700	I hate people.
7139700	7140340	I know, right?
7140900	7142260	I have one more story for tonight.
7142260	7147620	And it's about it's about a genre that we've started talking a lot more about ever since
7147620	7150260	Star Soccer and I got into Dead by Daylight.
7150260	7155220	And that is the 4v1 genre, which, of course, yes, DBD wasn't the first.
7155220	7157540	We had evolved asymmetrical horror.
7158500	7165060	Well, OK, I guess this would fall under asymmetrical horror, but a new game was now asymmetrical
7165060	7169620	horror because I experienced far more horror than I'm sure that the developers did.
7169620	7170020	All right.
7170020	7171060	Well, I got to hear about this.
7171060	7175380	So this is the announcement for Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed.
7176100	7178820	It is an asymmetrical multiplayer game.
7178820	7183060	I guess, you know, I don't think Ghostbusters was ever really scary, but, you know, I would
7183060	7188900	say some some horror falls in that Vincent Price and Elvira category where it's not scary.
7188900	7189860	It's just dark.
7190500	7197860	So Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed is being created by Friday the 13th Red Flag and predator
7197860	7200260	hunting grounds developer Il Fonic.
7200260	7204340	Actually, I like the Friday the 13th game when it first came out before it hit all those
7204340	7205220	legal issues.
7205220	7205940	So I don't know.
7205940	7206440	We'll see.
7207300	7212420	In Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed, you put on a proton pack, grab a ghost trap and monitor
7212420	7218340	the PKE meter as a ghostbuster in a team of four brave souls pursuing ghastly ghosts,
7218340	7220260	terrorizing public locations.
7221220	7226020	So, of course, if you are a ghostbuster, you want to find the ghost, blast them with stream,
7226020	7228260	get them in place and then shut the trap.
7228260	7234660	The ghost, on the other hand, get to fly, teleport between rifts, possess objects and
7234660	7237860	use slime and summoning ghoulish minions to win the day.
7238740	7242740	So Dark Sakura, did you check out the trailer?
7242740	7243380	Do you have thoughts?
7246580	7247860	I don't have any thoughts right now.
7250340	7253620	I have so many other things I have to play right now that I don't have time to think
7253620	7254420	of playing anything else.
7255620	7261060	I should point out that Ernie Hudson, who plays Winston Zetimore and Dan Aykroyd, who
7261060	7263620	play Ray Stantz, will be voices in the game.
7263620	7264900	So there is a little bit of a tie.
7264900	7265780	Okay, then I'm playing it.
7267780	7269700	Loki, what were your thoughts?
7269700	7270580	It looks dumb.
7270580	7271620	It really looks dumb.
7271620	7276820	Like, honestly, like they had a really good single player Ghostbusters game not that long
7276820	7281780	ago that was essentially with all the original cast from the Ghostbusters in there.
7282580	7285140	It's supposed to be a semi-official sequel.
7287620	7288120	Yeah.
7289140	7290020	Yeah, that one is.
7290020	7293620	And this one is just it just looks like a cash grab.
7293620	7296020	Honestly, like, it just doesn't.
7296900	7298340	I don't see this doing well.
7299860	7301300	It just didn't look interesting.
7301300	7305860	And funny enough, actually, this whole idea of, like, ghosts versus, like, ghost hunters
7305860	7306660	type of thing.
7306660	7311700	They have an indie game that's basically this already that was in development and looked
7311700	7312820	much better.
7312820	7315300	Like, are you talking about I see people play that on Twitch.
7315300	7316740	Are you talking about Phasmophobia?
7317380	7318820	No, it's not Phasmophobia.
7319780	7326020	It was an asymmetrical game because Phasmophobia is basically you against computer where I
7326020	7332020	don't remember what it was called, but it was a multiplayer like ghost hunting game
7332660	7340340	and it was an indie game that came or I don't even know if it's out yet, but I know there's
7340340	7341780	Phasma, but it's not Phasma.
7341780	7346900	OK, well, there's and the 4v1 again, I don't know if that's just dead by daylight success,
7346900	7350020	especially when it comes to Twitch and those sorts of environments or what.
7350020	7353780	But we're seeing a lot of these and I'm not even just talking about like VHS, but now
7353780	7358500	there's like an official Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre that's coming out.
7358500	7359060	That's like this.
7359060	7363860	I mean, it seems like this is a genre that more people are trying to get into.
7363860	7368900	And, you know, again, some are going to flop, but some might do OK.
7368900	7369460	We'll see.
7369460	7372580	VHS is actually should be coming back online soon.
7373140	7374020	Yeah, it might be.
7374020	7376260	I think it's this one, Midnight Ghost Hunt.
7376260	7379060	It's actually an early access starting March 31st.
7379060	7380820	Oh, and it's essentially like.
7382420	7386340	It looks exactly like the ghost was saying, except this looks better, actually.
7388020	7392020	Well, I mean, indie games have a lot of good stuff.
7392020	7393780	That's where your Minecraft came from.
7393780	7395940	That's where Among Us came from.
7395940	7399300	You know, the next big thing is oftentimes driven by an indie.
7399300	7403540	So, yeah, I would say Midnight Ghost Hunt looks way better than Ghostbusters.
7404180	7405700	Ghostbusters looks cheap.
7405700	7407700	And that's sad because I like Ghostbusters.
7408500	7409220	All right.
7409220	7414900	We're going to get to our listener roundtable where we get inspiration from all of you.
7414900	7417460	So we get we get our mailbag.
7417460	7421220	We might do some calls tonight if you want to join our green room on Discord.
7421220	7427060	And we also get to your questions in our Twitch chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
7427700	7432100	We'll head first to the mailbag at participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7432180	7435780	If you want to send us an email for a future week, let's get to it.
7435780	7437140	I think we have at least one email tonight.
7437140	7437780	Dark Soccer.
7437780	7438340	We have one.
7438900	7439700	Uno.
7439700	7440900	Hi. Are you ready?
7442340	7443620	Hi again, OLR crew.
7443620	7444900	It's been a long time.
7444900	7447380	When I started working remote during the pandemic,
7447380	7450340	I didn't have my commute time to listen to podcasts anymore.
7450340	7453140	Well, a few weeks ago, I had to start coming into the office again.
7453140	7455380	So I'm back to listening to OLR as well.
7455380	7458820	The show still sounds great, even though you aren't in the same room anymore.
7459460	7465860	Anyway, just writing because one of my big interests is movies and specifically the Oscars
7465860	7467380	since the ceremony is coming up.
7467380	7472740	And a couple of weeks ago, you're all talking about theories on how the statues are handed out.
7472740	7477220	All of the winners receive their actual Oscar statues when they accept the award.
7477220	7480020	They carry that same statue around all night.
7480020	7484500	And after the ceremony, the winners go to the Governor's Ball,
7484500	7490660	where there is an area where a personalized engraved plaque is affixed while they wait.
7490660	7491940	That's pretty much it.
7491940	7495460	Sorry I don't have much to say about video games right now,
7495460	7498420	though I am excited for the Rift Tracks video game.
7499140	7504580	It sounds like they are taking a page out of the Jackbox Playbook, and I can't wait to play it.
7504580	7506660	Keep up the great show, Flaco Jones.
7506660	7507860	That game looks awesome.
7507860	7510660	Yeah, strong agree on the Rift Tracks.
7510660	7513380	So always great to hear from Flaco Jones.
7513380	7518020	I didn't even think about the fact that people kind of losing their commutes for a long time
7518020	7520500	kind of cut into the listenership of the show.
7520500	7524420	I just thought, I don't know, this show was getting worse and people were finding better shows.
7524420	7525780	No, I'm kidding.
7526500	7532580	I had a lot of that going on with me listening to that one podcast.
7532580	7535940	I'm super fond of Stuff Mom Never Told You.
7535940	7536440	Mm hmm.
7538020	7541220	And and I mean, it's.
7542820	7544580	The easiest time is when you're on the road.
7545860	7552100	It's I run it Flaco Jones, I think, meant this email for last week and we won't talk about last
7552100	7556260	week, but I think it's interesting because now he's talking about the Oscars, which happened to
7556260	7559060	be, you know, I'm not oblivious to what's going on in the real world.
7559060	7560100	I know that's going on right now.
7560100	7561140	You have to go to a birthday party.
7561140	7568980	Yeah, well, while while this is going on, but I now that that was I'm like, I have heard
7568980	7569700	this before.
7569700	7574180	I've heard about the fact that there's like an official party with an engraving station
7574180	7575140	and all this stuff.
7575140	7576740	I have heard that before.
7576740	7578500	So thanks for reminding me.
7578500	7580820	I could I couldn't think about it in the moment.
7580820	7583860	But now you have me thinking about the Rift Tracks game and you have our chat thinking
7583860	7588820	about it as well as to what Matt says, I'd be down for a Rift Tracks night has Twitch
7588820	7589700	integration.
7589700	7590660	Yeah, sounds like fun.
7591140	7592660	I'd be down for that, that's for sure.
7593700	7597860	All right, I think we have a caller that wants to come on.
7597860	7600340	So I am going to try to make that happen.
7600340	7602260	We'll see how successful it is.
7602260	7606500	But I am going to go and bring this person on and say hello.
7606500	7608420	You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
7608420	7608920	Who's this?
7609700	7613140	You didn't think my hot take was going to be limited to 15 seconds tonight.
7613140	7614340	Of course not.
7614340	7615380	How's it going?
7615380	7616260	It's good to hear from you.
7617140	7622500	Uh, open ended question that leads into the point that I kind of wanted to make.
7622500	7623000	All right.
7623700	7633940	What are each of your first biggest thoughts on why scummy loot boxes, transactions, etc.
7633940	7635540	are all such a thing these days?
7636420	7639700	Because they work very well one time.
7640740	7643220	And for example, Overwatch.
7643220	7647700	Overwatch did the loot box thing, and it did it successfully.
7647700	7651940	I think other games did it too that are not in my wheelhouse, like Call of Duty or something
7651940	7652340	like that.
7652900	7654500	Oh, it's just no sports game.
7654500	7656340	Well, okay, Mass Effect 3.
7657700	7661540	And that, but or as, and Loki did make this point earlier in the show.
7662660	7666660	A free game does it first as a way to monetize the game.
7667300	7669460	And then it's extremely successful.
7670020	7674900	And then somebody decides, well, why can't we do that on top of the $60 game?
7674900	7678660	And then you get that Star Wars game from a couple of years ago with Pink Darth Vader.
7679460	7680580	A battlefield.
7680580	7681140	Yeah.
7681140	7681700	Battlefront.
7681700	7682260	Battlefront.
7682260	7683060	Battlefront.
7683060	7683560	Battlefront.
7684420	7685060	Yeah.
7685060	7687540	EA EA battle game.
7687540	7687940	Right.
7687940	7689940	License character three.
7689940	7690580	Exactly.
7692100	7695300	So yeah, that's my thought.
7695300	7698100	So okay, you started with the question, but.
7699860	7704740	I, the, the rest of the, the rest of the point that I have is a little bit of a ramble and
7704740	7708580	it's a really conflicting thought because of my own punditry and whatnot as well.
7710020	7712980	Back in, oh geez, what year would this have been?
7712980	7714500	2015.
7715700	7720820	I was, I was a lot more into the tech punditry world than I am, than I have been in many
7720820	7721380	years now.
7722100	7725140	I don't know if any of you know the name MG Siegler.
7725540	7731060	Um, big wig investor, been on a bunch of podcasts, uh, guests of podcasts.
7731060	7736340	He's a, he's a big name in the punditry world and he's aligned with, uh, Oh geez.
7736340	7736980	I actually don't know.
7736980	7741300	I think he, I think he stepped up to Google ventures from, from lesser ones and that kind
7741300	7742020	of stuff.
7742020	7747940	At any rate, like I have not to, not to go all in on just all, all, you know, all management
7747940	7750020	is evil, but that's certainly kind of a thing.
7750020	7755060	Just that the business management thing really ticks me off in the artistic sphere.
7755060	7756180	It's not far off.
7756180	7756900	Let's be real.
7758740	7759700	MG Siegler.
7759700	7766340	I, I, I always disagreed with him a little bit and he was a lot more brash than I typically
7766340	7769700	like personalities to be personalities that I actually pay attention to.
7769700	7774580	But the one thing that really got under my skin was that, uh, there was this one article
7774580	7780420	that he was talking about, uh, Nintendo products should not be controlled by Nintendo.
7781060	7783860	Nintendo should not make decisions about Nintendo.
7783860	7786660	That's just the whole, why isn't Mario on PS5?
7786660	7790420	That's, that's, that is that exact same argument in another dress.
7790980	7796580	And remember, remember the year, the context in particular was we, you, uh, and I, I know
7796580	7801060	I've said on this show multiple times that like, you know, the, the SNES was good.
7801060	7807380	The N64 was difficult and weird, but probably okay because of the generational, you know,
7807380	7813380	the 3d, the great 3d transition kind of mitigated the roughness that the Nintendo 64 had.
7813940	7819860	The GameCube, I actually kind of put in cult classic territory where it was damn good and
7819860	7823780	had amazing games, but it certainly fell behind.
7823780	7826260	It was certainly, you know, number three amongst the big three.
7827220	7828900	But it had amazing titles.
7828900	7836020	And I've said numerous times about how the Wii was a gigantic breakout because of Wii Sports.
7837060	7838820	And the rest of it's normal.
7838820	7842260	It's normal, you know, gamer base, the people that enjoy these kinds of things.
7842260	7847940	The Wii U, Nintendo, you know, tried to do what they thought was a success and it was,
7847940	7851700	yeah, it was problematic for every reason that it was.
7852340	7856900	Well, you know, I'm going to bring this up because, you know, this is the hill I will
7856900	7858740	die on when it comes to the Wii U.
7858740	7861780	I'm going to point me to the hill and I will go die on it.
7862340	7865380	This is not going to surprise you or anyone that's listened to this show for any amount
7865380	7865780	of time.
7866580	7872100	The Wii U would have had an entirely different trajectory if they'd given it a better name.
7872260	7877220	I agree with that.
7877220	7883220	The minute, just the last thought, the minute they showed up on the Tonight Show and the
7883220	7885220	guy, was it Fallon or Leno?
7885220	7885700	I don't know at the time.
7885700	7886500	I think it was Fallon.
7886500	7889380	Fallon at the time goes, so this is an expansion for the Wii?
7890180	7892260	No, this is a new thing.
7892260	7894420	That was the moment that system was fucked.
7895380	7899300	And that should have been the way the tea leaves said this system is fucked.
7899300	7904580	If Jimmy Fallon didn't understand that, how is Soccer Mom USA shopping at Walmart going
7904580	7905700	to understand that?
7905700	7912100	And that the name fucked that system harder than any name has ever fucked a system.
7914180	7918580	I agree that it's not one thing.
7918580	7924980	There certainly is, to an extent, a majority thing that was absolutely a big thing.
7925780	7933140	And along the lines of a saying that I've recently adopted, you cannot reproduce lightning
7933140	7934100	in a bottle.
7934100	7936180	And the Wii was lightning in a bottle.
7936180	7939860	So when they focused on lightning in a bottle and it isn't that, well, it's a failure.
7939860	7940820	No, it's not.
7940820	7943860	There were still some pretty damn good elements of the Wii U.
7943860	7946020	They just were seen in a different lens.
7946020	7949780	Nintendo wanted the Wii U also, I think, on the technical level.
7950340	7955860	You obviously, everybody sees how we got to the Switch from the Wii U.
7955860	7961300	And I think a lot of people look at the Wii U and go, man, I bet Nintendo wanted that
7961300	7964900	to be the Switch and they just couldn't bottle it.
7964900	7971380	So they did what they thought was the next best thing and gave it a crappy name when
7971380	7974740	it had nothing to do with what made the Wii the Wii.
7974740	7980420	And then that's why now when they called it the Switch, now they go on Fallon, same
7980420	7983140	fucking show, make a much better argument.
7983140	7987220	But again, I'm trying not to keep falling back on the name thing, but it's important.
7987220	7992660	I really, truly believe it was the biggest problem with that system and why it did so
7992660	7993460	poorly.
7993460	7999540	That and the crappy third party releases that were copies of year old games.
7999540	8000660	But I digress.
8000660	8007460	My point was Nintendo kind of, I think, was under a lot of pressure, probably from those
8007460	8013780	same third parties that then gave them literal scraps for their system.
8014820	8019380	I think Nintendo was under a lot of pressure to step it up from a technical perspective.
8019380	8027620	Remember, the Wii could barely handle 480i in a day when HDTVs were taken off, right?
8027700	8033620	HDTVs were unheard of in 2006, but the Wii could not output 720 pixels.
8034740	8041140	So I think Nintendo was under a lot of pressure from third party companies to put out something
8041140	8046420	technically advanced, but like that could be the Wii.
8047060	8052180	And I think that's why Nintendo ultimately picked the name that fucked them, because
8052180	8056100	they were trying to appease these third parties that left them at the altar.
8056100	8060180	I swear this is exactly how it played out.
8060180	8064180	They picked the name to appease the third parties who ended up stabbing them in the
8064180	8064820	back at the end.
8065780	8066500	Absolutely.
8067620	8069380	And have been on again, off again.
8069940	8073220	The Nintendo 64 was difficult to develop for intentionally.
8074020	8075860	Yeah, the Nintendo relationship.
8076740	8082900	Nintendo has always been a highly unique, has always carved out their highly unique
8082900	8090020	niche, which was not as dramatic in the simpler times of gaming and is a lot worse.
8090020	8095140	So now with the big in battles of Sony and Microsoft.
8095140	8096180	And do you know why?
8096180	8098340	Do you know why that's Nintendo's approach, Jason?
8098340	8101220	Because now I know that's not what you called in about, but now you've got me on a whole
8101220	8103540	other thing because I just had an aha moment.
8103540	8105460	As you were saying, I had an aha moment.
8105460	8105780	Fun.
8105780	8106980	And it's how they see the world.
8106980	8111780	No, this is because no, I'm talking about the third parties and why Nintendo is never
8111780	8120660	really like them or have them in a place because Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment
8120660	8122980	System under those pretenses.
8124500	8125700	Think about this.
8125700	8130020	When Nintendo came into the market, it was after the crash of 1984.
8130020	8132580	What caused the crash of 1984?
8133300	8139380	Atari money grabbing, terrible licensing deals, shitty ports, shitty adaptations.
8139380	8140260	Ports weren't a thing.
8140260	8142180	Literally terrible business decision.
8142180	8149220	Everybody developing everything for the Atari started the crash of 1984.
8150100	8154820	Chuck Purina Chuck Wagon caused the video game crash of 1984.
8154820	8155220	Okay.
8155220	8156660	And all of those things.
8156660	8160580	So my whole point was Nintendo enters the market now with the Nintendo Entertainment
8160580	8161140	System.
8161140	8163300	And you may or may not recall this rule.
8163300	8168020	Nintendo had a rule in place for the Nintendo Entertainment System, not the not the family
8168020	8171460	seal of quality, not just that, but the yeah.
8171460	8176660	Well, yeah, it was that because the whole we will not allow you to release more than
8176660	8182740	three games a year under your label because of Atari, basically, is it was the unsaid
8182740	8184580	part because of Atari.
8184580	8187620	And so that's why get you Nintendo seal of quality.
8187620	8189380	You can only get three games a year.
8189380	8192180	This is why we got ultra games, right?
8192180	8197060	Ultra games was just Konami trying to release three more games a year.
8197060	8200340	And then suddenly people started to find their way around the seal of quality.
8200340	8204900	And then at some point, ironically, Atari comes into the room and says, You know what?
8204900	8206420	Fuck the seal of quality.
8206420	8209460	We're going to reverse engineer our own fucking cartridge.
8209460	8211140	And then that's a whole lawsuit, right?
8211140	8211460	Colored.
8212820	8214580	Yeah, that whole thing happens.
8214580	8219380	And then now Nintendo has to retreat from that perspective a little bit, especially
8219380	8221380	by the time the Super Nintendo comes out.
8221380	8229540	But now Nintendo's culture, it's been set from 1985 or four when it no 1985 when the
8229540	8231460	NES came out, not the Famicom NES came out.
8232500	8235140	Nintendo has always seen the third party as the enemy.
8236420	8239620	To say nothing about all the other times they've dipped their toes under the water and things
8239620	8240500	have gone sideways.
8240500	8242820	The Nintendo PlayStation, the CDI.
8244660	8250980	So I mean, the DD, I think I assume I don't actually know enough about the DD, but certainly
8251220	8256580	the Virtual Boy, they've had their fair flops that didn't even have the ability to permeate
8256580	8257140	much longer.
8257140	8257780	Let's be real.
8257780	8263700	When Nintendo tried to allow themselves to be the third party, that led to that.
8263700	8267860	Well, I mean, technically is more of a licensing IP agreement, but I was gonna say the CDI
8267860	8269860	games were what they got out of that.
8269860	8274900	And honestly, I can understand why Nintendo is like never again after that.
8274900	8280260	Like it is written on a wall in a boardroom somewhere.
8280260	8281140	Never again.
8281140	8287300	And that was written on the wall in like 1998 or whenever that game was out and has not
8287300	8288660	been removed ever since.
8289300	8294660	Yeah, and it is unfortunate that they because they have their own opinions that go in their
8294660	8301460	own direction and the switch isn't 10 times bigger volumetrically that it doesn't have
8301460	8307380	the latest, the latest processor spec of the tech industry that drives the modern gaming
8307380	8308020	industry.
8308020	8314420	Yeah, it's a shame that things have to be lesser to fit on Switch on the flip side,
8314420	8316660	the switches experience and everything else.
8316660	8321620	I like I've told at least 10 people this over the last month.
8321620	8328900	Odyssey, Breath of the Wild, Arceus and Kirby being open world, free form, smooth as hell
8328900	8333060	are a joy and docked and portable.
8333060	8335140	I don't give a shit that they don't look realistic.
8335140	8337380	The games, you know, that's not the games motif anyways.
8337380	8344260	But like these games for all of the series, like I've never beaten a Pokemon game until
8344260	8344740	Arceus.
8344740	8345780	I'm very close to it.
8345780	8348580	I've never beaten a Zelda game until Breath of the Wild.
8348580	8352740	I did do at least a base pack, not Champions Quest, blah, blah, blah.
8354020	8355060	Yeah, Champions Quest.
8355940	8361620	Like I subscribe to Nintendo's design principles.
8361620	8362980	I play games for fun.
8363860	8366180	I respect pro gamers.
8366740	8368660	I respect speed runners.
8368660	8369460	I love watching.
8369460	8371460	It could never do it like you do.
8371460	8372820	You have your own opinion.
8372820	8374500	I'm not saying don't do that.
8374500	8377780	I'm saying that I enjoy what I get out of Nintendo.
8377780	8382340	Yes, I would like most, but I'm going to take what I get and I'm going to take what I get
8382340	8383860	and I enjoy it and I do.
8383860	8385460	And that's kind of what drives me.
8387460	8390580	Anyway, I think I took the car in a completely different direction from what you originally
8390580	8391380	called in about, Jason.
8391380	8396100	I'm sorry, but business people should not make artistic
8396100	8396660	decisions.
8396660	8397540	Okay, we agree on that.
8397540	8402900	It's unfortunate that business people are driving art down people's throats as the primary
8402900	8403300	asset.
8403300	8408580	And this is completely an issue with the game industry completely because the people making
8408580	8410100	decisions that are shitty.
8410100	8411220	Let's say Bobby Kotick.
8411220	8413140	Let's take the shittiest one of them all.
8413700	8415060	The shittiest one of all time.
8415060	8417460	The shittiest gaming executive of all time.
8417460	8418260	Bobby Kotick.
8419380	8420100	Not a gamer.
8420980	8421620	Businessman.
8421620	8426500	He's a lot of other crappy things, too, but he's definitely not a gamer.
8426500	8429780	Now let's take one of the best in the industry right now.
8429780	8435140	Phil Spencer and Microsoft Gamer came up from those rates.
8435140	8435940	Huge advocate.
8436580	8438260	Still doing the same thing that he's done best.
8438260	8441140	These what, four, three, four generations after?
8441940	8448020	And to Nintendo's credit and how they make such good fucking games, many of them came
8448020	8450580	up the ranks, still play games.
8450580	8455860	And there is a certain love of video games from those first party Nintendo developers
8455860	8464740	from the House of Miyamoto, from that whole area, that whole team that feels such love
8464740	8469220	for the video game that it shows in the product that comes out.
8469220	8475860	It doesn't feel like a cash grab because Nintendo, for the most part, has been the last one to
8475860	8477620	the party for most of those things.
8478260	8483700	Not all of the time, but for the most part, we're not seeing shitty season passes in
8483700	8485380	Pokemon Arceus, right?
8487300	8493380	So the updates that they do put out, like the Breath of the Wild add ins, are entirely
8495220	8499540	Nintendo DLC is usually for the most part, by and large, pretty good.
8501300	8502020	Top line.
8502740	8503060	Sorry.
8503700	8506980	I said for the most part, don't fucking change the argument.
8507060	8507560	Yeah.
8508900	8510900	Switch online is a different problem.
8510900	8514580	Art does not come from the place that business does, and business is too heartless to be
8514580	8515080	art.
8515540	8521060	And so when you make art via business, you get it wrong unless you're insanely lucky
8521060	8522740	and you cannot design to be lucky.
8522740	8523940	You just get lucky.
8523940	8525140	This is the thing that happens.
8525140	8527140	Quest Buster nails it, and I should have said this, too.
8527140	8532580	Iwata came up the ranks as a programmer through HAL to head Nintendo years later and could
8532580	8533780	still read code.
8533780	8538100	That is why Balloon Fight, even if it's not your favorite Nintendo game, if there's a
8538100	8543060	list of 10 Nintendo games you must play before you leave this world or whatever, Balloon
8543060	8544580	Fight should be one of the 10.
8544580	8548020	And I'm not saying Balloon Fight is the greatest NES game that was ever written.
8548020	8550900	In fact, Balloon Fight is basically a Joust clone, right?
8552020	8554340	Because that's what it was actually started to be written as.
8554340	8556500	It was supposed to be just an NES port of Joust.
8556500	8559540	But anyway, my point, and I think you all know what I'm getting to.
8559540	8561620	That was a game that was made by Iwata.
8562420	8566820	So that is why you should play that game, because that was Iwata's game that he wrote
8567460	8568420	as a programmer.
8568980	8575380	And I think you should play that to see that's where he came through the ranks and designed
8575380	8575780	that.
8575780	8581700	And even if you look at it from the perspective of a Joust clone, it still added a new mode
8581700	8585700	to the game that I think exceeded the clone part.
8585700	8586500	You know what I mean?
8586500	8590740	Like there's that base game that feels like Joust, but then there's that story mode that's
8590740	8593380	like that eternal scroller to the left.
8593380	8599700	That mode is remembered a lot more fondly than the mode that actually was the Joust
8599700	8600340	part of the game.
8600900	8601460	Oh, yeah.
8601460	8603060	I don't remember that.
8603060	8606180	I only remember the lock screen battle because you brought it up.
8606180	8610660	The scroller is absolutely the adventure is what resonates in my brain.
8610660	8615860	Technically, the lock screen battle was a vertical scroller on the versus portion of
8615860	8616100	the game.
8616100	8618100	But I think we get into semantics at that point.
8618740	8620820	The point is a water wrote it.
8620820	8622340	He put a spin on it.
8622340	8622900	He made it.
8623460	8627460	The spin was more memorable than what the game was trying to be in the first place.
8627460	8632820	And I think you see that throughout Nintendo's history, which is why his loss was such a
8632820	8638580	huge, like, just really like, you know, when that happened at Nintendo, you know, when
8638580	8641140	that happened, it shows in the games that came out.
8641140	8646820	I'm not saying it's all 100% bad, but you know, when a water passed away, Nintendo went
8646820	8648100	through, you know, those anyway.
8648900	8649460	I digress.
8649460	8657300	Art is a vision and an opinion, sometimes a constraint, sometimes, you know, giving
8657300	8658900	up one to satisfy the other.
8658900	8665620	And business is all parts to is an all parts guess.
8665620	8667540	And it's just not the same world.
8667540	8672500	And I will lean in the direction of art over business, which is strange considering how
8672500	8674420	otherwise I consider myself very objective.
8674420	8676500	But that's me taking it in and not creating it.
8676500	8677860	So I can be on the other side.
8678660	8682660	I can go in what I like of art objectively and not produce.
8682660	8687300	Hey, if Loki has proved anything, any idiot can make a game, Jason.
8689300	8689940	Very true.
8691300	8692820	And I say that I'll leave it to him.
8692820	8694180	I say that would love Loki.
8694180	8695700	Loki and Loki knows this.
8695700	8698820	I go on to podcast panels at Dragon Con, whatever con I'm at.
8698820	8701860	And I always say any idiot can podcast.
8701860	8702660	I'm living proof.
8703940	8706020	So all right, Jason.
8706020	8707540	I'm going to wrap it up so we can take another call.
8707540	8710660	But thank you and appreciate all you do for the show as always, of course.
8710660	8714500	And yeah, any last quick thought before we let you go?
8715860	8716980	I don't have a quick summary.
8717540	8719140	Enjoy what you enjoy, folks.
8719140	8720180	That's all that matters.
8720180	8720660	Sounds good.
8720660	8721380	Take care, my friend.
8721940	8722500	Good night.
8722500	8723460	Good night.
8723460	8724820	All right, let's go right into another call.
8724820	8727620	We're going to bring somebody else here on air and get to it.
8727620	8729620	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8729620	8730020	Who's this?
8732660	8734580	You're on mute and or you stepped away.
8735460	8736820	I how about now?
8736820	8738500	Hey, it's Rhonda.
8738500	8739220	How's it going?
8740820	8742980	Well, my voice is shot.
8743700	8745460	I had a Philly cheesesteak.
8746500	8748660	I am slowly unpacking from a convention.
8749380	8752260	And the last talk with VX Jason XV.
8752260	8754900	You got me wanting to talk about more stuff.
8754900	8756740	So wow.
8757540	8759380	Well, what do you want to talk about, please?
8759380	8763460	Well, I just want to say, yeah, any idiot can podcast.
8763460	8764740	I'm just saying, okay.
8767220	8770740	And then there are some really smart people who can't podcast their way out of a paper bag.
8771620	8773460	Also true, honestly.
8773460	8780340	Well, that that is why there was a couple of things I want to talk about, but I can't
8780340	8783540	remember most of it because I have the memory retention of a goldfish.
8783540	8786740	But I want to say I was at a convention this weekend.
8786740	8787460	It was great.
8787460	8788500	It was fun.
8788500	8791220	Rob, you would have blended in perfectly.
8791220	8796180	There was a Rocky horror troop walking by, but I didn't get my camera ready in time.
8796180	8797460	But that's the thing.
8797460	8802500	But what I did was, I don't know if you've noticed, but a lot of conventions are having
8803140	8809460	Twitch panels on how to set up streamlabs, how to set up OBS, how to do your layouts
8809460	8810900	and all of this and all of that.
8810900	8813460	And people are just going nuts.
8813460	8814900	And streamlabs don't.
8817220	8818660	Well, you're right.
8819380	8821060	I'm Jamie.
8821060	8822740	I'm old school.
8822740	8825140	There are people who use USB microphones.
8825700	8827780	I have a mixer and I plug everything in.
8829460	8835300	Therefore, I did a panel called How to Podcast and Twitch Stream 101.
8835300	8842340	Basically, dear weebs, dear newbies, you want a podcast?
8842980	8844260	You want a Twitch stream?
8844980	8845700	Okay.
8845700	8847220	Get your wallets out.
8847220	8852100	I'm going to tell you how much money you're going to have to spend if you want to do this.
8852100	8853620	And that was the panel I did.
8853620	8855700	And it went over pretty well.
8855700	8856580	Congrats.
8856580	8860100	Although I firmly believe and not everybody's with me.
8860100	8862500	I firmly believe it takes zero dollars to podcast.
8863540	8864340	Well, that's right.
8865140	8869140	You might have to pay for your server space, I guess is probably the cost you really need.
8869140	8874020	But like, honestly, actually, you could do that whole trick with archive.org and all
8874020	8875140	that some people do.
8875140	8877300	You still need access to a computer.
8877300	8879620	You still need access to a microphone.
8880900	8882340	So it does cost money.
8883940	8890420	It may not cost a lot of money if you're going to have a very rudimentary podcast.
8890420	8890660	Yeah.
8891220	8896020	My point with all of that, because this topic has come up at Dragon Con, because there's
8896020	8898180	a whole track about this stuff at Dragon Con, right?
8898180	8899860	That's why I go there every year.
8899860	8907460	But is that more people get hung up on the what are we going to talk about in each and
8907460	8908660	every episode?
8908660	8915860	People get more hung up on that or I need to have all of this technical stuff so I can
8915860	8919540	get I if I don't have the perfect mic, if I don't have the perfect camera, I'm never
8919540	8920420	going to be able to do this.
8920420	8927140	People get hung up on that when the hardest part of podcasting is doing it every time
8927140	8928180	regularly.
8928180	8929380	That's the hardest part.
8930660	8932100	You want to know something with Twitch?
8932980	8935220	You don't need a camera to be a streamer.
8935220	8935720	Same.
8936340	8937060	And you want to know something?
8937060	8937940	We covered that.
8937940	8941700	Like in the beginning, I told people, you want a podcast?
8941700	8942660	Open up notes.
8942660	8944420	Start writing down ideas.
8944420	8945620	Create an outline.
8945620	8946500	Get this going.
8947220	8949460	Every episode doesn't have to be the same.
8949460	8950500	You can change.
8950500	8953460	I even use Orange Dodge Radio as an example.
8953460	8957940	I told people about Bemani DDR.
8957940	8963860	Let's just say people were were excited and there is a fan of the show in my panel.
8963860	8972340	So I explained how when DDR started going down, they switch gears and talked about gaming
8972340	8978100	and it's been going great ever since I talked about how you don't need the most expensive
8978100	8978980	equipment.
8978980	8983620	I said, look, if you have a PC headset and everybody that you're chatting online with
8983620	8984900	say you sound great.
8984900	8987300	Start with that and you go from there.
8987300	8988740	You want to record your show.
8988740	8990420	You don't have the money for audition.
8990420	8994020	There are free audio recording software applications out there.
8994020	8998500	Sometimes when you buy your your equipment, it comes with free recording software.
8998500	9005940	Like I did I did a review of a device and the company sent me another one to do another
9005940	9006580	review on.
9006580	9010900	This is a very simple audio interface, 60 bucks, and it works.
9010900	9015780	I think I think it's not like the literal like zero dollars to podcast, but it's more
9015780	9020420	the you would be surprised what you can do with what you already have or what you already
9020420	9021460	have access to.
9023140	9029700	So in that drawer of old tech and dig something out, I have a drawer right here and I could
9029700	9031220	podcast anything on.
9031220	9032500	I even forgot about this.
9032500	9035140	Bobby in chat says you don't even need a computer anymore.
9035780	9037860	Spreaker is a podcasting platform.
9037860	9039940	You literally call in with your phone.
9039940	9042420	You call it, do your stuff, hang up.
9042420	9044820	It makes an audio file and updates an RSS feed.
9044820	9046500	That's that's where we're at.
9046500	9051220	That's wild, but that you can even do it with landline landline.
9052100	9054340	I would personally rather sound good.
9056420	9062580	But I mean, and all of the software that I use, I mean, I've got training on it, which
9062580	9067380	is why I use Logic Pro and Final Cut for my video stuff.
9068020	9073140	But if you've got a Mac, you get iMovie for free, you get GarageBand for free.
9073140	9077300	And I can tell you right now that everything that I do in Logic, there are ways to do in
9077300	9078340	GarageBand.
9078340	9082740	You can do GarageBand on your phone or an iPad.
9083300	9089300	I know plenty of people who make all of their music, do all of their promo video and their
9089300	9091460	entire podcast from an iPad.
9093540	9095860	This is where the technology has gotten us.
9095860	9097300	I mean, it doesn't take much.
9097300	9102580	I mean, I used to upload my podcast to one site when it was published, update the RSS
9102580	9104580	feed, then post on the website.
9104580	9106020	I do everything through Anchor FM.
9106020	9107780	I upload it to there, they publish it.
9107780	9110420	I just grab the link, post it on the website.
9110420	9110660	Done.
9111380	9112100	Here's the thing.
9113060	9116660	And Bobby is bringing up the whole, if your audio is not good, then you shouldn't use
9116660	9119300	it to podcast because I've had to turn off podcasts.
9119300	9122500	I can't understand what people were saying because there were six people in a cavernous
9122500	9124580	room sitting around an omnidirectional mic.
9124580	9125300	Here's the thing.
9125940	9128500	That show that Bobby's talking about can always get better.
9129220	9135060	And as it continues to go on and they start to invest more time in it, they'll start
9135060	9138740	to get that equipment and do those sorts of things and so forth.
9138740	9140340	Those shows can always get better.
9140340	9141700	Here's what won't get better.
9141700	9143060	And this is the mistake.
9144100	9149380	If I were to write that clickbait article, number one or number of reasons, number three
9149380	9150020	will shock you.
9150020	9155300	Here's number three reason why people get into podcasts and then end up not doing it
9155300	9163460	is because if you spend $200 on a microphone, that $200 microphone is not going to stop
9163460	9166420	you from saying, you know what?
9166980	9171780	Let's record the podcast tomorrow because I'm going to go to the movies with my friends
9172580	9175140	and I want to go see my friends and I can only do that right now.
9176100	9177140	That $200 mic.
9177140	9181940	Now, actually, some personalities would say, but the $200 mic actually motivates me to
9181940	9183620	stay in and make that decision.
9183620	9184020	Fine.
9184020	9185140	You know if you're that type.
9185140	9190340	But for most people, I think you see what I'm getting at is that the most expensive
9190340	9194740	equipment in the world is not going to stop you from making a commitment to the recording.
9194740	9200740	And when people ask how has OLR been so successful, how has OLR lasted as long as it has?
9200740	9205940	Because it has gotten to a point where I don't know what else to do on Sunday nights.
9207860	9209540	Rob, there's also one more thing, though.
9209540	9210660	I like my ego to be fed.
9211780	9212340	What's that?
9214020	9214980	And a love.
9214980	9220660	That is something that I said in my presentation, whether it's podcasting or Twitch streaming.
9221220	9225300	Before you do any of it, you've got to have a love for it because let's be real.
9225300	9228020	You're not going to make money off of this right away.
9228020	9232340	There are those instances where you will jump right on and just start making money
9232340	9233540	hand over fist.
9233540	9235620	For some people, it takes time.
9235620	9236740	It builds up.
9238100	9243220	And we took, we fielded a lot of questions and a couple of them were, and I know we've
9243220	9249380	probably all been there, where what do you do when you get up and you just don't feel
9249380	9250420	like doing the show?
9252180	9257380	One of my co-hosts, Wild Spice, who's also on my show from time to time, she fielded
9257380	9261060	that pretty well because we also discussed mental health as well.
9261620	9266260	She said that she took, she stopped Twitch streaming for a couple of years because of
9266260	9266980	that.
9266980	9272180	And then she started building right back up and getting right back into it.
9272180	9277540	And I piggybacked off of that saying, as long as you have that feel, that love, you want
9277540	9278820	to do it, then you do it.
9278820	9280980	If you don't, then you don't.
9280980	9283220	It's perfectly okay to take a break.
9283220	9286980	If you hit that wall, just chill at the wall and relax.
9287060	9291540	If you're on social media, let the fans know you are taking a break because you got to
9291540	9292660	get yourself together.
9293380	9300820	And when you come back, and when you have a migraine, no stream night, and I have said
9300820	9307060	there have been times where I bring myself into doing this because I love it.
9307780	9309700	The day that I wake up and say, you know what?
9310260	9311860	This isn't fun anymore.
9311860	9313220	I'm wrapping up the show.
9313220	9315300	I'm probably going to end conventions.
9315300	9316340	I'm, I'm done.
9316580	9319140	I've hit where I'm like, I've done everything I wanted to do.
9319140	9320900	I don't want to do anything else more.
9320900	9325940	You know, and I guess it went over really well.
9325940	9331860	And I think a lot of people in that panel understood there's a lot more that you got
9331860	9335300	to do before you actually get into this.
9336260	9338500	And I think another and I'm sorry, just real quick.
9338500	9342020	Another thing, because and I see several people in chat talking about this, too, is that,
9342020	9344980	you know, I don't know what my Sunday nights were before the show.
9345060	9346180	This show had Matt.
9346180	9349540	Bobby says, I'm afraid to go to a life where I don't do something like this on Sunday.
9349540	9350340	It's like, I'll be fine.
9350340	9351780	I just don't want to get there.
9351780	9354740	And it's important to say, oh, it's not going to be around forever.
9354740	9356260	And I've said this a lot of times.
9356260	9358260	There is going to come a day when the show is going to end.
9358260	9359940	You know, it's going to happen.
9359940	9366340	And I realize it's ironic for me to say this, but I need to say this for everything.
9366980	9368980	It is okay for a podcast to end.
9369860	9372100	It does not mean you are a failure.
9372100	9374740	It does not mean your podcast was a failure.
9374740	9377220	It does not mean any of that was a failure.
9377220	9379460	You had moments.
9379460	9386180	You had that piece of art that you put out however many times you did it.
9386180	9389380	Five episodes, 50 episodes, 500 episodes.
9389380	9390900	You still have that.
9390900	9392500	That was a moment in time.
9392500	9394100	That was a moment in your life.
9394820	9395700	You're not a failure.
9395700	9398260	So pod culture says, I feel like one sometimes.
9398260	9403700	Well, let me tell you to stop because pod culture was a show that was on over 10 years.
9404340	9407620	And you had a lot of great things that came out of it.
9407620	9410580	You know, and plus it's not.
9413540	9419380	What I say is it in the moments that you feel like a failure or discouraged?
9420020	9422660	Actually, what I say is feel what you feel.
9422660	9424180	Your feelings are valid.
9424180	9430260	Do not ignore how you feel, but don't let how you feel limit you.
9431060	9431780	It will pass.
9432740	9435220	You just have to get up and get back on the horse.
9436020	9438580	And you're going to feel like shit for a while.
9439220	9443700	I feel like shit when I see one person on my stream.
9444340	9448500	And when I get an email that tells me to go to the kitchen to make a sandwich.
9448500	9449780	At least I did that one time.
9450660	9456100	But my point is, is that you can use that feeling to motivate you.
9456740	9458580	For me, I'm a very spiteful bitch.
9459460	9462260	And you know how I am when I get spiteful?
9462260	9463220	I make shit happen.
9465540	9467060	So let it motivate you.
9467060	9468180	Let it light a fire.
9468180	9473940	If you don't want to feel like that, try to do more of the things that will lead away from that.
9475860	9480020	I want to say, too, even though I said all that, I have had podcasts that have ended.
9480020	9482660	Just remember, y'all, I did Hoard House.
9482660	9484500	I did Pokestop Podcast.
9484500	9486580	I have had a lot of podcasts that ended.
9487380	9488660	And that's okay.
9489540	9491620	Tara and I had our comics podcast.
9492180	9492740	It's okay.
9494100	9495140	Sometimes podcasts end.
9497620	9502020	I think you also said, how do you motivate yourself when you don't feel like you're doing
9502020	9502980	the show?
9502980	9509220	And I say, try your very best to show up anyway, because the show might actually put you in
9509220	9510020	a better mood.
9510020	9512820	And I can't tell you how many times that's actually happened to me.
9512820	9516180	I did not want to do the show, but I said, I'm committed.
9516180	9517540	I don't break my commitments.
9517540	9518660	Let's do it.
9518660	9524900	I show up and you all being here and being as nice as you are, or we have a funny conversation
9524900	9526820	or whatever happens is a funny night.
9526820	9528020	And I'm like, you know what?
9528020	9531380	I'm glad I did it anyway, even though I wasn't feeling at the moment.
9531380	9534180	Now, some weeks are going to happen like last week.
9534820	9537300	And I'll just address that again and say, you know what?
9537300	9538660	There are going to be some nights.
9538660	9540500	You do show up because you have a commitment.
9540500	9541540	You do your thing.
9541540	9545060	But there comes a moment where you and this is literally what you all saw me.
9545060	9548180	I know you saw me go through this on air last night or last week.
9548180	9548980	Excuse me.
9548980	9550340	Is that mentally?
9550340	9557460	I literally hit a wall and said, if I continue to do this, I'm going to start to resent what
9557460	9558020	I'm doing.
9558580	9562500	Therefore, I need to stop so that I can come back next week.
9563220	9564820	And that's exactly what happened.
9564820	9565860	And I'm here this week.
9565860	9575380	And to kind of bring on top of that, during the pandemic, the height of it, somewhere
9575380	9580180	in there, there was I got a message from Marco.
9580180	9584100	She was like, I can't do the show tonight.
9584100	9585380	I really can't.
9585380	9587060	So I'm like, sure, no problem.
9587860	9588580	I'll message it.
9588580	9590900	You go and see if she wants to do the show.
9590900	9591780	I message her.
9592420	9593940	She's like, I can't.
9594260	9596340	I my face isn't ready.
9596340	9598580	I'm like, don't worry about it.
9598580	9599140	It's good.
9599140	9600420	So it's just me and Ari.
9600420	9604580	So I message Wild Spice.
9604580	9607860	She's like, I got to get up at five o'clock for work.
9608500	9611140	I said, and I'm starting to feel it.
9611780	9614580	And instead of getting frustrated, I said, you know what?
9615940	9616420	No show.
9617700	9619460	I posted on the Facebook page.
9620500	9621780	No show tonight.
9621780	9623460	Stay tuned for updates.
9623940	9628180	I messaged everybody and I said, how would y'all feel if we did a show Wednesday?
9628900	9630340	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
9631300	9631940	Updated it.
9632820	9636660	So episode Wednesday night, nine o'clock.
9636660	9637300	Come on by.
9638020	9644660	We did a show and we were actually raw and honest about why we didn't do a show Tuesday
9644660	9645300	night.
9645300	9650740	We spent a good time talking about mental health and how we just couldn't do it.
9650740	9652180	And I was discussing that.
9654420	9661060	As much as I would love to do an episode and if my friends, AK my staffers cannot do the
9661060	9663540	show, I am not going to force them.
9663540	9664820	I'm going to be like, you know what?
9664820	9666260	I'm flipping the switch.
9666260	9668500	I'm going to go jump on the Xbox for a while.
9669060	9670580	We'll come back tomorrow.
9670580	9674100	If that doesn't work, we'll come back next week.
9674100	9678500	And if people have a problem with it, they don't have to listen anymore.
9679220	9680900	This isn't a job.
9680900	9685300	And we still have to remember we have to do the things that we enjoy, you know, or the
9685300	9687060	commitments that are more important than this one.
9687060	9690980	Like next month, there's going to be a show that Jamie misses because she's doing something
9690980	9692980	special for herself for her birthday.
9692980	9694900	A person ought to be able to do that.
9694900	9696980	So, you know, the show will go on.
9697540	9702660	Loki is I don't know how much I should say about Loki's going to be out for something,
9702660	9704500	not doing something for something as well.
9704500	9705780	Yeah, not for something special.
9705780	9706740	Okay, that's all I'm going to say.
9707460	9709220	And it's one special.
9709220	9713460	It's it's one of those things, especially fun anyway.
9714100	9719140	But the show will go on and well, I could say more, but I'm not going to say Loki might
9719140	9723380	do the show anyway, but I'm just shouldn't go on.
9723380	9728340	So so anyway, my point is, is that it's it's this isn't our job.
9728340	9731060	And then again, it's that whole resentment when you start to feel.
9731700	9737300	But again, part of the reason why the show has been successful is because I do also have
9737300	9739620	that buy in from Dark Sakura and Loki.
9739620	9743780	And the three of us that have done this show for so long is that we know we're committed
9743780	9744580	to this show.
9745860	9751620	But sure, other things are going to come up once in a while, but it needs to be once in
9751620	9752420	a while.
9752420	9757380	And in your case, you know, once in a while is sometimes going to be, hey, I hit a mental
9757380	9758260	wall tonight.
9758260	9760740	I need to take a night for my mental health.
9761300	9763540	Okay, that's all right.
9763540	9764340	We'll try again next.
9764340	9766980	Or in your case, you ended up being able to do it the next night.
9766980	9770660	Again, you probably don't want to do that all that you don't want to live.
9770660	9771860	Let's do it Wednesday.
9772420	9777860	Have the that be the answer all the time, because then it's like your live audience
9777860	9779860	doesn't know what time to commit to you.
9779860	9780180	Right.
9780740	9784020	But as a one off special thing, we did it in this case.
9784020	9784660	Absolutely.
9785940	9786440	Yeah.
9787080	9795240	And before I wrap it up, someone in the audience wanted some advice on everything.
9795240	9800920	I'll tell you what is the best way I could describe doing a podcast, doing a Twitch stream,
9801640	9804040	the every investment, everything.
9804040	9806600	And I said, well, I could tell you this.
9806600	9813000	Now I have invested between upgrading my computer, my equipment and everything.
9813000	9818280	I said I haven't spent over $3,000 in the last three to four years.
9818280	9823800	And I have zero regrets because my computer, when it's done being a podcasting Twitch streaming
9823800	9825800	machine, it's a gaming machine.
9825800	9826360	It's a video.
9826360	9827400	It does a lot more things.
9827400	9830520	That's what I made sure of and to follow up with.
9830520	9833880	And I told them this is what I end my show with.
9833880	9836440	And maybe this will give you some motivation.
9837480	9838760	Hey, thank you for listening.
9838760	9840600	Thank you for participating.
9840600	9841640	I'm DJ Ron mess.
9841640	9842840	These are my co hosts.
9842840	9847080	We are independent podcasters, independent bloggers.
9847080	9848840	We do this for the fun of it.
9848840	9850520	What we like and don't like.
9850520	9852040	We're going to tell you upfront.
9852040	9854840	If you have any questions about the show, you can drop us a line.
9855560	9856600	Email address below.
9858680	9859180	All right.
9861080	9864440	Any other last thoughts for us, Rama, before we let you go?
9864440	9867320	And we anticipate the next episode of Anime Jam Session.
9867320	9868520	Congrats on the panel, by the way.
9868520	9869320	It sounds like it was great.
9869960	9870440	Thank you.
9870680	9874280	I will say I was inspired by you doing these panels.
9874280	9876920	And I felt that, you know, they're doing all these.
9878280	9881880	Someone needs to tell these kids how to do it.
9881880	9884520	You know, so figure out the Reeses keys.
9885080	9886040	Exactly.
9886600	9887800	Exactly.
9888520	9889480	All right, my friend.
9889480	9890360	I'm going to let you go.
9890360	9891400	Have a wonderful night.
9891400	9892760	Thanks for calling in tonight.
9892760	9894280	It's always good to hear from you.
9894280	9895240	You all take care.
9895240	9896840	I love every single one of you.
9896840	9897560	All right.
9897560	9898040	Love you too.
9898040	9898280	Bye.
9899160	9899660	Bye.
9900060	9900700	All right.
9900700	9903660	Always good to hear from our friend DJ Rama S.
9904540	9909340	In the meantime, I think we have probably hit about the end of everything we have tonight.
9909340	9910780	There's nobody else in the green room.
9910780	9913180	I think we've gotten through all the emails.
9913180	9916380	I will quickly look to Matt to see if there's any last minute stories.
9917420	9924060	I just want to mention that Epic and Fortnite have raised over 70 million dollars for Ukraine
9924060	9927260	because they're doing a fundraising thing with that.
9927260	9927820	That's great.
9928620	9934460	I'm sure much more fundraisers to come as this unfortunate issue just keeps going.
9934460	9939980	What ended up happening was that Epic had raised over 35 million dollars and then Xbox
9940860	9943260	decided that they're also going to match it, I believe.
9943980	9944940	So that's how it doubled.
9948220	9948700	All right.
9949660	9952860	Well, with that, we will move to wrap up the show.
9953420	9957980	Um, and before I get to final thoughts, let me say thank you as always for listening to
9957980	9959660	Orange Lawns Radio and participating with the show.

10000860	10003180	Dark Sakura, I know you want to get to the killings.
10003180	10004620	So I'll start with you and your final thought.
10005580	10013420	Um, I, I'm doing a birthday marathon on April 14th from 10 30 a.m. to 10 30 p.m.
10014060	10017500	Come hang out with me for my birthday on my channel.
10018140	10018540	The end.
10019660	10019980	All right.
10019980	10020860	Best of luck with that.
10021660	10022220	Thanks.
10022220	10022620	Bye.
10022620	10022940	All right.
10022940	10023180	Bye.
10024140	10024620	All right.
10024620	10026540	And we'll go over to Loki.
10026540	10027820	Your final thought tonight, Loki.
10028540	10032060	Uh, final thought is I've got to work hard to put out some more videos.
10032940	10033580	Mm hmm.
10033580	10035100	Hopefully those will be coming soon.
10035100	10035420	Yeah.
10035420	10039980	I really need to, um, get on producing more of that type of content too.
10039980	10043500	I keep meaning to, but you know, other things like the shows and stuff.
10043500	10047580	But speaking of shows, my final thought will be, uh, the next show I'll be hosting at the
10047580	10048780	end of April.
10048780	10050460	Um, it's not really a live event.
10050460	10054540	We're just, we're just doing basically a movie double feature with a costume contest,
10054540	10059660	but I'm really still excited about it because we're doing Goth Night Out and we're showing
10059660	10065100	The Crow and The Craft, which are two quintessential goth movies.
10065100	10066460	And I'm really excited about it.
10066460	10068460	So that's going to be a show at the end of April.
10068460	10072460	Um, the hosting gods have been very good to me this year and I'm so thankful for it.
10072460	10076300	Like, you know, between having John Waters a few weeks ago, unfortunately, Leslie and
10076300	10078380	Warren had to cancel on the clue thing.
10078380	10081900	Um, that was a bucket list item, but you know what, at the end of the day, the performance
10081900	10083100	was still awesome.
10083100	10084780	Hosting it was fantastic.
10084780	10086060	The audience was great.
10086060	10088060	I did something I rarely ever do.
10088620	10093420	And I actually wrote a little bit of standup to do, and it was all clue themed and it went
10093420	10094220	over well.
10094220	10096620	So that made me feel a little bit better about my abilities.
10096620	10099420	That's why my nails are black, by the way, because somebody was asking about that in
10099420	10103900	chat earlier is because, um, if you're not doing, if you, if you're not, what is the,
10103900	10105580	the line in the Alaska song?
10105580	10108140	If you're not doing nails, you're not doing drag.
10108140	10113100	And so I painted my nails and I was like, well, black, black nails I can keep, uh, for
10113100	10113420	a little bit.
10113420	10117180	It's not, you know, whatever, uh, fallout boy and all those bands they have, they started
10117180	10118220	that trend for men.
10118220	10118940	So it doesn't matter.
10118940	10119980	Have you ever painted your nails?
10119980	10120380	Loki?
10122140	10122780	No, no.
10123580	10124060	You know what?
10124060	10125420	Honestly, I'll say this.
10125420	10127660	If nothing else, paint them clear.
10127660	10130540	And I've done that because clear stopped me from biting them.
10130540	10133980	That's why that's, that's the one that clear nail polish will stop you from biting your
10133980	10134860	nails real quick.
10134860	10140140	So I would recommend that to anybody, um, regardless how you feel about colorful nail
10140140	10141340	polish on your own person.
10142060	10147500	Um, anyway, that is, uh, it's, we'll do this again next week.
10147500	10150140	Uh, I didn't mention this on the show.
10150140	10152380	I'm going to Las Vegas this weekend.
10152380	10154140	I will be back for OLR.
10154140	10157260	We're taking a Saturday flight back because it's cheaper.
10157260	10163180	Um, so, uh, we, with the state holiday on Thursday, we're kind of shifting our weekend
10163180	10168460	a little bit, but I'm very excited about it and I get to cross off my bucket list.
10168540	10173420	We're seeing Dionne Warwick live, and I'm so excited about that because I love Dionne
10173420	10176300	Warwick and her Twitter presence and all that is fantastic.
10176300	10179100	So, uh, I will tell you all about that next week.
10179100	10180620	All right, we're out of here.
10180620	10181900	It's a time to end the show.
10181900	10182780	Have a good night, everybody.
10182780	10183580	We'll see you next time.
