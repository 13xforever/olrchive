WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.040
Hot Take Warning!

00:10.040 --> 00:14.960
Gran Turismo has always been the most stunning, technical, beautiful simulation racing game

00:14.960 --> 00:15.960
on the market.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.760
It pushes the boundaries in a very specific way that other games comfortably nestle inside

00:19.760 --> 00:21.380
as they create their own vision.

00:21.380 --> 00:24.860
The increase in graphical fidelity hit a near-kappa generation ago.

00:24.860 --> 00:29.880
Every improvement now is miniscule or an ancillary detail like crowds, environment, etc.

00:29.880 --> 00:34.040
Meanwhile, Pokemon Arceus and Kirby have a choppy distance renderer.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.600
Give me more Nintendo, please.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.800
This is my opinion and you should have your own, but now it's time for your hosts, Rob

00:39.800 --> 00:43.360
Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about the actual Gran Turismo story and the

00:43.360 --> 00:46.360
rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every gamer has

00:46.360 --> 00:50.640
a voice.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.760
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:55.760 --> 00:58.440
where every gamer has a voice.

00:58.440 --> 01:06.680
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 907 of our

01:06.680 --> 01:14.720
show once again, I'll get into that in a minute, for this, tonight, March the 27th of 2022.

01:14.720 --> 01:20.680
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined, as usual, every Sunday night, whether there's

01:20.680 --> 01:24.240
a silly award show going on or not, with my co-hosts.

01:24.240 --> 01:27.080
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.080
Hi.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.520
How are you, Jamie Summers?

01:30.520 --> 01:31.520
I am.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.520
Yes.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.040
Uh, folks, uh, may notice that are watching live.

01:35.040 --> 01:40.280
The cam is broken tonight, unfortunately, so we don't see you, um, but we hear you discord

01:40.280 --> 01:41.800
just doesn't like to use it.

01:41.800 --> 01:42.800
Discord is broken.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.120
And we learned that last week, but I'll get into that in a moment.

01:46.120 --> 01:49.280
Um, also joining us tech master, Loki.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.280
Hello.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.280
Hi, Loki.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.280
How are you doing?

01:52.280 --> 01:53.280
Good.

01:53.280 --> 01:58.040
So I noticed the game playing behind you tonight is that new tiny Tina Wonderland game, right?

01:58.040 --> 01:59.040
It is.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.040
Yes.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.040
Yeah.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.040
Uh, so have you been able to check that out yet?

02:02.040 --> 02:08.560
No, I have not, uh, uh, I want to check it out even, which is funny because I'm not like

02:08.560 --> 02:12.240
super into Borderlands, but like the little bit that I've played at those games, I do

02:12.240 --> 02:13.380
enjoy them.

02:13.380 --> 02:18.680
And then I kind of like love the idea of the more like fantasy realm setting with that.

02:18.680 --> 02:23.120
So, um, it's a little bit more fancy, but it's, it seems pretty similar to Borderlands

02:23.120 --> 02:28.000
three, but yeah, it's certainly more fantasy, but not completely just fantasy.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Gotcha.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
All right.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.520
Uh, anyway, uh, let's get into the show.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.960
We'll get into our kickoff topic.

02:33.960 --> 02:34.960
Okay.

02:34.960 --> 02:39.320
So first let me talk about this because the podcast listeners noticed there was no podcast

02:39.320 --> 02:43.200
last week, even though we did have sort of a live show.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.460
So what happened?

02:44.460 --> 02:45.800
We didn't have a full live show.

02:45.800 --> 02:49.360
We had about maybe 20 minutes of a live show.

02:49.360 --> 02:53.600
Uh, we had so many problems with discord last week and I don't know what it was.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.400
Uh, I was not able to see Loki.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.400
I wasn't able to hear him.

02:56.400 --> 03:00.240
I couldn't hear dark Sakura, even though I knew that the cam issues were going on.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.560
I don't know what was happening, but it was a mess.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.260
It took us 15 minutes to get started with an actual show.

03:05.260 --> 03:07.560
And those of you that were here live saw the whole thing.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.580
It took us 15 minutes to get started live with an actual show.

03:10.580 --> 03:14.360
Then when the show started, I think we got maybe 20 minutes into it.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.000
And then more tech problems started happening where my co-host couldn't even hear me.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.700
And so I threw up my hands and I said, you know what?

03:20.700 --> 03:21.700
I can't deal with this.

03:21.700 --> 03:22.700
We're done.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.080
So I said, shut it down.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.080
So we did, and that was it for the night.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.080
And I was like, you know what?

03:29.080 --> 03:33.680
The 20 minutes that we recorded really wasn't enough for a podcast and it's kind of funky.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.560
So I'm just, I'm going to let it just be like a live only thing.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.600
And that's that.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.320
So if you're on the pipe and you're wondering what happened to the show, that's what happened

03:41.320 --> 03:42.320
to the show.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.320
We didn't have much of one.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.880
We only got through our kickoff topic.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.000
We had barely gotten into our gaming weeks and then we couldn't even hear each other

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
anymore.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.880
So that was pretty much what you missed.

03:51.880 --> 03:55.040
So we are redoing episode number 907 tonight.

03:55.040 --> 04:00.680
So that's why I said welcome to 907 again, because technically this is take two on episode

04:00.680 --> 04:04.300
907, but with all new stories from this week.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.760
So there you go.

04:05.760 --> 04:11.880
And hello in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where we do tape live every Sunday

04:11.880 --> 04:15.840
night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

04:15.840 --> 04:16.840
show.

04:16.840 --> 04:24.620
And looking in chat, I see a question coming in about why do you have to reload when the

04:24.620 --> 04:26.660
shows change?

04:26.660 --> 04:32.140
You don't always, so like when you're watching live, Bobby basically stops broadcasting from

04:32.140 --> 04:34.080
his Atlanta home office.

04:34.080 --> 04:38.940
And then I pick up the feed in my Sacramento home office because I have to change the title

04:38.940 --> 04:43.360
and all that stuff too, so that they save as two separate recordings.

04:43.360 --> 04:46.140
There really isn't a way for us to do that.

04:46.300 --> 04:51.420
We would have to literally remote into a central computer and it's just too much.

04:51.420 --> 04:57.620
However, most systems, as far as I know, pick up the new feed automatically.

04:57.620 --> 05:02.220
You don't usually have to stop all together, so I'm not sure why that is.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.860
I don't know if that's just a browser thing or whatever it is.

05:04.860 --> 05:05.860
I'm not sure.

05:05.860 --> 05:09.660
But just to answer that question, for the folks who are listening live, and I do see

05:09.660 --> 05:14.060
in chat that a hype train just started, y'all are so kind, thank you so much for that.

05:14.060 --> 05:21.140
You don't have to do that, especially after last week, but thank you very much for that.

05:21.140 --> 05:24.060
Let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight.

05:24.060 --> 05:25.540
Let's get into some gaming news.

05:25.540 --> 05:28.260
Maybe we could actually have some gaming discussions tonight.

05:28.260 --> 05:29.260
Let's do it.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.260
Loki, why don't you start us off?

05:30.260 --> 05:33.300
I mean, I guess we can.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.660
Or I could sit here and fight with Discord all night.

05:35.660 --> 05:36.660
You know what?

05:36.660 --> 05:40.760
I think it was, and it's, oh yeah, of course, this goes without saying.

05:40.760 --> 05:46.520
So we decide, okay, we're going to meet 30 minutes early tonight, I'll miss Bobby's show,

05:46.520 --> 05:50.840
we need to meet early, try to make sure everything works before we go live, look at the solutions

05:50.840 --> 05:52.160
if we have to go that way.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.320
And of course, we all get on Discord and what happens?

05:55.320 --> 05:57.160
Everything just works.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.300
Like it always has.

05:59.300 --> 06:02.080
Every other week we've done this.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.720
So what the fuck happened last week?

06:03.720 --> 06:05.480
I don't know.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.960
And my thought is, is it because Discord was getting DDoSed?

06:08.960 --> 06:10.580
Was it the server?

06:11.400 --> 06:13.660
Everything in gaming has been getting DDoSed lately.

06:13.660 --> 06:18.980
I know we have a story on it later, but I know Sony got, Microsoft within the last two

06:18.980 --> 06:22.100
weeks was like, everybody's getting DDoSed.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.920
Was Discord getting something?

06:23.920 --> 06:25.220
Was that why we couldn't see each other?

06:25.220 --> 06:26.220
I don't know.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.220
It's a mess.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.220
Anyway.

06:28.220 --> 06:29.220
So I throw it out there.

06:29.220 --> 06:31.860
Okay, Loki, you can talk games now.

06:31.860 --> 06:37.880
So we've been for the longest time hearing rumors and just speculating that, hey, Sony

06:37.880 --> 06:42.600
needs something to kind of compete with Game Pass that Microsoft has.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.780
And I guess that's supposed to be coming very soon.

06:47.780 --> 06:50.740
So they're saying that it could be revealed next week.

06:50.740 --> 06:54.860
The service has a code name, which I'm not going to say because it's stupid.

06:54.860 --> 06:59.880
And we don't need the spread, Spartacus.

06:59.880 --> 07:00.880
It's code name.

07:00.880 --> 07:01.880
I am Spartacus.

07:01.880 --> 07:06.760
It is not exciting enough to have a code name of Spartacus.

07:06.760 --> 07:12.880
It should be like, I don't know, code name Sion or something.

07:12.880 --> 07:17.200
Code name Sony Game Pass.

07:17.200 --> 07:22.760
I guess Sony late to the party got to copy what Game Pass does.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.600
Sony flicks.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.600
I don't know.

07:26.600 --> 07:31.360
So anyways, so yeah, they're going to put out some sort of service.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.480
There's something maybe streaming is going to be involved with it.

07:34.480 --> 07:38.320
It's a lot of speculation until the actual announcement comes out.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.880
So cool.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.920
It'll be coming at some point probably next week.

07:44.920 --> 07:49.200
I think what makes this interesting and why I know a lot of people are always iffy when

07:49.200 --> 07:53.480
it comes to reporting on rumors, but I think it's important to point out it's a lot of

07:53.480 --> 07:57.440
the investor websites that are running with this news.

07:57.440 --> 08:01.040
And that's why it's a little more like this isn't just like somebody's Twitter account.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.320
Like my uncle works at Sony.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.120
This is investor insider stuff.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.920
And one of the things that they did mention, though, out of the report is that the new

08:07.920 --> 08:15.120
service is not expected to have their big titles day one, unlike, you know, Game Pass,

08:15.120 --> 08:16.120
which does.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.120
Yeah.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.120
So.

08:18.120 --> 08:22.800
So basically, like, like one of the biggest sales angles of Game Pass, we already know

08:22.800 --> 08:27.640
Sony is not going to run with and that's the day one releases.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.660
It sounds I don't know if that's true.

08:29.660 --> 08:36.140
It sounds like Sony may rely on its back catalog a little more to bolster it all.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.140
And we'll see.

08:37.140 --> 08:38.140
We'll see.

08:38.140 --> 08:39.140
I don't know.

08:39.140 --> 08:40.140
They could.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.140
Yeah.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.140
Cool, but.

08:42.140 --> 08:47.900
You know, it seems like they're just putting a fresh coat of paint on PlayStation now.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.820
Well, PlayStation now sucks.

08:49.820 --> 08:50.820
Yeah.

08:50.820 --> 08:56.100
I mean, they needed to rebrand it, so I don't blame them necessarily for doing that.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.420
And they're saying that they're going to have different tiers, too.

08:59.420 --> 09:05.300
So they're like different tiers would include video games, streaming demos, back catalog

09:05.300 --> 09:06.300
games.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.300
So it sounds confusing.

09:07.300 --> 09:11.820
Like, honestly, like it's they're taking it and making it worse and more confusing.

09:11.820 --> 09:17.180
It sounds like because we're in multiple tiers, we're not going to have the day one games.

09:17.180 --> 09:20.460
It's like, OK, well, why bother?

09:20.460 --> 09:22.380
Like why even bother at that point?

09:22.380 --> 09:28.060
Well, I could see something interesting happening here, and that would be if Sony is going to

09:28.060 --> 09:29.860
leverage their back catalog.

09:29.860 --> 09:33.900
And this is I'm going to fully admit this is wishful thinking.

09:33.900 --> 09:40.420
OK, Sony does have the advantage over Microsoft that they have a richer back catalog going

09:40.420 --> 09:44.020
all the way back to the PlayStation one days.

09:44.020 --> 09:50.260
A lot of people back in the day said they wanted Nintendo to go the Netflix route.

09:50.260 --> 09:55.360
With their online stuff, Nintendo kind of did that, but still gets dragged over the

09:55.360 --> 09:59.480
coals for it because they don't exactly have enough.

09:59.480 --> 10:00.480
That's there.

10:00.480 --> 10:06.940
No, you know, and here I thought that they were copying Microsoft.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.240
They're copying Nintendo again.

10:08.240 --> 10:12.400
Well, no, I don't know if it's a Nintendo, but absolutely they're copying Nintendo game

10:12.400 --> 10:16.720
because what they're going to do is they're going to have libraries, a PlayStation, PlayStation

10:16.720 --> 10:20.080
two, PlayStation three that they're going to slowly trickle in stuff.

10:20.080 --> 10:26.680
But there'll be some games that will be locked up at the PlayStation plus plus whatever,

10:26.680 --> 10:31.120
you know, you have to pay for in order to get the the extra content in there.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.740
They're copying Nintendo.

10:32.740 --> 10:35.680
It's a Sony move.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.900
But here's here's the point I was trying to arrive at.

10:38.900 --> 10:44.840
What if Sony does it better and actually provides that full rich library out the gate?

10:44.840 --> 10:46.000
You're already disagreeing.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
No, no, they won't do better.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.400
Because and is it because well, and the thing that I think is holding Nintendo back is that

10:54.400 --> 10:58.760
Nintendo is pretty much put every first party game they can out on the service, at least

10:58.760 --> 11:02.320
as far as the NES and the SNES goes, like every first party game.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.600
I mean, I'm sure you all can think of an exception or two here or there, like maybe like, I would

11:05.600 --> 11:09.560
say one that sticks out for me is Illusion of Gaia, which I know they published in the

11:09.560 --> 11:13.520
US because they had the strategy guide in that that isn't on the Super Nintendo service

11:13.520 --> 11:15.600
and it ought to be.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.080
So there are exceptions.

11:17.080 --> 11:22.440
But I feel like a lot of third party stuff is what you know, and getting those agreements

11:22.440 --> 11:24.200
can be tough.

11:24.200 --> 11:29.160
I think that they're gonna see because I don't trust Sony to do the right thing here.

11:29.160 --> 11:35.560
The reason why is because we look at what they do as far as like their practices.

11:35.560 --> 11:42.320
So most a lot of games, no free upgrades, you have to pay additional money to upgrade

11:42.320 --> 11:46.560
it from like PlayStation four to PlayStation five type of thing.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.940
Their games cost more.

11:47.940 --> 11:54.840
They're charging $69.99 for their games, whereas Microsoft's charging 60.

11:54.840 --> 12:02.040
They I mean, have been very hesitant in the past to support backwards compatibility.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.760
They well, they did.

12:03.760 --> 12:07.440
They supported it, but you got to buy them again.

12:07.440 --> 12:08.440
Cool.

12:08.440 --> 12:17.040
They also have been stripping away the the free games that they offered in their PlayStation

12:17.040 --> 12:18.040
Plus.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.720
Remember, PlayStation Plus used to have like PlayStation three games, PSP games and all

12:21.720 --> 12:23.140
that kind of stuff.

12:23.140 --> 12:25.960
And yeah, they they stopped supporting those systems.

12:25.960 --> 12:33.600
But you can't tell me that a PlayStation four or five can't run a PSP game or handle PlayStation

12:33.600 --> 12:34.640
three game.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.080
I mean.

12:37.080 --> 12:41.080
It's just maybe, maybe not PlayStation for PlayStation five can handle PlayStation three

12:41.080 --> 12:42.080
game.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.780
And even then, yes, five has PS five has PS four backward compatibility built in.

12:45.780 --> 12:48.020
So it can it can play everything.

12:48.020 --> 12:50.040
I mean, yeah, like emulators.

12:50.040 --> 12:54.520
I know people go emotion engine like come on emulators are at the point where it can

12:54.520 --> 12:55.520
it can work.

12:55.520 --> 13:00.080
The only emotion engine that I'm feeling is the disappointment engine, because that's

13:00.080 --> 13:04.560
that's what I get with Sony is disappointment when it comes to supporting their fans.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.120
Do they make great first party games?

13:06.120 --> 13:07.120
Sure.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.280
They make great first party games.

13:09.280 --> 13:16.040
But you know, once again, that only goes so far, you know, to bolster a console, you really

13:16.040 --> 13:21.360
only looking at a handful of games that define this console versus some other console.

13:21.360 --> 13:25.160
So they really need to make this service attractive.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.440
Because otherwise, people aren't just going to give them the time of day.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.820
Not that they can't anyways, because you can't get a PlayStation five.

13:29.820 --> 13:34.580
But you know, it's just if they were going to like, say, Oh, we'll get a PlayStation

13:34.580 --> 13:38.600
four, and you can stream all this stuff or get these PlayStation five games somehow compatible

13:38.600 --> 13:39.600
with it.

13:39.600 --> 13:40.600
I don't know.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.500
But like, it's just, I don't expect much from them.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.480
So hopefully, they surprise me.

13:45.480 --> 13:48.860
They have you know, what they really should be doing is like, I understand that they're

13:48.860 --> 13:50.900
separate companies.

13:50.900 --> 13:55.100
Because the entertainment company is different from the movie company, but you are a movie

13:55.100 --> 13:56.100
studio.

13:56.260 --> 14:00.880
You spice up some of that with the movies?

14:00.880 --> 14:01.880
Why not?

14:01.880 --> 14:02.880
I mean, like that?

14:02.880 --> 14:07.200
Yeah, I remember talking about that a while ago is that Sony does have something that

14:07.200 --> 14:10.300
Microsoft doesn't have in that department.

14:10.300 --> 14:14.140
And that Sony could leverage their catalog of movies.

14:14.140 --> 14:17.420
Now and that I that would really change the conversation.

14:17.420 --> 14:24.620
I think if now it's PlayStation now is these games and you can stream I don't know Spider

14:24.620 --> 14:26.300
Man or is that now a Disney thing?

14:26.300 --> 14:27.300
I don't even know anymore.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.300
That's a Disney thing.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.300
Okay.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.300
Well, fucking it.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.300
Well, it's kind of in the weird.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.300
You can stream.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.300
Morbius.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.300
Okay.

14:34.300 --> 14:39.460
The Uncharted movie, for God's sake, obvious that you could stream the Uncharted movie

14:39.460 --> 14:44.340
and other things like within Sony's warehouse, you know, or and music.

14:44.340 --> 14:45.700
What if it was all of that?

14:45.700 --> 14:47.620
I think that would be the game changer.

14:47.620 --> 14:52.540
And that's where Sony has something that the other other kids in playground don't have.

14:52.540 --> 14:56.060
So it would be interesting to see if they were to actually leverage that.

14:56.060 --> 14:59.300
So let's see.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.620
Mike Deaf says Spider Man is Sony, not Disney.

15:01.620 --> 15:05.020
I know the rights are complicated there, but didn't ultimately that movie is streaming

15:05.020 --> 15:06.900
on Disney Plus, ultimately, isn't it?

15:06.900 --> 15:08.020
The far from home, whatever.

15:08.020 --> 15:09.940
I think that's where it's going.

15:09.940 --> 15:10.940
Yeah.

15:10.940 --> 15:13.100
So I don't know how they worked all that out.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.980
But streaming rights were probably a part of that.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.540
Oh, Bobby says, no, that's not how it worked.

15:16.540 --> 15:21.360
It's going to stars first stars with stars.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.480
There's too damn many streaming services.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.200
No one's going to stream it from the stars.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.600
I want to get to another question here.

15:27.600 --> 15:32.440
But first, let me say, I usually don't stop to acknowledge this, but I have to.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.780
Somebody anonymously cheered 1000 biddies.

15:34.780 --> 15:36.260
That is no small amount.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.060
So whoever you are, thank you very much.

15:38.060 --> 15:39.060
Thank you.

15:39.060 --> 15:44.860
Also no small amount, Bobby Blackwolf and Obi Wan Jabroni, five gift subs each.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.360
So thank you all.

15:47.360 --> 15:50.480
And there's I didn't even read all the other ones that were smaller cheers.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.480
Thank you.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.480
Thank you.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.480
I see you.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.480
I noticed you.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.480
And I'll read them all at the end of the show.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.480
Thank you so much for that.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.480
You don't have to.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.920
It's appreciated.

16:00.920 --> 16:06.600
With one of those cheers, actually, she helped 10 cheered 100 biddies and said the future

16:06.600 --> 16:11.480
is streaming games via Netflix style subscription.

16:11.480 --> 16:15.420
I kind of think I kind of think, yes, she's right.

16:15.420 --> 16:20.980
I mean, I feel like I've echoed some of this before, because where the movie industry goes,

16:20.980 --> 16:24.460
the game industry inevitably goes and this is absolutely where the movie industry is

16:24.460 --> 16:25.460
going.

16:25.460 --> 16:30.900
And I agree that's going to happen, just not with bandwidth caps.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.220
Yeah, no, I agree.

16:33.220 --> 16:38.500
The bandwidth cap issue has to give and, you know, obviously it's Comcast.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.060
It's well, and I guess there's other smaller.

16:41.060 --> 16:47.020
But if we could get more competition in that Internet space, but you're starting to see

16:47.020 --> 16:48.020
it.

16:48.020 --> 16:52.000
You know what I saw commercial for the other day, because somebody I know from the Twitch

16:52.000 --> 16:59.540
thing and on Twitter is a frickin spokesperson for this now, Verizon has these 5G boxes that

16:59.540 --> 17:02.460
you can get to get 5G on the go.

17:02.460 --> 17:07.300
Well, because it's not everywhere yet, but it's they're working on it.

17:07.300 --> 17:14.060
So Comcast Xfinity and all the other providers with data caps are going to have to worry

17:14.060 --> 17:15.960
about this competition coming soon.

17:15.960 --> 17:19.220
And again, not to toot my own horn, but I'm going to a little bit.

17:19.220 --> 17:22.940
I said this like a year ago, probably two years ago.

17:22.940 --> 17:29.580
There's going to come a time where 5G is in 90 plus percent of the country and cable is

17:29.580 --> 17:33.500
going to have to compete with that super fast over the air connection.

17:33.500 --> 17:39.480
And if mobile continues to offer unlimited plans because data caps are a myth anyway,

17:39.480 --> 17:41.740
that's where cable is going to get its competition.

17:41.740 --> 17:47.820
And I think once all that gets sorted out and now there's no more bandwidth caps, I

17:47.820 --> 17:54.360
think then that's where cloud gaming really starts to get its foot in the door and really

17:54.360 --> 17:57.620
start to take off.

17:57.620 --> 18:00.260
So let's see.

18:00.260 --> 18:05.440
Going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network as 100 Matt says, I think Sony would

18:05.440 --> 18:09.920
like to do that, but it depends on what Sony streaming deals has with other services.

18:09.920 --> 18:13.620
The obvious thing would be for there to be a Sony streaming service for its movies and

18:13.620 --> 18:14.620
shows.

18:14.620 --> 18:18.500
But in order for that to happen, they would have to void all their deals with other services,

18:18.500 --> 18:21.100
which isn't happening anytime soon.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.700
Maybe they could leverage something in their future deals.

18:24.700 --> 18:29.580
I don't know, maybe there's something where maybe you don't stream the movie so they get

18:29.580 --> 18:31.060
around it that way.

18:31.060 --> 18:35.660
But I remember a day and time when Sony sold movies right on their store, did they stop

18:35.660 --> 18:36.660
doing that?

18:36.660 --> 18:38.220
I thought they were going to at some point.

18:38.220 --> 18:39.220
I can't remember.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.420
Does Sony still sell stuff directly on their store?

18:41.420 --> 18:43.120
Like you can rent or buy?

18:43.120 --> 18:47.880
I thought they I thought they were going to stop, but I feel like they still do.

18:47.880 --> 18:52.700
So that might be how they get around it is you're not streaming it.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.140
You're renting it.

18:55.140 --> 19:01.820
As you can do with Sony stores since the PlayStation three days.

19:01.820 --> 19:05.700
Fifth Dream does point out, I've got 5G with no campus, my home Internet, and I'm in a

19:05.700 --> 19:07.780
tiny town.

19:07.780 --> 19:12.540
Mike Deaf says, don't we all already have 5G because we got the vaccine?

19:12.540 --> 19:15.380
I wish that were the case.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.900
And wants to point out, it's a joke, OK?

19:17.900 --> 19:18.900
It's a joke.

19:18.900 --> 19:19.900
But it was funny.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.540
I like that.

19:21.540 --> 19:22.540
Let's see.

19:22.540 --> 19:25.740
As Joe points out, Marvel had a deal with Netflix for the Marvel shows.

19:25.740 --> 19:28.100
I would like Jessica Jones and those.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.580
But when Disney Plus came along, they let those streaming deals on those shows licenses

19:31.580 --> 19:34.980
run out before putting them on Disney Plus.

19:34.980 --> 19:40.940
So anyway, it'll be interesting to see what picks up with this.

19:40.940 --> 19:44.340
I wonder if it will be true that we will see it this week.

19:44.340 --> 19:47.140
I guess stay tuned and find out.

19:47.140 --> 19:50.700
So we might be talking about this again next week when we have some facts.

19:50.700 --> 19:54.520
But until then, let's talk about the facts of our gaming weeks and the types of things

19:54.520 --> 19:56.140
that we've been playing this week.

19:56.140 --> 19:57.800
I will go to Dark Sakura first.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.860
How was your gaming week?

19:59.860 --> 20:03.420
It was it was pretty eventful.

20:03.420 --> 20:12.460
I in struggling mightily, I managed to get all of the killer adepts for Dead by Daylight.

20:12.460 --> 20:14.760
Some of them surprisingly quickly.

20:14.760 --> 20:20.380
I was super worried about getting Deathslinger because, well, he's pretty difficult for me

20:20.380 --> 20:21.940
to play effectively.

20:21.940 --> 20:28.820
And I got his adept on I played two games with him and got it on the first game.

20:28.820 --> 20:34.200
And so and then I got Bubba by basically playing super sweaty.

20:34.200 --> 20:39.340
But I was tired of him and I got him on Larry's of all of all site of all levels.

20:39.340 --> 20:48.900
So yay me and and then I finished Chrono Trigger.

20:48.900 --> 20:58.740
And I had that pull up on if I was going to do all the endings or if I was going to start

20:58.740 --> 20:59.740
a new game.

20:59.740 --> 21:02.460
So I just put it up a poll and apparently it will start a new game.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.540
So I put up three options.

21:04.540 --> 21:06.500
I put up Star Ocean.

21:06.500 --> 21:11.700
I put up Terranigma and I put up Seiken Densetsu 3 or Trials of Mana.

21:11.700 --> 21:15.000
And so Seiken Densetsu 3 won.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.980
And so I started that one last night.

21:17.980 --> 21:22.540
And booed at that because I voted for Terranigma and I was the first person to vote in that

21:22.540 --> 21:23.540
poll.

21:23.540 --> 21:24.540
Thank you very much.

21:24.540 --> 21:26.700
I took a screenshot and sent it to you and said, close it.

21:26.700 --> 21:27.700
I can't close it.

21:27.700 --> 21:28.700
It doesn't let you close it.

21:28.700 --> 21:29.700
I know.

21:29.700 --> 21:31.700
But come on.

21:31.700 --> 21:39.180
So but at any rate, the people have spoken, it was a pretty big margin.

21:39.180 --> 21:45.860
But that means that I'll be doing my next one to vote between Star Ocean and Terranigma

21:45.860 --> 21:50.100
and I'll probably will do Terranigma next.

21:50.100 --> 21:55.260
I just have to get and I'm not going to do everybody's playthrough for Seiken Densetsu

21:55.260 --> 21:56.260
3.

21:56.260 --> 22:04.380
I'm just doing Angela's playthrough just because Angela is absolutely ridiculous.

22:04.380 --> 22:11.780
And then yeah, that's that's really it.

22:11.780 --> 22:26.060
I also I've been trying to find a way to to get a version of Paprium, which I don't know

22:26.060 --> 22:40.460
if you know what Paprium is, but it's a fairly recent Sega Mega Drive slash Genesis release.

22:40.460 --> 22:46.260
But that it was it has like all these extra chips built into the the cartridge and everything.

22:46.260 --> 22:49.340
And it's this crazy cyberpunk beat them up.

22:49.340 --> 22:51.340
That sometimes works.

22:51.340 --> 22:55.020
It's had problems at a pretty long Kickstarter for it too.

22:55.020 --> 23:04.940
And some of the reviews out there are not super favorable as far as the the way it's

23:04.940 --> 23:08.980
been working or some of the glitching that's been going on in it.

23:08.980 --> 23:11.860
But I really I still really want to want to play it.

23:11.860 --> 23:18.060
So I'm working on trying to get my hands on a copy of Paprium one way or another.

23:18.060 --> 23:23.460
Bobby, I was just gonna say real quick, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I considered streaming

23:23.460 --> 23:27.620
the Live Alive SNES ROM, not trying to step on Jamie's toes, though.

23:27.620 --> 23:29.700
Well, I mean, that wasn't one of the options.

23:29.700 --> 23:34.020
And plus, as a streamer, like you're you're going to have to step on toes.

23:34.020 --> 23:36.660
There's only so many hours in the day and a lot of people that want to stream.

23:36.660 --> 23:38.820
So I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about that too much.

23:38.820 --> 23:41.220
Like, you know, play what's fun.

23:41.220 --> 23:45.300
On top of that, though, I am streaming games that I own.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.620
So there's that.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.820
To get to get out of that legal gray area.

23:50.820 --> 23:52.700
Yeah, I get it.

23:52.700 --> 23:53.700
Yeah.

23:53.700 --> 23:54.700
Yeah.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.860
My my copy of Seiken Densetsu 3 is somewhere.

23:57.860 --> 24:06.540
And I probably actually I think I still need to read to get myself another copy of Terranigma

24:06.540 --> 24:10.380
because I don't know what happened to my cartridge.

24:10.380 --> 24:12.020
I wonder if they're easy to acquire.

24:12.020 --> 24:13.020
I don't think they are.

24:13.020 --> 24:14.020
It might be a hard one.

24:14.020 --> 24:18.940
Yeah, I just and I know we've got we've got.

24:18.940 --> 24:23.620
If all else fails, you know, I do also, though, have Mother 3 and I might play a translated

24:23.620 --> 24:26.500
Mother 3, but it it depends.

24:26.500 --> 24:32.100
So but anyway, that's a that's my gaming week.

24:32.100 --> 24:38.100
Oh, and we had a crap load of pinball happening while I was trying to stream on Thursday.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.780
We hosted Pinball League.

24:39.780 --> 24:41.820
Oh, wow.

24:41.820 --> 24:45.740
A lot of people in my house, it was loud and thank God for noise canceling headphones.

24:45.740 --> 24:47.380
All right.

24:47.380 --> 24:49.180
Loki, we'll go to you.

24:49.180 --> 24:51.180
How is your gaming week?

24:51.180 --> 24:56.180
It's more Minecraft, as usual, you know, so I was doing a lot of video editing this week.

24:56.180 --> 25:00.700
I put out another episode of the Deep Dark World, which is doing all right.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.500
The first one's got a thousand views on it now, which is great.

25:03.500 --> 25:07.540
Second one, not as much, but, you know, it's fine.

25:07.540 --> 25:11.860
And then just working on my new NerdCraft episode right now, building a copper, a big

25:11.860 --> 25:12.860
copper farm.

25:12.860 --> 25:13.860
So.

25:13.860 --> 25:16.620
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

25:16.620 --> 25:17.620
Excellent.

25:17.620 --> 25:18.980
Well, good luck on your next video.

25:18.980 --> 25:21.180
Look forward to seeing it.

25:21.180 --> 25:26.860
Let's see my gaming week, honestly, not super exciting because I had a show last night.

25:26.860 --> 25:30.780
That's why I guess I'm not I'm turned the wrong way, but this is a very kind gift for

25:30.780 --> 25:35.560
my friend Genevieve, who came to the show last night, these flowers behind me.

25:35.560 --> 25:40.060
So we did we did a live stage production of the movie Clue, which is my favorite movie

25:40.060 --> 25:41.900
of all time.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.940
And I kept it kind of coy and under wraps.

25:43.940 --> 25:47.340
I had a surprise role in the in the production.

25:47.340 --> 25:51.860
I played Yvette, the maid, in the Clue production.

25:51.860 --> 25:52.860
And it was a lot of fun.

25:52.860 --> 25:53.860
We madame?

25:53.860 --> 25:54.860
We madame.

25:54.860 --> 25:57.580
I just want to powder my nose.

25:57.580 --> 26:00.860
So yeah, that was it was a lot of fun.

26:00.860 --> 26:04.160
Like the cast was amazing.

26:04.160 --> 26:07.740
And am I saying that just because I worked with them for all these rehearsals for a one

26:07.740 --> 26:09.360
night show?

26:09.360 --> 26:10.360
They are no.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.360
Well, yes and no.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.460
They are truly an amazing group, really.

26:13.460 --> 26:18.820
And I have to thank one of the other performers who played Miss Scarlet last night, Miss Mars,

26:18.820 --> 26:24.220
is really to thank for my makeup and my wig looking as great as they did because she's

26:24.220 --> 26:25.940
a hairstylist by day.

26:25.940 --> 26:31.160
And she was like, I can probably work with this and really made the look come full circle.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.460
So I'm very thankful to her for that.

26:33.460 --> 26:39.300
And just the whole- Did you feel gorgeous in fishnets?

26:39.300 --> 26:40.660
Yvette doesn't really wear fishnets.

26:40.660 --> 26:41.980
She wears black hosiery.

26:41.980 --> 26:45.020
I thought she wore fishnets for some reason.

26:45.020 --> 26:48.300
Because your traditional French maid look is fishnets.

26:48.300 --> 26:53.020
So it's one of your mind is one of those Mandela effect things where you assume she has them

26:53.020 --> 26:54.020
too.

26:54.060 --> 26:55.060
I'm sorry.

26:55.060 --> 26:56.060
So I had that.

26:56.060 --> 26:58.540
But yeah, I mean, it was fun.

26:58.540 --> 27:04.300
Oh, I also officially like I don't do these drag things very often, but I thought it would

27:04.300 --> 27:08.900
be fun to officially have a drag persona for when I do these things.

27:08.900 --> 27:11.960
And so I officially debuted Dale Satan.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.740
So D-A-Y-L-E-S-A-Y-T-O-N.

27:14.740 --> 27:17.460
And I think most of you can get the joke there.

27:17.460 --> 27:20.780
So Dale Satan is my name when I perform.

27:20.780 --> 27:22.340
But am I going to do that all the time?

27:22.340 --> 27:23.340
No.

27:23.340 --> 27:25.740
It's like a once a year for a funny show thing.

27:25.740 --> 27:27.480
But the show was great.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.480
We had a great time.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.480
Yeah.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.480
Is that isn't chat?

27:30.480 --> 27:31.480
Hey, is that was there.

27:31.480 --> 27:34.780
So ask is that whatever you want to ask about the show?

27:34.780 --> 27:35.780
Yeah.

27:35.780 --> 27:40.260
I would say I am so proud of the tech crew as well, because one of the things that they

27:40.260 --> 27:45.960
came through on that really and I think it might still be on the Instagram story at Amber

27:45.960 --> 27:47.840
Sweet Shadowcast.

27:47.840 --> 27:51.800
They actually rigged a full chandelier out of PVC pipe.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.980
So when a vet shoots the chandelier and it almost falls on top of Colonel Mustard, they

27:55.980 --> 27:59.200
actually had a chandelier that fell like we were at Phantom of the Opera.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.880
It was awesome.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.320
That chandelier got fucking wrecked the second time because it drops again in one of the

28:04.320 --> 28:05.320
endings.

28:05.320 --> 28:06.320
Spoiler alert.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.060
It got fucking wrecked the second time, but it happened.

28:08.060 --> 28:09.560
It was it was pretty great.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.560
Oh, yeah.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.000
Azet is talking about the guard dogs.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
OK.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.400
Actually, really funny story about that.

28:16.400 --> 28:21.300
So we have to double up on some roles to make that happen, because it's a very big cast.

28:21.300 --> 28:28.540
So the dog, the cook and the cop were all played by the same person.

28:28.540 --> 28:33.240
And originally and they I think they did the same performance.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.240
They use them, they pronounce.

28:34.240 --> 28:38.620
So I'm going to say they they did the same performance in twenty eighteen.

28:38.620 --> 28:46.180
I think they played the same role, but they use like a dog suit, like I go to like a bed.

28:46.180 --> 28:53.740
What do you the onesies that are Japanese inspired, Kiku Rumi, Kiku Rumi.

28:53.740 --> 28:54.740
That's it.

28:54.740 --> 28:55.740
OK.

28:55.740 --> 28:56.740
It was one of those, but a dog.

28:56.740 --> 28:59.780
And so they were going to do that again.

28:59.780 --> 29:04.260
And they were but they were having a hard time with the costume change because you have

29:04.260 --> 29:07.460
to get from the dog to the cook really fast.

29:07.460 --> 29:13.420
So somebody came up with the bright idea, like, oh, I have this dog puppet that would

29:13.420 --> 29:15.420
work great.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.380
And it was it was perfect.

29:17.380 --> 29:21.220
Like it literally looked like triumph, the insult comic doc.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.540
And so the dog.

29:22.540 --> 29:26.820
So they would just poke the dog hand out of the thing, go bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

29:26.820 --> 29:29.320
It was so fucking funny.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.420
Like that's the thing about that show.

29:31.420 --> 29:33.840
It's this movie is like thirty five years old.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.800
It's getting really old, OK?

29:35.800 --> 29:39.820
But like, it's still so funny every time I watch it.

29:39.820 --> 29:43.100
And just these little things that we were doing with the live performance to make it

29:43.100 --> 29:49.780
even funnier, like, you know, having a dude play a vet and having, you know, a puppet

29:49.780 --> 29:55.140
dog play the barking dogs that scare Mr. Body were just were just great.

29:55.140 --> 29:58.180
And I have to really compliment the person I'm sorry, I will get to video games.

29:58.180 --> 30:01.920
I just have to compliment our guy that played Mr. Body.

30:01.920 --> 30:09.300
He was so over the top sleazeball and did so good in the role that we thought, wouldn't

30:09.300 --> 30:12.940
it be funny if he also played the singing telegram girl?

30:12.940 --> 30:17.020
And so he did.

30:17.020 --> 30:22.740
And of course, played them completely different and like had these little like sparkling booty

30:22.740 --> 30:23.740
shorts for the end.

30:23.740 --> 30:28.500
Of course, the telegram girl scene always gets huge applause, huge applause.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.100
But it was it was the loudest this time I've ever heard it.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.100
It was great.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.100
I had so much fun.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.860
I really want them to do the show again.

30:34.860 --> 30:37.580
But it's probably going to be a show that's on a two year cycle.

30:37.580 --> 30:40.780
It's just it's such an ordeal to put on.

30:40.780 --> 30:44.060
It's harder than Rocky Horror, especially from a tech perspective.

30:44.060 --> 30:45.060
So anyway.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.060
All right.

30:46.060 --> 30:49.880
So as you can see, I can talk about that because that was my week, basically.

30:49.880 --> 30:51.260
But I did try to get in some games.

30:51.260 --> 30:53.020
I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.060
I'm still playing Death by Daylight.

30:55.060 --> 30:59.300
Like maybe I'm not streaming a lot like Dark Sakura, but I still play quite a bit.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.780
I still love Sadako as a killer.

31:01.780 --> 31:05.120
I've been getting bullied on her, but I don't care.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.980
Like I've been playing around with new builds.

31:06.980 --> 31:13.520
I have this build I really like where you use the add on that when the survivors heal

31:13.520 --> 31:16.940
each other, they transfer corruption to each other.

31:16.940 --> 31:19.940
And then you use the video add ons that they gain.

31:19.940 --> 31:21.360
That's like the ocean one, right?

31:21.360 --> 31:22.860
That just shows her eyeball.

31:22.860 --> 31:25.700
No, it's a no, no.

31:25.700 --> 31:26.700
Yeah.

31:26.700 --> 31:27.700
Yeah.

31:27.700 --> 31:28.700
The yellow add on is that.

31:28.700 --> 31:29.700
Yes.

31:29.700 --> 31:30.700
So.

31:30.700 --> 31:31.700
Yeah.

31:31.700 --> 31:32.700
So that's a fun build.

31:32.700 --> 31:36.680
So I like and then I just warp around to TVs to intentionally give people corruption.

31:36.680 --> 31:37.760
And it works pretty well.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.120
So there's that.

31:39.120 --> 31:42.280
And then I got my survivor to 50.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.920
I played her in Gideon's and that was an interesting experience.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.920
I always get fucking mid which with her and I don't know what it is.

31:49.920 --> 31:55.640
I either get the corn actually, I've only had the corn with her.

31:55.640 --> 32:00.720
And then I had Gideon's and that was actually pretty funny and Gideon's because you can

32:00.720 --> 32:03.080
use it to go upstairs and downstairs quickly.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.520
The Yeah.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.960
Is that is that the saw map?

32:05.960 --> 32:06.960
Is that the same thing?

32:06.960 --> 32:07.960
Yeah.

32:07.960 --> 32:08.960
The game?

32:08.960 --> 32:09.960
Okay.

32:09.960 --> 32:10.960
Yeah.

32:10.960 --> 32:11.960
Yeah.

32:11.960 --> 32:12.960
Yeah.

32:12.960 --> 32:13.960
Yeah.

32:13.960 --> 32:14.960
Because I was about to say that.

32:14.960 --> 32:15.960
Yeah.

32:15.960 --> 32:16.960
Okay.

32:16.960 --> 32:17.960
Yeah.

32:17.960 --> 32:18.960
So yeah.

32:18.960 --> 32:19.960
Kind of makes me miss Hawkins a little bit.

32:19.960 --> 32:20.960
The only other game that I really played a little bit of and I didn't actually play the

32:20.960 --> 32:21.960
game.

32:21.960 --> 32:22.960
I played the demo.

32:22.960 --> 32:23.960
So full disclosure.

32:23.960 --> 32:24.960
I played the stranger paradise final fantasy demo.

32:24.960 --> 32:25.960
Finally.

32:25.960 --> 32:26.960
Like I was like, Oh, I need to get around.

32:26.960 --> 32:27.960
I played this.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.840
I downloaded it on series X and I played it.

32:29.840 --> 32:33.400
And I got to admit the first five minutes, 10 minutes when I was going through the tutorial,

32:33.400 --> 32:35.840
I was like, I hate this.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.360
I really hate this.

32:37.360 --> 32:43.080
Like I do not like this at all, but like, and it's something about the battles where

32:43.080 --> 32:45.280
I'm just like this battle is yeah.

32:45.280 --> 32:48.320
It's DJ Rama S says in chat, the controls are God awful.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.280
Yes, they are.

32:50.280 --> 32:55.840
But when I was able to get away from playing the swords class and play the, I don't know

32:55.840 --> 32:58.600
if it's supposed to be like the pugilist or whatever, but you basically have the double

32:58.600 --> 33:01.240
knives much better.

33:01.240 --> 33:06.140
And then I got the mage unlocked much, much better playing that.

33:06.140 --> 33:08.200
So I did have fun playing the other jobs.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.440
So I haven't gotten the whole way through the demo yet somehow.

33:10.440 --> 33:12.740
I know I've just been playing like a little bit.

33:12.740 --> 33:16.960
I still don't love the battles, but I'm trying to see if it grows on me.

33:16.960 --> 33:22.040
I don't think it's going to $60 grow on me, but I think it might like $40 grow on me.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.320
We'll see.

33:23.320 --> 33:25.960
Quest Buster says Rob hates chaos.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.020
Okay.

33:27.020 --> 33:31.560
When those that have played the full game, tell me, is the demo literally the opening

33:31.560 --> 33:33.380
of the full game?

33:33.380 --> 33:39.220
Because like there's these things where he's just like, I swear to God, this is the plot.

33:39.220 --> 33:41.660
I got to kill chaos.

33:41.660 --> 33:46.660
I don't know why, but I just woke up and I had a vision that I have to kill chaos.

33:46.660 --> 33:47.660
What?

33:47.660 --> 33:49.140
You guys have to kill chaos too?

33:49.140 --> 33:53.260
Then we got to go kill chaos together.

33:53.260 --> 33:56.100
Like that is literally the plot of the game.

33:56.100 --> 33:59.480
And I'm like, is, is that like all the exposition you actually get?

33:59.480 --> 34:05.720
Because in some ways, like how fucking terrible, but in other ways it's like, it's so bad.

34:05.720 --> 34:06.780
It's kind of good.

34:06.780 --> 34:14.860
I'm like, is this a cleverly written parody about the story in 1980s video games and how

34:14.860 --> 34:17.700
there wasn't a lot of expedition exposition?

34:17.700 --> 34:20.020
And why are we killing this bad guy?

34:20.020 --> 34:25.980
Just because we feel like we have to bio shock twist, like what spoiler alert for a decade

34:25.980 --> 34:26.980
old game?

34:26.980 --> 34:29.740
Like what, what, what is going on here?

34:29.740 --> 34:35.500
Like Bobby Black Wolf says, I mean, it is a retelling of final fantasy one.

34:35.500 --> 34:41.140
I thought, yeah, that's why I was like, okay, is this just like a clever commentary on what

34:41.140 --> 34:45.060
we were told to do in video games in 1987?

34:45.060 --> 34:48.980
Fifth Dream in chat says, Rob just summed up 90% of the reviews of this game.

34:48.980 --> 34:49.980
It's terrible.

34:49.980 --> 34:50.980
It's great.

34:50.980 --> 34:54.240
Wait, what is it?

34:54.240 --> 34:58.720
Final fantasy origins, straight strangers of paradise.

34:58.720 --> 34:59.880
Oh that.

34:59.880 --> 35:00.880
Yeah.

35:00.880 --> 35:01.880
Yeah.

35:01.880 --> 35:02.880
I don't even know the actual name.

35:02.880 --> 35:03.880
Yes.

35:03.880 --> 35:08.960
It's team it's made by team Ninja because I was ready to say, Oh, this is very clearly

35:08.960 --> 35:13.440
done in final fantasy 15s engine, but I guess not because team Ninja did it and I don't

35:13.440 --> 35:14.820
know why they would have that engine.

35:14.820 --> 35:18.420
So I was like expect better of team Ninja.

35:18.420 --> 35:19.420
Do we though?

35:19.420 --> 35:21.240
Cause sometimes they miss the mark there.

35:21.240 --> 35:24.040
A lot of people really hated Metroid other M too.

35:24.040 --> 35:27.800
I didn't hate it as much as other people did, but I feel like team Ninja does some

35:27.800 --> 35:29.800
controversial stuff sometimes.

35:29.800 --> 35:34.640
So so let's see quest Buster and expect better of them.

35:34.640 --> 35:38.080
Quest Buster and chat says Rob's take is pretty accurate from the streamers.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.440
I've watched play the game.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.160
The story is whacked, but this gameplay is really good.

35:42.160 --> 35:47.060
I will say I saw a cut scene like spoiler alert, but is it really when the story is

35:47.060 --> 35:48.060
like this?

35:48.060 --> 35:53.980
Is it really like I saw this cut scene where like this boss is trying to introduce them

35:53.980 --> 35:54.980
himself.

35:54.980 --> 35:58.180
And he's like, I am lick the God of chaos.

35:58.180 --> 36:02.420
And the guy goes, I don't give a fuck who you are and jumps up and tries to punch him

36:02.420 --> 36:03.420
in the face.

36:03.420 --> 36:05.900
And then gets like bunched back.

36:05.900 --> 36:10.300
And I'm like, this is so ridiculous.

36:10.300 --> 36:13.700
Like I just, that would totally be me as a hero.

36:13.700 --> 36:17.020
It's like, did I ask who you were?

36:17.020 --> 36:18.020
I don't care.

36:18.020 --> 36:19.020
Get them away.

36:19.020 --> 36:23.480
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I just, Bobby Blackwell says, I just felt because I never played a

36:23.480 --> 36:24.480
souls game.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.080
I wasn't feeling the gameplay.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.080
Good news.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.400
There's a full on Bobby Blackwell mode.

36:29.400 --> 36:34.160
Like there's not only like casual difficulty, which is what I'm playing on, but then there's

36:34.160 --> 36:39.680
like easy casual on top of that, which I didn't even turn on, but Bobby, you could, and nobody's

36:39.680 --> 36:40.680
going to judge you.

36:40.680 --> 36:41.680
Nobody's going to know.

36:41.680 --> 36:47.680
Um, where like you just, you don't even like, I think your, your, uh, counter your, uh,

36:47.680 --> 36:50.400
party members never die in that mode.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.400
So yeah.

36:51.400 --> 36:52.400
Yeah.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.840
Oh, Bobby says it plays like a souls game.

36:53.840 --> 36:54.840
Yeah.

36:54.840 --> 36:55.840
It still does.

36:55.840 --> 36:56.840
It still does.

36:56.840 --> 36:57.840
I'll do that.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.840
Dark soccer.

36:58.840 --> 36:59.840
I, the demos free.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.720
You might want to consider just giving it a go for the laughs.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.600
Um, uh, oh wait.

37:04.600 --> 37:05.600
Oh shit.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.600
Yeah.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.320
You don't have a PS five or an Xbox series X, huh?

37:08.320 --> 37:11.320
And I don't think it's not, it's probably not on Stadia.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.620
I think it is on PC, but not Stadia.

37:13.620 --> 37:19.640
So I'll look at Stadia and there's actually a big, um, petition out to try to get, uh,

37:19.640 --> 37:22.600
um, Elden ring on, uh, on Stadia.

37:22.600 --> 37:29.680
I saw that and I would have signed it except I don't sign anything from change.org because

37:29.680 --> 37:35.940
once you do it, you get 50,000 fucking emails from them and you have to like unsubscribe

37:35.940 --> 37:37.760
several times before they'll believe you.

37:37.760 --> 37:38.760
Yeah.

37:38.760 --> 37:42.440
The mailing list sacred Jade and chat says squares, triple a game quality has suffered

37:42.440 --> 37:43.720
a lot in the last few years.

37:43.720 --> 37:44.720
I'm not going to disagree.

37:44.720 --> 37:48.960
I do want to remind this is, this is really a team Ninja game under, you know, but ultimately

37:48.960 --> 37:51.480
I guess square really kind of publishes it.

37:51.480 --> 37:58.200
Um, however, I choke about GP, which I think was on our list for last week when we didn't

37:58.200 --> 37:59.200
get around to it.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.320
Obviously choke about GP has not been faring so great either.

38:02.320 --> 38:05.280
And a lot of it has to do with the way they built the microtransaction system in that

38:05.280 --> 38:06.920
game, which is a little bit poopy.

38:06.920 --> 38:07.920
Caca.

38:07.920 --> 38:12.840
So, um, yeah, I did play, I would have talked about that during my gaming week last week

38:12.840 --> 38:15.280
because I did play the demo for that.

38:15.280 --> 38:18.160
I wasn't convinced to buy the full game.

38:18.160 --> 38:24.000
And that really says something considering like I loved chocobo racing on PS one.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.340
I'll defend that game.

38:25.340 --> 38:30.060
And honestly playing chocobo GP made me go, okay, is this a Rose colored glasses thing?

38:30.060 --> 38:31.560
It has to be right.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.560
I don't know.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.560
Anyway.

38:34.560 --> 38:35.560
All right.

38:35.560 --> 38:36.980
That was it for our gaming weeks.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.560
Let's move on and get, okay.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.240
Mike deaf says you're not the only one Rob.

38:40.240 --> 38:41.240
Yeah.

38:41.240 --> 38:43.200
So I know there's, there's other people that feel the same way I do.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.200
It's just very disappointing.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.200
All right.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.440
We have more gaming news to get into because we missed the news last week.

38:48.440 --> 38:49.480
Let's get into it.

38:49.480 --> 38:50.960
What is going on in the gaming world?

38:50.960 --> 38:51.960
Loki?

38:51.960 --> 38:57.320
Well, since you were speaking about chocobo GP, uh, let's talk about Gran Turismo seven,

38:57.320 --> 39:03.160
which also has horrible, um, microtransactions in their game.

39:03.160 --> 39:07.880
And so because of that, people aren't happy that a lot of the cars are only available

39:07.880 --> 39:12.060
if you purchase them through, um, this store.

39:12.060 --> 39:17.420
And apparently you can grind the currency in game, but obviously they made it really

39:17.420 --> 39:22.300
grindy because they want you to buy the currency, the buy it, you know?

39:22.300 --> 39:31.700
Uh, so the, the game has a score of 2.5 on Metacritic and, uh, obviously it's kind of

39:31.700 --> 39:40.300
getting back up, but you know, the point is that it's, uh, it's unnecessarily grindy.

39:40.300 --> 39:44.260
There's no very, not a lot of variation in the races.

39:44.260 --> 39:47.140
And it's just unfortunate that they don't get to have all the cars.

39:47.140 --> 39:50.300
That's why, I mean, like, was it not even like a week ago, there was a report about

39:50.300 --> 39:58.020
folks, um, creating a like script in like you, if you play remote play on your PC, there's

39:58.020 --> 40:02.420
a script that you can run that basically AFK grinds it for you.

40:02.420 --> 40:04.500
And that, you know, Sony wasn't happy about that.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.180
Well, don't make your games a damn grindy then.

40:07.260 --> 40:13.540
Um, and Sony apparently, or I should say polyphony, uh, digital will actually update the PlayStation

40:13.540 --> 40:16.060
four and PlayStation five versions of the game.

40:16.340 --> 40:22.580
Um, thanks to fan feedback, they've also given out 1 million free credits to each player.

40:22.580 --> 40:24.140
That's been affected by that.

40:24.620 --> 40:30.140
Um, and basically said, no, Hey, thank you for the continued support and feedback on

40:30.140 --> 40:31.060
grantor was seven.

40:31.060 --> 40:33.060
Your voices have not gone unheard.

40:33.580 --> 40:39.700
Um, and they would apologize for the frustration and confusion it caused by their patch, uh,

40:39.700 --> 40:45.020
last week or last updates, which resulted in, oh, and I forgot to mention another reason

40:45.020 --> 40:46.660
probably why that's been review bombed.

40:47.060 --> 40:53.220
It's, um, a game that has to be connected online all the time, even in single player.

40:53.420 --> 41:00.140
And so it was unplayable for a few days because Sony's services were down thanks to a DDoS

41:00.140 --> 41:00.620
attack.

41:01.180 --> 41:06.700
Um, and so, you know, not only was there the service outage, but they're adjusting the

41:06.700 --> 41:12.460
in-game economy, um, or they made adjustments to the in-game economy, which would made without

41:12.460 --> 41:13.220
clear explanation.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.980
So did they make it worse with a patch?

41:15.460 --> 41:17.340
Um, I don't know.

41:17.340 --> 41:22.620
That sounds horrible, but they're going to be doing a lot of different things to fix it.

41:22.660 --> 41:27.140
I just don't understand how they didn't know this was happening.

41:27.220 --> 41:30.060
Also, this was a game they charged $70 for on PlayStation five.

41:30.100 --> 41:30.900
So, you know,

41:32.740 --> 41:36.420
the whole money grabbing thing is disgusting.

41:37.140 --> 41:38.940
What happened to just making a game?

41:39.340 --> 41:40.580
Uh, Fortnite happened.

41:41.460 --> 41:45.180
And what I mean by that is that this is, this is loot box 2022.

41:45.260 --> 41:47.180
Now it's the season passes.

41:47.380 --> 41:48.260
It was rhetorical.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.260
But, but it's, it's worse though.

41:50.260 --> 41:54.500
And then I get it that Fortnite happened in Fortnite is a free to play game.

41:54.620 --> 41:58.540
The problem is these guys want, you know, money on both ends.

41:58.620 --> 42:01.900
You know, usually it used to be like, Hey, you pay for a game up front.

42:02.260 --> 42:06.580
You get the full game and that's that, or you have a free to play game and there's

42:06.580 --> 42:10.500
microtransactions in it because obviously they need money in order to run the game.

42:10.740 --> 42:16.580
But now these AAA studios figured out, Hey, we can, we can basically charge up

42:16.580 --> 42:21.860
front for this game and we can also charge microtransactions for additional things.

42:22.220 --> 42:26.660
Or, Hey, we can do this and we can design a game that be even grindier than it needs

42:26.660 --> 42:33.540
to be to push people into the microtransactions it's just, it's greed

42:33.620 --> 42:37.460
and, and it will eventually, you know, bite them in the butt, but

42:37.460 --> 42:39.260
well, it is look at the reception here.

42:39.260 --> 42:42.540
Look at the reception with chocobo GP, how many, like how many

42:42.540 --> 42:43.900
thousands of copies of this thing?

42:43.900 --> 42:46.580
I mean, they it's, it's chocobo GP.

42:46.580 --> 42:49.180
Like, I don't, no, one's learning a lesson.

42:49.180 --> 42:51.580
All they've learned is to like dial it back a little bit.

42:51.780 --> 42:54.500
You know, we'll just, we'll push it until they start complaining.

42:54.500 --> 42:55.300
We'll dial it back.

42:55.300 --> 42:58.540
They'll look at, Oh, look at how much better this game is because they dial it

42:58.540 --> 43:00.380
back and then they slowly move it back up again.

43:01.980 --> 43:06.100
You know, what's interesting, you know, a game that gets away with this charging for

43:06.100 --> 43:08.820
the game and then charge pay a debit daylight.

43:09.380 --> 43:10.140
It does it.

43:10.180 --> 43:12.300
They have their, their season passes in there.

43:12.820 --> 43:16.180
I think maybe part of the reason they're able to get away with it is twofold.

43:16.220 --> 43:19.620
One, even though, yes, it is like a $20 game.

43:19.660 --> 43:24.180
It's a $20 game, so it's not 60, but they also, they give it away so often.

43:24.260 --> 43:26.300
Like it was an Epic giveaway recently.

43:26.300 --> 43:27.700
It's on Xbox game pass.

43:27.900 --> 43:28.900
So they give it all away.

43:29.500 --> 43:29.940
Awesome.

43:29.940 --> 43:33.020
They give it away because they make most of their money in microtransactions.

43:33.020 --> 43:33.540
Exactly.

43:33.540 --> 43:39.300
No, but the other thing too, though, is that when you buy the, the season, you,

43:39.460 --> 43:44.060
it's not like you have to renew it and you don't have to buy it to get full

43:44.060 --> 43:45.140
enjoyment out of the game.

43:46.060 --> 43:46.660
That's true.

43:46.660 --> 43:48.580
You don't have to, it's, it's cosmic.

43:48.620 --> 43:50.380
It really is cosmetics only.

43:50.460 --> 43:52.500
They don't get any of the content behind it.

43:52.500 --> 43:53.620
So I guess maybe there is that.

43:53.660 --> 44:00.500
I'm referring to buying killers and survivors, which now survivors cosmetic,

44:00.500 --> 44:03.380
except for some of them are noisy than others, Jill Valentine.

44:03.420 --> 44:04.020
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:04.060 --> 44:09.340
Um, but I mean, I think the only actual value you get of buying anybody is going

44:09.340 --> 44:11.540
to be for the killers because the killers are all going to have different power

44:11.540 --> 44:17.300
sets, but then, you know, there's me who is a fashion whore and the only reason

44:17.300 --> 44:22.540
that my survivors exist is for, to put pretty clothes on them and I will, I'll

44:22.540 --> 44:23.260
buy outfits.

44:23.260 --> 44:25.140
I am, I am part of the problem in that.

44:27.020 --> 44:30.500
Well, I was going to say too, I'm like certain survivor talents are kind of

44:30.500 --> 44:35.380
mandatory, but the, the, the one that is like, you can get them in the shrine

44:35.380 --> 44:39.740
sometimes, sometimes rarely if you're lucky, but I was going to say bill borrow

44:39.740 --> 44:43.580
time is the only one I think of that's like a mandatory talent and bill out of

44:43.580 --> 44:48.020
the, um, out of the store, the shrine during the five-year anniversary event.

44:48.020 --> 44:50.260
So it's available like one week out of the year.

44:50.340 --> 44:51.340
No, I got it before that.

44:51.740 --> 44:54.580
And, and, and Dead Hard was available that way too.

44:55.420 --> 44:58.900
So, and to go back to like the, the Gran Turismo 7 thing.

44:58.900 --> 45:03.900
So here's the other shady thing about it is they altered the microtransactions

45:03.900 --> 45:07.020
and how grindy it was after the reviews came out.

45:07.900 --> 45:12.500
Yeah, that's the other thing is that you've, a lot of the, that Chocobo GP

45:12.500 --> 45:15.220
had that too, not to keep harping on that, but it is a recent example.

45:15.420 --> 45:19.020
A lot of that didn't show itself until after the reviews were coming out.

45:20.020 --> 45:24.020
You can't trust reviews anymore and not the reviewer's fault for a change.

45:24.020 --> 45:25.420
It's not that you can trust reviews.

45:25.420 --> 45:28.140
Yeah, you just can't trust AAA studios anymore.

45:28.140 --> 45:28.620
Yeah.

45:29.620 --> 45:30.140
Anyway.

45:30.500 --> 45:35.420
Well, speaking of changes, um, another game is having some controversial

45:35.420 --> 45:36.980
changes, but of a different sort.

45:37.260 --> 45:40.980
Um, this is Pokemon Go, which, you know, I've talked about, I've played quite

45:40.980 --> 45:44.620
a bit and, um, I just, I actually went on an hour walk today and I played a

45:44.620 --> 45:46.140
bit of Pokemon Go while I was out.

45:46.580 --> 45:52.580
Um, and, um, yeah, Pokemon Go talked about this week, their latest community day.

45:53.020 --> 45:55.820
Uh, community day is coming back for April.

45:55.820 --> 45:58.460
It's been around this whole time, even during the pandemic.

45:58.740 --> 46:02.340
Um, but they're doing the stuffle is the Pokemon that's coming out.

46:02.580 --> 46:07.140
This is new because this is the first time they're doing a community day for

46:07.140 --> 46:09.300
a Pokemon that has yet to be released.

46:09.500 --> 46:13.180
So, you know, they're just now getting into the, um, Alolan Pokemon,

46:13.500 --> 46:15.620
the Pokemon from a Pokemon X and Y.

46:15.740 --> 46:18.180
So this will be stuffles debut in the game.

46:18.220 --> 46:19.860
And it's a very cute little pink bear.

46:19.860 --> 46:22.020
So a lot of people want to get it fine.

46:22.260 --> 46:27.100
I think a lot of people are excited about the choice, but with this, they are

46:27.100 --> 46:33.020
reverting community days back to three hours, community days used to be a six

46:33.020 --> 46:35.060
hour window during the pandemic.

46:35.300 --> 46:39.300
And now they are reverting as they have started to revert other pre pandemic

46:39.300 --> 46:43.620
change or other pandemic changes back to their pre pandemic state.

46:44.100 --> 46:46.100
Um, there are other things that they have done.

46:46.140 --> 46:49.620
Uh, the incense change has been highly controversial.

46:49.860 --> 46:53.940
Uh, what happened during the pandemic, they made incense change so that you

46:53.940 --> 46:58.660
would get one Pokemon a minute, and now it's back to a Pokemon every five minutes.

46:59.300 --> 47:02.100
What I notice a lot of people don't report on with that.

47:02.100 --> 47:06.100
And I think to be fair to Niantic, that's if you're stationary.

47:06.740 --> 47:09.620
If you're moving, you spawn way more of them.

47:10.260 --> 47:14.260
So you do have to be moving and the incense will, and not everybody's

47:14.260 --> 47:14.900
reporting that.

47:14.900 --> 47:18.260
And I think, you know, no matter how you feel about the issue, you got to

47:18.260 --> 47:19.700
debate it with all the facts.

47:19.700 --> 47:21.620
And so they do spawn more if you're moving.

47:22.340 --> 47:26.900
Um, and then of course the, the change in the hours for Pokemon go community

47:26.900 --> 47:29.140
day is not very popular.

47:29.140 --> 47:33.220
Um, you know, I don't like it when a community day is a Sundays from two to

47:33.220 --> 47:36.580
five, cause then I can't really do them because of this show.

47:36.580 --> 47:41.460
Um, so, you know, the whole point is just to squeeze people into buying

47:41.460 --> 47:42.580
microtransactions.

47:42.580 --> 47:48.100
That's what it is because they're trying to feed the FOMO of these players that

47:48.100 --> 47:49.140
want this thing.

47:49.140 --> 47:52.900
And they're like, well, there's not a lot of time, you know, to get all the

47:52.900 --> 47:53.780
Pokemon that you want.

47:53.780 --> 47:57.700
So they're going to try to push you into the incense and push you into whatever

47:57.700 --> 48:01.780
that you want to, you know, pay for to be able to get it quicker.

48:01.780 --> 48:03.860
And so that's really what it is.

48:04.100 --> 48:08.100
They're squeezing players for more money because they're probably not making as

48:08.100 --> 48:08.980
much money.

48:08.980 --> 48:13.380
Now that people have gone back to work and are, you know, doing that type of

48:13.380 --> 48:13.700
stuff.

48:13.700 --> 48:17.460
And so I had a great solution to that.

48:17.460 --> 48:18.340
I just stopped playing.

48:20.660 --> 48:21.140
Yeah.

48:21.140 --> 48:24.660
Ultimately, if you're that upset about it, that's the only thing that's going to

48:24.660 --> 48:26.580
talk is to stop playing.

48:26.580 --> 48:31.780
Um, I, I, I just, yeah, I, I don't love the three hour windows.

48:31.780 --> 48:33.060
I also don't love that.

48:33.060 --> 48:38.100
They're trying to say, are players voice that this is what they want to happen

48:38.100 --> 48:42.100
because this is to get everybody out in the community together and all this.

48:42.100 --> 48:44.900
And I'm just kind of like shifting blame to somebody else.

48:44.900 --> 48:45.700
You're sorry.

48:45.700 --> 48:47.780
I, I would, I would agree.

48:47.780 --> 48:50.580
You mean people who work for Niantic that also play the game?

48:51.220 --> 48:58.180
I would, I would agree with the part of the statistic where probably people were

48:58.180 --> 49:02.740
only playing for three hours during that six hour window, but they were playing at

49:02.740 --> 49:04.420
a time that worked for them.

49:05.060 --> 49:06.260
And what's it going to hurt?

49:06.260 --> 49:07.060
Who cares?

49:07.060 --> 49:07.620
Yeah.

49:07.620 --> 49:08.660
What's it hurting then?

49:09.620 --> 49:11.700
Like you're not like flipping a server.

49:11.700 --> 49:14.980
You're not popping on another server or something like that to get this Pokemon

49:14.980 --> 49:15.220
out.

49:15.220 --> 49:16.980
It's just, it's a thing in a game.

49:16.980 --> 49:18.660
You're flipping a digital switch.

49:19.460 --> 49:24.340
You're, you're doing this to push people into microtransactions.

49:24.340 --> 49:26.340
That is why you're shortening the window.

49:26.900 --> 49:31.060
In my opinion, every community day should be modeled after what they do in December,

49:31.060 --> 49:36.100
where it's all weekend long that you have the increased spawn and then maybe your triple

49:36.100 --> 49:40.020
XP and Stardust and those sorts of bonuses are limited to a window.

49:40.020 --> 49:40.740
Fine.

49:40.740 --> 49:45.860
But at least the people aren't missing out on the Pokemon or worse, the special move

49:45.860 --> 49:49.780
that Pokemon only get during those times because they can't play during a certain window.

49:49.780 --> 49:52.340
I think there's gotta be an answer in there somewhere.

49:52.340 --> 49:54.260
Now, as far as the incense things goes,

49:55.220 --> 50:00.580
I think Niantic's biggest issue there was with communication because playing other big

50:00.580 --> 50:01.380
shock, right?

50:01.380 --> 50:06.500
Because playing other Niantic games like Ingress, there's been a very different tone to the

50:06.500 --> 50:08.740
communications about the pandemic changes.

50:08.740 --> 50:13.380
And that is that every three months or every month, even they're coming out and saying

50:13.380 --> 50:18.740
on a quarterly basis, we are reviewing these changes and we will re look and see when we're

50:18.740 --> 50:20.420
going to reverse these basically.

50:20.420 --> 50:23.060
And they basically list out this, this, this, and this.

50:23.620 --> 50:28.340
So they what they've done differently, in my opinion, is they have never set an expectation

50:28.340 --> 50:30.420
that these changes are going to be permanent.

50:30.420 --> 50:34.820
When they did these changes and Pokemon go much different tone, they set the expectation

50:34.820 --> 50:36.260
these changes will be permanent.

50:36.260 --> 50:38.900
And now the fan base is holding them accountable for that.

50:38.900 --> 50:41.060
Whereas an Ingress, they would be permanent.

50:41.060 --> 50:42.580
They never got that impression.

50:42.580 --> 50:48.020
Yeah, they said they said it in that original when I remember because it was the 80 meter

50:48.020 --> 50:52.340
distance thing specifically and they got called the fuck out on that and they had to revert

50:52.340 --> 50:52.980
it back.

50:52.980 --> 50:53.620
It was that.

50:54.660 --> 51:01.220
So with the with the whole incense thing, I understand that Niantic's whole thing is

51:01.220 --> 51:06.180
they are trying to build games where you need to go out in the real world and explore parks,

51:06.180 --> 51:08.020
explore areas and all this stuff.

51:08.580 --> 51:12.740
So I get why they're doing that type of change.

51:12.740 --> 51:17.300
I think they should have communicated a lot sooner and a lot better that these changes

51:17.300 --> 51:18.340
were always temporary.

51:18.900 --> 51:25.780
However, and this is a big however, there's still a larger conversation to be had about

51:25.780 --> 51:33.380
map in that game, the map updates and how Pokemon spawn, because I'm pretty sure how

51:33.380 --> 51:41.300
the Pokemon spawn is based off of an Ingress algorithm about how the Ingress XM spawns.

51:41.300 --> 51:48.980
I'm almost positive Pokemon spawn more more densely in areas that are densely populated

51:48.980 --> 51:54.660
with XM and Ingress, which is populated off of map data that is 10 years old.

51:55.540 --> 52:02.180
It's as old as the I am not talking about what the lines on the ground look like with

52:02.180 --> 52:03.860
the streets and everything.

52:03.860 --> 52:08.740
That's old, too, because that all comes off the open street map and Pokemon Go pulls that

52:08.740 --> 52:10.100
maybe once a year.

52:10.820 --> 52:16.180
All I know is that the park closest to where I live now doesn't exist in Pokemon Go.

52:16.180 --> 52:19.540
And that park has existed in open street maps for like two years.

52:20.180 --> 52:25.700
So I think Pokemon needs to be pulling in map data a little more frequently, but including

52:25.700 --> 52:26.580
the spawn points.

52:26.580 --> 52:31.460
What I'm trying to get to with Ingress is that like the population data that drives

52:31.460 --> 52:35.060
the score in Ingress has not been updated in 10 years.

52:36.020 --> 52:41.620
So, for example, a neighborhood here in the Sacramento area, Anatolia, you guys would

52:41.620 --> 52:42.260
know where that is.

52:42.260 --> 52:45.220
That's a new development out like sunrise and 50.

52:45.220 --> 52:45.940
Okay.

52:45.940 --> 52:53.300
If you were to field all of Anatolia, you'll get maybe 30 MU, meaning the map data thinks

52:53.300 --> 52:57.860
that 30 people live in that area, because when it was rural, there probably were 30

52:57.860 --> 52:59.380
people that lived in that area.

52:59.380 --> 53:02.260
But now there are thousands of people that live in that area.

53:02.900 --> 53:07.860
I'm illustrating that because that is the old map data that's causing Pokemon spawns

53:07.860 --> 53:09.380
to be stupid as well.

53:09.380 --> 53:15.460
And so I think Niantic needs to solve this problem of more regular map updates so that

53:15.460 --> 53:20.900
people feel like they're not seeing Pokemon when they go out and walk around, which is

53:20.900 --> 53:21.620
a very real issue.

53:21.620 --> 53:24.820
Anatolia has been there for like, how many years now?

53:25.460 --> 53:27.460
A part of it has, but it's gotten bigger.

53:27.460 --> 53:28.580
In at least like 5 to 10 years.

53:28.580 --> 53:30.580
Yeah, but it's gotten a lot bigger too.

53:31.300 --> 53:37.060
But Ingress is a 10 year old game, and that population data has literally never been updated.

53:37.700 --> 53:42.580
So Mike Def says the map actually got updated recently, but it's an area by area basis,

53:42.580 --> 53:44.260
but not the part I'm talking about.

53:45.140 --> 53:50.420
If you play Ingress and field new areas, you'll know exactly what I mean.

53:50.420 --> 53:55.300
And I'm telling you, everything that powers Pokemon go came out of Ingress.

53:56.100 --> 54:00.180
So there's one for one there.

54:00.260 --> 54:07.780
So anyway, SSG100Matt says there are times where Niantic gets on a moral high horse.

54:07.780 --> 54:11.620
They really want to stand on this high ground that our game is about moving around and we

54:11.620 --> 54:14.580
want to reward you for the moving around because exercise.

54:14.580 --> 54:18.340
Same thing happened when they cut the stop gym distance and they got rid of the 80 meter

54:18.340 --> 54:18.980
radius.

54:18.980 --> 54:21.380
People got upset about that and they had to reverse it.

54:22.340 --> 54:24.500
What does that say for people with disabilities?

54:24.500 --> 54:26.820
It's that people with disabilities can't move.

54:27.700 --> 54:28.020
Ever.

54:30.420 --> 54:35.780
Yeah, they're completely excluding an entire group of players who were probably thriving

54:35.780 --> 54:38.980
on having the COVID restrictions because it put them on more equal footing with other

54:38.980 --> 54:39.380
players.

54:40.180 --> 54:44.340
I would argue that there are a lot of games that exclude.

54:44.340 --> 54:46.180
I mean, what if somebody is blind?

54:46.180 --> 54:50.260
What if somebody is, you know, we've talked to people on this show that can't play certain

54:50.260 --> 54:51.700
games because they're blind.

54:51.700 --> 54:56.740
It is very hard to make a game that is accessible to 100% of the population.

54:56.820 --> 54:58.660
And it sucks.

54:58.660 --> 55:03.860
But that's, you know, and so the more we can do to make games accessible, then great.

55:03.860 --> 55:08.660
But I understand that the backbone of the game is being out and moving around and plenty

55:08.660 --> 55:13.380
of differently abled people can still get out and move around unless you are completely

55:13.380 --> 55:16.500
in a bedridden type of situation.

55:18.020 --> 55:23.380
But I think it's interesting that there isn't like an offline version of Pokemon Go because

55:23.380 --> 55:26.180
I would have thought they would have made a lot of money off of that at this point.

55:26.180 --> 55:29.380
But to be determined, I suppose.

55:30.820 --> 55:34.820
SG100 Mountain Chat says having six hour community days doesn't break the game.

55:34.820 --> 55:38.100
Having certain shiny rates at specific times doesn't break the game.

55:38.100 --> 55:39.780
Just be flexible with the community.

55:39.780 --> 55:41.140
That's all folks are asking.

55:42.260 --> 55:47.060
Yeah, I think that there should be a little more choice into, like, when you want to play

55:47.060 --> 55:48.180
that three hour window.

55:48.180 --> 55:54.260
And we know they can do phased events because that's what powers these virtual

55:56.580 --> 55:58.020
Go Fest and things like that.

55:58.580 --> 56:00.340
So anyway.

56:01.060 --> 56:05.380
All right, let's move on and talk about other old school franchises.

56:05.380 --> 56:06.020
Dark Sakura.

56:07.620 --> 56:12.340
Well, I'm sure that people who know their video game history are going to know what

56:12.340 --> 56:14.020
Colossal Cave Adventure is, right?

56:14.740 --> 56:25.700
It was a 1976 text adventure game, and it's actually being ported to a VR version by the

56:25.700 --> 56:27.140
founders of Sierra.

56:27.140 --> 56:29.780
That's Roberta and Ken Williams.

56:30.820 --> 56:34.260
They're doing this basically.

56:34.980 --> 56:39.860
Now, again, these are also the people that made, you know, King's Quest and Phantasmagoria,

56:39.860 --> 56:45.780
you know, basically like just the classics of our early gaming.

56:45.780 --> 56:55.860
But they're wanting to do a kind of like a real walking through adventure.

56:57.620 --> 57:04.260
Their new company is Cygnus Entertainment, and they have 12 full time employees working

57:04.260 --> 57:09.620
on the game, and they're not sure if they're going to do future games under Cygnus or if

57:09.620 --> 57:16.180
it's just going to be Colossal Cave 3D as the one, you know, the one time attempt.

57:16.180 --> 57:23.380
But looking at the trailer for it, it's actually really, really pretty.

57:24.980 --> 57:31.620
And it has like different elements from, you know, from the text adventure, but you're

57:31.620 --> 57:34.820
going around and actually working on it.

57:34.820 --> 57:37.060
So I think it's pretty, pretty neat.

57:37.860 --> 57:40.420
Now, I can't do VR at all.

57:40.420 --> 57:42.100
I mean, I could, but I will not.

57:43.220 --> 57:48.740
But looking at the trailer for it, it really seems like it's going to be, you know, just

57:48.740 --> 57:50.340
a complete full circle.

57:53.140 --> 57:59.140
You know, they've actually got on this thing that I'm reading, they're actually showing

57:59.140 --> 58:06.500
the text adventure running on a PDP, an old computer anyway.

58:07.140 --> 58:12.900
I don't remember the full model of it, but it's really just come a long way.

58:13.460 --> 58:15.540
I think that it's really awesome that they're doing that.

58:17.060 --> 58:24.740
Yeah, it's interesting because, you know, I get VR, like I have enjoyed it, you know,

58:24.740 --> 58:29.620
with things like Beat Saber, but I think there's a lot of VR stuff that just feels kind of

58:30.260 --> 58:33.620
like they're just shoving it in there because VR is like the cool new kid on the block.

58:34.340 --> 58:38.580
That being said, I'm very curious for Ken and Roberta Williams take on this because,

58:38.580 --> 58:41.860
again, these are folks that have been out of the industry for some time and been out

58:41.860 --> 58:44.500
traveling the world until they couldn't do that anymore.

58:44.500 --> 58:49.860
So I feel like it's an interesting, refreshing new take on this.

58:49.860 --> 58:54.100
And for whatever reason, they really feel like, you know, VR is the path for their game.

58:54.100 --> 58:58.180
And so it's interesting because it's a new take from a familiar place.

58:58.180 --> 59:02.980
And, you know, Ken and Roberta Williams were the very first that did a graphical

59:03.940 --> 59:07.300
the murder, I can't remember the name of the game, Murder House or whatever it was called.

59:07.300 --> 59:12.420
That first game that they did was like the first mystery house, the first graphical

59:12.420 --> 59:14.820
game that there was in an adventure sense.

59:15.620 --> 59:18.740
So it'd be interesting to see what their take is on VR.

59:18.740 --> 59:19.860
Mystery Quest.

59:19.860 --> 59:20.740
Mystery Quest?

59:20.740 --> 59:22.180
I thought it was something about a house.

59:22.180 --> 59:23.220
OK, but that's whatever.

59:24.180 --> 59:28.820
Well, there's also Mystery House, which is that current game that's out or Murder House

59:28.820 --> 59:29.460
or whatever.

59:29.460 --> 59:33.300
Yeah, that's it's like meant to look like an old ass game.

59:33.300 --> 59:33.620
Yeah.

59:33.620 --> 59:34.420
Yeah.

59:34.420 --> 59:37.780
So so I'm curious to see their take.

59:37.780 --> 59:41.140
Sierra also published like Leisure Suit Larry and Half Life.

59:41.140 --> 59:42.260
So I mean, yeah.

59:43.860 --> 59:44.500
Mystery House.

59:44.500 --> 59:46.500
OK, that was at the first Sierra game in 1980.

59:46.500 --> 59:49.540
OK, that was that was the one where it was like in the first like graphics.

59:49.540 --> 59:54.180
And I think Ken programmed it and Roberto wrote it, if I'm not mistaking.

59:54.180 --> 59:56.740
So, yeah, kind of anyway.

59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.980
But my point is, I'm just curious to see what, you know, grandpas take.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.900
And I mean that as a compliment.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.980
Their take on this is for VR.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:09.380
The only problem is I'm not buying an Oculus device to play it.

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:13.540
So I'll just have to hear about it through others and see, you know, the footage and

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:16.340
things like that or maybe play when I go to a friend's house.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:16.820
I don't know.

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:24.660
But I it's going to take me a lot, a lot to support Metta and the VR thing.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.820
I really don't want to be bothered with it.

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:31.060
So as long as that game remains exclusive to that, I guess I just have to hear about

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:31.700
it second hand.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:32.840
So.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:34.660
All right.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.220
Anyway.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:35.460
Yeah.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.860
And Bobby says nobody's buying an Oculus device now.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.300
They're Metta devices.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:39.780
Yeah.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.380
But we all know how I feel about.

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.460
Do I believe that company deserves to be called that?

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:49.460
You know, I'm going to they're lucky I talk about them at all, to be quite honest.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:50.500
All right.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.260
Moving on.

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.180
Something something a little different.

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:54.680
Logie.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.780
Yeah, we're never going to call them that.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.260
Sorry.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.540
You know, that's just the way it is.

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:01.880
So.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:08.740
Cyberpunk was a game that's been kind of rocky and they've been patching it and stuff.

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.820
But now that cyberpunk is kind of.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.700
In like kind of a holding pattern right now, it's time to start thinking about the next

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:23.700
Witcher game and CD Projekt Red has actually teased that there is the Witcher a new saga

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:30.500
begins that's being worked on on Unreal five as opposed to their own red engine.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:38.580
And you know, it's not necessarily they haven't really just said when it's coming out or

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:40.740
any details aside from a brief teaser.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:47.540
But we do know that they have promised pinky promised that they're not going to be crunching

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:52.420
this time, despite the fact that last time they crunched.

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:56.740
So they're promising, though, that they're not going to crunch their teams, but.

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.980
It's coming at some point.

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:08.340
I also find the news about their switch to Unreal five kind of interesting is it's

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:11.140
kind of like, are they trying to say that?

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:15.700
Because I feel like there's almost a similar battle going on at EA and the Frostbite engine.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:19.540
And like, you know, more companies are starting to be like, and maybe we should walk away

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:23.940
from our proprietary engines and just go with the industry standard unreal because it keeps

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:24.820
games on track.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:25.540
You know what I mean?

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:28.660
Like, I guess it makes it easier to bring an outside talent to I don't know.

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:31.460
Yeah, it might be easier for outside talent.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:36.340
You don't need to have so many, you know, designers working on the engine itself.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:42.100
You can just kind of, you know, add stuff to it, but not necessarily have to design

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.220
it from scratch.

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:47.140
Plus, it's probably their red engine is probably getting pretty old anyways, and they're

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:52.500
probably getting to the point where, OK, we need to update this for what we want to do

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.300
with the Witcher.

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.860
And, you know, let's say it's a few years out or whatever.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:00.580
I mean, it's just probably easier just to have somebody else working on the engine instead

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.260
of them working on the engine.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:08.100
So, yeah, yeah, maybe that's what led to some of the cyberpunk issues, you know, with all

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.340
the honestly, maybe.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:15.140
And that's kind of why I think that part of it is almost I mean, the news that they're

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:19.940
working on a new Witcher game, I mean, of course, but the news is going to be unreal

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:20.420
instead.

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:25.380
I think that's the very interesting part out of that quest buster in chat says the medallion

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:30.260
buried in snow in the teaser image appears to be that of the Lynx, another Witcher school

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.620
with ties to a new world kind of continent.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:37.860
So I mean, we might get a sense there, a hint about where the story is going.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.780
It'll be interesting.

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.860
I'll also be interested to see how it might tie into the very popular Netflix series,

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:48.740
which, you know, obviously is to thank, I think, a little bit for a lot of the Witcher's

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.220
success.

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:53.780
I mean, it's been mutually beneficial, the game and the Netflix show.

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.940
And yes, I know it's all based on a book to begin with.

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.180
So it's interesting.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:05.060
All right, moving on, let's talk about something that's coming back for next summer, because

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:07.700
last week we talked a little bit.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:13.300
I know it wasn't on the podcast, but the story we did talk about was that the EA thing was

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:15.300
not going to be coming back next summer.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:19.060
And it kind of led to a wider discussion on is E3 even going to come back?

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.460
And I'm pretty sure the answer is no at this point.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.660
But what is going to come back?

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:30.420
Valve's Steam Next Fest is going to be coming on June 13th and June 20th.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:36.420
And now to point out, there was just a spring version of this that just so it's not like

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:41.860
it's a once a year thing, but it's interesting in particular that week that they chose is

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:47.300
right around the time there would be an E3 type of thing and that they're already hyping

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:54.020
it getting underway at one o'clock Eastern on June 13th through June 20th.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:59.860
They are saying hundreds of game demos will be available for folks to check out live streams

01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.940
featuring teams working on titles.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:07.860
But we don't know exactly what games, of course, are going to be featured as of yet.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:14.100
We just know that past versions featured Sable, Toem, The Wandering Village, and so forth.

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.980
And I think this is very interesting because the story I'm looking at says the timing of

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:22.100
this means it will likely overlap with this year's E3.

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:26.900
While the Entertainment Software Association has yet to set a date for the annual conference,

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:29.540
it has historically taken place in early to mid June.

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.180
Well, I've got news, but it was last year.

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:33.940
Yeah, I've got news for the news guy.

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.780
There's not going to be an E3 this year.

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.660
I mean, sure, it's not official yet.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.220
So I could get proven wrong.

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:45.620
Fine.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:50.180
It wouldn't be the first time, but we're literally 10 weeks out, right?

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.380
We're coming up on April.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:56.020
Next week is going to be the first week of April, and we're talking mid June, two and

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:56.580
a half months.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.460
There's not going to be any three this year.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:05:59.960
Come on.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:02.980
And now EA just canceled their event.

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:03.860
Why did they do that?

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:06.420
There's not going to be any three next to it.

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:11.940
Anyway, let's move on to our Sacro.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:18.820
Well, you know, April is also, you know, my entire birthday.

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.620
It took a whole month for me to be born.

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:24.020
The entire month is how we celebrate your birthday.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.420
Yes, you make it extend for the whole period.

01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:26.920
Yes.

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:36.820
So as reported by the New York Times, Netflix is buying another video game studio to expand

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:40.340
their own fledgling video game services.

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:47.060
They announced this past Thursday that they were buying Boss Fight Entertainment.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.100
It's a small studio based in Allen, Texas.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:58.820
They are a mobile game developer with 130 employees, and they also have bought one called

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:04.820
Night School in September, and they also bought Next Games.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.420
They didn't say how much they paid for it.

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:13.460
But with bringing in all of these smaller studios, you know, a bunch of small things

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:14.900
can make up something pretty big.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:23.060
But the thing is, is that they're having to play a major catch-up game behind Google and

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:23.560
Amazon.

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:28.500
And now, you know, Amazon Luna is, I think, still in beta.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:34.820
I actually have a Luna account, but I mean, they're really trying to push into it.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:37.220
We'll see what they can do.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:42.900
I mean, I don't have a lot of hope at first, but then again, I love Stadia, so who knows?

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:49.380
Yeah, I feel like Netflix is really trying to find its place at this table.

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:54.580
And it's interesting because we see video games trying to find their space in the cloud.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:59.220
And now we see the cloud success story in the movie department anyway, trying to find

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.420
its place in the cloud.

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:06.340
And I feel like that is not going so smoothly, but acquisitions like this will probably help

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:07.460
move them in the right direction.

01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:09.460
So we'll see.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:14.900
It's certainly interesting that this is the path that they're choosing to go as opposed

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:19.700
to expanding, you know, organically their own numbers.

01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:24.020
Stu and Hunter Matt in chat says, I wonder what the next three years will look like when

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:25.060
Netflix games.

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:27.620
I wonder what the next three years are going to look like for the service.

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:32.500
They've been losing a lot of stuff, but they still manage to keep a lot of shows that people

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.060
are talking about.

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:35.380
Like what Bridgerton is kind of the big thing right now.

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:38.900
So a Stranger Things will be back at some point, which even I like that one.

01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:40.500
So I don't watch a lot of TV.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.620
I'll watch that.

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:45.140
So maybe they do have some things still going for it.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:45.700
Pretty good.

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:47.880
All right.

01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:50.260
I have a question for you.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:51.620
I have a question for you.

01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:52.360
So.

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:53.800
All right.

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.460
I'm still, I don't know.

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.300
I get a little bit irritated thinking about it.

01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:00.440
How so?

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:12.420
Just in general, I would really, I think that, I just think that they're coming in too late

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:16.420
to a game, to a game, huh?

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:19.860
That's been pioneered by people who are better prepared for it.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:27.540
I think that, and to kind of bring things back full circle, the top of the show, I think

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:31.940
that's a lot of concern people have about Sony and that game pass model is that they're

01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:35.140
showing up late to a party that they should have been at a long time ago.

01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:36.740
But I don't know.

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.100
This isn't fashionably late.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.980
This is, oh, you're cleaning up the cheese dip.

01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:41.480
I'm sorry.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.980
But Bobby does make a point in chat.

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.420
It's not always about who's first.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.540
It's about who does it the best.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.140
That's certainly the case when it comes to a lot of stuff.

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.260
So we'll see.

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:55.940
I just don't know if Netflix has, I don't know.

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:57.940
I feel like Netflix should stick at what they're good at.

01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:01.140
And that's original programming and canceling shows before their prime.

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:07.380
But anyway, all right, let's move on.

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:07.880
Logie.

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:12.260
So this is kind of interesting.

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:20.900
There's been some folks, Harbor Masters, who are developers that designed a kind of a weird

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:24.100
like shell that plays Ocarina of Time on PC.

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:30.580
So basically, they're trying to get around a takedown notice from Nintendo.

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:36.820
So what they've done is they basically fans have reverse engineered the code from Ocarina

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:37.700
of Time and to see.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:41.300
And so they've been able to port it to the PC.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.700
But in order to play this, you actually have to have us.

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:48.580
It reads the code from a separate ROM file to kind of think of almost like a ROM patch

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.900
or something like that, except it's not actually patching the ROM.

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:53.140
It's just reading the ROM separately.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:59.220
I guess I'd almost be like an emulator, but you can't include the BIOS or codes because

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:00.980
that's what's copyrighted type of thing.

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:02.260
I don't know.

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:06.740
But anyway, so now Ocarina of Time is available to play on PC, assuming you have the ROM

01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:13.380
ROM, and it supports different mods as well, including like HD models, texture packs, online

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:16.100
play, Linux and Mac support, stuff like that.

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.300
Ultra wide, if you want to do that.

01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:24.500
This is fascinating to me that this hasn't been yanked by Nintendo somehow yet.

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:28.820
And the way that I mean, yes, I completely heard what you said about how it works and

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:33.300
the fact that like it doesn't actually have a ROM in it so that there's no actual assets

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:33.940
in it.

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:36.660
Although wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.380
People know before people know where to find them.

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:44.900
You know, it's just it's just interesting that it creates a legal quandary for Nintendo

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.660
as to can they shut it down?

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:48.980
I will try.

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.660
They're probably going to try.

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:54.580
They're going to have to do it anyways, because they're a big company.

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.220
And if it's a small individual, what are they going to do?

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.300
Counter Sue all the money to do that.

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.740
Nintendo is a big company.

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:03.460
Plus, the problem is right before now it's on the Internet.

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:05.700
You know, and that's at the end of the day, it's on the Internet.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:06.900
It's always going to be on the Internet.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:11.940
When I was looking into this before, apparently you also have to have a particular version

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:19.700
of it where it's before it's pre Master Quest mode and also that it has to have a certain

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:20.500
debug version.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.140
For some of the the current stuff to run on it.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:25.860
Interesting.

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:29.940
I wonder, I bet here's here's the thing I'd be worried about, because I bet there's a

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:31.860
lot of people interested in streaming this.

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:35.780
I bet Nintendo yanks the shit out of those YouTube.

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.380
I don't know if they can stop Twitch.

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.500
It's a lot harder.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.460
They could probably find a way.

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:41.940
I bet Nintendo starts yanking the shit out of those YouTubes.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.260
We've seen them do that kind of thing before.

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.420
I'd be very curious to see.

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:51.380
So but I think but the idea is so cool.

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:53.860
Like I like that all that stuff aside.

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:58.260
I'm like, wow, playing Ocarina of Time, like on a widescreen monitor on the computer is

01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.620
like, oh, I love that.

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:06.340
Like I it just it just makes you go, gosh, if only Nintendo could do this themselves

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:13.540
for their beloved games, but they don't want to take a clue from the stuff that Valve was

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:19.540
doing before in hiring the people who are making these these things to bring out what

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:24.020
what people actually want, you know, say, oh, these are talented people.

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.020
They're already making this happen.

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:28.900
Let's pay them to make it happen and give people what they want.

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:31.380
I'm going to agree with that.

01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:36.660
I mean, I understand, you know, Nintendo being a Japanese company, probably the culture's

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:37.700
a little different.

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:41.220
And but I mean, at the end of the day, good business is good business.

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.300
And I think Valve built their business on that.

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:45.220
And that's why they're as successful as they are.

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:48.180
So now if only they could count to three.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.360
Fair.

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:51.880
All right.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:56.020
Well, speaking of Nintendo, lol, just Nintendo things.

01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:04.020
Let's talk about the latest update for the switch, because there was a system software

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.100
upgrade firmware for the switch.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:14.740
And it's now up to version 14.0, if you can believe it, which adds groups to the home

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:15.240
page.

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:17.060
It's a folder system.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:23.540
So finally, you have a way to build folders, excuse me, groups out of all of the games

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:27.300
that you've accumulated on your screen, because most of you probably have so much stuff on

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:27.780
your switch.

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:32.020
Now, it doesn't fit just on one bar, you have to go to that screen where you're looking

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:34.020
at everything on there.

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:40.500
So yeah, so it's led to a lot of people commenting the lol folders late to the party.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:43.780
But then at the same time, a lot of people are like, but I'm using it.

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:46.420
And like I organized all my games and all that stuff.

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:50.820
So you can make up to 100 groups and you can have up to 200 titles per group.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.260
I can't imagine anyone's going to actually hit that number without them intentionally

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:54.660
trying.

01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:03.620
Also, you can only see the all software screen if you have more than 13 software icons.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.820
I find that interesting.

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:06.580
I wonder why they changed that, but okay.

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:10.340
Also, they've updated Bluetooth audio.

01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:16.740
You can adjust the volume of Bluetooth audio using either the switch console or your Bluetooth

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:17.620
audio device.

01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:18.820
Woohoo for that.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:23.460
So that's the big Nintendo system update.

01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:30.420
And let's see, looking in chat, Mike Def says, For fuck's sake, the Wii U does folders

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:30.820
better.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:36.260
Sj100Matt says, We got folder and two choices of colors and themes.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:40.020
Mike Def says, It's something at least, but it should have been better.

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.860
And Orange Right says, Better late than never.

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:48.980
I mean, can't Nintendo just change the look of the I mean, they would never do it.

01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:52.340
I'm like, can't they just, like, really overhaul the look at the switch interface,

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.780
but they would never do it.

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:57.140
Only Microsoft does things that are that nutty.

01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:02.420
Like, if you think about the 360 and, like, the radical changes the 360 interface went

01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:04.980
through, remember the blades, the initial interface?

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:05.940
It wasn't that bad.

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.420
I mean, for its time, it wasn't that bad.

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.580
And then they, like, completely redid it.

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:14.260
It looked like a new console when they redid it around the time Kinect came out.

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:15.700
Something else.

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:17.700
All right.

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:24.660
Anyway, let's go back to a simpler time when we weren't so concerned with the interfaces

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:26.900
on the system, because there wasn't any.

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.740
You would plug in your cartridge and go.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.420
Not this one.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.380
You've been listening.

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:32.260
Not that one.

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:33.060
Not that button.

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:35.300
That's the wrong button.

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:36.660
That's the button that ends the show.

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:38.580
Let's try.

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:39.060
Game over.

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:39.380
Bye.

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:42.340
Let's try this button instead.

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:58.580
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.900
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.540
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:10.340
And yes, DarkSakura, like you were saying, this isn't really a pick tonight that is about

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.220
an old system.

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:17.540
In fact, this is one of those picks where I'm going, this is 10 years old.

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:18.260
It's honest.

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:19.220
It's 10 years old.

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:20.180
Really?

01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:21.940
I can't handle it.

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:22.500
What did you pick?

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:24.580
I picked Mass Effect 3.

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:26.820
Now we've done them all.

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:34.500
It is almost exactly, almost exactly 10 years.

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:40.980
Well, I meant I would have been doing it closer to the 10 year mark, but so it came out on

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:42.980
March 6, 2012.

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:50.580
And it's a action RPG developed by Bioware published by Electronic Arts and it is the

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:53.780
third in the Mass Effect original trilogy.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:59.700
It's the final one in that it was released for Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:02.180
PlayStation, PlayStation 3.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:08.740
There was a Wii U version entitled Mass Effect 3 Special Edition released in November, 2012.

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:16.020
So the game is set in the Milky Way Galaxy in 2186 and the Reapers are coming.

01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.580
And this time the Reapers came.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.820
And this time the Reapers came.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:22.820
You opened the box.

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.660
Sorry, wrong game.

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:30.900
Anyway, you can import your save file from Mass Effect 2 and keep going.

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:40.660
It also, instead of some of the previous things that went into Mass Effect 2, this one has

01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:45.860
a lot more involved increasing your military strength by completing your missions, gathering

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:46.660
your resources.

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:51.540
And it does have, though, much of the similar gameplay from Mass Effect 2.

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:54.820
Both of those were changed from the first Mass Effect.

01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:00.820
You know, you got your cover based shooting and the altered person, things like that.

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:04.580
The multiplayer component, I miss it.

01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:08.020
I miss Mass Effect multiplayer so much.

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.540
We did a lot of that, Rob.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:12.200
Remember?

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:14.660
Okay, Rob's gone.

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:25.300
Anyway, it also had a bunch of DLC and some of the DLC was, like, significantly epic.

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:32.420
So at any rate, yeah, and Questbuster, I agree.

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:34.980
Garris has never left my team because Garris.

01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:37.300
The voice.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:41.380
So moving into a little bit more about it.

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:47.700
So, like I said, you can import your game file for Mass Effect 2.

01:19:48.420 --> 01:20:01.220
You can go on the Galaxy map and choose where you're going to go.

01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.420
You've got different quests.

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:03.460
You have side quests.

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:10.420
You have different paths on a tree that you can unlock your skills.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:19.780
You also have your biotic powers, which are going to be more like telekinesis and shields

01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:22.100
and things like that, as long as tech powers as well.

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:35.060
And then there was also an app that you had that you could also contribute to your Galaxy

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:35.620
readiness.

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:36.100
Oh, my God.

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:37.060
I forgot about that.

01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:37.780
That was annoying.

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:42.980
And I brought up earlier about multiplayer.

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:47.460
So I'll get back to that in a moment, because I was saying that we played a lot of multiplayer.

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:50.340
I love multiplayer, but continue.

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:56.500
Yeah, but at any rate, so you've got different modes.

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.060
You have, like, action story and RPG.

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:02.980
So in action mode, your conversations are all just generic replies.

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:08.260
Story mode, you have manual replies and minimal combat.

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:12.100
RPG mode, you have manual replies and normal combat.

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:15.540
I always just played in story mode because that's why I was playing this for the story.

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:23.140
At any rate, the combat is actually pretty good.

01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:28.740
It's real time, but you can sort of have a pause to change your menu or move things around.

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:34.180
You are always playing as Commander Shepard, although Fem Ship is best ship.

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:38.980
And you can go into cover and play with different play styles.

01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:41.940
You can melee, you can use biotics, all of that.

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:44.900
Now multiplayer multiplayer was the best.

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:45.620
It was so good.

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:52.900
It was called Galaxy at War, and you could have up to four players to do Horde style

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:54.020
cooperative matches.

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:59.540
And you could also get in-game currency to unlock different items.

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:07.220
You know, I guess loot packs, you know, they did have the in-game transactions, but you

01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:08.180
didn't need them.

01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.020
It wasn't entirely reliant on them.

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:16.180
And then you could also do, for the first year, there were BioWare sponsored challenges

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.300
that had special objectives and increased rewards.

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:27.300
And so this isn't accurate because, oh, never mind, never mind.

01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:32.900
You can play as all kinds of different sorts of races instead of just playing as Shepard.

01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:38.420
You remember I had my Krogan named Rex in effect after the band?

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:42.660
Sorry, I was muted.

01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:43.160
Yeah.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:48.100
And then my Quarian engineer was who I pretty much played all the time.

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:53.460
But it was just really great.

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:56.020
And he had fantastic voice acting in it.

01:22:56.660 --> 01:23:01.700
You had, you know, Mark Mirren, Jennifer Hale, both amazing.

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.860
You had Kimberly Brooks's Ashley Williams.

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:07.300
I love listening to her voice.

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:12.580
And Freddie Prinze Jr. as Vega.

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.140
He was great.

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:18.580
I absolutely loved having him in there.

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:23.780
Of course, you had Seth Green as Joker, Martin Sheen as the Elusive Man.

01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:30.180
Aria was Carrie-Anne Moss, just, ugh, what a goddess.

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.820
You had Garrus, great voice.

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:39.700
But, I mean, they were just like such a good, oh, and Lance Henriksen as Admiral Hackett,

01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.820
like really just amazing voice actors.

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:50.340
So anyway, moving forward, as to the development of the game,

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:59.060
the co-lead writer for Mass Effect 2, Mac Walters, was lead writer for Mass Effect 3.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:06.580
And they just began a short story that went over the major plot points and then moved

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:07.620
high level for there.

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:12.660
And then, you know, they just sort of worked through it very organically from what I'm

01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:13.380
seeing on here.

01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:20.100
And then they had the different ending sequences that, with the Reapers, they had a lot more

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:21.060
than what we got.

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:30.820
In fact, there was an idea that would have had a Shepard who had been converted by Reaper

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:42.580
Shepard who had been converted by Reaper Tech, or that Saren would have, who was the first

01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:49.380
antagonist of the first Mass Effect, would have come back or something, or they would

01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:52.980
have actually were having Shepard mimic Saren's story.

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:56.180
The Elusive Man was supposed to be a boss.

01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:56.820
Did you know that?

01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.700
I remember hearing that, yeah.

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:01.380
Which always surprised me he wasn't.

01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:06.420
There's actually artwork of it, because I have it in one of the Mass Effect art books

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:11.380
that he was going to turn into this massive Reaper creature, but they scrapped that.

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:18.260
There is some dialogue I think is still in the code that was supposed to refer to that.

01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:26.260
They had other ones about dark energy, that the Entropic Effect would end the universe.

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:29.300
So they had other things like that.

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:36.020
And then in November 2011, a private beta of Mass Effect 3 was leaked onto Xbox Live.

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:43.060
And so there were plot points that people were able to access, and it made, it forced

01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:44.980
BioWare to change some of the story.

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:52.980
So it was originally designed for consoles that were heading to the end of their lifespans,

01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:58.980
and so they worked to optimize the gameplay rather than push the technology ahead.

01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:08.420
And then there were of course all the DLC that came out, but I'm going to actually take

01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:10.020
a step back and talk about the music.

01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:20.020
The music for Mass Effect 2 was a lot more orchestral, where for Mass Effect 3 is a lot

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:29.860
more synthesizer driven, and it ended up being the more likely choice for something

01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:33.540
where you're heading into this perhaps technological takeover.

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:42.020
And they did bring back fonts, I think, for the end song for that one, that did the end

01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:43.540
song at the first Mass Effect.

01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:45.780
This one's one of their, they're a prog rock band.

01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:55.540
But also moving forward, it was very heavily marketed, it was very, very looked forward

01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:55.700
to.

01:26:55.700 --> 01:27:00.900
They also used viral marketing with fictional blogs and a web series called BioWare Pulse.

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:07.860
There were early copies of Mass Effect 3 that were launched into space using weather balloons

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:13.860
and equipped with GPS devices, and fans could track them and recover them when they landed,

01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:15.620
which gave them early copies of the game.

01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:21.220
There were so many, there were just like that one leak that happened before.

01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:32.500
And it actually, this time they promoted the male and female Shepard because FemShep has

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.580
fans, and she was there first.

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:39.140
And then they did another one where you could decide what she looks like, and I'm sorry,

01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:41.380
I did not care for her face model.

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:43.300
It was not based on a human.

01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:47.220
But hacking's gonna hack.

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:52.660
There were mod editors that you could take that makeup look and apply it to a normal

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:54.900
shape of face and just do all kinds of different stuff for it.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:06.180
You also had different goodies for pre-orders, such as PSN ones were given the M55 Argus

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:09.220
assault weapon and a Mass Effect 3 PlayStation theme.

01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:14.740
The release was scheduled for late 2011, but it was moved to March 6, 2012.

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:19.380
It was only released for Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:26.100
But then as it came out, there was Mass Effect 3 also, by the way, required Origin to play

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:26.820
on PC.

01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:29.140
There's the Wii U version that came out.

01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:33.620
And then since then, we've had the remaster, which is Mass Effect Legendary Edition that

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:43.300
came for Windows, PS4, and Xbox One, of which I can only play two and three on my Windows

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:44.580
11 ARM partition.

01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:51.780
For some reason, it cannot emulate the architecture for Mass Effect 1 to run properly in it.

01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:55.940
So anyone who's on ARM-based machines, I'm going to warn you.

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:59.300
So there was DLC, and there was great DLC.

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:02.660
So the first one was okay.

01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.780
Oh, and by the way, by the way, let's rewind back.

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:06.740
Actually, we're not going to do it.

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:07.700
We're going to talk about it at the end.

01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:14.020
You had From Ashes, where you get Javik as a squad mate, and he was absolutely hilarious.

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:18.100
You had Leviathan that went into the Reaper's Origins.

01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:27.140
You had Omega, which was taking Omega back for Aria.

01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:31.460
And of course, that's the one that gave us our first female turian.

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:35.380
And then Citadel, which was...

01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:41.700
Citadel was like, hi, we've read your fan fiction, pretty much.

01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:49.460
I also liked, I don't know if you got this, but the place that the condo that Shepard

01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.380
was left was called Tiberius Towers.

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:56.660
And Tiberius was the middle name of Captain Kirk.

01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:57.160
Yep.

01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:03.220
There's also an interactive comic called Genesis 2 that you could play and customize

01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:07.700
for just quick setting up your story if you didn't have a game go through.

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:13.540
But Citadel was just, it was a trip.

01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:14.100
It was great.

01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:18.180
You know that you can actually still buy the, do you say, sushi plate set?

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:24.020
Do you say it was the restaurant where the Citadel thing starts going down?

01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:29.220
Anyway, let's talk about the response.

01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:33.620
So gameplay got a lot of praise.

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:36.420
It was decided to be really, really good.

01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:42.100
There were some bugs, but for the most part, the characters made up for the flaws.

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.820
The voice acting was top notch.

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:46.740
The music was great.

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:58.260
Everything overall that went into the game was pretty well received, except the endings.

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:09.300
So the endings for Mass Effect 3 was, no one liked it and by no one I mean most of the

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:10.100
internet.

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:15.700
And so there was an internet campaign called Retake Mass Effect to demand better ending

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:16.260
to the game.

01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:20.180
And part of that included a charity drive for Child's Play.

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:21.140
So some good from that.

01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:28.900
The public outcry basically even had responses from the Better Business Bureau and Federal

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:33.940
Trade Commission and the advertising standards authority to whether or not BioWare had engaged

01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:36.260
in false advertising and misled the customers.

01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:45.060
So on April 5th, 2012, BioWare announced a free DLC pack that would expand upon the ending

01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.500
and address the criticism.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:52.100
And it was called the Extended Cut that did come out on June 26, 2012.

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.300
And it was a mixed bag.

01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:58.020
Honestly, I'm fine with it.

01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:01.780
I love Extended Cut, but the original ending never bothered me so much.

01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:05.060
It wasn't great, but some movies have bad endings.

01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:07.220
I always thought this was way...

01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:08.820
That's why I can't stand the mist.

01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.100
Yeah, I always thought this...

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:11.540
It could have just kept it like the book.

01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:12.980
Blown way out of proportion.

01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:23.620
Well, there were other issues like the conflict of interest issue for having Jessica Chobot

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.380
as Diana Allers.

01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:26.740
Oh, yeah.

01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:32.100
And then some people were all like...

01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:38.820
They didn't like the same sex aspect to relationships for Shepard.

01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:43.700
And then they also didn't like that there were some characters who weren't available

01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:46.740
for that, because I mean, let's just face it, everyone wants to romance Garris.

01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:55.300
But at any rate, it originally shipped 3.5 million units in the first month.

01:32:55.300 --> 01:33:01.060
It sold 349,000 digital copies by the end of March alone.

01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:09.060
The game sold over 890,000 copies in its first 24 hours.

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:15.540
And according to MPD Group, it sold 1.3 million physical copies in the first month,

01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:20.580
which was twice the total of Mass Effect 2 during its opening month in January 2010.

01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:29.300
And in May 2012, EA reported that Mass Effect 3 grossed over 200 million during quarter 4 FY12.

01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:33.060
So that's financial year for people who don't know.

01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:37.140
And as far as accolades, it got a number of awards.

01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:42.180
The Satellite Award for Outstanding Role Playing Game, Best RPG at the Spike Video Game Awards,

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:47.620
Game of the Year from Game Informer, Best Overall RPG from IGN, Best Cooperative Multiplayer,

01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:50.420
Best Game Cinematography from Inside Gaming Awards.

01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:56.660
But basically, the legacy left by Mass Effect 3,

01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:01.780
it's really the one where we talk about entitled gamers.

01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:04.260
We don't like the end, change it.

01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:13.140
You know, and it also bringing in, you know, like when Andromeda came out,

01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:18.260
they actually had some very racy scenes in there and were not shy at all about

01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:21.940
romance options, you know, which I think is great.

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:24.900
I mean, Andromeda was questionable.

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:32.100
But in fact, moving into Andromeda, it was a sequel to the first trilogy,

01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:38.820
but it takes place 634 years later because of

01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:48.020
word cryology, the time it takes.

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.180
Cryogenic hibernation, that's what I'm thinking of.

01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:55.860
Or you play as either Sarah or Scott finding a new homeworld for humanity.

01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:06.180
And there's actually a Mass Effect universe game in development and pre-production at Bioware.

01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:08.980
So we're going to be getting something else.

01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:12.660
I just, I really, I really hope it's okay.

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:22.900
But as far as those scores, like the Xbox 360 and PS3 copies got a 93 of 100 for Metacritic,

01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:25.620
PC got 89, Wii U got 85.

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:30.740
But now I'm going to talk about another part of this, and that's the mods.

01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:35.940
My copy of Mass Effect 3 was modded to hell and back.

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:44.580
The high-res mod, beautiful, custom hair, awesome, fly cam, fly cam was my favorite.

01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:48.420
And I had, if anyone remembers this, because it's still there,

01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.940
I had a Tumblr account called Mass Effecting.

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:55.540
And it started with me making a stupid meme.

01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:57.940
I don't even remember.

01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:01.140
Oh yeah, it was a Vitturian with crossed eyes and it said Derpian.

01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:08.740
And from there that blog had over 10,000 followers by the time I had been running it for two years.

01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:13.780
I eventually gave up because I couldn't find any more, you know, good screenshots to use.

01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:21.780
But just showing, I mean, I basically created like a whole head Canon in that universe that

01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:28.100
people bought into, you know, but it just goes to show how big, you know, if my stupid Tumblr

01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:36.340
could get that many followers for weird memes, then the fanfiction world blew up.

01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:40.100
The fan merch world blew up, fan art blew up.

01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:46.740
I mean, now to the point where BioWare and the Yeti, I think is another one that sells

01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:52.020
some stuff, but like you can get official like Garris body pillows, you know, that type of thing.

01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:58.100
It's just, it's spawned such an amazing fandom that still thrives to this day.

01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:03.060
Maybe not as strong as it was, but it's still alive and kicking.

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:08.660
You know, those of us who romanced certain characters, anytime that character brings,

01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:14.820
is brought up, we're like, oh yeah, we're like that with Dragon Age as well, but I digress.

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:20.100
But yeah, it's Mass Effect 3.

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:24.660
It's probably one of my favorite modern games.

01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:27.540
I would probably say it is my favorite modern game.

01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:29.560
All right.

01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:32.340
Yeah, there you go.

01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:33.140
There it is.

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:36.340
Your classic game of the week, Mass Effect 3.

01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:40.660
I met so many friends through this game too, by the way.

01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:42.820
I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.

01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:46.740
I don't think the multiplayer got enough credit.

01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:51.460
You know, everybody bitched about the ending and so many people bitched about multiplayer too.

01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:55.380
And it's honestly one of the most enjoyable multiplayer experiences I've had in a game

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.500
where like literally a lot of my friends are playing it.

01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.780
We did good things in it.

01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:01.460
It impacted your single player game.

01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:03.220
I just, it was so good.

01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:08.340
Like I, I wish they had done a standalone multiplayer game and still kind of wish they

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:12.100
would just sort of bridge the gap between releases.

01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:14.740
Andromeda's multiplayer was even okay.

01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:15.860
It was different.

01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:18.580
I mean, but it was, it was okay.

01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:19.780
You know what I mean?

01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:20.980
Like, I don't know what else to say.

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:21.480
It was okay.

01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:26.100
But I still wish there would be something to kind of like hold us over.

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:26.500
I don't know.

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:27.780
I miss it.

01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:31.060
Well, I'm glad they fixed a few things with Andromeda.

01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:32.740
I didn't think it was a bad game at all.

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.660
I honestly enjoyed it.

01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:40.020
But, um, but I, and there's people who think that Mass Effect 2 is the pinnacle of the

01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:44.820
series, but honestly, I got a lot more out of the story for Mass Effect 3.

01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:51.540
I thought that there was, especially for those of us who, you know, romanced Garrus, there

01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:56.420
was a lot more payoff in it than just a head bump, you know?

01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:04.420
But, but I'm actually looking at my mass affecting Tumblr and I forgot that I made

01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:05.780
some of these ridiculous things.

01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:08.100
All right.

01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:13.300
You got 10,000 followers on your Tumblr, but this podcast can seem to only get 10 listeners.

01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:18.020
Pint out our podcast on my Tumblr.

01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:18.520
I know.

01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:19.800
You know?

01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:20.840
All right.

01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:22.200
Anyway.

01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:23.700
All right.

01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:24.420
Well, there it is.

01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:27.300
Now Dark Soccer has done the entire trilogy.

01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:29.300
She can't pick a Mass Effect game ever again.

01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.140
Well, when Andromeda is 10 years old, I guess.

01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:32.900
When Andromeda is 10 years old, I sure can.

01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:36.100
Uh, all right.

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:36.820
Let's miss you.

01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:38.180
Wait, let's move on.

01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:39.140
I guess I will.

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:43.140
So I'll see you in 2026 or whatever that game turns 10.

01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:43.640
All right.

01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:45.140
Will you still be doing this?

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:46.580
Who knows?

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:47.080
All right.

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:52.900
I mean, I'm pretty sure around episode nine, I was saying, can you imagine, or like we

01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:54.900
were doing the first year, even a hundred episodes.

01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:58.580
I was like, can you imagine if we were still doing this at a thousand episodes?

01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:01.460
And now it's like, wow, that might actually happen.

01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:01.940
All right.

01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:08.820
Anyway, I'm putting it in the chat, but everyone needs to look at this because this is my favorite

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:11.380
one I've made for this little memes.

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:11.620
All right.

01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:13.140
Well, we need to do rapid fire news.

01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:14.100
So you keep the show moving.

01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:15.220
Let's get to it.

01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:19.860
Rapid fire news and some other stories, uh, around the gaming industry.

01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:20.980
So Loki, we'll start with you.

01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:23.140
Yeah, I'm pretty excited.

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:27.380
There's a brand new Lego game coming out called Lego brick tales.

01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:32.260
And it's a little bit different than your typical Lego game by like traveler tales or

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:32.760
something like that.

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:39.380
Um, so this one is a physics based puzzle game.

01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:45.860
So it kind of reminds me a little bit of besieged, or I guess a little bit like Kerbell's

01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:52.980
space program where you have to build different devices out of Lego and they react to the

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:53.220
physics.

01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:56.820
So like they have like, you know, a helicopter that you build or something like that, and

01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:58.260
you have to solve puzzles with it.

01:40:58.260 --> 01:40:59.620
So that sounds pretty cool.

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:02.740
And that's supposed to be releasing sometime this year.

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:04.980
So we'll have to look forward to that.

01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:13.540
And then, uh, there is a silly game coming out by the folks that did the, uh, bloodborne

01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:16.340
demake like for PlayStation one.

01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:20.580
Now they're taking those models that they made for the demake and they're making bloodborne

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:22.580
cart, a goat cart game.

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:26.980
So I guess we'll have to wait and see with it.

01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:27.780
Cause it's funny.

01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:29.860
Yeah, no, I think it's funny too.

01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:33.940
I wonder if it'll be as punishing of a cart game as those.

01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:39.940
That would be funny if it was like a, like the ultimately punishing difficult like cart

01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:40.260
game.

01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:42.900
Uh, I would, I would think that was funny.

01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:46.020
I probably wouldn't play it very long, but I think it was funny for the five minutes

01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:46.500
I play it.

01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:47.460
So, yeah.

01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:48.340
All right.

01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:49.700
Um, let's see.

01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:50.580
How about dark Sakura?

01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:54.500
I had to unmute.

01:41:54.500 --> 01:42:02.260
So there is, there are, you know, uh, NFT games out there and basically all they are

01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:10.980
is just to sell the NFTs, you know, but someone's actually making a game called alluvium that

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:18.180
is supposed to be pretty much up there with, with any good game, um, where you can earn

01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:19.780
your NFTs in game.

01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:25.220
Um, or you can purchase them or do exchanges with other people, but the fact that you can

01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:30.900
get them in game makes it a little bit less cringey.

01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:40.580
Um, but at any rate, um, the, uh, it's, it's the, the currency for it though is based on

01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:49.220
Ethereum, but at any rate, uh, the game is where you have different robot helpers that

01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:54.260
go with you and you have to explore the planet and you meet different creatures that you

01:42:54.260 --> 01:43:00.260
battle with and your little robot friends, you know, are kind of your, your battler.

01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:03.620
You also have to look at the synergy with your armor and all this other stuff.

01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:07.620
And it actually looks like it's fairly complicated, uh, gameplay.

01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:15.380
Um, but you can buy the, the native token with, uh, Binance, Qcoin, Poloniex, Gate.io,

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:24.020
other exchanges, um, for people who are into crypto and, and NFTs, I guess this would be

01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:26.740
a good RPG.

01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:29.220
And actually I've watched the, the trailer for it.

01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:30.900
It actually kind of looks fun.

01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:35.460
Um, they're focusing on marketing and promotion right now.

01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:43.220
It's just that I hope that this doesn't set a, a trend for other games to come out like

01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:47.380
it and to encourage these other companies to start dealing in NFT.

01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:48.180
Oh, well too late.

01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:53.940
They're everybody's I mean, I know I totally do, but I already, everybody's asking how

01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:54.980
can we cash in on this?

01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:55.700
I'm sorry.

01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:59.140
Until NFTs don't feel like I'm participating in crime.

01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:02.260
Um, I, I'm not interested in them.

01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:07.460
Like I, I'm just, I just, I just, I'm sick of it being shoved into my face.

01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:11.460
Like I need to accept these NFTs and, and this is where it's going.

01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:16.100
Cause all the cool kids say it's going to FTS like prove it.

01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:18.740
Like if it's that valuable, it'll stand out on its own.

01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:22.900
But it's like you even whisper the letters NFT on Twitter and you're going to have bought

01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:27.300
accounts up your asshole trying to sell things that like you just have no interest in.

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:31.060
And let's also talk about how ugly most of the NFTs that are available are.

01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:33.940
Like a lot of those procedurally generated things and stuff.

01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:34.820
It's stupid.

01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:40.820
Now I will go out on a limb and say this one actually looks pretty good.

01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:41.060
Yeah.

01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:47.620
Now if a good game comes out, because again, a good game is a good game and it manages

01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:52.500
to leverage NFTs in a way where again, it doesn't feel like I'm participating in crime.

01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:55.860
I'll have a more open mind about it, but.

01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:59.220
And this one, by the way, is running in Unreal five.

01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:00.680
Interesting.

01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:02.420
Yeah.

01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:03.540
It's interesting.

01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:04.580
I mean, that's it.

01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:13.140
It's if, if this is a way that NFT actually is going to work in a.

01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:19.300
I want to say ethical way.

01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:20.980
No, I get it.

01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:21.460
I get it.

01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:28.980
Then I'm okay with something like this, especially if the fact that you can have a chance to

01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:34.740
get the more valuable items in game and then trade around and move them up.

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:37.220
You know, for me, that's like playing, you know, playing magic.

01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:38.440
Yeah.

01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:43.620
You know, you would get your rare cards out of your, out of your packs and then trade

01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:45.060
them around to your friends.

01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:46.180
And I mean, that's.

01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:51.460
Without, you know, all of the crypto aspect of it, that's essentially what NFTs are.

01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:55.700
Um, a set in chat says the MLM of investing.

01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:59.220
I, I, yeah, that's what NFTs certainly feel like.

01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:03.700
But when, you know, speaking of MLMs, I'll still buy Tupperware at target.

01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:09.220
So if there's a way to buy old Tupperware, if there's a, yeah, or old Tupperware at a

01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:18.100
thrift store, if there's a way to make it feel less slimy and unnecessary, then I think

01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:22.420
that's finally how people will crack the code on making the masses accept NFTs.

01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:25.300
Cause right now it feels like, it feels like a crime family.

01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:25.940
It really does.

01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:28.260
So we'll see.

01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:39.300
Uh, the other news, um, the Mario 64 guidebook scans were required to be taken down.

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:46.100
Um, they were, were all online with different 3d models for each of the levels and everything.

01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:52.220
And, uh, they were required, uh, the uploader who's Dave, uh,

01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:55.540
shoveling of comfort food, video games to, to take down.

01:46:56.260 --> 01:47:01.140
And they challenged copyright and said, we don't, we don't want it anymore.

01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:03.780
So they have to acquiesce.

01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:09.620
I mean, they're really, really just tapping down on it and it's disgusting.

01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:09.860
Yeah.

01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:11.860
I mean, like I understand.

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:20.660
Piracy of scanned books is a crappy thing, but Mario essentials got taken down.

01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:21.620
Yeah.

01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:23.860
Mario 64 is also how old of a game.

01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:27.860
And there comes a certain point where again, I think it's about preserving certain types

01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:28.900
of media.

01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:33.940
It's not like you can walk into a library and find a copy of this strategy guide or

01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:38.740
find it through any sort of legitimate, at least first party means you might luck into

01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:43.300
one at a garage sale, but how often is that or use bookstore, but how often is that going

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:44.100
to happen?

01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:49.300
So I feel like these scans were a way to kind of preserve something that really wasn't,

01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:51.860
let's it wasn't making Nintendo money.

01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:55.940
And I, I, I'm sure there'll be people that are like, well, Nintendo has to defend their

01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:56.420
trademarks.

01:47:56.420 --> 01:48:01.300
So there's a certain line.

01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:05.060
Nintendo keeps crossing that nobody else in the game industry feels like they need to

01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:05.380
cross.

01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:10.580
There, there should be a statute of limitations that applies to that.

01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:12.580
Like, like with music or, or something.

01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:16.020
Or even the hardware.

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:20.260
Cause you know, Nintendo hardware, third parties just make straight up Nintendo systems and

01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:26.340
now super Nintendo systems, they can't be stopped because those trademarks do expire

01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:28.260
after 30 years or something like that.

01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:32.500
So that's why you have all of a sudden, all these other, like the retron five and stuff

01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:39.220
that literally just play the carts because the, the ability for Nintendo to have the

01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:43.220
market on that runs out after so many years, which is interesting.

01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:51.620
Anyway, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and we'll start

01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:52.900
with the U S and Loki.

01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:54.260
Yep.

01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:56.340
Not a whole lot coming out over here.

01:48:56.340 --> 01:49:00.580
We've got Crusader Kings three on PlayStation five and Xbox series.

01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:08.020
Uh, Chris star on Tendo switch, death stranding director's cut on PC.

01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:17.860
Moss book two on PlayStation four and the weird West on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox

01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:18.180
one.

01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:24.420
Looking at Japan, uh, we have a few releases on the Nintendo switch this week.

01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:30.980
We have Barry Shauna, uh, Senza, Ishigu no Kaze in a regular and limited edition.

01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:33.620
There's also a twin pack coming out for all that.

01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:39.700
A game called kiss trilogy is coming out as well, uh, which is includes the games hotch

01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:42.340
kiss, kiss bell and kiss auto.

01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:49.460
Um, they look like dating Sims and it's, um, women of a questionable age in swimsuits on

01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:50.660
the cover hand drawn.

01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:52.100
So it's, it's that kind of game.

01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:58.660
Uh, we also have in Japan on the switch, uh, Hokago Cinderella is out in a regular and

01:49:58.660 --> 01:49:59.940
a limited edition.

01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:07.060
And, uh, that's it for the switch, but looking at the PlayStation five, uh, it's a dry week.

01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:09.460
We don't have a release there until the 1st of April.

01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:12.020
So, uh, no way, which I guess is this week, isn't it?

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:15.060
So I will mention, uh, what was it?

01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:15.540
There it is.

01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:18.580
MLB the show is out in Japan this week.

01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:21.860
It's out in English, but, uh, it is still getting a regional release in Japan.

01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:23.380
Very popular over there.

01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:25.940
It sure is a dark soccer.

01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:26.500
How about Europe?

01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:34.580
So on the 29th, we have in nightmare for a PlayStation crusader Kings three for PlayStation

01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:41.220
and X-Box on the 31st, we have grand mountain venture wonderlands for switch.

01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:46.820
And then for PlayStation and X-Box, we have Tropico six, uh, next gen edition from it

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:47.220
looks like.

01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:50.420
And then on April 1st, we have doki doki literature club.

01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:57.940
Plus, all right, well, let's do some more news stories and then we'll get to emails

01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:02.260
any calls that might want to come in tonight and all that other good stuff in our round

01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:02.740
table.

01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:04.900
But first, a few more headlines starting with Loki.

01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:06.580
Yeah.

01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:14.740
So rockstar has decided to go ahead and offer a subscription service now to grand theft

01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:17.620
auto online called GTA plus.

01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:26.180
It is going to cost $6 a month and they give you in game money as well as some other perks

01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:31.780
along with that, mostly in game items and like properties and stuff like that.

01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:35.300
But this is coming right after that.

01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:43.060
They've decided to, um, basically sell the upgrade for grand theft auto five, um, and

01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:45.700
online they're offering it now for like 40 bucks right now.

01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:49.380
Grand theft auto online is actually free on PlayStation, I believe.

01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:52.900
Um, but they're going to charge for that later on as well.

01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:57.860
And it's just, it's, it's just another cash grab.

01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:00.180
It's like subscribing to their shark cards.

01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:06.500
And I think it's just terrible, but yeah, I saw, I saw your tweet tweet about it.

01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:10.020
Like you definitely have some strong opinions, but I know it's just like, well, it's just

01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:11.860
like, I just kind of given up on it.

01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:13.780
It's like, what, what, what happened to you guys?

01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:18.660
Like, seriously, like you used to be a company and make fun of companies like this, and now

01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:21.380
you're just, just milking it.

01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:23.300
Like this game is so old now.

01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:27.700
We're almost classic game of the week time on this game because it's been out for so

01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:27.940
long.

01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:32.340
It's just like, I just don't understand.

01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:35.380
I mean, I understand cause they're making tons of money off of it.

01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:39.860
So, but it sounds like that they're just trying to get people hooked on this kind of

01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:40.180
stuff.

01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:47.380
And mind you that the reason why that $500,000 delivered to you each month, isn't a ton of

01:52:47.380 --> 01:52:47.700
money.

01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:49.460
It's because of them.

01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:52.900
They've designed the game this way to make it incredibly grindy.

01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:56.900
And I remember when I first started playing Grand Theft Auto online, it was grindy, but

01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:59.380
it wasn't like super grindy.

01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:01.300
Like now it's just ridiculous.

01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:04.580
The amount of stuff that you have to pay for in that's all by design.

01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:07.300
It's all by design, the milk, those microtransactions.

01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:08.340
And that's what they do.

01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:13.380
And that's how they're making billions of dollars off of this game from just the microtransactions

01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:16.660
because you have to pay the upkeep your car.

01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:20.740
You have to pay insurance on your car to pay rent for your apartment and stuff.

01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:21.540
Yeah, I get it.

01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:26.100
It's like real life, but I don't play Grand Theft Auto to experience real life.

01:53:26.100 --> 01:53:28.980
Like, I don't understand.

01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:30.020
Where's my cheat code?

01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:30.820
Where's my cheat code?

01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:37.460
It is on purpose because they make money off of this and now they're charging more money

01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:40.100
for it because they're going to make money off of this.

01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:42.740
It's just it's very blatant.

01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:44.340
Like how cash grabby this is.

01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:48.660
Well, mind you also, like I would say you're doing you're doing the right thing in voicing

01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:50.820
your opposition by not playing.

01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:52.660
You're not sitting there playing the game going.

01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:53.140
I hate it.

01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:53.540
I hate it.

01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:54.020
I hate it.

01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:54.900
You're just not playing.

01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:56.420
Exactly.

01:53:56.420 --> 01:54:00.900
Like if I was supposed to purchase the game, it would be on PC and it would be just to

01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:03.380
play the single player and mess with mods.

01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:04.100
And that's it.

01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:05.940
I wouldn't be playing Grand Theft Auto online.

01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:07.540
I have no interest in it.

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:11.060
And I understand that they're adding new content to Grand Theft Auto online.

01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:15.300
But yeah, they should be if they're making a billion dollars off of that.

01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:19.620
That that's that's like another Grand Theft Auto five every year.

01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:24.740
Like, yes, they should be putting money into that if that's how much money they're making

01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:25.140
out of it.

01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:28.100
I mean, that's only fair, though.

01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:32.740
And even I think what they're putting into it is not exactly what they're getting out

01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:32.980
of it.

01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:36.660
I think they're putting in far less versus what they're getting out.

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:42.580
So you do you, I guess, rock star, but like, I'm just not supporting it.

01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:44.500
All right.

01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:47.860
Well, moving on, we have another story from Dark Sakura.

01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:50.760
We do.

01:54:52.260 --> 01:55:02.660
So this is another sad outcome from the utter, utterly ridiculous actions taken by Russia

01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:03.460
against Ukraine.

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:12.500
There is a video game history center in Ukraine is called the Mariupol Computer Museum.

01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:20.660
It was destroyed earlier this week by a Russian bomb at over 120 retro computers and consoles,

01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:25.780
as well as over 500 exhibits were destroyed.

01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:34.820
It was owned by Dimitri Cherapanov, and he wanted to use it to highlight the retro.

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.580
Let me actually rewind back.

01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:44.660
He wanted to make it just to show the history of retro computing consoles technology, anything

01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:50.340
from the 1950s up to the early 2000s, a collection that took him over 20 years to make.

01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:55.540
And it's absolutely disgusting.

01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:04.100
Cherapanov is accepting donations to help rebuild the computer museum, at least in digital form.

01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:05.380
He's got a website out.

01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:09.220
I'll see if I can link it in chat.

01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:17.460
But it's just, it's one part of this absolutely disgusting event.

01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:24.340
And I'm just so irritated by it.

01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:28.260
Irritated is a light word, but I'm completely off.

01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:35.140
I mean, it's disgusting that Putin's army attacks museums, libraries, theaters.

01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:37.940
And the thing is, it wasn't a target.

01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:40.340
It was there.

01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:42.180
Oh, but still.

01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:44.900
Why would they target a video game museum?

01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:45.620
They wouldn't do that.

01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:49.300
When they bomb, they bomb city centers.

01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:55.300
They bomb places that, you know, that are in general going to make strategic sense.

01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:56.740
It wasn't targeted for it.

01:56:57.620 --> 01:57:09.220
But the fact that it was a casualty of this callous, unnecessary behavior is absolutely

01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:09.780
disgusting.

01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:15.220
Well, I mean, just the fact they're targeting the places where people live and are in the

01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:20.180
first place when it was always, you know, the line that Putin is about military and

01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:22.900
all this stuff is like very clearly, that's not what's happening.

01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:27.060
You know, it's yet another one of those, you know, many lies that comes out of his mouth.

01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:29.300
So it's just, well, you know, he's friends with.

01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:30.340
Yeah, I know.

01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:30.900
It's just.

01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:37.140
Yeah, anyway, Biden just said what we were all thinking.

01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:38.820
That's all I'm going to say.

01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:41.540
All right, moving on.

01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:44.900
He said the quiet part out loud, which a president isn't supposed to do.

01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:45.860
That's all.

01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:46.340
All right.

01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:48.020
Honestly, presidents should.

01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:50.340
Sometimes.

01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:50.840
Yes.

01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:52.260
All right.

01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:53.780
Moving on, Loki.

01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:59.540
Then they also started DDoSing Among Us.

01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:00.820
When's it going to stop?

01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:05.380
But apparently it's been a lot of different services being DDoSed recently.

01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:12.340
And the North American European servers are getting DDoSed right now for Among Us.

01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:18.580
So it's hard for folks to log in or even play at all because of what's going on.

01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:19.720
But.

01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:24.180
Yeah, there's, you know, of course, they're working.

01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:28.260
Airsloth is still working on fixing the server problems, but they don't have any sort of

01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:33.220
update or what on when that's going to be resolved.

01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:34.580
That sucks.

01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:41.460
Yeah, why would you attack like a small indie game like this anyway?

01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:47.380
I mean, I guess I know I was like the answers right themselves.

01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:49.300
Like, of course, I should know better.

01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:50.740
But it's just it's sad.

01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:53.780
You know, it doesn't I don't know.

01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:56.020
It's silly.

01:58:56.820 --> 01:58:58.980
Anyway, I have one more.

01:58:58.980 --> 01:58:59.700
I hate people.

01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:00.340
I know, right?

01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:02.260
I have one more story for tonight.

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:07.620
And it's about it's about a genre that we've started talking a lot more about ever since

01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:10.260
Star Soccer and I got into Dead by Daylight.

01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:15.220
And that is the 4v1 genre, which, of course, yes, DBD wasn't the first.

01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:17.540
We had evolved asymmetrical horror.

01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:25.060
Well, OK, I guess this would fall under asymmetrical horror, but a new game was now asymmetrical

01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:29.620
horror because I experienced far more horror than I'm sure that the developers did.

01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:30.020
All right.

01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:31.060
Well, I got to hear about this.

01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:35.380
So this is the announcement for Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed.

01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:38.820
It is an asymmetrical multiplayer game.

01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:43.060
I guess, you know, I don't think Ghostbusters was ever really scary, but, you know, I would

01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:48.900
say some some horror falls in that Vincent Price and Elvira category where it's not scary.

01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:49.860
It's just dark.

01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:57.860
So Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed is being created by Friday the 13th Red Flag and predator

01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:00.260
hunting grounds developer Il Fonic.

02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:04.340
Actually, I like the Friday the 13th game when it first came out before it hit all those

02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:05.220
legal issues.

02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:05.940
So I don't know.

02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:06.440
We'll see.

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:12.420
In Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed, you put on a proton pack, grab a ghost trap and monitor

02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:18.340
the PKE meter as a ghostbuster in a team of four brave souls pursuing ghastly ghosts,

02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:20.260
terrorizing public locations.

02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:26.020
So, of course, if you are a ghostbuster, you want to find the ghost, blast them with stream,

02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:28.260
get them in place and then shut the trap.

02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:34.660
The ghost, on the other hand, get to fly, teleport between rifts, possess objects and

02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:37.860
use slime and summoning ghoulish minions to win the day.

02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:42.740
So Dark Sakura, did you check out the trailer?

02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:43.380
Do you have thoughts?

02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:47.860
I don't have any thoughts right now.

02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:53.620
I have so many other things I have to play right now that I don't have time to think

02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:54.420
of playing anything else.

02:00:55.620 --> 02:01:01.060
I should point out that Ernie Hudson, who plays Winston Zetimore and Dan Aykroyd, who

02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:03.620
play Ray Stantz, will be voices in the game.

02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:04.900
So there is a little bit of a tie.

02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:05.780
Okay, then I'm playing it.

02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:09.700
Loki, what were your thoughts?

02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:10.580
It looks dumb.

02:01:10.580 --> 02:01:11.620
It really looks dumb.

02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:16.820
Like, honestly, like they had a really good single player Ghostbusters game not that long

02:01:16.820 --> 02:01:21.780
ago that was essentially with all the original cast from the Ghostbusters in there.

02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:25.140
It's supposed to be a semi-official sequel.

02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:28.120
Yeah.

02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:30.020
Yeah, that one is.

02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:33.620
And this one is just it just looks like a cash grab.

02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:36.020
Honestly, like, it just doesn't.

02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:38.340
I don't see this doing well.

02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:41.300
It just didn't look interesting.

02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:45.860
And funny enough, actually, this whole idea of, like, ghosts versus, like, ghost hunters

02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:46.660
type of thing.

02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:51.700
They have an indie game that's basically this already that was in development and looked

02:01:51.700 --> 02:01:52.820
much better.

02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:55.300
Like, are you talking about I see people play that on Twitch.

02:01:55.300 --> 02:01:56.740
Are you talking about Phasmophobia?

02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:58.820
No, it's not Phasmophobia.

02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:06.020
It was an asymmetrical game because Phasmophobia is basically you against computer where I

02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:12.020
don't remember what it was called, but it was a multiplayer like ghost hunting game

02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:20.340
and it was an indie game that came or I don't even know if it's out yet, but I know there's

02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:21.780
Phasma, but it's not Phasma.

02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:26.900
OK, well, there's and the 4v1 again, I don't know if that's just dead by daylight success,

02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:30.020
especially when it comes to Twitch and those sorts of environments or what.

02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:33.780
But we're seeing a lot of these and I'm not even just talking about like VHS, but now

02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:38.500
there's like an official Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre that's coming out.

02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:39.060
That's like this.

02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:43.860
I mean, it seems like this is a genre that more people are trying to get into.

02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:48.900
And, you know, again, some are going to flop, but some might do OK.

02:02:48.900 --> 02:02:49.460
We'll see.

02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:52.580
VHS is actually should be coming back online soon.

02:02:53.140 --> 02:02:54.020
Yeah, it might be.

02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:56.260
I think it's this one, Midnight Ghost Hunt.

02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:59.060
It's actually an early access starting March 31st.

02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:00.820
Oh, and it's essentially like.

02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:06.340
It looks exactly like the ghost was saying, except this looks better, actually.

02:03:08.020 --> 02:03:12.020
Well, I mean, indie games have a lot of good stuff.

02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:13.780
That's where your Minecraft came from.

02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:15.940
That's where Among Us came from.

02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:19.300
You know, the next big thing is oftentimes driven by an indie.

02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:23.540
So, yeah, I would say Midnight Ghost Hunt looks way better than Ghostbusters.

02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.700
Ghostbusters looks cheap.

02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:27.700
And that's sad because I like Ghostbusters.

02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:29.220
All right.

02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:34.900
We're going to get to our listener roundtable where we get inspiration from all of you.

02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:37.460
So we get we get our mailbag.

02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:41.220
We might do some calls tonight if you want to join our green room on Discord.

02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:47.060
And we also get to your questions in our Twitch chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:52.100
We'll head first to the mailbag at participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:55.780
If you want to send us an email for a future week, let's get to it.

02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:57.140
I think we have at least one email tonight.

02:03:57.140 --> 02:03:57.780
Dark Soccer.

02:03:57.780 --> 02:03:58.340
We have one.

02:03:58.900 --> 02:03:59.700
Uno.

02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:00.900
Hi. Are you ready?

02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:03.620
Hi again, OLR crew.

02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:04.900
It's been a long time.

02:04:04.900 --> 02:04:07.380
When I started working remote during the pandemic,

02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:10.340
I didn't have my commute time to listen to podcasts anymore.

02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:13.140
Well, a few weeks ago, I had to start coming into the office again.

02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:15.380
So I'm back to listening to OLR as well.

02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:18.820
The show still sounds great, even though you aren't in the same room anymore.

02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:25.860
Anyway, just writing because one of my big interests is movies and specifically the Oscars

02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:27.380
since the ceremony is coming up.

02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:32.740
And a couple of weeks ago, you're all talking about theories on how the statues are handed out.

02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:37.220
All of the winners receive their actual Oscar statues when they accept the award.

02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:40.020
They carry that same statue around all night.

02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:44.500
And after the ceremony, the winners go to the Governor's Ball,

02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:50.660
where there is an area where a personalized engraved plaque is affixed while they wait.

02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:51.940
That's pretty much it.

02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:55.460
Sorry I don't have much to say about video games right now,

02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:58.420
though I am excited for the Rift Tracks video game.

02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:04.580
It sounds like they are taking a page out of the Jackbox Playbook, and I can't wait to play it.

02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:06.660
Keep up the great show, Flaco Jones.

02:05:06.660 --> 02:05:07.860
That game looks awesome.

02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:10.660
Yeah, strong agree on the Rift Tracks.

02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:13.380
So always great to hear from Flaco Jones.

02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:18.020
I didn't even think about the fact that people kind of losing their commutes for a long time

02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:20.500
kind of cut into the listenership of the show.

02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:24.420
I just thought, I don't know, this show was getting worse and people were finding better shows.

02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:25.780
No, I'm kidding.

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:32.580
I had a lot of that going on with me listening to that one podcast.

02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:35.940
I'm super fond of Stuff Mom Never Told You.

02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:36.440
Mm hmm.

02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:41.220
And and I mean, it's.

02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:44.580
The easiest time is when you're on the road.

02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:52.100
It's I run it Flaco Jones, I think, meant this email for last week and we won't talk about last

02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:56.260
week, but I think it's interesting because now he's talking about the Oscars, which happened to

02:05:56.260 --> 02:05:59.060
be, you know, I'm not oblivious to what's going on in the real world.

02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:00.100
I know that's going on right now.

02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:01.140
You have to go to a birthday party.

02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:08.980
Yeah, well, while while this is going on, but I now that that was I'm like, I have heard

02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:09.700
this before.

02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:14.180
I've heard about the fact that there's like an official party with an engraving station

02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:15.140
and all this stuff.

02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:16.740
I have heard that before.

02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:18.500
So thanks for reminding me.

02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:20.820
I could I couldn't think about it in the moment.

02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:23.860
But now you have me thinking about the Rift Tracks game and you have our chat thinking

02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:28.820
about it as well as to what Matt says, I'd be down for a Rift Tracks night has Twitch

02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:29.700
integration.

02:06:29.700 --> 02:06:30.660
Yeah, sounds like fun.

02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:32.660
I'd be down for that, that's for sure.

02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:37.860
All right, I think we have a caller that wants to come on.

02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:40.340
So I am going to try to make that happen.

02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:42.260
We'll see how successful it is.

02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:46.500
But I am going to go and bring this person on and say hello.

02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:48.420
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:48.920
Who's this?

02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:53.140
You didn't think my hot take was going to be limited to 15 seconds tonight.

02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:54.340
Of course not.

02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:55.380
How's it going?

02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:56.260
It's good to hear from you.

02:06:57.140 --> 02:07:02.500
Uh, open ended question that leads into the point that I kind of wanted to make.

02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:03.000
All right.

02:07:03.700 --> 02:07:13.940
What are each of your first biggest thoughts on why scummy loot boxes, transactions, etc.

02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:15.540
are all such a thing these days?

02:07:16.420 --> 02:07:19.700
Because they work very well one time.

02:07:20.740 --> 02:07:23.220
And for example, Overwatch.

02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:27.700
Overwatch did the loot box thing, and it did it successfully.

02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:31.940
I think other games did it too that are not in my wheelhouse, like Call of Duty or something

02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:32.340
like that.

02:07:32.900 --> 02:07:34.500
Oh, it's just no sports game.

02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:36.340
Well, okay, Mass Effect 3.

02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:41.540
And that, but or as, and Loki did make this point earlier in the show.

02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:46.660
A free game does it first as a way to monetize the game.

02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:49.460
And then it's extremely successful.

02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:54.900
And then somebody decides, well, why can't we do that on top of the $60 game?

02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:58.660
And then you get that Star Wars game from a couple of years ago with Pink Darth Vader.

02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:00.580
A battlefield.

02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:01.140
Yeah.

02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:01.700
Battlefront.

02:08:01.700 --> 02:08:02.260
Battlefront.

02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:03.060
Battlefront.

02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:03.560
Battlefront.

02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:05.060
Yeah.

02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:07.540
EA EA battle game.

02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:07.940
Right.

02:08:07.940 --> 02:08:09.940
License character three.

02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:10.580
Exactly.

02:08:12.100 --> 02:08:15.300
So yeah, that's my thought.

02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:18.100
So okay, you started with the question, but.

02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:24.740
I, the, the rest of the, the rest of the point that I have is a little bit of a ramble and

02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:28.580
it's a really conflicting thought because of my own punditry and whatnot as well.

02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:32.980
Back in, oh geez, what year would this have been?

02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:34.500
2015.

02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:40.820
I was, I was a lot more into the tech punditry world than I am, than I have been in many

02:08:40.820 --> 02:08:41.380
years now.

02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:45.140
I don't know if any of you know the name MG Siegler.

02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:51.060
Um, big wig investor, been on a bunch of podcasts, uh, guests of podcasts.

02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:56.340
He's a, he's a big name in the punditry world and he's aligned with, uh, Oh geez.

02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:56.980
I actually don't know.

02:08:56.980 --> 02:09:01.300
I think he, I think he stepped up to Google ventures from, from lesser ones and that kind

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:02.020
of stuff.

02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:07.940
At any rate, like I have not to, not to go all in on just all, all, you know, all management

02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:10.020
is evil, but that's certainly kind of a thing.

02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:15.060
Just that the business management thing really ticks me off in the artistic sphere.

02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:16.180
It's not far off.

02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:16.900
Let's be real.

02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:19.700
MG Siegler.

02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:26.340
I, I, I always disagreed with him a little bit and he was a lot more brash than I typically

02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:29.700
like personalities to be personalities that I actually pay attention to.

02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:34.580
But the one thing that really got under my skin was that, uh, there was this one article

02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:40.420
that he was talking about, uh, Nintendo products should not be controlled by Nintendo.

02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:43.860
Nintendo should not make decisions about Nintendo.

02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:46.660
That's just the whole, why isn't Mario on PS5?

02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:50.420
That's, that's, that is that exact same argument in another dress.

02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:56.580
And remember, remember the year, the context in particular was we, you, uh, and I, I know

02:09:56.580 --> 02:10:01.060
I've said on this show multiple times that like, you know, the, the SNES was good.

02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:07.380
The N64 was difficult and weird, but probably okay because of the generational, you know,

02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:13.380
the 3d, the great 3d transition kind of mitigated the roughness that the Nintendo 64 had.

02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:19.860
The GameCube, I actually kind of put in cult classic territory where it was damn good and

02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:23.780
had amazing games, but it certainly fell behind.

02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:26.260
It was certainly, you know, number three amongst the big three.

02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:28.900
But it had amazing titles.

02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:36.020
And I've said numerous times about how the Wii was a gigantic breakout because of Wii Sports.

02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:38.820
And the rest of it's normal.

02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:42.260
It's normal, you know, gamer base, the people that enjoy these kinds of things.

02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:47.940
The Wii U, Nintendo, you know, tried to do what they thought was a success and it was,

02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:51.700
yeah, it was problematic for every reason that it was.

02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:56.900
Well, you know, I'm going to bring this up because, you know, this is the hill I will

02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:58.740
die on when it comes to the Wii U.

02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:01.780
I'm going to point me to the hill and I will go die on it.

02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:05.380
This is not going to surprise you or anyone that's listened to this show for any amount

02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:05.780
of time.

02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:12.100
The Wii U would have had an entirely different trajectory if they'd given it a better name.

02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:17.220
I agree with that.

02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:23.220
The minute, just the last thought, the minute they showed up on the Tonight Show and the

02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:25.220
guy, was it Fallon or Leno?

02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:25.700
I don't know at the time.

02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:26.500
I think it was Fallon.

02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:29.380
Fallon at the time goes, so this is an expansion for the Wii?

02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:32.260
No, this is a new thing.

02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:34.420
That was the moment that system was fucked.

02:11:35.380 --> 02:11:39.300
And that should have been the way the tea leaves said this system is fucked.

02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:44.580
If Jimmy Fallon didn't understand that, how is Soccer Mom USA shopping at Walmart going

02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:45.700
to understand that?

02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:52.100
And that the name fucked that system harder than any name has ever fucked a system.

02:11:54.180 --> 02:11:58.580
I agree that it's not one thing.

02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:04.980
There certainly is, to an extent, a majority thing that was absolutely a big thing.

02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:13.140
And along the lines of a saying that I've recently adopted, you cannot reproduce lightning

02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:14.100
in a bottle.

02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:16.180
And the Wii was lightning in a bottle.

02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:19.860
So when they focused on lightning in a bottle and it isn't that, well, it's a failure.

02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:20.820
No, it's not.

02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:23.860
There were still some pretty damn good elements of the Wii U.

02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:26.020
They just were seen in a different lens.

02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:29.780
Nintendo wanted the Wii U also, I think, on the technical level.

02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:35.860
You obviously, everybody sees how we got to the Switch from the Wii U.

02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:41.300
And I think a lot of people look at the Wii U and go, man, I bet Nintendo wanted that

02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:44.900
to be the Switch and they just couldn't bottle it.

02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:51.380
So they did what they thought was the next best thing and gave it a crappy name when

02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:54.740
it had nothing to do with what made the Wii the Wii.

02:12:54.740 --> 02:13:00.420
And then that's why now when they called it the Switch, now they go on Fallon, same

02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:03.140
fucking show, make a much better argument.

02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:07.220
But again, I'm trying not to keep falling back on the name thing, but it's important.

02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:12.660
I really, truly believe it was the biggest problem with that system and why it did so

02:13:12.660 --> 02:13:13.460
poorly.

02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:19.540
That and the crappy third party releases that were copies of year old games.

02:13:19.540 --> 02:13:20.660
But I digress.

02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:27.460
My point was Nintendo kind of, I think, was under a lot of pressure, probably from those

02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:33.780
same third parties that then gave them literal scraps for their system.

02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:39.380
I think Nintendo was under a lot of pressure to step it up from a technical perspective.

02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:47.620
Remember, the Wii could barely handle 480i in a day when HDTVs were taken off, right?

02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:53.620
HDTVs were unheard of in 2006, but the Wii could not output 720 pixels.

02:13:54.740 --> 02:14:01.140
So I think Nintendo was under a lot of pressure from third party companies to put out something

02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:06.420
technically advanced, but like that could be the Wii.

02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:12.180
And I think that's why Nintendo ultimately picked the name that fucked them, because

02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:16.100
they were trying to appease these third parties that left them at the altar.

02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:20.180
I swear this is exactly how it played out.

02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:24.180
They picked the name to appease the third parties who ended up stabbing them in the

02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:24.820
back at the end.

02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:26.500
Absolutely.

02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:29.380
And have been on again, off again.

02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:33.220
The Nintendo 64 was difficult to develop for intentionally.

02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:35.860
Yeah, the Nintendo relationship.

02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:42.900
Nintendo has always been a highly unique, has always carved out their highly unique

02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:50.020
niche, which was not as dramatic in the simpler times of gaming and is a lot worse.

02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:55.140
So now with the big in battles of Sony and Microsoft.

02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:56.180
And do you know why?

02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:58.340
Do you know why that's Nintendo's approach, Jason?

02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:01.220
Because now I know that's not what you called in about, but now you've got me on a whole

02:15:01.220 --> 02:15:03.540
other thing because I just had an aha moment.

02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:05.460
As you were saying, I had an aha moment.

02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:05.780
Fun.

02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:06.980
And it's how they see the world.

02:15:06.980 --> 02:15:11.780
No, this is because no, I'm talking about the third parties and why Nintendo is never

02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:20.660
really like them or have them in a place because Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment

02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:22.980
System under those pretenses.

02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:25.700
Think about this.

02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:30.020
When Nintendo came into the market, it was after the crash of 1984.

02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:32.580
What caused the crash of 1984?

02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:39.380
Atari money grabbing, terrible licensing deals, shitty ports, shitty adaptations.

02:15:39.380 --> 02:15:40.260
Ports weren't a thing.

02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:42.180
Literally terrible business decision.

02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:49.220
Everybody developing everything for the Atari started the crash of 1984.

02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:54.820
Chuck Purina Chuck Wagon caused the video game crash of 1984.

02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:55.220
Okay.

02:15:55.220 --> 02:15:56.660
And all of those things.

02:15:56.660 --> 02:16:00.580
So my whole point was Nintendo enters the market now with the Nintendo Entertainment

02:16:00.580 --> 02:16:01.140
System.

02:16:01.140 --> 02:16:03.300
And you may or may not recall this rule.

02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:08.020
Nintendo had a rule in place for the Nintendo Entertainment System, not the not the family

02:16:08.020 --> 02:16:11.460
seal of quality, not just that, but the yeah.

02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:16.660
Well, yeah, it was that because the whole we will not allow you to release more than

02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:22.740
three games a year under your label because of Atari, basically, is it was the unsaid

02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:24.580
part because of Atari.

02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:27.620
And so that's why get you Nintendo seal of quality.

02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:29.380
You can only get three games a year.

02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:32.180
This is why we got ultra games, right?

02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:37.060
Ultra games was just Konami trying to release three more games a year.

02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:40.340
And then suddenly people started to find their way around the seal of quality.

02:16:40.340 --> 02:16:44.900
And then at some point, ironically, Atari comes into the room and says, You know what?

02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:46.420
Fuck the seal of quality.

02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:49.460
We're going to reverse engineer our own fucking cartridge.

02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:51.140
And then that's a whole lawsuit, right?

02:16:51.140 --> 02:16:51.460
Colored.

02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:54.580
Yeah, that whole thing happens.

02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:59.380
And then now Nintendo has to retreat from that perspective a little bit, especially

02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:01.380
by the time the Super Nintendo comes out.

02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:09.540
But now Nintendo's culture, it's been set from 1985 or four when it no 1985 when the

02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:11.460
NES came out, not the Famicom NES came out.

02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:15.140
Nintendo has always seen the third party as the enemy.

02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:19.620
To say nothing about all the other times they've dipped their toes under the water and things

02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:20.500
have gone sideways.

02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:22.820
The Nintendo PlayStation, the CDI.

02:17:24.660 --> 02:17:30.980
So I mean, the DD, I think I assume I don't actually know enough about the DD, but certainly

02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:36.580
the Virtual Boy, they've had their fair flops that didn't even have the ability to permeate

02:17:36.580 --> 02:17:37.140
much longer.

02:17:37.140 --> 02:17:37.780
Let's be real.

02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:43.700
When Nintendo tried to allow themselves to be the third party, that led to that.

02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:47.860
Well, I mean, technically is more of a licensing IP agreement, but I was gonna say the CDI

02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:49.860
games were what they got out of that.

02:17:49.860 --> 02:17:54.900
And honestly, I can understand why Nintendo is like never again after that.

02:17:54.900 --> 02:18:00.260
Like it is written on a wall in a boardroom somewhere.

02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:01.140
Never again.

02:18:01.140 --> 02:18:07.300
And that was written on the wall in like 1998 or whenever that game was out and has not

02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:08.660
been removed ever since.

02:18:09.300 --> 02:18:14.660
Yeah, and it is unfortunate that they because they have their own opinions that go in their

02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:21.460
own direction and the switch isn't 10 times bigger volumetrically that it doesn't have

02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:27.380
the latest, the latest processor spec of the tech industry that drives the modern gaming

02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:28.020
industry.

02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:34.420
Yeah, it's a shame that things have to be lesser to fit on Switch on the flip side,

02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:36.660
the switches experience and everything else.

02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:41.620
I like I've told at least 10 people this over the last month.

02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:48.900
Odyssey, Breath of the Wild, Arceus and Kirby being open world, free form, smooth as hell

02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:53.060
are a joy and docked and portable.

02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:55.140
I don't give a shit that they don't look realistic.

02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:57.380
The games, you know, that's not the games motif anyways.

02:18:57.380 --> 02:19:04.260
But like these games for all of the series, like I've never beaten a Pokemon game until

02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:04.740
Arceus.

02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:05.780
I'm very close to it.

02:19:05.780 --> 02:19:08.580
I've never beaten a Zelda game until Breath of the Wild.

02:19:08.580 --> 02:19:12.740
I did do at least a base pack, not Champions Quest, blah, blah, blah.

02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:15.060
Yeah, Champions Quest.

02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:21.620
Like I subscribe to Nintendo's design principles.

02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:22.980
I play games for fun.

02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:26.180
I respect pro gamers.

02:19:26.740 --> 02:19:28.660
I respect speed runners.

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:29.460
I love watching.

02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:31.460
It could never do it like you do.

02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:32.820
You have your own opinion.

02:19:32.820 --> 02:19:34.500
I'm not saying don't do that.

02:19:34.500 --> 02:19:37.780
I'm saying that I enjoy what I get out of Nintendo.

02:19:37.780 --> 02:19:42.340
Yes, I would like most, but I'm going to take what I get and I'm going to take what I get

02:19:42.340 --> 02:19:43.860
and I enjoy it and I do.

02:19:43.860 --> 02:19:45.460
And that's kind of what drives me.

02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:50.580
Anyway, I think I took the car in a completely different direction from what you originally

02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:51.380
called in about, Jason.

02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:56.100
I'm sorry, but business people should not make artistic

02:19:56.100 --> 02:19:56.660
decisions.

02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:57.540
Okay, we agree on that.

02:19:57.540 --> 02:20:02.900
It's unfortunate that business people are driving art down people's throats as the primary

02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:03.300
asset.

02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:08.580
And this is completely an issue with the game industry completely because the people making

02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:10.100
decisions that are shitty.

02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:11.220
Let's say Bobby Kotick.

02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:13.140
Let's take the shittiest one of them all.

02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:15.060
The shittiest one of all time.

02:20:15.060 --> 02:20:17.460
The shittiest gaming executive of all time.

02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:18.260
Bobby Kotick.

02:20:19.380 --> 02:20:20.100
Not a gamer.

02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:21.620
Businessman.

02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:26.500
He's a lot of other crappy things, too, but he's definitely not a gamer.

02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:29.780
Now let's take one of the best in the industry right now.

02:20:29.780 --> 02:20:35.140
Phil Spencer and Microsoft Gamer came up from those rates.

02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:35.940
Huge advocate.

02:20:36.580 --> 02:20:38.260
Still doing the same thing that he's done best.

02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:41.140
These what, four, three, four generations after?

02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:48.020
And to Nintendo's credit and how they make such good fucking games, many of them came

02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:50.580
up the ranks, still play games.

02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:55.860
And there is a certain love of video games from those first party Nintendo developers

02:20:55.860 --> 02:21:04.740
from the House of Miyamoto, from that whole area, that whole team that feels such love

02:21:04.740 --> 02:21:09.220
for the video game that it shows in the product that comes out.

02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:15.860
It doesn't feel like a cash grab because Nintendo, for the most part, has been the last one to

02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:17.620
the party for most of those things.

02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:23.700
Not all of the time, but for the most part, we're not seeing shitty season passes in

02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:25.380
Pokemon Arceus, right?

02:21:27.300 --> 02:21:33.380
So the updates that they do put out, like the Breath of the Wild add ins, are entirely

02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:39.540
Nintendo DLC is usually for the most part, by and large, pretty good.

02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:42.020
Top line.

02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:43.060
Sorry.

02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:46.980
I said for the most part, don't fucking change the argument.

02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:47.560
Yeah.

02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:50.900
Switch online is a different problem.

02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:54.580
Art does not come from the place that business does, and business is too heartless to be

02:21:54.580 --> 02:21:55.080
art.

02:21:55.540 --> 02:22:01.060
And so when you make art via business, you get it wrong unless you're insanely lucky

02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:02.740
and you cannot design to be lucky.

02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:03.940
You just get lucky.

02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:05.140
This is the thing that happens.

02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:07.140
Quest Buster nails it, and I should have said this, too.

02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:12.580
Iwata came up the ranks as a programmer through HAL to head Nintendo years later and could

02:22:12.580 --> 02:22:13.780
still read code.

02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:18.100
That is why Balloon Fight, even if it's not your favorite Nintendo game, if there's a

02:22:18.100 --> 02:22:23.060
list of 10 Nintendo games you must play before you leave this world or whatever, Balloon

02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:24.580
Fight should be one of the 10.

02:22:24.580 --> 02:22:28.020
And I'm not saying Balloon Fight is the greatest NES game that was ever written.

02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:30.900
In fact, Balloon Fight is basically a Joust clone, right?

02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:34.340
Because that's what it was actually started to be written as.

02:22:34.340 --> 02:22:36.500
It was supposed to be just an NES port of Joust.

02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:39.540
But anyway, my point, and I think you all know what I'm getting to.

02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:41.620
That was a game that was made by Iwata.

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:46.820
So that is why you should play that game, because that was Iwata's game that he wrote

02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:48.420
as a programmer.

02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:55.380
And I think you should play that to see that's where he came through the ranks and designed

02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:55.780
that.

02:22:55.780 --> 02:23:01.700
And even if you look at it from the perspective of a Joust clone, it still added a new mode

02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:05.700
to the game that I think exceeded the clone part.

02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:06.500
You know what I mean?

02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:10.740
Like there's that base game that feels like Joust, but then there's that story mode that's

02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:13.380
like that eternal scroller to the left.

02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:19.700
That mode is remembered a lot more fondly than the mode that actually was the Joust

02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:20.340
part of the game.

02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:21.460
Oh, yeah.

02:23:21.460 --> 02:23:23.060
I don't remember that.

02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:26.180
I only remember the lock screen battle because you brought it up.

02:23:26.180 --> 02:23:30.660
The scroller is absolutely the adventure is what resonates in my brain.

02:23:30.660 --> 02:23:35.860
Technically, the lock screen battle was a vertical scroller on the versus portion of

02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:36.100
the game.

02:23:36.100 --> 02:23:38.100
But I think we get into semantics at that point.

02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:40.820
The point is a water wrote it.

02:23:40.820 --> 02:23:42.340
He put a spin on it.

02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:42.900
He made it.

02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:47.460
The spin was more memorable than what the game was trying to be in the first place.

02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:52.820
And I think you see that throughout Nintendo's history, which is why his loss was such a

02:23:52.820 --> 02:23:58.580
huge, like, just really like, you know, when that happened at Nintendo, you know, when

02:23:58.580 --> 02:24:01.140
that happened, it shows in the games that came out.

02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:06.820
I'm not saying it's all 100% bad, but you know, when a water passed away, Nintendo went

02:24:06.820 --> 02:24:08.100
through, you know, those anyway.

02:24:08.900 --> 02:24:09.460
I digress.

02:24:09.460 --> 02:24:17.300
Art is a vision and an opinion, sometimes a constraint, sometimes, you know, giving

02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:18.900
up one to satisfy the other.

02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:25.620
And business is all parts to is an all parts guess.

02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:27.540
And it's just not the same world.

02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:32.500
And I will lean in the direction of art over business, which is strange considering how

02:24:32.500 --> 02:24:34.420
otherwise I consider myself very objective.

02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:36.500
But that's me taking it in and not creating it.

02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:37.860
So I can be on the other side.

02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:42.660
I can go in what I like of art objectively and not produce.

02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:47.300
Hey, if Loki has proved anything, any idiot can make a game, Jason.

02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:49.940
Very true.

02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:52.820
And I say that I'll leave it to him.

02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:54.180
I say that would love Loki.

02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:55.700
Loki and Loki knows this.

02:24:55.700 --> 02:24:58.820
I go on to podcast panels at Dragon Con, whatever con I'm at.

02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:01.860
And I always say any idiot can podcast.

02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:02.660
I'm living proof.

02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:06.020
So all right, Jason.

02:25:06.020 --> 02:25:07.540
I'm going to wrap it up so we can take another call.

02:25:07.540 --> 02:25:10.660
But thank you and appreciate all you do for the show as always, of course.

02:25:10.660 --> 02:25:14.500
And yeah, any last quick thought before we let you go?

02:25:15.860 --> 02:25:16.980
I don't have a quick summary.

02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:19.140
Enjoy what you enjoy, folks.

02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:20.180
That's all that matters.

02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:20.660
Sounds good.

02:25:20.660 --> 02:25:21.380
Take care, my friend.

02:25:21.940 --> 02:25:22.500
Good night.

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:23.460
Good night.

02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:24.820
All right, let's go right into another call.

02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:27.620
We're going to bring somebody else here on air and get to it.

02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:29.620
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:30.020
Who's this?

02:25:32.660 --> 02:25:34.580
You're on mute and or you stepped away.

02:25:35.460 --> 02:25:36.820
I how about now?

02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:38.500
Hey, it's Rhonda.

02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:39.220
How's it going?

02:25:40.820 --> 02:25:42.980
Well, my voice is shot.

02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:45.460
I had a Philly cheesesteak.

02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:48.660
I am slowly unpacking from a convention.

02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:52.260
And the last talk with VX Jason XV.

02:25:52.260 --> 02:25:54.900
You got me wanting to talk about more stuff.

02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:56.740
So wow.

02:25:57.540 --> 02:25:59.380
Well, what do you want to talk about, please?

02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:03.460
Well, I just want to say, yeah, any idiot can podcast.

02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:04.740
I'm just saying, okay.

02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:10.740
And then there are some really smart people who can't podcast their way out of a paper bag.

02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:13.460
Also true, honestly.

02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:20.340
Well, that that is why there was a couple of things I want to talk about, but I can't

02:26:20.340 --> 02:26:23.540
remember most of it because I have the memory retention of a goldfish.

02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:26.740
But I want to say I was at a convention this weekend.

02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:27.460
It was great.

02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:28.500
It was fun.

02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:31.220
Rob, you would have blended in perfectly.

02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:36.180
There was a Rocky horror troop walking by, but I didn't get my camera ready in time.

02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:37.460
But that's the thing.

02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:42.500
But what I did was, I don't know if you've noticed, but a lot of conventions are having

02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:49.460
Twitch panels on how to set up streamlabs, how to set up OBS, how to do your layouts

02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:50.900
and all of this and all of that.

02:26:50.900 --> 02:26:53.460
And people are just going nuts.

02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:54.900
And streamlabs don't.

02:26:57.220 --> 02:26:58.660
Well, you're right.

02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:01.060
I'm Jamie.

02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:02.740
I'm old school.

02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:05.140
There are people who use USB microphones.

02:27:05.700 --> 02:27:07.780
I have a mixer and I plug everything in.

02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:15.300
Therefore, I did a panel called How to Podcast and Twitch Stream 101.

02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:22.340
Basically, dear weebs, dear newbies, you want a podcast?

02:27:22.980 --> 02:27:24.260
You want a Twitch stream?

02:27:24.980 --> 02:27:25.700
Okay.

02:27:25.700 --> 02:27:27.220
Get your wallets out.

02:27:27.220 --> 02:27:32.100
I'm going to tell you how much money you're going to have to spend if you want to do this.

02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:33.620
And that was the panel I did.

02:27:33.620 --> 02:27:35.700
And it went over pretty well.

02:27:35.700 --> 02:27:36.580
Congrats.

02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:40.100
Although I firmly believe and not everybody's with me.

02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:42.500
I firmly believe it takes zero dollars to podcast.

02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:44.340
Well, that's right.

02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:49.140
You might have to pay for your server space, I guess is probably the cost you really need.

02:27:49.140 --> 02:27:54.020
But like, honestly, actually, you could do that whole trick with archive.org and all

02:27:54.020 --> 02:27:55.140
that some people do.

02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:57.300
You still need access to a computer.

02:27:57.300 --> 02:27:59.620
You still need access to a microphone.

02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:02.340
So it does cost money.

02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:10.420
It may not cost a lot of money if you're going to have a very rudimentary podcast.

02:28:10.420 --> 02:28:10.660
Yeah.

02:28:11.220 --> 02:28:16.020
My point with all of that, because this topic has come up at Dragon Con, because there's

02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:18.180
a whole track about this stuff at Dragon Con, right?

02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:19.860
That's why I go there every year.

02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:27.460
But is that more people get hung up on the what are we going to talk about in each and

02:28:27.460 --> 02:28:28.660
every episode?

02:28:28.660 --> 02:28:35.860
People get more hung up on that or I need to have all of this technical stuff so I can

02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:39.540
get I if I don't have the perfect mic, if I don't have the perfect camera, I'm never

02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:40.420
going to be able to do this.

02:28:40.420 --> 02:28:47.140
People get hung up on that when the hardest part of podcasting is doing it every time

02:28:47.140 --> 02:28:48.180
regularly.

02:28:48.180 --> 02:28:49.380
That's the hardest part.

02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:52.100
You want to know something with Twitch?

02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:55.220
You don't need a camera to be a streamer.

02:28:55.220 --> 02:28:55.720
Same.

02:28:56.340 --> 02:28:57.060
And you want to know something?

02:28:57.060 --> 02:28:57.940
We covered that.

02:28:57.940 --> 02:29:01.700
Like in the beginning, I told people, you want a podcast?

02:29:01.700 --> 02:29:02.660
Open up notes.

02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:04.420
Start writing down ideas.

02:29:04.420 --> 02:29:05.620
Create an outline.

02:29:05.620 --> 02:29:06.500
Get this going.

02:29:07.220 --> 02:29:09.460
Every episode doesn't have to be the same.

02:29:09.460 --> 02:29:10.500
You can change.

02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:13.460
I even use Orange Dodge Radio as an example.

02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:17.940
I told people about Bemani DDR.

02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:23.860
Let's just say people were were excited and there is a fan of the show in my panel.

02:29:23.860 --> 02:29:32.340
So I explained how when DDR started going down, they switch gears and talked about gaming

02:29:32.340 --> 02:29:38.100
and it's been going great ever since I talked about how you don't need the most expensive

02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:38.980
equipment.

02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:43.620
I said, look, if you have a PC headset and everybody that you're chatting online with

02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:44.900
say you sound great.

02:29:44.900 --> 02:29:47.300
Start with that and you go from there.

02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:48.740
You want to record your show.

02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:50.420
You don't have the money for audition.

02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:54.020
There are free audio recording software applications out there.

02:29:54.020 --> 02:29:58.500
Sometimes when you buy your your equipment, it comes with free recording software.

02:29:58.500 --> 02:30:05.940
Like I did I did a review of a device and the company sent me another one to do another

02:30:05.940 --> 02:30:06.580
review on.

02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:10.900
This is a very simple audio interface, 60 bucks, and it works.

02:30:10.900 --> 02:30:15.780
I think I think it's not like the literal like zero dollars to podcast, but it's more

02:30:15.780 --> 02:30:20.420
the you would be surprised what you can do with what you already have or what you already

02:30:20.420 --> 02:30:21.460
have access to.

02:30:23.140 --> 02:30:29.700
So in that drawer of old tech and dig something out, I have a drawer right here and I could

02:30:29.700 --> 02:30:31.220
podcast anything on.

02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:32.500
I even forgot about this.

02:30:32.500 --> 02:30:35.140
Bobby in chat says you don't even need a computer anymore.

02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:37.860
Spreaker is a podcasting platform.

02:30:37.860 --> 02:30:39.940
You literally call in with your phone.

02:30:39.940 --> 02:30:42.420
You call it, do your stuff, hang up.

02:30:42.420 --> 02:30:44.820
It makes an audio file and updates an RSS feed.

02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:46.500
That's that's where we're at.

02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:51.220
That's wild, but that you can even do it with landline landline.

02:30:52.100 --> 02:30:54.340
I would personally rather sound good.

02:30:56.420 --> 02:31:02.580
But I mean, and all of the software that I use, I mean, I've got training on it, which

02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:07.380
is why I use Logic Pro and Final Cut for my video stuff.

02:31:08.020 --> 02:31:13.140
But if you've got a Mac, you get iMovie for free, you get GarageBand for free.

02:31:13.140 --> 02:31:17.300
And I can tell you right now that everything that I do in Logic, there are ways to do in

02:31:17.300 --> 02:31:18.340
GarageBand.

02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:22.740
You can do GarageBand on your phone or an iPad.

02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:29.300
I know plenty of people who make all of their music, do all of their promo video and their

02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:31.460
entire podcast from an iPad.

02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:35.860
This is where the technology has gotten us.

02:31:35.860 --> 02:31:37.300
I mean, it doesn't take much.

02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:42.580
I mean, I used to upload my podcast to one site when it was published, update the RSS

02:31:42.580 --> 02:31:44.580
feed, then post on the website.

02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:46.020
I do everything through Anchor FM.

02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:47.780
I upload it to there, they publish it.

02:31:47.780 --> 02:31:50.420
I just grab the link, post it on the website.

02:31:50.420 --> 02:31:50.660
Done.

02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:52.100
Here's the thing.

02:31:53.060 --> 02:31:56.660
And Bobby is bringing up the whole, if your audio is not good, then you shouldn't use

02:31:56.660 --> 02:31:59.300
it to podcast because I've had to turn off podcasts.

02:31:59.300 --> 02:32:02.500
I can't understand what people were saying because there were six people in a cavernous

02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:04.580
room sitting around an omnidirectional mic.

02:32:04.580 --> 02:32:05.300
Here's the thing.

02:32:05.940 --> 02:32:08.500
That show that Bobby's talking about can always get better.

02:32:09.220 --> 02:32:15.060
And as it continues to go on and they start to invest more time in it, they'll start

02:32:15.060 --> 02:32:18.740
to get that equipment and do those sorts of things and so forth.

02:32:18.740 --> 02:32:20.340
Those shows can always get better.

02:32:20.340 --> 02:32:21.700
Here's what won't get better.

02:32:21.700 --> 02:32:23.060
And this is the mistake.

02:32:24.100 --> 02:32:29.380
If I were to write that clickbait article, number one or number of reasons, number three

02:32:29.380 --> 02:32:30.020
will shock you.

02:32:30.020 --> 02:32:35.300
Here's number three reason why people get into podcasts and then end up not doing it

02:32:35.300 --> 02:32:43.460
is because if you spend $200 on a microphone, that $200 microphone is not going to stop

02:32:43.460 --> 02:32:46.420
you from saying, you know what?

02:32:46.980 --> 02:32:51.780
Let's record the podcast tomorrow because I'm going to go to the movies with my friends

02:32:52.580 --> 02:32:55.140
and I want to go see my friends and I can only do that right now.

02:32:56.100 --> 02:32:57.140
That $200 mic.

02:32:57.140 --> 02:33:01.940
Now, actually, some personalities would say, but the $200 mic actually motivates me to

02:33:01.940 --> 02:33:03.620
stay in and make that decision.

02:33:03.620 --> 02:33:04.020
Fine.

02:33:04.020 --> 02:33:05.140
You know if you're that type.

02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:10.340
But for most people, I think you see what I'm getting at is that the most expensive

02:33:10.340 --> 02:33:14.740
equipment in the world is not going to stop you from making a commitment to the recording.

02:33:14.740 --> 02:33:20.740
And when people ask how has OLR been so successful, how has OLR lasted as long as it has?

02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:25.940
Because it has gotten to a point where I don't know what else to do on Sunday nights.

02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:29.540
Rob, there's also one more thing, though.

02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:30.660
I like my ego to be fed.

02:33:31.780 --> 02:33:32.340
What's that?

02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:34.980
And a love.

02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:40.660
That is something that I said in my presentation, whether it's podcasting or Twitch streaming.

02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:45.300
Before you do any of it, you've got to have a love for it because let's be real.

02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:48.020
You're not going to make money off of this right away.

02:33:48.020 --> 02:33:52.340
There are those instances where you will jump right on and just start making money

02:33:52.340 --> 02:33:53.540
hand over fist.

02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:55.620
For some people, it takes time.

02:33:55.620 --> 02:33:56.740
It builds up.

02:33:58.100 --> 02:34:03.220
And we took, we fielded a lot of questions and a couple of them were, and I know we've

02:34:03.220 --> 02:34:09.380
probably all been there, where what do you do when you get up and you just don't feel

02:34:09.380 --> 02:34:10.420
like doing the show?

02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:17.380
One of my co-hosts, Wild Spice, who's also on my show from time to time, she fielded

02:34:17.380 --> 02:34:21.060
that pretty well because we also discussed mental health as well.

02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:26.260
She said that she took, she stopped Twitch streaming for a couple of years because of

02:34:26.260 --> 02:34:26.980
that.

02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:32.180
And then she started building right back up and getting right back into it.

02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:37.540
And I piggybacked off of that saying, as long as you have that feel, that love, you want

02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:38.820
to do it, then you do it.

02:34:38.820 --> 02:34:40.980
If you don't, then you don't.

02:34:40.980 --> 02:34:43.220
It's perfectly okay to take a break.

02:34:43.220 --> 02:34:46.980
If you hit that wall, just chill at the wall and relax.

02:34:47.060 --> 02:34:51.540
If you're on social media, let the fans know you are taking a break because you got to

02:34:51.540 --> 02:34:52.660
get yourself together.

02:34:53.380 --> 02:35:00.820
And when you come back, and when you have a migraine, no stream night, and I have said

02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:07.060
there have been times where I bring myself into doing this because I love it.

02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:09.700
The day that I wake up and say, you know what?

02:35:10.260 --> 02:35:11.860
This isn't fun anymore.

02:35:11.860 --> 02:35:13.220
I'm wrapping up the show.

02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:15.300
I'm probably going to end conventions.

02:35:15.300 --> 02:35:16.340
I'm, I'm done.

02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:19.140
I've hit where I'm like, I've done everything I wanted to do.

02:35:19.140 --> 02:35:20.900
I don't want to do anything else more.

02:35:20.900 --> 02:35:25.940
You know, and I guess it went over really well.

02:35:25.940 --> 02:35:31.860
And I think a lot of people in that panel understood there's a lot more that you got

02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:35.300
to do before you actually get into this.

02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:38.500
And I think another and I'm sorry, just real quick.

02:35:38.500 --> 02:35:42.020
Another thing, because and I see several people in chat talking about this, too, is that,

02:35:42.020 --> 02:35:44.980
you know, I don't know what my Sunday nights were before the show.

02:35:45.060 --> 02:35:46.180
This show had Matt.

02:35:46.180 --> 02:35:49.540
Bobby says, I'm afraid to go to a life where I don't do something like this on Sunday.

02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:50.340
It's like, I'll be fine.

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:51.780
I just don't want to get there.

02:35:51.780 --> 02:35:54.740
And it's important to say, oh, it's not going to be around forever.

02:35:54.740 --> 02:35:56.260
And I've said this a lot of times.

02:35:56.260 --> 02:35:58.260
There is going to come a day when the show is going to end.

02:35:58.260 --> 02:35:59.940
You know, it's going to happen.

02:35:59.940 --> 02:36:06.340
And I realize it's ironic for me to say this, but I need to say this for everything.

02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:08.980
It is okay for a podcast to end.

02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:12.100
It does not mean you are a failure.

02:36:12.100 --> 02:36:14.740
It does not mean your podcast was a failure.

02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:17.220
It does not mean any of that was a failure.

02:36:17.220 --> 02:36:19.460
You had moments.

02:36:19.460 --> 02:36:26.180
You had that piece of art that you put out however many times you did it.

02:36:26.180 --> 02:36:29.380
Five episodes, 50 episodes, 500 episodes.

02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:30.900
You still have that.

02:36:30.900 --> 02:36:32.500
That was a moment in time.

02:36:32.500 --> 02:36:34.100
That was a moment in your life.

02:36:34.820 --> 02:36:35.700
You're not a failure.

02:36:35.700 --> 02:36:38.260
So pod culture says, I feel like one sometimes.

02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:43.700
Well, let me tell you to stop because pod culture was a show that was on over 10 years.

02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:47.620
And you had a lot of great things that came out of it.

02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:50.580
You know, and plus it's not.

02:36:53.540 --> 02:36:59.380
What I say is it in the moments that you feel like a failure or discouraged?

02:37:00.020 --> 02:37:02.660
Actually, what I say is feel what you feel.

02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:04.180
Your feelings are valid.

02:37:04.180 --> 02:37:10.260
Do not ignore how you feel, but don't let how you feel limit you.

02:37:11.060 --> 02:37:11.780
It will pass.

02:37:12.740 --> 02:37:15.220
You just have to get up and get back on the horse.

02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:18.580
And you're going to feel like shit for a while.

02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:23.700
I feel like shit when I see one person on my stream.

02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:28.500
And when I get an email that tells me to go to the kitchen to make a sandwich.

02:37:28.500 --> 02:37:29.780
At least I did that one time.

02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:36.100
But my point is, is that you can use that feeling to motivate you.

02:37:36.740 --> 02:37:38.580
For me, I'm a very spiteful bitch.

02:37:39.460 --> 02:37:42.260
And you know how I am when I get spiteful?

02:37:42.260 --> 02:37:43.220
I make shit happen.

02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:47.060
So let it motivate you.

02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:48.180
Let it light a fire.

02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:53.940
If you don't want to feel like that, try to do more of the things that will lead away from that.

02:37:55.860 --> 02:38:00.020
I want to say, too, even though I said all that, I have had podcasts that have ended.

02:38:00.020 --> 02:38:02.660
Just remember, y'all, I did Hoard House.

02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:04.500
I did Pokestop Podcast.

02:38:04.500 --> 02:38:06.580
I have had a lot of podcasts that ended.

02:38:07.380 --> 02:38:08.660
And that's okay.

02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:11.620
Tara and I had our comics podcast.

02:38:12.180 --> 02:38:12.740
It's okay.

02:38:14.100 --> 02:38:15.140
Sometimes podcasts end.

02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:22.020
I think you also said, how do you motivate yourself when you don't feel like you're doing

02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:22.980
the show?

02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:29.220
And I say, try your very best to show up anyway, because the show might actually put you in

02:38:29.220 --> 02:38:30.020
a better mood.

02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:32.820
And I can't tell you how many times that's actually happened to me.

02:38:32.820 --> 02:38:36.180
I did not want to do the show, but I said, I'm committed.

02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:37.540
I don't break my commitments.

02:38:37.540 --> 02:38:38.660
Let's do it.

02:38:38.660 --> 02:38:44.900
I show up and you all being here and being as nice as you are, or we have a funny conversation

02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:46.820
or whatever happens is a funny night.

02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:48.020
And I'm like, you know what?

02:38:48.020 --> 02:38:51.380
I'm glad I did it anyway, even though I wasn't feeling at the moment.

02:38:51.380 --> 02:38:54.180
Now, some weeks are going to happen like last week.

02:38:54.820 --> 02:38:57.300
And I'll just address that again and say, you know what?

02:38:57.300 --> 02:38:58.660
There are going to be some nights.

02:38:58.660 --> 02:39:00.500
You do show up because you have a commitment.

02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:01.540
You do your thing.

02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:05.060
But there comes a moment where you and this is literally what you all saw me.

02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:08.180
I know you saw me go through this on air last night or last week.

02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:08.980
Excuse me.

02:39:08.980 --> 02:39:10.340
Is that mentally?

02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:17.460
I literally hit a wall and said, if I continue to do this, I'm going to start to resent what

02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:18.020
I'm doing.

02:39:18.580 --> 02:39:22.500
Therefore, I need to stop so that I can come back next week.

02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:24.820
And that's exactly what happened.

02:39:24.820 --> 02:39:25.860
And I'm here this week.

02:39:25.860 --> 02:39:35.380
And to kind of bring on top of that, during the pandemic, the height of it, somewhere

02:39:35.380 --> 02:39:40.180
in there, there was I got a message from Marco.

02:39:40.180 --> 02:39:44.100
She was like, I can't do the show tonight.

02:39:44.100 --> 02:39:45.380
I really can't.

02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:47.060
So I'm like, sure, no problem.

02:39:47.860 --> 02:39:48.580
I'll message it.

02:39:48.580 --> 02:39:50.900
You go and see if she wants to do the show.

02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:51.780
I message her.

02:39:52.420 --> 02:39:53.940
She's like, I can't.

02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:56.340
I my face isn't ready.

02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:58.580
I'm like, don't worry about it.

02:39:58.580 --> 02:39:59.140
It's good.

02:39:59.140 --> 02:40:00.420
So it's just me and Ari.

02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:04.580
So I message Wild Spice.

02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:07.860
She's like, I got to get up at five o'clock for work.

02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:11.140
I said, and I'm starting to feel it.

02:40:11.780 --> 02:40:14.580
And instead of getting frustrated, I said, you know what?

02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:16.420
No show.

02:40:17.700 --> 02:40:19.460
I posted on the Facebook page.

02:40:20.500 --> 02:40:21.780
No show tonight.

02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:23.460
Stay tuned for updates.

02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:28.180
I messaged everybody and I said, how would y'all feel if we did a show Wednesday?

02:40:28.900 --> 02:40:30.340
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:40:31.300 --> 02:40:31.940
Updated it.

02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:36.660
So episode Wednesday night, nine o'clock.

02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:37.300
Come on by.

02:40:38.020 --> 02:40:44.660
We did a show and we were actually raw and honest about why we didn't do a show Tuesday

02:40:44.660 --> 02:40:45.300
night.

02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:50.740
We spent a good time talking about mental health and how we just couldn't do it.

02:40:50.740 --> 02:40:52.180
And I was discussing that.

02:40:54.420 --> 02:41:01.060
As much as I would love to do an episode and if my friends, AK my staffers cannot do the

02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:03.540
show, I am not going to force them.

02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:04.820
I'm going to be like, you know what?

02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:06.260
I'm flipping the switch.

02:41:06.260 --> 02:41:08.500
I'm going to go jump on the Xbox for a while.

02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:10.580
We'll come back tomorrow.

02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:14.100
If that doesn't work, we'll come back next week.

02:41:14.100 --> 02:41:18.500
And if people have a problem with it, they don't have to listen anymore.

02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:20.900
This isn't a job.

02:41:20.900 --> 02:41:25.300
And we still have to remember we have to do the things that we enjoy, you know, or the

02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:27.060
commitments that are more important than this one.

02:41:27.060 --> 02:41:30.980
Like next month, there's going to be a show that Jamie misses because she's doing something

02:41:30.980 --> 02:41:32.980
special for herself for her birthday.

02:41:32.980 --> 02:41:34.900
A person ought to be able to do that.

02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:36.980
So, you know, the show will go on.

02:41:37.540 --> 02:41:42.660
Loki is I don't know how much I should say about Loki's going to be out for something,

02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:44.500
not doing something for something as well.

02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:45.780
Yeah, not for something special.

02:41:45.780 --> 02:41:46.740
Okay, that's all I'm going to say.

02:41:47.460 --> 02:41:49.220
And it's one special.

02:41:49.220 --> 02:41:53.460
It's it's one of those things, especially fun anyway.

02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:59.140
But the show will go on and well, I could say more, but I'm not going to say Loki might

02:41:59.140 --> 02:42:03.380
do the show anyway, but I'm just shouldn't go on.

02:42:03.380 --> 02:42:08.340
So so anyway, my point is, is that it's it's this isn't our job.

02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:11.060
And then again, it's that whole resentment when you start to feel.

02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:17.300
But again, part of the reason why the show has been successful is because I do also have

02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:19.620
that buy in from Dark Sakura and Loki.

02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:23.780
And the three of us that have done this show for so long is that we know we're committed

02:42:23.780 --> 02:42:24.580
to this show.

02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:31.620
But sure, other things are going to come up once in a while, but it needs to be once in

02:42:31.620 --> 02:42:32.420
a while.

02:42:32.420 --> 02:42:37.380
And in your case, you know, once in a while is sometimes going to be, hey, I hit a mental

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:38.260
wall tonight.

02:42:38.260 --> 02:42:40.740
I need to take a night for my mental health.

02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:43.540
Okay, that's all right.

02:42:43.540 --> 02:42:44.340
We'll try again next.

02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:46.980
Or in your case, you ended up being able to do it the next night.

02:42:46.980 --> 02:42:50.660
Again, you probably don't want to do that all that you don't want to live.

02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:51.860
Let's do it Wednesday.

02:42:52.420 --> 02:42:57.860
Have the that be the answer all the time, because then it's like your live audience

02:42:57.860 --> 02:42:59.860
doesn't know what time to commit to you.

02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:00.180
Right.

02:43:00.740 --> 02:43:04.020
But as a one off special thing, we did it in this case.

02:43:04.020 --> 02:43:04.660
Absolutely.

02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:06.440
Yeah.

02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:15.240
And before I wrap it up, someone in the audience wanted some advice on everything.

02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:20.920
I'll tell you what is the best way I could describe doing a podcast, doing a Twitch stream,

02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:24.040
the every investment, everything.

02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:26.600
And I said, well, I could tell you this.

02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:33.000
Now I have invested between upgrading my computer, my equipment and everything.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.280
I said I haven't spent over $3,000 in the last three to four years.

02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:43.800
And I have zero regrets because my computer, when it's done being a podcasting Twitch streaming

02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:45.800
machine, it's a gaming machine.

02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:46.360
It's a video.

02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:47.400
It does a lot more things.

02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:50.520
That's what I made sure of and to follow up with.

02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:53.880
And I told them this is what I end my show with.

02:43:53.880 --> 02:43:56.440
And maybe this will give you some motivation.

02:43:57.480 --> 02:43:58.760
Hey, thank you for listening.

02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:00.600
Thank you for participating.

02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:01.640
I'm DJ Ron mess.

02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:02.840
These are my co hosts.

02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:07.080
We are independent podcasters, independent bloggers.

02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:08.840
We do this for the fun of it.

02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:10.520
What we like and don't like.

02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:12.040
We're going to tell you upfront.

02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:14.840
If you have any questions about the show, you can drop us a line.

02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:16.600
Email address below.

02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:19.180
All right.

02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:24.440
Any other last thoughts for us, Rama, before we let you go?

02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:27.320
And we anticipate the next episode of Anime Jam Session.

02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:28.520
Congrats on the panel, by the way.

02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:29.320
It sounds like it was great.

02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:30.440
Thank you.

02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:34.280
I will say I was inspired by you doing these panels.

02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:36.920
And I felt that, you know, they're doing all these.

02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:41.880
Someone needs to tell these kids how to do it.

02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:44.520
You know, so figure out the Reeses keys.

02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:46.040
Exactly.

02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:47.800
Exactly.

02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:49.480
All right, my friend.

02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:50.360
I'm going to let you go.

02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:51.400
Have a wonderful night.

02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:52.760
Thanks for calling in tonight.

02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:54.280
It's always good to hear from you.

02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:55.240
You all take care.

02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:56.840
I love every single one of you.

02:44:56.840 --> 02:44:57.560
All right.

02:44:57.560 --> 02:44:58.040
Love you too.

02:44:58.040 --> 02:44:58.280
Bye.

02:44:59.160 --> 02:44:59.660
Bye.

02:45:00.060 --> 02:45:00.700
All right.

02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:03.660
Always good to hear from our friend DJ Rama S.

02:45:04.540 --> 02:45:09.340
In the meantime, I think we have probably hit about the end of everything we have tonight.

02:45:09.340 --> 02:45:10.780
There's nobody else in the green room.

02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:13.180
I think we've gotten through all the emails.

02:45:13.180 --> 02:45:16.380
I will quickly look to Matt to see if there's any last minute stories.

02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:24.060
I just want to mention that Epic and Fortnite have raised over 70 million dollars for Ukraine

02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:27.260
because they're doing a fundraising thing with that.

02:45:27.260 --> 02:45:27.820
That's great.

02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:34.460
I'm sure much more fundraisers to come as this unfortunate issue just keeps going.

02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:39.980
What ended up happening was that Epic had raised over 35 million dollars and then Xbox

02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:43.260
decided that they're also going to match it, I believe.

02:45:43.980 --> 02:45:44.940
So that's how it doubled.

02:45:48.220 --> 02:45:48.700
All right.

02:45:49.660 --> 02:45:52.860
Well, with that, we will move to wrap up the show.

02:45:53.420 --> 02:45:57.980
Um, and before I get to final thoughts, let me say thank you as always for listening to

02:45:57.980 --> 02:45:59.660
Orange Lawns Radio and participating with the show.

02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:02.540

02:46:02.540 --> 02:46:03.340
We are.

02:46:03.340 --> 02:46:05.340
Please tell a friend about the show.

02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:09.580
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to help get out here

02:46:09.580 --> 02:46:10.300
on air.

02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:12.940
So please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:46:12.940 --> 02:46:17.420
A nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you heard about this podcast

02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:18.860
and are consuming this podcast.

02:46:18.860 --> 02:46:21.500
Please consider a five star rating and a nice review.

02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:23.260
It really does go a long way.

02:46:23.260 --> 02:46:26.380

02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:37.100
Session that we were just talking to one of the hosts there.

02:46:38.060 --> 02:46:40.860
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and we'll wrap it up.

02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:43.180
Dark Sakura, I know you want to get to the killings.

02:46:43.180 --> 02:46:44.620
So I'll start with you and your final thought.

02:46:45.580 --> 02:46:53.420
Um, I, I'm doing a birthday marathon on April 14th from 10 30 a.m. to 10 30 p.m.

02:46:54.060 --> 02:46:57.500
Come hang out with me for my birthday on my channel.

02:46:58.140 --> 02:46:58.540
The end.

02:46:59.660 --> 02:46:59.980
All right.

02:46:59.980 --> 02:47:00.860
Best of luck with that.

02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:02.220
Thanks.

02:47:02.220 --> 02:47:02.620
Bye.

02:47:02.620 --> 02:47:02.940
All right.

02:47:02.940 --> 02:47:03.180
Bye.

02:47:04.140 --> 02:47:04.620
All right.

02:47:04.620 --> 02:47:06.540
And we'll go over to Loki.

02:47:06.540 --> 02:47:07.820
Your final thought tonight, Loki.

02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:12.060
Uh, final thought is I've got to work hard to put out some more videos.

02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:13.580
Mm hmm.

02:47:13.580 --> 02:47:15.100
Hopefully those will be coming soon.

02:47:15.100 --> 02:47:15.420
Yeah.

02:47:15.420 --> 02:47:19.980
I really need to, um, get on producing more of that type of content too.

02:47:19.980 --> 02:47:23.500
I keep meaning to, but you know, other things like the shows and stuff.

02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:27.580
But speaking of shows, my final thought will be, uh, the next show I'll be hosting at the

02:47:27.580 --> 02:47:28.780
end of April.

02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:30.460
Um, it's not really a live event.

02:47:30.460 --> 02:47:34.540
We're just, we're just doing basically a movie double feature with a costume contest,

02:47:34.540 --> 02:47:39.660
but I'm really still excited about it because we're doing Goth Night Out and we're showing

02:47:39.660 --> 02:47:45.100
The Crow and The Craft, which are two quintessential goth movies.

02:47:45.100 --> 02:47:46.460
And I'm really excited about it.

02:47:46.460 --> 02:47:48.460
So that's going to be a show at the end of April.

02:47:48.460 --> 02:47:52.460
Um, the hosting gods have been very good to me this year and I'm so thankful for it.

02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:56.300
Like, you know, between having John Waters a few weeks ago, unfortunately, Leslie and

02:47:56.300 --> 02:47:58.380
Warren had to cancel on the clue thing.

02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:01.900
Um, that was a bucket list item, but you know what, at the end of the day, the performance

02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:03.100
was still awesome.

02:48:03.100 --> 02:48:04.780
Hosting it was fantastic.

02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:06.060
The audience was great.

02:48:06.060 --> 02:48:08.060
I did something I rarely ever do.

02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:13.420
And I actually wrote a little bit of standup to do, and it was all clue themed and it went

02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:14.220
over well.

02:48:14.220 --> 02:48:16.620
So that made me feel a little bit better about my abilities.

02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:19.420
That's why my nails are black, by the way, because somebody was asking about that in

02:48:19.420 --> 02:48:23.900
chat earlier is because, um, if you're not doing, if you, if you're not, what is the,

02:48:23.900 --> 02:48:25.580
the line in the Alaska song?

02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:28.140
If you're not doing nails, you're not doing drag.

02:48:28.140 --> 02:48:33.100
And so I painted my nails and I was like, well, black, black nails I can keep, uh, for

02:48:33.100 --> 02:48:33.420
a little bit.

02:48:33.420 --> 02:48:37.180
It's not, you know, whatever, uh, fallout boy and all those bands they have, they started

02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:38.220
that trend for men.

02:48:38.220 --> 02:48:38.940
So it doesn't matter.

02:48:38.940 --> 02:48:39.980
Have you ever painted your nails?

02:48:39.980 --> 02:48:40.380
Loki?

02:48:42.140 --> 02:48:42.780
No, no.

02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:44.060
You know what?

02:48:44.060 --> 02:48:45.420
Honestly, I'll say this.

02:48:45.420 --> 02:48:47.660
If nothing else, paint them clear.

02:48:47.660 --> 02:48:50.540
And I've done that because clear stopped me from biting them.

02:48:50.540 --> 02:48:53.980
That's why that's, that's the one that clear nail polish will stop you from biting your

02:48:53.980 --> 02:48:54.860
nails real quick.

02:48:54.860 --> 02:49:00.140
So I would recommend that to anybody, um, regardless how you feel about colorful nail

02:49:00.140 --> 02:49:01.340
polish on your own person.

02:49:02.060 --> 02:49:07.500
Um, anyway, that is, uh, it's, we'll do this again next week.

02:49:07.500 --> 02:49:10.140
Uh, I didn't mention this on the show.

02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:12.380
I'm going to Las Vegas this weekend.

02:49:12.380 --> 02:49:14.140
I will be back for OLR.

02:49:14.140 --> 02:49:17.260
We're taking a Saturday flight back because it's cheaper.

02:49:17.260 --> 02:49:23.180
Um, so, uh, we, with the state holiday on Thursday, we're kind of shifting our weekend

02:49:23.180 --> 02:49:28.460
a little bit, but I'm very excited about it and I get to cross off my bucket list.

02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:33.420
We're seeing Dionne Warwick live, and I'm so excited about that because I love Dionne

02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:36.300
Warwick and her Twitter presence and all that is fantastic.

02:49:36.300 --> 02:49:39.100
So, uh, I will tell you all about that next week.

02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:40.620
All right, we're out of here.

02:49:40.620 --> 02:49:41.900
It's a time to end the show.

02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:42.780
Have a good night, everybody.

02:49:42.780 --> 02:49:43.580
We'll see you next time.

02:49:46.460 --> 02:49:48.940

02:49:50.940 --> 02:49:58.060
