WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm going to spoil how tonight's show ends.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.700
Our final thoughts on the outro!

00:13.700 --> 00:14.760
Just kidding, that too!

00:14.760 --> 00:18.060
But tonight we're ending the show with happy feels about a streamer finding a literally

00:18.060 --> 00:22.020
priceless, authentically one-of-a-kind item and NOT holding it for ransom.

00:22.020 --> 00:25.660
A rush of positivity to break the streak of headline topics that shall not be named, whose

00:25.660 --> 00:28.940
value is 100% artificial and dubious to get there too.

00:28.940 --> 00:30.980
This is a rush of serotonin and fuzzy feelings.

00:30.980 --> 00:33.840
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

00:33.840 --> 00:36.480
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show, where every

00:36.480 --> 00:39.000
gamer has a voice.

00:39.000 --> 00:47.100
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:47.100 --> 00:49.280
where every gamer has a voice.

00:49.280 --> 00:56.520
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 905 of our

00:56.520 --> 01:00.380
show for tonight, March the 6th of 2022.

01:00.380 --> 01:05.420
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always is Midna.

01:05.420 --> 01:09.700
Say hello to Midna, licking and grooming herself back there on the chair.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.260
On my bathrobe.

01:11.260 --> 01:13.700
Being supervised by Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.340
Yes, she's doing quite well.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.740
How are you, Dark Sakura?

01:17.740 --> 01:18.740
I'm all right.

01:18.740 --> 01:21.220
I've had a longer day than I wanted to.

01:21.220 --> 01:22.860
I got a bad haircut on Friday.

01:22.860 --> 01:23.860
Oh no.

01:23.860 --> 01:24.860
Like really bad.

01:24.860 --> 01:25.860
Oh no.

01:25.860 --> 01:26.860
I had to get it fixed.

01:26.860 --> 01:27.860
So hold on.

01:27.860 --> 01:30.920
Oh, but your hair looks great.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.600
It's a lot shorter than I wanted it.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.280
Oh, it looks great though.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.000
Well, thank you.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.880
The back is still a little bit messed up, but she couldn't really do much else for where

01:39.880 --> 01:40.880
it was cut.

01:40.880 --> 01:46.640
So I'm going to get it redone in another couple of months.

01:46.640 --> 01:54.000
So yeah, I had to wait 50 minutes to get in at Great Clips today.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.040
I knew if I was going in for a blunt cut, they do a great job and they're cheap.

02:00.040 --> 02:04.380
And I'm sorry to the podcast listeners because they cannot see your hair because it's audio

02:04.380 --> 02:05.820
only when it's podcasts.

02:05.820 --> 02:10.740
But remember we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash vog network at the

02:10.740 --> 02:16.060
voice of geeks network, EOG network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after

02:16.060 --> 02:17.380
the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:17.380 --> 02:20.500
And you can see things like Dark Sakura's fabulous hair.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.720
And you know what, even if you're listening on the podcast feed, hopefully we get a clip

02:23.720 --> 02:24.880
or two tonight.

02:24.880 --> 02:27.640
Sometimes people clip the shows and you can see it that way.

02:27.640 --> 02:32.680
Or if you want actually expect a Pantene moment for me, if you want the entire video archive,

02:32.680 --> 02:36.820
you can always drop a subscription for a very, very small amount of money over at twitch.tv

02:36.820 --> 02:37.820
slash vog network.

02:37.820 --> 02:42.880
In fact, if you're a prime Amazon prime person, you get a free sub every month.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.560
So why not spend it at vog network?

02:44.560 --> 02:46.460
Don't let it go to waste.

02:46.460 --> 02:49.720
Someone who I know spends lots of his prime subs at vog network.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.800
Say hello to tech master Loki.

02:51.800 --> 02:52.800
Actually it's not true.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.360
We don't spend actual subs on our network.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.280
I don't know where the prime one goes.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.840
I was just at my transition.

02:58.840 --> 03:01.360
There could have been better, but that's all I had.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.360
What is it?

03:02.360 --> 03:07.220
Is this is that supermarket scream that game that just came out of the supermarket streak.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.220
That's it.

03:08.220 --> 03:11.480
I was like, I played that cause the listeners were saying I should check that out and it's

03:11.480 --> 03:12.480
cute.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.160
And I like the one you have to yell into a microphone thing.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.160
I think so.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.160
Yeah.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.160
It's a mechanic.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.680
I think it's an optional mechanic though.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.680
I'm pretty sure.

03:22.400 --> 03:27.080
So, um, and I did, I also, uh, to go back to dark soccer real quick, I wanted to compliment

03:27.080 --> 03:28.080
your R-type shirt.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.080
I see you wearing.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.080
Oh yeah.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.080
I'll stay there.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.880
We got a lot of classic gamer paraphernalia.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.520
Oh yeah, I do too.

03:34.520 --> 03:39.760
I just, it's under my shirt, so I have to like, you know, don't take your clothes off

03:39.760 --> 03:40.760
on air.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.680
That's against TOS, but like, oh, that's an awesome shirt.

03:44.680 --> 03:45.680
Wow.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.680
And wait here.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.680
Hold on.

03:47.680 --> 03:48.680
Hold on.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.560
Cause hi, by the way, uh, since the last episode I've worked on my sound and I think tonight

03:51.560 --> 03:54.680
should be a lot better, uh, from the sound perspective.

03:54.680 --> 03:55.880
So yeah, there we go.

03:55.880 --> 04:01.800
Uh, basically a long story short, I was using a setting on gain that worked for my personal

04:01.800 --> 04:04.080
streaming, but it was really bad for podcasting.

04:04.080 --> 04:07.360
I have now fixed my setup to look a lot like dark soccer and Loki.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.440
And that's actually what I thought of is I was like, you know what?

04:09.440 --> 04:11.920
I bet it's because the gain is just too high.

04:11.920 --> 04:15.240
I need to put it on the lowest setting and have the mic right in front of my face.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.660
And sure enough, that is the, that is the trick.

04:17.660 --> 04:19.900
And then I have a brand new pop filter as well.

04:19.900 --> 04:24.420
So I can say words like popcorn and it won't drive people crazy anyway, but behind this

04:24.420 --> 04:25.420
is my shirt.

04:25.420 --> 04:26.420
I found this one.

04:26.420 --> 04:27.420
I was moving.

04:27.420 --> 04:28.420
You ready?

04:28.420 --> 04:29.420
You ready?

04:29.420 --> 04:35.780
Nice lens arcade 1983 is what that shirt says.

04:35.780 --> 04:36.780
Nice.

04:36.780 --> 04:38.380
I don't think I've worn that since 1983.

04:38.380 --> 04:39.380
No, just kidding.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.980
It was a, it was a more recent than that, but it's one of those shirts that got like

04:43.980 --> 04:47.740
at the bottom of the closet, at the end of the shirt pile and just didn't wear it for

04:47.740 --> 04:48.740
forever.

04:48.740 --> 04:51.900
And then as we were moving, I was like, Oh, this shirt, I need to put this back up on

04:51.900 --> 04:52.900
top of the pile.

04:52.900 --> 04:53.900
It's nice.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.980
Incentivizes you not to have a shirt pile.

04:56.980 --> 04:57.980
Absolutely not.

04:57.980 --> 04:59.700
We have too many shirts, dark soccer.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.700
That's a problem.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.700
Too many shirts.

05:01.700 --> 05:02.700
That's it.

05:02.700 --> 05:03.700
Your house for me present is coat hangers.

05:03.700 --> 05:04.700
Actually.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.620
Well, we got for t-shirts though.

05:06.620 --> 05:07.620
We have plenty of coat hangers.

05:07.620 --> 05:08.620
I hang up all my t-shirts.

05:08.620 --> 05:09.620
Really?

05:09.620 --> 05:10.620
We don't hang up the t-shirts.

05:10.620 --> 05:11.620
We fold them and put them in drawers.

05:12.260 --> 05:16.060
Well, I mean, I have like my tank tops are all folded up, but most of my t-shirts get

05:16.060 --> 05:19.420
hung up so they don't get like super wrinkled.

05:19.420 --> 05:25.780
We used to fold them and put them in a drawer for t-shirts for like work button up shirts,

05:25.780 --> 05:31.220
like, like Loki's outer shirt that I would have on a closet if I own that, but I don't.

05:31.220 --> 05:34.940
Anyway, enough about closet life.

05:34.940 --> 05:41.040
Wait until you see the closet at this place though, dark soccer, you're going to be like,

05:41.040 --> 05:42.620
you came out of the closet.

05:42.620 --> 05:45.340
Why do you have such a big closet now?

05:45.340 --> 05:47.120
Is it bigger than my closet?

05:47.120 --> 05:48.120
Yes.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.860
I keep joking with Alan.

05:49.860 --> 05:52.040
It's my drag closet, which I don't.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.360
Cause I have a pretty big walk-in closet.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.840
All right.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.480
I'll show you when you're here.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.480
Anyway.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.000
So that'll be the guest bedroom then, right?

06:01.000 --> 06:05.760
No, the guest bedroom kind of pairs with, well, actually we have a legit, we have a

06:05.760 --> 06:08.980
legit Harry Potter room under the stairs.

06:08.980 --> 06:12.620
And I keep joking that we're going to put like a love sack in there or something.

06:12.620 --> 06:16.980
And that can be the, I told you I've slept in one of those before, right?

06:16.980 --> 06:22.180
That was like episode two of OLR, which you were on a trip.

06:22.180 --> 06:25.520
They had to clean the mattress very well before I was sleeping on it.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.260
So just letting you know, it was the frat house.

06:29.260 --> 06:33.440
We're going to go on and get into gaming news for tonight.

06:33.440 --> 06:37.460
And actually starting with a little bit of a look back because I, this, and this is one

06:37.460 --> 06:41.540
of the things where, you know, when we talk about how old something is in gaming, which

06:41.540 --> 06:46.300
happens a lot during the classic game of the week, we have a moment of, Oh my God, really?

06:46.300 --> 06:48.340
Like, Oh, I feel so old.

06:48.340 --> 06:51.380
I don't know if tonight is one of those, but it's one of those that kind of surprises me

06:51.380 --> 06:53.020
that this has been around this long.

06:53.020 --> 06:59.400
And that is the Nintendo switch this week, uh, as of March 3rd, I believe turns five

06:59.400 --> 07:00.520
years old.

07:00.520 --> 07:04.220
The Nintendo switch has been out for five years.

07:04.220 --> 07:06.880
Just me saying that, does that surprise you?

07:06.880 --> 07:08.680
Does it felt like five years?

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
Loki?

07:09.680 --> 07:16.460
Uh, no, because I don't think I picked it up right when it came out, but I don't really

07:16.460 --> 07:19.980
keep track of time for that system.

07:19.980 --> 07:24.040
I guess I can't really remember when like any of these last few systems came out.

07:24.040 --> 07:30.480
I remember like the Xbox three 60 and like that generation of systems, but the last two

07:30.480 --> 07:32.680
generations I'm not really keeping track.

07:33.120 --> 07:38.800
Well, I think also for me, like the pandemic has been a big, like warp on time, you know,

07:38.800 --> 07:42.760
like, um, make a play a pun on Mario and talk about warping.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.720
Like I feel like the pandemic has really warped sense of time.

07:46.720 --> 07:50.900
And although, you know, perhaps one of the biggest highlights of the Nintendo switch

07:50.900 --> 07:57.320
has been the fact that it was there for animal crossing, you know, when we all needed it

07:57.320 --> 08:03.800
in March of 2020, um, it's just kind of fascinating to think like, Oh yeah, like the, this, that

08:03.800 --> 08:05.480
system has been around five years.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.640
I don't even really know where the last two years really went.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.640
I don't know.

08:09.640 --> 08:10.640
That's how I feel sometimes.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.640
Yeah.

08:11.640 --> 08:15.400
I'm going to chat and looking at some comments there, because again, we do tape live over

08:15.400 --> 08:17.280
twitch.tv slash vog network.

08:17.280 --> 08:21.900
And I like to read comments from chat, including Zen monkey 11, who says the switch feels like

08:21.900 --> 08:23.560
seven years.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.560
It's annoying.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.600
Um, let's see.

08:25.600 --> 08:30.880
Fifth dream says five years time to obsolete every game and resell them on a 10% upgraded

08:30.880 --> 08:31.880
switch too.

08:31.880 --> 08:37.560
Well, fifth dream, you know, there's a lot of speculation that a switch pro was supposed

08:37.560 --> 08:42.760
to happen and didn't because of, um, the pandemic basically long story short.

08:42.760 --> 08:46.880
Well, there is, uh, the, I don't know if we have a story on it or whatever.

08:46.880 --> 08:53.200
There's a, a hack that happened with Nvidia or yeah, we talked about it last week.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.200
Um, I think the hack came up last week, but I'm not sure the switch thing came up until

08:57.200 --> 08:58.200
this week.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.200
Yeah.

08:59.200 --> 09:03.620
The, some of the stuff that was in there was a chip set that was allegedly for them new

09:03.620 --> 09:04.620
switch.

09:04.620 --> 09:05.620
Yeah.

09:05.620 --> 09:06.620
Fascinating.

09:06.620 --> 09:12.960
Well, I mean, Nintendo working on a new console, of course they are eventually.

09:12.960 --> 09:13.960
We know that, right?

09:13.960 --> 09:15.240
Just like, Hey, guess what?

09:15.240 --> 09:17.120
Sony's working on a PlayStation six.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.120
Yep.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.120
They are.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.240
That doesn't mean it's coming out this year or anytime soon, but Sony is working on the

09:22.240 --> 09:23.840
PlayStation six.

09:23.840 --> 09:24.840
Believe it.

09:24.840 --> 09:28.720
Microsoft is working on the Xbox, whatever, whatever they're going to call it.

09:28.720 --> 09:29.720
Absolutely.

09:29.720 --> 09:35.680
So, um, let's see, uh, other comments from chat here, uh, E3VL says, I don't feel like

09:35.680 --> 09:37.860
they'll do a switch to anytime soon.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.280
There's Mario Kart eight deluxe DLC.

09:40.280 --> 09:45.720
That certainly does seem to mean that like Mario Kart nine, but what if Nintendo were

09:45.720 --> 09:51.960
to like, I don't know, actually do backwards compatibility, uh, a little better.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.960
And that even if you bought that Mario Kart eight stuff, it'll work on your next system.

09:55.960 --> 09:56.960
Who knows?

09:56.960 --> 09:57.960
Weird.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.400
Nintendo used to be like the Kings backwards compatibility, which is weird because super

10:01.400 --> 10:06.540
Nintendo and Nintendo weren't exactly backwards compatible, but like we had the game boy player

10:06.540 --> 10:09.160
on the super Nintendo, which kind of opened some things.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.520
It's just so weird.

10:10.520 --> 10:15.800
How things have come full circle in that regard where Nintendo now is like, they're not great

10:15.800 --> 10:16.800
at it.

10:16.800 --> 10:21.160
You know, we had that whole bit last week about how would the Wii U going away, there's

10:21.160 --> 10:25.280
not really going to be as many games that are archived because of rights issues and

10:25.280 --> 10:31.000
bad about about, um, did you, Rama S says we need a 3d S player for switch.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Absolutely.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Absolutely.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.600
You could flip a switch on its side, meaning like a vertical screen and emulate a 3d S

10:37.600 --> 10:38.600
easily.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.760
I really wish they would do that.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.360
I really, really wish they would do that.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.360
Um, let's see.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.120
There was one other comment here I wanted to read.

10:49.080 --> 10:54.680
Tiger class says the fact that switch is five years old is a testament to its longevity.

10:54.680 --> 11:00.560
Well, speaking of that, there are some sites that are talking about and having a nice look

11:00.560 --> 11:06.240
back on, or, or yes, look forward to this particular year and how, yeah, the switch

11:06.240 --> 11:11.020
is five years in, but this seems like it's going to be its biggest year yet.

11:11.020 --> 11:15.760
And I'm looking specifically at an article on Engadget, one of those tech websites, um,

11:15.760 --> 11:20.100
that does a lot of, um, you know, uh, blogs and things about what's going on in the tech

11:20.100 --> 11:21.100
world.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.100
And they write about gaming as well.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.360
That's where joystick used to be.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.600
Remember, remember joystick years and years ago.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.260
Um, and they're running an article this week that says Nintendo switch is about to hit

11:29.260 --> 11:31.000
its prime.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.720
And it's interesting because they're talking about, okay, so the Nintendo gave us Zelda

11:35.720 --> 11:37.900
breath of the wild.

11:37.900 --> 11:41.280
Technically the Wii U gave us that, but I, I get the point.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.280
Yes.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.440
Uh, things like Xenoblade Chronicles two splatoon two and so forth.

11:45.440 --> 11:53.040
And then it talks about this year, Pokemon legends, Arceus, Arceus, Arceus, whatever

11:53.040 --> 11:54.880
that game came out in January.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.880
Right?

11:55.880 --> 11:56.880
So that's the start of the year.

11:56.880 --> 12:03.280
Then we find out last week, Pokemon, violet, Pokemon, scarlet, late 2022, Kirby in the

12:03.280 --> 12:04.440
forgotten land.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.160
Just got a demo this week that some of you are playing, right?

12:07.160 --> 12:11.040
That's going to be out in March legend of Zelda breath of the wild too.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.480
They're saying it's 2022.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.480
They're saying that.

12:14.480 --> 12:18.000
Well, we'll see, but we're, they're saying it splatoon three.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.380
Maybe that's why Pokemon stuff's coming out at the end of the year now.

12:22.380 --> 12:28.540
Splatoon three this summer, Mario and rabbits, sparks of hope coming up, Bayonetta three,

12:28.540 --> 12:29.540
it's real.

12:29.540 --> 12:34.440
And it's coming out in 2022 advanced wars, one plus two, no man's sky.

12:34.440 --> 12:39.800
Finally getting ported an oxen free sequel, Xenoblade Chronicles three, Wii sports, but

12:39.800 --> 12:45.080
for the switch switch sports, a new Mario strikers title, you see where I'm going?

12:45.080 --> 12:52.600
This year is fucking stacked for the Nintendo switch, especially compared to 2020 and 2021.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.800
I mean, don't get me wrong.

12:53.800 --> 12:58.960
Animal crossing was absolutely bad-ass and huge for 2020, but we know in a lot of ways

12:58.960 --> 13:04.680
the pandemic kind of messed with things in a way where I think a lot of games that probably

13:04.680 --> 13:05.680
would have been out sooner.

13:05.680 --> 13:09.400
I think Arceus really was supposed to be last year.

13:09.400 --> 13:13.720
It really was, but it's been delayed for a variety of reasons and whatever it came out

13:13.720 --> 13:14.720
this year.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.480
I think there's a lot of things where the pandemic just threw the timetable off animal

13:18.480 --> 13:19.520
crossing DLC.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.400
I think that's part of the reason that took so long as well.

13:22.400 --> 13:29.720
So it seems like just now everything is hitting this year, but it is interesting for a system

13:29.720 --> 13:34.480
that we keep saying, Oh, they're going to do a switch to, Oh, there's a switch pro.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.640
Oh, there's all of this coming.

13:36.640 --> 13:41.240
Why this year so fucking stacked for the Nintendo switch.

13:41.240 --> 13:45.680
Let me ask my co-hosts if they have any perspective on this.

13:45.680 --> 13:52.480
Why is 2022 so stacked for the Nintendo switch compared to 2020 and 2021?

13:52.480 --> 13:57.640
This stuff got delayed until this year.

13:57.640 --> 14:03.120
How about development, hardware shortages for development?

14:03.120 --> 14:04.680
Like dev kits and things like that.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.680
Yeah.

14:05.680 --> 14:10.360
And part of the problem could be, could be, I mean, some of these are Nintendo's own studios,

14:10.360 --> 14:11.360
but I get it.

14:11.360 --> 14:12.360
I get it.

14:12.360 --> 14:16.960
You know, if it's not even just maybe development from the sense of the actual professional

14:16.960 --> 14:21.200
hours, we know that was all disrupted because of the pandemic.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.200
Absolutely.

14:22.200 --> 14:27.640
There's that, um, looking in our chat room, uh, SSU 100, Matt is actually asking a question

14:27.640 --> 14:33.680
of the chat with five years of having the switch has your console been docked or undocked

14:33.680 --> 14:34.680
most of the time.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.000
I think that's interesting.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.280
We have a few answers here.

14:37.280 --> 14:41.960
Uh, E3 VL says docked, except when I need to take a number two, thank you.

14:41.960 --> 14:46.040
Uh, I'm going to assume taking your S your second switch, we'll just leave it at that.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.040
Um, let's see.

14:47.040 --> 14:51.040
Uh, as Joe and Hunter, Matt says undocked, I only really have it docked when it's smash

14:51.040 --> 14:57.200
or Mario party, uh, for me docked 98% of the time.

14:57.200 --> 15:03.960
And the 2% is when I was traveling pre COVID going to things like, um, dragon con I'll

15:03.960 --> 15:09.160
take my switch to dragon con, but that's otherwise like most of my game, I love to play it on

15:09.160 --> 15:14.000
the plane, but otherwise most of my gaming is a absolutely docked mode.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.440
Uh, Bobby black Wolf says it was docked a hundred percent of the time until P cross

15:19.440 --> 15:20.760
came out.

15:20.760 --> 15:24.180
And now the switch lives next to my bed and you know, what's interesting.

15:24.180 --> 15:28.580
My husband, Alan finally bought a switch for animal crossing, but he bought that switch

15:28.580 --> 15:31.820
light, which can't even be docked.

15:31.820 --> 15:33.660
So for some people, it's not an option.

15:33.660 --> 15:36.580
If you bought a switch light, you don't have a dock.

15:36.580 --> 15:38.940
He can't even put his switch in my dock.

15:38.940 --> 15:40.420
It doesn't work that way.

15:40.420 --> 15:47.240
So that sounds like a thing that we don't need to hear about.

15:47.240 --> 15:53.940
All y'all need religion, Jesus, whatever, seek it anyway, I tried that whole Jesus thing.

15:53.940 --> 15:54.940
It didn't work out for me.

15:54.940 --> 15:59.620
I said, whatever, whatever is my all encompassing anyway.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.380
Um, yeah.

16:01.380 --> 16:04.220
Orange Wright says 99% of the time it's docked.

16:04.220 --> 16:05.420
Uh, yeah.

16:05.420 --> 16:11.660
So, so it is interesting that this year seems to be such a big year, but I also understand

16:11.660 --> 16:17.340
the skepticism that they're saying breath of the wild too, is going to be this year,

16:17.340 --> 16:22.420
but I'll believe it when I see it, we still don't even know the official name, but I bet

16:22.420 --> 16:23.420
we will get the name.

16:23.420 --> 16:29.940
We will get the name at I'm using quotey fingers E3 intent, which I think should really be

16:29.940 --> 16:33.240
called Nintendo's summer direct at this point.

16:33.240 --> 16:39.520
I don't think there is any really, um, w we'll just wait for the dice to fall and officially

16:39.520 --> 16:44.020
make that a reality, uh, or orange right says summer games Fest.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.020
Sure.

16:45.020 --> 16:46.020
Okay.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.020
Sure.

16:47.020 --> 16:50.380
If we, if we want to give Jeff's ego that, sure.

16:50.420 --> 16:52.300
Uh, Nintendo summer announcements.

16:52.300 --> 16:53.300
We'll see.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.300
All right.

16:54.300 --> 17:00.580
Um, I know we talk a lot about video games to escape, um, the realities of the real world,

17:00.580 --> 17:03.140
but, um, there's a lot of big shit going on in the real world.

17:03.140 --> 17:07.420
We talked a little bit about it last week and yes, it affects gaming and yes, gaming

17:07.420 --> 17:08.420
is involved.

17:08.420 --> 17:09.420
Dark soccer.

17:09.420 --> 17:15.380
I think you have a piece on the latest with, um, how, uh, Vladimir Putin's war is affecting

17:15.380 --> 17:16.380
the gaming industry.

17:16.380 --> 17:17.380
Right?

17:17.380 --> 17:18.380
Yeah.

17:18.380 --> 17:24.460
Um, basically everyone's like, fuck you, Russia, at least everyone with a conscience

17:24.460 --> 17:29.820
or at least a corporate conscience, I should say, um, and actually, can I quickly say hats

17:29.820 --> 17:37.220
off to the thousands of protesters in Russia speaking up against thousands of people were

17:37.220 --> 17:38.940
like detained in Russia today.

17:38.940 --> 17:44.180
So props to the people, um, cause I know there's many, many, many, many within Russia that,

17:44.180 --> 17:45.540
um, don't like it.

17:45.540 --> 17:49.900
Um, and props, props to people for being able to stay informed, even when they're really,

17:49.900 --> 17:52.540
really trying not to let you be anyway.

17:52.540 --> 17:53.540
Sorry.

17:53.540 --> 18:00.020
So basically though, we've had EA, um, pull their product from, uh, Russia.

18:00.020 --> 18:01.620
We've had CD project.

18:01.620 --> 18:07.620
It's based in Poland, even the makers of cyberpunk and the Witcher, uh, gaming franchise, uh,

18:07.620 --> 18:10.380
halt all of their sales in Russia and Belarus.

18:10.380 --> 18:14.220
Um, and all the sales through GOG in those countries.

18:14.220 --> 18:21.260
Um, also, uh, of course the, the, uh, Ukrainian president has, uh, or prime minister, I should

18:21.260 --> 18:30.300
say, has, uh, issued his own statement, um, where he's appealed to, uh, uh, different,

18:30.300 --> 18:36.900
uh, I'm going to say just different, uh, facilities in the democratic world.

18:37.140 --> 18:42.220
Um, in fact, one of the quotes on here says, I appeal to temporarily block all Russian

18:42.220 --> 18:47.020
and Belarusian accounts, temporarily stop the participation of Russia and Belarusian

18:47.020 --> 18:52.820
teams and gamers in all international esports events and cancel all international events

18:52.820 --> 18:58.660
holding the territory, uh, uh, I, it's the translation on here is a little funky, uh,

18:58.660 --> 19:02.100
holding in the territory of Russia and Belarus.

19:02.100 --> 19:06.140
We are sure that such actions will motivate the citizens of Russia to proactively stop

19:06.260 --> 19:09.180
the disgraceful, uh, disgraceful military aggression.

19:09.180 --> 19:11.980
Sorry, that's the deputy prime minister.

19:11.980 --> 19:20.100
Um, so yeah, um, on top of that too, now, uh, the, the first, uh, bit of information

19:20.100 --> 19:25.260
I found on it, uh, it was a little out of date as of the 6th, um, but various other

19:25.260 --> 19:32.500
companies have added their names to the list, uh, Apple has stopped selling, uh, uh, games

19:32.500 --> 19:38.900
on the app store, Apple maps is, uh, disabled for the safety of Ukrainian citizens, uh,

19:38.900 --> 19:39.900
in the Ukraine.

19:39.900 --> 19:47.220
Um, also Apple pay is limited in Russia, Microsoft, it has a suspended sales of its products and

19:47.220 --> 19:52.300
services and, uh, pumping up the cybersecurity in Ukraine.

19:52.300 --> 19:56.920
Google says that Russia can still use Google search engines, but they've suspended its

19:56.920 --> 19:58.740
advertising business.

19:58.740 --> 20:03.940
So that's all ad revenue for YouTube searching, other forms of Google sponsored marketing,

20:03.940 --> 20:09.580
um, and Google maps features have been disabled, um, although they are still providing info

20:09.580 --> 20:14.820
on refugee sources for people fleeing the Ukraine, Samsung has also suspended their

20:14.820 --> 20:22.160
shipments to Russia as of this past Friday, the 4th, um, TikTok, uh, is suspending live

20:22.160 --> 20:24.560
streaming and new content to Russia.

20:24.560 --> 20:31.720
Um, they are doing it because there are some, it's actually based on the fake news law in

20:31.720 --> 20:36.400
Russia saying that they need to make sure that the information that goes out is, is,

20:36.400 --> 20:38.880
isn't spreading misinformation.

20:38.880 --> 20:45.720
Snapchat is also, um, halted all ad sales, although the app will still remain for communication.

20:45.720 --> 20:50.720
Airbnb is offering temporary free housing to a hundred thousand Ukrainian refugees and

20:50.760 --> 20:54.120
waiving hosting guest fees for booking in Ukraine.

20:54.120 --> 21:01.360
Um, I've heard people here booking Airbnbs in Ukraine, they never intend to stay at because

21:01.360 --> 21:04.400
they're just trying to give money to people that need it.

21:04.400 --> 21:09.800
I thought that was a fascinating, uh, it's the paying, not staying is what it's called.

21:09.800 --> 21:10.800
Oh, okay.

21:10.800 --> 21:16.240
Uh, Disney is also halting all theatrical releases, uh, releases in Russia, including,

21:16.240 --> 21:19.000
uh, the Pixar film turning red.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.400
Sony has stopped, uh, theatrical releases in Russia.

21:22.400 --> 21:27.560
PlayStation 5 though is still on sale, um, and they are under a lot of pressure to stop

21:27.560 --> 21:29.400
sales of their gaming consoles.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.080
Uh, Warner Brothers is not releasing Batman.

21:32.080 --> 21:39.960
Uh, Paramount is halting all theatrical releases, including, uh, the Sonic sequel and Lost City.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.760
Universal is doing the same.

21:41.760 --> 21:47.860
Nintendo has placed, uh, its Russian eShop in maintenance mode, meaning it is unavailable

21:47.860 --> 21:50.580
and gamers are locked out of purchasing new games through the service.

21:50.580 --> 21:54.660
Uh, EA, like I said, has stopped selling in Russia and Belarus.

21:54.660 --> 22:00.300
Intel has suspended all shipments to customers in Russia, uh, in Belarus, including their

22:00.300 --> 22:01.300
chips.

22:01.300 --> 22:05.860
Uh, Netflix paused all projects and acquisitions in Russia and refused to run state run channels

22:05.860 --> 22:07.860
and on their service in Russia.

22:07.860 --> 22:12.620
Uh, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda scaled back all their operations as well.

22:12.620 --> 22:18.300
Uh, BMW stopped production in Kaliningrad and halt exports to Russia.

22:18.300 --> 22:23.940
Ford is stopping effective immediately, GM is as well, and Honda has also suspended their

22:23.940 --> 22:24.940
exports.

22:24.940 --> 22:29.420
So that's just the overall, like, list of companies that have come into it, not just

22:29.420 --> 22:35.780
our gaming system, gaming services, but we have, you know, and actually the, the good

22:35.780 --> 22:44.620
thing about, um, Google, um, you know, basically anything that offers, uh, mobile apps is that,

22:44.620 --> 22:50.260
um, that is the majority of the Russian gaming market is mobile apps and steam, uh, which

22:50.260 --> 22:53.540
I haven't seen anything though about valve yet.

22:53.540 --> 22:57.820
Um, as of the fourth, it looks like valve hadn't made a comment.

22:57.820 --> 23:00.340
There could be something since then, but I haven't seen it.

23:00.340 --> 23:05.380
Um, I actually do want to quickly go back to the Nintendo Sony thing because we do,

23:05.380 --> 23:10.340
you know, thanks to this show going worldwide, um, and we have folks that participate with

23:10.340 --> 23:11.340
the show.

23:11.340 --> 23:15.820
Um, if they're not here live, um, potentially in our discord server over at vog network.com

23:15.820 --> 23:20.340
slash discord, and we do have a listener who I know is in Russia, uh, who doesn't listen

23:20.340 --> 23:23.820
live probably because of the time zone difference, but listens on the podcast.

23:23.820 --> 23:27.620
And this listener is actually kind of giving us some insight as to what's going on over

23:27.620 --> 23:28.620
there.

23:28.620 --> 23:33.720
I'm commenting in our channel about the Nintendo eShop eShop in Russia was suspended, including

23:33.720 --> 23:38.880
the ability to patch the games and redownloading already owned content on the Sony thing, though,

23:38.880 --> 23:43.960
the, this was, this was interesting brand Turismo seven launch was canceled.

23:43.960 --> 23:48.640
Even people with pre-orders who were able to play immediately after launch got refunds

23:48.640 --> 23:50.800
and the game was removed from their libraries.

23:50.800 --> 23:54.360
So Sony is doing something, which is interesting.

23:54.360 --> 23:59.440
Um, I, I, and I don't know if I would have heard that outside of, um, somebody over there

23:59.440 --> 24:01.800
actually telling us, um, what's happening.

24:01.800 --> 24:06.880
So, and, uh, I'm, I'm confident this is one of those individuals to which I earlier spoke

24:06.880 --> 24:12.040
is informed exactly on what's going on and is not, you know, so it's, so thank you for

24:12.040 --> 24:15.080
keeping us in the loop of, uh, from your perspective, for sure.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.080
What's going on.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.080
Yeah.

24:17.080 --> 24:22.080
Uh, another comment, funnily enough today, all gaming platforms have effectively stopped

24:22.080 --> 24:24.480
all game sales due to payment providers.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.480
They all share.

24:25.480 --> 24:26.720
That's probably the mastercard visa thing.

24:26.720 --> 24:31.720
Uh, GOG had a workaround as they always supported payments using USD, but they explicitly

24:31.720 --> 24:33.960
disabled all sales.

24:33.960 --> 24:39.520
So, and I I'm assuming a lot of that, like you might be wondering, what are they trying

24:39.520 --> 24:40.520
to do?

24:40.520 --> 24:43.760
Are they trying to just make things miserable in Russia?

24:43.760 --> 24:45.640
And part of that is, yes, they are.

24:45.640 --> 24:50.620
Um, and it's, it's to try to, you know, because obviously we know there's a lot of disinformation

24:50.620 --> 24:52.040
going on.

24:52.040 --> 24:57.860
Um, which by the way, as an interesting side effect of this, I don't, has anyone else noticed?

24:57.860 --> 25:02.220
And maybe this is, I'm fully willing to admit, maybe this is just confirmation bias and like

25:02.220 --> 25:07.100
when you, when you want to see something, you see it, but it feels like social media

25:07.100 --> 25:09.120
has had a lot less bullshit on it.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.860
Like the last two weeks, I'm not saying it's bullshit free.

25:11.860 --> 25:16.000
There's still lots of bullshit, but I feel like if you look at the replies to like a

25:16.000 --> 25:22.220
post from a politician or a celebrity, you're not seeing the same stuff at the top.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.220
And I think that's very interesting.

25:24.780 --> 25:26.740
Just, just throwing it out there.

25:26.740 --> 25:27.740
Very interesting.

25:27.740 --> 25:34.400
Um, so, and again, I have no facts to back that up, just my personal observation, which

25:34.400 --> 25:38.500
doesn't mean shit at the end of the day, but I have a microphone and I said, say things

25:38.500 --> 25:39.500
into it.

25:39.500 --> 25:47.180
Um, but anyway, the disinformation that goes on there, yes, the, the Sony, the, the MasterCard

25:47.180 --> 25:52.700
visa sales, stop the, all this stuff is going on to try to basically alert the population.

25:53.700 --> 25:59.500
The rest of the world, essentially, not, not completely, but a good majority of the rest

25:59.500 --> 26:07.260
of the world is United and that Vladimir Putin, who is the leader of Russia, is the aggressor

26:07.260 --> 26:08.260
in this circumstance.

26:08.260 --> 26:12.700
And as the person, and as, um, you, you put it a very eloquent way, Jamie last week, and

26:12.700 --> 26:16.620
maybe you took it from somewhere, I don't know, but you said something about like, Ukraine

26:16.620 --> 26:17.900
cannot stop the war.

26:17.900 --> 26:20.300
If Ukraine stops the war, they lose.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.700
Vladimir Putin can stop the war whenever he wants.

26:23.700 --> 26:24.700
Exactly.

26:24.700 --> 26:30.980
If, if basically it, it was from a sign, a protest sign that if Russia stops the, stops

26:30.980 --> 26:35.820
the war, then everything is fine.

26:35.820 --> 26:43.420
I mean, if Ukraine stops fighting, there's no more Ukraine.

26:43.420 --> 26:49.000
So anyhow, um, our hearts continue to go out to the Ukrainian people and, um, just so,

26:49.000 --> 26:54.280
so many people fleeing the country and, uh, having their lives uprooted and changed.

26:54.280 --> 27:01.280
You know, we talked last week about people, the world is a lot smaller because of podcasts,

27:01.280 --> 27:05.400
because of streaming, because of social media, because of all these technological things

27:05.400 --> 27:11.180
we have now, you know, there was a day and age where I couldn't get text updates from

27:11.180 --> 27:14.620
somebody in Russia about what's going on over there.

27:14.620 --> 27:18.040
That couldn't, you guys are kind of talking about the cold war.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.640
That, that couldn't have happened in the eighties.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.360
We didn't get that.

27:22.360 --> 27:26.000
But now technology makes this world a lot smaller.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Sure does.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Yeah.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Anyway.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Yeah.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.720
We didn't have our, you know, we barely had what the BBS is and things like that and,

27:34.720 --> 27:35.720
you know,

27:35.720 --> 27:36.720
um,

27:36.720 --> 27:44.080
Misha and chat asking a question that is a little off topic, but I think is important

27:44.080 --> 27:45.080
to address.

27:45.120 --> 27:49.000
I am going to this, this question may be, um, difficult, but please let me get through

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
this.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
And then I'll, I'll explain.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.100
Uh, Misha says, so I have a legit question and this is nothing against the president

27:56.100 --> 28:00.480
of Russia, but what would happen if you were assassinated?

28:00.480 --> 28:03.200
Is it the same as here or is it totally different?

28:03.200 --> 28:07.960
Again, I'm only asking, cause I don't know, um, that is a difficult question and it's

28:07.960 --> 28:08.960
one of those.

28:08.960 --> 28:13.800
And I want to stress that is not something I am endorsing or advocate because we had

28:13.800 --> 28:20.520
a Senator who put his foot in his mouth as he often does, suggesting this should happen.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.360
And this is only hypotheticals.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.360
Yes.

28:23.360 --> 28:28.040
I want to, I want to stress that, but I think there are a lot of people, I think we can,

28:28.040 --> 28:32.720
who openly wonder and I don't, I don't think there's anything wrong Misha don't apologize.

28:32.720 --> 28:37.840
You're, you're vocalizing what a lot of people are thinking, but no, they can't say the quiet

28:37.840 --> 28:40.680
part out loud.

28:40.680 --> 28:41.680
Nothing wrong with that.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.560
Saying the quiet part out loud and that's fine.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.560
What happens?

28:45.560 --> 28:49.480
I'm going to admit, I don't know politically if it's like a succession thing, but I would

28:49.480 --> 28:56.280
assume he is replaced with somebody who believes the same things he does.

28:56.280 --> 28:59.720
It doesn't just magically turn around, right?

28:59.720 --> 29:04.280
It's going to be somebody who learns from him.

29:04.280 --> 29:12.120
There's a historical precedence of it though in, in Russia because it's basically all just

29:12.120 --> 29:17.480
like political popularity contests after Lenin died, Stalin, no one really thought that Stalin

29:17.480 --> 29:22.920
would be the one to take over as far as I recall, yet things in Russia, things were

29:22.920 --> 29:23.920
okay with Lenin.

29:23.920 --> 29:29.600
I mean, I'm not saying they were great, you know, but in relatively to Stalin, they were,

29:29.600 --> 29:30.600
they were okay.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.720
When Stalin came in, things really went to shit.

29:33.720 --> 29:41.240
So they have a massive history of assassinations, corruption, of letting the people suffer on

29:41.240 --> 29:45.200
the behalf of a chosen few.

29:45.200 --> 29:50.200
It's really just modern.

29:50.200 --> 29:54.520
It's just almost as bad as, as you know, what they thought they were overthrowing with SARS,

29:54.520 --> 29:56.680
you know?

29:56.680 --> 29:57.680
I think so.

29:57.680 --> 30:00.160
I think the short answer to the question, because I know we want to get back into video

30:00.160 --> 30:07.000
games, but the short answer to the question I think is whatever happens in that scenario,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.060
it wouldn't be good.

30:09.060 --> 30:14.660
And I think especially the way people imagine it playing out, like, you know, a mystery

30:14.660 --> 30:19.760
person within Russia does the deed or something and that, you know what, the situation's not

30:19.760 --> 30:20.760
going to get better.

30:20.760 --> 30:24.800
In fact, it'll probably get worse because then there'll be a lot of finger pointing

30:24.800 --> 30:29.700
and blaming about what foreign power was behind the whole thing.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.820
And I think things don't get better, things get worse.

30:32.820 --> 30:35.860
So we should actually hope that doesn't happen.

30:35.860 --> 30:42.260
And that instead of Vladimir Putin kind of is faced with the reality that he's not going

30:42.260 --> 30:44.740
to get what he wants in this scenario.

30:44.740 --> 30:52.580
And in fact, the only way his people are going to get the nice things back is for this to

30:52.580 --> 30:53.580
end.

30:53.580 --> 30:56.500
And again, only Russia can put an end to themselves.

30:56.820 --> 31:02.140
I think that Russia runs into a very similar problem that I think that the United States

31:02.140 --> 31:10.540
has in the fact that it's a very large area for one government to control.

31:10.540 --> 31:19.820
I mean, the bigger it gets, the worse off corruption becomes.

31:19.820 --> 31:23.820
If you look at Iceland, when they had their political revolution, it was pretty easy for

31:23.820 --> 31:24.820
them.

31:24.820 --> 31:25.820
They were a small country.

31:25.820 --> 31:31.740
You know, their making decisions for a smaller population was one thing.

31:31.740 --> 31:36.280
And there's people who are talking about like full on revolution in Russia.

31:36.280 --> 31:41.260
But they have the same problem that we would have here is that it's too big, too many people,

31:41.260 --> 31:43.860
too many laws, too many established.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.860
America was damaged from the conception.

31:45.860 --> 31:48.260
I'm just going to say that right now.

31:48.260 --> 31:54.860
Russia has kind of fallen, well, not kind of, has fallen that route for centuries.

31:54.900 --> 31:57.900
So just saying, a little history lesson.

31:57.900 --> 32:05.260
All right, let's go, even though the real world is important, I know this also is escapism

32:05.260 --> 32:06.260
for some people.

32:06.260 --> 32:10.040
So let's go back to video games and talk about our gaming week and the types of video games

32:10.040 --> 32:11.820
that we have been playing this week.

32:11.820 --> 32:13.060
So Dark Sakura, we'll go to you.

32:13.060 --> 32:15.620
How was your gaming week?

32:15.620 --> 32:17.080
Kind of busy.

32:17.080 --> 32:23.140
So I finished Legend of Zelda Link to the Past, which was awesome.

32:23.140 --> 32:29.900
My new retro night is started with Chrono Trigger last night, of which I am still cheating

32:29.900 --> 32:33.020
my way through because I have beaten that game so many freaking times.

32:33.020 --> 32:34.460
I have gotten most of the endings.

32:34.460 --> 32:36.260
I think we have 12 of the 14.

32:36.260 --> 32:40.920
Wait, I have to remember which one were the cartridge ones and which ones were not.

32:40.920 --> 32:44.540
But I've got most, we've done pretty much almost all the cartridge ones between me and

32:44.540 --> 32:46.580
Dan.

32:46.580 --> 32:49.860
So I've been playing, so I started that.

32:49.860 --> 32:53.340
We got to Right Before You Get Robo.

32:53.340 --> 32:56.780
So that's pretty cool.

32:56.780 --> 33:02.400
I've also learned that there is a particular cheat that totally makes the game break.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.460
And it's actually kind of hilarious.

33:04.460 --> 33:07.700
So I'm not doing that one anymore.

33:07.700 --> 33:13.300
I love, when I had my Super Nintendo back in the day, well, I mean, I still have one,

33:13.300 --> 33:19.820
but back then, what I used to do would be to put in just random codes and see if I could

33:19.820 --> 33:23.840
break my games, and I did some very interesting ones.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.460
It was pretty neat.

33:25.460 --> 33:29.260
So I like to do the same thing now.

33:29.260 --> 33:34.540
At any rate, though, that's the retro gaming side of it.

33:34.540 --> 33:38.980
I didn't play Fantasian this week because I'm in that spot, and I got the same place

33:38.980 --> 33:47.900
as a lot of RPGs where I am under-leveled for the boss fights.

33:47.900 --> 33:52.620
And I realized that I will need another five to six levels to be effective at the boss

33:52.620 --> 33:53.620
fights.

33:53.620 --> 33:58.400
This is the complaint I have about Fantasian, and I'm not the only one, is that their

33:58.400 --> 34:05.580
boss fights say, well, to do the area, it says you need to be level 43, suggested level

34:05.580 --> 34:07.540
43, something like that.

34:07.540 --> 34:12.680
I go in at 45 and get to the boss.

34:12.680 --> 34:16.480
By the time I get to the boss, I'm 46, and it still hands me my ass.

34:16.480 --> 34:20.800
And then I go look at, oh, for this guide, it's said to be 43, but I did this at level

34:20.800 --> 34:27.680
57, and blah, blah, blah, like, okay, game, sure.

34:27.680 --> 34:31.200
So I'm going to have to do a bunch of grinding, and I hate grinding.

34:31.200 --> 34:39.000
I mean, I may as well just have a just chatting stream while I grind, because nothing interesting

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
is going to happen.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.240
Still playing Dead by Daylight.

34:43.240 --> 34:44.680
I got another Adept.

34:44.680 --> 34:46.400
I got Pyramid Head.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.720
Thank you.

34:48.720 --> 34:49.720
You know, it's so funny.

34:49.720 --> 34:54.000
I never played him a lot, and then I said, okay, well, I'm picking someone I have to

34:54.000 --> 34:58.680
Adept and just playing them until I'm done with them.

34:58.680 --> 35:04.240
And by the time I finally get the hang of Pyramid Head, I Adepted him, and I'm like,

35:04.240 --> 35:05.240
okay, I'm done.

35:05.240 --> 35:13.840
So now I'm moving on to Spirit, and it's embarrassing, I won't say any more.

35:13.880 --> 35:17.760
So Spirit is my main killer, probably, more than anyone.

35:17.760 --> 35:22.840
It's the only one I feel like I can do well with is Spirit.

35:22.840 --> 35:26.000
I issue you a challenge then, Rob.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.840
M1 Triss.

35:28.840 --> 35:29.840
Take the Eerie Hatchet.

35:29.840 --> 35:30.840
Take her two Eries.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.840
Oh, I'm terrible with Huntress.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.320
No, no, no, no.

35:34.320 --> 35:35.320
Listen to me.

35:35.320 --> 35:37.440
Listen to me.

35:37.440 --> 35:41.640
Take the Eerie Hatchet and throw it, and then don't refill your hatchet, so you will get

35:41.640 --> 35:49.640
like one and a half additional movement speed, and then just M1 everybody.

35:49.640 --> 35:50.640
No one will expect it.

35:50.640 --> 35:51.640
It's hilarious.

35:51.640 --> 35:57.280
I saw Nick or one of the killer streamers I watched do a build like that.

35:57.280 --> 36:01.280
It was a build for that actually might have been LC.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.240
I did that.

36:03.240 --> 36:04.640
So I had a challenge.

36:04.640 --> 36:18.400
It was on one of the Tome thing where you had to hit people 10 times with just a regular

36:18.400 --> 36:19.400
attack as Huntress.

36:19.400 --> 36:23.840
It was called like old school or something or original or something like that.

36:23.840 --> 36:30.360
So I did it in combination with my Adept attempt, and I got it.

36:30.360 --> 36:33.640
And every time I have played Huntress ever since, it's been M1 Huntress.

36:33.640 --> 36:38.520
It has been hilarious because no one expects it to try some time.

36:38.520 --> 36:44.720
It's pretty fun, but that being said, I also got Pig to P350 finally, and I'm just saving

36:44.720 --> 36:50.160
up all my blood points for Sadako coming out on the 8th, which also means nurse returns

36:50.160 --> 36:56.080
on the 8th, and I'm going to try to learn nurse.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.080
Pray for me.

36:58.080 --> 37:01.040
I'm really excited to play the Ringu content.

37:01.040 --> 37:05.440
I think Sadako is going to be a great killer.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.440
And she's short, though.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.320
I'll be happy with her because she's short.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.420
My problem with Pyramid Head is he's tall.

37:11.420 --> 37:15.040
Same problem I have with Plague, even though it was a plague forever.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.560
The shorter characters, I have an easier time playing.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.800
It just feels like a more natural line of sight.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.160
Even Freddy is relatively short.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.280
Just a more natural line of sight for me.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.280
Right.

37:25.280 --> 37:31.960
Oh, and Wordscapes, because I always freaking play Wordscapes.

37:31.960 --> 37:41.800
Also I started playing through Dracula X Rondo of Blood, and I'm planning on doing my embarrassing

37:41.800 --> 37:45.560
attempt at Radiant Silver Gun just randomly one day this week.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.000
All right.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Sounds fun, Action Pat.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.760
You've been doing a lot more streaming lately.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.960
I think since your work schedule changed, you're streaming five days a week from now.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.680
I see you all the time.

37:56.680 --> 38:03.240
I try to do streams when you're not streaming, but there's no time when you're not streaming.

38:03.240 --> 38:08.680
Well, I stream five days a week.

38:08.680 --> 38:09.680
That's great.

38:09.680 --> 38:10.680
That's good.

38:10.680 --> 38:11.680
You just have to keep at it.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.680
Awesome.

38:12.680 --> 38:13.680
All right.

38:13.680 --> 38:19.360
Well, that's the thing is that I'm trying to be consistent and trying to do more time.

38:19.360 --> 38:20.760
I have a good time doing it, though.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.400
I'm really feel like...

38:22.400 --> 38:23.400
Good.

38:23.840 --> 38:24.840
I'm finding my voice.

38:24.840 --> 38:25.840
Good.

38:26.840 --> 38:27.840
That's good.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.840
All right.

38:28.840 --> 38:29.840
Let's go over to...

38:29.840 --> 38:34.840
I'll just quickly say, I see Sacred Jade in chat saying my voice audio is a bit quiet.

38:34.840 --> 38:35.840
Sorry about that.

38:35.840 --> 38:39.160
Again, the audio's changed a bit, trying to get used to it.

38:39.160 --> 38:43.280
I may need to adjust my code, may not, because I can't make any further adjustments to get

38:43.280 --> 38:44.280
me louder.

38:44.280 --> 38:48.560
I may need to make my cohost a little softer, and I'll try that.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.280
So we'll see how that goes.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.880
But let me ask Loki, how was your gaming week?

38:53.360 --> 38:55.360
It was all Minecraft again.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.360
I know.

38:56.360 --> 38:57.360
I think there's a problem with that.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.360
It's a shock.

38:58.360 --> 39:04.560
Yeah, I've been going between my new hardcore series, which I've been playing quite a bit

39:04.560 --> 39:08.200
in, but I didn't really live stream too much.

39:08.200 --> 39:12.520
I actually restarted from the last time I live streamed it, because before, when I live

39:12.520 --> 39:17.040
streamed it last, I didn't have all the shaders and everything working well with it.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.840
Plus the seed was kind of boring.

39:18.840 --> 39:22.160
So I started a new seed, and I have all my shaders and everything.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.760
It looks super nice now.

39:24.760 --> 39:27.880
So I've got that going for me.

39:27.880 --> 39:31.420
So I'm actually working on editing that first episode for that.

39:31.420 --> 39:37.300
And then I designed a new thing for NerdCraft as well.

39:37.300 --> 39:43.720
And so I've been gathering resources for that, which has been kind of grindy.

39:43.720 --> 39:44.720
Lots of copper.

39:44.720 --> 39:47.760
It takes a long time to get that and oxidize it and all that stuff.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.000
So that's been my week mostly.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.040
And of course, HermitCraft season nine launched today, so I've been watching their content

39:54.040 --> 39:55.040
and everything for that.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.040
Nice.

39:56.040 --> 39:59.480
But yeah, that's pretty much all I've been doing.

39:59.480 --> 40:00.480
Okay.

40:00.480 --> 40:01.480
Let's see, my gaming week.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.400
A little slower than my usual gaming weeks.

40:03.400 --> 40:07.220
I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, a little killer, a little survivor,

40:07.220 --> 40:08.800
playing that as well.

40:08.800 --> 40:15.080
I started streaming again on my personal channel, twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, cheap plug.

40:15.080 --> 40:19.920
But I started streaming No Man's Sky, because that fifth expedition came out the week that

40:19.920 --> 40:22.240
I was moving and I was like, Ooh, I want to get into that.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.240
I want to play that.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.240
I want to stream that.

40:24.240 --> 40:29.200
So I did start playing that on stream and I got through phase one and I only have like

40:29.200 --> 40:32.600
one more task to do on phase two, two more tasks to do on phase two.

40:32.600 --> 40:36.720
I'm really close to being done with one, but I'm making good progress on the expedition

40:36.720 --> 40:38.440
and I'm enjoying that.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.600
I just need to do some more streams with it.

40:40.600 --> 40:44.160
I haven't played any off stream, so I need to work on that.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.840
So I'll probably do that throughout the week next week.

40:45.840 --> 40:50.200
I'm just not sure what days yet, because I'm, I'm prepping for a performance at the

40:50.200 --> 40:51.940
end of the month here.

40:51.940 --> 40:55.520
Just a local shout out, actually, I should, I should give plugs to two local shows.

40:55.520 --> 41:02.640
So if you're based in the Sacramento area this Saturday, a really cool March 12th, John

41:02.640 --> 41:09.080
Waters, the infamous movie director of movies like Hairspray, Serial Mom, Cry Baby, Pink

41:09.080 --> 41:10.080
Flingos.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.080
Cry Baby.

41:11.080 --> 41:17.440
I'm also going to be doing a talk called Faults Negative at the Colonial Theater on March

41:17.440 --> 41:19.560
12th, Saturday.

41:19.560 --> 41:25.920
So I, and I am fortunate enough, I'm going to be introducing him and I'm also going to,

41:25.920 --> 41:32.120
so after he's done, we're also having a drag invitational of some drag kings, drag queens,

41:32.120 --> 41:33.740
non-binary royalty.

41:33.740 --> 41:37.640
And I am hosting that as well, which is an honor to do.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.300
So yeah, so that's exciting.

41:39.300 --> 41:42.860
So I have that show to worry about, but then also so shout out if you're in the area, come

41:42.860 --> 41:43.860
on out.

41:43.860 --> 41:50.980
But on March 26th, so that's in three weeks, we're doing Clue the movie, but we're doing

41:50.980 --> 41:53.020
it Rocky horror style.

41:53.020 --> 41:56.540
So meaning we are performing the movie as the movie plays.

41:56.540 --> 41:58.980
So we're performing the movie on a stage as a stage plays.

41:58.980 --> 42:00.300
So I am in the cast.

42:00.300 --> 42:03.540
I am playing, my role is a secret.

42:03.540 --> 42:06.140
I am not disclosing the role that I'm playing.

42:06.180 --> 42:13.100
So you have to come see it to find out, but it's, it's going to be hilarious.

42:13.100 --> 42:14.560
The show is so good.

42:14.560 --> 42:19.960
Like I died laughing today during rehearsal, I'll tell you who I'm not playing.

42:19.960 --> 42:24.120
I'm not playing the singing telegram girl, but I know who is.

42:24.120 --> 42:26.420
And I saw that whole scene and I died.

42:26.420 --> 42:27.420
It was so good.

42:27.420 --> 42:28.980
So it's, it'll be fun.

42:28.980 --> 42:33.820
But the other, the other fun twist about Clue, we actually have Leslie Ann Warren who played

42:33.820 --> 42:37.740
Ms. Scarlet in the movie, a last minute replacement for Carrie Fisher.

42:37.740 --> 42:41.940
Fun fact, Carrie Fisher was supposed to be in Scarlet and dropped out to go to rehab.

42:41.940 --> 42:44.320
And that's where, that's why we got postcards from the edge.

42:44.320 --> 42:48.180
But anyway, Leslie Ann Warren is actually going to be there in person.

42:48.180 --> 42:49.380
So that's really cool.

42:49.380 --> 42:50.380
Yeah.

42:50.380 --> 42:51.380
So.

42:51.380 --> 42:53.380
So you're going to be playing Ms. Scarlet?

42:53.380 --> 42:58.600
No, but, but imagine the person who's playing Ms. Scarlet, very lucky to be doing that in

42:58.600 --> 42:59.860
front of Leslie Ann Warren.

42:59.860 --> 43:05.500
So also, I was also not me, but I know who's doing it and she's great.

43:05.500 --> 43:06.500
Yeah.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.500
It's going to be great.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.500
So gracious.

43:08.500 --> 43:11.980
So anyway, I, I cheap plugs for those here locally, but also just like if my gaming weeks

43:11.980 --> 43:15.420
seem a little thin, I'm trying to throw a costume together.

43:15.420 --> 43:16.940
I'm in rehearsals.

43:16.940 --> 43:22.820
There's a lot going on for both those shows, but it's nice to have stuff coming back again.

43:22.820 --> 43:25.100
This is a huge year for the, in the shows department.

43:25.100 --> 43:28.420
I just, at the end of April, see Dark Soccer, you went like this.

43:29.060 --> 43:32.620
We're not doing any celebrities or anything super fun, but I'm going to still host it.

43:32.620 --> 43:38.700
We're doing a goth night out where we're doing a nineties goth double feature of The Crow

43:38.700 --> 43:39.700
and The Craft.

43:39.700 --> 43:40.700
Double feature.

43:40.700 --> 43:42.660
The Craft wasn't nineties though.

43:42.660 --> 43:43.660
Yeah, it was.

43:43.660 --> 43:44.660
98 to 99.

43:44.660 --> 43:46.540
It was towards the end.

43:46.540 --> 43:47.540
It was?

43:47.540 --> 43:48.540
Yeah, it was.

43:48.540 --> 43:49.540
Oh my God.

43:49.540 --> 43:50.540
I thought it was like early 2000s.

43:50.540 --> 43:51.540
So yeah.

43:51.540 --> 43:52.540
Wow.

43:52.540 --> 43:53.540
It was like my last year of high school.

43:53.540 --> 43:54.540
First year of college.

43:54.540 --> 43:55.540
Yeah.

43:55.540 --> 43:56.540
So.

43:56.540 --> 43:57.540
Well, I was.

43:57.660 --> 43:58.660
That's right.

43:58.660 --> 43:59.660
I saw it.

43:59.660 --> 44:05.820
And I saw when I was, no, I saw it out here because I had moved out here by then.

44:05.820 --> 44:08.660
So to be fair, they're only calling it goth night out.

44:08.660 --> 44:13.100
I'm calling it nineties goth night out because with those movies, that's what it feels like.

44:13.100 --> 44:15.980
Mike Deft quick on the Wiki says 96.

44:15.980 --> 44:16.980
So yeah.

44:16.980 --> 44:17.980
Yeah.

44:17.980 --> 44:18.980
Then I wasn't out here then.

44:18.980 --> 44:20.900
I saw it in Alabama.

44:20.900 --> 44:25.060
They just teased on, I don't think I'm doing anything with this show, but because I love

44:25.060 --> 44:27.120
SAC horror, I'll give him a shout out.

44:27.120 --> 44:30.000
They just announced on Ash Wednesday.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.940
They have Bruce Campbell coming in August and that'll be a really, I don't know what

44:33.940 --> 44:36.680
they're doing with him, but he's going to be here in August.

44:36.680 --> 44:40.020
So that's really exciting anyway.

44:40.020 --> 44:42.860
Love horror events.com if you're willing to check that out.

44:42.860 --> 44:43.860
Anyway.

44:43.860 --> 44:44.860
All right.

44:44.860 --> 44:45.860
So back to my gaming week.

44:45.860 --> 44:50.780
I've also been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy 14, but I'm going to admit I'm kind

44:50.780 --> 44:53.940
of, I'm kind of out of things to do in 14 right now.

44:53.940 --> 44:55.760
I'm really waiting for that content patch.

44:55.760 --> 44:59.820
I really enjoyed the live letter and a lot of stuff coming soon sounds, but I'm just,

44:59.820 --> 45:04.420
I'm sick of the expert roulette and there's really nothing else for me to do in the game

45:04.420 --> 45:05.420
regularly right now.

45:05.420 --> 45:09.860
So I'm, I'm kind of in a waiting period on that with Final Fantasy 14.

45:09.860 --> 45:14.460
So, and that's, that's honestly, let's see what else I feel like I went back and I played

45:14.460 --> 45:17.380
something else on steam this week.

45:17.380 --> 45:21.060
Oh, well I, Oh, I know what I played.

45:21.060 --> 45:26.760
It wasn't on steam, but because I don't have a bandwidth cap anymore, you all might remember

45:26.760 --> 45:32.300
when I switched, uh, locations, I switched internet providers and I have fiber internet

45:32.300 --> 45:35.100
now with no bandwidth cap.

45:35.100 --> 45:37.400
And so somebody said, Oh, rub.

45:37.400 --> 45:40.260
So you can re download Microsoft flight simulator, right?

45:40.260 --> 45:42.180
And I said, God damn it.

45:42.180 --> 45:43.180
You're right.

45:43.180 --> 45:45.460
I can re download Microsoft flight simulator.

45:45.460 --> 45:54.940
So I played flight simulator on, on Xbox one this week after downloading 140 gigabytes,

45:54.940 --> 46:01.240
140 gigabytes, but I don't care anymore.

46:01.240 --> 46:02.740
So it's great.

46:02.740 --> 46:05.920
And it is on a flight simulator is on Microsoft cloud services.

46:05.920 --> 46:11.240
Now if you want to, you know, if 140 gigs is a lot for you, uh, the cloud might, might

46:11.240 --> 46:12.240
be better.

46:12.240 --> 46:14.300
Uh, tiger class says, how long did it take?

46:14.300 --> 46:15.980
I ran it overnight.

46:15.980 --> 46:21.700
So I don't know, because not only was I downloading that, I queued up every single update that

46:21.700 --> 46:27.540
was overdue on Xbox series X, which was a lot because I, I, I queued up everything and

46:27.540 --> 46:31.780
I was like, I will run this overnight and tomorrow I'll have everything updated.

46:31.780 --> 46:36.200
And sure enough, the next day after work, everything's there ready to go.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.200
And it was, it was lovely.

46:37.200 --> 46:40.940
So, uh, yeah, so I've been playing Microsoft flight simulator.

46:40.940 --> 46:48.300
And the, the first thing that I did was I crashed into my new house, except, well, except

46:48.300 --> 46:51.800
cause you know, in flight simulator, you, you have the real world, right?

46:51.800 --> 46:57.580
So I crashed the plane in my new house, except my new house doesn't exist in flight simulator.

46:57.580 --> 46:59.740
It's a, it's still empty land.

46:59.740 --> 47:04.940
All right, anyhow, uh, let's move on.

47:04.940 --> 47:08.100
Let's get into some news, uh, that happened throughout the week.

47:08.260 --> 47:14.420
Uh, it not a busy news week, but a few headlines here and there we're talking about, uh, Loki,

47:14.420 --> 47:15.420
we'll start with you tonight.

47:15.420 --> 47:16.420
Yeah.

47:16.420 --> 47:21.780
So, um, some good news, at least it sounds like that the steam deck, if you want one

47:21.780 --> 47:25.660
of those, and, um, that did recently come out and a lot of people really liking what

47:25.660 --> 47:27.060
they're seeing so far.

47:27.060 --> 47:32.300
Um, if you're interested in one and weren't able to get in on those pre-orders right away,

47:32.300 --> 47:36.240
well, you'll be happy to know that they're ramping up their production, um, supposedly

47:36.240 --> 47:42.720
going to hit a hundred thousands of units per month, starting, uh, with April.

47:42.720 --> 47:48.720
Um, so that's pretty awesome that they'll be able to produce, or I'm sorry, actually

47:48.720 --> 47:52.680
maybe not per month, but they're going to be up to hundreds of thousands of scene decks,

47:52.680 --> 47:55.400
um, that'll been produced by April.

47:55.400 --> 48:00.780
Um, but they're accelerating their production, which is the point in the first place.

48:00.780 --> 48:04.560
And at least now, if you want to order it, you can, but you'll just be, you know, at

48:04.560 --> 48:09.920
the back of the line and want the weight for it to come out, but at least it's not

48:09.920 --> 48:10.920
hopeless.

48:10.920 --> 48:11.920
Yeah.

48:11.920 --> 48:16.240
I'm here sooner than other systems that are still not out yet.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.920
I'm hearing mixed, mostly positive on steam deck.

48:18.920 --> 48:24.040
I feel like some, some of it sounds like it's a little clunky in parts, but like when it

48:24.040 --> 48:28.640
works, it works really well is kind of, I think a lot of it is kind of early, like some

48:28.640 --> 48:33.960
of the software stuff still needs to be kind of updated and everything, but they're working

48:33.960 --> 48:38.040
on dressing that stuff, but hardware wise, I think it's been pretty good.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.040
Yeah.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.440
I, I definitely, I'm curious about it.

48:40.440 --> 48:44.520
I want to see, I want to play a friend's steam deck and I also kind of want to see if maybe

48:44.520 --> 48:50.160
they end up doing a steam deck refresh in a year or so that maybe has slightly beefier

48:50.160 --> 48:51.160
hardware.

48:51.160 --> 48:54.280
And that might be something I'd be interested in at that time, sort of like after they get

48:54.280 --> 48:59.000
past like, okay, this thing is a success where like, what were those computers they were

48:59.000 --> 49:01.320
building for a while called those kind of flopped?

49:01.320 --> 49:07.400
What were those steam hardware or something like that?

49:07.400 --> 49:08.400
Right.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.880
It was like the steam PC, the thing.

49:10.880 --> 49:11.880
Yeah.

49:11.880 --> 49:12.880
Steam PCs or something.

49:12.880 --> 49:13.880
You remember that?

49:13.880 --> 49:14.880
Yeah.

49:14.880 --> 49:15.880
Steam machines.

49:15.880 --> 49:16.880
That's it.

49:16.880 --> 49:17.880
That's it.

49:17.880 --> 49:18.880
I still have my steam link.

49:18.880 --> 49:19.880
Those kinds.

49:19.880 --> 49:20.880
Yeah.

49:20.880 --> 49:21.880
The steam link was all right.

49:21.880 --> 49:26.480
Like I, I found my steam controller too, while we were moving and I'd thrown it in a box at

49:26.480 --> 49:27.480
some point anyway.

49:27.480 --> 49:32.520
Um, but yeah, I'm, I'd be curious about the steam deck, but because it's, especially if

49:32.520 --> 49:36.560
these things start to take off in a way that the steam machines didn't, then they probably

49:36.560 --> 49:38.960
will refresh them, make better ones and so forth.

49:38.960 --> 49:41.080
A little later on down the line.

49:41.080 --> 49:45.160
It's interesting to think those steam machines, as much as I, it sounds like I'm talking shit

49:45.160 --> 49:46.160
about them right now.

49:46.160 --> 49:51.740
I'm not because I sort of think this is the evolution of those is they really took a look

49:51.740 --> 49:55.840
at how do we get hardware that people want?

49:55.840 --> 50:00.400
And I think valve looked at what Nintendo was doing and was like, Oh, we could do that.

50:00.400 --> 50:01.580
The steam machine.

50:01.580 --> 50:06.200
So we're more of like, it's just, this is like a PC specification that you're like,

50:06.200 --> 50:09.400
we're going to just basically have anybody can build these.

50:09.400 --> 50:11.000
And then we're going to throw Linux on there.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.240
Whereas this, the steam deck is like, it's a set piece of hardware.

50:14.240 --> 50:17.800
You know what the specs are games either run or they don't run on it.

50:17.800 --> 50:21.880
It's not going to be like, well, it's kind of like the difference between like, you know,

50:21.880 --> 50:28.720
games made for iOS and games made for Android, whereas iOS, you have certain phones and devices,

50:28.720 --> 50:32.720
you know, the specs for Android is just like, it's a wild west out there.

50:32.720 --> 50:36.480
Like there's phones all over the place and all sorts of different ranges and resolutions

50:36.480 --> 50:37.480
and whatnot.

50:37.480 --> 50:41.240
And so it's hard to like, be able to say, yeah, this will definitely run.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.480
This will not run, you know, whatnot.

50:43.480 --> 50:46.640
So I think the steam deck is definitely the step in the right direction.

50:46.640 --> 50:49.300
If they want to do like a console version of that.

50:49.300 --> 50:51.720
I'm all down for that as well.

50:51.720 --> 50:54.480
I am, you know, a quick aside on the steam deck.

50:54.480 --> 50:58.920
One thing I am hearing it does very well is emulation.

50:58.920 --> 51:04.260
Certainly the classics you know, and again, I don't advocate piracy, however, especially

51:04.260 --> 51:10.200
in Nintendo's case when you know, it's, it's, we know they're not very good at embracing

51:10.200 --> 51:11.200
the old library.

51:11.200 --> 51:16.720
I mean, we have some first party and second party stuff on the Netflix style library,

51:16.720 --> 51:20.240
but there's certainly so many games like the guardian legend, right?

51:20.240 --> 51:23.960
Our holy grail here at OLR, the guardian legend has never seen the light of day on virtual

51:23.960 --> 51:26.920
console or any of that stuff because of rights issues.

51:26.920 --> 51:29.600
So the only way to play it is to emulate it.

51:29.600 --> 51:33.360
So it sounds like the steam deck does those very well, but it also sounds like the steam

51:33.360 --> 51:37.840
deck is emulating like newer hardware pretty well to like, didn't they get a switch emulator

51:37.840 --> 51:38.840
running on it?

51:38.840 --> 51:43.800
Again, I don't advocate for piracy of stuff, especially not independent developed games

51:43.800 --> 51:45.240
and so forth.

51:45.240 --> 51:50.640
I, I think it's, I, I, you know, I, I'm not gonna deny that it exists and I think it's

51:50.640 --> 51:57.760
interesting for sure because it sounds like Nintendo was like shutting down YouTube's

51:57.760 --> 52:03.920
that were explaining how to get switch emulators on your steam deck, which I thought was very

52:03.920 --> 52:04.920
interesting.

52:04.920 --> 52:09.040
Um, and you know, I, I understand Nintendo trying to shut down those channels, but we

52:09.040 --> 52:14.040
all know once on the internet, always, always on the internet and if that's why the way

52:14.040 --> 52:18.680
back machine exists, if somebody wants to emulate a switch on the steam deck, they're

52:18.680 --> 52:20.640
going to figure it out.

52:20.640 --> 52:22.640
So, yep.

52:22.640 --> 52:28.560
And Mike Deaf says, which I mean, apparently, yes, the PC is, uh, I mean, why not?

52:28.560 --> 52:29.560
Yeah.

52:29.560 --> 52:34.360
And again, I, I don't advocate doing that, but for retro library and game preservations

52:34.360 --> 52:39.080
and things that Nintendo refuses to let us buy, uh, I feel a lot differently.

52:39.080 --> 52:45.360
Um, let's see, um, interesting Rama, uh, in our chat over at twitch.tv slash log network

52:45.360 --> 52:50.560
says, based on the success of the steam deck, I could see a newer steam machine or even

52:50.560 --> 52:57.040
a steam tablet staying, um, that maybe they would revisit the steam machine concept.

52:57.040 --> 52:58.760
I suppose anything's possible.

52:58.760 --> 53:05.600
I kind of think this is it now, but who knows, uh, very interesting aha moment from fifth

53:05.600 --> 53:10.880
dream who says ESP games can now run natively on switch, LOL.

53:10.880 --> 53:14.800
I mean, Vita, I heard about that, that the Vita emulator now runs on switch.

53:14.800 --> 53:20.240
Uh, I, when I first read that, my brain went to the steam deck running these games, but

53:20.240 --> 53:24.920
isn't that also an interesting way to preserve the libraries, especially when we know Sony

53:24.920 --> 53:29.360
wants nothing more to be than to be rid of the Vita online service.

53:29.360 --> 53:31.120
Did they finally say they were going to shut it down?

53:31.120 --> 53:32.120
I don't even remember.

53:32.280 --> 53:36.840
I feel like they finally are starting to end of life it, but, um, very interesting.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.240
Um, let's see.

53:40.240 --> 53:44.200
There was one other thing I wanted to say, Oh, uh, before we get to the next story, a

53:44.200 --> 53:49.640
comment on my internet, Rama said, just because you have gigabit internet, that doesn't mean

53:49.640 --> 53:51.680
you'll always have one gig up and down.

53:51.920 --> 53:56.520
Mine is in the 800 or excuse me, 800 to 95 megabyte at any given time.

53:56.720 --> 53:57.280
So Ms.

53:57.280 --> 53:59.120
Flight Sim would take less than 30 minutes.

53:59.360 --> 54:02.240
So to answer that question, I do have gigabit internet.

54:02.600 --> 54:06.640
Most of the speed tests are pretty reliably giving me between 900 and a thousand.

54:06.640 --> 54:08.120
So knock on wood, it's pretty good.

54:08.680 --> 54:12.600
Here's the fun, here's the fun thing you might not know because it's new development and

54:12.600 --> 54:15.600
you know, we're, you know, we're pretty close to city center and all that.

54:15.960 --> 54:21.880
Um, 2000 and 5,005 gigabit was an option.

54:22.400 --> 54:26.600
Um, but we act, we actually said that might actually be too much.

54:26.800 --> 54:31.800
I w and I was really trying to think, why would we need five gigabit?

54:32.120 --> 54:33.960
And I'm not sure we need it right now.

54:35.000 --> 54:40.200
Like my PC can't even support streaming 4k, just processing it.

54:40.560 --> 54:43.240
I'm not sure I need the bandwidth for that right now.

54:43.560 --> 54:44.840
Maybe in the future, who knows?

54:44.880 --> 54:45.320
But yeah.

54:45.360 --> 54:51.160
Uh, so that's what I, I actually do not have the best available internet here because I

54:51.160 --> 54:55.680
said that, that, that might be a bit much, but in 10 years.

54:56.680 --> 54:57.880
That may be what we need.

54:58.920 --> 55:00.440
So, all right.

55:00.440 --> 55:02.360
It's a mixed reaction from chat.

55:02.360 --> 55:05.080
Some people saying why the hell not others saying valid.

55:05.120 --> 55:05.840
All right, fair enough.

55:06.320 --> 55:10.640
Um, anyway, we talked a minute ago about the Nintendo switch turning five years old,

55:10.640 --> 55:14.360
and I'm not sure this was intentionally timed for the anniversary, but it is

55:14.360 --> 55:17.240
interesting that, uh, this comes out just in time for that.

55:17.240 --> 55:21.760
And that is that Nintendo switch now has missions and rewards.

55:22.560 --> 55:25.560
And when I first heard that, I got excited because I thought that meant,

55:25.560 --> 55:27.840
Ooh, finally achievements.

55:29.880 --> 55:36.680
It's not really that, um, it's like, no, no, it's a little more like Microsoft's

55:36.680 --> 55:40.840
rewards, which I've talked a little bit about on this show before, but Microsoft's

55:40.840 --> 55:46.280
rewards is basically you get points when you use game pass, um, when you earn an

55:46.280 --> 55:50.320
achievement, ironically enough, although that's not here, um, what does the Nintendo

55:50.320 --> 55:50.840
thing do?

55:51.600 --> 55:57.360
You get my Nintendo platinum points, um, by doing certain things within the Nintendo

55:57.360 --> 55:57.840
switch.

55:58.000 --> 56:03.440
So for example, if you play a game within the Nintendo switch online library, you get

56:03.440 --> 56:04.440
some platinum points.

56:04.880 --> 56:09.000
Um, you get, uh, for, for logging into the website and doing other things, you get

56:09.000 --> 56:09.680
platinum points.

56:09.920 --> 56:14.680
So you do these things and they've given more rewards for platinum points because it

56:14.680 --> 56:18.520
felt like for a while there, there wasn't shit you could get with platinum points.

56:18.920 --> 56:23.400
Um, I remember for a hot minute, there was like a Zelda P cross game you could get on

56:23.400 --> 56:27.840
3DS and like there were some decent things you could get with platinum points, but it

56:27.840 --> 56:29.240
hasn't been that way for a while.

56:29.720 --> 56:34.000
Now you're going to be able to get, um, apparently physical items from the Nintendo

56:34.000 --> 56:39.160
store, or at least they claim, I imagine you have to be fast to get those, but you can

56:39.160 --> 56:45.560
also get digital perks like wallpapers and icon elements, but also changing your user

56:45.560 --> 56:51.160
icon within the switch with new frames, new characters and new backgrounds.

56:51.480 --> 56:53.160
So that's something a little bit new.

56:53.360 --> 56:57.520
And some of you might find that silly, but at the same time, you're not really having

56:57.520 --> 56:59.440
to do much to get these points either.

56:59.480 --> 57:02.800
Um, you don't have to do anything like, you don't, you don't really have to spend

57:02.800 --> 57:07.080
money unless you don't already have Nintendo switch online or something in order to do

57:07.080 --> 57:07.360
that.

57:07.680 --> 57:10.960
So, um, there are some rewards posted right now.

57:10.960 --> 57:13.240
There are some various animal crossing characters.

57:13.280 --> 57:17.600
I don't recognize any of these, but I think they are the same animal crossing characters

57:17.600 --> 57:19.280
that have March birthdays.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.480
So that's, that's the tie in.

57:21.720 --> 57:24.400
And then it looks like some super Mario Odyssey icons.

57:24.440 --> 57:27.000
Like I see, um, uh, captain toad in there.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
I see some of the various, uh, like, um, the cheap, cheap wearing the Mario hat and

57:32.000 --> 57:32.600
things like that.

57:32.800 --> 57:36.400
There's some just unique icons you can get with those, which is all right.

57:37.000 --> 57:42.600
You, I guess, but probably nothing anyone's going to drop everything and go for, but

57:42.600 --> 57:45.240
you know, if they get up the quality of some of these rewards, that could be very

57:45.240 --> 57:45.680
interesting.

57:45.680 --> 57:52.240
I think, um, I just, man, I felt like we were getting so close to achievements, which

57:52.240 --> 57:52.760
would be fun.

57:52.800 --> 57:55.600
I just, and I talked about this on last week's show.

57:55.600 --> 58:00.360
I hate saying this time blue in the face, but it would just be so cool if we could

58:00.360 --> 58:05.960
have like a digital trophy shelf to really show that I beat kid Icarus without using a

58:05.960 --> 58:06.440
code.

58:06.920 --> 58:11.000
That's a bit, that should be, that should be recognized as the big fucking deal that

58:11.000 --> 58:11.520
it is.

58:12.200 --> 58:13.960
Yeah, that game ain't easy.

58:14.280 --> 58:14.920
Exactly.

58:14.960 --> 58:16.280
So I think it'd be nice.

58:16.680 --> 58:22.280
Uh, E3VL says, log in a week, once a week for 30 points, mobile games for platinum

58:22.280 --> 58:22.640
points.

58:22.680 --> 58:24.880
Oh, I think that was a thing for a hot minute too.

58:25.160 --> 58:29.160
You could get some rewards and like the animal crossing game and the Mario cart game

58:29.160 --> 58:30.240
with your platinum points.

58:30.320 --> 58:34.280
So that's, um, that's another thing you can, um, I think, I think is still available.

58:34.760 --> 58:38.080
So, yeah, I think that's still about, I haven't checked in a while.

58:38.400 --> 58:41.480
Yeah, I've, it's been a while since I played any of the Nintendo mobile titles.

58:42.400 --> 58:42.760
All right.

58:42.760 --> 58:44.480
Uh, moving on dark soccer.

58:44.480 --> 58:45.120
What do you have for us?

58:46.280 --> 58:47.480
I have a thing.

58:47.520 --> 58:55.040
Well, and as we, uh, teased at the end of Bobby's show, um, uh, Epic games has made an

58:55.040 --> 58:58.520
acquisition and we know that Epic games is a video game company.

58:58.520 --> 59:00.840
They've got their store, they did Fortnite.

59:01.240 --> 59:08.960
Um, but they acquired band camp, which when I first saw that, I just went, I burped a

59:09.200 --> 59:09.680
little bit.

59:10.480 --> 59:15.920
Um, but they announced that they were quote joining Epic games.

59:15.960 --> 59:22.360
So there's nothing about like an actual, how much they paid, what the details are, but

59:23.360 --> 59:27.000
they say that band camp's going to keep operating the way that it did.

59:27.480 --> 59:33.960
Um, um, but that they turned down previous, uh, corporate attempts, but believe that

59:33.960 --> 59:36.200
Epic is aligned with their vision and values.

59:36.960 --> 59:40.840
Um, so it is what it is.

59:40.840 --> 59:49.120
So, um, hopefully it will, it won't affect, you know, band camp continuing with the way

59:49.120 --> 59:53.520
that they are, but at the same time, I'm a little bit iffy.

59:53.720 --> 59:58.600
I just, there's things Epic does that just make me unhappy.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:03.080
But now the good thing about band camp though, is that like I've been introduced to so many

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:03.640
good artists.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.560
Like that's how I learned about Mystery Skulls.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:15.520
Um, and it was actually, I had seen that whole video that was a parody of, uh, Phoenix

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:19.240
Wright, the, the turntable turnabout.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:26.400
And that had me looking for that song, which led me to finding, uh, the band camp site,

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.440
uh, their, their album on band camp, which, which I bought.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.320
Um, I found a lot of good artists that way.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:38.440
So, uh, hopefully they'll still continue to be able to give people the exposure, especially

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.400
for people just starting out.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.640
So, um, I, I don't know, it's, it's weird.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.160
I understand why indie artists have reservations.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:46.920
Absolutely.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.560
And you're right.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:52.040
Epic does have a strange track record, um, especially, you know, the guy running it writes

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:57.960
a lot of dumb shit on Twitter and, you know, picks fights, uh, try trying to be a, um, a

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:01.840
martyr when, you know, he has problems in his own backyard.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.480
But anyway, I digress, but I see why people have problems with it.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.360
Um, I could see, you know, and a lot of people are thinking, Oh, this is like a Fortnite

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:10.760
thing.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.680
And, you know, no, they're insisting, like, they're not changing band camp or anything

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:20.680
like that, but it could be interesting, especially, you know, if, if, if Fortnite really is more

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.480
than just a shooter game, which is what the creators of Fortnite wants you to believe.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:29.800
And if trying to try to show in interesting cases, like we talked many months ago on the

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.560
show about the Ariana Grande concert.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.000
And that was the first thing that happened in Fortnite in a long time that really made me

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.640
look and go the fuck, but like in a good way, because it was something where it was like,

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.760
okay, Fortnite is being used for something that I don't associate with Fortnite.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And that was like an interactive music video type of thing.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.680
So my point is.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.960
That thing isn't exactly unprecedented.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:49.560
Yeah.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:57.560
But if, if Epic is trying to leverage band camp or indie artists exposure to tie together

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:04.280
Fortnite into some type of pop culture universe soundtrack made by indie artists, I could see

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:09.200
that there may be some exciting prospects there, but I also completely understand and respect that

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.920
there are some indie artists that want fucking nothing to do with Fortnite and don't want

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.880
anything to change.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.480
And I think it's important to keep them happy or guess what?

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.320
They'll just form a new site like band camp.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.880
It should be just, there should be options for it.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.080
There's nothing stopping the indie artists from leaving at any time and going to a new

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:27.560
place.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.400
That's the thing.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.720
Epic didn't buy the music.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.240
Epic bought band camp.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:37.840
Some interesting perspectives in chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network, because we are where

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.160
every gamer has a voice and some voices on this.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:46.040
Rama says, I did hear that Tencent pushed Epic's hand because Tencent already has investments in

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.320
Spotify and other music services.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.560
If I recall correctly, it feels like Tencent.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.040
That actually has been mentioned about it too.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:02.400
But I mean, there's also the mention though, that since Epic acquired, uh, harmonics that maybe

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.800
they already had the interest in music.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:05.960
Uh, S.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:10.560
Joe and Hunter Matt says, uh, well, a wait and see, but I totally get the indie artist whose

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.120
livelihood is tied to this system that is now going to be in bed with Tencent as well.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:15.440
Yeah.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.600
I understand the reservations for sure.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.120
For sure.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.800
So we'll just have to see what develops and, um, what Epic does with this.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.040
Moving on Loki.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:26.600
Yeah.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:27.960
So this is pretty cool news.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:35.560
So we've got John Romero, the co-creator of the doom franchise, and he is releasing a brand new

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.480
level for doom too.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.960
He's like charging a five year old for it.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.960
And, um, if you, uh, make that donation, you can get the wonderful level and a hundred percent of the

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:54.320
proceeds go towards, uh, the red cross and UN central emergency response funds.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:02.200
So for a good cause, and you get to play some new doom, considering that he hasn't made a level for

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.800
doom or at least doom too, since I think the game came out.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:12.520
I heard some of the personal effects with this are very nice as well, that he actually has like the

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:17.320
community created identification files in there and that he filled them out.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:22.720
Just like any other like fan content creator would, and that, I guess there's a section that

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:26.000
refers to what other wads did this creator make?

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.480
Cause, uh, WAD is the type of like doom.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:28.840
Yeah.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.360
And he just put doom dot wad, doom two dot wad.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:35.760
And I thought that was funny.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.000
Like it's the little effects like that, that made this cute.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:44.920
But I also love the fact that, you know, like, This is a really creative way to like raise money for a

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:51.560
cause like this is, this is somebody coming back from, you know, the class, the archives really to get

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.440
back on the horse.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.560
And, and I don't know if this was new or maybe something that was unfinished before.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:01.040
Um, but I think this is really cool and definitely, you know, something that, um, is worthy of, of

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.040
tossing some point at.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.200
So, um, yeah, pretty cool.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:04.600
Yeah.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:11.400
I wonder what other classic, uh, game developers, you think we could get David Crane to make a pitfall three.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.440
Who knows?

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:14.480
Who knows?

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.520
Maybe a pinball table.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:15.680
No.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:15.880
Okay.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:24.400
I don't, I don't, I don't want to make light of a, what is a serious fundraising effort, but I just think it's a, it's a really cool, uh, like innovative way to do some fundraising.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.000
And I hope it's really.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.400
All right, moving on.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:43.880
I also hope this is successful because let me tell you, as much as I enjoy Microsoft flight simulator on Xbox series X, it is painfully obvious that it is just a port of a PC game running on the series X up to the point that when you first launched a game,

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:50.360
you see a computer mouse in the upper left-hand corner of the screen that you can't use or touch or do anything with.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.600
It's kind of humorous to me.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:56.200
Um, it's interesting that Legend of Zaku says you need to use a flight stick.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:56.720
I do.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:01.080
I'm not buying a flight stick may well, never say never.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.480
I'm not interested in one yet, but I will say.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.680
Flight simulator is like, it's a beautiful game.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:16.520
It is just, it's a beautiful, chill game, very relaxing, very relaxing to just, you know, chill out and play flight simulator.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.360
It's great.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:26.040
So, um, anyway, uh, looking at, uh, the next story, which talks about keyboard and mouse support potentially coming to Xbox cloud gaming.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:37.920
Um, and actually they're talking about flight simulator in this, uh, report too, is that, uh, you can't use a keyboard and mouse on the Xbox one version.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:47.520
But according to the, uh, head of the team that made flight simulator, Jorg Newman, uh, there was a Q and a, uh, that was done.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.280
And, uh, Jorg Newman said Microsoft is working on adding.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.920
Platform level support for keyboard and mouse.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.400
And most games on Xbox cloud gaming could include this method.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.400
The quote is.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.840
So the platform team is working on this.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.640
I know I can't give a date because it's the platform team.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.560
I don't know their dates, but it's coming.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:12.920
I'm hoping it will be done by June or so, but I can't ever tell that seems kind of new.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:23.760
Uh, so the verge, uh, saw this interview and asked Microsoft to make an official comment, which a spokesperson said, quote at launch Microsoft fight simulator.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.320
I say fight simulator, Microsoft flight simulator supports standard controller inputs for cloud gaming.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:35.400
The team is experimenting with touch gyro and is excited to embrace mouse and keyboard.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:40.800
Once it's available on the platform, we have no specific announcements or timing to share at this time.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.960
Um, some other things that could really benefit from mouse and keyboard support.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:51.200
PC and Mac players could play halo infinite with their keyboard and mouse on the cloud.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:58.600
Cause even if you're playing halo infinite today on a PC on the cloud, if you're playing it, not on the cloud, you can use the word mouse.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.840
We've played the cloud version.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:05.720
You have to use a controller because the cloud is all powered with Xbox series X.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.160
So that could be very interesting.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.280
Um, and, uh, yeah, I'm all for it.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:18.280
I think, uh, there are some games I enjoy with, uh, a controller, but there's a lot I enjoy with keyboard and mouse as well.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:18.840
Sure.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:25.200
Doc was trying to win me over in chat saying it's not that expensive for Microsoft flight simulator.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.160
We'll see.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:26.600
We'll see.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.400
We'll see someday.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.960
Rob, what thrift?

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.200
Oh, maybe I'll keep an eye out for you.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.720
Maybe that's not a bad idea.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.200
We'll see.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.480
I find flight sticks all the time at thrift stores.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.440
So I'll keep my eyes open.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.680
All right, moving on.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.280
We may have one I could lend you.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:40.760
I don't know.

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.560
What do you have for us?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:53.160
So there is, it's right now still a bit of a rumor, but, um, Oh my goodness.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:09:00.320
So Star Wars Eclipse, the game that was to be developed by Quantic Dream, uh, may actually be canceled.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:07.640
Um, they were basically, they put out that, like that really pretty trailer and everyone was excited about it.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:15.600
But, um, it was supposed to be released in 2024, but they're saying it can be pushed back to 2027 or 2028.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:22.520
Uh, Quantic Dream, uh, well, first of all, we know that they've had some problems with their toxic work culture.

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:35.440
Um, but they were basically saying that with that trailer, the purpose of it was to, of course, attack, attract a talent to, to help work on the game, but it didn't have the desired effect.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.000
Uh, no one would step up and work on it.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.080
Um, the staffing issues are really, really the, the issue.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:49.920
Um, the, the site actually is quoted as saying, staffing issues are pushing the release of the game far, far away.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:54.400
As a result, Star Wars Eclipse is likely to be released around 2027 to 2028.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:03.800
And on top of that, Quantic Dream has been really pushing to get more job openings, but they're going unfilled.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:14.400
Um, they have, they update their dates for the same job openings and, uh, and now it's also rumored that they're trying to shop themselves out for acquisition.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:22.880
So, um, oh, and the other thing too, is that they're saying that there's some problems with the, with the QD game engine, which they would be using for Star Wars Eclipse.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.640
So any number of reasons.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.800
So I'll believe it when I see it.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:38.320
I really, you know, I like the games that they've made, even if I don't enjoy the, you know, what the, excuse me, what the company has done.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:47.480
I would like to hope that maybe bringing in new talent and new blood, if they could get the people would change their, the culture there.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.160
But that's, seems like it's going to be a bit of a pipe dream.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.320
So we'll see what happens.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:59.120
Yeah, that would just surprise me because they, I feel like they just announced that game and then for it to disappear.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:06.680
But I mean, everything you're saying logically makes sense that when has that not happened before though, that trailer was supposed to drum up interest.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.800
That's not happening because of all this other bullshit going on.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.280
So like, I would have played the crap out of that.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:12.800
Yeah.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:13.560
Yeah.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:23.280
It is interesting though, the idea that they could get acquired, um, and that may be their way, you know, I mean, look at how Activision's getting out of this mess and how we're finally getting rid of Bobby Kotick.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:35.160
You know, it's going to take two years in Microsoft, but, and maybe that's what happens ultimately with Quantic Dream is, and I can, I could see Sony being a huge partner for them, especially after things like Detroit and so forth.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:39.080
Um, they make beautiful games is the thing.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:53.280
Um, it's just, it would be my hope that they would be able to change themselves enough and prove that they've changed so that they can attract the right kind of people.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:12:04.520
The right kind of talent back to the company and, and really put out another, another masterpiece, but we'll see.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:06.720
All right.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.120
Going back to Loki.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.120
All right.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.320
So we've got an acquisition by Netflix games.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:25.200
Uh, purchase the developer next games, who is a mobile game developer who has worked on titles like the walking dead, our world, the walking dead, no man's land.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:37.960
And of course also producing stranger things, puzzle tales, uh, which I think, I think that might be on their service that like a Netflix game service or whatever that they have, uh, with the mobile games.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:51.280
I think it might be on there, but, um, basically saying that we're excited for next games to join Netflix as a core studio in the strategic region and key talent market expanding our internal game studio capabilities.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:13:00.320
While we're just starting in games, I'm confident that together next games, we'll be able to build a portfolio of world-class games that will delight our members around the world.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.600
Okay, cool.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.600
Hope that happens.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:11.200
Um, so far, I haven't been impressed with anything that Netflix games has had, but I mean, that can turn around.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.640
Obviously they're, you know, they're doing a lot of stuff in the whole, um, you know, movie and TV space.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.240
So why not?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.040
It just takes the right game to really get them going, right?

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:28.440
You know, a lot of people were ready to write off Amazon games because it felt like, you know, that first game, I don't even remember where that first game was.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.920
They launched that flopped.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.680
Um, and then a new world was taken forever.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:38.320
But when it launched new world was kind of the talk of the town for about two weeks, and now it's really died out.

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.040
Thank you.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.760
Crucible since questmaster, that was it.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.240
Uh, and now lost arc is doing very well for them.

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:47.840
So, um, you know, it just takes the right game.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.040
Really get you going and get the buzz going about you.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.520
Yeah, we'll see.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:00.760
Um, let's move on to a story, uh, about a game that's been updated and I think this is pretty neat.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:09.960
Um, it's game called the Haven, which I remember I actually played this because it was on Xbox game pass, but they removed it just in time for this to come out.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.760
But I think this is neat.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:23.240
Um, it, and the whole thing is like a love story is really what it's about because our relationships based story, uh, between two characters, you and Kay, and they're on a alien world.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.720
And they do, they do the part of it.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.080
Part of it felt like a little bit like flower to me.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:35.200
Like, I know that seems weird, but the main mechanic of the game kind of, it was like flower a little bit to me, but you're kind of like dashing through landscapes and doing things.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:48.000
But anyway, um, and, uh, pretty much the way this game has existed for the last, I think about two years that it's been out, uh, you and Kay have been a male female couple.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:53.240
Well, a major update just came out and you can change the genders of the couple.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:15:00.120
So now you can play the game if you want as the way it was before a woman and a man, or you can play two women.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.720
Or you can play two men.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.040
Um, and this isn't just like a re skinning.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.760
Uh, they actually went in and, and made this work.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:18.120
Uh, the characters have been essentially redesigned, but like they still retain elements of like the characters from before.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.120
Uh, so they, they, they just, it's, it's interesting.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:30.360
Um, and, uh, let's see, there are three D renders now of both characters, two D assets for the characters, new voices.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:37.720
So Lexi and Kendrick and Ryan highly voice the new characters, because obviously now there's a new male character and a new female character.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.320
So they have new voices with that.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.000
So that's interesting.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:43.760
They still have the same personality, the same backstory, the same life.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:52.080
Uh, they say for technical reasons, it's the same body size, hairstyle and body shape, but I don't think that really matters at the end of the day.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:59.040
Um, so, and they also redid the written dialogue in all eight languages that Haven is available in.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:08.400
And any line that has explicit or implicit gender references, they've been modified to work with, um, the new like gender roles.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.000
So like if you called K Mr.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.280
Uh, that doesn't work so much anymore.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.240
So they modified it.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:25.080
So it's interesting because they say originally the game was going to have eight couples to explore a diverse range of relationships, but that was scaled back.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.880
But this couples update has allowed them to go back and explore some of those ideas.

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:35.200
So that's, that's a very comprehensive update for a game that's been out for a little bit.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:41.040
And certainly for many people, I think it's going to have them give a second look to a game that they may have skipped before.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.160
So I think that's pretty.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.960
All right, well, let's go back.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:49.640
Let's go back to a time when, uh, you could not edit a game.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.360
You, you just, you had the game you had and that's it.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.520
You couldn't, you couldn't go back and do updates to it.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.080
Let's, let's roll the bumper.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:15.080
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.280
It's time for classic game of the week.

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.880
But once a month, dark Sakura mixes it up a little bit.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.840
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us tonight?

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:35.160
I have the, um, well, it's the handheld of the week and this one is, um, um, uh, I

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.680
have no comment it's the game com or game.com as, as it's written.

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.480
It's, it's, uh, why did I pick this anyway?

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:50.720
Um, it is a fifth generation handheld console by tiger electronics, but I am

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.480
considering this just in general, one of those handheld electronics.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.880
Cause really, have you seen one?

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.880
Um, they had, uh, it was released, um, on September 12th, 1997.

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.320
I think we still have one somewhere?

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.160
Question mark.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.320
Um, there's also a smaller version in mid 1999 called the game.com pocket pro.

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:16.480
And, uh, it had internet because of the.com.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.640
It had to have internet.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.480
It was a 14.4 kilobit, uh, per second.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.160
It's.com.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:34.920
It sold fewer than 300,000 units and was discontinued in 2000 because of poor sales.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.240
Yes.

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:46.120
Anyway, the, the, uh, it was, uh, it had brought out this thing called the

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:52.280
R zone console in 1995 to compete with the virtual boy, but it was also a flop.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.560
Um, they also had like the different LCD, of course, games and everything.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.160
And this is just really more of a cartridge based extension of the

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.040
little tiger electronic handheld games.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:07.000
Um, so they, uh, surprised anyone would want to compete with the virtual boy.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:15.520
Less headaches, maybe, but anyway, um, they, uh, they wanted this to come out

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:20.040
as a direct competitor to the game boy, and they were stated as saying that

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.600
this would quote, change the gaming world as we know it, and that it

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.280
would be one of the summer's hits.

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:33.120
Um, it was the only new game console of the year at, uh, E3 1997.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.520
They expected it to start selling in July and, uh, they were saying

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:41.480
that it was interesting and called it a game boy for adults.

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:47.960
So it sold for 69.95, had an internet access cartridge,

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.760
uh, for release in October.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.760
The game included with it was Lights Out and Solitaire was built into the console.

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.920
Um, it was marked as Tiger's largest project launch ever.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.280
They had a website at the domain game.com.

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.920
They marketed TV.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:09.240
They just had all kinds of business.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:13.720
It was released in the UK for, uh, uh, 79.99.

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:18.080
Um, it was black and black and white.

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:24.320
Um, basically just, uh, it had a very similar design to, uh, the game gear,

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:27.320
but a lot more rectangular, not so sleek.

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.440
Um, it had a larger screen than the game boy and had higher resolution.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.800
It included a phone directory, a calculator, and a calendar,

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:38.520
um, and had some PDA features.

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.440
So, uh, you know, it was supposed to be kind of cool.

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.320
You know, it was, uh, supposed to be simple, cheap.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.560
It was powered by four AA batteries.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.240
You had an AC adapter available.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.280
Um, you also had, uh, what was called the complete.com serial cable.

01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:59.800
So you could connect your consoles, uh, to play multiplayer games.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.840
Uh, there were, uh, two game cartridge slots.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:06.160
I thought that, that honestly, I thought that was pretty cool so that you wouldn't

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.560
need to switch out your, your cartridge, but it would allow you to put in like the

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:12.440
internet cartridge and another game so you could play it online.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:17.120
Um, it was one of the first, actually it was the first gaming

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.840
console to feature a touch screen.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:24.680
And, uh, it was also the first handheld console to have internet connectivity.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:32.440
Um, the monochrome touch screen was, uh, let's see, measures, uh, one and a half

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:38.120
inches by two inches and had a square zones imprinted onto the screen to let

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:41.200
the players determine where they were going to apply their stylus.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.840
Um, it, it, uh, the touch screen did not have a backlight.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:51.640
Um, it, it also was the first internal, uh, sorry, first, uh, handheld system

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:55.760
to have internal memory, which is used to save high scores and contact information.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:01.840
Um, they then released a smaller version called, uh, the game.com pocket pro.

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:07.240
Um, and it was also shown at E3, uh, May, 1999.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:10.520
It was released in June, 1999 for $29.99.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.520
Had five different colors because of course it did.

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.560
I mean, everyone had to, had to make after Apple that year.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.840
Um, it actually was completely without color.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.360
Um, it was designed to be the size of a Game Boy Pocket.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:28.360
Um, different, you know, screen size.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.040
It only had one cartridge slot.

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.960
Um, it required two double A batteries.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.040
It included the directory, a calendar, a calculator,

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.520
but lacked internet capability.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:40.400
Um, and it was meant to compete with Game Boy Color, but it didn't have color.

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:46.760
So, um, going back to those internet features though, um, it had a cartridge,

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:51.640
um, it required a cartridge and a dial-up modem, neither came with the system.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:57.280
You could read email, it could, it could be read and sent on the

01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.920
gameboy.com using that cartridge.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:04.120
Um, it supported text only web browsing through, uh, the internet service

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:08.920
providers, um, you could not save your email though, to the internal memory.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:15.880
Um, and, uh, you had to use the internet surface, uh, service through Delphi that

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:21.040
was made specifically to work on the game.com, um, the web link cartridge

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:26.280
came out that allowed players to connect to their, uh, computer and using that

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:29.640
cartridge, they could upload their high scores to the game.com website,

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.800
uh, to be, uh, listed on webpage.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:37.000
And, uh, none of those games, even though they had the internet, the

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.240
cartridge that you could use at the same time, none of those supported any kind

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.880
of internet features with the games.

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.440
So when they came out.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:50.880
So overall, um, uh, the audio for it was, uh, was mono, um, two 4-bit waveform

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.680
generators, uh, with their own frequency, volume control and waveform data,

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.880
and noise generator and one direct 8-bit PCM output channel.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.880
Um, a handful of games came out for it.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:08.640
It had a really, really light, uh, light, uh, library.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:09.440
That's what I'm thinking of.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:15.600
Um, it, they plan to have like a dozen games available when it came out, but,

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:19.280
uh, yeah, they, uh, that didn't happen.

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:25.880
Um, so the games themselves, um, were on 16 megabit cartridges.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.280
Um, they were ranged between $19 and $29.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.880
Um, the games that came out, there were the, there are 20 games.

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:37.920
Most of them developed, uh, internally by Tiger, apart from Solitaire.

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:39.920
Well, actually Solitaire is included.

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:43.760
There was Solitaire, Batman and Robin, Centipede, Duke Nukem 3D, Fighters,

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:50.320
Megamix, Frogger, Henry, Indy 500, Jeopardy, Lights Out, which was the pack-in,

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:54.960
uh, Lost World, Jurassic Park, Monopoly, Mortal Kombat trilogy, Quiz Whiz,

01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:00.640
Cyber Trivia, Resident Evil 2, um, which I know is one of the ones I had, Scrabble,

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.880
Sonic Jam, Tiger Casino, Wheel of Fortune, Wheel of Fortune 2, and Williams Arcade

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.480
Classics.

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:09.840
Um, they were supposed to have a version of Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:18.080
Um, like a Furby game, Metal Gear Solid, um, Sonic 3D Blast, uh, a WCW game,

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.360
Truck Dinosaur Hunter.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.120
There, there are some titles that were planned for it, but yeah.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.440
Let's be real.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.880
Thank God we never saw the horror of Symphony of the Night on this pizza

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.480
garbage.

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:33.520
Like looking at Resident Evil 2, which is what we're looking at as the, um, we're

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.600
broadcasting live on Twitch.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.000
Like, I'm sorry, this was like garbage.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.280
Like it's two frames a second.

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:38.320
Mission chat.

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.600
It looks like a CDI game, honestly.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.160
Like it looks like a CDI Zelda game.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.160
It's, it's not, that's not a compliment.

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:48.080
This, this is exactly what it played like.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.960
Um, but at any rate, like it had such negative reviews about it.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.160
Um, although the Wisconsin State Journal said that there was some serious

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:03.320
advantages over the Game Boy, including the touch screen, but, um, the, the

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:06.800
processor was only, gave it marginal improvements to the Game Boy.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.880
And the thing is, is that Tiger, apparently from the looks of it, didn't

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:16.520
know their system to program it as well as Nintendo did, or else they would have

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.240
been able to work around those limitations.

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:24.960
Um, it does have a, uh, a lasting legacy though of, uh, of having been

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:27.240
a system that really, really tried.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:31.840
There was apparently really good audio that came out of those speakers.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:38.400
Um, the PDA functionality for when it came out was a big factor for it, sort

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:45.080
of gave it that, uh, adult, you know, appeal, but it had some of the most

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.640
disappointing games that were made even worse by the outdated screen.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:50.520
And that is a quote.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:59.640
Um, so yeah, this basically is, uh, it's been listed as one of the worst

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:04.320
consoles of all time, especially because of the low screen quality

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:08.560
and it's a very, uh, thin library.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:14.000
Um, Nadia Oxford of US gamers, uh, said it died in record time because

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.760
it was poorly made to say the least.

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.040
So a legacy of failure, game.com.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.560
Print that on the back of the box.

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:30.400
Um, I, when you, when you say you tried is kind of the takeaway from this.

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.000
I laughed.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:31.440
You didn't.

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:33.760
Oh, I'm just laughing.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.760
Cause I just see that gold star where it's written in comic sans.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:37.360
You tried.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.640
Oh, this, the star is lopsided and tigers would be the lopsided one.

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:43.240
This is fuck you.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:43.680
I tried.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:44.600
Or fuck you.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:45.320
I did a good job.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:51.800
And everyone else would just be shaking their head and say, Oh honey, no.

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:53.520
All right.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.640
Everyone else would just give it like this, like puce colored star that just

01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:05.800
says, no, the classic handheld of the month, uh, the game.com not, not

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.840
everything, not everything as a highlight.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.200
So sometimes this isn't even a low light low light at least makes hair look pretty.

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:16.040
This isn't even that sometimes.

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.080
Sometimes backlight is like a flat shaded mid tone.

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.640
Sometimes we have to look back at our mistakes.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:28.960
Anyway, uh, the classic handheld of the month, uh, once a month dark

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:34.120
soccer in the year 2022 is picking a classic or at least notable, maybe

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:38.360
as a better word handheld, I don't even know if this was notable to be honest.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.960
It, it did.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.960
It, it did garner attention because again, it was the first touch screen

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:47.360
on a handheld first internal memory.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:52.200
It had some ambitious capabilities to it, but it's too bad.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:57.160
The rest of it flopped, but if they had put time into a better screen on this

01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:03.280
thing and up to the price point by like 10 bucks, that would have been a lot better.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:08.320
I mean, bump the processor a bit, put a better screen and it could have,

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.480
it could have been something, it could have been a contender.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:15.000
If they upgraded it to the point where it wasn't the thing that

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.800
it was, it would have been great.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:23.480
But, but you do say what I mean though, about, you know, the touch screen

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.440
and that touch screen, we eventually got them in our handheld consoles.

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:31.040
Our phones are, you know, that I try to look for my phone when

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.000
I'm using it as my webcam.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:35.520
Um, but we had that capability there.

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:41.760
I mean, this was one of the things that paved the way for what we expect out of,

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:46.480
you know, some of our modern handheld consoles and our phones and, and the

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:50.600
like, the internal memory was a big thing, having it act as a PDA was a big thing.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:54.880
It was just like, what was, what were the PDAs at the time?

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:55.680
Not the Blackberry.

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:57.120
This was before Blackberry, I think.

01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:58.280
A beeper?

01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:59.800
Like, hmm?

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:00.840
A beeper?

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:02.600
No, no, no, no.

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:04.640
It was like the big silver ones that-

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.840
Palm Pilot says-

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:07.160
Palm Pilot, yeah.

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:12.440
It was, it was like, it was, I think it was trying to do too much.

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.360
Perhaps.

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:19.080
If it, if that capability had been sent into the games and the display

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.520
instead of all that other business.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:27.440
I think it also stands as a symbol of that era where everything was dot com.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:30.840
You just, you just have to put the internet in everything and it's, and

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:34.800
honestly, cause we know, I mean, not every, not everybody knows because

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.880
some of you weren't born yet.

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:43.960
I was at the grocery store yesterday, somebody behind me buying liquor and

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.720
the cashier says, when were you born?

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.960
The person says 1997.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:51.520
And I'm like, ah, I'm so upset right now.

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:56.640
Anyway, I'm just saying, you all will feel it too someday.

01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:00.200
If you're sitting there going, I was born in 97, you'll, you will understand

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.000
my pain someday, someday, bitch, someday.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:05.200
By the way, Bobby would be proud of me.

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:11.120
Normally when I go to Daiso, they're playing like K-pop, they were actually

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:15.560
playing like seventies and eighties rock.

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.840
And one person's like, Oh my God, what's this?

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.880
I'm like, don't you dare say anything bad about Rush.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:20.680
I will end you.

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:28.800
And they looked over at me and like, and then I hear from another aisle.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.120
Yeah.

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.320
That happened at Daiso today.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:41.320
Uh, DJ Rama S says, I feel this anytime I hear eighties and nineties

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.600
music on the classic stations.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.880
Oh, it's even worse now.

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:45.000
It's like early 2000s.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:45.640
Oh yeah.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:46.240
That's agreed.

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:49.520
Oh no, you'll hear, I heard, I heard chili peppers on there actually.

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:50.720
Not like they're eighties.

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.720
They were playing like into, into like nineties stuff.

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:56.880
I heard Linkin Park on the classic rock station the other day.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.080
And I was like, just take me now.

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.680
Well, what gets me is what the easy listening station sounds like now.

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:09.960
Like, am I, I remember when my mother would listen to the easy, easy

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.520
listening station, it was always captain and Tennille's muskrat

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.560
love on at any given moment.

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:15.960
I kid you not.

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:19.720
I've heard that song more often than I ever wanted to in my life.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:24.880
Bobby Blackwolf points out Turner classic movies plays the matrix, a movie that was

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.800
released the same year as the game.com.

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:31.440
All right, I'm done.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:36.240
All of the hosts, all of the hosts in unison were like, one, two, all of

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:44.800
the hosts in unison were like one, two, three, baseball at desk.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.400
We don't need one, two switch.

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:47.600
We need one, two, what the fuck?

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:51.160
All right.

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.120
Anyway, uh, moving it.

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:53.920
That was also weird.

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:57.400
Cause when you turned off your camera, like they got to see the, the preview

01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:01.840
shot and it went into infinity mirror mode where he saw the same shot over and over.

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:03.600
All right.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.360
Anyway, uh, let's move on quickly.

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:10.120
We need to, we need to make ourselves feel better.

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.720
Let's do some rapid fire news.

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.720
I hope the news is good.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.720
We'll travel around the industry quickly and look at some big headlines.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:16.920
Uh, Loki, we'll start with you.

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.240
Yeah, we have another fundraiser going on with itch IO.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:25.920
So this is where you can get almost 500 games for $5 through itch IO and it's to

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:31.760
help the Texas trends community, because if you, uh, are not familiar with what's

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:36.480
going on in the United States and specifically Texas and Florida, lots of

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:41.640
horrible things when it comes to, um, marginalized communities.

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:42.760
So that's great.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.680
Thank you, thank you, Texas for being Texas.

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:49.520
Um, but at least this will hopefully help the fight against that.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.160
So you can, uh, check that out on itch IO.

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.400
That's a great cause.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:00.120
I mean, fuck all of that going on in Texas, that goes without saying and, uh, props

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.720
to the district attorneys that are standing up against it saying they're not

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:03.600
going to enforce it.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:10.440
Um, but, uh, I I'm very, it always warms my heart just a little bit when I see

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.120
gaming companies, especially the indie developers who quite frankly could use

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:19.520
that money themselves, um, getting in on this sort of action, this really lovely

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:20.560
Yeah.

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:25.040
And it, it, the, the bundle in case you're looking for it is called TT RPGs for

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:27.680
trans rights in Texas bundle.

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:35.720
Um, so just search for that, um, on itch IO and then, um, so apparently the cuphead

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.800
show, which came out, I have not watched it.

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.720
My son binge watched the whole thing.

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:41.720
He said it was all right.

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:45.760
Um, so it's been renewed for a second season.

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.760
So apparently it is somewhat popular.

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.560
Um, so yeah, check it out on Netflix.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.400
If you haven't seen it yet.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.800
Have you heard the social media discourse on this?

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.560
Apparently one of the people, one of the people behind the scenes on this came out

01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:03.000
and said, well, it's not really season two, it's the second half of episodes for

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.200
season one, and they're doing this to screw us all in our contracts and

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.360
animation gets treated like this all the time.

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.120
How do you think your animated series get turned around so fast and

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.560
suddenly there's new episodes?

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.840
So I thought, I thought that was interesting.

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.080
I mean, you know, obviously it doesn't, it doesn't lessen the quality of the

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.680
show or anything like that, but it just, it's just basically the whole thing

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:25.520
is to make Netflix look like assholes, you know, basically.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:28.040
Um, but I thought, I thought that was interesting.

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:29.200
Mike deaf points out.

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.560
There are already 36 episodes in production.

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:36.640
So it's, it's not really a season two, but it's a continuation

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.440
of what already exists.

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:41.480
However, yeah, that there are more episodes.

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:45.520
Um, uh, Bobby Blackwell says contractually, they get a three point three to

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.480
five percent raise for a second season.

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.080
Netflix bought one season and is batching them.

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:51.960
That's what it is.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:53.480
That's how they're getting screwed out of it.

01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.120
Just something to think about.

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:01.000
I mean, not that it should necessarily stop you from watching or supporting

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.960
the show, but maybe buy some merch or put money into the creator's

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:07.160
pockets, uh, another way to, all right.

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.600
Uh, anyhow, dark soccer.

01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:15.160
Well, um, there is a game called Mina, the hollower that is going to have guest

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:20.880
tracks from the legendary Yuzo Koshiro as in, you know, the, the person that

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:24.560
gave us the music and streets of rage act, razor, uh, super smash brothers,

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:28.040
I train Odyssey, um, uh, one gun, midnight, maximum tune.

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:33.840
Uh, I am, I'm honestly, I think that this would make me just want to play the game

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.880
anyway, but the game looks actually really whimsical and very cool.

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.720
So I might, I might be giving that one a try.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:45.560
Um, also, uh, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3, and Resident Evil 7

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:52.040
Biohazard are, uh, coming to PS5 and Xbox series in 2022.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:58.280
Um, so Capcom is going to be releasing those a little bit later this year.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:03.680
If you already have them on PS4 or Xbox one, you can upgrade, uh, their

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:07.760
versions for the PS5 or Xbox series version at no additional cost.

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:12.960
Um, there will be, uh, upgrade patches available for PC users.

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:18.480
And I guess if you are on Stadia, like me, you don't have to wait

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:19.840
for a patch, it just happens.

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:21.560
Magic.

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:28.480
Oh, I still have my moments of giggle when Tuesdays and Steam goes down for

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.200
maintenance just for Dead by Daylight.

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:31.600
And I'm like, I'm playing right now.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:32.840
Oh yeah.

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:34.520
Is it harder to get in a match though?

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:35.760
I guess you still have all the console people.

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:36.560
No.

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:37.280
Yeah.

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.000
And there are other Stadia, you know, gamers out there.

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:42.000
Not just me.

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:43.120
Yeah.

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:43.880
It's yeah.

01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:46.480
Mostly I get into matches against, uh, console players.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.760
It is definitely a drinking game though.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:52.280
When you see it, what is this food that Alan is offering me off camera?

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.840
These are these, these chips you were talking about earlier.

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:55.720
Okay.

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:58.160
Wait, can you, can you lean in the mic and say what this is?

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.000
Yes.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:00.840
Pajama pants on it.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:05.600
Well, you gotta lean in there and say, you know, chip.

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:08.600
There.

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:11.080
They can't hear you.

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.000
You're under the noise gate.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:12.800
You gotta get a lot closer.

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.000
Oh, the tips are made of meat.

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.760
They're keto chips, protein, and they're very thinly sliced.

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:19.320
Yum.

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:20.440
Yes.

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:23.520
Meat's good.

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.760
That's not the worst thing I've ever had.

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:30.520
I was expecting it worse, but I wouldn't want to like eat an entire bag of those,

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:31.360
but I guess that's the point.

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:32.880
Anyway.

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:34.480
Sorry about that.

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:36.880
Microwave bacon enough and it'll become chip like.

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.400
Oh, that's a horrible aftertaste though.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:39.920
Blah.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.920
Uh, DJ Rama says, is that Alan or evil Alan?

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:43.120
Okay.

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.720
So for those on the podcast, Alan has a very full beard right now and it's something

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.360
his hairstylist talked him into doing.

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.920
And it is, it is a very, it is a lovely beard.

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:57.400
Um, so it's, it's something he's, I will be losing my beard in the next, uh, probably

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:57.960
next week.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:58.800
I will not have it.

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.600
So my suspicion I believe is correct.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.600
So what's that?

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.200
My suspicion I believe is correct.

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:06.400
Potentially.

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.160
I'll text you.

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.360
So, okay.

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:09.560
All right.

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:12.560
But, uh, yeah, my, I'm going to be losing my beard for about a month.

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:14.240
All right.

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:19.680
Um, moving on, let's, uh, travel around the world and check out some, we get both

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:20.400
your stories, dark soccer.

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:20.840
I'm sorry.

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:21.680
Yeah.

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:22.120
Okay.

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.400
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.240
Starting in the U S all right.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:32.520
So we've got spell force three re-forced on PlayStation four, PlayStation five,

01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:39.760
Xbox one, Xbox series, uh, dot hack GU last recode on Nintendo switch, Aztec

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:44.320
forgotten gods on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:49.400
one and Xbox series, chocobo GP on Nintendo switch.

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:54.760
And I can't pronounce this one, but we're going to try.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:40:01.240
Uh, it's looks like, uh, don't use say bang in summer on PC.

01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:05.280
And then of course, WWE two K 22.

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.160
Hopefully this one doesn't suck on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:10.840
five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.240
That's seriously this subtitle on it that I added.

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:16.640
All right.

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.480
Uh, let's go to Japan right now.

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.160
Get in the plane.

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.400
Um, on the Nintendo switch this week in Japan.

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.560
Oh, this is exciting.

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:29.400
Dot hack GU last recode is out on the switch this week.

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:34.840
Is this the, is this a remake of like the whole, or is this just one of the games?

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:40.080
Uh, it is four parts from volumes one to volume four rebirth,

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:42.000
reminisce, redemption, and reconnection.

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:43.000
Okay.

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:49.600
So that is out, uh, this week in Japan on the 10th, uh, on Mario day, uh, also coming

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:53.480
out on the Nintendo switch this week, chocobo GP a Yay.

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:54.440
I'm excited to play that.

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:55.080
That's for sure.

01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.960
Um, hopefully it's not too micro.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:02.440
As you know, square Enix is in hot water right now for microtransactions, because

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.160
apparently that Babylon's fall game.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.760
We didn't talk a lot about that.

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:13.520
Babylon's fall game is apparently flopped fucking hard because, uh, steam

01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:17.040
is only showing that like a thousand people were playing it at its peak.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.360
And that's barely Babylon's fall.

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:19.840
Yeah.

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:20.720
Babylon's fall.

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:24.600
Uh, is that, uh, that is the game that square Enix made with platinum

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.960
games, uh, it was also in the news because it was reusing some of the

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:32.640
assets from final fantasy 14, uh, there it's, it seems like it's like, it's

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:35.800
this full price game and it's like a micro microtransaction paradise.

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:38.880
Apparently, but a lot of people were looking forward to platinum and

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.080
square Enix getting together.

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:41.840
And apparently it is not worth the wait.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.640
Um, it is very obviously shoehorned full of microtransactions and quite frankly

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.120
probably should have been play.

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.040
Um, so anyway, uh, yeah.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.480
Some folks in chat quest buster says, Oh no, Babylon's fall.

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:56.320
Uh, orange.

01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:56.560
Right.

01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.920
Says Babylon's fail indeed.

01:41:59.440 --> 01:41:59.920
Or no.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:00.920
Oh no.

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:01.920
It says Babylon's fall.

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.240
Indeed.

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:05.480
I read that like Babylon's fail, but that's almost even better.

01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:05.800
Orange.

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:05.960
Right.

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:06.920
I made your comment better.

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.560
See you in the intro tonight.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:10.720
I said Babylon's flop.

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:12.400
I should have done Babylon fail.

01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:13.720
Oh, there's always next week.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:14.120
All right.

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:17.120
Uh, let's see what else do we want to do for release dates?

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:17.440
Oh yes.

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.200
Back to Japan.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:18.560
Sorry.

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:21.320
Let's talk about the games coming out next week and on the PlayStation

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:25.920
five, uh, the medium gets a Japanese release on the PlayStation five.

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:29.960
I believe that was exclusive to series X on the U S so that probably

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:34.480
explains that and then a sass is creed Valhalla, the Ragnarok edition is out

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.680
on the PlayStation five this week.

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.000
Can a dark Sakura.

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:40.440
What do you have?

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:47.200
So we have, uh, coming out, we have on the eighth for PlayStation and

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:50.280
Xbox, we have WWE, two K 22 deluxe edition.

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:54.280
On the 10th for the same, we have assassin's creed Valhalla, Donna

01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:59.520
Ragnarok, we have also on the 10th chocobo GP for the switch.

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.840
Um, the rest of these are on the 11th.

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:07.080
We have road redemption for PlayStation hotel, Transylvania, scary

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.280
tales adventure for the big three.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:13.920
W W E E two K 22 for PlayStation, Xbox.

01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:18.800
Hula on, uh, March 11th again for PlayStation and switch.

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:20.480
And that will do it.

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.120
All right.

01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:25.800
We just have a few more stories for you guys, and then we're

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:27.600
going to get to some emails.

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:31.480
I know we have at least one email tonight and, uh, we will have maybe some calls.

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.480
We'll see what happens there.

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:38.120
So, uh, in the meantime, let's get to our next story.

01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:39.520
Yeah, I believe it.

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:45.120
So, so Sony, um, is basically, or Sony air active entertainment.

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:49.600
Japan has announced that they're going to be ending support or after

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.360
sales support, so the repairs refurbishment of anything, uh, PlayStation

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:59.880
three hardware peripherals as of April 30th, 2022, they're citing that it's

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:04.280
due to the lack of parts and their inventory, and they'll no longer be

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:10.160
able to provide those services after, um, that date, of course, I'm sure

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:12.760
there's aftermarket stuff that you could do to fix your consoles if you

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:16.800
need to, but, uh, Sony themselves will not be supporting the PlayStation

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:19.000
three any longer, which I mean, it makes sense.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.040
It's been out of circulation for quite a while now.

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.800
So not surprised.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.280
Um, yeah.

01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:32.160
All right.

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:37.280
So, I mean, it seems like Tony's just been trying to slowly get the PlayStation

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.400
three and the PlayStation Vita, like outside of the, like, you know, slowly

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.960
getting it out, um, but, uh, and this kind of goes right along with that.

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:49.760
How long until they officially try to shut down the stores again

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:51.800
online and not get no idea.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:55.440
All right.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.400
Uh, well, something I think we're a little more excited about, at least

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.560
I I'm, I I'm interested in this dark soccer.

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.680
I imagine you have to be right.

01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:04.880
Oh yeah.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.960
Um, so, uh, all right.

01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:10.480
I have, I have to, I have to phrase this in one particular way.

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:11.400
I'm getting this.

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:13.280
We're starting off with that.

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.280
It will happen.

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:17.360
And I'll tell you how I heard about it was watching one of

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:20.320
polyester's, uh, YouTube, uh, things.

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:24.360
Cause usually I'll get like blood point codes from him first.

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:31.680
Um, but he talks about, um, uh, a tweet that behavior made in conjunction

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:36.520
with level 99 games, uh, which is a group that has done like video game

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:38.640
inspired board games and card games.

01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:41.200
They are doing a dead by daylight game.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.000
And, uh, there's a Kickstarter launching on March 29th.

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.960
Um, I, I am going to have this game.

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:53.480
There will be a standard edition for $49.99 with six killers and seven

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:57.840
survivors and two maps and the collector's edition with 16 killers, 17

01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:59.920
survivors and four maps for a hundred bucks.

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:05.040
Um, this is, if someone wants to get me a birthday present, by the way, you

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.720
know, this, this order is coming up for my birthday.

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:14.320
Um, and I, I imagine none of the licensed killers that, you know, DVD is known for,

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:17.000
I imagine they would have to license those separately for this.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.520
So we probably won't see any of them.

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:19.640
Yeah.

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:25.720
Like among the ones I could see, we have like a, a nurse, we have a trapper.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:31.240
We have a, a DeWitt, we have a, a Meglet, we have a Jake characters.

01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.680
You know, I'm really surprised.

01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:34.560
I know we talk about this game a lot on the show.

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:37.520
I'm sorry, but also not sorry because you know, not sorry at all.

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:38.440
It's been around a while.

01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:43.360
Um, but I'm kind of surprised they haven't tried to make, I haven't, I'm

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:46.640
surprised it hasn't gone full circle where they haven't tried to make a

01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:47.920
horror movie out of it yet.

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:52.200
I mean, maybe it would just be a very hard story to write because, um, you

01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:55.160
know, like without getting too in the weeds, I don't want to go too far into

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.160
it for the people who aren't into Dead by Daylight, but basically it's like,

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:02.920
you know, they exist in this place where they fight and fight and fight again.

01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:05.040
Basically they're for the entity's amusement.

01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:06.480
They are, you know, dying over and over.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:09.600
It's not for the, as far as I'm aware, it's not actually for the entity's

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.680
amusements, it's for the entity's nourishment.

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:12.600
Ah, okay.

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:16.800
So, well, you know, eating makes me happy, but anyway, yes, yes.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:17.920
For the entity's nourishment.

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:22.080
So, but it's just surprising that there is, hasn't been a movie to try to, you

01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:27.720
know, to, for things to come full circle where like Dwight, Meg, Claudette, you

01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:34.280
know, the hag, the trapper, the doctor are not like horror icons in cinema as well.

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.320
I'm really surprised that hasn't happened yet.

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:39.640
Somebody's gotta be pitching it or trying it, but it's going to take

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:41.160
the right script to make it work.

01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.320
Because again, I don't know how it works as a movie.

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:47.400
I'll tell you what though, and it's a long read.

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:47.680
Okay.

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:49.880
It is a long and glorious read.

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:55.120
It's like a 70 chapter fanfic that I found and read to its completion because

01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:01.960
it was as good as any novel that I have read, amazing writing, um, all of the

01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:05.960
characters were very fleshed out, you know, very headcanony, um, and there's

01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:11.680
one thing that, that I like good fanfiction, I'm a fanfic writer myself.

01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:16.320
Um, there's one thing that is in lore that never made sense to me, and that's

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:21.480
that the survivors forget everything after they've come out of a match, but

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:27.040
yet they, they're talking about having been in their matches and, and things.

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:32.920
So that's sort of like a inconsistency in lore, but, uh, I'll have to find this

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:36.040
story, I'm going to have to put it somewhere for people to read because

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:40.680
it is absolutely amazing, and if somebody wants like their ultimate

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:44.480
Dead by Daylight story, you need to read this one, it's really good.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:50.200
So, um, at any rate, I was gonna say, Tiger Claw in Chat asks, the question

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.120
is, will the movie version be any good?

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:56.040
Well, if the track record for video game movies tells us anything,

01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:57.480
the answer is probably not.

01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.560
Um, although I guess recent, recently they've been getting better.

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:03.160
I mean, a lot of people enjoyed the Sonic movie, the new Mortal

01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:06.960
Combat apparently didn't suck, you know, apparently they're getting better.

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.800
Um, but they still got a ways to go.

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:15.800
Well, I think, I think that's entirely possible for like, if it were me, I

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:21.920
would actually budget for a trilogy and have like different aspects, like be,

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.880
you know, the, like the first movie, the first main four, and maybe the

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.440
first three original killers.

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:28.920
What was it?

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:31.880
Trapper Billy and, uh, Wraith?

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:33.280
Yeah, Trapper Billy and Wraith.

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:36.160
Maybe throw Sally in there cause she was the fourth, the nurse.

01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:41.880
And have it be like their interaction, you know, stuff like that.

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:45.040
Like I'd even like throw in stuff from the killer's perspective.

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:48.320
Like they're like, maybe they were tricked into doing it or forced into

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.320
doing it or have no choice but to do it or they get punished or something like that.

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:55.400
And then the second one, move on to like a different DLC group, you know,

01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:00.320
bring in like Kate and, and the clown and, you know, clown would be creepy

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:03.280
as fuck in a movie, nevermind, um, but do something like that.

01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:06.960
Like I would, I would watch it, even if it's not great, I would probably

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.960
still watch it cause I mean, you know, the kind of shit movies I like.

01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.440
And also most horror movies.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:14.680
And I, I say, you know, you all know how I feel about gore and stuff like that,

01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:20.240
but even like the most horror movies aren't great there, but they're

01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:21.920
comfort food for a lot of people.

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:24.240
And as I'm getting to know more and more people in the community and

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:25.680
it's, it's, it's comfort food.

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:27.800
It's not great necessarily.

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.280
Like, like most comfort food.

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:31.080
Um, let's see.

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.640
Um, and Tiger Claw to answer your question, there's not really a main

01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:36.280
character, although people will say Dwight.

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:40.880
Um, it's, it doesn't really have a major narrative.

01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:44.840
Some of the lore is really inconsistent with itself and like for the ones

01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:49.960
that borrow from franchises, those, actually, I'll take that back.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.960
Most of the, most of those actually had to have some rewriting done to them.

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:57.760
Um, although, uh, the pig from Saw, her stuff is actually pretty consistent.

01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:04.240
And, um, the Sadako one is actually official, officially recognized, uh, by

01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:10.600
the, the, the owner of, of the whole Ringu franchise, including making Yoichi,

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:16.440
who was a kid in the first two movies, uh, actually making his adulthood story canon.

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:22.840
For, so Sadako and Yoichi in Dead by Daylight is canon for the

01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:23.960
Ringu universe.

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:26.760
They, they really, and, you know, again, I know we talk a lot about this game,

01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:30.200
but they, they really went out of their way to make Sadako work in Dead by

01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:34.280
Daylight too, because they, they made the care to believe Sadako doesn't

01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:38.760
kill anyone by her own hand and they really, they really went out of their

01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:42.120
way with the graphics and everything to make it so that she's using psychic

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:44.320
abilities, everything she does is psychic abilities.

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:50.320
That was actually a, um, uh, a requirement put out by, was it Kodansha?

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:51.760
I think it was Kodansha or Kadokawa.

01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:52.960
I have to look them up again.

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:55.960
Um, but it was actually a requirement of the company

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.160
that she not touch anybody.

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:05.760
Um, so that led to that, that the TVs be present, that the, the tape be included

01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:09.280
in it, that, you know, her story involved, you know, water for some reason.

01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:12.320
Well, I mean, I know why it involved water, but that's going back to the story.

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:15.760
Um, there is actually one other little bit of Dead by Daylight news.

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:16.800
Okay.

01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:17.200
Quickly.

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:18.160
All right.

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:25.120
They, um, according to DBD leaks, um, they have, uh, uh, trademarked, hooked

01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:27.840
on you a Dead by Daylight dating sim.

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:30.680
Is this, I thought I just wrote that off as bullshit.

01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:31.520
This is real.

01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:32.720
This is real.

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.960
It maybe it's gotta be an April fool's prank in the game.

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:37.320
It's gotta be.

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.760
This was on February 21st.

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:40.760
Oh Lord.

01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:41.840
It's gotta be a tome.

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:43.160
Gonna be a prank.

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:44.520
Um, all right.

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.840
Filed on February 16th, 2022.

01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:50.200
This is computer video game, combat discards, your blah, blah, blah.

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.120
Mobile device possibly.

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:57.680
Um, but this is, uh, actually saying a downloadable computer software for

01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:59.640
mobile phone games for playing video games.

01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:03.320
This is actually registered as a full game.

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.480
Let me Loki.

01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.040
I know you don't follow dead by daylight.

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.840
So let me try to explain this to you.

01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:11.560
Just how horny most of the DBD community is.

01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:13.120
Oh, we got some thirsty people.

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.480
So internet community, horny.

01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:21.800
Anytime, anytime the official DBD makes a post, the first reply, the top

01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:23.840
reply will always inevitably be B.

01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:26.760
When are you adding sex to death by daylight?

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:32.520
Or people saying in order to die in a horror movie, you have to have sex first.

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:35.120
When will Dwight and David be able to have sex?

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:38.360
Always.

01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:40.760
Always.

01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:43.400
And then look at the fan art.

01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:45.000
I'm not even going to go there.

01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:48.640
The fan art there's, there's choices.

01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:51.000
There's some choices that people are making in the fan art.

01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:51.440
Okay.

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:51.840
Anyway.

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:56.120
Um, I do want to say real quick, because going back to video game movies,

01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.560
tiger claw reminded me, Oh yeah.

01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:01.080
One just came out completely.

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:02.840
Didn't even notice for me.

01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:04.760
And the uncharted movie.

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:05.280
Hello.

01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:06.640
Did y'all know?

01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:08.320
And yeah, right.

01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:09.840
I was like, Oh, I knew it came out.

01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:11.120
I had no interest in it.

01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:11.880
Yeah.

01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:13.120
They did do an uncharted movie.

01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:13.800
Didn't they?

01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:16.080
All right.

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:17.800
All right.

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:18.520
Let's move on.

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:19.160
Let's move on.

01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:22.200
Uh, if you dated Sally, would she be into asphyxiation?

01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:23.880
Oh no, don't stop.

01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:24.160
All right.

01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:26.080
Uh, moving on Loki.

01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:32.120
So Tokyo game show this year is actually going to be returning as a physical event.

01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:39.240
Um, I guess it, you know, events are starting to go physical again because

01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:44.200
you know, it's starting to become, you know, an endemic, I guess.

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:49.240
Uh, you know, over the two years, they say of various fun events

01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:52.320
disappeared from our daily lives, but games still lighten up our days.

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:56.120
Games will continue to brighten up days of everybody now and forever

01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:00.760
until they die from COVID, uh, theme implies such strong determination.

01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:04.920
Um, unprecedented excitement is always born out of something

01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:05.960
you have never imagined.

01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:11.280
This is a whole bunch of fluff and nothing stops game except for death.

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:12.560
And then, uh, yeah.

01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:18.400
So I, they're going to be, I went to a big event in 2021.

01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:22.160
It had precautions and I think if they have, I mean, I don't

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:23.400
know what the precautions are.

01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:27.160
So until I hear them, I can understand, but if they have precautions,

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:29.320
I think it'll be all right.

01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:32.560
I don't, it's not going to, they don't outline any precautions so far.

01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:35.600
So, and everybody, everybody has to assess their own risk in that regard.

01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:36.200
Yeah.

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.200
Um, but I'm not surprised that it's, I mean, it's going to eventually happen.

01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:46.440
Cause this is well, but also this, I mean, this is way out in what?

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:49.560
October, November, October is just Tokyo game show, right?

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:49.800
Yeah.

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:50.960
It's September, October.

01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:55.760
I mean, they, they, we don't know if another variant will show up.

01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:57.760
I mean, let's fucking hope not.

01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:02.240
And a lot of scientists seem to think that if a variant shows up, it's going

01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:07.040
to trend the way Omicron did, where it's more transmissible, less dangerous.

01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:09.400
Um, hopefully fingers crossed.

01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:14.520
But again, we don't fucking know until it shows up because they say it might go

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:16.320
that way, but it could go the other way.

01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:18.360
So we'll see.

01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:21.480
Um, so who knows what happens before September.

01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:25.120
And you know, as somebody who would like to get back to doing some of these

01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:28.320
events, again, I'm happy to wear a mask more than happy to get the shot, get

01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:31.280
vaccinated, love to see everyone around me and be that way as well.

01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:33.600
I'm happy to take precautions, precautions work.

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:39.360
Um, I just, I, I, some of this coming back will be nice, but again, if

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:42.640
another variant shows up, I expect it to all go away like that if it's

01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:45.000
worse, which would be a bummer.

01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:50.440
But yeah, it's sure with everything else going on in the world, the focus

01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:52.920
sure fell off COVID real quick, didn't it?

01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:55.320
It's just interesting.

01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:57.920
I mean, I get it, but it is interesting.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:56:59.920
All right, moving on.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.120
Uh, I have one more story before we get to the listener round table.

01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:06.880
And that has to do with a very, and it's something Jason referenced in the intro

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:10.880
about, uh, an interesting little story here with a missing game award for the

01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:17.240
game Celeste, of course, Celeste came out in 2018 and won two awards at the game

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:20.520
awards games for impact and best independent game.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.760
Uh, and many people are still experiencing this game for the first

01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:27.120
time now that's what four years later, because, you know, Microsoft game pass,

01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:31.040
or just, you know, uh, it shows up a lot in these indie bundles and so forth.

01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:37.200
Um, apparently though the developer of the game, extremely okay games, never

01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:39.480
received one of the physical awards.

01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:40.360
It went missing.

01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:46.280
Um, apparently, uh, there was going scouring on the internet about trying

01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:50.480
to find a replica of the game board trophies, and there was a listing on

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:53.160
eBay and it was a real award.

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:57.120
So this streamer prestige is key.

01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:01.920
Who's a YouTube streamer actually bid on the item and won it.

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:09.240
And when they got it, they saw that, Oh, this is the missing Celeste 2018 award.

01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:13.000
And so he set it back basically.

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:17.400
Um, when he asked the seller where it came from, they didn't really get an answer

01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:19.840
other than just liquidation sources.

01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:24.240
That almost sounds like a pawn shop or something like a pawn shop could

01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:26.040
sell it, so they put it on eBay.

01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:29.560
I don't know, but I'm making it up a little bit, but it definitely sounds like

01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.240
somebody else offloaded this somewhere.

01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:35.840
Um, so yeah, I thought that was, uh, I thought that was interesting.

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:39.240
Uh, after figuring out that, or after prestige figured out that

01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:41.040
this was actually a real award.

01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:45.200
He got in touch with the studio and got it back with it, but got it back to them

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:50.800
in exchange, extremely okay, sent some signed copies of Celeste and reimbursed

01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:52.760
for the auction and shipping costs.

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:57.280
So that's very nice of them to reimburse after doing that nice gesture there.

01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.160
So it is a nice little feel good story to end on.

01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:02.160
Although of course it also begs the question.

01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:02.320
Yeah.

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:03.560
Like tiger class doesn't chat.

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:05.800
How the hell did it get lost in the first place?

01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:09.480
Well, you know, when you get an award at these types of things, like the

01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:14.280
Oscars, I think are like this, the Oscars may actually be different, but

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:19.800
most award shows when you get a trophy, you're accepting a fake statue.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.600
It's a statue, but it's unengraved.

01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:28.120
So when you go backstage, You hand the statue back over to the handler who ends

01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:32.520
up reusing it with every person that cycles through the stage, because you get

01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:36.960
a real one in the mail or some other type of delivery method, you know, signed

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:42.160
for FedEx, you get a real one that's engraved and has all your information

01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:47.480
on it that actually says best podcast, orange lounge radio engraved on it.

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:53.320
Although actually, funny enough, the podcast awards back in 2006, when we

01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:58.080
won our podcast award, when grandma and grandpa won podcast awards, uh, it was

01:59:58.080 --> 01:59:59.360
already engraved, wasn't it?

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:01.160
Dark Sakura with our name.

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:01.400
Yeah.

02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:01.960
Yeah.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
So sometimes they do it all in advance.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.400
It just depends on the award show, but the Oscars, I mean, the award we got

02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:12.080
was, was not expensive.

02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:12.400
Okay.

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:16.160
But it was, Hey, we appreciate it all the same, but we know it was a low

02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:17.800
budget award and that's fine.

02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:22.680
Uh, but for the Oscars, which are like solid fucking gold, they

02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:23.560
send those out to be.

02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:28.320
So I think this is, I think this is similar to what the game award, uh,

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:31.680
E3VL says, why don't they just give them the real one when they accept the award?

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.800
Um, a variety of reasons.

02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:36.080
I think getting lost amongst the evening.

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:42.280
Cause think about, think about the outfits that lady Gaga wears to the

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:45.840
Oscars, where is she going to put a fucking statue?

02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:47.840
Well, she won't this year.

02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:48.640
Ouch.

02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:52.360
But when she wins best song, where does she put that

02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:54.280
fucking statue in her purse?

02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:56.240
Like where did she put it?

02:00:56.240 --> 02:00:57.600
It's a placeholder statue.

02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:58.040
Yeah.

02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:01.920
So there's, I think logistically, there's a lot of reasons they do it that way.

02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:07.600
And just, you know, but, but, um, I think that's also, they want to keep, keep it a

02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:08.080
secret.

02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:13.080
If they engrave all the awards, they know who the person who engraved it knows who

02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:17.320
won, somebody who transports it to the venue knows who won and they

02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:19.320
make a big deal at the Oscars.

02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:20.840
They always show at the Oscars.

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:24.760
Here's the two people from prime and Westing, whatever that name of that

02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:28.920
company is that does all the tabulation, Westinghouse, here are the only two

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:32.840
people in the world that know who won the Oscars because they did the tabulation.

02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:34.840
It's all part of that basically.

02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:39.600
So, uh, fifth dream says the real Oscars are DLC.

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:42.400
You get them once the show is finished to avoid crunch.

02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:43.480
Sure.

02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:45.640
We're the friends we made along the way.

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:49.960
We'll use that story here at orange launch radio.

02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:50.560
Yes, we will.

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:51.720
All right.

02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:55.000

I know where there's at least one.

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:13.920
It's a long one, but a good one.

02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:14.200
Yeah.

Participate at orange launch radio.com.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:17.840
Hello, LR.

02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:19.480
Congrats on the new dig.

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:23.240
Sorry, but I just had to write in following last week's episode, you

02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:26.840
mentioned Tempest 4,000 re-releasing on Switch in about two weeks, and I'm glad

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:27.280
you did.

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:32.640
It's the latest and quite possibly the last in Jeff Mintner's, uh, long running

02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:35.360
series of really cool and trippy Tempest remakes.

02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:39.480
The first of these was Tempest 2000 on Jaguar dating all the way back to 1994.

02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:39.760
Wow.

02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:41.040
That's over 25 years ago.

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:44.800
Uh, Tempest, uh, I lost my place.

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:49.560
Uh, Tempest 3000 was actually released on the short lived Nuon platform.

02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:50.560
That's right on Nuon.

02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:55.800
Nuon was technology that included Samsung and Toshiba DVD players that expanded the

02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:57.600
feature set, but also supported gaming.

02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:59.560
I did play on one of those, by the way.

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:00.880
So I have played Tempest 3000.

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.520
Do not forget Tempest 2000 also came out on Sega Saturn, which is copy I have.

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:07.600
So back, back to the email.

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:14.680
Um, let's see, uh, but in 2000 and 2001, only four movies and eight games were ever

02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:17.400
released for the platform and nothing else shipped after that.

02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:19.760
Tempest 3000 was never ported to another platform.

02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:25.760
And this concept was not seen again until 2014 when Llamasoft released TXK on

02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:28.960
PlayStation Vita, which I have on PlayStation TV, and it is lots of fun.

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:33.240
Um, this is the game that would have released on the Switch, if not for the

02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:36.920
fact that Atari threatened legal action, barring Mintner from releasing the game

02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:41.480
on any other platforms, but to everyone's surprise, a remixed version of TXK

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:44.720
resurfaced in 2018, as you guessed it, Tempest 4000.

02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:48.920
Llamasoft developed it and Atari released it to PS4 and Xbox.

02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:53.840
As someone who has played a bit of both games, I must admit, I prefer TXK.

02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:56.480
The difficulty ramps up more smoothly and the game is easier

02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:57.960
overall than Tempest 4000.

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:01.760
So if you still have a Vita kicking around, I would highly recommend that

02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:03.840
you grab a TXK while you still can.

02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:07.400
The other tragedy is that TXK was supposed to have a VR mode when

02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:11.080
it was released on PS4, but Atari opted not to include it in Tempest 4000.

02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:14.200
So for your Llamasoft PSVR fix, you'll have to play

02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:15.960
Polybius or Moose Life instead.

02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:17.040
Yeah.

02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:21.680
And also it is, I believe still available for PSTV, just throwing that out there.

02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:27.120
Um, and then now that like YYR and by the hello, now that YYR spelled that out,

02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:30.960
I'm like, oh, I do remember talking about this on the show in stages

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:33.480
because I remember that whole lawsuit thing that was going on.

02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:37.480
So thank you for like writing the book report summary, cliff note version of that.

02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:39.800
So thank you for, for like aligning us there.

02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:43.040
But do you remember when I had my footage of playing

02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:44.880
Tempest 3000 at Atari party?

02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:46.400
Oh yeah.

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:47.560
I miss Atari party.

02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:49.920
I know that guy moved and obviously the, the, well,

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:54.040
actually I think that Dan and one other person was left in

02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:55.800
charge of the Atari party name.

02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:59.960
Oh, it's just a matter of getting everything arranged for it.

02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:01.560
I'm sure the pandemic didn't help.

02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:02.960
No, it did not.

02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:07.400
But, um, but I think Atari party could come back to saying,

02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:09.760
I'm just, I'm just going to throw it out there.

02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:11.800
I, and I, I haven't talked to Bobby about this.

02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:13.320
I'm going to put my foot in my mouth big time.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.880
Bog network presents Atari party.

02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:20.480
I would just saying I, we could talk and maybe make some things happen.

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:20.920
We'll see.

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:21.960
Let me tell it to Dan.

02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:22.400
Okay.

02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:23.680
Okay.

02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:25.440
You heard it here first.

02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:27.680
Maybe, maybe I might, I might.

02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:30.760
I might've just put myself in a lot of trouble, but we'll see.

02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:31.160
Cause I,

02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:32.840
let me finish the email cause it's long.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.760
Everybody's asking when's OLR Cod?

02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:35.560
When's OLR Cod?

02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:37.800
Well, maybe there's the email.

02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:38.200
Oh, shut up.

02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:38.520
Sorry.

02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:41.800
The classic game of the week was Metroid fusion.

02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:44.760
This game is meaningful to me in a number of, uh, in a

02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:46.160
different way than you would expect.

02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:48.480
Brace yourself for my unpopular opinion on this game.

02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:51.960
It was the greatest disappointment I'd ever experienced across 35 or so

02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:53.240
years I've been playing video games.

02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:55.840
Hear me out besides the great action and tight controls.

02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:59.480
The main reason I love the Metroid series is because it drops you into

02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:02.240
a strange and unfamiliar world than tasks you with exploring it.

02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:05.400
The quest of exploring the world, finding new abilities and figuring

02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:08.720
out how to harness those abilities to explore even more of the world.

02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:12.400
Led to some of my very favorite moments across the whole series, but Metroid

02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:13.720
fusion doesn't give you any of that.

02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:17.760
It moves in a linear fashion through one area of a space station, then to the

02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:22.360
next area, then to the next, after that, as a computer instructs you to go here,

02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:26.600
kill this, do that, the exploration is non-existent apart from finding a

02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:31.360
couple of small secret areas, and you don't even have to find the abilities

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:33.480
as they're given to you automatically when you defeat bosses.

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:37.160
Yeah, but the thing is that you're going to retrieve your stuff from these

02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:38.960
bosses, so that makes sense, but still.

02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:42.800
Uh, the high difficulty of the game comes exclusively from the fact

02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:47.080
that they do more damage to you, making the difficulty artificial.

02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:50.120
It's a decent action game, but in my humble opinion, it is

02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:51.280
not a Metroid game at all.

02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:52.800
Oh, everyone's wrong sometimes.

02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:58.200
I still never forget eagerly anticipating Metroid fusion and expecting

02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:59.640
Metroid prime to be disappointing.

02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:01.560
But then the complete opposite happened.

02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:04.680
I found Metroid fusion to be an utter disappointment and prime blew me away.

02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:08.920
So I'll close asking what is that new ultra music last week?

02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:11.840
It sounded so familiar anyway, happy gaming and enjoy your week.

02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:13.960
Embracing the popular Aaron YYR.

02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:15.960
Um, I don't remember if I said it on air.

02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:17.120
I might've said it after the show.

02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:18.400
So let me acknowledge on air.

02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:21.880
Um, DJ Roma S made us a new credit sequence, um, to just kind of go with

02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:25.960
the recent makeover here at OLR with my move, um, and, uh, decided

02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:28.360
to change up the credit music, but I'm, I'm all right with it.

02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:31.440
You know, we've been using the Corona trigger song for a long time.

02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:33.640
So, uh, the new song is the ending.

02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:36.960
It's just, it's just that simple.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.400
It is the ending to Mario brothers three, but that's why it sounds familiar.

02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:41.800
I'm sure.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:43.240
So thank you so much.

02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:44.120
Why we are for the email.

02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:44.920
Really appreciate that.

02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:49.320
And, um, in defense of YYR is opinion, although certainly everybody's entitled

02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:52.520
to their opinion on games and there's always games that like people are going

02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:56.840
to love that some of us aren't going to get, and again, I said a RE I said a

02:07:56.840 --> 02:08:02.000
recent example, uh, Elden ring, and I've even watched people play it and I'm not

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.080
looking at Elden ring going, it's a bad game.

02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:05.160
It's not a bad game.

02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:07.160
It's just not zero interest in playing it.

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:07.920
It's not for me.

02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:09.320
And that's okay.

02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:10.880
Not everything has to be about me.

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:13.680
Contrary to what people say about me behind my back.

02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:15.640
Not everything has to be about me though.

02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:16.240
Just saying.

02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:24.080
So, um, you know, that's, uh, you know, not everything, but with the Metroid

02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:28.800
thing, I'm actually gonna somewhat, I don't always agree with YYR on how he

02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:33.720
feels about this game, but this most recent Metroid game, Metroid dread.

02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:37.880
Some of these issues you raise are some things that kind of

02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:39.280
bother me about Metroid dread.

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:46.680
I don't love the chase and stealth stuff because the way I play Metroid

02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:52.200
historically has always been very slow and meticulous and exploring.

02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:57.200
So when Metroid thrust that on me, I wasn't like, it took

02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:58.480
me a minute to get used to it.

02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:04.280
I appreciate Metroid dread now, but at, in that moment I was a little

02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:09.680
thrown and I'm not sure it is like, it's it, well, it's not, it's not

02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:11.840
as good as, um, super Metroid for me.

02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:15.800
So, you know, and, and, uh, some other Metroid games as well.

02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:22.400
So just, you know, I, I just kind of say, and for, uh, uh, YYR sake, I

02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:27.560
understand why a certain change to the formula throws you off because that's

02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:29.120
what I've been experiencing with Metroid dread.

02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:31.840
All right.

02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:34.760
Anyhow, um, thank you for the email.

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:38.720
I don't see anyone in the green room, but I do see a question.

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:42.040
Um, but dark soccer, you need to go AFK.

02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:43.800
Yeah, just for a second.

02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:44.480
Okay.

02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:45.280
All right, go ahead.

02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:45.760
What's the question?

02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:46.320
Quick question.

02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:46.600
Okay.

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:50.240
This came in from Bobby Black Wolf who asks, when is your weird

02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:51.720
owl limited edition arriving?

02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:54.080
Are you in the October batch or the 2023 batch?

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:55.720
Oh, good Lord.

02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:58.400
Um, I think we're in the 2023 batch.

02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:00.720
I'll have to ask Dan real quick.

02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:03.240
Um, but I think we made it into the sec.

02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:04.080
I don't know though.

02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:09.560
Like they, like we got our pre-order and then they like didn't record it, but Dan

02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:14.680
called the company and they got our pre-order in, so I think we're in the

02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:19.440
later batch, which makes me sad inside of my heart region, but good things

02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:20.400
come to those who wait, right?

02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:22.960
No, it needs to happen now.

02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:23.720
All right.

02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:27.480
And yes, dark soccer did order that weird out table that she talked about last week

02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:29.120
on the show as we all knew she would.

02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:32.480
So it's been 13 grand, been very pinball heavy here at VOG network.

02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:35.440
Cause if you listen to Bobby Black Wolf, which I encourage you all to do, he

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:39.440
talked to last week about his new rush table, uh, that he got and putting that

02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:40.000
together.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.480
So I'm looking forward to playing that Labor Day weekend when I go out to

02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:48.320
Atlanta, uh, assuming, but, um, uh, doesn't fuck up, fuck us all up.

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:49.040
What's that?

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:53.280
You have three weeks left to play Elvira over at my place.

02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:55.040
Oh no, it's leaving.

02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:56.960
Yeah, we're giving it back.

02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:00.160
Um, so if you want to come play Elvira, come play it.

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:03.840
We're so we're, we, I think we have, uh, we're selling Mandalorian.

02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:05.840
Uh huh.

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:12.480
And, um, I think what's the, uh, I think we're selling my shows in three

02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:16.320
weeks, but I'll, I'll try to make it work because I still, I still have, um, the

02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:19.280
stuff that Loki gave me to give to you, like sitting in a box.

02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:21.280
Cause we had to move it to this house.

02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:26.480
So I think we're, I think we're selling, um, Oh gosh, not ACD stuff.

02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:31.840
Um, one of those other like heavy metal band ones, mega death or whatever.

02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:32.640
Not mega death.

02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:36.000
I can't think of it off the top of my head.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.080
Like I can see the logo and not Slayer.

02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:40.240
I know they didn't do a Slayer one, but it was like in that.

02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:44.240
No, I'll have to look, but we're selling one.

02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:47.040
Um, I remember the machine, not Metallica.

02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:49.040
It's another not Metallica.

02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:52.720
Yeah, we don't, I don't think we have Metallica anymore, but, uh, we're

02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:54.400
definitely holding on to Ghostbusters.

02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:55.600
So that's good.

02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:56.240
Iron maiden.

02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:57.440
Iron maiden.

02:11:57.440 --> 02:11:58.720
That's the one we're selling iron maiden.

02:11:59.520 --> 02:11:59.760
Yep.

02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:01.200
All right.

02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:04.640
Uh, comments and chat pod culture says voice of pinball network.

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:05.040
Yes.

02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:11.440
Sometimes, Hey, we, you all have pointed out my office has a nice space next to,

02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:14.320
um, you know, burger time there that something could go.

02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:18.240
I think we can lend you a table if you want.

02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:23.120
No getting a table upstairs would be the biggest pain in the.

02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:23.840
Oh yes.

02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:24.800
I know this very well.

02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:29.440
I, I, I do think that one of two things is going to happen.

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:33.120
The Tron machine is going to, I'm going to get that or the, um, Namco

02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:35.280
celebration one, cause I want a super pack manager.

02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:38.960
Um, but they, I think these will actually, oops, sorry.

02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:42.480
I think these will actually move into the walk-in closet and I'll

02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:44.240
have a walk-in arcade essentially.

02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:48.400
So, well, you could still, I mean, you've got a garage.

02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:51.920
We have to park cars in it.

02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:53.600
Part of our HOA.

02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:54.080
Yeah.

02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:56.080
So screw HOA.

02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:59.120
I know, but it would make sense.

02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:00.720
I explained to you off air.

02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:01.840
You kind of have to have one.

02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:06.400
Well, I'm, I'm sure it goes with any new community.

02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:07.040
Yeah, it does.

02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:08.880
All right.

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:14.720
Um, as 200 Matt says, pin cast channel reward episode win.

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:16.080
Actually you bring up a great point.

02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:21.360
We have owed this community for three or four months, orange lounge foodie-o.

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.920
So the three of us, the three of us need to get our heads together.

02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:27.200
And I think you all understand why, and thank you for being gracious and

02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:31.200
understanding why, um, mentally I was not in a place where I could do it.

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:32.160
Right.

02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.840
Well, you know, it was just badly timed.

02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:36.960
Um, I'm in a much better place now with all that.

02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:40.160
So I'm, I'm happy to do the foodie-o episode and I don't even, I don't

02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:41.200
need a guest host or anything.

02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:42.240
I mean, I'll do it.

02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:42.880
It's cool.

02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:43.840
I'll do it.

02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:44.080
Shit.

02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:44.480
Yeah.

02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:46.000
So we just need to set a date.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:50.880
So, um, and then once we get that out of the way, well, I say it like it's a,

02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:55.840
once we finally deliver on that promise because things got held up much better

02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:00.160
way of phrasing it, then we can open up the rewards again to these other fun

02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:01.120
ideas you guys have.

02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:03.680
Um, and I, I know we want to do that.

02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:05.360
We're kind of, kind of backlogged on that right now.

02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:09.680
So, uh, I will talk to my co-host off air to try to set a date for, um, orange

02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:10.960
lounge foodie-o.

02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:17.760
Speaking of dates, um, by the way, I will not be here on the, uh, on April

02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:23.440
17th for, I will be, uh, actually probably in LA at that point.

02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:25.200
Um, eating at Roscoe's.

02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:27.920
I'm going to Disneyland for my birthday.

02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:28.720
I love that.

02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:29.280
Love that for you.

02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:29.920
You can't stop me.

02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:31.360
Are you going to see?

02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:34.480
And this is a big step for me because I haven't wanted to be around like people

02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:35.440
in groups at all.

02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:38.400
Um, and hopefully Tiara will be able to meet me.

02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:39.760
I have invited them.

02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:41.600
I haven't seen them in forever.

02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:42.000
That's right.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.120
They live in Vegas now, right?

02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:44.800
You want to come for my birthday?

02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:52.240
I wish, but you can still talk to so-and-so.

02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:53.520
I'm going to table that question.

02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:55.920
I'm not going to say no, I'm going to table it.

02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:00.160
Outlook unlikely, but I kind of want to try.

02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:01.700
Okay.

02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:02.800
All right.

02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:05.280
It certainly would make affording a hotel easier.

02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:06.960
That's yeah.

02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:10.080
But I tried to get Blue Bayou and they're booked.

02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:12.160
They're like nothing good.

02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:15.840
And I'm going to be doing just Disneyland in the afternoon.

02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:16.720
Do lunch at Carthay.

02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:18.640
I can't.

02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:21.040
Um, well, no, actually I could do lunch.

02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:22.000
No, Carthay was booked.

02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:25.280
There were only like a handful of places that had any openings.

02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:28.560
So it'd have to like be put on a list to go eat there.

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:33.200
Have you talked to our gal pal Victoria about Aria snark?

02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:33.600
I haven't yet.

02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:35.360
I haven't talked to Victoria in months.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.040
Oh, okay.

02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:38.560
Would you talk to Victoria?

02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:41.680
Well, I mean, she's just an expert.

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:45.120
Yeah, no, um, I'm going through the Disney dining booking online.

02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:49.440
Uh, I don't think there's any secret tricks or anything with that.

02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:50.960
I think there's, yeah, no, there's not.

02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:54.240
I mean, there's also calling and saying it's my birthday.

02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:55.760
I want to eat there, do it.

02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:56.800
And then crying.

02:15:56.800 --> 02:15:57.520
And that might happen.

02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:02.080
Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I'm trying to figure out how I would get enough equipment

02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:04.800
into my arcade to be able to stream from there.

02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:08.160
I'd have to almost dismantle my existing setup completely.

02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:09.120
Well, here's okay.

02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:15.040
So Bobby, actually, if you really wanted to do that, I have a studio that's meant to be

02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:15.520
portable.

02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:17.760
That's now in a box.

02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:18.480
It's not.

02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:23.600
So, so the Mac mini that used to broadcast this show, it's not in the loop anymore because

02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:27.360
it didn't make sense for this virtual environment for me to just pass it to another computer.

02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:32.880
But I still have it because there's going to come a day where once again, OLR will broadcast

02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:35.680
from an expo somewhere and we can do it.

02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:38.080
So I, Oh, it's the lights and the mics.

02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:38.720
I see.

02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:40.400
Oh, I have some of that.

02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:42.080
I have the mixing board and all that, but you're right.

02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:44.560
That would get, would get a little crunchy on the space.

02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:49.920
But if, if we could do, okay, so you have to think back to when there was a Sacramento

02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:52.400
IGDA, which there is, that doesn't even exist anymore.

02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:54.160
It's Sacramento gamers collective now.

02:16:54.160 --> 02:17:00.720
But when we did the IGDA expo, you remember those shows is about 2014, 2015, somewhere

02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:00.960
in there.

02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:07.200
Um, we did, uh, that show at the, what the fuck was it called?

02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:10.640
The colony right next to the colonial theater where I do all these other shows.

02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:11.440
Yeah.

02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:12.240
I remember that.

02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:17.200
If we could broadcast a show from there, we could broadcast a show from your, your basement.

02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:22.400
That place was not a nice, Hey, I'm glad they had it.

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.840
I'm glad they got to do a thing, but you're right.

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:27.120
It was a very itty bitty space, but that's why the next, the next year they did it at

02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:30.640
the West Sacramento convention space, which was much better, much better space.

02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:34.480
Uh, GTRama S says, where did I get that gaming chair?

02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:35.360
It looks nice.

02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:35.760
Thank you.

02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:36.960
I think it's just Amazon.

02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:44.080
Um, and I say, I think because it was Alan's gaming chair and then he had the same brand.

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:44.800
He bought me.

02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:46.720
No, we did.

02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:47.280
Okay.

02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:50.400
Um, I got this one on, um, Nick's recommendation.

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:56.560
He bought me a green chair for my birthday Christmas.

02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:01.840
No, he bought me a green chair for Christmas, but the problem was green screening with it.

02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:04.000
No, it wasn't the green screen that I could deal with.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:10.160
The bottom was shaped like this, but literally my butt was too big for the chair because

02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:15.200
when I would sit in the chair, the sides would like dig into my fat fucking ass.

02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:18.000
So I couldn't like sit comfortably in that chair.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.040
The ironic thing is I've now lost almost 40 pounds since then.

02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:27.440
And so it probably wouldn't be a problem anymore, but Alan and I have already switched chairs.

02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:28.560
So I can't.

02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:30.960
Yeah, it is what it is.

02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:36.080
Um, as the show 100 Matt is suggesting for dark soccer, there's a third party Disney

02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:40.560
dining app that gets all the appointment booking data and pings you and slots open up for times.

02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:41.860
Hmm.

02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:49.120
I, oh, I know mouse weight had something kind of like that, but

02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:54.960
I'm just, I'm just, you know, I'm happy that, that I'm going to be able to go.

02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:59.200
But yeah, it's been, it's been a while cause of the pan panini.

02:18:59.200 --> 02:18:59.760
Yeah.

02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:06.400
I went, I went, um, Memorial day, the day after Memorial day in 2019, right after drag con.

02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:09.040
Well, you know, I'm never going to again.

02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:14.640
I heard, yeah, we went between Delta and Omicron.

02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:16.880
So when it was like, oh, things are getting better.

02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:17.600
And then it was site.

02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:19.920
Well, we went right in between those and we had a good time.

02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:22.800
Do you have to get tickets for galaxy's edge anymore?

02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:26.240
I believe yes for that one.

02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:26.480
Yes.

02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:29.040
But not the Spiderman ride.

02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:29.680
Fucking Nathan.

02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:30.640
I have to worry about that too.

02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:31.360
Don't quote me on that.

02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:32.720
Well, you can't get them until the day off.

02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:34.480
You just have to wake up early and do it.

02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:36.080
That part Victoria is good at.

02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:39.620
All right.

02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:44.160
I'm going to have to double check the stuff behind that, but at any rate, yeah.

02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:45.360
All right.

02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:49.680
I think with all that we are, uh, to the end of our show for tonight.

02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:51.200
Thank you all so much for listening.

02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:51.680
Of course.

02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:56.240
Uh, hopefully the sounds getting better as we get used to this new and improved setup

02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:57.120
and there's more to come.

02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:58.960
I still have so much I want to build in this room.

02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:00.880
It's just going to expand.

02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:05.040
I want to thank everybody for tuning in tonight, whether you were here live with us on Twitch

02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:07.120
or you were tuned into the podcast feed.

02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:09.280
Thank you for being a part of orange launch radio this week.

02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:13.760
I hope you all have a great week ahead, uh, with whatever you're doing this week, whether

02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:15.760
it be gaming, uh, getting ready for St.

02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:19.440
Patrick's day, which I guess is in two weeks, uh, or whatever, whatever it is you're doing.

02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:21.040
I hope you all are having a wonderful week.

02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:23.760
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, tell a friend or two

02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:24.560
about the show.

02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:27.760
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:28.800
need more voices here.

02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:31.360
Participating with our show, a nice five star review.

02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:35.360
Wherever you found this show, iTunes, Spotify, Google podcasts, wherever it is, you found

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:35.920
the show.

02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:39.200
A nice five star review goes an awful long way as well.

02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:44.640
Um, don't forget to join our discord vog at network.com slash discord and continue the

02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:49.120

there, um, participating along with that.

02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:53.840
We will wrap it up.

02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:58.240
I believe dark soccer as usual is, uh, going to her post-show killing spree.

02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:00.640
Uh, so I will let you go first with your final thought.

02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:05.360
Um, um, words, things.

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:06.800
Yeah.

02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:09.040
All right.

02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:10.640
And on that note, have a great stream.

02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:13.760
All right.

02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:15.680
And, uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:20.640
I get my new computer tomorrow or hopefully it's been fixed.

02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:21.760
Well, it was fixed.

02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:29.840
Um, ended up being some cables disconnected and apparently hooked up incorrectly somehow.

02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:33.280
So the repair shop was able to take care of it though.

02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:38.240
Um, Alan and I are getting some money back from the house on something we overpaid on.

02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:40.880
So we're looking at maybe money in our computer.

02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:42.640
So that'll be very nice.

02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:44.480
I'm ready for an upgrade though.

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:46.720
And now those things will directly benefit OLR as well.

02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:48.740
All right.

02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:51.700
Um, that is it.

02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:52.580
My final thought.

02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:57.460
I don't have a lot, just, you know, the, the work is never done here with unpacking.

02:21:57.460 --> 02:21:59.940
Um, but also just a lot more exciting stuff to come.

02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:03.540
I'm really hoping maybe in the next week, Alan and I can stream together because that's

02:22:03.540 --> 02:22:06.820
something we've been promising for a while is the two of us streaming at the same time.

02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:10.180
Now that we're no longer in the same room and we have the bandwidth for it, it's possible.

02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:10.900
So that's exciting.

02:22:11.540 --> 02:22:12.340
Frost.

02:22:12.340 --> 02:22:17.620
Um, I'll just shout out my social media, twitter.com slash M R Rob Roberts, Mr.

02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:18.580
Rob Roberts.

02:22:18.580 --> 02:22:21.620
Um, also on Twitch at just Rob Roberts.

02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:25.780
Um, thank you so much, everybody for listening to orange launch radio.

02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:26.900
I hope you have a happy week.

02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:28.260
We will see you next time.

02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:29.620
Thank you so much for being here.

02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:30.740
Good night.

02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:34.420
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
