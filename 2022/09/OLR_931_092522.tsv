0	12800	This week's axiom is Cunningham's Law, which states,
12800	16200	The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's
16200	17600	to post the wrong answer.
17600	21760	This was proven true again by game developers aplenty proving a foolhardy tweet wrong that
21760	25180	quote unquote confirmed that Grand Theft Auto 6 will look bad.
25180	26800	Too bad the game isn't done yet.
26800	29520	This is the lightest update on the latest AAA gaming bombshell.
29520	32680	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about
32680	35600	this story and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where
35600	37480	every gamer has a voice.
37480	44920	Hello my friends out there on the Internet and welcome back to another week of the show
44920	47360	where every gamer has a voice.
47360	49780	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
49780	54400	We are live once again with episode number 931.
54400	55400	That's a lot of shows.
55400	58460	For tonight, September 25th of 2022.
58460	63060	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as always by my co-hosts.
63060	67780	Say hello first off to, she's working on her TwitchCon cosplay here.
67780	70920	I would say the last minute but it isn't because there's still two weeks.
70920	79660	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers who's, who's, oh, sorry, your noise gate is unforgiving
79660	80660	sometimes.
80660	81660	Sorry.
81660	82660	How are you?
82660	83660	I'm doing all right.
83660	87100	I am recovering from a migraine and, sorry.
87100	92140	Oh, it happens, you know, but I have crackle paste.
92140	99340	I ruined the last mask I was working on so I emergency ordered another one.
99340	108260	And my foam crafting is also not going to plan so I am putting crackle paste on this
108260	111620	mask to make the Phantom of the Opera.
111620	115440	No, that would be a half mask anyway.
115480	123520	I am doing the Rift cosmetic for the pig, at least the, the crown, the reverse bear
123520	131240	trap crown with her jigsaw mask and I realized that it would be a lot easier and a lot more
131240	137520	authentic looking if I just use crackle paste and instead of painting.
137520	142560	I would hope that if you are going to cosplay at TwitchCon, you're doing something related
142560	148120	to Dead by Daylight since it is the game that really, it took you, you and Twitch's
148120	149760	relationship to the next level.
149760	152580	I would say the Dead by Daylight community.
152580	156720	You remember I had been streaming and then kind of got bullied off.
156720	162080	Yeah, which stinks, but then you found a pretty accepting community.
162080	172040	So I did and funny enough, I made a friend at the Jiffy Lube who plays Dead by Daylight.
172040	178400	He and his lady friend do and so I may have new friends to play with.
178400	179400	That's awesome.
179400	183960	I know it seems like unfortunately, because my schedule, whatever, we never seem to be
183960	188680	able to connect to play Dead by Daylight on stream, but I hope we can soon, so it'll be
188680	189680	fun.
189680	194840	I play with Phonara quite a bit, but you know, and I always enjoy playing with Phonara, but
194840	200880	I like to expand a little bit and play, you know, give my other friends a chance to enjoy
200880	201880	my presence.
201880	202880	Sure, sure.
202880	205560	I mean, humbly speaking, of course.
205560	210400	We have over in chat over at twitch.tv slash a vog network because we do tape live every
210400	214320	Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black
214320	215320	Wolf show.
215320	219480	SSJ 100 Matt is wishing you happy Jewish New Year in chat, which I know we were talking
219480	220560	about just before the show.
220560	221560	So.
221560	222560	Thank you.
222560	229620	Thank you for being here tonight in spite of that going on.
229620	231900	Can you believe the TwitchCon is just in two weeks?
231900	235700	Like I was just, you know, kind of thinking about that sales like, oh, my gosh, like,
235700	236700	I'm not ready.
236700	239420	Well, I feel like DragonCon just happened.
239420	244780	And certainly a lot of that was the coat was it did, but it was also the COVID sandbag
244780	247860	that took me out of real life for a couple of weeks.
247860	251540	And now now that things are getting up and going again, I'm like, oh, Snapple, there's
251540	253260	TwitchCon coming up in two weeks.
253260	258620	And did you get the email, by the way, that they're sending out with about your vaccination
258620	259620	and all of that?
259620	260620	Yes.
260620	261620	Everything is up today.
261620	263020	I'm getting this shit everywhere.
263020	264340	I signed up for the clear.
264340	268520	So they're using that clear service, which is you starting to see in more and more airports.
268520	269580	This is not an endorsement.
269580	270580	I've never used it.
270580	271580	I just see it all the time.
271580	273820	I didn't know they did COVID health pass stuff.
273820	278100	But apparently you can do that as well to I don't know if it's cut the line or skip
278100	282000	the line or just maybe it's like TSA pre-check, you have a shorter line.
282000	285720	So I did all that stuff today because you have to take a bunch of pictures and send
285720	286720	that all over.
287320	288520	I could do that.
288520	295540	You actually remind me that I need to update my record because I just had the newest booster.
295540	301360	And everyone, unless you have a medically mandated reason that you cannot physically
301360	305360	take the booster, I don't want to hear your excuse.
305360	306440	I don't want to hear it.
306440	307440	I want to get it.
307440	309520	I'm just trying to figure out the right time to do it.
309520	312200	So you're quoting religion to do it.
312200	319600	Don't you think that your deity of choice would want you to be healthy so that you can
319600	323400	continue to contribute to said faith?
323400	327400	Yeah, just trust all of us that have had COVID.
327400	328400	You don't want it.
328400	332800	And I'm sure at this point, I imagine more of our listeners have had it than haven't.
332800	334900	And we can also tell you that as well.
334900	341300	So anyway, I am, by the way, going to step away for a moment because this was the poorly
341300	342300	thought out idea.
342300	343300	You're fine.
343300	344300	Because I also have to introduce Techmaster Loki.
344300	345300	Hi, Loki.
345300	346300	Hello.
346300	347300	Hi.
347300	348300	How are you?
348300	349600	I'm doing fine.
349600	354820	So I notice you do have a game that plays behind you every week as we are broadcasting
354820	355820	live here on Twitch.
355820	361800	I know the podcast listeners can't see it, but I will tell them I easily know that game
361800	366900	because that is the game that I would call the it girl game of Twitch right now.
366900	371460	Because usually there's some games that will be like the it girl of Twitch for a couple
371460	372460	of weeks.
372460	375300	And I would say the last one, maybe still a little bit, was Cult of the Lamb, was very
375300	377300	much the it girl on Twitch.
377300	379800	Maybe before that, I'm trying to think of some of the other it girl games that kind
379800	380800	of like came and went.
380800	384180	Well, Disney, Dreamlight Valley, it seems like a lot of people are doing, but anyway.
384180	385180	Still the it girl.
385180	387940	You have, you are playing trombone champ.
387940	390100	I keep wanting to say trombone hero, but that isn't it.
390100	392540	It's trombone champ is actual name of it.
392540	394680	We don't want to be copyright.
394680	397040	They don't want to be in legal trouble with Activision.
397040	398040	Yes.
398040	401360	And I noticed the thing about trombone champ that's interesting is that most of the music,
401360	407880	if not all of it, is either like public domain or some sort of, you know, song that is in
407880	412640	the public consciousness where they can easily put it into the game.
412640	417080	Like there's a lot of classic songs like Beethoven, Bach, and then there's things like, you know,
417080	419840	I think Hava Nagila is one of the songs where it's things where it's like they're public
419840	420840	domain songs.
420840	421840	That's a hard one.
421840	422840	Yeah.
422840	423840	Yeah.
424000	428120	So, you know, we're longtime music game fans, and I'm sure you want to talk a little more
428120	433200	about this game during your gaming week, but what do you think it is about this game that
433200	437280	is making it the girl of Twitch right now?
437280	439920	It's not taking itself seriously.
439920	441660	For one, it's really strange.
441660	442880	It's a strange game.
442880	451800	It's kind of almost got all that, like, like it's like weird elements to it, kind of like
451800	455840	cookie clicker almost, you know, where it has like, it's like, oh, it's a game about
455840	456840	cookies.
456840	457840	Wait, now there's Eldritch demons.
457840	458840	What?
458840	459840	Yeah.
459840	460920	It's like weird stuff like that.
460920	464640	So this one, it's, it's, it's, you know, it's a trombone game with a character.
464640	467320	It looks like it could be a me.
467320	475880	And then there's also tons of baboons and the chaotic demon and it's like Dark Souls
475880	476880	is weird.
476880	480040	It's frog fractions, but it's trombones basically.
480040	488040	Kinda, not kinda, by the way, if you've never experienced the genius that is frog fractions,
488040	491640	I don't even know if the game is still up and running somewhere, but it's, I think it's,
491640	492640	it's on steam.
492640	493640	I think.
493640	494640	Oh wait.
494640	495640	Oh, that's right.
495640	496640	I think they did release on Steve.
496640	498000	So it's really one of the most incredible gaming experiences you'll ever experience
498000	499280	is frog fractions.
499280	500280	There was a sequel.
500280	504120	I sort of think at that point when you knew what the gag was, I think the sequel kind
504120	508920	of lost effectiveness, but, uh, it's, it's, it's still worth the time was that you didn't
508920	511760	know it was frog fractions too, because it was a different game.
511760	512760	Yes.
512760	515920	And that was the running gag on this show for many shows for a long time was, Oh, this
515920	517040	new weird thing.
517040	518880	Is this frog fractions too?
518880	522240	Is it, is trombone champ frogs fractions too?
522240	526880	No, it's, it's a, it's a fun yet challenging game.
526880	527880	That's for sure.
527880	530960	This isn't the first I've heard of it.
530960	533440	Oh, it's, you know what the, you know, the funny thing about it.
533440	534440	Okay.
534440	538880	So as a music game fan, the actual music game itself, this is literally theater them.
539400	541880	There's three different stage types and theater them.
541880	545560	It's not the one you see the most, but I believe this is the cut scene one where you're just
545560	551160	going up and down and tracing the note it's theater them, but it's theater them with the
551160	556520	trombone and the it's the sense of humor that makes it so that like when you miss notes,
556520	558360	it says nasty.
558360	560720	And when you, Oh, it's the battle stages says Mike Deft.
560720	563080	I thought, no, that those are the ones you commonly see.
563080	566700	This is the one, I think it's the cut scene ones, the movie stages where you are tracing
566700	568360	the note lines and everything.
568360	570120	It's really, it's the same mechanic.
570120	575240	It's just going the opposite direction, which I guess the default mode for the trombone
575240	577000	is also down as up and up as down.
577000	578000	Right.
578000	579000	Because that's the way trombone would work.
579000	580000	Yeah.
580000	581680	No, I fixed that right away.
581680	583600	But it's just, if you listen to it.
583600	585600	What about valve trombone?
585600	589320	I don't think they add any of the other mechanics and that, yeah.
589320	592600	But it's the, it's the noise that the trombone makes.
592600	596680	That's really funny when you're messing up and that's what, and the fact that they call
596680	601000	them tromboners, when you play a trombone, you're a tromboner, which isn't actually what
601000	605200	they're called, but it's, that's part, part, part of the humor in the game.
605200	608200	That's what we called them in high school.
608200	612760	I feel like the people that made this game absolutely were band nerds in the trombone
612760	613760	section.
613760	614760	Like the, and these are all in jokes.
614760	619360	It's hilarious though, is they have like trading cards you can unlock and like booster packs
619360	620360	and stuff like that.
620360	625420	But they're like of like classic trombone musicians was like, who's collecting that.
625420	626900	But it's just ridiculous.
626900	630020	So which Neville brother is in there?
630020	634380	Well, I was just, I hope you, you cannot have a ska band without a trombone.
634380	636760	Like a trombone is an essential part of any ska band.
636760	639620	So I think they do have a ska track in there.
639620	641780	I'm pretty sure there is.
641780	646620	There's also, was it that, that, that track from, um, 2001, a space odyssey?
646620	647620	Oh yeah.
647620	648620	Oh yeah.
648620	649620	Well, that's a classic.
649620	650620	Zarathustra.
650620	651620	That's a classic.
651620	652620	Yeah.
652820	657900	For the record, here's a true story about me as a band nerd.
657900	665660	I wanted to play trombone and, uh, I wasn't allowed to play trombone because apparently
665660	669300	I don't have the correct shaped mouth to play trombone.
669300	671820	So I played saxophone instead.
671820	672820	Hmm.
672820	676940	Well, I think if they make a sequel to this game, it won't be saxophone champ.
676940	678340	It'll be tuba champ.
678340	681540	It seems likely the likely sequel to this game.
681540	686620	Well, and the other thing, I still want a sax master.
686620	689500	And the other thing I want to say, and then I want to get into the news and stuff is that
689500	694100	with this game, uh, you know, I keep saying it's the girl on Twitch because it went extremely
694100	695540	viral on Twitter.
695540	699140	And I was very surprised that the people that were tweeting this, like all these verified
699140	703780	accounts, including like one of the MSNBC news anchors, like quote, tweeted it and said,
703780	705940	this is the laugh I needed today or something like that.
705940	711060	Like just the little clip of people playing the trombone horribly, I think speaks to all
711100	715180	of us that have ever joined bands successfully or otherwise.
715180	716700	So I think it does.
716700	721660	It does sound like a high school marching band, like practicing music that they are
721660	723860	not familiar with is what it sounds like.
723860	726540	Can you play it with a trombone MIDI controller?
726540	732820	No, no, because that it's, it's, I don't think it's, it's not supposed to be serious, Jamie.
732820	734820	It's a jokey kind of thing.
734820	740140	So, but it shouldn't put like, like a support in there just to be hilarious because I think
740140	741140	it would have been funny.
741140	743540	And actually it's what the modding community's for.
743540	747740	And Bobby said, so Bobby just said it in chat, not yet, but somebody's already modding it
747740	749980	in the MIDI controller because of course they are.
749980	751540	And they've already modded in other songs.
751540	752540	I'm sure.
752540	756980	I think I heard you were talking about a megalovania or whatever that song is from megalovania
756980	761460	shows up in everything, but I was thinking like, how about some early, no doubt songs
761460	765260	like back when they really were scar or some of the other like stuff from the nineties,
765260	769700	you know, boss tones, there's any pain fans.
769700	772900	I introduced you to pain a long time ago.
772900	774340	Are they even still together?
774340	775340	No.
775340	780220	Um, Everest, they have another band that's formed since then, but like pose got like
780220	782940	tenure at Georgia tech.
782940	788220	And so the band kind of fell apart and now it's like a different band, but still pain
788220	791420	is like one of the best bands to ever come out of the South.
791420	792420	All right.
792420	793420	All right.
793420	796240	Maybe they'll show up in the DLC because, Hey, this game's going to make these, these
796240	797240	folks money.
797240	799880	So maybe they'll be able to put some money down for DLC.
799880	800880	We'll see.
800880	801880	We'll see.
801880	802880	All right.
802880	803880	Anyhow, let's move on.
803880	804880	Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.
804880	807160	We actually have a lot of like Twitch related topics tonight.
807160	810200	I know it's interesting because Jamie and I are talking about Twitch con in a couple
810200	811200	of weeks.
811200	815880	Um, which, which will be the first time I've been in a long time.
815880	822280	Um, I went the very first year, you may or may not recall, um, our voiceover guy, Jason
822280	824280	took me the first year.
824280	829120	Um, and it was, uh, at the Moscone center and we only, I only went for a day.
829120	833440	Um, but that was where, you know, I, I learned a lot just walking around the show floor and
833440	836880	talking to vendors and it really was motivating to like do Twitch.
836880	843240	Um, I didn't quite stay on the wagon for a variety of reasons, but you know, a few years
843240	848020	later when the necessity of VOG, the going through changes and shout cast and all that
848020	851240	stuff, uh, kind of came up and we made the move to Twitch.
851240	853600	You know, it was, it was, I was very thankful.
853600	857480	I had experimented with Twitch before and kind of had some of that knowledge.
857480	861760	In fact, the video capture card that is still in my PC, this new PC, this day I bought
861760	863720	at that first Twitch con when I was there.
863720	866980	So it'd be interesting to see how it's evolved all these years later.
866980	871840	And now that I am a little more immersed in Twitch culture, not just through OLR, but
871840	875880	you know, through my own streaming and participation as well as dark soccer, it'll just be interesting
875880	881320	to see, you know, what this year looks like even just post pandemic, you know, so, well,
881520	885640	Well, I shouldn't say post pandemic, post lockdowns we'll say.
885640	893440	For the record, I actually have included my mask in with, uh, my, uh, what I'm calling
893440	903520	my casual cosplay, where I have a little lower face mask that's a pig going.
903520	910940	So if I need to, um, I have, I have my little pig, pig who half mask, but I'm going to make
910940	912900	this, I'm going to make my cosmetic work.
912900	913900	All right.
913900	918100	Well, we'll do more, uh, Twitch con prep next week and, and try to figure out where people
918100	919760	can find us and all that good stuff.
919760	924020	So there's a variety of meetups going on, uh, throughout the, uh, con.
924020	926420	So I'd love to meet some listeners if you're going to be there.
926420	930060	Otherwise, there's a lot of streamers that I watch that I can't wait to hang out with
930060	931060	and see.
931060	932060	So, uh, it's going to be fun.
932060	933060	My friends.
933060	934060	Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
934060	935060	It's gonna be fun.
935060	936060	Yeah.
936060	942500	And, and if any, by the way, if, if any of the friends are listening, um, I'm going to
942500	947460	be at Disneyland on the 10th and you're welcome to hang out with me.
947460	949580	I will not be going sadly, nothing, nothing.
949580	953840	I just, we, we booked a flight home on Monday and I can't miss too much work because we're
953840	957100	also going to, don't forget, we're going to Seattle just like four more weeks.
957100	963520	So it's, you know, I had reserved the time off before my schedule even changed just to
963520	964660	be sure that I got it.
964660	968780	And I'm very glad that I did because the days I scheduled off for the days, my schedule
968780	969780	changed too.
969780	970780	Nice.
970780	971780	All right, let's move on.
971780	974700	We got other stuff in gaming we want to get to Mike.
974700	980300	We want to get tonight's kickoff topic, uh, which has to do, it's a little bit with Twitch
980300	984700	culture, but I'd say this is more about the game in question, which has not been getting
984700	990220	a lot of great reviews, uh, across the board, but continues to sell like hotcakes.
990220	992740	Anyway, Loki, why don't you start us off here?
992740	994580	I mean, it's not a surprise.
994580	996580	It's the same old complaints over and over again.
996580	1001300	It's just, it's like EA is playing this game of how far can we push it before?
1001300	1003180	It's too much.
1003180	1009980	And maybe, maybe this time it was too much, but, um, so of course Madden players are upset
1009980	1018660	over the fact that, um, in game gambling nods of the ultimate team stuff is, um, basically,
1018660	1024540	I don't know if it's, um, that they don't have them in post yet.
1024540	1028260	Basically it says, uh, you know, they need better odds, uh, better re-rolls better pack
1028260	1033380	odds overall with bundles plus toppers, a hundred dollar version of promo bundles should
1033380	1039100	be enough to complete a master full legend solos reward with B and D champion fantasy
1039100	1045460	packs, at least top set pieces that can be added into sets to help NMS players.
1045460	1049260	Um, I wouldn't be spending a hundred dollars on these packs, but whatever.
1049260	1054940	Uh, so basically they're, the odds are getting harder to get, I guess, good players in those
1054940	1056020	all the team things.
1056020	1060260	So what they're doing now is announcing that they're going on pack strike, which makes
1060260	1065600	sense because a lot of these streams, a lot of them are opening these ultimate team packs.
1065600	1069480	And I mean, if you're getting like pretty bad polls, and I guess that also would impact
1069480	1074320	your, your content negatively as well, but you're also paying the money, which is kind
1074320	1076600	of perpetuating this problem in the first place.
1076600	1078720	So kind of your fault.
1078720	1083560	I mean, yeah, I was gonna say, look at Diablo immortal, like so many people were upset about
1083560	1087640	the, you know, um, microtransaction or whatever you want to call it system in that game.
1087640	1094060	Um, but because in part of all of these streamers buying into it anyway, and continuing to,
1094060	1097680	you know, we had all these stories when that game was first out about thousands of dollars
1097680	1102480	being poured into it and just encouraging others to do the same, that game is easily
1102480	1104780	in the top 10 grossing mobile games.
1104780	1105780	No problem.
1105780	1107960	So message not received.
1107960	1112280	It's not going to do anything because they've made so much money off of it at this point.
1112280	1113640	Like it's too late.
1113640	1120720	You the fact that you're still like, you know, the fact that you even considering, well,
1120720	1122560	the hundred dollar pack should be enough.
1122560	1126960	The fact that you're buying a $100 pack in this game in the first place is already a
1126960	1127960	problem.
1127960	1133560	Like, I would say yes, but I'm planning fully to drop $100 in theater them.
1133560	1136320	And I don't want to think about how much I've spent on things like that by daily.
1136320	1137920	Yeah, no, and I get that.
1137920	1143400	But this isn't like, you know, you're paying $100 in theater at them to randomly get some
1143400	1144400	songs.
1144400	1145400	I know what I'm getting.
1145400	1146400	Yeah, I know.
1146400	1147400	In both of those circumstances.
1147400	1148400	I know what I'm getting.
1148400	1151280	It's a thing of is like a collector's edition or something like that.
1151280	1152280	That would be different.
1152280	1155240	Like if Madden had like a collector's edition, right?
1155240	1160400	However stupid it would be to charge like say $120 for it or something that did have
1160400	1165560	these cards in there, but it's they already know what they can get away with.
1165560	1167440	I mean, hell, just look at the game.
1167440	1171000	I mean, they're pretty much releasing the same product every year.
1171000	1175760	They're taking features out holding them for a few years in the magical Disney vault, and
1175760	1179640	then bringing them back later on and pretending Oh, look at this new feature that you this
1179640	1180800	is why Madden is great.
1180800	1181800	It's so innovative.
1181800	1185280	And it's like this was just what you had a few years ago, except now you're calling it
1185280	1186740	something different.
1186740	1192040	So I mean, they already know their target audience just either doesn't care or is too
1192040	1193640	stupid to figure it out.
1193640	1197840	And so they are just whatever, we're gonna keep doing what we want, because you can complain
1197840	1201200	about it all you want, create your hashtags and whatnot.
1201200	1205760	It's not going to affect us in the least until it does and then they walk it back.
1205760	1209660	But that's what happened with Star Wars because that was a single player game and stuff.
1209660	1214340	But you see, whereas they walked it back loop boxes there.
1214340	1218860	They just doubled down in FIFA and Madden, because they can get away with it there.
1218860	1222860	I want to get to a couple comments from chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
1222860	1223860	So SSU 100.
1223860	1226620	Matt says it's good that the streamers are the ones striking on these.
1226620	1228740	I wonder if the youtubers will as well.
1228740	1232820	EA cares a lot about these content creators not pushing their product.
1232820	1235940	But as we know, regardless what happens, folks will still buy the loot boxes.
1235940	1239620	Yeah, I mean, and you also make a good point is I would say the strongest statement.
1239620	1244380	You could make and this also ties into what red entertainment says tracks and theater
1244380	1248820	them can last for several years, card packs and this year's model of Madden only work
1248820	1250540	with this year's model of Madden.
1250540	1254740	And in my opinion, the biggest statement these streamers could make would be, again, similar
1254740	1255740	in the Diablo universe.
1255740	1259620	You had a very large website about min maxing a max role.
1259620	1262060	It's something I've something I didn't know a lot about at the time.
1262060	1266180	But ever since I got back into Diablo three, as with Alan, like we've been using that site
1266180	1267300	a lot.
1267300	1271100	Max role pulled their coverage of Diablo immortal said, you know what, we're no longer covering
1271100	1272100	this game.
1272100	1274260	We're going to focus on Diablo two and Diablo three.
1274260	1276820	We're not going to talk about immortal anymore, basically.
1276820	1281920	And in my opinion, if the Madden streamers really want to make an impact, I would say
1281920	1284420	continue to stream Madden 22.
1284420	1288420	And don't even don't even acknowledge this new game for a variety of reasons.
1288420	1292920	You know, again, it's I don't want to just shit on a sports game for the sake of shitting
1292920	1294100	on a sports game.
1294100	1295100	Like I understand.
1295100	1300700	Well, but Darkseid, that's not fair, you know, because when they were shitting on DDR,
1300700	1302400	we had a lot to say about that, right?
1302400	1303400	Like it's whatever.
1303400	1304400	Yeah, I know.
1304400	1305400	I know.
1305400	1309620	But it but it still needs to be said, like, you know, people can have their faves and
1309620	1310620	all that.
1310620	1311620	That's fine.
1311620	1317820	But when it comes to, you know, Madden and how bad 23 appears to be, even if you're a
1317820	1321820	fan, not just with these, you know, built in issues, but just with, you know, a lot
1321820	1325000	of the whole like, it's the same stuff, but it sounds like things aren't implemented well
1325000	1331240	that why not just continue to play Madden 22 and be like, you know what, until EA you
1331240	1336560	make a game worth upgrading from, we're just going to stick with the game that works, which
1336560	1339000	for all I know, is probably not even Madden 22.
1339000	1341520	It's probably have to go back further, to be honest.
1341520	1347040	And that goes back to something that I always say is, you know, be critical of what you
1347040	1348040	love.
1348040	1349040	Yeah.
1349040	1351120	And we do that a lot here.
1351120	1358560	Just because you're complaining about your, you know, a game, it doesn't mean that you
1358560	1364560	don't love the franchise, or you know what it could be capable of, it means that you
1364560	1369320	care enough to be vocal to give some real criticism about it.
1369320	1374440	And I'm not just saying you go over the socks, and then you know, not expand upon that, but
1374440	1379160	absolutely have something that's going to back up your reasoning for your opinion.
1379160	1386520	And then the second thing about it, put action to it, nothing changes until you make it change.
1386520	1393160	And look at the boy, the boycott is the right idea.
1393160	1397800	And I mean, look at the amount of monetization they're doing in a $60 I'm actually I think
1397800	1404320	it's 60 years at $70 now I don't even know game that really should be free to play at
1404320	1405320	this point.
1405320	1406320	If that's all they're doing.
1406320	1408900	They're not updating the game at all each year there.
1408900	1410900	It's just literally a roster update.
1410900	1415480	And like I said, they've been caught even in some versions having the old assets in
1415480	1416480	the game.
1416480	1419220	Like, come on, you know,
1419220	1421580	saving money, but don't be obvious about it.
1421580	1425140	They're making billions of dollars off of this, like they're not putting any of that
1425140	1429700	money back into the franchise, it would be different if they're like monetizing the crap
1429700	1430700	out of it.
1430700	1433200	But it's just such an amazing groundbreaking game.
1433200	1434580	It's not that anymore.
1434580	1437760	It's just, they're not forced to compete.
1437760	1442620	And so the game doesn't innovate because they have the license, which this is partly NFL's
1442620	1448460	fault as well, because they're the ones not licensing it to other companies.
1448460	1454020	And so now the NFL has this crappy game that they get to put their brand on.
1454020	1455140	I mean, cool.
1455140	1461060	Mike Deft confirms $70 for man 23 on the PS five, and last gen versions are 60, which is
1461060	1462060	kind of what we seen.
1462060	1467180	I honestly, I really think, you know, but obviously EA is going to hate this idea because
1467180	1471060	it's less money for them, but I really think, you know what, put the effort into making
1471060	1477820	a solid, fun football game, and then you know what, pay $20 for the licensed annual updates
1477820	1480300	and put out a really solid game every four years.
1480300	1484020	Anyway, you're still going to make money off of all these, you know, cards and all these
1484020	1485020	other things too.
1485020	1490060	But like, why, why have this ruse of these major changes for 70 bucks?
1490060	1492980	Why not just do 20 bucks for like an expansion pack?
1492980	1504020	Why not do the dead by daylight model seriously, you know, put out a new chapter for like each,
1504020	1509460	each season with the new players or have like DLC in case they've brought in like someone
1509460	1514700	new mid season or something, you know, I don't know if people actually do that because it's
1514700	1515700	sports ball.
1515700	1516700	I don't care.
1516700	1524900	But I mean, I think that doing that way saves them a lot of time on production because then
1524900	1530500	they have their base game engine, hopefully perfected.
1530500	1531500	It's not.
1531500	1533180	It's not even close to perfect.
1533180	1534540	It's buggy as hell.
1534540	1542160	Let me finish that if they have, if they have an engine that works that they have perfected
1542160	1548560	and put that one into implementation and then just build on that, you know, you know, eventually
1548560	1553200	it is going to run to a point where they may have to update like whatever their engine
1553200	1559600	is, but that hopefully won't be for some time because you know, the, the, the engine is
1559600	1561480	going to be what runs the game.
1561480	1566900	You're just going to change the shell on top of it and maybe like every couple of years,
1566900	1573540	you know, have a, we've done this cosmetic upgrade, update your game for the, you know,
1573540	1582980	for the updated fields or crowd effects or whatever, you know, and that way it's in the
1582980	1589820	end going to save them money because they aren't going to have to work into, you know,
1589820	1596380	on the production of a brand new game that, you know, they're going to have to make all
1596380	1600540	new assets for, even though we've seen proof that they're not doing it.
1600540	1608020	They can just recycle assets that are going to, you know, if they, if they still are graphically,
1608020	1616100	you know, fine, then keep using the same assets, you know, maybe, maybe, you know, have upscale
1616100	1620220	options or something, or, you know, every few years, like I was saying with the engine,
1620220	1624740	if the engine's been updated, update the, the models as well.
1624740	1631180	And that way you can, you know, they can put more dedicated time into it, less time than
1631180	1634580	what they would do to crank out a new game every year.
1634580	1640980	And you know, also it's kinder to their employees, it's kinder to the market, put out the base
1640980	1647860	game for 20 bucks and have the updates be, you know, like do a few of them every year.
1647860	1656260	Because if people pay like, say $15 for an update and they're doing it, say three times
1656260	1662140	a year, that's $45 per person playing the game, right?
1662140	1666300	And then you put out the DLC packets, like here's your fan packet.
1666300	1672340	If you were a fan of the sea chickens or something, I called them sea chickens because Dan calls
1672340	1676540	them sea chickens, the Seahawks.
1676540	1677540	But do you see my point?
1677540	1682500	Yeah, let me, Loki, do you want to jump in or otherwise I'm gonna get to chat comments.
1682500	1686980	Oh, I was just gonna say, well, they, this is the model that they've already adapted for like,
1686980	1690820	almost everything that they have, which is basically release unfinished products,
1691380	1696260	and monetize the crap out of them, and only do something when there's massive backlash to it.
1697060	1702100	I mean, that's, look at look at Battlefield, that that series is suffering because of the way that
1702100	1703060	they treated it.
1703060	1706500	Look at Mommy Madden's just been mad and it's been suffering for years.
1706500	1707940	But same problem with FIFA too.
1707940	1712980	Like, they're fundamentally buggy as hell, and unfinished and unpolished.
1712980	1717540	And considering that they're reusing the same game over and over again, it's really weird
1717540	1720660	to see the same bugs every single year in that stuff.
1720660	1726900	Like, it's just, there's really no excuse at this point for this like kind of product,
1726900	1730100	especially with the amount of money that they have coming in.
1730100	1733860	It's not a matter of like, we don't have the funds to produce a good game.
1733860	1735300	It's just they don't care.
1735300	1737380	They're just giving it all to their shareholders.
1737380	1742500	And so like, I just don't this is why no one trusts EA to make a good game anymore.
1742500	1744980	It's just whatever it is what it is.
1744980	1746660	But used to be the company.
1748660	1752340	Let me go to chat and get some of the comments here over twitch.tv slash vog network.
1752340	1756500	So Tiger Claw and chat asks, should Madden be games as a service rather than release
1756500	1757780	new games every year?
1757780	1761060	Well, in my opinion, they're trying to monetize the game like it's both already.
1761060	1763140	And that's there in lies the problem.
1763140	1766420	They want their they're literally want their cake and eating it too.
1766420	1771460	And so I think they need to ditch the new games every year and just admit what they're
1771460	1773700	trying to do, which is the games as a service.
1773700	1776980	And that also tried to do games of the service member type was it member?
1778020	1781620	Oh, God was there I can't even remember the game because it's been blocked out of my mind.
1781620	1786020	They're stupid jetpack games as a service game that folded because it was awful.
1786660	1787460	That's not sports.
1788100	1788820	I'm talking matter.
1788820	1789460	It's EA.
1790100	1793380	Well, yeah, but I'm I'm pointing out the anthem flop for different reasons.
1793380	1795220	But anyway, that's true.
1795220	1799300	And Matt says, I will say in the sports game developers defense, the devs have a very short
1799300	1800660	window to make each year's game.
1800660	1802980	They roughly have about eight months to make a new game.
1802980	1805060	First four months are spent patching updates work.
1805060	1805700	That's exactly.
1805700	1809140	But that's exactly what I'm that's what needs to change is that that whole.
1809700	1810100	Yeah.
1810100	1813460	And that's that's the same thing I've been trying to say, too, with that whole idea about,
1813460	1813940	you know what?
1813940	1819300	Put out a new game every three years and do an expansion pack for the rosters and maybe
1819300	1824180	one or two cool new features or modes in the off years to get your money there, too, if
1824180	1824740	you must.
1824740	1830820	But this whole concept of seventy dollar games every year, like the reality is maybe you
1830820	1836660	could poop out a game in a year in the Genesis era when these games all first started to
1836660	1839780	come to, you know, a really big prominence and so forth.
1839780	1843700	But this is not a possibility in the PlayStation five era anymore.
1843700	1846020	Games are not developed the way they used to be.
1846020	1849060	At least games of this scale are not developed the way they used to be.
1849300	1850180	You know what I mean?
1850180	1853860	It might have taken one or two people to make trombone champ, but that's a different, you
1853860	1855380	know, a completely different type of game.
1855380	1860020	Well, if they're they're hell bent on putting out a game out every single year, then what
1860020	1864820	you got to do is you got to go the call of duty method where you have multiple studios
1864820	1867060	working on these games and cycling through them.
1867060	1870820	So their development time is like three years and you have three studios working on you
1870820	1872180	making billions of dollars.
1872180	1873300	You can afford it.
1873300	1876420	The thing is, they don't want to put the money into it because they're going to make those
1876420	1879540	billions of dollars, whether they put out a piece of crap or they put out a great piece
1879540	1881540	of, you know, quality content.
1881540	1888260	It's such a monetarily minimal difference in what they're going to make, you know, other
1888260	1889860	than the praise or whatnot.
1891060	1892980	They just don't care is what it is.
1893780	1897460	Well, again, the best thing you can do is vote with your wallet.
1897460	1900900	And, you know, if you don't agree with it, you've got to resist the temptation to buy
1900900	1903860	the game and especially the DLC that's within the game.
1903940	1908740	But the reality is, especially in the streaming culture, you know, people you feel that they
1908740	1911540	need to play those latest and greatest things to get those views.
1911540	1915380	And that may be true that, you know, there's lots of streamers out there.
1915380	1918660	And if you're not streaming the thing somebody wants to see, they'll go somewhere else.
1918660	1924100	But I think even we as people that consume streams have to if we believe strongly enough
1924100	1928740	that this game sucks and shouldn't be supported, the development behind it, that we have to
1928740	1930900	stop watching those types of streams.
1930900	1932740	That goes for much more than just Madden.
1932740	1936900	That also goes for something like Anthem, which was something that was up my alley.
1936900	1940420	But the issues with that game were transparent from the very beginning.
1941220	1942900	And it's really too bad.
1943620	1944820	So, all right.
1946020	1949940	Well, let's move on and talk about the games that we are enjoying in a segment called How
1949940	1950900	Is Your Gaming Week?
1950900	1953380	And so what are we supporting this week with our playtime?
1953380	1954340	We'll go to Dark Soccer.
1954340	1955220	How is your gaming week?
1955860	1957620	My gaming week was pretty fun.
1958500	1961540	I, of course, was playing Dead by Daylight.
1963220	1965860	I actually played some killer matches.
1967460	1969780	I had a factually I had a very funny thing happen.
1970580	1972100	So I made some new friends.
1972100	1974020	But let me tell you how I made my new friends.
1976900	1979860	Gwen had to sign off and we normally play together.
1979860	1981780	So I ended up playing killer.
1982340	1986740	And, you know, as I've been wanting to do lately, I've just been sort of fucking off
1986820	1990820	and letting, you know, letting survivors have a good time, you know, just trying to do my
1990820	1995460	challenges and letting people out, you know, because so many other killers are big, you
1995460	1996500	know, stink nuggets.
1998420	2002660	And then I made friends with two of the survivors in the endgame chat.
2002660	2004660	And I was like, well, hey, do you mind if I Swift with you?
2004660	2006500	And they're like, yeah, come Swift with us.
2007060	2014340	And so I played with them and then we made friends with the killer in the endgame chat
2014340	2015300	after that.
2015300	2022100	So I have started following Paisley Panda, that's Paisley with an IE, who is absolutely
2022100	2030660	a delightful non-binary Dead by Daylight killer learning huntress and absolutely fun.
2030660	2032900	But I've never had something like that happen.
2032900	2039060	And I think that it goes back to kind of my whole theory about, you know, if you have
2039060	2044420	a chance and a reason to be nice in the endgame chat, then sometimes it can work out to your
2044420	2045060	advantage.
2045060	2049300	You can make friends and, you know, and then if the person is a shit to you, then you just
2049300	2052340	make them look bad because you're a nice person and they're not.
2054580	2060180	But in this case, it was very interesting situation that happened.
2060180	2063940	I made new friends to play with and found another streamer who does some absolutely
2063940	2065060	delightful content.
2065700	2069140	And I had a good time.
2069380	2076180	Um, I'm also working on at least getting all of my survivors to prestige one.
2076180	2079220	And I'm trying to talk myself into playing Wesker.
2079220	2084180	It's just, I don't feel right playing Wesker right now with all of the fucking Weskers
2084180	2086420	that are every fucking where in the game.
2086420	2087300	I won't play him either.
2088340	2090340	Yeah, I can wait on my adapt.
2090340	2092420	I'm not, I'm not hyper about it.
2093060	2100580	Um, but, um, I've also of course been playing cult of the lamb, which is a very delightful
2100580	2101220	game.
2101220	2102020	Funny enough.
2102020	2102420	Okay.
2102420	2107140	So I didn't stream final fantasy for last night like I normally do because we looked
2107140	2114340	into tickets to see where now and we, um, we missed the chance to get the tickets in
2114340	2117460	the first place because we had already been to the tour.
2117460	2122340	It's the one where he does all of his original, like the style parodies and not the actual
2122340	2123300	parody parodies.
2124100	2128820	Um, but when we went to the first one, it was all unplugged and this one wasn't, it
2128820	2131140	was, you know, full on guitars and everything.
2131140	2131860	It was really fun.
2132580	2139780	Um, but, uh, we sat with, uh, a couple of guys and one of them had a Triforce tattoo
2139780	2141460	when we just started talking about games.
2142180	2148580	Um, and, uh, he's like, so there's this game called cult of the land.
2148580	2151540	I'm like, oh yeah, I streamed that thing on Mondays and he's like, awesome.
2152260	2155460	And then I, you know, we, we just chatted for a little bit.
2155460	2156260	Where was the show?
2156260	2157540	Is that here in SAC?
2157540	2159940	It was at the Mondavi center in Davis.
2159940	2161220	Oh, okay.
2161220	2161540	Okay.
2161540	2162500	I haven't been there in a long time.
2162500	2163940	I think I saw Margaret show there once.
2164580	2166500	You and I saw Margaret show there.
2166500	2168100	I think that was like the only time I've ever been there.
2168100	2168820	Okay, cool.
2168820	2173300	That was, I think the last time I went there and they've really built up around that.
2173300	2178980	Um, and no, uh, I haven't seen the weird Al biopic yet.
2178980	2180820	Um, but he did talk about it.
2180820	2183380	Um, and I'm looking forward to seeing it.
2183380	2186260	Of course I've seen UHF 50,000 times.
2186260	2187620	I got engaged to that movie.
2190660	2193300	But, um, I don't think the bio picks out yet.
2193300	2194260	Cause I definitely want to see that.
2194260	2195060	It's November.
2195700	2196180	Yeah.
2196180	2197620	And actually Bobby just said that.
2198500	2204100	Um, but, uh, but I'm really, I'm, I'm looking forward to that.
2204100	2206580	And of course to getting my, my pinball table.
2207140	2214420	Um, I played doctor who pinball today and actually had a very decent third ball.
2214980	2217540	Um, that game likes to drain like a bitch.
2217540	2222100	Um, but I, I had multi ball happen a couple of times.
2222100	2228740	Um, and I keep forgetting just how much the Dalek voice in that one, because the speakers
2228740	2231700	aren't the best, uh, makes my head hurt.
2231700	2233380	Of course I already had a headache.
2234020	2239060	Um, but yeah, and of course tonight I'm going to be playing dead by daylight later.
2239060	2245460	If anyone wants to play with me and Gwen, um, I've also been really hooked on my word
2245460	2248820	scapes, like unbelievably hooked on my word scapes.
2249540	2256340	Um, especially now that they seem to have had new, um, new puzzles released.
2256340	2258980	Cause I'm finally starting to see different words.
2259620	2267380	Um, I like that one of the words now is Eureka and that, uh, it still doesn't like for me
2267380	2269220	to, to play body parts.
2269940	2272820	Although it does recognize that orgy is a word.
2272820	2274740	It will not recognize butt sex.
2276180	2280420	Cause remember you can't spell subtext without butt sex.
2281940	2282580	It's true.
2282580	2283620	Useful life advice.
2283620	2284180	Thank you.
2284180	2284740	Useful.
2284740	2285780	I learned the hard way.
2285780	2287220	It's the, it's the same letters.
2288100	2295700	Um, but, um, I'm also trying to, I, I've, I'm about ready to finish final fantasy four.
2295700	2299700	So I'm trying to decide if I want to do five or move on to star ocean.
2300500	2302500	So I'm probably putting a pull up.
2302500	2306020	I'm personally leaning toward five just cause I haven't played the game in an age.
2307060	2307460	Yeah.
2307460	2309540	And I've never played star ocean.
2309540	2315780	So five is, um, a little weirder because you know, those of us in the U S well, it's just
2315780	2319140	that like those of us in the U S don't have those high school memories or whatever you
2319140	2323620	want to call it a five because we never got to play five until when, when did they finally
2323620	2324580	officially release it here?
2324580	2326180	Was it in the PS one classic Sarah?
2326180	2329540	When they finally let us play that game or was it even later than that?
2329540	2330260	Yes.
2330260	2333780	So I had played translated copies of it before.
2335220	2336020	Um, oh yeah.
2336020	2337140	I remember the translator ROM.
2337140	2340660	That's how I played it in college, but even the translator ROM had its issues, you know,
2340660	2342020	it was still, it was still weird.
2342020	2342580	Yeah.
2342580	2344100	But all right.
2344100	2344500	Oh yeah.
2344500	2344820	Yeah.
2344820	2345940	It's character's name was butts.
2346820	2347460	Yeah.
2347460	2355300	I always, my, I always translated it as like Batsu as in like, you know, the same spelling
2355300	2360580	as Batsu from, uh, uh, project justice or, uh, she did to justice.
2360580	2361620	Kuckling.
2361620	2368260	Um, so, but there's other people who do it like as Bart's or something.
2368260	2369380	I just say Batsu.
2369380	2370020	Yeah.
2370020	2375220	Um, but I, I don't remember a whole lot of it, even though I've beaten it.
2375220	2378660	So I'm looking forward to re-familiarizing myself with that.
2379300	2382500	Um, and again, I haven't played star ocean.
2382500	2384180	I also have Emerald dragon.
2385060	2390900	Um, but I'm trying to decide when I play that, if I'm going to do the turbo graphics version,
2390900	2393940	cause I do own the turbo graphics version.
2394900	2402180	Um, like a legit Japanese one, or if I'm going to play the, the super Famicom one.
2402180	2408420	Um, and, and, and, and also I picked up, uh, a game and I don't think he can hear me, but
2408420	2414900	I picked up, um, uh, Kunio, uh, dodge ball as in super dodge ball.
2416020	2417460	Oh, super Famicom.
2417460	2417960	Great.
2418600	2425480	So I'm, I'm hoping that, uh, spouse gets a kick out of it, even though we've got it on
2425480	2426120	the upper drive.
2427480	2428360	All right.
2428360	2429560	Oh, oh, one last thing.
2429560	2430060	Yeah.
2430600	2436920	On teepublic, I found Vib ribbon t-shirts and stickers, and I have a Vib ribbon sticker
2436920	2443160	now that when, uh, you're doing your gaming week, I will try to find my picture album
2443160	2443960	and show.
2443960	2446120	There is a dangerous sale on that site yesterday.
2446120	2449720	Cause, uh, it's always on, there's always dangerous sales on there.
2449720	2450280	I know, right?
2450280	2451240	That's why I got this shirt.
2451880	2454360	I absolutely want a Vib ribbon shirt.
2454360	2455320	It's so cute.
2455320	2456360	And I love Vibri.
2456360	2461000	In fact, to the point that I've actually been trying, I've been considering finding a copy
2461000	2463240	of Moji ribbon, even though it's very text heavy.
2464040	2465960	What is your, what is your shirt?
2465960	2466280	Loki?
2466280	2467880	Cause the microphone kind of blocks it for us.
2467880	2469000	So I can't really see what's on it.
2469000	2469560	It's a met.
2471720	2472760	Oh, if you can see it.
2472760	2474200	Oh, okay.
2474200	2474600	Yeah.
2474600	2476760	It's it's hard to see, but yeah.
2476760	2477000	Okay.
2477880	2479640	Oh, and one more thing.
2479640	2479880	Yeah.
2479880	2480760	I might've said it.
2480760	2482520	I ordered a reverse bear trap today.
2483080	2483240	Yeah.
2483240	2484120	You mentioned that in the beginning.
2484120	2484600	That's all right.
2484600	2484920	Yeah.
2484920	2485560	All right.
2485560	2488120	Let's uh, go to Loki and talk about your gaming week.
2488120	2488760	How was your game?
2488760	2493560	So, uh, I played mostly Minecraft this week as usual.
2493560	2494760	I know it's shocking.
2494760	2499560	It's I've been working on that massive project still, which I just about done with.
2499560	2507000	I have the main, the main, uh, body done and I'm finishing up with the last bits of the arms and
2507000	2507800	stuff.
2507800	2509960	So that'll be coming this week in a video.
2510680	2515480	I wanted to have it out this weekend, but it's just, it was too massive to be able to finish
2515480	2515960	this week.
2515960	2519160	And I tried lots of hours, like 80 some hours in there.
2519800	2528600	Um, uh, I also played, uh, was it, uh, trombone, uh, champion.
2529320	2530360	I think that's what it's called now.
2530360	2530760	Trombone.
2531640	2531880	Yeah.
2531880	2532600	Trombone champ.
2533480	2534680	Very fun game.
2534680	2535640	Very strange game.
2537400	2539080	Hard for me to play that.
2539080	2542920	I don't know, like with the mouse stuff, like, I feel like it's hard to like, kind of move
2542920	2543240	fast.
2543240	2547560	If I think I need to adjust some of the settings in there, I've definitely took off the, um,
2547560	2548520	inverter controls.
2548520	2549240	Cause that was annoying.
2549800	2552040	But, um, yeah, it's a funny game.
2552040	2557240	I like the, the mix between like, it's like, we music almost like the presentation of it
2557240	2563960	with like baboons and like, what else?
2563960	2571640	Like they also have like, uh, like, um, all sorts of like weird, uh, sirens and stuff
2571640	2572600	going off in it.
2572600	2578120	And, um, it's just a really weird mashup of things, but it's funny.
2578120	2579080	It's worth checking out.
2579720	2580120	All right.
2580120	2584600	Um, so yeah, I wanted to get to monkey Island this week, but I didn't get to that, but hopefully
2584600	2585000	you soon.
2585640	2586140	All right.
2586920	2588280	Uh, my gaming week.
2588280	2592360	So you might notice if you're watching live on Twitch, I have these giant headphones cause
2592360	2593240	they're new.
2593240	2596840	I bought new headphones this week cause my other ones finally died, which was sad and
2596840	2600600	it was getting very annoying, but it's been nice to actually be able to hear games again.
2600600	2605960	The, um, the audio is really, it's a, it's a razor crack and, uh, I think this is the
2605960	2607640	V3, so it was on sale.
2607640	2611080	So, um, yeah, it does the, it does the chroma lights in it, although they're very hard to
2611080	2612360	see on the stream right now.
2612360	2616600	Um, but yeah, so like when I play Diablo three, they turn red and all that silly stuff.
2616600	2618440	So yeah, it's fun.
2618440	2620200	It's, it's, it's silly, but it's fun.
2620200	2625880	But, um, as far as games that I've been enjoying using it, uh, a lot of the same old stuff,
2625880	2628200	you know, I've also been playing dead by daylight.
2628200	2631400	I'm getting really close to finishing this tome, which I never do.
2631400	2632360	I never do.
2632360	2635560	So that is, uh, that is quite an accomplishment in itself.
2635560	2639560	Uh, mostly really good cosmetics, by the way, in the rift.
2639560	2640440	Did you get them?
2640440	2643560	Uh, no, I'm, uh, when I say finish, I mean, get through the fourth page.
2643560	2645320	I never even get that far.
2645320	2646920	So, but I'm only like two challenges away.
2646920	2649320	So I'm going to stream tomorrow to try to finish.
2649320	2650360	Cause I'm really close.
2650360	2653400	I got, I made really good progress on the gen generator.
2653400	2653720	Okay.
2653720	2655240	I should, I should be around after work.
2655240	2659560	I just not sure the specifics for the holiday and that should be after services.
2659560	2659880	Nice.
2659880	2660120	Okay.
2660120	2661720	Yeah, it should be about four 30.
2661720	2666440	Um, so, um, I'll, I'll be playing a little bit of that, trying to finish that.
2666440	2669560	And, um, I did a little killer as well.
2669560	2674040	So, um, uh, I played that all on stream, my own stream on Friday.
2674680	2677160	Um, I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14.
2677160	2682280	Uh, I finished the Island, which I think I may have done last week, uh, got my Island
2682280	2683160	to rank 10.
2683160	2689320	But this week I actually built every building the farthest it could go.
2689320	2694520	Um, so I've built all my granaries to level three, all the workshops to level three.
2694520	2697320	So like literally everything is maxed out.
2697320	2703720	And then I found out there is another special artifact that you can make, but it is, it's
2703720	2705720	a really hard crafting project.
2705720	2712200	So I can either buy the mats for 3 million Gil, which I'm thinking about doing, or I
2712200	2714600	can just invest in my crafters and try to make this.
2714600	2717080	So it's, it's called a water otter fountain.
2717080	2719080	So I'm trying to make that for my Island.
2719080	2723480	I'm telling you, some people raid, some people glamour.
2723480	2728040	I am all in on that stupid Island life thing.
2728040	2728920	It's great.
2728920	2731240	And I'm so excited for them to make enhancements to it later.
2731240	2732920	Sounds like animal crossing.
2732920	2738040	I would say it's, it's definitely influenced by that, but it's, um, more the, um, you
2738120	2743320	know, the farming SIM games, uh, that are a plenty in Japanese culture that we see over.
2743320	2743640	Yeah.
2743640	2744920	All of it, all of it.
2744920	2750200	So it's, you know, it's, it's not as in depth, but it's definitely inspired by that stuff.
2750200	2757000	So, uh, let's see, uh, pod culture says you didn't go for the kitty ear version talking
2757000	2760440	about my headphones to which tape plays games calls me a fake streamer.
2760440	2769240	Uh, no, I did the, these generic, uh, you know, bland, uh, heterosexual black ones were
2769240	2770040	on sale.
2770040	2774760	So I just bought the, cause price always is going to win over functions.
2774760	2777240	So there is that.
2778120	2780040	Um, let's see.
2780040	2782440	So, uh, what else have I played during my gaming week?
2782440	2785640	Um, I played Assassin's Creed Odyssey a little more than on Wednesday.
2785640	2788280	I'm still liking that game more than I thought I would.
2788360	2793720	Um, don't love the boat fights though, because once you get like a full big boat, then you
2793720	2797800	get into these things where you get into like Archer fights with other boats and these big
2797800	2799560	boat, I didn't like that part.
2799560	2801080	It was really clunky to me.
2801080	2803640	I don't like trying to drive the boat around and all that stuff.
2803640	2809080	And that part's not fun, but that's otherwise just a blemish on what I'm, I'm still enjoying
2809080	2810040	as a game.
2810040	2811640	Um, that was a pretty fun.
2812200	2812600	Okay.
2812600	2815160	So Rob, you've talked about most of those games and playing before.
2815160	2817320	Did you play anything new this week?
2817320	2818120	Yes, I did.
2818120	2819800	I did play one new game this week.
2819800	2824360	And so we actually have a story coming up later in the show about this series of games.
2824360	2827160	And I decided to jump in and buy one of them.
2827160	2830360	So it's the Atari recharged games.
2830360	2834920	So that is exactly the reaction I had.
2834920	2837960	Is that the collection or is that like just the remade game?
2837960	2838600	Okay.
2838600	2840200	They are working on a collection.
2840200	2842120	There's that there's like a 50 collection.
2842120	2847080	There's the mini game thing, the WarioWare thing, but with Atari that is coming out in
2847080	2847800	October.
2847800	2853480	But I didn't even realize these recharge things, which they've done for Centipede, Breakout,
2853480	2855640	Gravatar, Asteroids.
2855640	2857560	Like there's quite a few of them, right?
2857560	2864120	They've they're out and they've been now I think they were out on Atari VCS first, but
2864120	2866840	of course, how many people actually bought into that?
2866840	2869640	And I think Atari start to realize that too.
2869640	2871640	So they've been doing these releases on Steam.
2871640	2878360	So the one that I picked up was Yars Revenge Recharge because I love that 2600 game.
2878360	2881640	I don't know how many of you remember that from back in the day, but here's a little
2881640	2884280	peek at what it looks like for those that are watching on Twitch.
2884280	2889640	So you can see it has a lot of the similar mechanic from the first game where you try
2889640	2893480	to go in, you're trying to either shoot the shields or you can eat the shields.
2893480	2898760	And then you're charging that giant photon laser that you then try to blast the main
2898760	2899320	cannon with.
2899320	2903080	If you've ever played the original Yars Revenge, that will make a little more sense
2903080	2904360	than if you've never played the game.
2904360	2909240	Then it just sounds like I'm kind of just speaking of another language, which, you know,
2909240	2909960	I get it.
2909960	2915560	But of course, the thing about this game is because it's recharged, it's very pretty,
2915560	2919160	bright, has that kind of geometry wars.
2919160	2923160	And literally it's a twin stick shooter now because, you know, the Atari 2600 only had
2923160	2924760	what the joystick and the one button now.
2924760	2927320	But of course, they changed it into a twin stick shooter.
2927320	2930840	But of course, the levels become a lot more elaborate.
2930840	2935160	So for example, on Twitch, we're watching a stage where you have the main cannon in
2935160	2940600	the center, but then you have six sub cannons around the main cannon and the main cannon
2940600	2944600	powers one of the sub cannons at a time to do a different type of move.
2944600	2948920	So it adds a little bit of chaos into the generic formula or into the regular formula
2948920	2952520	from the old game, which, you know, might have felt a little generic because it was
2952520	2953720	on the Atari 2600.
2954120	2958440	Um, is this game like a revolutionary twin stick shooter?
2958440	2959160	Nah.
2959160	2961960	But does it do the nostalgia factor pretty well?
2961960	2962520	Yeah.
2962520	2964440	Like I was pleasantly surprised.
2964440	2968200	I kind of like this a lot more than I thought I would.
2968200	2970280	So there's that.
2970280	2973800	So that was another game I played this week was Yars revenge recharge.
2973800	2977400	And now I'm a little curious to check out maybe some of those other Atari recharge games
2977400	2977800	as well.
2978680	2980840	I'm not sure they're all fantastic.
2980840	2986120	And I think you have to remember they are more inspired versions when, you know, keep
2986120	2991160	in mind Atari 2600 games fit into 4,000 kilobyte cartridges.
2991160	2994200	Most of them, that's 4,000 characters.
2994200	2994840	Okay.
2994840	2997000	That's a lot to squeeze into a cartridge.
2997000	3001000	And so the game loops in these game games were very simple.
3001000	3005960	And so these recharge games are just kind of enhancing that game loop with some graphics
3005960	3009720	and some other little, but they're not going to totally reinvent the game because remember
3009720	3013160	there was like a Yars revenge sequel they did on like Xbox 360.
3013160	3017480	And it wasn't, it wasn't that good because it just completely deviated.
3017480	3021000	It's like they just took a new type of shooter game and put the Yars revenge name on it.
3021000	3022520	So yeah.
3022520	3023960	Tiger call is actually talking about it.
3023960	3027640	I remember when they tried to reboot this game as a rail shooter, it was a name only
3027640	3030440	good thing they made what looks like a true remake of the original.
3030440	3034760	I'm not sure I would call it a remake of the original, but yes, I otherwise get where you're
3034840	3040520	going with that comment is that it, it, it retains the spirit of the original much better
3040520	3044840	than a rail shooter, which, you know, was just any old other rail shooter did.
3044840	3045080	So.
3047000	3050280	Dark Tetsuya in chat says I played asteroid and centipede recharge.
3050280	3053720	They're fun, but I think my one complaint was that it's a one life and you're done
3053720	3054840	game instead of three.
3055560	3059320	But again, that kind of goes back to some of the old game loops.
3059320	3062680	Although I think, you know, even asteroids in the arcade and centipede, you did have
3062680	3063480	three lives.
3063480	3069160	So I think in this one and yours, you have three health States.
3069160	3072440	So that might be the type of thing they're doing instead is that instead of three lives,
3072440	3073800	you get three health States.
3073800	3077000	So I, but I haven't played those other ones yet, but I'll probably pick them up.
3077000	3080680	I enjoyed yards, revenge recharged enough to go.
3080680	3080920	Okay.
3080920	3082280	Cause it was only 10 bucks.
3082280	3085320	And I think missile command recharge is like three bucks right now.
3085320	3089880	So, you know, they're not trying to charge 60, 70 bucks for them, which is good.
3089880	3091240	Cause that, that would be laughable.
3091240	3092120	It would never get that.
3092120	3093240	They'd never get that.
3093240	3096280	So 10 bucks, that's a lot more reasonable.
3096280	3097320	So yeah.
3098360	3098680	All right.
3099560	3101320	We're going to get into some more gaming news.
3101960	3103560	First though, I just want to remind everybody.
3103560	3106680	We will be here live next week on October 2nd.
3106680	3110680	We will not be live on October 9th as mentioned plenty during the show.
3110680	3114520	Otherwise dark soccer and I both are going to be in San Diego at Twitch con.
3114520	3116680	We will not be back in time for the show.
3116680	3118040	I don't fly back till Monday.
3118040	3120840	And you heard dark soccer earlier say she's doing Disneyland on Monday.
3120840	3122680	So we won't be back in time for the show.
3122760	3125160	So it'll be Bobby will be here that night though.
3125160	3128920	So you can certainly tune in to VOG network and check out Bobby black Wolf.
3128920	3130360	Maybe he'll run long.
3130360	3132680	Maybe he can call you next week or in two weeks.
3132680	3133560	Loki.
3133560	3134040	I don't know.
3134040	3134680	Or Loki.
3134680	3138680	I don't know if you're planning on doing a stream or anything, but just take a night
3138680	3138920	off.
3138920	3139560	You earned it.
3139560	3140680	It's hard to say.
3140680	3142040	Hard to say you didn't earn it.
3142040	3143720	So there's no time to take time.
3143720	3145160	I have to keep making stuff.
3145160	3146760	So you have to keep mining and crafting.
3147720	3148040	All right.
3148040	3157560	Let's tell you how many, how many, how many materials are 300,000 blocks, 185 shulker
3157560	3158920	boxes worth of materials.
3161400	3164200	I was gonna say, I thought your last build was something like 200,000 blocks.
3164200	3166200	You said this one is 300,000.
3166200	3166760	Yeah.
3166760	3167260	Yeah.
3168040	3168520	All right.
3169160	3171560	Well, we'll, we'll keep an eye out for the YouTube.
3171560	3173960	All right, let's move on.
3173960	3178920	Let's get into tonight's first story, which has to official first story, which has to
3178920	3182920	do with some other ongoing Twitch issues of which there were several this week.
3182920	3184440	So there was a lot.
3184440	3186360	Start us off with the first couple Loki.
3187240	3189480	Twitch has had a week.
3190120	3199960	So starting things off, there was a live stream by a streamer known as a slicker who basically
3199960	3207400	admitted to after being called out about it to stealing, or I should say, scamming people
3207400	3213720	out of $200,000 to fund his gambling addiction.
3215320	3221000	So he was, I guess he was betting on CSGO stuff.
3222840	3224840	I'm not really sure if that was the case.
3224840	3229000	I thought it was sports betting is what I thought it was, but may have been CSGO.
3229000	3229640	Who knows?
3229640	3230280	It doesn't matter.
3230280	3236360	So he, he came out and basically he was going and asking people like making up stories like,
3236360	3238360	Oh yeah, my funds are frozen.
3238360	3240280	He would go ask his streamer friends.
3240280	3244600	He would ask his viewers, just ridiculous stuff.
3244600	3246200	And then finally admitted to it.
3246920	3251320	Tape, thankfully, just tape play games in our chat is clarifying.
3251320	3254200	CSGO is what first ignited it, but it was sports betting.
3254760	3256280	Yeah, I thought it was sports betting.
3256280	3258120	And I think it was more than 200,002.
3258120	3263400	I think it ended up being like 350,000, but it was a lot of money they scammed out of
3263400	3264120	different people.
3264120	3267480	So there was that, that kind of kicked everything off.
3267480	3272680	So then when people started hearing about it, of course, reacting to it and stuff, there
3272680	3282760	was this movement by Pokimane, Mizkif, and I think others as well that had been Devin
3282760	3288520	Nash, I guess, who had been threatening to boycott Twitch for a week during Christmas
3288520	3297240	to perform or to protest their kind of supporting these gambling streams, lax policies on them.
3298360	3301400	So they made this like they were talking about and stuff like that.
3301400	3307400	So then fast forward to shortly thereafter where Twitch comes out.
3307400	3309400	Just jump in before you get to the Twitch thing.
3309960	3313000	I have to say it because I know there's plenty of you that are thinking it and there's a
3313000	3314200	lot of people that are saying this.
3314200	3316840	In fact, there's Bobby Black Wolf into chat saying this, too.
3317400	3318120	It's amazing.
3318120	3321640	And Bobby says it's amazing how these top tier streamers know they can throw their weight
3321640	3324280	around like this, but they were silent during the hate raids.
3324280	3326040	Actually, not all of them were silent.
3326040	3330360	I believe some of them were on record because when you do YouTube, you do these streamings,
3330360	3331400	you have these clips out there.
3331400	3336200	Some of them were on record saying, and I quote, what was the hashtag they were using
3336200	3337960	for the Twitch day off for that?
3337960	3340120	A day without Twitch, I think was what they were calling it.
3340120	3341320	I'm sorry if I'm messing the name up.
3341320	3343640	It was a few months ago, and I don't recall.
3343640	3348600	But with some of these streamers, the same people, some of them were on the record saying
3348600	3350840	a day off Twitch will never work.
3352280	3357480	And yet with this now they're going and they're saying this is what we need to do.
3357480	3361480	So it definitely looks not good now.
3361480	3365080	You know, I think Pokimane are one of them, and I'm sorry if I'm misattributing.
3365080	3367480	I don't have look, I'm a grown ass man.
3367560	3371240	I don't have enough time to follow a lot of this Twitch drama and who said what and he
3371240	3373000	said she said and all this crap.
3373000	3375640	So I can really only look at the bottom line sometimes.
3375640	3380920	But one of them went on record and said like, well, I've learned a lot since then.
3380920	3383400	And you know, I was trying to be quiet.
3383400	3388040	I was trying to do things behind the scenes last time and make change happen.
3388040	3390680	But I've learned since then that you have to get loud.
3390680	3397320	OK, so I will smile, acknowledge politely one clap.
3397320	3403160	Your evolution that you've come full circle and you realized, but you have to understand
3403160	3410760	it is incredibly frustrating for many people when you were supposed to have their backs
3410760	3417240	during this hate raid crisis that you as a big streamer came off as not caring because
3417240	3418920	it's not something that affects you.
3418920	3423240	Or can't you just put your stream into follow only mode or any of this stuff?
3423240	3430280	Because unfortunately, a lot of these big streamers have not had to deal with being
3430280	3436520	called a slur, whether racial, sexual, other type of minorities.
3436520	3440360	I mean, look at the most popular streamers.
3440360	3445000	Most of them have never had to deal with being called a slur before.
3445000	3449960	So they clearly don't understand the psychological toll that it takes on a lot of people and
3450040	3453960	that it's much more than just clicking a button to make it all stop and go away.
3453960	3460760	So I that part has to be said because there's there's a lot of voices out there, especially
3460760	3465480	folks, you know, people of color and other minorities out there that are saying like,
3465480	3467400	where were y'all when it was the hate raids?
3467960	3473480	And it does need to be said like, again, I can applaud evolution.
3473480	3479640	And OK, we do need if you got to educate people and if people are showing they're educated,
3479640	3480200	then OK.
3481400	3487400	But it also seems like and I got to be honest, I'm not trying to poopoo gambling addiction.
3487400	3488600	It's a serious issue.
3488600	3490600	It's a serious thing and so forth.
3490600	3497000	But it's it's also kind of like one guy's issue that really blew up.
3497000	3503160	And I understand that there's also much more gambling stuff that's on Twitch, especially
3503160	3506520	when we get into the CD crypto sites and that type of stuff.
3506520	3512200	And I completely understand that Twitch at the end of the day is ultimately responsible
3512200	3513800	for what's on its shelf.
3513800	3514120	Right.
3514120	3518200	A store, if they don't want to carry something on the shelf, they don't have to carry that
3518200	3519720	particular item on the shelf.
3519720	3525160	Yeah, I'm just surprised that this is what they decided to address.
3525160	3531480	That's that's the weird thing that it took this for you to decide crypto gambling was
3531480	3535000	something that maybe should be addressed or I don't know.
3535000	3540040	They're trying to I get the sense they're kind of trying to say now that, well, we were
3540040	3544440	going to do this the whole time and now we're going to unveil our policy today because of
3544440	3546440	all this chatter that's been going on.
3546440	3549320	It just the timing is a little.
3550600	3550840	Yeah.
3550840	3552440	Tay says, I'm surprised you're surprised.
3552440	3552680	Yeah.
3552680	3553080	Yeah, sure.
3553080	3554200	Nothing should be shocking anymore.
3554200	3555080	Yeah, I get it.
3555080	3557640	It's just it's just the timing.
3558920	3560440	Sus, right?
3560440	3561080	That whole thing.
3561640	3567240	So because they're they're supposed to be making the ads so that they made it.
3567240	3574280	Twitch came out later on, said, Yeah, we're basically going to crack down on some things.
3574280	3578920	So they're going to be making a policy update on the 18th, which is really random.
3578920	3583560	That's on Tuesday to prohibit streaming of gambling sites that include slots, roulette
3583560	3587960	dice games that aren't licensed in the US or other jurisdictions that provide sufficient
3587960	3589400	consumer protection.
3589480	3596440	These sites will include stake.com, rollbit.com, dual bits and roulette.com.
3597000	3599400	However, they may identify others as they move forward.
3599960	3604440	Sports betting, fantasy sports and poker are still going to be continuing to be allowed
3604440	3605080	on the site.
3605880	3610280	I do want to make I just want to make sure I'm very clear on something, too, because
3610280	3611480	I'll get corrected on it.
3612760	3615560	Regardless, I a couple things here.
3615560	3622360	So a lot of this has to do with these crypto gambling sites and things that are a lot more
3622360	3623160	shady.
3623160	3629800	And what's really shady about it was that they were paying big name streamers, basically
3629800	3637160	giving them free money on the house money, lots of big money to make big bets on these
3637160	3641800	sites that for all I know now, I don't I don't know how to always find the scenes, but for
3641800	3646040	all I know, could have been rigged to ensure that because, you know, you can tell a slot
3646040	3647640	machine what the payout should be.
3647640	3652040	So it could it could easily be rigged for a certain user to make sure that they are
3652040	3658360	actually going to win on that money to entice other people to come into that site and spend
3658360	3659080	a lot of money.
3659720	3663880	That is the part that the CSGO gambling stuff.
3663880	3664760	Yeah, exactly.
3664760	3670200	That's the fucking shady part that no one anywhere, including Twitch should.
3670200	3676200	And I'm surprised that these well, again, I'm not surprised, but you know that these
3676200	3680280	big name streamers on Twitch are willing to tie their entire identity to it.
3680280	3684920	And none of them are going down with the ship, which is fascinating to me.
3684920	3687640	But y'all make your choices about who you want to watch.
3687640	3688200	Cool, cool.
3689880	3691720	There's a lot of other streams out there.
3691720	3697080	Like I know like on YouTube, I have a friend, a really good friend of mine who loves gambling
3697080	3702680	YouTube's and like so what she watches, she watches people go to Vegas and they film like
3702680	3703160	with it.
3703160	3705720	I didn't even know Vegas will let you do this, but apparently they will because it's all
3705720	3706600	promo for them.
3706600	3711080	They will film themselves playing slot machines and put it on.
3711080	3717400	But they're walking into an establishment, playing the actual game and filming it and
3717400	3721480	then, you know, putting it out for better and for worse, because usually it goes the
3721480	3722920	other way onto YouTube.
3722920	3726120	And I like there's big conventions for this stuff and all of it.
3726200	3727880	But there's a huge key difference.
3727880	3729080	It's not crypto.
3729080	3734440	It's licensed in the US and it's the person that goes in and sits down at the machine
3734440	3740280	is getting the exact same thing that anyone who comes in and walks in place that machine
3740280	3740680	would get.
3741240	3748760	So yeah, I've had someone made comments about how I don't know if they had gambling issues
3748760	3753480	or someone they knew had gambling issues that like watching these streams because like not
3753480	3759160	the obviously the crypto ones, but like the slots streams where they're not always winning.
3759160	3764680	So it's not like, you know, it's kind of more reinforcing the fact that, yeah, you know,
3764680	3770040	I may have these, you know, compulsions to play slots, but there's a good chance I won't
3770040	3774920	win this stuff, like kind of bringing you back to reality, I guess, instead of, you
3774920	3778360	know, a big dopamine hit that, oh, my God, you're going to make so much money off this
3778360	3778760	stuff.
3778760	3782200	Yeah, that's kind of a unique tech.
3782200	3784440	I haven't heard that before.
3784440	3788760	But yeah, I know some of the people behind all this stuff like Pokemon and stuff like
3788760	3789000	that.
3789000	3791720	I mean, let me get into it.
3791720	3793080	There are strangers of controversy.
3793080	3793800	Let's put it that way.
3793800	3798440	There's a lot of comments in chat here over twitch.tv slash vog network.
3798440	3801160	I want to get to some of these tape plays games.
3801160	3804280	A lot of good insight here saying hate raids against 10 viewer count.
3804280	3806040	People are irrelevant to Twitch.
3806040	3811400	The site is so insanely top heavy that unless it's an issue impacting the top 5% of streamers,
3811400	3814120	Twitch is going to give us platitudes and empty promises.
3816760	3817560	Correct statement.
3818200	3818840	It sucks.
3818840	3822600	But that is the way it's been for a lot of things.
3822600	3825240	YouTube is honestly no different in that regard.
3825240	3830440	And a lot of these sites, you know, they're going to cater to the people that are having
3830440	3832040	the most views and all of this stuff.
3832040	3835880	And, you know, to hell with the 10 viewers and so forth, which sucks.
3835880	3842040	It was only when all of those 10 viewer channels banded together and put their foot down and
3842040	3843560	said, this shit needs to change.
3843560	3847000	Now, Twitch, the Twitch finally came out and I'm talking about the hate raids, of course,
3847000	3851160	finally came out and did something and, you know, showed the new tools and the changes
3851160	3857880	they were doing with all of this that I hope we continue to hear more about how people
3857880	3862840	can protect themselves from harassment on this platform at TwitchCon, because we know
3862840	3866920	they're saving something under the curtain to unveil at the TwitchCon keynote.
3866920	3870840	There's going to be some silly new feature that's going to make Twitch money because
3870840	3873880	Twitch really needs to make money right now based on some of these other things Loki's
3873880	3874360	going to get to.
3875640	3879400	But what I think I'd love to hear more about and I'm sure DarkSakura would love to hear
3879400	3882760	more about and lots of people out there would love to hear more about is, again, how can
3882760	3888120	I what are the tools to better protect myself from harassment on this platform in order
3888120	3890360	for me to invest myself more in it?
3890360	3892760	So that would be what I'd love to hear in a keynote.
3892920	3894920	Anyway, let me get some more comments from chat.
3895480	3899400	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, but what if you have a podcast or talk show on Twitch where
3899400	3904600	you're talking about gambling and crypto, giving people advice about gambling and crypto?
3904600	3905960	Aren't those just as bad?
3908040	3910680	Kind of, it's all in how it's framed.
3910680	3913560	I would say kind of, yes, because you're glamorizing it.
3914280	3921880	But are you taking the responsibility to say, while you're saying that, to also say, here
3921880	3926600	are some issues, here are some things you can look for to see if you might be addicted
3926600	3927480	to gambling.
3927480	3931400	And I'm not talking about just throwing out a 1-800 ever and saying, if you or somebody
3931400	3933320	have a loved one have a gambling problem, call 1-800.
3935160	3942120	No, no, that is that is that there is no meat on that bone that you're throwing that crowd.
3943320	3945080	Okay, there's not even meat on that bone.
3945960	3948760	At least taking some steps on how to identify.
3948760	3957720	And again, I would say the really big issue is the site paying the streamer to gamble
3957720	3961000	and win so that other people are encouraged to do that.
3962360	3963960	That was the big problem there.
3963960	3964760	Buying reviews.
3966200	3967560	Well, yeah, it's buying reviews.
3967560	3968360	It really is.
3968360	3973160	And I want to get to this where Tay plays games, says in chat, morality for those people
3973160	3977160	tends to go out the window when they're quite literally making millions of dollars from
3977160	3979080	streaming deals with crypto gambling.
3979080	3982920	Not saying it's right or that I agree with it, but it's very understandable why people
3982920	3984040	would sell their souls.
3984600	3991400	And that's a very I'm trying to get the right word here, but it's a good point.
3991400	3995480	And it's just one of those things where it's one of those some pills are hard to swallow
3995480	3997400	and that is that is a hard one to swallow.
3997400	4003080	But absolutely true is that everybody has a price and some are just showing theirs pretty
4003080	4003880	openly with this.
4004120	4005320	So that's legit.
4007720	4008680	Tay also.
4009240	4010200	Oh, sorry, go ahead.
4010200	4014040	I'm just saying how much is your are your ethics worth?
4014040	4014540	Yeah.
4015640	4017720	Tay in chat also says, agreed, Rob.
4017720	4021480	Solidarity means banding together to protect ourselves because we sure as fuck won't get
4021480	4024520	it from Twitch, nor will we get support from the largest streamers.
4024520	4025960	They won't rock the boat.
4025960	4031400	So I'm glad, though, at least the small streamers are holding the large streamers accountable
4032040	4033000	with a lot of this.
4033000	4033960	With a lot of this.
4033960	4037160	So and we should always continue to do so.
4037160	4042680	So let's see, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, there are those coin machine games drop a
4042680	4047880	coin and it pushed the other coins down on YouTube that are strangely pleasing to watch.
4047880	4055480	But again, I feel like, again, doing YouTube's of those where you're walking into a Dave
4055480	4060360	and Busters or whatever it is and it ethically you're all you're doing is you're just filming
4060360	4061400	what you're doing anyway.
4061400	4063880	You're not getting paid by the site to do it.
4063880	4067960	The odds are no better or worse than any other person that would walk in there.
4067960	4071640	So your odds are you're going to see defeat more than you see winning.
4071640	4075480	I think there's a lot of stuff there where it's like, you know, I understand it.
4075480	4080760	And actually, you know, again, a lot of people might scratch the itch, so to speak, by watching
4080760	4084280	that stuff on YouTube as opposed to going down and spending a bunch of money themselves.
4084280	4087960	So I see some things out of it that might be good as well.
4087960	4090200	I see them as very, very different things.
4091160	4096200	DGRMS and chat says on a side note, I know someone who lost his fiance over gambling.
4096200	4103320	He kept spending his money on gotcha games, and that's a very good reminder, especially
4103320	4106920	as we're talking about this Madden stuff at the top of the show and all this other stuff.
4106920	4110840	Very good reminder that gambling is not just 777.
4111560	4116520	There is much other different forms of gambling than just 777.
4116520	4121480	And of course, you know, I'm speaking about a slot machine when, you know, that whole
4121480	4129560	thing you're talking about Final Fantasy 7, where you get the all sevens and then I sure
4129560	4130120	am not.
4130120	4131000	Hi, Siri.
4131000	4131960	Yeah, sorry.
4133160	4138680	Sometimes I go on rants and Siri thinks I'm talking to her fill of nine, fill of nine
4138680	4142040	and chat says money and profit are always prioritized.
4142040	4145960	And especially when we hear and I got to let Loki get to these other parts of things going
4145960	4149800	on with which when we hear about some of these, oh, yes, profit is very much prioritized
4149800	4150200	right now.
4150760	4152920	I want to get to some of these other comments in chat.
4152920	4157720	Godets says I can't tell if it's because of the drama recently or because gambling agencies
4157720	4162680	are looking to broadcast elsewhere, but I've been seeing ads for gambling websites recently
4162680	4168120	when I never used to see them because people are starting to find loopholes with gambling
4168120	4170520	laws is a huge part of it.
4170520	4174840	And I think while it's still open season on this stuff until they lock some of it down,
4174840	4179400	I believe we have propositions on the ballot here in California about very much this sort
4179400	4179880	of thing.
4179880	4182440	My gosh, yeah, we had.
4182440	4186920	Yeah, they're doing some crazy claims about different things on.
4186920	4190760	I've seen commercials because I'm watching Peacock now and they have commercials.
4190760	4192120	It's everywhere.
4193080	4194440	So let's see.
4194440	4200120	And TigerClaw in chat says gambling can really affect one's mental health.
4200120	4201320	Absolutely.
4201320	4206840	I mean, when we talk about gambling addiction, that is a mental health problem at the end
4206840	4208040	of the day, right?
4208040	4212360	And some people have to admit that they may have a problem.
4212360	4217000	And again, it is much more than saying, you know, if you or a loved one have a gambling
4217000	4221560	problem, call 1-800-STOP-GAMBLING or whatever the number is like in such a half-assed thing
4221560	4222680	to try to cover your ass.
4223560	4226760	I think you have to really talk about like if you're again to answer the question that
4226760	4230760	came up earlier about what if I have a podcast that talks about this type of stuff you need
4230760	4236200	to really focus and give long, hard insight as to what gambling might look like.
4237720	4241560	So it's not just slot machines and Kino, you know?
4242280	4245320	Well, and it's gotcha in this too.
4245320	4246120	Absolutely.
4246120	4248920	Card packs, booster packs, all of it.
4248920	4249640	Yeah, all of it.
4249640	4256760	I mean, anything that has some sort of random chance is technically a gamble.
4257480	4265560	Um, but it's all in the way it's done.
4265560	4270120	If it's, it's just, it's just really, really sticky.
4270120	4276600	I mean, and if one wants to really, you know, go into it every day, you make a decision
4276600	4284200	as a gamble, but those decisions aren't necessarily ones that are going to ruin your life and
4284200	4290920	the lives of others, or, or especially you remember, um, when we did Neopets back in
4290920	4297320	the day and Gaia online, those things were technically kid gambling, you know, they had
4297320	4299960	some of those different aspects in it, you know?
4299960	4305480	I mean, hell, uh, both of them had their own freaking stock markets practically.
4305480	4309320	Speaking of kid gambling, this is where the chat comments are going right now.
4309320	4313240	Tiger Claw in chat points out Pokemon Go is a gotcha as well.
4313240	4313960	Absolutely.
4314440	4315080	Absolutely.
4315800	4320280	Um, Tay plays games says you guys didn't talk about it, but one other point, Twitch
4320280	4322760	sorts by default from highest to lowest.
4322760	4327720	And this site is visited by a lot of kids who literally see the top 10 streams and two
4327720	4329960	or three of them are shady crypto slots.
4329960	4333400	That type of content is very front and center to developing minds.
4333400	4335240	Oh, that is an excellent point.
4335800	4337960	Although, and I'm not, I'm not trying to, what about your point?
4337960	4340040	I do want to make sure you're yes.
4340040	4345000	That point I did notice though within the past week and a half or so that Twitch stopped
4345000	4349160	showing me viewers high to low, even with my own following list.
4349160	4352840	And now it shows me who you most want to watch.
4352840	4355000	We think I hate that.
4355000	4355800	I hate it.
4355800	4356360	I hate it.
4356360	4356920	I hate it.
4356920	4361640	I only care about the people I'm following because I followed them for a reason.
4361640	4362140	Yeah.
4362680	4364920	So anyway, all right.
4365640	4370440	We have talked about, oh, Tay plays game says I'm part of an experiment.
4370440	4372200	It's not like that for everyone yet.
4372200	4378040	Well, I'm open to experimenting, you know, I wish I would have been asked first, but
4378040	4378520	that's all right.
4378520	4378760	Okay.
4378760	4383000	So I didn't know that wasn't open to everyone first, but again, I'm not trying to dismiss
4383000	4383720	the point.
4383720	4385640	I just try to, I have it right now.
4385640	4386120	Yeah.
4386120	4391240	I was thinking in my brain, I was like, is that why Twitch did that was to try to get
4391240	4392040	away from that.
4392120	4396440	But I sort of think at the end of the day, especially if you're new to Twitch and you
4396440	4400600	haven't established that pattern of what you like, then of course they're going to show
4400600	4406040	you the top streams and a lot of it's going to fall into this whole type of thing.
4406040	4412440	So I do have to say, though, that the streams that's been showing me lately are people
4412440	4413880	that I'm already following.
4413880	4415640	So maybe it is working.
4415640	4416040	I don't know.
4416840	4420040	Derek JH in chat says, but with my special system, I can't lose.
4420040	4421240	It's like free money.
4421240	4426600	Oh, well, you must be in the same program that XQC did I name names that those folks
4426600	4432280	are in that are playing those games online that basically the house is giving them money
4432280	4433480	and the house is letting them win.
4433480	4435240	You must be in that same program.
4435240	4435880	Congrats.
4436440	4440200	He's the good guy because he's giving back half of the money that that guy scammed the
4440200	4440920	other people out of.
4441720	4443000	So he's the good guy, right?
4445560	4447640	Anyway, there's been more Twitch drama this week.
4447640	4449720	I mean, that's enough Twitch drama to fill a week.
4449720	4451320	But let's let's talk about.
4451320	4453240	But wait, there's more.
4453240	4453720	There's more.
4456680	4463320	So then Twitch decided to come out and tell everybody about their brand new revenue split.
4463320	4464280	That's right.
4464280	4470680	So now what they're going to be doing as well is they're going to be updating the monetization
4470680	4472520	of some of their larger partners.
4473080	4481720	Um, I think it's really right now, some of the partners have a special 70 30 revenue
4481720	4482520	split right now.
4483320	4485480	But that's going to change to 50 50.
4485480	4492600	What they're saying is they're basically going to the ones that have that special, I guess,
4492600	4496600	deal right now it's going to be for the first 100,000 that they make are going to be 70 30.
4496600	4498280	Then afterwards, it's going to be 50 50.
4499080	4501240	And then everything else is going to be 50 50.
4501240	4506040	The reason why they're losing people, the reason why and this is the best part, this
4506040	4507720	is some mental gymnastics for you.
4507720	4513080	The reason why they say they need to drop that split and take more of that money, by
4513080	4518440	the way, also pushing more ads on the platform that also hurt people finding new streamers
4519320	4524120	is because Amazon Web Services is expensive.
4525000	4533960	And it's just too expensive for them to run a company that uses Amazon Web Services.
4534520	4537320	Because that that company Amazon just charges them too much.
4537880	4539000	Wait, hold on a second.
4539000	4540680	No, no, they're owned by Amazon.
4540680	4543240	So that doesn't make any goddamn sense.
4543240	4550200	So they're basically saying that, you know, Daddy company is charging me too much money
4550200	4551880	for this company to run.
4551880	4552380	What?
4552920	4554360	Like, that doesn't make any sense.
4554360	4557160	But that's the excuse is that it costs too much to run.
4558760	4563960	So their revenues, they tried to put out that stat that was like somebody who streams for
4563960	4571960	what was it for 100 concurrent viewers, 200 hours would cost them like 1500 bucks or so.
4571960	4577960	I don't know what the what the number was more than that it was it was for 100 concurrent
4577960	4585240	streamer or 100 concurrent viewers for 200 hours a month are more than a thousand costs
4585240	4587720	more than $1,000 per month for them.
4588520	4589560	Let's put it this way.
4590200	4597720	If you are a streamer, that's making that's that's putting out 200 hours worth of streams
4597720	4598360	in a month.
4598360	4601000	That's a lot of that's a lot of stream time.
4601000	4604360	And you're holding 100 concurrent concurrent viewers through them.
4604360	4610440	You are by far in the top percentage, probably decimal fractional percentage of Twitch and
4610440	4613000	crypto gambling sites probably want to partner with you.
4614040	4620920	Like that's a lot of money you would probably be making a ton of money from just streaming
4620920	4626280	in general, that they would be taking a portion of anyways, yes, telling me that you can't
4626280	4633480	pay $100 or $1,000 to run that, that that's too much for you, which I don't believe because
4633480	4636120	Amazon's a trillion dollar company.
4636120	4639480	And like, I just don't believe that.
4639480	4639960	I'm sorry.
4639960	4640680	It just doesn't.
4642120	4643480	Who are you trying to convince here?
4643480	4644760	Here's the thing.
4644760	4650440	And did your own mess and chat says if you're pulling 100 K a month, the 70 30 split ain't
4650440	4651640	going to break your bank.
4651640	4654760	It's actually it's 100 K on a rotating calendar year.
4654760	4658520	So but that's still you know, you're talking about people that I have 100 and that's just
4658520	4659880	what they're making off Twitch.
4659880	4664520	That doesn't count any type of other licensing deals, sponsorship deals, merchandise deals,
4665160	4670600	direct PayPal donations and things of that sort, convention appearances for some of them
4670600	4671960	and those sorts of things.
4671960	4673480	So it's 100 K on a rotating.
4673480	4676680	I mean, but that's still that's a decent chunk of change, right?
4676680	4677480	And here's the thing.
4678680	4682040	If you're pulling 100 K a month, the 70 30 split ain't going to break your bank.
4682040	4685800	And there is a part of me that certainly lands on that side of the fence where it's like,
4685800	4687800	well, it's hard to feel super innocent.
4687800	4688920	Isn't this interesting?
4688920	4693560	My how the tables have turned because now here's something where the partners could
4693560	4695720	really use the little people in this fight.
4699880	4708440	Anyway, but I think where this bothers people is there were a lot of people at that affiliate
4708440	4716280	level that wanted to grow into 70 30 and had those dreams of getting bigger and so forth
4716280	4721560	and so on that now they're not going to be able to do because, oh, Twitch is starting
4721560	4723160	to pull back a little bit.
4723160	4728920	And I think, again, another big problem here is optics, optics, messaging, messaging.
4728920	4731560	And very clearly, this statement that has come out.
4733720	4739720	Has this issues was not run by any sort of audience that was going to give an honest
4739720	4745560	feedback and honest assessment of what was going on with this statement and so forth.
4746440	4751160	Because a smarter way to have rolled out a message like this would have been we're going
4751160	4757160	to be changing the split here, but here's another way that you can earn money or here's
4757160	4759480	something else we're going to be putting in place.
4759480	4761800	Well, they're upping their ad revenue split.
4761800	4768520	So you get 55 percent of that now, which is beans from the vast majority of people.
4768520	4774760	And the only way you do that is to opt into three minutes of ads in an hour, which I think
4774760	4778040	you can time the ad yourself.
4778040	4781960	Most people are too lazy to do so, so they run the automatic ads.
4781960	4783880	I've gotten on this boat before.
4783880	4789480	I don't want to repeat myself too much, but I'm just going to say automatic ads on a small
4789480	4794920	channel, you are kneecapping yourself severely to growth.
4795800	4800280	Huge difference, huge, I want to make sure I'm clear, huge difference between automatic
4800280	4802840	ads and I need to go poop.
4802840	4804360	I'm going to run an ad while I'm pooping.
4805240	4809880	Because with an automatic ad, you're missing content and I can't tell you how annoyed.
4809880	4812040	Nothing gets me to turn a channel off faster.
4812040	4815400	And there are some big streamers that do this, even ones that play Dead by Daylight.
4815400	4817240	I'll be watching and they're right at the end of the match.
4817240	4820600	It's like, oddly enough, it's all killer streams I've seen do this.
4822120	4824840	Watching a match and are they about to get a forehook?
4824840	4830600	Oh, and then an ad jumps in, cuts off the rest of the match and comes back to the screen
4830600	4833080	where everybody's going and it's the wrap up of the match.
4833080	4837240	So I completely missed the climax of the match because the automatic ad, I turn those
4837240	4837880	streams off.
4837880	4844360	I unfollow them if I'm unfollowing the streamer, because that is garbage content that they're
4844360	4845240	putting out.
4845240	4846440	And that is the truth.
4847160	4849400	Experimented with the automatic ads.
4849400	4851800	Oh, you experimented with them?
4851800	4853080	I experimented with it.
4853080	4858120	I did it for like a month because I figured a month would be enough time to see how well
4858120	4858920	it worked.
4858920	4866440	I did the recommended thing to get the 55% revenue, whatever that Twitch was preaching.
4867160	4872440	And I found it to be more annoying than anything else.
4872440	4878600	So I'm doing another experiment right now where I'm doing a 30-second ad once an hour
4880120	4883160	to see if it's any better for people.
4883160	4885240	Because honestly enough, I'm going to forget.
4885880	4897320	Um, and so far, I think it's been a little bit less obtrusive, although I will sometimes
4897320	4900200	go ahead and just run one to run one instead.
4900840	4908360	But I really did not like that, that three minutes every hour bullshit.
4908360	4911400	I thought that it really annoyed people.
4911400	4916920	People would complain about the ads more to the point where I'm like, yes, I know, stop
4916920	4921880	telling me, you know, and now I'm there.
4921880	4927720	There's a benefit to having automatic ads if it's not something that you would likely
4927720	4928920	remember to do.
4928920	4934200	But I have mine set at the very bare minimum, and I'm going to see exactly how it works.
4936520	4941320	While I completely respect whatever choices you want to make with your content, I just
4942280	4948040	even with the short ads, really think about what content you might be sacrificing to do
4948040	4951000	that because we talked about earlier, how much is your content worth?
4951000	4952760	And I just testing it out.
4952760	4954600	Yeah, that's all I'm doing is testing it.
4954600	4957720	I would be curious if you look at the revenue you make off that I think you're really going
4957720	4960600	to assess the same worth it just about nothing.
4960600	4964600	I mean, to be perfectly honest, I've switched it back about two weeks ago.
4965560	4970840	And I don't see any point I would it's like you were saying earlier, I'd rather run the
4970840	4974840	ad when I go to the bathroom, you know, exactly all the time.
4974840	4978680	Well, it's a good idea to just get stretch and hydrate once an hour.
4978680	4981320	Anyway, it's a good reminder to you to do that, right?
4981320	4987080	Well, I mean, this is why I stream when I do because I, I start at four, five o'clock,
4987080	4988760	I go feed the cat, you know?
4988760	4989260	Yeah.
4989720	4992280	And but I wanted to see how it worked.
4992280	4999080	I figured giving myself a few weeks of of testing it to see how it is in the real world.
4999080	5005800	I would rather participate in it and form an opinion based on my, my experience, then
5006440	5011080	to, I guess, read and guess about it, I would rather see it in action.
5011080	5014760	And now that I've seen it in action, I can flat out say, yeah, shit.
5016280	5020760	And thank you for reminding me, I meant to change mine back this week.
5020760	5022920	Nothing wrong with an educated perspective.
5022920	5025640	I'm not gonna exactly I want on that.
5026200	5035640	I'm a firm believer that, I mean, I think that you can form a better opinion when you're
5035640	5042360	in the situation, you know, rather than just on looking at the straight details of it.
5042360	5045240	And I wanted to see how is this working?
5045240	5047000	I'm not a big streamer.
5047800	5050840	It's not gonna affect me that badly to test it out.
5051480	5055720	Um, but honestly, it was it was it was shit.
5056920	5057800	It was really shit.
5057800	5059080	It was annoying.
5059080	5065320	And I would watch because whenever I'm playing, I keep my dashboard open so that I can see
5066120	5072120	when the ads are coming up and when my pre the pre roll is disabled and all of that.
5072120	5078440	And it was just as easy for me to set it when I got the warning about about pre roll coming
5078440	5078920	up.
5079480	5079980	Yeah.
5080520	5084680	Now going to some of the comments from chat as she 100 Matt says, I think going from 70 30
5084680	5087320	to 50 50 is a big shift on short notice.
5087320	5088840	Folks have made this into a career.
5088840	5092040	If your employer is telling you they're going to be taking out for more of your paycheck,
5092040	5094040	don't be surprised if your employees leave.
5094040	5099160	And I think a big thing I'm hearing everywhere right now is diversify, diversify, diversify.
5099160	5103480	Do not put all of your eggs into twitches basket, which is exactly what which does not
5103480	5107960	need people doing right now if they really are in these, you know, dire financial straits.
5107960	5109240	And that goes back to the comments.
5109240	5110440	Somebody had talked about a billion.
5110440	5115000	Oh, as Joe and Hunter Matt said to play devil's advocate, Amazon spent a lot of money, 1 billion
5115000	5116120	to acquire Twitch.
5116120	5120280	If the service by itself is not returning on that investment as readily, why not reduce
5120280	5120920	the split?
5120920	5124600	If Twitch is Amazon's weakest revenue, just speculating, but don't know for sure.
5124600	5126600	Why not try to get more out of it?
5126600	5133720	It's just all of the money arguments are really hard to look at when you look at how much
5133720	5137080	Jeff Bezos puts in his pocket every minute.
5138120	5142360	Versus from nothing is pretty, pretty bullshit.
5142360	5149800	That's that's that's the very hard pill to swallow is that that's what makes all of this
5149800	5154920	like it look like look like bullshit and all is just because meanwhile, Jeff Bezos is still
5154920	5155880	pocketing how much?
5157160	5160200	And I'm supposed to feel sorry for the bitch, I don't.
5160440	5169000	The thing is, is that if they expected to make a lot of money on people playing video
5169000	5171800	games, they shouldn't have.
5172440	5176440	They should have just stuck with our cloud service and not deal with Twitch.
5176440	5179640	Twitch is kind of a niche.
5179640	5180520	I'm going to say it.
5180520	5186040	I mean, with as big as the as the events that they have and some of the streamers that they
5186040	5190120	have, it's still, you know, it's not something I would have expected to be.
5190120	5191960	A very big moneymaker.
5191960	5193240	I'm just going to be honest.
5193240	5193740	Yeah.
5195080	5198840	Quest Buster in chat says a streamer I sometimes watch has shifted more of their effort to
5198840	5203320	making YouTube content after one of their videos went viral for them and started generating
5203320	5204280	more revenue for them.
5204280	5206760	They get a few hundred viewers per stream.
5206760	5210280	Now they put a lot of work into making YouTube videos based on topics they want to cover
5210280	5213160	and get a solid return and haven't been shy about saying that.
5213160	5215720	Yeah, YouTube makes me a lot more money at this point than Twitch.
5216440	5217880	But here's one of the problems.
5218840	5223640	YouTube could also go ass up and do something that is not.
5223640	5227960	We've seen them do this before with copyright strikes, banning channels that shouldn't
5227960	5231480	be banned, silencing, shifting revenue streams.
5231480	5233960	YouTube is not some fucking holy land.
5233960	5236760	Let's get that 100% clear.
5236760	5239560	YouTube has problems all of its own.
5239560	5245880	So if you think the grass is greener over on YouTube, have fun when you take that Astro
5245880	5247800	turf injury in fall fall hard.
5248520	5253320	Well, I'm just saying right now with YouTube, they're doing I mean, and we're we can only
5253320	5254200	talk about the present.
5254200	5256360	I mean, obviously, we don't know what the future is going to hold.
5256360	5262600	But right now, the moves that they're making are seem to be benefiting content creators.
5262600	5266920	So they're adding a way to monetize shorts now.
5266920	5272840	And they're allowing, you know, ways to get more into a partner program with with the
5272840	5273880	shorts as well.
5273880	5280840	They're introducing a new music monetization system that you'll be able to license music,
5280840	5286120	like, and even with the shorts, you can use licensed music in your shorts.
5286120	5290040	So they're they're making it a little bit easier in that sense, you know, to do that.
5291480	5295400	Honestly, I probably will be streaming from YouTube, because Twitch does.
5295960	5299880	It's not really a growth avenue for me.
5300680	5305400	I think I think I have a better chance of getting revenue from YouTube than I do from
5305400	5306200	Twitch.
5306200	5307640	And that's totally fair.
5307640	5309560	You got to do what speaks to you.
5309560	5310200	Absolutely.
5311800	5315880	Let's see a entertainment says they monetize shorts to compete with TikTok and Instagram.
5315880	5316440	Yep.
5316440	5319800	Bobby Black Wolf says to be fair, Loki's audience is already on YouTube.
5319800	5320840	So makes sense to stream.
5320840	5321880	They're also true.
5322760	5324440	Let's see other comments here.
5325080	5329320	Take place game says Twitch is giving us numbers based on Amazon Web Services, which they
5329320	5331640	themselves fucking own is insulting.
5331640	5335640	Business wise, those costs are 100% written off as operating losses.
5335640	5337960	So Amazon can reduce their taxes anyway.
5337960	5340200	Oh, 100% don't pay any tax.
5340200	5348840	The messaging was so bad in how they delivered this news so bad that it really makes you
5348840	5353320	wonder if they even bothered to proofread the stinking product.
5353960	5358920	Godets and chat says I will say candidly, this sort of thing talking about a response
5358920	5361640	to fifth dream saying let's demand a return to Justin TV.
5361640	5364440	I will say candidly, this sort of thing screams opportunity.
5364440	5368200	YouTube's been falling flat on streaming service improvements, although they are trying.
5368200	5371080	I wonder if any other service can come around to eat Twitch.
5371080	5375960	Well, thank God Facebook has finally realized they aren't it because that was that was the
5375960	5378600	one service I did not want in this fucking.
5379320	5379640	Yeah.
5379640	5385080	And unfortunately, we need to have like Twitch to survive, too, because competition is the
5385080	5387560	only thing that's going to make these things better because the Twitch goes under.
5388200	5391160	Well, all that nice stuff with YouTube we were just talking about.
5391160	5392040	Bye bye.
5392040	5396120	And it was like there's a couple comments in chat talking about Mixer.
5396120	5401720	And I agree, like Mixer, I'm still a little surprised at how Mixer kind of finished.
5401720	5405720	I mean, yes, I guess there were management leadership problems at Mixer, but it's one
5405720	5413400	of those things where it's like, dang, like Mixer in the mix right now would really change
5413400	5414600	this game a lot.
5415160	5418840	I hope Microsoft, to some degree, still recognizes that.
5421960	5425720	Oh, for the record, I just turned off ads manager
5426680	5430840	and they gave me a big old survey to fill out because they want to know why.
5431560	5437480	And I think it's very interesting that that they're taking the feedback on it, like even
5437480	5440760	to the point, oh, you might win an Amazon gift card.
5440760	5441800	I'm like, I could use it right now.
5441800	5443560	I need all my, you know, cosplay stuff.
5444120	5447960	But the other thing on there, though, that I wish that they would switch to if they're
5447960	5452360	going to do ads are the stream display ads that they have.
5453640	5460120	Where your window gets a little bit smaller and you have a little banner underneath it
5460120	5461400	and it's not obtrusive.
5465000	5466680	You're not missing content.
5466680	5468520	Yeah, absolutely.
5469160	5471240	I want to get one more comment here from TayPlaysGames.
5471240	5474280	Now I got to move on because it's already an hour and a half in the show.
5474280	5476120	So we got to pick it up with these other news stories.
5476120	5477000	But this is good stuff.
5477000	5481000	I'm not, you know, we talk about what needs to be talked about.
5481560	5486760	TayPlaysGames says Facebook gaming was embarrassing, but I know multiple queer streamers were offered
5486760	5488680	one year Facebook gaming contracts.
5488680	5492360	They got their bag, held their tongues for a year, and now are back on Twitch.
5492360	5493880	I say make that paper, babes.
5494600	5495400	Absolutely.
5495400	5496280	Make that coin.
5496280	5500520	I mean, I'm not watching, but, you know, profit off other people do it.
5500520	5503080	Like, you know, take the moment.
5503880	5507000	Honestly, I still wouldn't have done it because I don't want to support Facebook.
5507000	5507480	Yeah.
5507480	5509480	Well, everybody's got a price.
5510200	5511720	I'm speaking for me anyway.
5511720	5513560	Would I would I have shut my fucking mouth?
5514520	5515320	For the right price.
5516520	5517720	So all right.
5517720	5518120	Well, yeah.
5518120	5520680	But then again, when's the last time I looked at my face?
5520680	5522760	But let's be clear, it's a high price.
5522760	5523560	Okay.
5523560	5524060	Yeah.
5525480	5526040	All right.
5526120	5531880	Like if they're going to pay me enough to be off work for a year and pay all my medical
5531880	5533640	bills, then yeah, I'll do that.
5533640	5535400	I'll take a leave of absence from work.
5535400	5538520	I'll stream for a year and then I'll shit talk them after.
5538520	5543080	If if I suddenly come around and I start saying, oh, I love Facebook.
5543080	5544200	Facebook's a great thing.
5544200	5546120	I can't wait to do more stuff.
5546120	5547720	I'm going to partner up with Facebook.
5547720	5549880	One of two things happened, I guarantee you.
5549880	5552520	Number one, somebody paid me a lot of money.
5552520	5555160	Number two, Zuckerberg is no longer the CEO.
5555160	5556440	One of those two things happened.
5557160	5559560	Blink once if they have you blink twice.
5560760	5561480	All right.
5561480	5567560	You know, what would be funny is to take that money and then put it toward the anti-Facebook
5567560	5568200	legislation.
5569480	5571080	Hey, all this money you gave us.
5571080	5575000	Yeah, we're going to use it to piss in your cornflakes, Facebook.
5575000	5575500	Just saying.
5576120	5577800	All right, let's move on.
5577800	5579720	Let's talk about some other gaming news.
5580360	5583800	We may have to touch on some of these a little bit faster just because we're already an hour
5583800	5584840	and a half into the show.
5585080	5587000	I want to get to this next story, which has to do.
5587000	5588600	And by the way, great discussion, everyone.
5588600	5593480	And I invite further discussion over on Twitter at twitter.com slash O L R.
5593480	5600760	Or you can also send us an email at participate at orange lounge radio.com.
5600760	5604200	Again, that's participate at orange lounge radio.com.
5604760	5610840	So moving on, let's talk about the Xbox Series X and a change that happened there.
5611640	5614840	The digital rights management for Xbox one games.
5614840	5620200	So if you have no access to playing Xbox one games, because it's trying to do an online
5620200	5625800	check to balance the digital rights management issues, then you no longer have to worry about
5625800	5628040	that with the latest Series X update.
5628040	5633880	This was confirmed by engineering lead Eda Marie and a tweet saying, yes, this is true.
5633880	5639160	Since the 2206 update, we examined data since Series X and S launch and determined that
5639160	5643800	the online compatibility check isn't needed in the vast majority of cases for Xbox one
5643800	5644440	discs.
5644440	5649800	Some games may still need to be updated online after install to ensure the best experience.
5649800	5653640	And that's, you know, we're talking about games with gigantic patches, like, say, No
5653640	5655000	Man's Sky, right?
5655000	5659400	Like that game just isn't going to play the same at all if you don't update it.
5659400	5661080	So there is that.
5663080	5663480	Let's see.
5665640	5667240	I think that's really all I want to say.
5667320	5672760	There are some other exceptions, like Forza Horizon 5 or Halo Infinite, because the discs
5672760	5674920	don't contain the full version of the game.
5674920	5679480	So you still need an internet connection to actually get the full versions of those games.
5679480	5683720	And we've seen that happen a lot where, you know, what does a disc really mean anymore?
5683720	5684200	Right.
5684200	5685800	So, yeah.
5686520	5688600	What's the list for this Xbox one games, though?
5689640	5690920	Yes, I thought I made that clear.
5690920	5692600	This is just for Xbox one games.
5692600	5697000	This does not affect any Series X thing that's always online.
5697720	5700440	I don't know how many of those really require always.
5700440	5704280	I mean, with so many games as a service these days and so forth, I don't know how many of
5704280	5705960	them really require always online.
5705960	5710360	But it is this is specifically addressing Xbox one related issues.
5711800	5712300	Yeah.
5712760	5714360	All right, moving on.
5714360	5715560	This is an interesting story.
5715560	5716200	Dark Sakura.
5717000	5723800	Yeah, well, and you know how I like to look into the bigger world of video games and how
5723800	5726440	it affects, you know, social elements.
5727560	5737800	So the Department of Homeland Security has given an almost $700,000 grant to terrorism
5737800	5743160	and security researchers to investigate radicalization through video games.
5744920	5749640	They're going to the Middlebury Institute Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism
5749640	5757160	or CTEC, which is a nonprofit organization called Take This and another company that's
5757160	5760680	looking to curb toxic behavior called Logically.
5762600	5766520	And I'll go ahead and read the quote from the grant announcement.
5766520	5771160	Over the past decade, video games have increasingly become focal points of social activity and
5771160	5774280	identity creation for adolescents and young adults.
5774280	5779080	Relationships made and fostered within game ecosystems routinely cross over into the real
5779080	5782520	world and are impactful parts of local communities.
5782520	5787400	Correspondingly, extremists have used video games and targeted video game communities
5787400	5791960	for activities ranging from propaganda creation to terrorist mobilization and training.
5792600	5798280	I'm going to take a sidestep on that one because I have been following the keffles situation
5799080	5801880	very, very actively.
5802520	5808600	And I honestly think that this goes into it with, you know, Kiwi farms.
5808680	5815640	They were, you know, sort of fostering those environments on their site and targeting a
5815640	5822760	lot of different streamers, different people that were active in the video game community
5822760	5824520	that are also activists.
5825240	5829560	So I think that that's a related item.
5829560	5830920	We've seen it very recently.
5831640	5840680	So one of the goals is that they want to monitor and evaluate extremist activities, and then
5840680	5849240	they want to train others for monitoring, detection, and prevention of, as I say, extremist
5849240	5856200	exploitation in gaming spaces for community managers, multiplayer designers, lore developers,
5856200	5859560	mechanic designers, and trust and safety professionals.
5861000	5872280	Um, they are looking at all kinds of different video game studios, you know, from big to
5872280	5880200	small that don't really understand how their games could be exploited for radicalization.
5881240	5887240	In fact, and then we've even seen this too, going back to the situation with Kiwi farms.
5887720	5893240	Um, white nationalists have been digging into gaming space.
5893240	5904520	There's groups on Steam that are openly neo-Nazi and, you know, glorifying, you know,
5905400	5908840	domestic terrorism, you know, like school shooters and the like.
5910360	5915400	When I look at this, though, I'm kind of like, I don't think this is the video game's fault.
5915400	5916840	This is the internet's fault.
5916840	5918840	This is internet radicalization.
5918840	5919160	All right.
5920360	5923960	And I think that they're dealing with one of the layers of it.
5923960	5926120	And I kind of see their approach on this one.
5927480	5931160	What they're wanting to do is like, while Steam has banned a lot of these groups,
5931160	5934120	these people want to go further and get them where they start.
5935880	5942680	They actually did a presentation at this year's Game Developers Conference
5943400	5949560	um, that their focus is going to be on the white nationalism supremacy front.
5950200	5959720	Um, because of a lot of the more racially motivated mass shootings, like the one in Buffalo.
5960440	5963240	Um, because that was broadcast on Twitch,
5965720	5970920	live with people dying and being injured on stream.
5971880	5980360	And I think that it's like you said, it's not just, you know, video games,
5980360	5987640	but I think that some of the online spaces around it have been hotbeds for negativity.
5988280	5994680	You know, we're, we're seeing, you know, just, just in general, you know, I mean,
5995160	6001080	the hate raids aside, I've been in my friends channels and had people come in and start
6001080	6008360	harassing them for their, uh, their sexual and gender orientation.
6008360	6017240	Um, I've actually had someone come in my channel and, and, uh, start spouting, uh, Nazi rhetoric.
6018920	6021800	Just because I have the Jewish label up on my channel.
6022680	6029000	I've had people come into my channel and tell me that I need hormone treatment because I'm ace.
6030600	6038120	Um, completely unsolicited, which I mean, 90% of it is unsolicited.
6038920	6045880	But, you know, for some of our, you know, my, uh, streamers of color, some of my friends,
6046520	6051320	they've, they've said there's a whole lot worse, of course, that comes in
6052840	6053880	and on their channel.
6053880	6065080	And, and I think the big thing, you know, on it is that it is something I'm glad that they're
6065080	6069240	looking at the sources and how it comes together.
6069800	6075080	Because I think if you can dismantle the, how the, the source of it,
6076200	6082440	you know, then to use, you know, the, the, the Hydra, you know, uh, analogy,
6082440	6085560	you know, you cut off one head and five more spawn.
6085560	6087720	Well, that's, you have to cut off the base.
6087720	6089800	That's what they're talking about in chat right now.
6089800	6091720	You know, talking about things like 4chan.
6092680	6095480	So going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,
6096280	6100760	says there are thousands of these site and platforms that are just cesspools and recruitment
6100760	6101400	centers.
6101400	6106120	For instance, if federal agencies don't have a massive team monitoring 4chan, like a hawk,
6106120	6107240	then they're doing it wrong.
6107960	6112120	But if they ever shut down 4chan, thousands of other ones will pop up in its place.
6112120	6115720	So diversifying their counterintelligence will hopefully stop more attacks.
6116920	6120280	I also think what Tay says here is a huge, important point.
6120280	6125240	And again, why, why my brain, like, I understand why they're looking at the gaming culture,
6125240	6127960	but my brain says this is an internet problem.
6127960	6129400	And this is huge.
6129400	6130600	What Tay is saying in chat.
6131160	6136360	Take place game says I'm less concerned about video games than I am about YouTube algorithms.
6136360	6142120	And I actually would personally, I would say any social media algorithm pushing out far
6142120	6147320	right content to kids, because this is something Facebook is also extremely guilty of is pushing
6147320	6153080	maybe less the targeting kids part, but bubbling that garbage and misinformation up.
6153080	6160760	And it's, you know, there's on all sides to they put it's that echo chamber of confirmation
6160760	6161480	bias.
6161480	6161980	Yes.
6162680	6169640	So that's that's what needs to be looked at is how we're bubbling the extremities to the
6169640	6170140	top.
6170920	6177800	And yeah, it's that's that's a bigger problem than any video game, in my opinion.
6177800	6183160	Well, and I think though, that they have to start somewhere.
6183720	6190600	And we, I think by, I'm not saying that it's right to target one community over another.
6191400	6197480	But, you know, they say that the, the, the bent nail gets hammered down first.
6198520	6206040	And I think that, of course, video games have often been the scapegoat of many of the people
6206040	6206540	in charge.
6207100	6213020	But the fact that we're actually seeing that they have evidence to support that this is a part
6213020	6216780	of it, then I think they have to start somewhere.
6216780	6217180	Yeah.
6217180	6227020	And on top of that, though, logically is actually a pretty, pretty good nonprofit that I'm not
6227020	6231580	nonprofit, but just company in general trying to curb the toxic behavior.
6231580	6242220	And also to add to this, I got an email from Intel about a service that they have to, to
6243340	6249980	combat online toxicity in online gaming and in gaming chats.
6250860	6254300	I joined in on that, although I haven't really seen anything more from it.
6254940	6265580	Um, but I think that it's also, it's sad that the government needs to step in on something
6266300	6269900	that people should just be putting down themselves.
6270540	6276700	You know, that's why I supported Kefl's attempts with, with Kiwi Farms and now they're gone
6276700	6278620	because a lot of us spoke up about it.
6279260	6283180	And I think that we need to be the louder voices, the voices of reason.
6283740	6286380	And, you know, call these people out.
6286380	6288460	Know what you're doing is not good.
6288460	6293420	You need to, you need to SDF you and, you know, go get that tree trunk out of your ass.
6294140	6295900	Or maybe you need something up your ass.
6295900	6296460	I don't know.
6296460	6297740	To this story's point.
6297740	6305500	Well, let's, let's not resort to that, but let's, you know, to this story's point, like,
6306460	6312700	and with the video game stuff, at least these things that happen on Twitch and so forth
6312940	6316940	in the gaming community and on Steam and in the space, at least they're trackable.
6316940	6319180	At least you can see them at least.
6319180	6323660	And so, so maybe I do understand why it does lure the government to that sort of space
6323660	6327180	to be able to actually see it and monitor it a little more effectively.
6327180	6331500	Because when I'm out playing Ingress and a car comes by and somebody leans out the
6331500	6335900	window and says faggot really loud out the window, that's not something that the government
6335900	6336940	can easily track.
6336940	6339020	And if I complain about that, that's happening.
6339020	6341980	That's just me being a baby and I need to grow a thicker skin.
6341980	6345100	And I'm sorry if you don't like that word, but I don't like that word either.
6345100	6348620	And I especially don't like it when it's yelled at me as it was in that situation that
6348620	6349980	happened in the past couple months.
6349980	6352140	Like I'm not talking about something that happened to me as a kid.
6352140	6356540	For me, that's something that happened to me as a 40 year old man out playing, you know,
6356540	6359980	Ingress and tapping my phone, which looks like Pokemon go.
6359980	6363020	So therefore I must be a lesser than that.
6363020	6367260	And that, and that's the issue when it really comes into stop being shits.
6367260	6371740	But unfortunately, if I yell back, don't be a shit, it's not heard.
6372460	6382460	Well, and the, the thing about it is that there, this is all coming back to a, trying
6382460	6383420	to think of the way to say it.
6383420	6387740	Cause I'm not going to say that it's a mental health thing, but I think it's the way that
6387740	6393420	people are being raised that there is this, and it's a very American thing.
6393420	6398620	I mean, I'm not saying that it's, it's isolated to America, but it is a very, very American
6398620	6409660	thing where if you don't fit in with this one mold, and I'm going to say it right now.
6409660	6422540	The quote default is white male, straight, cisgender, Christian, boring, vanilla person.
6422540	6423100	You know what I mean?
6424460	6426540	You know, that is default.
6426540	6432780	And this is something that as a female oriented person, I have grown up with my entire life
6432780	6438220	being told that I can't do something because it's something that a guy does, you know,
6439020	6442060	or, or that I'm going to be perceived a certain way.
6442060	6445740	And I'm sure that you have just like what that other person you've experienced that
6445740	6452860	way, it's society reinforcing the stereotype and it needs to start at home.
6452860	6453360	Yep.
6454060	6455580	It needs to start at home.
6455580	6461180	It needs parents to be better to their kids than their parents were to them.
6461180	6461680	Yeah.
6462140	6463580	They need to break the mold.
6464140	6466300	And, you know, thanks for the kind words and chat.
6466300	6467660	I see people saying, sorry, that happened.
6467660	6468140	That's fucked up.
6468140	6469580	And so I do appreciate that.
6469580	6474460	But like anyone who's different as dark star point out, anyone who has any element that's
6474460	6480060	against the norm, quote unquote has experienced something similar and it sucks.
6480060	6483100	And there's some that experience it a lot more often.
6483980	6488220	And there's some that, you know, I, I just, it's, it's a problem.
6488220	6493740	That's much bigger than what's, what, what's the video, what's the video game that's
6493740	6496620	causing people to just, just do terrible things.
6497260	6499660	It's, it's, it's no video game people.
6499660	6507020	No, it's people, but they're filtering it into games that have things to do with their
6507020	6508940	viewpoint, you know?
6508940	6511260	And I mean, but here's like a prime example.
6511260	6519740	If you go say on a running webpage, tips for men learning to run, you know, have a anti
6519740	6524780	chafe cream, you know, pick a good route, have good shoes.
6524780	6529340	Women carry a whistle, use your headphones, have mace with you.
6530780	6531820	Don't run at night.
6533660	6535900	You know, these double standards.
6535980	6541900	And I just use that because it's the example that I, that I live, but these double standards
6541900	6542700	are everywhere.
6542700	6545900	And that's why I'm saying it's a mold that needs to be broken.
6545900	6548300	It's built into our language.
6548300	6549660	I know I've mentioned it before.
6549660	6554620	I have a book I'm very fond of called manmade language by an Australian woman named Dale
6554620	6555100	Spender.
6555660	6557420	There are multiple versions of this book.
6557420	6561340	She started it as her, I think her doctorate thesis in the seventies.
6562300	6571340	But everything is built around this, this mold of straight white male, Christian, cisgender
6572380	6573660	language is built that way.
6574220	6579180	And I'm so glad that right now we have new terms being introduced.
6579180	6583500	We have new concepts that are coming that there's a good number of people adopting.
6584060	6587820	We're whittling away at it, but we need to do more.
6587820	6588620	We need to do more.
6589580	6594060	Uh, fifth three men chat says I'm in quote, he fingers default in this country.
6594060	6597900	And even me and my friends were threatened with weapons because we had nail polish and
6597900	6598700	eyeliner on.
6598700	6601580	I can't imagine what a lot of people have to go through.
6601580	6605180	And it's, it's the fact that you kind of play.
6605180	6609420	I mean, it was one could argue that the nail polish and eyeliner is, is gender expression
6609420	6610700	and playing with that a little bit.
6610700	6614620	Although I don't think that stuff has to be the mold.
6614620	6615900	Yeah, exactly, exactly.
6616380	6619900	And to reinforce, I don't think those things have to be tied to any gender, but I think
6619900	6620940	we understand that.
6622540	6626940	Most of America does view that stuff as, as gender roles and you, you were outside of
6626940	6627500	that.
6627500	6631100	So, um, that's, that's why that happened masculinity.
6631100	6631500	Yeah.
6631500	6632000	Yeah.
6632620	6638060	Toxic masculinity hurts men as much as it hurts everybody else.
6638060	6641340	People in that mold, you know, it's, it's.
6643180	6645420	It's just, it's sick.
6645500	6648140	It's a sickness in society.
6648140	6655500	And sadly, the sickness has been building for centuries, you know, for millennia.
6657260	6658620	And we need to be better than it.
6658620	6663820	We need to actually show that we need to be enlightened people and we need to learn from
6663820	6667020	the past, but, oh no, learning from the past.
6667020	6668940	What is this past thing you speak of?
6668940	6670780	I don't want to think about these negative things.
6670780	6675260	I'd rather be comfortable in my little mold that keeps me on top of the food chain.
6676380	6677740	Sounds too progressive for me.
6678940	6680780	All right, moving on.
6680780	6681900	We do have a time.
6682460	6685580	I wouldn't say constraint, but we are running a little long tonight, so I want to keep the
6685580	6686700	news going.
6686700	6688300	So let's get to our next story.
6688300	6688800	Loki.
6689500	6689740	Yeah.
6689740	6694220	Let's talk about, uh, another thing that also had the government coming after people.
6694220	6703580	Well, I would assume, um, so Rockstar Games leak of Grand Theft Auto six, um, of course
6703580	6704860	attracted a lot of attention.
6706060	6711260	So, of course, they were locking, uh, Rockstar was locking social media.
6712380	6721100	Um, apparently on the 18th of September, uh, GTA forums, uh, there was, um, I think they
6721100	6728940	also did some, uh, they were, uh, taking down, of course, the poster of these leaks, um,
6728940	6733660	their accounts on GTA forums, which isn't really owned by Rockstar Games, but whatever.
6733660	6742700	Um, and then of course, uh, there was also, um, different, uh, locked posts, like with
6742700	6747580	tweets and Instagram posts that were taken down, uh, DMCA type stuff as well.
6747580	6751740	So they were trying to, you know, kind of get a hold of any of the videos that were
6751740	6753180	being out, you know, spread out there.
6753180	6754780	They were taking those all down.
6755340	6763340	Um, and then we have news that the city of London police have, uh, posted that on Thursday,
6763580	6770220	22nd, they have arrested a 17 year old, um, in Oxford on suspicion of hacking as part
6770220	6777420	of the investigation into, uh, was it the Uber and Rockstar Games hacks.
6777420	6782460	Apparently this person was believed to be connected with the group, uh, lapses.
6783260	6790460	And they had, um, apparently hacked lots of different companies, including, uh, Microsoft,
6790460	6799100	Cisco, Samsung, Nvidia, and Okta, and even, um, uh, the Brazil, Brazil's Ministry of Health
6799100	6799600	as well.
6800220	6806060	So no word if that's necessarily the right person that was responsible for all this,
6806060	6813180	but, um, they did catch somebody who I think they, that their information also been docked
6813180	6813420	out.
6813420	6815100	Allegedly someone said they were high.
6815100	6817980	I don't know, too much stuff going around, hard to know what to believe.
6818620	6822300	Uh, but that is not the end of the hacks.
6822300	6828380	So apparently take two, um, not having the best of luck, but, uh, according to a post
6828380	6832700	on the official two K support Twitter, I think something is coming up later in the show on
6832700	6833580	this actually.
6833580	6835900	So we'll probably talk about that a little later.
6836860	6837580	Okay.
6837580	6837900	All right.
6837900	6839100	Well then that's it.
6839100	6846220	But the, um, uh, part about the hack and so forth with grand theft auto six, um, is very
6846220	6851580	interesting, um, that the, the person that reported this is, is somebody I've known online
6851580	6856300	for a long time, and they're very in tune with internet culture.
6856300	6860540	Um, so it was very, very interesting to see, um, this all kind of come out.
6860540	6866380	Uh, I, I'm very curious, like where, uh, that was all kind of figured out and how that was,
6866380	6870140	uh, you know, this particular individual was responsible.
6870140	6874940	I guess we'll see her more in the coming weeks as we start to see, uh, some of the, um, um,
6875900	6878140	you know, court stuff that may come out of it.
6878860	6879980	Yeah, we'll have to see, I guess.
6881100	6881820	All right.
6881820	6887660	Well, um, along similar lines, talking about, um, the rockstar and so forth, uh, and what
6887660	6893260	they've been going through, uh, some developers have actually, uh, I want to say they're sort
6893260	6900140	of showing support for rockstar by bagging on internet, internet, uh, tweeters and people
6900140	6904140	that have really shit opinions, uh, with some of this stuff, actually aren't really dumb
6904140	6905180	opinions, honestly.
6905180	6910220	Like, seriously, it's just like these people, I guess, don't know how video game development
6910220	6910620	works.
6910620	6911660	No, they don't.
6911660	6917660	So for example, um, character artists, Xavier, uh, Cole, ho call Stoney.
6917660	6918460	I hope I said that right.
6918460	6922460	I'm sorry, but they are a character artists for ratchet and clank, rift apart, 3d.
6922460	6927980	And they wrote a tweet that said, this is the greatest extremely confident, but has
6927980	6929820	no idea what they're talking about.
6929820	6931500	Take I've ever seen.
6931500	6933660	And it was in reply to a, it was a screen.
6933740	6935340	Oh, I love that they did this right too.
6935340	6939740	They screenshotted the tweet instead of quote, tweeting it to prevent the tweet from getting
6939740	6942140	further engagement and the screenshot.
6942140	6945180	And I'm not going to say who tweeted it because they don't deserve to have their account.
6945180	6951100	Shout it out said, if you knew how game development goes, you'd know that visuals are one of the
6951100	6952540	first things done.
6952540	6955260	This game is four years into planning and development.
6955260	6958540	What you see is almost exactly what you will get this.
6958540	6961900	The next year is mission coding and debugging all backend stuff.
6961900	6969180	It does look ass and that unleash the floodgates of this new man, since graphics are the first
6969180	6970540	thing finished in a video game.
6971820	6976700	And so the developers of control actually showed what control looked like early on with
6976700	6983260	these giant boxes that said, throw me as part of what was the environment there.
6984140	6987740	The naughty dog tweeted out what last of us look like in development.
6988700	6994060	The cult of the lamb developers even tweeted out a screenshot with the meme graphics of
6994060	6997580	the first things finished in a video game that showed what the video game looked like
6997580	7002140	in a very early state where a lot of the graphics were very rough and not quite polished at
7002140	7002940	that point.
7002940	7004300	And so on and so on.
7004300	7012060	Game developers around the world have come together to dunk on dumb ass tweets that pretend
7012060	7016860	they know what goes into game development when in fact they know nothing about it.
7016940	7019980	And that's a lot of Twitter opinions, unfortunately, we see in these day and age.
7019980	7021820	So I'm glad this person is getting dunked on.
7022940	7023980	Say something too.
7023980	7026060	It's not just video game development.
7026060	7030620	If I'm doing a graphic layout, I'm going to use a shitload of placeholders.
7030620	7034620	I will use low res pictures to save on my work.
7034620	7039420	When I'm working on video editing, I'll use what's called proxy media, where instead
7039420	7046140	of using my very big, very slow 4K footage, I'm using like 720p placeholders.
7046140	7052300	You know, it makes sense that when you are starting a layout, you do not start with your
7052300	7053020	best stuff.
7053020	7056860	You start by putting a foundation down.
7056860	7058220	You start with your engine.
7058220	7059580	You start with your play.
7059580	7061100	You start with your physics.
7061100	7062780	The graphics are going to come after.
7062780	7066780	Every movie starts with a storyboard, right?
7066780	7070940	And before a frame of footage is shot, even in my job when putting together, you know,
7070940	7074060	things that have, because I do layouts with PowerPoints and the guides and so forth.
7074620	7077900	I use a site similar to Shutterstock for like art.
7077900	7079580	It's not that one, but it's a different one.
7079580	7086300	And so what I'll actually do, I put in the art with the fricking, the watermark on it
7086300	7091340	and everything ugly and so forth, just as a placeholder so that people can see this
7091340	7094140	is the art that we're going to use if this is approved.
7094140	7098140	And then once it's approved, then we pay for the art, get it in and put it all in there.
7098140	7100460	So we're all clear with, you know, copyright and all that stuff.
7100620	7103660	The art was done before you started that PowerPoint.
7103660	7104780	No, it wasn't.
7104780	7108460	No, I'm saying a low version was done while the content is being reviewed.
7108460	7111260	But it was on Shutterstock, therefore it was done before.
7111260	7113020	I said it wasn't Shutterstock, but sure.
7113020	7114140	Or whatever.
7114140	7114700	All right.
7114700	7115100	Anyway.
7115980	7116460	All right.
7116460	7119820	And lots of people making other analogies in chat, but I think we all get it.
7119820	7122780	This tweeter had no idea what they were talking about.
7122780	7129020	I'm also going to say this too, is that when you're working in the art production side
7129020	7134540	of it, you're not going to start with having a pretty finished model at all either.
7134540	7141180	You're going to make your skeleton, you're going to have a rough blob model that you
7141180	7149100	were going to mold into the shape and then fine tune, you know, your model.
7149100	7153660	And this comes from someone who has done 3D modeling and ended up with a cat taking his
7153660	7154700	shit by accident.
7155420	7163180	Um, you're, it's one, it's all, you've got to build from, from a foundation.
7163180	7163980	You've got a blank.
7165980	7166380	No, you're fine.
7167020	7167980	This is pet peeve.
7167980	7174540	I wanted to see if this particular individual kind of doubled down on their comments or
7174540	7175900	apologized for them.
7175900	7177820	So I went to their Twitter account.
7177820	7178460	It's locked.
7181100	7181740	So anyway.
7182460	7184460	They did the run and hide method.
7184860	7187260	They fucked around and they found out.
7188140	7188460	All right.
7189260	7190620	Moving on next story.
7191580	7193100	I think Dark Soccer, we're back to you.
7193660	7194620	I can't with people.
7194620	7195980	I'm just saying right now.
7195980	7197340	So how about something better?
7197900	7202460	Um, y'all, y'all remember the nineties when we had Blockbuster?
7203100	7204300	I try to forget, but sure.
7204300	7205260	No, the nineties were awesome.
7206300	7208540	Yeah, we had good music in the nineties.
7208540	7216140	Um, anyway, though, uh, the Blockbuster World Video Game Championships is coming back.
7217180	7220140	In fact, it's supposed to be back in October.
7221020	7222620	So they have the one store?
7224460	7231500	Well, no, let me, so the Blockbuster World Video Game Championship three is going to
7231500	7237660	take place October 14th through 16th hosted by Portland Retro Gaming Expo and DoubleJump
7237660	7243100	events, and they want to, basically it's free to enter.
7243100	7247980	They just want to make some new memories, but they are teaming up with Blockbuster to
7247980	7253100	recreate a video, the video rental store for the weekend.
7253900	7259820	There is the Blockbuster experience room where they can pick up an updated Blockbuster card
7259820	7264780	and meet the general manager for the last Blockbuster on the planet, Sandy Harding.
7265580	7271180	Um, they have one store left, one store left.
7271180	7272300	Yeah, and it's in Oregon.
7272300	7273900	It's, it's not near Portland.
7273900	7276700	It's in the Southeast part of Oregon, but it's, it's there.
7277340	7280380	But the prizes are, I mean, they're okay.
7280380	7286060	You get a $1,000 PRGE exhibitor hall shopping spree.
7286620	7290940	Second and third place will respectively get $500 and $250.
7291900	7293420	Um, there will be two rounds.
7293420	7298940	Round one will go against each other in Saturn Bomberman, which is a very good version of
7298940	7299500	Bomberman.
7300060	7303580	Um, the first player to win three battles moves on to round two.
7303580	7309900	Round two will be a high score on Downfall OG Plus for the Atari Jaguar.
7311100	7320860	And then, um, and, uh, I, I mean, it's not a good Jaguar.
7321020	7321340	Game.
7321340	7324940	I'm just saying, but Saturn Bomberman is great.
7325660	7333900	I, I, I wonder if any of these, uh, people actually are, have played Saturn Bomberman
7333900	7337660	or have played a Bomberman question mark, maybe.
7338380	7347100	Um, but I mean, there were the original, um, Blockbuster, uh, world championship.
7347100	7350220	People would compete in these different stores across the US.
7350940	7356140	And then the store champions who were the winners would go on to compete at Gamepro's
7356140	7357820	headquarters in San Francisco.
7358380	7359820	I know I competed in that, it was fun.
7361020	7363900	Yeah, I think I did once.
7365180	7370300	Was it NBA, NBA Jam and Ninja Turtles Tournament Fighters?
7371340	7371660	Yeah.
7371660	7373980	Now Turtles Tournament Fighters was the one I was good at.
7373980	7375260	I suck at NBA Jam.
7375260	7377740	Or was it, was it both games or was that two different?
7377820	7380940	I thought it was, I want to say that it was both.
7381820	7385980	It's, I, I, I don't remember.
7387580	7389980	We always went to Hollywood video, so I don't.
7392380	7394460	You know what I found very recently?
7394460	7397100	I found my laminated Blockbuster card.
7398700	7403820	The Blockbuster nostalgia is completely lost on me because they did something to piss my
7403820	7407020	mom off because my mom was a movie buff.
7407020	7407980	She loved movies.
7407980	7410620	She loved obscure ass fucking foreign films.
7410620	7411580	That was her favorite.
7412460	7415260	And, um, she, but she hated Blockbuster.
7415260	7415740	Like they did.
7416220	7420460	I think she was mad at Blockbuster because Blockbuster required her to have a credit
7420460	7422860	card and she's like, and this was just my mother.
7422860	7427980	If you knew her, she was very much like, I'm not giving my credit card information to anyone.
7427980	7430460	They can, they can suck it basically.
7430460	7436620	So, um, but for whatever reason, I can't say and commit, you know, that that was the
7436620	7440220	absolutely the reason, but all I know is that Blockbuster did something to piss her off.
7440220	7441500	So we never went there.
7441500	7446940	It was always Hollywood video or her favorite, her favorite place to rent movies was the
7446940	7447580	warehouse.
7448140	7451100	For those that remember that it rented movies there.
7451100	7452380	Oh yeah, they did.
7452380	7453500	Yeah, they did.
7453500	7457180	I don't, what were all, what with the warehouse was in with all these other brands too, but
7457180	7459580	the warehouse was, yeah, they rented a lot of movies.
7460140	7463900	It was a big, it was a big, um, tape and CD store.
7464540	7466860	Two back in the, that's where I bought my first PlayStation two.
7466860	7472860	When I would go visit granny and Dothan, Alabama, we would go rent from the Curtis Mathis.
7474540	7476220	Who remembers Curtis Mathis?
7476220	7477020	We didn't have him here.
7477020	7477520	So no.
7478140	7483260	Well, I mean, it was mostly to sell the electronics, but they had like a wall of movies and I saw
7483260	7489420	some weird shit, but I think I rented return of the Jedi, like so many times, so many times.
7490060	7497260	But we had, we had a few different like local rental places that would get like the really
7497260	7500620	good nest games that I would rent from.
7500620	7503820	And then I rented a turbo graphics from a couple of times.
7506060	7512220	So I'm trying to do the quick poll of a YouTube or not YouTube Wikipedia to see what it is.
7512860	7519100	Warehouse had purchased blockbuster music from Viacom at 1998, but I can't figure out,
7519100	7520620	it doesn't say what the other stores were.
7520620	7524460	I guess the warehouse was unique to California.
7524460	7527820	I thought they were in with other birds until you mentioned it just now.
7527820	7528320	Yeah.
7528780	7533420	So wasn't there like another one that was like the warehouse that was in the mall.
7533420	7535260	I'm trying to think what that was now.
7535260	7537660	It was like FYE, FYE, that type of thing.
7537660	7538460	It wasn't FYE.
7538460	7539500	I, yeah, I remember that.
7539500	7542860	That was very much like the warehouse, but there was also another one that was smaller.
7543420	7548060	So dark Sakura, do you know, and I apologize to the listeners for getting extremely local,
7548060	7549900	but tangents, they happen.
7549900	7554700	Do you know out in Roseville where the Mongolian barbecue is that a lot of people like in the
7554700	7559260	TJ Maxx Plaza and there's the, there's the learn we used to go to.
7559260	7559580	Yes.
7559580	7564060	And there's the learning, the learning store, the Lake shore learning center, that place
7564060	7565340	that used to be the warehouse.
7566300	7566700	No.
7566700	7567100	Okay.
7567100	7568060	And that's yeah.
7568860	7572620	Going way back, throwback for the record.
7572620	7574060	One, one little tangent.
7574380	7574880	Hmm.
7575260	7580940	When I, when we saw Weird Al last night, he kept talking about tower records and I, but
7580940	7583420	I was here to experience the tower records.
7583420	7588540	They bulldozed the tower building here or not, not the, not the theater, but the record
7588540	7589820	store across the street is gone.
7589820	7592540	The one that used to be dimple then it, they know it's gone.
7592540	7593420	They bulldozed it.
7594380	7594860	I know.
7594860	7595100	Right.
7595100	7596140	That's like me.
7596140	7598220	That isn't the original tower records.
7598220	7603020	Cause technically the original, the original tower records is now tower cafe because tower
7603020	7606620	cafes, indoor portion was a drug store and tower records started in the back of that
7606620	7607420	drug store.
7607420	7611100	So if you're eating at the back table in tower cafe, you're eating at the original tower
7611100	7611820	records.
7611820	7619900	But the watt location was the first actual retail full tower records location.
7619900	7621260	And now it's a Goodwill.
7621260	7624140	And they actually have the old tower signs still in the back of the Goodwill.
7624780	7629100	So yeah, that I, that I remember I like go and that's a really good Goodwill as well.
7629100	7629420	Yeah.
7629420	7632460	Um, you know, the last time I went to the tower theater, I think it was with you to
7632460	7633420	see the shape of water.
7634140	7634700	Oh yeah.
7634700	7636060	That was a few years ago.
7636060	7636380	Wow.
7636380	7636700	All right.
7637420	7640460	Less tangents, more news, two hours, 10 minutes.
7640460	7642540	We haven't even gotten to the classic game.
7642540	7643420	Let's go.
7643420	7643820	All right.
7644620	7645180	Loki.
7645180	7646780	Just do anything tonight.
7646780	7648220	I'm just here for the ride.
7649500	7651260	You're helping make the show long.
7651260	7653260	So fine with that.
7653260	7655420	You know, fewer Weskers.
7656060	7663580	Uh, so we're back to talking about, um, this lawsuit between the destiny to cheat makers
7663580	7664780	and bungee.
7665420	7670060	Um, you may remember last time they were saying that the lawsuit was frivolous.
7670060	7674380	That was of course, the claims that were made by aim junkies, which is a website, I guess
7674380	7677900	it's owned by a group called a Phoenix digital group.
7678700	7686780	Um, now they're claiming in a counter suit that bungee had access and downloaded files
7686780	7690460	on the personal computer of the defendant, James May.
7691340	7701980	Um, so basically saying that he was hacked by bungee, um, that also that bungee used
7701980	7705580	the information obtained to conduct further surveillance on the group as well.
7706220	7713260	So we'll see, um, hacked by bungee is going to be the name of my first album.
7714700	7718220	I don't believe it, but we'll, we'll see what we'll see.
7719100	7721820	It's an interesting, um, strategy.
7721820	7723500	We'll have to see if it pays off.
7723500	7723740	Yeah.
7723740	7728860	We'll have to see, uh, we'll have to see what comes up in court with that whole situation.
7728860	7729360	Huh?
7730300	7730380	Yeah.
7730380	7730860	All right.
7731020	7731260	Yeah.
7731260	7731580	All right.
7732300	7737580	Well, uh, moving on, let's talk about, uh, a little more about those Atari recharged
7737580	7739980	games I sort of referenced during my gaming week.
7739980	7743340	So Atari recharged games, some of the ones that have already been released are going
7743340	7744700	to get new content.
7744700	7749100	Now, this article I'm looking at specifically speaks to the Nintendo switch, but a lot of
7749100	7750940	these games are also on the PC.
7750940	7755340	So I'm not sure at the PI, but I tried to search other news sites and I couldn't find
7755340	7760540	the news if this was coming to switch as well, or I'm sorry, steam PC as well.
7760540	7762060	But we do know it's coming to switch.
7762060	7768460	So asteroids, centipede breakout, black widow, and gravatar, all those recharged versions
7768460	7770780	are going to be getting new content on the switch.
7770780	7777100	It's bonus challenge levels that were previously only available on the Atari VCS.
7777100	7779660	And that may be the reason why it's not completely in steam.
7779660	7780140	I don't know.
7780940	7785580	But they are a very high level of difficulty for these, and it will be new challenges for
7785580	7789900	existing players and additional value to anyone who's getting the titles for the first
7789900	7791740	time arcade mode.
7791740	7794620	Oh, and this is exactly what dark Tetsuya was talking about earlier.
7794620	7799260	Arcade mode will now give you three lives instead of one, just like the coin op games
7799260	7800060	they are based on.
7800060	7801020	So that's fun.
7801020	7806380	And a new arachnophobia mode is coming to black widow recharged, and that will turn
7806380	7808460	the spider into a frosty snowman.
7809260	7812220	And you're shooting snowflakes instead of webs.
7812220	7817660	That's actually so like, it's not it literally is for people who have arachnophobia.
7817660	7824620	You can change it away from spiders into, I guess, Sonic Christmas Nights, where now
7824620	7828060	you're playing a Christmas themed game or whatever.
7828060	7829020	So it's fun.
7829660	7831820	All right, so that's neat.
7831820	7833340	Look for that on the switch eShop.
7834140	7834460	All right.
7835180	7839660	Meanwhile, since I brought up Atari, I think it's a good time for us to talk about other
7839660	7842140	classic games in this segment.
7842140	7845340	Except I forgot my button pushing device doesn't work.
7845340	7849740	So let me try that transition again and we'll go to this next segment.
7872140	7877980	And here we have one of those games that I can't believe it's 10 years old.
7877980	7878700	But here we are.
7880540	7881260	Dark Sakura.
7881900	7882700	Skullgirls.
7884460	7891340	Skullgirls is a 2D fighting game that was developed by Revenge Labs and published by
7891340	7892300	Autumn Games.
7893180	7906540	The game came out on April 10th, 2012, and it's pretty fun.
7907180	7913580	The game was first released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live and was so positively
7913580	7917500	received that it expanded, it got more characters, etc.
7918060	7926780	So the premise of the game is that you will fight each other, either teams of one, two,
7926780	7929260	or three characters and knock out your opponents.
7930700	7935260	Whoever has the most cumulative health when the time runs out too, just like any fighting
7935260	7935500	game.
7936860	7943100	But the setting is about a skull heart, which is an artifact that grants wishes for women.
7944060	7950300	If a wish with an impure soul uses a skull heart, she turns into a monster called a Skullgirl.
7953340	7960540	And it's a pretty, pretty, pretty interesting game, although it did have some setbacks.
7960540	7969900	Autumn Games in May 2012 was sued over allegations of fraud about an unreleased property, Def
7970460	7976060	Jam Rapstar, which cut off some of Skullgirls financial support.
7977100	7979420	They had to lay off the entire development team.
7979980	7985900	The core team reformed as Lab Zero Games in November 2012.
7985900	7991740	And after crowdfunding, they raised enough money to continue their work and they developed
7991740	7996940	the Windows version released by Marvelous in August of 2013.
7997660	8003900	And then Autumn Games severed their ties with Konami in December 2013.
8005900	8011100	And so Konami requested to have the game removed from the PlayStation and Xbox storefronts.
8011900	8019100	The game was re-released in 2014 as Skullgirls Encore, ported to PS4 and PC in 2015, where
8019100	8021900	it was renamed as Skullgirls Second Encore.
8022620	8028540	And then another version in the Japanese arcades and Vita came out.
8029100	8035740	For the record, the arcade version is on a Taito type X squared system.
8037580	8044460	But then we've had like the Switch version in October 2019, Xbox One and Xbox Series
8044460	8047820	X releases are planned for this year.
8047820	8049340	I don't know if they're already out.
8049340	8056300	And then Skullgirls Mobile was developed by Hidden Variable Studios and released for iOS
8056300	8058060	and Android in 2017.
8058860	8063660	And it's all over the place.
8066620	8070220	So there, of course, is some drama.
8071340	8077660	Autumn Games and Hidden Variable Studios severed ties with Lab Zero Games after sexual harassment
8077660	8082620	allegations raised against the lead designer and programmer Mike Zimon.
8083740	8086220	And so they were dissolved.
8086220	8092780	And then some of the former members created a new studio called Future Club, collaborating
8092780	8097020	with Hidden Variable Studios for future content for a second Encore.
8097980	8108540	So basically, the model for the engine was based off of Marvel versus Capcom 2, with
8108540	8114620	several of their game mechanics, like the tag team combat, character assists, delayed
8114620	8116300	hyper combos, etc.
8117260	8124460	And you can play with different ratios very similarly to Capcom versus SNK 2, where you
8124460	8129340	can select up to three fighters on the team, but your life and power is bound.
8131820	8143580	So you'd have either a variety of characters with less power in life each, or you can just
8143580	8145740	have your favorite, your champion.
8147020	8153340	The game has story mode, arcade mode versus mode, training room, a tutorial mode, and
8153340	8156300	online play using GGPO Network Library.
8157660	8166060	It also, it had some different features that looked at system and balance issues, such
8166060	8167900	as infinite combo detection.
8169580	8174220	And then it offered protection against unblockable attacks.
8174220	8180460	So, for example, when a person uses a low hitting move and a high hitting assist attack,
8181420	8189420	they have ways of blocking that by giving a period of unblockable protection after successfully
8189420	8190300	blocking an attack.
8192220	8199420	So they were really just, you know, focused.
8199420	8202060	They always had updates for it.
8202060	8207660	They had different add-ons, like faster gameplay, the online training, like I said before, a
8207740	8218220	stun meter, and they also had a local game mode called Typing of the Skullcurl, similarly
8218220	8219740	to Typing of the Dead.
8219740	8228540	And so the teams would generate meter and attacks based on their typing accuracy.
8229900	8235580	It's fully voiced story modes, cross-platform play across the entire PlayStation family,
8236220	8242380	Second Encore brought in different challenges where you have unique battle conditions, different
8242380	8251180	trials, different combo challenges, an endless survival mode, different RPG progression
8251180	8253820	tactics, customization, deck building.
8255740	8261980	So as far as the characters go, you had initially eight playable characters.
8261980	8270860	You had Felia Medici, who has a hair parasite named Samson, which we're seeing, well, we
8270860	8273260	were seeing that play.
8276300	8288620	There's a circus performer named Sara Bella, an anti-skull-bruel cyborg named Patricia
8288620	8297180	Peacock Watson and Painwill, who we're seeing in there, Princess Parasoul Renoir, Nadia
8297180	8303820	Fortune, and then Valentine, and then the shape-shifting demon called Double.
8305660	8310540	And then after the Indiegogo crowdfunding, there were five new characters named Sienna
8310540	8319020	Squiggly Cantiello, who is a zombie, along with Leviathan, an anti-skull-girl cyborg
8319020	8321420	named Benjamin Big Band Birdland.
8321980	8322940	I think that's funny.
8324060	8330460	A parasite called Eliza, a wrestler called Beowulf, and another anti-skull-girl android
8330460	8332060	called Robo Fortune.
8332060	8335820	A clone Ophelia named Fukua was added to the game later.
8336380	8342220	She was there for an April Fool's Day joke, and then everyone wanted to keep her.
8342220	8345500	There were more characters added for season one pass.
8345500	8354460	The character Annie, Parasoul's sister Umbrella, Black Dahlia, and Skullgirl Marie.
8355260	8362140	So it's been lauded so much.
8362140	8370220	And I already talked about the drama earlier, so I'm not going to go too much more into
8370220	8373180	that, but the game also...
8374380	8378700	The publishers also talked about a fifth DLC, Fighter, other free content.
8378700	8382220	They're still supporting this game like you would not believe.
8383740	8391900	But for the music, the original album had 28 compositions done by Yamane Michiru.
8392540	8396460	Vincent Diamante, Blaine McGurdy, and Brenton Cossack.
8397820	8403900	And you can still buy the whole soundtrack, although if you did $10 to the Indiegogo campaign,
8403900	8407900	you get a digital copy of the soundtrack, or if you did more, you get a physical release
8407900	8408220	of it.
8411260	8418060	And basically with Yamane, she contributed for work in the Castlevania series.
8418780	8424780	And so they really wanted her in there, and they wanted a jazzy theme.
8424780	8431020	In fact, you can even see that with the Showtime right at the beginning.
8432940	8436460	And it's been very, very popular.
8439500	8447100	The game received very, very high Metacritic scores, the lowest of them being a 71 for
8447100	8452380	iOS, the highest being an 82 for PS3.
8456460	8460700	Everyone's given them some pretty high-level ratings.
8463180	8468860	It was the highest selling game on Xbox Live Arcade when it was released, and the third
8468860	8472060	best selling on PlayStation Network for April 2012.
8472060	8474940	In Japan, the game took off so well.
8477980	8487660	It's been well-loved, and for a little bit of legacy information, 2019 Anime Expo, there
8487660	8496780	was a webcomic published by Webtoon, and at EVO 2022, Skullgirls was added as a main event
8496780	8497100	game.
8498140	8500140	And that's it, Skullgirls.
8500940	8503740	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Skullgirls.
8503740	8505180	I love this game.
8505180	8506860	Again, it's one of those things where it's like, really?
8506860	8508700	This is already 10 years old?
8508700	8509260	Ouch.
8509260	8513820	But then a lot of people are also saying, the graphics of this game hold up very well.
8514700	8520860	And part of that is probably the support, but also it's a very well-drawn and put-together
8520860	8521260	game.
8521260	8523020	I was going to say, the hand-drawn stuff is what holds up.
8523020	8525340	No one's surprised that Sonic Box succeeded at it.
8525340	8526140	Yeah, yeah.
8526860	8528860	All right, so awesome, awesome.
8528860	8532060	Skullgirls is your classic game of the week.
8532060	8533740	All right, we're going to move on.
8533740	8537420	We have plenty more show to come, although we'll probably do a lot of these stories
8537420	8538540	rapid-fire style.
8538540	8544300	But I want to make sure we have time for any calls over in our green room, vognetwork.com
8544300	8547820	slash discord, if you want to join our green room and possibly join us on the air for a
8547820	8548620	discussion tonight.
8549180	8551980	But we still have a little ways before we're going to get to those calls, because first,
8551980	8556060	we need to get through rapid-fire news and talk about some other headlines quickly.
8556060	8556620	So, Loki.
8558380	8560460	So we got a tease of a tease.
8560460	8567500	So there's a post by New York Comic-Con that says, join us for October 6th at 4 p.m.
8567500	8573180	Eastern Time for the teaser trailer premiere of the Super Mario Brothers movie.
8573180	8575740	Not the old one, the brand new one by Illumination.
8576380	8579420	So we're going to get a trailer for that soon.
8579420	8585500	I will be in a pressurized tube 30,000 feet above the Earth's surface at the time that
8585500	8589180	this trailer drops, and I don't think there is any place I would rather be.
8591340	8599660	Uh, and then, uh, we've also got news that Borderlands game, uh, spinoff Tiny Tina's
8599660	8601980	Wonderland is now going to be a franchise.
8602540	8607100	So they're going to spin it off because it did so well, which is great because we need
8607100	8608300	more Borderlands type games.
8608300	8610620	And I hear this one was good and I still haven't played it.
8610620	8615580	I know, and I keep waiting for that deep sale, but I imagine by the time, you know, November
8615580	8616860	is around the corner.
8616860	8619980	And so by the time we get to November, this game will be 1999.
8619980	8621820	So I'll probably finally pick it up.
8621820	8622320	Probably.
8623260	8623760	All right.
8624220	8624860	Uh, there's soccer.
8626140	8631180	Oh, um, the studio behind Dead Space is making an Iron Man game with Marvel.
8631740	8636860	Um, that's Motive Studio and they're doing a single player, third person action game
8636860	8638620	starring Iron Man.
8639500	8640000	Yay.
8640540	8644300	It was only, you know, very quietly confirmed on Twitter.
8645500	8646460	I'm excited.
8646460	8647020	Yeah.
8647020	8647820	Yeah, it could be good.
8648780	8649420	All right.
8649420	8655820	And, uh, we do have some incoming quality of life updates for the Capcom Fighting Collection,
8655820	8660940	uh, which, uh, or if it's me, it's the Puzzle Fighter II and some fighting games collection.
8660940	8665580	But hey, uh, the quality of life update is hitting this week on Tuesday, September the
8665580	8666140	27th.
8666860	8668700	All the patch notes are not available yet.
8668700	8675020	However, this is supposed to include viewable hit boxes, new gem colors for Puzzle Fighter.
8675020	8678700	I think this is to address some colorblind issues and make the game more accessible.
8678700	8679340	Yeah.
8679340	8682860	And you can view your opponent's connection status, you know, for people that are, you
8682860	8684780	know, trying to do like switching and all that stuff.
8684780	8686860	So, uh, yeah, that's pretty cool.
8686860	8691660	So, uh, the update is supposed to have more tweaks in addition as well, but, uh, we don't
8691660	8696060	know exactly what they all are yet, but it is supposed to be a pretty big update coming
8696620	8697260	very soon.
8698380	8704220	All right, let's get into some release dates around the world and we'll start with Loki

8980060	8983900	It's already a PA patrol game on stadia. Well, this is a grand Prix game. You know what
8984780	8988780	they said, Hey, you know what? Mario Kart, I think we can do it better. And then they
8988780	8993420	failed at it, but it's coming to stadia. And that's, they're like, we're the number one

9065260	9069420	I think this is the rerelease of the first game because it was digital before when you bought
9069420	9073100	Bayonetta two on the switch, you got a digital copy. So if you want a physical copy in advance
9073100	9079820	of three, this is your chance coming out of Japan this week. Uh, and that is so FIFA 23. Of course,

9151100	9155980	these last few stories here, and then I'm going to open up the green room. So vog network.com
9155980	9160220	slash discord. If you want to call in tonight, join the green room. Otherwise we have a few
9160220	9163340	more stories for you. I was going to say, we're going to rush through them. I don't want to rush
9163340	9168460	this first one though. So Loki, tell us a little more about this. Yeah. So, uh, this is pretty
9168460	9177500	cool. So Xbox has launched a new program called project amplify. It is to basically promote and
9177500	9188540	amplify black voices and, um, developers of color to inspire them to make games. Um, so apparently
9188540	9194380	there's, you know, lack of representation in the development community and they're just trying to
9194380	9203900	promote, you know, developers to put stuff out on, um, Xbox. So they have a video series, um,
9203900	9210780	under, uh, the project amplify name, uh, that's on the ID at Xbox YouTube channel. It's, um,
9210780	9218860	like 16 episodes that highlights different game designers and they even have, um, different,
9219500	9225180	it's not just developers. They also have like, you know, um, narrative directors, artists,
9225980	9233340	software engineers, that type of stuff as well. Um, and this is all in, you know, kind of, uh,
9233340	9242060	revolving around also a, uh, revolt summit, which is taking place from September 24th through 25th
9242060	9248380	in Atlanta, Georgia. So it's cool. It's nice to see some of those, you know,
9248380	9255020	actions and plans around, you know, um, trying to, you know, bring more diversity into gaming and
9255020	9259820	game development and so forth. It's nice to see that plan and see it in action. It speaks a lot
9259820	9267260	louder, I think than the typical, you know, social media text image, um, committing to do better.
9267260	9273340	They're also going to have a panel too at that revolt summit as well. Um, so that's going to
9273340	9281420	be there and then they've got, um, there's a page on their Xbox website, uh, xbox.com that talks
9281420	9288060	about, it's like, um, different resources as well. So, you know, they have, um, you know, getting
9288780	9296460	learning C sharp, um, getting started with unity, um, getting started with unreal engine
9296460	9303020	game design, um, development process, narrative tools, art tools, et cetera. So it's, you know,
9303980	9309180	all these different things to hopefully help promote, you know, more developers that come
9309180	9313740	to the Xbox platform or just become developers in general. All right.
9314380	9319420	Okay. Let's, uh, just we'll, we'll rapid fire these remaining stories. So dark Sakura.
9320860	9327900	Oh, um, there is some drama going on with take two interactive. Their help desk was hacked.
9328540	9335660	Um, and so they're, uh, the party that did so send a communication out to players with a malicious
9335660	9342060	link. Um, they put out a warning about it, not to open any emails or click on links from 2k games
9342540	9348700	support account. And they're encouraging people to reset their passwords stored in the browser,
9348700	9357420	um, enable multi-factor authentication, uh, run an antivirus and, uh, check their account settings
9357420	9364380	to see if forwarding rules have been added onto their email accounts. Um, they, uh, they have
9364380	9370220	taken their support function offline while they investigate and try to correct the issue. Um,
9371180	9379260	and, uh, this comes right after an extortion group, uh, lapis with a dollar sign, uh,
9380460	9385900	uh, compromised, uh, rockstar games. Um, you know, again with the grand theft auto issue.
9386460	9394460	So this seems that there's going a bunch. We'll see, but yeah, be careful for your 2k game stuff.
9395020	9399500	Be careful what you click on in general, always exercise good judgment. And if an email sounds
9399500	9405340	fishy, probably as it probably is. Yeah. And multi-factor authentication. I mean,
9405340	9412300	it's not perfect branding. It's really strong. So pay very close attention to branding
9413020	9419260	because they, or, and also the exact email addresses that things come from. Um,
9420140	9426540	also you can, if anything looks suspicious, you can show headers and see where they routed from.
9426540	9435420	All right. Let's move on Loki. All right. So, uh, I'm a big fan of video game donkey.
9435420	9441100	He does some hilarious videos online and makes different like review stuff for video games.
9441100	9449900	Well, now he is using his persona on YouTube and his following to help, uh, indie game,
9450860	9456220	uh, studios publish their games. So he's actually starting a publishing label called big mode.
9456700	9467020	And he's basically looking to partner with, um, you know, AAA quality indie games to try to
9467020	9473260	promote their game content and get their game out there. So we'll have to see what exactly
9473260	9481340	that turns into it's a lot easier to say than to do. I think this individual is going to find out.
9481340	9485740	And, um, I, I know we're trying to abbreviate for time, but the one thing I had wanted to say on
9485740	9494940	this is, um, quickly, you know, if this was Sony PlayStation leveraging Sony media to push the
9494940	9499260	Sony products, which they do do sometimes, let's be real. A lot of these companies do that sort
9499260	9503180	of thing. I think a lot of us will kind of look at that and go, well, that's shady because they're
9503180	9510700	just pushing their own stuff. It's interesting that this individual sees this as the solution
9511660	9517020	to put together a publishing arm, what they can promote their own stuff through.
9517820	9523580	I'm just saying it's a little bit, I think there's a little bit, I don't know. I don't know if this
9523580	9527660	is the smartest move to get into this, but I wish him luck. Um, but I think you're going to find
9527660	9533180	with a lot of these indie lower budget titles, a lot of it is, uh, what, you know, like the
9533180	9539580	trombone champ, what goes viral, what can be the it girl. What's the thing that, because you know
9539980	9546380	what, I'm still convinced to this day, YYR's super multitasking is so deserving of its moment in the
9546380	9553580	sun, but it just, it like anything else, it needs that moment to go viral, you know, and I can,
9553580	9557660	I can hype that game till I'm blue in the face, but until it gets right in front of the right
9557660	9562300	people, you know, it's, it's not any, there's, there's plenty of other good games I'm unaware
9562300	9566700	of that probably need that moment. Anyway, I could say more, but I'm trying to move fast. So
9566700	9571340	I will go right into the last story here, which is about the song list that has been released
9571340	9578060	for a theater, them final bar. Yes. The song list was revealed. And, uh, I already have seen plenty
9578060	9585020	of the punchlines in our discord about yes. Crazy chocobo from final fantasy 13, two is in there.
9585020	9588780	Of course. I bet. I mean, of course it was going to be in there. They weren't going to cut songs
9588780	9594540	like when they're doing like 400 songs, anything they've done a chart for, uh, in these games was
9594540	9599900	going to be in the game. That's free content. Uh, it would be very easy to skip that song and never
9599900	9605020	play it, which would be the right call. Cause it's not a great song. However, uh, when I was looking
9605020	9609340	at the list of like, okay, final fantasy 14 content, I wanted to see what they added from
9609340	9614460	fantasy 14 and they put some really sweet stuff from a shadowbringers in there. So, um, they did
9614460	9621340	add some stuff. Um, yeah, so, uh, there's a lot and, uh, the, the bonus stuff from other square
9621340	9626460	games, it looks like they have a pretty impressive lineup of songs from other square games as well.
9626460	9632140	They're bringing in things from, um, uh, live alive is going to be in the game, which I thought
9632140	9637420	was very interesting. They also are going to some of the, um, spinoff albums like the primals,
9637420	9643740	uh, has a song in it from their CD, the scions and sinners arrangement album for Fava SE 14.
9643740	9649020	But then you get into like the saga series, the world ends with you. We all knew near was going
9649020	9652860	to have some pad. Yes. They're doing way to the world. That's the only one I needed to see here
9652860	9658540	in there. Um, chrono, mana games, octopath traveler. I mean, this is really going to be
9658540	9665580	like a square collection. The only square series that seems to be missing is kingdom hearts,
9665580	9670060	but I'm going to assume that's understandable. Number one, you had the melody of mediocrity
9670060	9674940	game that already came out that tried to change the theater, them formula and failed miserably,
9674940	9679900	but you also have the Disney thing in there, which probably makes it a little more difficult.
9679900	9684940	Um, so we, we may not see those unless they are the question mark titles that are still
9684940	9691740	yet to be announced. But, uh, I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't hedge my bets on it. I would bet
9691740	9698780	the question marks are probably up coming square titles. I bet, um, for spoken is going to be one
9698780	9703820	of the games that has music that gets added into a theater of them. Although maybe that would be
9703820	9707340	a little weird. Oh no. Cause the game's gonna be on PlayStation as well. So you don't even have the
9707340	9713740	switch versus PlayStation issue there. So that's just, or five has he 16 at that point will be out.
9713740	9718860	So it would make sense that a DLC pack would have the 16 music. Well, they also have that,
9718860	9725820	uh, seven. What was that? Um, gosh, I don't remember the, the, uh, seven prequel thing.
9725820	9733260	Yeah. Um, crisis core. Yeah. Crisis. I don't know if they're adding new music to the
9733260	9738060	remake that they're doing fifth dream and chat says do simple and clean, then get the fuck out.
9738060	9742620	But then you have to pay Utada money to do that. And you know, they have every right to
9742620	9748540	money as well from that, you know, collaboration so forth. So the Japanese one, cause it's better.
9749100	9753740	Well, ideally we could select either one, but I'm not, I'm not, I don't think simple and clean was
9753740	9758140	even a melody of mediocrity probably because they didn't work out a deal with Utada. I don't think
9758140	9764300	any of their songs are in it. I could be wrong. You're going to put anyone in there. Do kiss me.
9764300	9770860	Goodbye. Cause, um, Angela Aki, I love her as Joe and her mat says, Rob is just throwing his
9770860	9775660	bank account at this game for the complete pack. True. I will be buying the complete pack. I'm just
9775660	9780060	still deciding if I want it on PlayStation or if I want it on switch, I think I'm going to end up
9780060	9786060	getting it on switch. The portable element to play it on a plane is pretty enticing, but yeah,
9786060	9791900	will I be dropping a hundred dollars on the Uber Edison? Yep. It's me. I'm the problem.
9792700	9797500	All right, let's get to the list. That's not a problem because they're giving you content.
9797500	9801580	Yeah, you're right. The content is there. There's a difference between a hundred dollar loop box
9801580	9805740	where you don't know what's in it and a hundred dollars worth of content that they've outlined.
9805740	9810300	It's basically a digital collector's edition is what that is. Honestly, there's like 400 songs
9810300	9813660	in Final Fantasy 14. If they were like, we're going to loop box the remainder of the Final
9813660	9822700	Fantasy 14 soundtrack, I'd be like, I'm part problem. All right, let's move on to the listener
9822700	9826460	round table. We're going to start with our mailbag because I don't see anybody in the green room,
9826460	9831340	but I will get to tweets here in a minute, but let's read this quickly. Yep. Participate
9831340	9837340	at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us emails. Hello peoples. So I'm at home after dinner
9837340	9841340	with my family and catching up on episodes of X-Play on G4, which I'm watching on my DVR because
9841340	9845260	I subscribe to cable. Currently I'm watching an episode where they're doing a retrospective of
9845260	9849500	the Xbox one versions of Madden. It's interesting to see the opinionists talk about a product that's
9849500	9853500	gone stale over the past few years, but not interesting enough for me to watch the episodes
9853500	9858940	of X-Play as they're released. I'm watching an episode from a month ago and advertisers on
9858940	9864540	television pay a higher value on people who watch their ads when their ads are current. What could
9864540	9870700	G4 do to get people to watch their cable content in a more current fashion? Esports. About the only
9870780	9875340	thing keeping cable television afloat right now aside from house flipper shows that are
9875340	9881340	on in the background as I'm getting my nails done is live sports. Why did Turner and ESPN pay 24
9881340	9888860	billion for their rights to air NBA games? Why did CBS, NBC, Fox, and ESPN pay 39.6 billion for
9888860	9893820	their rights to NFL games? Why are networks in Europe willing to pay 13.5 billion for Premier
9893820	9899180	League football? Because people who watch sports tend to watch it live as it's happening, whether
9899180	9902620	it's at home on the couch or at a bar with friends or in the background as you're making dinner,
9902620	9907180	people tend to watch sports live as it's happening. G4 could do what other cable networks
9907180	9911820	are doing by airing esports competitions live as they are happening. Yes, G4 does air esports
9911820	9916220	competitions, but these competitions are not live as they're happening. Live does mean as they're
9916220	9921660	happening for the record. Yes, these competitions are also available on Twitch, but G4 could air
9921660	9928700	these competitions live as well. All it would take is G4's parent company Comcast to be willing to
9928780	9933100	put forth a substantial investment in this platform and therein lies the problem. If you
9933100	9938940	watch things on a DVR on Comcast Cable like I do, eventually you'll see a screensaver come up. Often
9938940	9943980	these screensavers promote things that are available via Comcast. Currently one of the
9943980	9948620	Comcast DVR screens promote their customers getting access to Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
9948620	9954620	Live Beta. Now is there anything on this particular screensaver promoting G4? No, despite the fact that
9954620	9961180	it all would take is putting the G4 logo on the side of the screensaver. If Comcast is willing to
9961180	9964860	put a single logo on one of their screensaver slides, what makes you think Comcast is willing
9964860	9969900	to invest in anything having to do with G4? Take care of entertainment. Well, thank you for the
9969900	9974860	email, Redertainment, and you do make some very good points. I think especially when you hit on
9974860	9979820	the fact that one thing that compels people to watch television is live events. Sports is the
9979820	9985980	biggest one, of course, but even reality TV like American Idol, when that show was a little more
9985980	9990380	relevant, I think the reason why was because there was so much of that live element to it
9990380	9997660	that really made it must-see TV, or the news is live and so forth, and still it makes local TV
9997660	10003340	relevant and so forth. So I do think you hit on something there, but again, we had additional news
10003340	10009020	about G4 this week. Now, Frost is leaving, who's the only one that's given them a truly viral
10009020	10014380	moment. Kevin Pereira, I believe, is leaving now as well. So it's kind of like one of those,
10014380	10018780	you know, it's too early to eulogize G4, you know, maybe something comes through with the
10018780	10026700	cost-saving initiatives, but I just, I think when it comes to video game media, G4 is one of many
10026700	10032140	participants in that conversation at this point. And that's the way I can put it, like, without
10032140	10037820	making it sound like I'm dogging on G4, because I'm not, but it's just G4 has to compete with a
10037820	10043900	lot of other people in the room now. And that wasn't the case, you know, 10, 15 years ago,
10043900	10048300	when G4 was more of the traditional TV network, and that's all you had, because people didn't
10048300	10051580	have the internet fast enough to create their own television. So.
10053020	10057820	On top of that, with the eSports stuff, it's a good idea, but at the same time, I think that's
10057820	10063900	already being broadcast on like ESPN. So I'm assuming that there's some sort of rights exchange
10063900	10068940	that's going on there. They're not just doing it for the, out of the goodness of their heart. So
10068940	10075340	I'm wondering if they can't purchase the rights to that because it's already been purchased.
10075340	10079900	And not to mention, if they're going to cost save, they don't have the money to do it.
10081500	10087500	All right, I'm going into some tweets real quick. The vast majority of the tweets we were tagged in
10087500	10092620	last week, the vast majority had to do with Dark Sakura being on the Stadia Doshid show
10093180	10098140	last week, just because they were tagging us and they have fans that were retweeting and
10098140	10101420	hearting. And it seems like your appearance was really, really well received over there.
10102300	10106380	All I noticed was it was a long listen, so I haven't listened yet, but maybe that's something
10106380	10111260	for airline travel when I get around to it, because I did see the YouTube that was posted.
10111260	10117180	But yeah, thanks to Stadia Doshid for the multiple shout outs and sounds like you had
10117180	10121500	a really good time there and made some new fans over there at the Stadia Doshid show. Thanks.
10121580	10127260	Absolutely had a fantastic time. I really enjoyed it. I would do it again in a heartbeat.
10129180	10133900	I will say, I believe this tweet that came to us is from one of those people that came to us from
10133900	10139180	the Stadia Doshid show who tweeted us. It's on Twitter, Dustin Arand. And if you want to tweet
10139180	10144380	us, by the way, it's at OLR who said, hey, great show. I have some counters to some points. Number
10144380	10147420	one, we don't accept those here, actually. I'm going to move on. No, of course, every gamer has
10147420	10151260	a voice, so let's get to these. Number one, Ubisoft does have their own subscription on
10151260	10156060	console and the cloud. It's called Ubisoft Plus, and it's free to try until October 10th.
10157660	10163660	I forgot about that. I plumbed, but you know what? You have to install that. I shouldn't have forgot
10163660	10170540	because you have to install that fricking shell to get Assassin's Creed Odyssey on the PC. I don't
10170540	10173100	know if you know that, but with- I'm on a Mac.
10173100	10179900	Well, I know you do the cloud stuff, but I'm playing because of Game Pass and Game Pass PC.
10181100	10185340	It's not like the other games where it installs directly in Game Pass. You have to download the
10185340	10191180	Ubi thing and Game Pass basically talks to the Ubi thing and enables it on your account that way,
10191180	10195900	which is interesting. It used to be Uplay back in the day, but then yeah, like the
10195900	10202300	Twitter user saying, Dustin is saying, it's the Ubisoft Plus thing now is what it is. But I forgot
10202300	10207420	that it was also like a whole cloud subscription thing and you could get their whole library.
10207420	10214540	So yeah, good point. Good point. And then as another G4 comment, as far as G4 and cable
10214540	10220300	and leaks us to an article called Cable TV is the New Landline, which is kind of a point I was
10220300	10225980	trying to make last week, an article from the New York Times, due to our own timeframe tonight,
10225980	10230140	I'm not going to go through the article on air. I did read it off air when you first sent us the
10230140	10236380	tweet and it was really reemphasizing a lot of things I kind of thought I was saying last week
10236380	10245420	about yeah, cable TV is not going to be what it is now in another 20 years. And things change,
10245420	10252380	technology changes. That's okay. You don't see as many people rocking satellite dishes as you
10252380	10259100	used to, unless you live in a place that can't get service in any other manner. I realized-
10259660	10261420	Stay tuned is irrelevant.
10261420	10269020	If you're in Alaska, satellite is huge. And then Dustin says one more tweet that says,
10269020	10273660	whoever mentioned Crypt of the NecroDancer on the show, I got that on sale a month ago and I've been
10273660	10278620	addicted ever since. Got it for Switch too. Well, make sure you probably already know this if you're
10278620	10284060	a Switch user, but make sure you look out for Cadence of Hyrule as well. It's the same fricking
10284060	10288780	game from the same developers, but it's Zelda stuff. So even if you're not super into Zelda,
10288860	10292940	which I don't think many gamers would say that, but I'm sure there's some out there,
10293980	10300940	that was definitely worth a look would be Cadence of Hyrule if you are not already in that.
10302060	10307900	All right. Awesome. So I don't see anybody in the green room and that is a-okay because we're right
10307900	10311900	about nine o'clock anyway. I hope I wasn't discouraging people from calling in, but we'll
10311900	10319660	try again next week over at vognetwork.com slash discord. If nothing else, join the discord,
10319660	10324380	talk to us throughout the week, send us your comments, send us some other things you have
10324380	10328700	to say, cause I love to read them throughout the week. So vognetwork.com slash discord. And of
10328700	10335260	course the tweets are great too. Stadia fans and all gaming fans, twitter.com slash O-L-R for
10335260	10340460	whatever tweets you may have for us. And I hope we can join on some other podcasts as well out
10340460	10344780	there in the coming weeks. We love guesting on other shows, all of us. I'd love to have
10346300	10351660	them on. I think it would be awesome. Ever since we went virtual, we haven't really had a lot of
10351660	10355180	guests on the show. I think we have to figure out what the format for that looks like. So we're not
10355180	10360860	asking somebody to commit three whole hours to be here, but yeah, I'm all for bringing lots of it.
10360860	10365820	I think you and I know about Between Us, probably like at least 25 Twitch streamers we'd love to
10365820	10373100	bring on this show, if not more. So yeah. I would be down for it. I still kind of want to do
10373100	10379820	like my Dead by Daylight sort of themed one where interviews are conducted as a character.
10379820	10385020	Yeah. I think it would be funny. Bobby in chat says lies you've had Shane several times,
10385020	10388780	not for the whole show though. So yeah, we usually, and that's probably the way to do
10388780	10392220	it with a guest is we invite them in to talk about the kickoff topic. And usually when I've
10392220	10397180	had Shane on, or I think there was somebody else too in one episode, it's about the kickoff topic
10397180	10401980	and so forth. So we can always kind of shape the show that way, but we'll talk about that
10401980	10405260	another time. For now, we're going to wrap it up. Dark Soccer, I know you're about to head out
10406220	10409820	and do your thing. Do you want to give us a final thought tonight before you head out?
10410620	10411340	A Wesker.
10413660	10416860	Well said. All right. Bye, Jamie. Have a good stream.
10416860	10417980	Later taters.
10417980	10422540	All right. And of course, I'm going to say as always, thank you for downloading and listening
10422540	10426780	to Orange Lawns Radio, whether it was on the podcast feed or you were here live. I appreciate
10426780	10431740	you being a part of the show. You can always leave us a nice five-star review on iTunes or Spotify,
10431740	10436860	or wherever it is you found this podcast. Those reviews go an awful long way in those kind words.
10436860	10441260	We want to grow our family here at Orange Lawns Radio and Vogue Network. We can only do that.
10441260	10446060	They're bringing more people in here and spreading the word. So tell a friend or two about the show.
10446060	10449740	Thank you so much to those of you that do. I don't say that enough. I do see that there
10449740	10453100	are people that do that. I appreciate the shout outs. I appreciate the tweets.
10453100	10455740	All of that stuff is great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for those that do that.
10457740	10461660	That's it. Let's get final thoughts and get on out of here. Loki, your final thought tonight.
10463260	10468060	Almost done with this bill. I can't wait. Probably another day or so and I'll have it done.
10468060	10474700	And then a video this week for sure. It's been three weeks and I feel real bad about it. But
10475580	10481260	you know, considering everything that was going on and then the size of the bill. Yeah,
10481260	10488700	it's understandable. My final thought. I'm going to stream on my personal stream Monday and Friday.
10488700	10492860	Maybe. Well, I can't do Wednesday because work situation, but maybe Thursday night. I'm still
10492860	10499340	trying to figure out a good game to do Thursday night. I'm kind of on the fence between streaming
10499340	10504140	those Atari recharge games. I might get a couple more of them and stream those. Bone Champ. Or
10505260	10508940	well, yeah, there's always Trombone Champ. But I'm also thinking Splatoon three. I think I got
10508940	10511820	to get on board with that eventually. I'm kind of waiting to hear if they've patched some of
10511820	10516380	the communication issues, because that's the big thing that's been ticking me off about that. So
10516380	10520140	it's not so I'm playing that. I don't know if it's any good, but he likes it. Is he getting
10520140	10524940	disconnected? I think he's just been playing the single player. Oh, OK. Yeah, there is always that.
10524940	10531740	I could always just play that. But I still I don't really want to reward Nintendo for their crappy
10531740	10535580	online, but we'll see. We'll see. I otherwise have been hearing good things about the game.
10535580	10539340	A lot of tweets about this flat fest this weekend. So we'll see. We'll see.
10539340	10541900	Even less of an excuse now that we have to pay for it, you know?
10541900	10547100	Yeah, right. All right. But that is it. Thank you so much. Thanks for listening to Orange
10547100	10551260	Lounge Radio. Thank you so much for being here. We will see you next week. Have a wonderful week,
