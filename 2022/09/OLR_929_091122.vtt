Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:43.780 --> 00:46.060
where every gamer has a voice.

00:46.060 --> 00:53.780
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 929 of our

00:53.780 --> 00:58.400
show for tonight, September the 11th of 2022.

00:58.400 --> 01:03.520
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined each week here to talk about video games, gaming

01:03.520 --> 01:08.900
culture, the gamer lifestyle with my friends, although sadly not Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers

01:08.900 --> 01:13.980
tonight she has the night off, I'm just going to be real with everyone, it's been a week

01:13.980 --> 01:18.900
trademark patent pending and so it's kind of a miracle that we're here doing a show

01:18.900 --> 01:24.900
tonight but a nobody loves to miss two weeks of shows that's you know what's the secret

01:24.900 --> 01:29.180
of doing a podcast for over 20 years make sure you stay regular right although I'm sure

01:29.180 --> 01:32.140
everyone would have understood if we took another week off and I'm going to get into

01:32.140 --> 01:38.140
why in a little bit we kind of push forward with tonight however Dark Sakura she is still

01:38.140 --> 01:42.580
recovering from some under the weather stuff and it affects her voice so she's actually

01:42.580 --> 01:47.840
not even doing really her personal streams she just is resting her voice and not talking

01:47.840 --> 01:51.580
right now to make sure she fully recovers so obviously doing this show would be very

01:51.580 --> 01:56.540
difficult in line with that vision so she has the night off so she can rest however

01:56.540 --> 02:03.000
joining me tonight as he does usually do say hello to Loki hi Loki hello how are you doing

02:03.000 --> 02:09.520
Loki I'm doing okay I guess yeah it's it's been a week for me and it's been a week for

02:09.520 --> 02:14.880
you so my voice is a little off because I think many of you have already seen this on

02:14.880 --> 02:21.900
like Twitter and social media I got COVID so I'm recovering and this you might be going

02:21.900 --> 02:27.740
wait a minute didn't you already have COVID yeah I did about six or seven weeks ago I

02:27.740 --> 02:33.380
already had COVID the first time so I had COVID for the second time and this time was

02:33.380 --> 02:38.660
much worse it was very clearly a different variant because the symptoms were very very

02:38.660 --> 02:43.940
different so if my voice does sound a little bit like like sultry smoker voice not that

02:43.940 --> 02:48.160
I want to glamorize smoking here in the year 2022 but there was a time in my life when

02:48.160 --> 02:52.340
I you know would go see the Rocky Horror Picture Show and smoke clothes behind the theater

02:52.340 --> 02:57.540
I quit a long time ago thank you but my voice is getting back into that range right now

02:57.540 --> 03:03.180
so if my voice does sound off that's what's going on so it's both Dark Sakura and I dealing

03:03.180 --> 03:08.740
with illness issues but I I feel well enough voice wise to do the show and I'm also kind

03:08.740 --> 03:15.120
of like I kind of I need to do OLR like after this week I've I've literally gotten to do

03:15.120 --> 03:19.940
nothing I enjoy this entire week Dragon Con was great and I'll get into that in a minute

03:19.940 --> 03:24.760
but I've gotten to do nothing I enjoy this week I always come back from Dragon Con extremely

03:24.760 --> 03:32.480
motivated to make content and do stuff and this COVID put the brakes on all of that so

03:32.480 --> 03:36.880
that's kind of been a bummer so I'm really glad to be back here doing OLR with you and

03:36.880 --> 03:42.520
thank you for the kind words over at twitch.tv slash vog network because we do tape live

04:17.560 --> 04:22.120
says you sound a bit off but not bad thank you dark to see it says yeah I notice it but

04:22.120 --> 04:26.200
yeah it's fine yeah so I do I want people to know if my voice sounds different tonight

04:26.200 --> 04:30.600
it's not like something in the podcast or it's just the fact that I'm recovering from

04:30.600 --> 04:38.720
from COVID again um Loki you've also had quite a bit of a week I want to give you the space

04:38.720 --> 04:43.300
to talk we will talk about video games uh and I know video games probably for both of

04:43.300 --> 04:47.740
us have been a great and needed distraction this entire week um but I want to give you

04:47.740 --> 04:51.980
some space to talk about your week as well Loki if you want to tell us better let's talk

04:51.980 --> 05:05.420
about my week so um let's see so last Sunday um my mom passed away so she had like like

05:05.420 --> 05:11.560
when I picture like the worst case scenario as far as like how I look at my life as far

05:11.560 --> 05:18.960
as like uh work sucks you know then you retire and then like then um you know you have that

05:18.960 --> 05:24.200
time to like do whatever you want well so basically she retired last year and you know

05:24.200 --> 05:31.160
she was looking to enjoy her retirement uh come around New Year's I think it's like shortly

05:31.160 --> 05:39.760
after the first like shortly around New Year's time she got a minor stroke so obviously there

05:39.840 --> 05:46.960
is something going on um so it wasn't too impactful she like lost a tiny bit of her

05:46.960 --> 05:53.880
vision but for the most part was just normal um then they were trying to investigate like

05:53.880 --> 05:59.960
some heart valve issue that she had um that they thought might have been causing the leaking like

05:59.960 --> 06:05.440
causing clots because it was leaking or something like that um in March she had a full-blown stroke

06:05.520 --> 06:15.000
which caused her um to lose more vision to lose the ability to speak clearly I guess it's basically

06:15.000 --> 06:21.800
here speech center so the best you could do was like one or two words and a lot of times those

06:21.800 --> 06:27.240
words would be the wrong words coming out um she could understand just fine but she couldn't like

06:27.240 --> 06:34.240
really talk clearly and it was also like very very mumbly you know very quiet like strained almost to

06:34.240 --> 06:42.200
talk um so then they kept pushing back her heart surgery because she obviously had the strokes and

06:42.200 --> 06:47.200
they have her on blood thinners and like we're getting all that so in July she finally has her

06:47.200 --> 06:54.120
valve replacement surgery and everything seemed like okay we're gonna finally address the source

06:54.120 --> 07:01.600
of the clotting oh and also before that they had she had like fibroids that they thought may have

07:01.600 --> 07:06.240
been cancerous but they weren't able to kind of like tell if they were or not there it was

07:06.240 --> 07:11.480
inconclusive if it was or not um so that was another thing that she would have had to have

07:11.480 --> 07:16.240
a hysterectomy to address that as well as they were assuming that it was cancerous but they

07:16.240 --> 07:24.760
weren't sure so anyways valve replacement surgery she's in the ICU for a while and it doesn't seem

07:24.760 --> 07:32.000
to be she's having clotting issues now so she's losing blood flow to her hands and her feet and

07:32.000 --> 07:38.840
tissues starting to die so like her fingertips are starting to go black and wither away her

07:38.840 --> 07:43.800
toes are starting to do that as well so come to find out originally they thought it was an allergic

07:43.800 --> 07:50.600
reaction to heparin which is a blood thinner but after doing different tests and after like

07:50.600 --> 07:57.000
basically trying to treat everything they can they came up with the diagnosis that it's catastrophic

07:57.000 --> 08:06.520
APS syndrome or anti let me pronounce this here antiphospholipid syndrome which is basically a

08:06.520 --> 08:16.040
catastrophic means it's it's horrible it's very rare to have it that strong it's like one in

08:16.040 --> 08:21.720
a hundred thousand or something like that and it's basically the immune system mistakenly attacks

08:21.720 --> 08:29.200
the proteins in the blood causing clots everywhere so she was basically clotting her veins her

08:29.200 --> 08:36.520
arteries organs everything which is extremely painful for her you know extremities and all

08:36.520 --> 08:48.680
that stuff so fast forward now to gosh it was two weeks ago Monday so the beginning yeah the

08:48.680 --> 08:54.400
beginning of the week from Sunday when she passed so Monday we had a meeting with the doctors and

08:54.400 --> 08:59.120
the whole like nursing team and they basically said there's nothing we can do for her she's

08:59.120 --> 09:05.680
dying so the start off the week I had to tell her because they aren't gonna do it I had to tell her

09:05.680 --> 09:10.360
that she's dying so that was fun to have a conversation with somebody to let her down she

09:10.360 --> 09:16.400
knew she knew what was going on you know obviously she was worried the entire time she wanted to go

09:16.400 --> 09:22.080
home she didn't want to be you thought she was in the ICU for I think three to four weeks so which

09:22.080 --> 09:28.120
is coming out of surgery you're supposed to be there for a couple days and that's it so clearly

09:28.120 --> 09:35.400
knew what that something wasn't up and mean during that time it's possible like she was sleeping a

09:35.400 --> 09:41.840
lot it's possible that she could have had other strokes we don't know but anyways she finally got

09:41.840 --> 09:49.280
released into hospice care which is basically end-of-life care to us so we had her she was sent

09:49.280 --> 10:01.400
to her home to basically pass away to die so we brought her home on Thursday and then she was you

10:01.400 --> 10:07.760
know it look she was still with it like on Friday and stuff like that and you know able to

10:07.760 --> 10:12.680
communicate it seemed like you know she was comfortable and everything but it just it

10:12.680 --> 10:20.080
progressed pretty fast you know we weren't able to you know keep her as comfortable we kept having

10:20.080 --> 10:25.400
the up the morphine and stuff thankfully though because of them it's a horrible syndrome to die

10:25.400 --> 10:31.600
from incredibly painful I can only imagine how scared she was but she was really out of it with

10:31.600 --> 10:37.640
the Ativan and morphine that they were giving her or we were giving her so thankfully I don't think

10:37.640 --> 10:45.120
she was really lucid but yeah so she passed away Sunday morning ironically enough my in-laws were

10:45.120 --> 10:51.240
coming to visit and when I first got there Sunday morning I could tell like I could hear her

10:51.240 --> 10:56.080
breathing she had the they called the rattles it's basically you lose the ability to swallow

10:56.080 --> 11:05.240
and it's kind of like snoring I guess sort of it's horrible sounding but she was like very loud

11:05.240 --> 11:11.320
when I got there and then like I remember like as the morning went on I was like yeah she seems to

11:11.320 --> 11:16.000
be getting quieter now like I don't know maybe she's starting to pass or whatever and so I had

11:16.000 --> 11:20.600
checked on her and she was I mean at that point she wasn't waking like opening her eyes at all

11:20.600 --> 11:27.120
anymore for like the last 12 hours or whatever and then so by the time my in-laws came to visit

11:27.120 --> 11:35.520
when we went back to the room she had passed already so very sad you know it's it wasn't as

11:35.520 --> 11:44.120
hard like honestly to see her like pass away it's just knowing how much she suffered for the last

11:44.120 --> 11:53.600
like gosh months so it was kind of a relief yeah that but yeah it sucks there's there's a lot

11:53.600 --> 12:00.200
there's a lot of parallels from you know what I went through five years ago as well so I'm not

12:00.200 --> 12:04.160
saying that in a way to make it about me but I'm saying that in a way where it's like I I can really

12:04.160 --> 12:10.040
relate to like you know a lot of what I'm hearing and and so forth and just you know I encourage

12:10.040 --> 12:14.080
you to look at chat right now there's a lot of love from a lot of people in our chat room right

12:14.080 --> 12:20.480
now sending their regards and well-races and you're you're absolutely on you're absolutely

12:20.480 --> 12:25.960
right about a couple things one she already knew she was gonna pass away like you weren't right

12:25.960 --> 12:30.680
you weren't really breaking that news you were just probably giving her confidence in what she

12:30.680 --> 12:37.300
already knew and you're you're right she's no longer having to suffer or anything so all the

12:37.300 --> 12:41.960
decisions you all made were correct and it was tough like because we had to go visit her in the

12:41.960 --> 12:46.600
hospital like we divide our time between myself and my sister to go visit her each day in the

12:46.600 --> 12:51.960
hospital and it's just it's hard to see her like that it's just constantly like she's you know

12:51.960 --> 12:57.240
looking at her fingers who I mean at the very least they thought okay you know if they can get

12:57.240 --> 13:02.360
the clotting under control it may be that she loses her fingertips but she's able to you know

13:02.360 --> 13:10.080
live a normal life and and it honestly if that's all it was it I mean it sounds horrible because

13:10.080 --> 13:14.040
they're like even like I'm like do you have to amputate that oh no I'll just fall off like an

13:14.040 --> 13:21.600
umbilical cord I'm like that's horrifying but they like if that's all it was because it was

13:21.600 --> 13:26.320
under her non-dominant hand too that wouldn't be so bad I mean that would suck but it wouldn't be

13:26.320 --> 13:34.080
so bad but yeah it was just unfortunate it sucks because like you know I'm looking forward to

13:34.080 --> 13:40.520
retirement because I hate my job so it's like this is this is a potential outcome that sucks

13:40.520 --> 13:49.680
well it it emphasizes also the very important this is why we have to do things now you know

13:49.680 --> 13:56.240
we have to enjoy all the time that we have now because even getting to 65 and retirement is

13:56.240 --> 14:03.600
never guaranteed yeah yeah it was only 67 is what yeah she wasn't so yeah yeah it's hard to

14:03.640 --> 14:07.960
say I mean you never know you'd be like you can plan for an amazing retirement you still want to

14:07.960 --> 14:14.000
take full advantage of your 30s 40s 50s and so on don't be a workaholic and not take advantage

14:14.000 --> 14:19.800
of those fun things now of course yeah don't kill yourself over your job yeah uh but yeah it's it's

14:19.800 --> 14:27.000
it's sad but at the same time it's like it's I mean I was expecting this outcome right weeks

14:27.040 --> 14:34.760
ago so it wasn't wasn't unknown and like even like during like last week in this week it's just been

14:34.760 --> 14:41.800
like trying to just get back to normal as quickly as possible just not worry about not focus on it

14:41.800 --> 14:47.640
too much you know it's so it's it's been for the most part pretty okay well I haven't been too

14:47.640 --> 14:53.800
upset about it but yeah it's hard to talk about every now and then but I mean at least she's not

14:53.840 --> 14:59.960
suffering anymore so there's that well well thank you for sharing Loki I know I know it's a

14:59.960 --> 15:04.120
difficult story to share but I think there's a lot you know I definitely identify with a lot of what

15:04.120 --> 15:09.400
you're sharing and I think there's a lot of people in chat that this is hitting home for I think a

15:09.400 --> 15:16.000
lot of us too many of us in the past few years have joined the lost parent or parents club and

15:16.000 --> 15:23.200
there's a lot a lot a lot of hugs going around and chat and the family for you so yeah now we're

15:23.240 --> 15:30.800
so worried about our grand my grandfather because he's 96 mm-hmm oh it's like yeah that's a matter

15:30.800 --> 15:36.240
of time like cuz yeah she had lost her mom literally last year like almost a year you

15:36.240 --> 15:42.760
know ago so yeah that was hard for her too and it's gotta be I can only imagine when he's going

15:42.760 --> 15:48.920
through to losing his wife and then losing his daughter like that yeah I can't imagine well you

15:48.920 --> 15:54.520
know in in big world news this week of course we know the Queen passed away and she was 96 you

15:54.520 --> 16:01.480
know and there's a lot of kind of III obviously there her being a big political figure there's a

16:01.480 --> 16:05.400
lot of takes all over this it which is interesting because she actually has nothing to do with

16:05.400 --> 16:10.280
politics as I understand it she's more of a figurehead but there's way too many opinions

16:10.280 --> 16:17.560
on a British monarch in America which is strange to me but I I'm gonna digress it's one of those

16:17.560 --> 16:24.960
things where I think a lot of people kind of look at that and go well I mean she's she's 96

16:24.960 --> 16:30.440
let her go quietly and without all this pomp and circumstance and the big deal that people are

16:30.440 --> 16:34.920
making it out to be but I get that she's a different you know type of figure 96 is still

16:34.920 --> 16:40.720
an incredible run you know and people are making all of these comparisons to oh she you know she

16:40.720 --> 16:44.620
was around for this and this and this that happened at the toy she's she's as old as sliced

16:44.620 --> 16:48.060
bread and all the same stuff they were saying about Betty White over here who was basically

16:48.060 --> 16:55.460
the Queen of America so you know it's um you know 96 is an incredible run but my grandma made it to

16:55.460 --> 17:03.300
99 so you know there might still be a few a few years to go and so many many get past 100 even

17:03.300 --> 17:13.380
so yeah yep um so I guess speaking of enjoying things in the moment and doing things while you

17:13.500 --> 17:19.940
can let's talk about my week two so I went to Dragon Con and that's why I missed last show I've

17:19.940 --> 17:26.540
been going to Dragon Con for the past God since 20 2013 was my first Dragon Con so this would have

17:26.540 --> 17:31.900
been basically my ninth because technically 2020 I don't count that one yes I know there was a

17:31.900 --> 17:36.620
virtual year and many people still count that for their streak I don't this was the ninth year for

17:36.860 --> 17:47.020
me so I would say nine Dragon Cons and one virtual Dragon Con so I went and I had a great honestly

17:47.020 --> 17:52.580
I had a really good time this year the panels I got to host I had some really good ones and some

17:52.580 --> 17:58.580
really good experiences Loki I got to do that Red Dead Redemption actors panel which is important

17:58.580 --> 18:02.980
because they're not voice actors and everything in the promo said they were voice actors they

18:02.980 --> 18:07.100
were voice and performance so they're really performance actors and we actually talked a

18:07.100 --> 18:11.860
little bit about at the panel about kind of the difference and that's not it was never a discussion

18:11.860 --> 18:16.540
about minimizing the importance of voice actors just pointing out that they're different art

18:16.540 --> 18:22.100
forms right just like you can you can paint with watercolor you can paint with oil right it's it's

18:22.100 --> 18:27.740
just different ways of making art so we talked a lot about the performance capture element of it

18:27.740 --> 18:32.500
and kind of what made that difference over so they were they were a good group I was really happy and

18:32.540 --> 18:38.340
honored to do that panel it was a Monday morning panel so it was not super well attended for a

18:38.340 --> 18:42.340
ballroom panel but it still had a really good crowd there was somebody that came all the way

18:42.340 --> 18:47.580
from China that asked a question and I was like wow that's pretty impressive so yeah it was um

18:47.580 --> 18:54.300
it was a good panel I got to do on the video game track some discussions on diversity in games and

18:54.300 --> 18:59.100
microtransactions in games sadly those panels weren't recorded so I don't think you'll see

18:59.100 --> 19:03.180
them anywhere but they were they were a lot of fun to participate in and some really really good

19:03.180 --> 19:09.260
points and things brought up I got to do a couple panels on the digital media track I got to do one

19:09.260 --> 19:13.700
about streaming when you're over 40 years old and what was interesting about that that was an

19:13.700 --> 19:20.780
interesting panel because we had some very very big name podcasters on that panel the macarons a

19:20.780 --> 19:25.740
couple of the people from the family and they do my brother my brother and me I think is the name

19:25.740 --> 19:29.260
of their big one and they have another big one that's D&D I think it's the whole family playing

19:29.260 --> 19:37.100
D&D together some of that I I don't listen to a lot of stuff because I don't want to be influenced

19:37.100 --> 19:41.620
the only shows I really listen to anymore are shows by drag queens and I can say the macarons

19:41.620 --> 19:46.460
are not drag queens so they're just not in my wheelhouse for things I listen to because you

19:46.460 --> 19:51.580
know there's a there's too many and B I don't want to be accidentally influenced or steal from

19:51.940 --> 20:00.060
another show but I I know these folks have a huge following that room was completely full and they

20:00.060 --> 20:05.580
had people outside in the hall watching the streaming together while it was streaming out

20:05.580 --> 20:11.100
of the room because the room could only hold like maybe 80 people so it was very interesting to do a

20:11.100 --> 20:18.180
panel for other people's fans but I thought it was a good discussion and I thought Bobby did a really

20:18.180 --> 20:23.780
good job moderating it and I thought and I will say the macarons were you could very easily be a

20:23.780 --> 20:28.740
diva in a situation like that and they absolutely weren't they shared the space equally with the

20:28.740 --> 20:32.820
rest of us that were on the panel and I just I really appreciate that and that says speaks to a

20:32.820 --> 20:37.820
very high level of professionalism from them one of them used to be with joystick the blog years

20:37.820 --> 20:44.220
ago so they know gaming and I think they they know Bobby from different circles and maybe me I don't

20:44.220 --> 20:50.980
know but yeah yeah Bobby says it was technically vogs panel Bobby Bobby Bobby yeah we were the

20:50.980 --> 20:56.260
ones who submitted it but nobody was there to see us well maybe I got actually people did try to

20:56.260 --> 21:01.700
come to see us because I did hear from several people that just didn't realize they would have

21:01.700 --> 21:10.100
to get to that panel an hour beforehand to see us so not to say nobody was gonna but just really

21:10.100 --> 21:16.060
underestimated the star power I guess that was on that panel so yeah technically it was submitted

21:16.060 --> 21:21.140
by us but it was fun I it was a good panel it was recorded so you will be able to see that on

21:21.140 --> 21:28.620
YouTube in a couple weeks when they put that online it's on their twitch channel as well I did

21:28.620 --> 21:36.980
another panel which was about I don't remember in the moment what was it oh it was the it was the

21:36.980 --> 21:43.860
video to it was the audio to video one that I that vog has done in years past but this year

21:43.860 --> 21:47.660
somebody else did it and Bobby and I were just kind of experts on that panel or whatever you

21:47.660 --> 21:51.660
want to call it that was a good panel to sadly I oh no that one was recorded so I'll be on YouTube

21:51.660 --> 21:56.300
as well sorry sometimes it's hard to keep track what isn't what isn't recorded and then I got to

21:56.300 --> 22:00.900
do a panel on the horror track I know that one was not recorded in any way there's only a few pictures

22:00.900 --> 22:05.380
out there of that but that was one on horror no respect and that was a lot of fun and I was really

22:05.380 --> 22:09.660
jazzed to get to do a panel on the horror track this year with more of the hosting stuff that I

22:09.660 --> 22:14.660
do on the side growing and so forth so that was all great so yeah I met a lot of great people

22:14.660 --> 22:22.500
professionally an incredible dragon con professionally an incredible dragon con and I

22:22.500 --> 22:28.220
really see I I'm I don't want to say too much because I don't want to jinx anything but it

22:28.220 --> 22:33.100
looks like 2023 may be an even bigger and better year and that is really really exciting and I'm

22:33.100 --> 22:39.740
gonna cross my fingers and toes for all that stuff but then you know I was staying with Bobby

22:39.740 --> 22:45.700
Black Wolf at Black Wolf Manor and Mrs. Black Wolf I was staying there Monday night I used to fly home

22:45.700 --> 22:50.700
on Monday night Labor Day but then we kind of made it a tradition I think the first year was maybe

22:50.700 --> 22:57.740
2018 I think that I actually went and I stayed at Bobby's place and it's just it's a nice way to

22:57.900 --> 23:03.420
decompress I got to see their house I get to you know he has that very nice theater sometimes we'll

23:03.420 --> 23:07.980
watch a movie or I'll play a game or you know I think we were watching a little bit of twitch

23:07.980 --> 23:11.820
this year because I think Alan was broadcasting a little bit so we watched him on the the big

23:11.820 --> 23:17.500
screen and you know he has his arcade and I'll talk a little bit about that and all that stuff

23:17.500 --> 23:23.340
so it just you know it's just so it's a nice way to like decompress after the con and then get on

23:23.340 --> 23:29.260
the flight on Tuesday which is the way to do it and because the airport's a lot less fucky on

23:29.260 --> 23:33.580
Tuesday too that's the other important thing and the flights are a little bit cheaper so all that

23:33.580 --> 23:40.300
stuff is very cool Tuesday morning I wake up and I have a pretty bad sore throat and I'm like uh-oh

23:41.180 --> 23:48.780
uh-oh but I'm thinking well this can't be COVID because I just had COVID seven weeks ago like I

23:48.780 --> 23:54.060
should have antibodies for at least two months I'm I'm good and this is probably you know what

23:54.060 --> 23:59.580
I've been taken in the air it's different here it's probably a little bit of concrete because

23:59.580 --> 24:04.780
I was around a bunch of people even though I was masked when I wasn't on a panel I wore my mask

24:04.780 --> 24:09.820
more than most people did and so forth I'm like it's just it's whatever it's just a little thing

24:09.820 --> 24:16.380
I caught picked up whatever and I guess I probably could have taken a test but at the same time what

24:16.380 --> 24:21.020
would that have done I was not going to impose on Bobby Blackwolf and Mrs Blackwolf to stay at

24:21.020 --> 24:27.660
their house for an additional 10 days and I was not you know really prepared for that sort of

24:27.660 --> 24:32.700
thing um and I didn't have any reason to really think it was COVID so I and I had to get to the

24:32.700 --> 24:39.980
airport because my flight was going to be leaving so I went to the airport and I flew home and as

24:39.980 --> 24:47.420
the day went on my day was getting a lot worse and I started to feel sicker and sicker and sicker

24:47.420 --> 24:52.140
and when I got home I immediately took I'm sorry for the um noise that went through in the

24:52.140 --> 24:56.460
background there I thought I had my alerts turned off uh sorry about that that is not you it is me

24:57.020 --> 25:03.740
um I was getting sicker sicker so I took a test and I got home and bam it's COVID and it's it's

25:03.740 --> 25:10.220
like the last time I had it I had just like a breath of fate a hint of a line but it was a line

25:10.220 --> 25:19.100
this time solid red you're fucked line just shows up on the test so I was like great I just flew

25:19.100 --> 25:26.460
home and exposed how many people to COVID but here's the thing can I sit around and feel guilty

25:26.460 --> 25:32.620
all day about that no I wore my mask very well the entire way home because I knew if nothing else I

25:32.620 --> 25:37.260
probably had con crud and so forth so I'm like you know what I'm gonna wear my mask diligently

25:37.260 --> 25:46.780
I maybe took it off twice for five seconds to take us a down water and shove a handful of

25:46.780 --> 25:53.660
pretzels in my mouth and that was it now did the people around me wear masks on the flight no

25:54.460 --> 26:04.060
nobody nobody there comes a point where I can't be responsible for other people

26:04.060 --> 26:09.420
that know the risk and so forth I did everything I could whether I had COVID or not

26:11.260 --> 26:19.020
um speaking of precautions and all of that I I'm not I'm definitely not

26:19.020 --> 26:26.060
mad at dragon con or any of that because that would be messed up I'm a big boy and I know

26:26.060 --> 26:30.060
that I was going to a convention that was going to be attended by many many people and that there

26:30.060 --> 26:37.980
would be a risk of COVID I thought falsely that my recent COVID would have given me extra protection

26:37.980 --> 26:43.180
but even going into it I knew well weird things happen people can still get it and very clearly

26:43.180 --> 26:51.500
I got some other type of variant so I'm a I'm a big boy and I own the fact that I knew the risk

26:51.500 --> 26:58.380
I went into this situation I'm not mad at anyone for the fact that I have COVID but but me however

26:59.020 --> 27:06.620
I was disappointed that the masking policy and adherence was nothing like it was in 2021

27:06.620 --> 27:12.460
in 2021 dragon con man everybody wore their masks and it was you know you people kept it on the

27:12.460 --> 27:18.540
whole time the masking was very good everyone did their thing this year it all fell apart and

27:18.540 --> 27:24.540
I would say in the hallways and walking around the convention maybe somewhere between 20 and 25 of

27:24.540 --> 27:30.220
the people were wearing masks and in the panel rooms maybe a little more because uh people would

27:30.860 --> 27:35.020
some of the door people going into some of the tracks and events were reminding people to put

27:35.020 --> 27:38.940
their mask on and maybe something a little bit more about the enclosed spaces I don't know I

27:38.940 --> 27:45.100
could theorize the whole day but the masking was not what it was in 2021 however my understanding

27:45.100 --> 27:54.140
is dragon con put out their masking policy only to be followed up by the cdc a week later who the

27:54.140 --> 27:59.820
cdc now comes in and says masking is optional so everybody comes to dragon con and wants to start

27:59.820 --> 28:04.540
pitching a fit and they start pointing at the cdc thing and go but the cdc says masking is optional

28:05.420 --> 28:12.060
volunteers of dragon con get sick of this fight after having to do it so many times

28:12.620 --> 28:20.780
I don't blame the volunteers for dragon con for giving up at some point the people that are temps

28:20.780 --> 28:27.660
working at the hotel also decide to stop giving up this fight because the hotels basically decide

28:27.660 --> 28:32.700
why should we be the bad guy why should the Hyatt the Hilton the Marriott why should we be the bad

28:32.940 --> 28:38.300
guy when dragon con can be the bad guy it's their policy so they give up enforcing it at some point

28:39.260 --> 28:45.500
it all fell apart because literally everybody gave up and I still believe something I said

28:45.500 --> 28:52.780
from the very beginning precautions work they worked in 2021 they worked at games done quick

28:52.780 --> 28:58.460
and those stories you hear from Bobby Blackwolf they didn't work here because there were no

28:58.460 --> 29:07.900
precautions taken and that is the fault of the dragon con attendees so shame on y'all

29:08.700 --> 29:17.420
you messed up but the reality is is this dragon con is this something unique to dragon con is

29:17.420 --> 29:25.100
this dragon con's fault is dragon con a super spreader event no and if you're one of those

29:25.100 --> 29:29.260
people on twitter or you're on social media that's sitting there going well people that

29:29.260 --> 29:34.300
went to dragon con they should they should know better they they were going to a super spreader

29:34.300 --> 29:37.980
event they're gonna go home and they're gonna get their family sick and they should feel bad

29:37.980 --> 29:42.380
these people going to dragon con you're stupid if you're going to dragon con I have two words for

29:42.380 --> 29:52.620
you fuck off and I'm gonna tell you something that's very ugly but you need to hear it you're

29:52.620 --> 29:59.660
on twitter talking to random people because you don't have friends in real life that you can talk

29:59.660 --> 30:06.460
to because you've pushed them all away with your shitty fuck attitude I'm telling you that because

30:06.460 --> 30:12.780
I care and that type of behavior on social media where you're literally taking pleasure in people

30:12.780 --> 30:25.260
getting sick needs to stop shut the fuck up now some people are going to feel very attacked by

30:25.260 --> 30:31.020
what I just said and I want to be very clear on something I am very I am only speaking to those

30:31.020 --> 30:37.740
people that go on to twitter and start to yell all of this stuff at people because they're taking a

30:37.820 --> 30:43.420
risk and they're taking a choice and they know and going into these situations hosting and all

30:43.420 --> 30:47.420
of this stuff that I do and leading panels and moderating and all this stuff this is my job

30:48.700 --> 30:54.300
it's not my day job but it's my night job and sometimes I don't like to talk about it but

30:54.300 --> 30:58.940
sometimes it's a paid job stop attacking me for doing things I need to do for my job

31:00.060 --> 31:05.820
I knew the risks I weighed the risks and I went into the situation now back to my earlier point

31:06.780 --> 31:10.140
or actually no I want to make sure I clarify this too because otherwise people are gonna

31:10.140 --> 31:13.020
get their panties and wad because they're gonna take what I said out of context

31:14.060 --> 31:19.820
if you are choosing to sit home because you don't feel safe at dragon con or any of this other stuff

31:20.700 --> 31:28.460
I support you that's your right go do it do what you need to do you know I I understand

31:28.460 --> 31:32.140
this is why we still have a lot of virtual things that are available this is why

31:32.540 --> 31:36.540
zoom is so much more a part of our culture now than it was a few years ago and so forth

31:36.540 --> 31:42.300
you have the absolute right to make that choice and do what you need to do for yourself I support

31:42.300 --> 31:49.820
that so please if you're in that crowd do not mistake what I just said which is again people

31:49.820 --> 31:56.300
attacking others for doing what they need to do that's not the same thing I want to make sure

31:56.300 --> 32:01.820
that is very very clear I respect anyone who didn't go to dragon con because they just felt

32:02.620 --> 32:04.060
a risk they wanted to take that's fine

32:08.220 --> 32:12.620
the reason why I say is it dragon con's fault is dragon con a super spreader event and all

32:12.620 --> 32:20.060
this stuff and I say no is because let's be real if I hadn't gotten this at dragon con

32:20.060 --> 32:25.420
because I didn't the first time I would have got it somewhere else like I did the first time

32:26.060 --> 32:30.860
I would have got it at a restaurant I would have got it at work I would have got it at Costco

32:30.860 --> 32:36.220
I would have got it at the grocery store I would have got it at the movies I would have got it

32:36.220 --> 32:43.740
walking going on walks at the gym I would have got it into at one of hundreds of other places

32:44.700 --> 32:54.860
because society has decided we're done with precautions and precautions work but without

32:54.860 --> 33:02.620
precautions nothing works anymore that is society's fault not dragon cons dragon

33:02.620 --> 33:11.100
con's just one part of society so I I so do I regret going to dragon con absolutely not

33:12.060 --> 33:19.340
I'm disappointed and frustrated that a the the masking and all that stuff because again you can

33:19.340 --> 33:23.980
say you can believe I can still say all of this that people should be able to take risk and go

33:23.980 --> 33:28.460
into these situations do what they need to do for their jobs their careers their mental health

33:28.460 --> 33:34.300
let people make that way decision and whatever they need to do I can say all that that is not

33:34.300 --> 33:39.980
an anti-masking stance because I can say that and I can also say but we should still take precautions

33:39.980 --> 33:44.140
like getting vaccinated wear your mask and do everything you need to do both of those things

33:44.140 --> 33:52.300
in my head are true so that's that's what it is and unfortunately though the the cloth over people's

33:52.300 --> 33:57.660
face has proven to be too much after two years and uh it is what it is it is what it is that's

33:57.660 --> 34:04.060
that's society's problem to figure out why we we can't bring ourselves to do that after a few years

34:04.860 --> 34:10.700
so uh getting some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network s2100 matt says people

34:10.700 --> 34:14.700
need to understand that many folks are taking risks into their hands it's their choice and they

34:14.700 --> 34:19.420
have their reasons mental health is a big reason many folks want to enjoy life the best way they

34:19.420 --> 34:27.660
can in this situation yeah exactly exactly and you know what I know a lot of people that saw

34:27.660 --> 34:33.180
lady gaga either this weekend within the week or last week you know how many people were at those

34:33.180 --> 34:40.700
concerts more than were at dragon con now granted it was outdoors but you see how tight all those

34:40.700 --> 34:49.660
people are sitting together it's a it's a risk and what and the reason why I said what I said

34:49.660 --> 34:54.940
and I was really nasty to people that need to hear something nasty because their behavior it's

34:54.940 --> 35:00.220
just a reflection of their behavior right now because there are so many of those people that

35:00.220 --> 35:06.460
are attacking people on twitter making certain decisions and so all this stuff there are so many

35:06.460 --> 35:13.260
people that say that stuff and then turn around and justify but I'm gonna I need to do this one

35:13.260 --> 35:24.940
thing that's the behavior that pisses me off is that people will blame dragon con attendees

35:24.940 --> 35:30.780
but then talk about their twitch con plans or their anime con plans or their packs plans or

35:30.780 --> 35:37.340
whatever it is or their concert they're gonna go to or I can't miss this particular thing or

35:37.340 --> 35:43.740
I've got this big family birthday party coming up or whatever it is like the hypocrisy smells it's

35:43.740 --> 35:51.180
so bad anyway DJ Ramez says people also forget one thing we are still in a pandemic yes true

35:52.380 --> 35:58.940
she-hulk 10 says it's scary especially long COVID absolutely and it sucks and I hope some of these

35:58.940 --> 36:06.380
symptoms I'm not going to have for a long time but again this was something that is because of

36:06.380 --> 36:14.460
the way society is right now in every place I was probably going to get it eventually well I did I

36:14.460 --> 36:20.300
did and I did I did get it one time already the only thing that really sucks is the fact that I

36:20.300 --> 36:25.500
know now that Alan got it too and at least you don't have kids because that's a whole other

36:26.140 --> 36:32.620
entry vector oh god don't you want to talk about another thing but anyway great point

36:34.140 --> 36:38.780
excuse me I will try to mute myself and not cough into the mic but I'm sure you all understand it

36:38.780 --> 36:47.100
may happen tonight I got Alan sick we tried our best to distance at home stay apart and so forth

36:47.900 --> 36:54.060
and of course I feel bad of course I don't I don't like that this has happened but Alan's

36:54.860 --> 37:00.380
you know in in his typical graceful wonderful way has said you know what it's been 30 months

37:00.380 --> 37:05.100
this is going to happen eventually and he has a very similar outlook I do if it didn't happen now

37:05.100 --> 37:11.500
it was going to happen like you got it before and I didn't or you know when it was restaurant or the

37:11.500 --> 37:16.860
gym or something else like this has got it was going to happen eventually so uh she-hulk 10

37:16.860 --> 37:23.340
in chat says hopefully it will weaken like the flu and die out soon that's it it does seem to be

37:24.060 --> 37:31.100
the way it's going I am not a scientist I can say what I had this last week sucked

37:31.100 --> 37:38.460
it was bad it was worse than a cold it was worse than a sinus infection but it wasn't as bad as

37:38.460 --> 37:45.420
swine flu I will say that so you might remember that was the thing that we here at OLRL got to

37:45.420 --> 37:49.340
deal with about 10 years ago I know if longer than that probably 12 years it wasn't as bad

37:49.340 --> 37:59.500
as swine flu in my opinion but it was up there all right um anyway I know I've said a lot and

37:59.500 --> 38:04.540
like none of it has been about games but I think it was important to say and um you know if I if

38:04.540 --> 38:09.580
I made you angry with something I said I just I just want you to stop and think about some of the

38:09.580 --> 38:13.100
things that you say and you put out on social media and so forth and put yourself in other

38:13.100 --> 38:17.900
people's shoes and again you have the right to make your own decisions on what is best for you

38:17.900 --> 38:26.220
that is 100 understandable it is not okay for you to attack other people blame other people

38:26.220 --> 38:32.300
or make people feel guilty because we're doing the things we need to do to keep our lives in

38:32.300 --> 38:41.820
wellness and running and in good state getting covid is not a moral failing repeated after me

38:41.820 --> 38:45.340
getting covid is not a moral failing

38:47.580 --> 38:56.540
society our leaders had a chance to minimize and reduce this two years ago in 2012 really in 2019

38:56.540 --> 39:03.900
and gone into 2020 we as a society and the leaders that lead us failed to do that we are now all

39:03.900 --> 39:14.380
paying the price so if you want to blame something blame that uh looking at chat over at twitch.tv

39:14.380 --> 39:18.460
slash vog network uh bobby blackwell says I respect everyone's risk tolerance and will no

39:18.460 --> 39:23.740
longer try to pressure even if it's mock pressure people to come to conventions with vog yeah let

39:23.740 --> 39:30.460
people know their options it's what it is uh yeah uh mike defton chat says I'm angry that people

39:30.460 --> 39:34.780
don't actually listen yeah and uh dg ramas says I've been saying similar things for the last two

39:34.780 --> 39:41.500
years on my podcast well if you think about it rama it's because we're both right all right I

39:41.500 --> 39:45.900
had to sneak something out there all right let's actually get into some gaming news now that we're

39:45.900 --> 39:51.420
what 45 minutes into the show uh hi dark soccer I see dark soccer joined the chat room so uh maybe

39:51.420 --> 39:58.140
giving us some thoughts there uh virtually tonight so all right let's get into um excuse me some

39:58.140 --> 40:03.580
actual gaming news uh loki you want to start us I have a lot of opinions on this too can't wait

40:03.580 --> 40:09.980
you want to start us off with this yeah we can talk about this so um there was the whole d23

40:09.980 --> 40:16.620
convention thing this week so there are lots of different announcements by disney regarding marvel

40:16.620 --> 40:24.060
star wars lucas arts uh disney properties and different things with that so one of the

40:24.060 --> 40:31.340
announcements was a brand new niantic game called marvel world of heroes that is supposed

40:31.340 --> 40:38.620
to be coming out in 2023 they had a trailer for it and it looks generic af I don't even know what

40:38.620 --> 40:42.940
the hell this is supposed to be but apparently you're supposed to be able to thwart crime take

40:42.940 --> 40:50.940
on missions do nonsense I don't know and you team up with your friends as well as superheroes not

40:50.940 --> 40:56.380
a single frame of game shown of course but this is as is tradition as is tradition for many of

40:56.380 --> 41:00.140
these niantic announcements remember the very first pokemon go announcement did not have a

41:00.140 --> 41:05.500
frame of gameplay in it I believe whenever it was they announced wizards unite although that was not

41:05.500 --> 41:10.700
a niantic game that was um portkey games used in partnership with niantic using their stuff

41:10.700 --> 41:15.180
um that I don't believe we saw a frame of footage in the launch trailer either so this is this is

41:15.180 --> 41:20.620
par for the course so we know it's something to do with marvel superheroes and apparently in an

41:20.620 --> 41:27.180
interview with one of the developers kind of gets into it's creating your own superhero which is I

41:27.180 --> 41:31.180
guess somewhat of a first in these marvel games I didn't realize there were like no other marvel

41:31.180 --> 41:34.860
games that you where you couldn't create your own hero um but I guess it also does kind of make

41:34.860 --> 41:40.060
sense and it sounds like they're aiming for a very robust character creator that reflects you know

41:40.060 --> 41:46.860
all the the spectrum of our society and all this stuff right now um so um I mean lego marvel

41:46.860 --> 41:52.620
superheroes can create your own characters as well but yeah yeah okay well yeah so yeah I don't

41:52.620 --> 41:57.500
but I I they were so I'm only saying that because it was in the interview or whatever they were

41:57.500 --> 42:02.300
saying like oh well we're like the first so I don't I don't know what it is that they're they're

42:02.300 --> 42:07.260
first thing but yeah there it is so and dark soccer is saying midnight suns and there was

42:07.260 --> 42:12.380
another marvel phone game as well so some somebody over there is full of it or there's well there

42:12.380 --> 42:17.660
there's one element of it that's new well midnight suns was it's going to be a brand new game but

42:17.660 --> 42:24.300
like um there's yeah they have another like game coming out with um captain america and black

42:24.300 --> 42:29.420
panther as well I'm not really sure that's all about but uh yeah this this I saw it I was like

42:29.420 --> 42:37.500
cool except also like I don't know it's like doesn't there's so many niantic games that are

42:37.500 --> 42:42.780
being announced and it's like will it really come out yeah we're seeing a lot of things we're not

42:42.780 --> 42:48.300
seeing a lot of receipts for the announcements I think it's starting to to bug some people and I

42:48.300 --> 42:54.460
get it how many games have they worked on that they just went eh well katan got cancelled we

42:54.460 --> 42:58.060
know that one right it was being tested in australia new zealand and a couple other countries

42:58.060 --> 43:04.300
as well and they they yanked it um so there's that oh questbusters clarifying in midnight sun

43:04.300 --> 43:10.780
you can customize the hero but the hero is a new character created by marvel for the game

43:10.780 --> 43:14.860
so that's the element because I believe in this one the hero is supposed to represent

43:14.860 --> 43:19.980
you so you are this so I think that's what they're getting at but we're really getting into

43:20.940 --> 43:25.020
weeds whatever like it doesn't matter as long as the game plays it doesn't it doesn't matter

43:25.020 --> 43:30.860
it's the gameplay right it doesn't matter about the character so um although it would be nice if

43:30.860 --> 43:35.020
all these this wide spectrum of society is something that is reflected in the game that's

43:35.020 --> 43:41.340
great let me just put it this way now I take it's very easy you'll never recapture pokemon go

43:41.340 --> 43:47.180
ever again you can try but it's never gonna happen again that lightning doesn't strike twice even

43:47.180 --> 43:52.700
though you have thor but it's just it's never gonna happen I'm sorry you can throw whatever

43:52.700 --> 43:58.220
property you want at this it's just not gonna happen um katan ever didn't happen transformers

43:58.220 --> 44:02.700
but I believe that was also a third party making that in partnership with niantic that got cancelled

44:02.700 --> 44:08.220
niantic laid off some of their staff we don't know why I suspect they were trying to push the

44:08.220 --> 44:14.620
more google glass kind of ar gaming a little sooner maybe than it was ready um and maybe

44:14.620 --> 44:20.220
that's but I I really don't know I can only speculate um but we also we know niantic has

44:20.220 --> 44:26.540
announced recently a uh a game called peridot uh an original ip that we don't know anything about

44:26.540 --> 44:31.180
yeah I'm more interested in something like that like I think honestly all these like

44:32.140 --> 44:38.300
I mean pokemon was kind of a one-off but like it's just there's no property that really gets

44:38.300 --> 44:43.420
me excited I love marvel stuff but like I am not excited at all about this and I get it I may not

44:43.420 --> 44:48.460
be their target demographic although I don't know who would be then at that point but like it's just

44:49.980 --> 44:54.380
I like the Pikmin game but I've talked about that a lot on the show and that is more I also

44:55.340 --> 45:00.380
unlike you I have a default love for the ar and get outside and explore kind of games I've always

45:00.380 --> 45:06.140
been a fan of niantic and that genre so that's you know that's it's obviously something um

45:06.780 --> 45:12.860
something there um so uh what else do we know the nba game was announced that is coming but

45:12.860 --> 45:16.860
we don't know much about that either so I think that's what the problem people are starting to

45:16.860 --> 45:20.940
have when niantic is is that you're you're announcing too many things that either don't

45:20.940 --> 45:25.980
come out or we don't know anything about it so niantic might want to re-examine their pipeline

45:25.980 --> 45:29.900
from announcement to release because they've got too much now that they've announced that

45:29.900 --> 45:35.740
they haven't released I get that they they made the announcement now because d23 so yeah that's

45:35.740 --> 45:39.580
fine that makes sense it didn't it didn't have to be d23 it could have been any time

45:40.620 --> 45:47.660
but here's here's why I think it's actually super newsworthy um is because when pokemon go came out

45:48.460 --> 45:54.460
everybody tried to copy it and make their own type of pokemon go I don't think anyone was

45:54.460 --> 46:01.180
successful at it what we had garfield go uh we had draconian go or whatever it was called

46:01.180 --> 46:06.380
we had the jurassic park game which I feel like a couple people played that but I don't even think

46:06.380 --> 46:11.740
that one's a big deal anymore and we just have seen that like in general other companies trying

46:11.740 --> 46:17.980
to take on the strength of pokemon go wasn't working and I said from the very beginning it's

46:17.980 --> 46:24.220
going to take a very strong ip to compete with pokemon go in fact I think the only company

46:24.220 --> 46:27.100
that could really take on pokemon go would be disney

46:29.260 --> 46:36.220
so the part of this news that strikes me as oh that's interesting is that disney isn't taking

46:36.220 --> 46:42.700
it on they're partnering up so from my perspective whether you like it or not

46:43.340 --> 46:48.540
niantic is now going to have the monopoly on these ar games for quite some time

46:49.500 --> 46:55.900
until someone else can figure out a way to build a database of real world locations and collecting

46:55.900 --> 47:00.860
this type of information that niantic is cleverly getting from their player base like portal scans

47:00.860 --> 47:05.180
and pokestop scans and all this stuff that shows the stuff on the ground all this

47:05.180 --> 47:10.540
unless another company can really think of a way to take that on in a way that niantic is now

47:10.540 --> 47:18.220
already two or three steps ahead with this is this is like microsoft and game pass niantic is now

47:18.220 --> 47:24.460
already three steps ahead of anyone else and this disney partnership now that there's nobody even

47:24.460 --> 47:31.820
in the rearview mirror at this point so I that part to me is what's interesting is that yeah

47:31.820 --> 47:37.020
disney just decided if he can't beat him join him mike defton chat says if you can't beat him

47:37.020 --> 47:41.180
buy him I don't could could could disney buy niantic at this point I don't know

47:41.180 --> 47:45.100
niantic may be too much money I I think they're worth a lot more than people think

47:45.900 --> 47:51.580
but then again disney certainly has no shortage of money so I don't think disney wants to get

47:51.580 --> 47:58.460
into gaming per se and they have lucasarts but like they're not really doing much with gaming

47:58.460 --> 48:03.420
like it's very clearly they have no interest in making their own ar game so they are letting

48:03.420 --> 48:08.140
niantic do it right so I don't think that they would purchase niantic I don't think they're it

48:08.140 --> 48:16.060
yeah because for what yeah it like it would have to be like an amazing success like beyond pokemon

48:16.060 --> 48:24.460
go to even drum up interest enough to do that yeah the the reason why someone will buy niantic

48:24.460 --> 48:32.460
won't be the um games themselves it'll be the data niantic is amassing about the usage and

48:32.460 --> 48:37.020
what the ground really looks like at some of those areas and stuff but that's that's the type of data

48:37.020 --> 48:41.500
somebody's gonna want to buy from niantic at some point which is why niantic is kind of smart to

48:41.500 --> 48:44.620
sort of license it in their own thing with the whole light shift but that's a whole

48:45.180 --> 48:51.980
whole other thing anyway I think this is very interesting um again it's hard to say uh if the

48:51.980 --> 48:56.380
game is going to be any good or not when we have literally not even seen one frame but just as

48:56.380 --> 49:01.180
someone who's generally a fan usually of niantic stuff and I've talked at length about them on the

49:01.180 --> 49:07.900
show um I wish them well I want to see it be good um good luck I can't wait to actually get my hands

49:07.900 --> 49:12.780
on it hopefully so all right let's talk about the things we have gotten our hands on in this past

49:12.780 --> 49:18.860
week let's talk about our gaming weeks I know I've had a lot low-key what about your gaming week what

49:18.860 --> 49:25.100
do you mean it's all been minecraft I've been working on a single build for about a month now

49:25.100 --> 49:33.260
designing it so it's now being it's done being designed it's probably going to be the largest

49:33.260 --> 49:39.580
thing I've ever built I think you're gonna like it you just had something that you built that was

49:39.580 --> 49:45.500
like the largest thing you ever built so you're one yeah that was yeah that was a mountain uh

49:45.500 --> 49:51.580
a while back those 200,000 blocks I think this is like 300,000 at least it's very large it is

49:51.580 --> 50:00.540
incredibly large but it it's pretty awesome it is mega man themed oh cool but it is it it is not my

50:00.540 --> 50:06.060
mega base but it could it could have been my mega base if if I really wanted to be it's that big

50:06.060 --> 50:12.140
but it is not a mega base it is just decoration the copper farm all right well everyone stay

50:12.220 --> 50:17.580
tuned to Loki's uh youtube channel to uh check that out when it hits all right well as I've been

50:17.580 --> 50:23.660
home sick and I I was I was supposed to go back to work Thursday obviously I didn't I've been home

50:23.660 --> 50:27.180
pretty much sleeping and playing video games so I've had a lot uh and then of course there was

50:27.180 --> 50:30.620
Dragon Con as well so pull up a chair I've got a few things to get into but I'll try to be quick

50:31.420 --> 50:36.220
the game I've been playing most this week this week and weekend is Diablo 3 which I know is

50:36.220 --> 50:41.260
kind of old but I've talked about it before I recently got back into it because I didn't really

50:41.260 --> 50:47.660
care for Diablo Immortal um after the first 40 levels or so but um it made me realize I really

50:47.660 --> 50:54.540
like Diablo 3 and I've been enjoying season 27 I'm up to Paragon 650 which is higher than I've

50:54.540 --> 51:02.220
ever gotten Paragon wise Alan is up to 1200 uh in the season in the season not overall so uh

51:02.220 --> 51:05.340
we've been both playing a lot of that game but it's been something we've been able to play

51:05.340 --> 51:10.140
together which is cute so uh we've been having fun with that I have a wizard and I'm up to

51:10.140 --> 51:15.020
greater rift level I think I cleared 90 earlier so I'm trying to work my way up into the hundreds

51:15.660 --> 51:22.620
um I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14 Final Fantasy 14 right before I left for Dragon Con

51:22.620 --> 51:28.460
released the new island sanctuary mode which is interesting because I know Disney also put out

51:28.460 --> 51:33.900
their own Disney dream light which is kind of like this you know farming sim animal crossing sim sort

51:33.900 --> 51:38.700
of game well they've also put something like this into Final Fantasy 14 with the island sanctuary

51:38.700 --> 51:45.980
you go around and you gather materials you build things you then uh use the workshops to uh build

51:45.980 --> 51:51.500
things you can export for items that you can then turn into cosmetic rewards like mounts and things

51:51.500 --> 51:56.540
and all this stuff so you build up your island you can capture animals you keep them in a little part

51:56.540 --> 52:02.220
of your sanctuary you grow plants so like it's got this whole little farm sim mode that's very

52:02.220 --> 52:07.500
addicting in it right now that's been a lot of fun so I'm logging into that like every day to um

52:07.500 --> 52:12.700
progress my island sanctuary so I don't raid my only savage content I do right now is savage

52:12.700 --> 52:16.940
island sanctuary um and I've been having a lot of fun with that I've still been continuing in Dead

52:16.940 --> 52:22.940
by Daylight as well uh they just released the project W or the um second Resident Evil pack

52:22.940 --> 52:28.940
um which has made way too many Weskers in the killer pool um but he is an interesting killer and

52:28.940 --> 52:33.980
uh you know very very hot like everybody from Resident Evil is so hot like I don't what what

52:33.980 --> 52:40.700
is up like now I play Carlos super hot Ada Wong I also really hot like everybody is so hot from

52:40.700 --> 52:45.660
Resident Evil um but I've been having fun playing the new characters um and just you know in general

52:45.660 --> 52:53.260
leveling up um on the plane ride out to Dragon Con I played some Super Mario Brothers 2 on my Switch

52:53.260 --> 52:59.420
because I was like I want to play a retro title and uh you know uh play something I can play start

52:59.420 --> 53:07.900
to finish um on a plane ride so that's what I've been playing um then when I was at Dragon Con

53:07.900 --> 53:14.780
Dragon Con had a whole little um they had two arcades they had a classic game room that was

53:14.780 --> 53:20.460
also a bar and karaoke place and at the classic game room I got to play a bit of gyrus I actually

53:20.460 --> 53:25.100
had the high score no I'm sorry the second high score on the gyrus machine for a hot minute because

53:25.100 --> 53:30.060
I actually can still remember from the Commodore 64 days where the ship needs to be positioned in

53:30.060 --> 53:34.620
the first few stages to get a perfect on everything so that's kind of fun I played some Street Fighter

53:34.620 --> 53:39.260
2 with some friends that was very old school uh e Honda if you were wondering uh and then I played

53:39.260 --> 53:43.340
some Mortal Kombat 2 as well so they had some great classic games and then I thought this was

53:43.340 --> 53:49.980
really funny I watched my friend my friend saw this machine and he goes oh my god it's Galaga

53:49.980 --> 53:53.820
I gotta go play Galaga I used to play so much Galaga when I was growing up and I was like

53:54.620 --> 54:00.300
are you are you talking about Galaga he's he's like Galaga we always call the Galaga and I was

54:00.300 --> 54:06.140
like I I think friend I think um I think it's Galaga because like galaxy it's galaxy if you're

54:06.140 --> 54:14.860
in the galaxy it's Galaga what no it's it's Galaga and I was like okay well I watched him proceed to

54:14.860 --> 54:21.100
get a very very large score on the Galaga machine so he was not just making this shit up he played

54:21.100 --> 54:25.740
a lot of Galaga growing up and was still able to do very well for himself and it was the same thing

54:26.620 --> 54:33.260
he knew everywhere you needed to be on the screen and so forth and all that stuff so dark soccer and

54:33.260 --> 54:39.580
chat says you were always wrong here's the thing he's a friend I'd like him to stay my friend

54:40.300 --> 54:47.020
is there hurting anything do I need to shit on his childhood no I I said what I needed to say oh

54:47.020 --> 54:52.220
oh I thought it was Galaga like galaxy and he did acknowledge oh yeah you're probably right

54:52.220 --> 55:01.020
and then continued to call it Galaga why why should I stop that what it's there's no harm in it

55:01.020 --> 55:09.500
um and uh there was also a Japanese arcade so they used to have Tokyo Attack was the name of

55:09.500 --> 55:15.740
the arcade but they Tokyo Attack went under for reasons and things um a couple years ago

55:15.820 --> 55:21.980
so now there is a um a new company I think they're called Savepoint Arcade uh Bobby may have to

55:21.980 --> 55:26.700
correct me on the name if I'm wrong but uh they were the ones that now come out and they brought

55:26.700 --> 55:33.900
the Japanese like uh centered machines to the con and they had like a BeatMania 2DX Beastrover

55:33.900 --> 55:38.060
I didn't realize they were gonna have freaking EMUs turned on or I would have turned on EMUs

55:38.060 --> 55:44.060
so Bobby even got me some footage um of playing that game which he showed on his own show and

55:44.060 --> 55:49.900
that was cool to play 2DX machine he they also had a BeatMania the final I hadn't seen one of

55:49.900 --> 55:57.020
those machines since god did we go to like I think it was little Tokyo in LA was the last place I

55:57.020 --> 56:02.140
ever saw one of those BeatMania the final machines so that was a trip to see that and I could not

56:02.140 --> 56:07.500
remember how to play the songs uh on that game arcade infinity I think it's the last time I saw

56:07.500 --> 56:13.020
that yeah yeah uh Bobby Blackwolf and chat says save point yes technically they aren't a new

56:13.020 --> 56:18.300
company but they have stepped into the business that Tokyo Attack had okay awesome uh and then

56:18.300 --> 56:22.700
the other game I got to play they had a lot more but the other game I actually played was Dance

56:22.700 --> 56:27.500
Maniacs because you know if you've it's the one where you wave on the top and on the bottom and

56:27.500 --> 56:34.460
it's a lot of fun and I miss that game so uh yeah I got to uh play a little bit of that so um Dark

56:34.460 --> 56:39.260
Soccer I do not think this is the same group that does California Extreme because I I they're East

56:39.260 --> 56:43.900
Coast based now granted if they're based in Maryland as Bobby says that is still quite the

56:43.900 --> 56:47.980
trip uh but probably coming all the way out to the West Coast is even more of a trip there's

56:47.980 --> 56:51.980
probably another company on the West Coast that does a lot of this stuff out here so um yeah and

56:51.980 --> 56:56.780
if the 2DX machine was different then it probably wasn't the same group um but there's probably a

56:56.780 --> 57:01.420
very similar group on the West Coast for sure um but getting over the Rockies with all those

57:01.420 --> 57:04.700
machines is probably a big pain in the butt so you're probably always going to have your West

57:04.700 --> 57:08.540
Coast and your East Coast and maybe maybe a Midwest company in there too who knows

57:09.500 --> 57:15.660
um and then uh I I know the one you all want to hear about is uh the night I did stay at

57:15.660 --> 57:20.540
Black Wolf Manor you know that Bobby Black Wolf has his own arcade right and he has his own

57:20.540 --> 57:28.140
uh a few machines he has a Tron machine uh well these are these are um arcade one-ups like the one

57:28.140 --> 57:31.580
the one behind me if you're watching live on Twitch if you're on the podcast feed you don't

57:31.580 --> 57:36.460
see it but I have a Burger Time or a Data East arcade one-up replica cabinet

57:36.460 --> 57:44.460
uh that sits behind me here um so uh Black Wolf has a Tron one and I joked and I said for some

57:44.460 --> 57:48.460
time Bobby I'm coming over to your house I'm getting the high score on your Tron machine

57:49.020 --> 57:55.820
and all I did all I did audience I did simply what I was going to say or what I said I was going to

57:55.820 --> 58:02.540
do and I got the high score on his Tron machine with some practice it wasn't a great score so

58:02.540 --> 58:06.220
with some practice Bobby will take it out in the next year and then he'll rub it in I'm sure and

58:06.220 --> 58:11.580
it'll be fine I also played his Star Wars machine I did not get the high score on the Star Wars

58:11.580 --> 58:15.260
machine I think if you wanted to get the high score on that machine you needed to start on

58:15.260 --> 58:21.340
level nine and get the bonus for beating level nine I didn't do that so there was there was that

58:22.220 --> 58:27.100
uh I also got to play pinball at Bobby's house Bobby has a Mandalorian machine which I think

58:27.100 --> 58:32.620
he had last year because I remember playing that before um but he now has a Rush like the band a

58:32.620 --> 58:39.180
Rush pinball table that was a lot of fun to play this was really cool I didn't know anything about

58:39.180 --> 58:45.100
this until well it's like I heard here's the thing I'd heard of it and it's one thing to hear it

58:45.100 --> 58:50.540
it's another thing to see it and do it and use it and this is the first time I used it

58:50.540 --> 58:57.340
and that was Stern's QR code system they have now so they have this site that you can log into

58:57.820 --> 59:04.380
uh with Stern pinball and you can actually scan a QR code on machines when you play them so it's

59:04.380 --> 59:10.540
insider.sternpinball.com and there's this uh uh thing oh damn it I'm not logged in I was I was

59:10.540 --> 59:15.820
going to show you the site otherwise um and you can log in a machine by scanning your QR code

59:15.820 --> 59:20.380
and the really cool thing about that you get achievements and it tracks on your phone the

59:20.380 --> 59:25.100
things you played and you have your own personal records and stuff like that and I think that is

59:25.100 --> 59:32.460
brilliant because it brings something additional to pinball besides just pinball which is great

59:32.460 --> 59:38.140
don't get me wrong but the thing with that is that you pay your dollar and you're done and you rarely

59:38.140 --> 59:42.860
have anything to show for it it's like okay I had my little thrill for the experience I knocked some

59:42.860 --> 59:49.340
balls around teehee and I'm done but now with this QR code thing if it's set up on the machine

59:49.340 --> 59:53.340
not every Stern machine has them it's a separate thing they sell but Bobby Bobby put it on his

59:53.340 --> 59:58.860
machines that he has with this QR code thing you scan the QR code thing and you get achievements

59:58.860 --> 01:00:04.220
and you get to track your scores and all this really cool stuff so I played the rush table one

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:09.100
time and then Bobby told me about the QR code thing and I was like oh cool I gotta try that

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.940
and I'm like I want to get some achievements so let me try the rush table again I want to get some

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:19.980
achievements so I played the rush table again with my QR code and all this stuff and um balls

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:27.100
one and two didn't go so well ball three I went on a fucking bender on ball three I was alive for

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:33.100
a very long time on ball three and um I beat Bobby's high score on the rush machine too

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:40.540
oh that one I felt a little bad about because I didn't walk in there intending to do that

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:48.620
so I may or may not have gotten myself into a little hot water and there may or may not

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:55.180
literally be a sign outside of Bobby's arcade with my face on it at this point that says have

01:00:55.180 --> 01:01:01.740
you seen this man or whatever it is and I just happen to have a shirt that day that said um

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.300
sorry I was mean to you on the internet

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:12.860
which I'd randomly bought at the mall uh a few weeks ago so I I said that so at that point I

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:18.300
wanted to play Mandalorian again I think I played it once just to like register that I'd played as

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:24.300
I was too afraid to do well on that machine because I don't want to make Bobby Blackwolf

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:30.140
cry like I don't want to make him cry like he's been very good you know what we have a good time

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:35.340
at Dragon Con we do some great business partner things together I got to watch him moderate some

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:39.820
awesome panels with the guys from Mortal Kombat and all this stuff he lets me stay at it I don't

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:46.700
want to make him cry so I had to I had to purposely kind of have a quick game of Mandalorian and let

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:54.700
that let that be that so luckily Mrs Blackwolf has already told me that she does not recognize

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:59.740
or authorize the ban or the signage that is outside the arcade so Mrs Blackwolf has

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:08.620
said I am welcome whenever I want so um Dark Soccer says Tron is at my house right now oh

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:13.580
the machine or the table because honestly I'd play either uh you probably don't want me coming over

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:18.780
right now uh but maybe in a week or so I'd love to come uh play that uh Dark Soccer says did my

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:24.620
friend Annie ever come by to say hi uh no I didn't I didn't meet any Annie so sorry to say but um

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:30.700
it there was no uh Dead by Daylight panels or anything like that so um I don't know if she's

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:34.780
your friend from that circle or somewhere else I don't know but um yeah didn't run into him

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:40.860
I will say one of the panels that we did was was the line capped an hour before the panel

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.820
and it seems like a lot of people who are trying to say hi to me or Bobby tried to come to that

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:52.620
panel uh and it was capped an hour beforehand because the Macarons were also on that so oh she

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:57.820
hosts some I heart podcast no I didn't see her sorry to say so um I guess there's always Dragon

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:05.100
Con 2023 because I I will be back I sure will I'm bummed that booster shot that's out there

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:09.180
now wasn't available two weeks sooner because I absolutely would have got it you know precautions

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:16.300
work but it is what it is when precautions are not followed here I am I follow them but everybody

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:21.740
has to follow them for them to work all right that's plenty enough about my gaming week oh I

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:25.420
should have mentioned the tilt five because Bobby did let me try that for the first time do you know

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:33.260
what the tilt five is Loki oh okay so long story short it's these glasses you wear and you stare

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:38.300
at this table thing it's they made it more for board games I think Bobby heard about it at Gen

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:43.500
Con but they have you know other like concept video games I I played a thing that was we'll

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:47.580
call it marble madness it wasn't actually marble madness but it was like a marble madness type of

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:52.460
thing or a monkey ball type of thing and you stare at this table and you see the image on

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:56.860
the table and as you look around it like moves with you and so forth because like it's like

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:02.060
projecting from the glasses onto this reflective material that's on the table and so it makes it

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:08.140
look like it's like um it's it's like a it's not VR it's a little more like AR but it's it's pretty

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:14.860
cool um till five is Jerry Ellsworth's AR goggles she was working on the valve cast AR before they

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:20.940
went VR that's Bobby's little summary there that was neat to see um but I didn't really get to

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:26.220
play any games on it it was just one concept demo so I'll be curious I watched Bobby do something

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:30.300
that looked a little Diablo-y to me and I was like what's that and he was uh because I guess

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:34.060
they had released some update and some new demos while we were at Dragon Con so he was kind of

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:37.900
trying them all for the first time so it feels like one of those things that still has a little

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:41.980
baking to do um so I'll be curious to see what kind of experiences they put on that that are

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:47.900
uniquely um for that tilt five okay now I have definitely talked too much about my gaming week

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:55.580
so let's get into some other gaming news uh let's get to it Loki yeah so there was also an Ubisoft

01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:03.180
event where they talked about game announcements in a couple franchises um so some of the non

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:09.100
Ubisoft Assassin's Creed and Division announcements we had Mario and Rabbids

01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:15.580
Sparks of Hope they showed off some more um a new trailer I think for that and that's set to come

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:27.340
out on the Switch October 20th and um also uh more on Skull and Bones still on its way um apparently

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:33.500
if uh you are part of Ubisoft's insider program uh you may be able to get a chance to play an early

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:39.660
version of the game uh Riders Republic is getting a season four update called Freestyling that

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:46.380
they're going to have um some skate parks and whatnot to actually be able to uh play in and

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:54.700
I think they're also adding BMX to that as well and I think that was oh um Netflix uh they're

01:05:54.700 --> 01:06:00.700
going to be teaming up with them for a few different things I think Ubisoft related

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:08.060
I want to say they have an Assassin's Creed um game and tv show I'm not really sure what that's

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:15.260
about um Mighty Quest and Valiant Hearts 2 are I think mobile games that are going to be part of

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:23.180
Netflix's like gaming servicing that no one really cares about um Mythic Quest season three had a

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:28.460
uh trailer for that I can't believe that's on season three so that's I think still on Apple TV

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:38.380
um they talked about a free trial for Ubisoft Plus which is like a game pass on PC thing for

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:42.940
Ubisoft titles that's going to be um they're going to have a trail for that starting I think now it

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:49.420
runs until October 10th uh Trackmania a new version of that game is coming out supposed to

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:53.980
be free to play with no micro transactions so I'm not sure how they're making their money there

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:57.500
but there's going to be two premium tiers as well that you can buy into and they said the

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:04.460
seasonal updates every three months and that's supposed to be on all the modern consoles as well

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:11.660
uh Rocksmith Plus is like a I'm not sure if that's still going to be the similar I don't think

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:16.620
still have the accessories that go along with that but maybe a service that you can still learn how

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:20.860
to play the guitar and whatnot which is kind of cool uh new Just Dance game because of course

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:29.580
um and then a whole lot of Assassin's Creed whole lot Assassin's Creed so Assassin's Creed Mirage

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:38.300
which is the next big mainline game uh which is going to take place in um was it 9th century

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:45.100
Baghdad uh looks kind of cool they have an Assassin's Creed documentary talking about

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:49.340
the development of the game Assassin's Creed Valhalla is getting a last chapter for free

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:56.540
Assassin's Creed Codename Jade is going to be a mobile game that takes place in China in uh

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:04.060
215 BCE uh Assassin's Creed the the Netflix show we talked about a second ago they're

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:11.260
um not really sure what that's still going to be about but they're going to have a TV show as well

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:17.180
uh there is Assassin's Creed Codename Red which is supposed to take place in feudal Japan

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:23.660
Assassin's Creed Codename Hex which sort of has looks like the Blair Witch or something

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:28.460
something that has to do with witchcraft um and Assassin's Creed Infinity which is supposed to

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:34.060
somehow tie all this crap together this is what it sounds like when you're milking a franchise to

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:40.780
death so somebody has somebody has some lights to keep on over there good luck Ubisoft with that

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:49.180
Jesus Christ like um and then of course along with another franchise uh The Division so Tom Clancy's

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:58.380
The Division 2 um they're going to be doing like a new uh PvE mode and some other progression stuff

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:04.140
uh they said that there's supposed to be a season 10 with some quality life updates and

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:09.100
new difficulty modes and then season 11 is supposed to continue with the main story

01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:16.620
uh Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland which is going to take place in middle America uh

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:26.220
there's also this Division Resurgence which is a mobile game uh that's going to be coming out

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:31.980
then Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Mobile also getting um you know obviously it's a mobile game as well

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:39.740
what else uh well we have some thoughts from chat uh Sia Tabiri says can I get an Assassin's Creed

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:45.180
that's set in the Edwardian area era excuse me and I'm actually just making clothes the entire time

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:54.380
don't encourage these people on further spin-offs because you joke but you know what why not a

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:59.500
farming sim set in the Assassin's Creed universe it's it's a cool new thing to do right now so

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:06.060
why not why not add clothes into that too Assassin's Creed My Little Cottage why not

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.580
you're also getting Assassin's Creed Symphonic Adventure which is a live concert

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:20.940
uh a podcast and a figurine who needs who needs a new podcast who needs any of those

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:28.940
I don't know like is there like I get it Assassin's Creed's a good it like I'm just

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:33.100
picturing for a second like if this was like Grand Theft Auto like if these were all like

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:37.420
Grand Theft Auto games that are being announced I would think that that's even too much like I'd be

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:42.380
like hold on like what the hell some of these sound cool like the Codename Red thing looks

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:46.220
cool but like that should be the game of the year you can't have like four four Assassin's

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:50.380
Creed games coming out at the same time like that is just ridiculous and I know these are

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:56.300
not all coming out the same time but like you know I don't need to know the 10 year

01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:00.620
this is not the Marvel Cinematic Universe I don't need to know like the 10 mainline games

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:07.820
you have coming out for this series like just make a good game let's focus on the fruit in

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:13.740
the next game make it a good game please um going to an earlier comment in chat from I hope I don't

01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:18.860
butcher this name Jess seven x uh in chat says will Beyond Good and Evil 2 ever come out

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:25.980
well you know it wasn't part of this so probably not you know what Dead Island 2 is apparently

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:30.380
finally happening so anything's possible um it ain't happening until it's actually out so

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:35.180
what's probably happening is that the fucking thing's getting delayed so much now they have

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:39.420
to re-scope it for a new console think about it when that game was first announced it was probably

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:46.940
being targeted for playstation 3 xbox 360 we're now on the playstation 5 and the xbox series x

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:51.580
like they're probably having to target that or maybe even beyond that at this point so it's

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:56.860
you know that that's probably what keeps pushing the thing back if you miss your target you can

01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:03.340
really really miss your target and now you have to re-scope everything so so yeah but it's it's uh

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:07.660
I mean we haven't heard it's gotten cancelled but it could be one of those things where they're

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:11.980
basically gonna have to scrap it and start all over uh something more akin to what happened

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:20.220
with like final fantasy 15 duke nukem forever so you know let's see uh going to yeah quest buster

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:26.300
in chat says even as a ac I keep thinking animal crossing when I say ac which is funny but even as

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:32.540
an assassin's creed fan this seems like a lot of assassin's creed yes uh I guess the continues

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:37.980
quest buster I guess the uh ac version taking place in japan sounds cool right now but I'm

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:42.300
still thinking about ghost of Tsushima and how much more excited I am for an eventual sequel to

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:50.220
that uh ssho100 matt says eaves did an interview uh the ceo of ubisoft who you know we hate uh

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:53.660
where he basically strained himself patting himself on the back about the response of the

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:58.860
abuse scandal actual ubisoft employees are saying otherwise about said response actually happening

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:05.500
lift up those voices to make sure they catch the attention of the media and don't

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:11.340
let eaves gilmont drive that dialogue because that's exactly what he's trying to do with his

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:17.020
statements to the contrary so I hope uh the media will continue to report on what the workers are

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:22.940
actually saying about what's actually happening on that front which is not enough so uh eaves

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:28.060
gilmont probably needs to be removed as ceo already and if these 500 assassin's creed games

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:32.780
don't sell maybe that might finally happen although I somehow still still seem to doubt it

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:38.380
with um you know the amount of the stakeholder they have and all of that right pretty much yeah

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:45.580
yeah I can't imagine that'll happen all right um moving on to our next story uh it turns out that

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:53.260
facebook gaming is going to be losing their apps now I want to point out this doesn't mean that

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:59.580
it's been announced that facebook gaming is going away but this is how mixer started

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:06.620
the the beginning of the end basically um so facebook has sent out notifications to

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:11.900
partners that the apps will be shutting down in october and I guess one could argue youtube

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:17.180
gaming has also already done something similar and youtube gaming still has a presence so

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:25.180
it doesn't necessarily mean the end but it should be noted that facebook gaming has not really found

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:30.300
meaningful growth uh in game streaming the same way that um twitch and youtube have found those

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:39.260
things uh so yeah uh facebook gaming of course is run by meta uh they expanded even to irl streams

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:45.820
things like you know chatting art creation excel esports whatever uh they've got it on there uh

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:52.220
during the pandemic things like youtube and twitch have really gone up but facebook hasn't so much in

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:58.380
fact even facebook as a platform itself has seen declines in monthly active users earlier this year

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:07.020
and 20 of its share price uh was lost as a result so hmm so facebook gaming notified partners it is

01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:13.260
going to be uh ending the mobile game streaming apps uh it is saying that they are continuing to

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:18.780
support game streaming within facebook itself but that doesn't mean that it's going to be something

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:23.420
they're going to continue to focus on or put a lot of money into and you might know that they've

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:30.140
put a lot of money into trying to get uh big talent over at um facebook gaming so

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:36.460
yeah it looks like it looks like it might be the beginning of the end for facebook gaming oh and

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:41.900
what's this in the article it looks like uh uh when reached out for comment uh rob roberts

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:47.020
from orange lounge radio the longest running podcast had the following to say about it

01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:55.580
nah

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.580
i'm only petty sometimes

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:17.980
move but let's be real i hated the fact that facebook was getting into this space

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:21.980
i never liked them being in it and quite frankly i can't wait for them to get out

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:29.740
so sorry to my friends that use that platform to stream on stream on i don't want to say i told you

01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:30.060
sell

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:39.340
have they tried like uh hot tub streams you know because i hear that this needs to be popular

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:51.420
low-key all right uh let's move on to uh our next story low-key uh this is funny this is a a

01:16:51.420 --> 01:17:02.220
response um or the the playstation boss apparently calls out microsoft over um you know the inadequate

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:08.940
call of duty deal they're saying so you may remember that microsoft has committed that

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:14.380
call of duty is still going to be on the playstation platforms for now um at least you

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:23.420
know for at least several more years um but they're saying that um he basically said i

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:27.900
hadn't intended to comment on what i understand to be private business discussion but i feel

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:32.060
i need to set the record straight because phil spencer brought this into a public forum

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:37.660
throwing shade already um microsoft has only offered call of duty to remain on playstation

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:43.660
for three years after the current agreement between activision and sony ends after uh almost

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:48.220
20 years of call of duty on playstation their proposal was inadequate on many levels

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:55.180
and failed to take an account of the impact on our gamers we want to guarantee playstation gamers

01:17:55.180 --> 01:18:00.060
continue to have the highest quality quality experience and microsoft's proposal undermines

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:09.420
this principle says the company or wasn't it sony or maybe i'm thinking maybe it was microsoft

01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:15.820
somebody had like the tomb raider exclusive rights or would they do these timed things all the time

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:22.220
so that's like pot con that's the pot calling the kettle black at this point like microsoft sorry

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:26.940
like i don't microsoft had rise of the tomb raider for a year yeah yeah exactly but sony still has

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:33.340
final fantasy 7 remake exclusive exactly we haven't nailed that exactly and so and they've

01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:40.860
had other exclusives before that as well um honestly like be glad they gave you three years dude

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:47.660
seriously like be glad they gave me look on one hand sony is just doing what they have to do from

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:53.260
a business sense like it right it would not be good business for them not to take a swing at it

01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:58.300
you know however they feel the need to do it it doesn't make them right but i understand why they

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:03.740
have to say this stuff because you know legally it would they they are in the business of making

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:09.980
money and for them to roll over and you know have this franchise potentially leave them even in four

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:15.820
years with as much money as it makes is a big deal yeah it's what here's how it's gonna go down i

01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:23.180
think is they'll keep it cross-platform for now on sony's platform until the playstation 6 whatever

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:28.300
the next xbox console gets announced and we're talking about new console launching and it's like

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:32.300
oh hey well if you won't play call of duty you got to come to this console now yeah that's how

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:37.500
it's going to go because um right now it is in their best interest to keep it multi-platform

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:42.060
because they're going to make a ton of money off of those users but later on when they were trying

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:47.980
to sway people to buy into an xbox console that's how you do it leverage with this stuff and i'm

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:51.340
sorry but like you can cry all about you want but you're doing the same thing so

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:59.020
i don't know whatever um sj100 matt chat says serious question if sony made this deal with abk

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:04.460
instead of microsoft would sony be as generous with microsoft or as this or would they pull it

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:08.220
from anything that's not pc or sony consoles they would have pulled it immediately you'll have a

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:15.980
chance to find out whenever destiny 3 happens so you know sony sony's been buying their own

01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:22.220
companies lately too uh so you'll have a chance to find out if rumors are to be believed sony

01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:25.980
will own square enix eventually i don't know how i don't know how much i believe that one but you

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:32.220
know anything is possible at this point so uh bobby blackwolf says sony will say we're not

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:36.220
doing the same thing with the top selling games in this country as what bobby says in chat so

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:43.740
yeah all right meanwhile anybody that's interested in playing any of these games

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:50.700
pc man you get sony games you get microsoft games you got everything yeah i mean i love

01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:56.060
consoles still i do but you know there's lots of great if you but pc you just have to make sure

01:20:56.060 --> 01:21:00.860
you have the the pc that can handle these newer games and that's not really in the realm of

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:04.780
affordability for a lot of people so there's definitely still a place for consoles for sure

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:11.340
um before i get into the next story i wanted to mention this comment on the last story about uh

01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:17.580
facebook uh from uh sj100 matt who said uh zuckerberg uh couldn't be reached for comment

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:25.740
he was in his awkward metaverse that was that i don't how is any how is anybody supposed to

01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:30.860
believe that the metaverse is the next big thing with those like it looks like something that

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:35.660
would have been at least clarified that that was an early screenshot and then they have better

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:40.460
stuff but like yeah it doesn't matter though because it's just uninteresting i don't care

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:45.740
if it's like super photorealistic it's still boring like it doesn't matter like what are you

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:51.660
doing with it like how how does this revolutionize anything other than it being a chat room that you

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:57.180
do unnecessary like you want me to go work there too yeah like no uh when pushed for further

01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:04.860
comments zuckerberg also said solo sucks anyway um let's see also uh in chat uh metaverse bobby

01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:08.540
blackwolf there's like three people that'll get that joke bobby blackwolf says playstation home

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:13.580
looked better than that metaverse yes sj100 matt says second life looks better than that metaverse

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:19.900
yes that's a lot of the big problem with it that's for sure all right going to this last story sorry

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:24.540
i'm getting the comments out of order but i'm reading as fast as i can um she-hole 10 i thought

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:31.420
had a great perspective here saying call of duty will have to replace a broken halo series 343

01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:36.700
studios dropped the ball on halo yeah you know i have been hearing a lot of not great stuff out

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:41.660
of halo like the whole like uh split screen mode ended up getting cancelled and just like

01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:47.820
they're not but you can glitch it back into the game somehow yeah that the the the road map and

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:53.260
and the the direction that halo reach has been going not where they hope that would be that's

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:59.340
for sure so that is very interesting what she-hole brings up though is that maybe microsoft needs a

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:06.220
shooter to fill a gap that their current shooter is is not filling for people very interesting

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:15.180
so yeah all right anyhow uh let's move on and talk about more news uh we were talking about

01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:19.660
conventions earlier in the show and there's another one uh that was scheduled to come up

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:25.260
in january it's awesome games done quick uh but it will no longer be happening in person it was

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:30.300
going to be happening in florida but they announced this week that uh games done quick

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:35.180
uh the 2023 awesome games done quick event will be online it's going to be virtual again

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:41.180
january 8th through the 15th but here's the interesting thing they already had one of these

01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:48.220
in person so it isn't covid directly that's responsible for the reason why they're shifting

01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:54.140
this online however there's a couple reasons why they're shifting this online uh the organizers

01:23:54.140 --> 01:24:00.380
want to return in person but in order to quote provide a safe and welcoming event to all they

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:05.420
need to move away from their plan location in florida in the statement they said given the

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:13.900
state's continued disregard for covid 19's dangers including anti-mandate policies and an increased

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:20.380
aggression towards lgbtq individuals including the law colloquially known as don't say gay

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:27.260
we do not believe it is a safe place for our community that is taking quite a stand on both

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:33.260
those fronts uh we know that florida has not exactly been the most covid precaution

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:41.660
encouraging state while i believe they could have a mask mandate in florida still on private

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:45.900
property at the hotel if the hotel and the convention could reach that agreement like

01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:50.940
they did in minnesota for that event they just had over the summer i believe they cannot per

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:57.180
florida law mandate vaccination and i noticed they didn't call out masks in what they said they said

01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:04.060
anti-mandate policies so they can't mandate that everybody has to be vaccinated and therefore

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:10.140
they're not willing to put people at risk so that's you know what it's it's about time florida

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:14.860
paid a price for some of these things that they keep you know it just sucks that it's a charity

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.660
event but the charity is still going to make money in the online form the charity i don't think will

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:24.380
lose anything out of this and you know we're going to get more speed runs submitted from around the

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:28.140
world because more people will be able to participate more people will be able to participate

01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:32.620
virtually so i think that end of it in fact even when they did do it in person it was kind of cool

01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:36.700
that they still had some stuff that was virtual so they could really get the best of both worlds

01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:41.980
i think that's the that's the um marathon a lot of us would like to see because in person you get

01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:46.860
the in-person reactions the in-person memes like there's a lot of guys i'm not saying it should

01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:53.260
always be online i i love having a little bit of both but i i have to applaud games done quick for

01:25:53.260 --> 01:26:00.620
taking a stand and even though they they really try not to be politically uh you know motivated

01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:04.060
or whatever because you know people have their opinions all over the spectrum and what have you

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:10.060
the reality is lgbtq people there's a lot of them that volunteer and work with games done quick

01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:17.100
and florida doesn't really feel like a safe space for folks right now so i understand why they did

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:23.900
it um so i mean the charity will still have it will still make money the event will still happen

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:28.380
it'll be online we'll miss the live reaction stuff and so forth but this is what they had to do to get

01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:33.500
out of the car actually they can't get out of the contract but it's it's it's the easiest way to

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:38.220
remedy the situation we'll leave it at that right and it should be fine like it was fine the years

01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:42.860
that they had to do it online anyways it wasn't like it was a worse event it was just different

01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:49.340
so yep that is uh gonna be in january of 2022 bobby and chad is pointing out they are risking

01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:54.540
bankruptcy by doing this um good point because even though it is a charity organization

01:26:54.540 --> 01:27:01.260
um they are still an organization that has an income and an out outgoing funds and all that

01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:06.940
stuff because um they you know they run their channel throughout the year that isn't necessarily

01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:11.100
a charity fundraiser it helps them fund these different events and so forth so it's going to

01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:16.300
different events and so forth so it is a company that puts on charity events there's kind of a

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:22.060
different sort of thing to it so they they could go bankrupt from this whole thing um

01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:31.660
but i i i think it would be a really ugly look if the hotel sues this organization into oblivion

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:37.100
i i i'm you know it it is what it is we'll see what happens i realize business isn't always

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:43.740
nice or about the right thing um so we'll see what happens i wonder if and i bobby i have no

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:48.540
idea if you know this or not are they still sending a because i know when they when they

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:57.260
still do the virtual ones they send a skeleton crew to the site as basically the base of operations

01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:04.540
so technically aren't they still for seeing their contract through by sending people to that hotel

01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:08.540
as the base of operation of course i'm assuming they're still doing that maybe they're not even

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:13.580
going to do that because of the uh uh oh they do it from the virginia office says bobby they don't

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:17.260
go to the site they do it out of virginia all right then that answers that i thought they went

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:25.740
to the hotel and still did it there all right then all right uh let's move on with some more

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:31.740
stories loki what do you have for us yes so apparently twitch is permanently removing its

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:39.660
host mode on october 3rd um so apparently the hosting command and auto host features

01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:49.260
will be gone which is really stupid um i don't yeah i'm not a fan they announced their change

01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:55.820
in an update to their how to host or how to use host mode page uh saying that the experience

01:28:55.820 --> 01:29:03.980
it delivers doesn't match their expectations when they come to twitch i i don't understand why you

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:09.900
would remove it like i don't see what the gain is i'm doing that i understand that there is confusion

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:15.900
between hosting and rating and that whole thing and it causes a little bit of like you know

01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:20.860
confusion issues for especially for a newer streamer what do i do what's better and so forth

01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:26.300
but um i think one of the big problems on twitch that everybody complains about

01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:31.820
is discoverability and what's very interesting especially you know having sat on a few panels and

01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:36.460
heard a lot of perspectives from this on the digital media track at dragon con this last week

01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:41.340
it sounds like a platform that does discoverability very well is actually tik tok and i even think

01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:46.220
about my own experiences with tik tok where i posted a random video that wasn't even funny

01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:52.300
i have something like 750 views with no promotion so the discoverability on uh algorithm on tik tok

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:58.140
is pretty darn good the discoverability on twitch not the greatest usually the people that are on

01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:03.340
the front page are already partners and it ends up being a rich get richer type of situation

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:12.460
so where hosting was good was that if i'm not live i could promote a channel in my place

01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:17.260
basically on the main page in a little place that says hosting or you know channels being

01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:22.780
hosted right now and something to keep in mind that i think even twitch forget sometimes is

01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:28.940
there's a lot of us who still watch on playstation on xbox and so forth and there's a whole little

01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:34.460
bar that shows the channels that are being hosted right now and i do look through that when none of

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:39.100
my friends are live or honestly none of my friends are playing anything i really want to see i'll go

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:43.580
look through the hosting and see well what's being hosted that might be interesting to look at

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:49.100
so i think where this is frustrating people is that they're taking discoverability away that's

01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:53.900
what's happening and although twitch tries to say that well rating can take its place and so forth

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:58.940
i disagree because rating isn't something that's always there like for instance for us here at vog

01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:03.980
network we used to say at the end of the show hey put us on your auto host list because there's a lot

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:09.580
of you that probably aren't live sunday night but by hosting us then we'll show up as a recommended

01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:15.340
thing on your friends pages as something to check out that's why hosting is great rating doesn't do

01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:21.900
any of that so there is a clear difference between those two things rating is a one-time thing hosting

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:25.180
is something that was kind of always there so i think that's why it's very frustrating that we're

01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:31.020
losing it now if twitch were to turn around and say here's some discoverability we're going to

01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:36.620
put in its place i think it would soften the blow a lot better yeah what they're discovered with

01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:43.740
their um their suggestions are just give them a shout out to help them gain some followers send

01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:49.500
your viewers to their channel at the end of your stream suggest channels for viewers to um to

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:57.980
viewers when you're offline yeah like that was we could already do that it's just i don't know um

01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:04.940
yeah no i i agree now if only twitch had something very large planned for about the time that this

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:10.460
feature is sun setting to announce something new to enhance discoverability for our friends

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:15.500
if only they had a large convention with a keynote speech where they could announce something that

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:21.660
could really soften this blow a bit fingers and toes crossed well they said they're they're

01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:25.980
reasoning for it they said that uh what viewers want to interact with the streamer when they're

01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:31.020
live and host mode blocks us from happening preventing viewers from interacting with the

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:36.780
streamer they are watching also limits the streamer's growth potential um okay well then

01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:42.780
don't do that like make it so that it auto like it kind of think of it instead of an auto host

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:49.500
it's a forwarder types of things you know what's it you know and it's like i do agree with you

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:54.220
loki but you know what's interesting i've got an interesting use case for you for why it should be

01:32:54.220 --> 01:33:00.220
separate sometimes and that is what we do here at vog network for large events and we're going

01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:05.820
to lose this because of this so for example when a microsoft keynote is going on if we're having

01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:13.020
to work or something and bobby and myself or you jamie whoever is unavailable to do a simulcast

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:19.820
which we could still do we would usually host it and have our own chat that is a lot less

01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:24.620
shit posted than the large chat that's happening during a microsoft or playstation event it's

01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:31.020
just us in a chat watching the same event we could really benefit from that and many people

01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:35.980
in chat are referencing that right now although bobby is also stating the reality i could honestly

01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:40.700
count on one hand how many people participated yes that is the honest you know truth there

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:47.260
and we can still simulcast them as our schedules permit you know we so it says that the auto host

01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:52.380
will be changed to suggested channels in your channel settings i don't know what that necessarily

01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:56.700
means well i'll be curious to see what that looks like and how that might help lead to discovery

01:33:56.700 --> 01:34:01.500
because maybe that won't be as bad as we think so we'll see we'll have to see what that looks like

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:09.820
in practice so yeah all right um let's move on we're going to uh go to a classic segment that

01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:15.100
we do here on this show even though dark sakura is not here tonight we always have a plan b so

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:30.700
let's get to our next segment and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:36.780
into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of

01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:42.860
the week all right and dark soccer is not here tonight so i'm doing this segment instead tonight

01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:50.060
but i did pull a page out of dark sakura's book and i picked a game that is 10 years old in this

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:57.100
last month and this is one you're probably going to be surprised rock band blitz is the classic

01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:05.260
game of the week which was originally released on the playstation 3 august 28 2012 or on the xbox

01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:12.620
360 august 29th of 2012 that's right this game just barely qualifies that it as it just turned

01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:16.620
10 years old a couple of weeks ago and usually that's where we draw the line is that a classic

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:21.900
game of the week needs to be about 10 years old and mike defton chat over at uh twitch.tv slash

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:26.700
vlog network says i miss this game me too when i saw that this was on the lit because you know i

01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:30.700
went over and i was like what games you know turned 10 recently and i saw this and i was like

01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:37.420
no way not this game i loved this game in some ways i like this game even more than the rock band

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:40.940
games because you didn't need the plastic instruments to play it let's talk a little bit

01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:45.420
about rock band blitz those of you that are watching live can see the footage here those

01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:50.060
of you on the podcast i'll tell you a little bit about it and uh uh what we're seeing on the screen

01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:55.420
here so this was a game that was released by harmonix in 2012 as i mentioned it was only an

01:35:55.420 --> 01:36:00.300
online title so it was not something you could get retail uh it did not come with plastic instruments

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:05.820
it was meant to be played with a controller uh the gameplay mechanics were similar to other

01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:12.140
harmonix titles that had been released prior including frequency amplitude and rock band

01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:18.220
unplugged which i believe was the vita no the psp i think that one was on uh 25 songs came with

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:26.620
the game and the big clincher with this songs from any other version of the game that were exported or

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:31.660
downloaded as dlc or anything like that you could use all of it so that was what made this

01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:38.060
game awesome is that you probably had thanks to rock band you had a library of tons of songs

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:45.180
all ready to go with this but here's the bummer about this game and i'm not sure somebody who

01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:51.740
follows the wiki or either dark soccer herself may know better i don't know if we've had a game that

01:36:51.740 --> 01:37:01.420
we've spotlit that you can literally no longer play today i mean i guess well i say that but

01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:06.780
if you have it on your 360 now nobody uninstalled it through 360 but if you've never played this

01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:14.300
game before there's no way for you to get it it was delisted on august 28th 2017 so five years ago

01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:18.460
it was removed so on the five-year anniversary the game was removed and that was due to the music

01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:23.100
license expirations so we have an interesting classic game where it's like if you don't have

01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:27.660
this game there is no way for you to get it you're gonna have to find a friend that still

01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:36.300
has it on their 360 or playstation um or um uh something else oh dark soccer suggests pt

01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:40.220
she may have done at some point and that would be in a similar boat oh yeah i guess i guess

01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:46.140
that is a very similar boat where it was also delisted so there is that so anyway uh rock band

01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:52.380
blitz it's a note matching rhythm game again it's very similar designed a frequency amplitude rock

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:59.180
band unplugged you have five lanes that match lead guitar bass guitar drums vocals and keyboard

01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:04.380
and they go through the different streets oh thanks orange right pt isn't 10 years old so

01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:11.660
it couldn't have been done yet it's getting close though all right anyway um and uh there's only a

01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:15.820
single difficulty level i think that's interesting because the rock band games had different uh

01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:20.700
difficulty levels within the songs uh you can customize the controls but you use the buttons

01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:26.380
on the gamepad to basically hop between different lanes and you score points for each note that you

01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:31.420
get and once you get enough points in a lane you basically capture the lane and that lane auto

01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:37.900
plays for a portion of the song uh when you build a blitz meter you move faster along the tracks

01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:43.980
until you miss a few notes and you get a scoring bonus during that time once you complete a song

01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:49.740
you are rated on a scale of one to five stars which is reflected of your total scores and

01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:56.860
you're given both cred which unlocks power-ups and it reflects on your long-term performance

01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:04.380
you get overdrive power-ups from the cred as you get white notes it fills the overdrive meter

01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:09.660
you can then activate the overdrive power-up which is a two times scoring multiplier or you

01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:14.860
can have the computer play one note for one track for you for a period of time or you can do a

01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:21.020
bottle rocket which sends out a shock wave uh i guess an out of control car goes through the track

01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:27.500
and it scores points for all the notes that are hit you also have note-based uh power-ups uh

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:34.460
where certain notes are marked purple and uh while you hit the notes uh you do the effects of that

01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:41.180
power-up for example you can explode all notes on nearby tracks for points you can create a pinball

01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:47.420
that while it hits different notes and you keep it in play it will score points that's pretty cool

01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:52.460
and a sprite that moves between tracks that you try to catch to earn points and then lastly there

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:56.460
are track-based power-ups uh they're either active on different tracks during the song

01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:01.340
that double the point values of a particular track or it's activated when you switch a track

01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:06.140
or whatever so there's all these different things to do it also there was a facebook application for

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:10.620
this rock band world that could actually track online scoreboards so that way you can compete

01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:15.420
with friends even between xbox and playstation platforms you also because it's all about the

01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:21.660
sales would get recommended dlc uh through uh what your friends are playing and so forth so

01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:28.940
the development of this game it was a departure from past rock band titles project director

01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:33.900
matthew nordhaus referred to it as saying instead of having the focus on musical authenticity and

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:39.180
a performance simulation this is an arcade game it's fast loud silly and a little over the top

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:47.980
the game was originally called synchrony but then they changed it to rock band blitz uh and because

01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:52.460
one of the power-ups was called the blitz and that's i guess what they they got it from uh

01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:57.580
they did experiment with some other mechanics like having three notes per lane uh because i

01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:02.540
believe there's only two in what was originally or what ended up being set up uh could you use

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:08.220
analog controls for vocal tracks uh and so forth so but they they kind of threw these out we got

01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:14.300
we got what we got um they did experiment with instrument controls but ultimately found there

01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:19.340
was no easy way to include them in the title and they realized this was going to be a single player

01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:23.980
game but this is why they went to social elements like the facebook platform to kind of get that

01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:29.740
simulation of playing and challenging other people uh they launched blitz with the rock

01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:35.500
band world facebook application and then again it allowed you to compare your progress and so forth

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:41.020
so uh the game was originally premiered at the 2012 penny arcade expo east convention

01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:45.420
uh i think that was one that i went to actually and it was shown to members of the press during

01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:51.340
the game developers conference in 2012 uh at the end harmonix did say they would remove blitz from

01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:56.540
playstation and xbox live due to the expiration of music licensing agreements uh they do not have

01:41:56.540 --> 01:42:00.700
plans to make the games backwards compatible again probably because of those same licensing

01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:06.620
issues and this game is not backwards compatible on either xbox or playstation platform at this

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:14.220
time and i don't know if it ever will be uh due to the music issues so um i would go over the list

01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:19.820
but there's a lot a lot of songs in the list here so i'll just call out a few favorites you know i

01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:24.780
love me some kelly clarkson so stronger was one of the songs that was in the game raise your glass

01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:31.580
by pink moves like jagger which was all over the radio uh by maroon 5 uh was was in the game as

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:36.700
well and how about a queen song because we love queens so death on two legs uh was in the game

01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:42.060
as well but that's just really just a small portion of the list uh rock band blitz got

01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:48.140
generally a positive reception including a 77 on metacritic and a 76.9 on game rankings if you uh

01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:54.140
care about that sort of stuff uh it was praised for the core gameplay and the leaderboards but

01:42:54.140 --> 01:43:00.220
there was a criticism that it didn't really draw solo players uh that if you're not into high

01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:05.580
scores there wasn't as much of a reason to do it uh it was called out that social hooks could have

01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:10.620
been better implemented uh but if you have a large library of rock band tracks hey you're gonna have

01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:16.220
a lot here for you so um that's pretty much all i have to say about it i spent a lot of hours on

01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:20.540
this game i really like this game i think it really stinks that we don't have a backwards

01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:24.940
compatible version of this game i wish they would release just the player for those of us that still

01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:29.580
have a large library of rock band tracks maybe take out the music i understand why it's one of

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:34.220
those things that's easier said than done i just you know i thought this game was great and i

01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:39.020
really would love to see harmonix visited again sometime even if i didn't love the amplitude

01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:43.900
reboot that came after this but that's another story so there it is your classic game of the

01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:51.500
week rock band blitz did you ever play rock band blitz loki uh i did when it first came out yeah

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:57.820
not very much yeah um i think i just downloaded because uh you know i played my full library of

01:43:57.820 --> 01:44:03.900
rock band songs and i had a ton of songs so it made sense yeah um was it the opposite too because

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:07.900
i know like with a lot of those games you can kind of move them between different games like i know

01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:12.860
with like rock band 2 you can import like yeah lego rock band and stuff like that all those songs

01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:18.540
and mike def points out you could also export the rock band blitz songs and play them in the real

01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:22.220
real rock band you know the main line i guess or whatever franchise that's what that's what

01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:27.580
was worth it for a lot of those like i remember was it um i think it was like a rock band that had

01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:32.940
uh like i had the tiger or something like that there was like one of those like i oh i got to

01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:38.060
get those songs it was like lego lego rock band had a yeah yeah yeah so like it was it was worth

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:42.460
like just purchasing the game because i think it was like super cheap at one point just to get the

01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:47.180
licensed songs so you can pull them in like regular rock bands so that's pretty cool all

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:53.340
right um we really just have a few more stories for you um i know that might seem kind of like

01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:58.700
a surprise but um a there wasn't quite as much gaming news this week with the labor day holiday

01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:03.900
and you know everything else going on and b i knew i probably wasn't gonna last a full three

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:08.140
hours tonight so we don't have quite as many stories slotted tonight um but i will encourage

01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:13.340

01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:26.220
a couple of days i did and i regretted it because i lost my voice but um i played with uh nick and

01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:34.860
a couple of times and uh played with gwen as finora and you took my place on a stream the

01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:41.180
other night well i didn't realize that you were already playing when i reached out before so

01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:48.060
yeah no it's and it's it's fine because i i i could i really i i wasn't quite over covid so

01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:52.860
i was really and i'm still not really but like it was one of those i could maybe do this for like 90

01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:57.100
minutes and then dinner was coming in anyway so it was like all right i'm leaving and then

01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:00.700
i left to go eat dinner when i came back i was like oh jamie took my place that's cute i love

01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:06.620
that so but it looks like you guys had fun i also had wanted to play with uh tay and black's again

01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:11.660
for a while oh yeah there's there's so much fun i love that group they are they are a trip to both

01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:17.500
of them yeah and they were increasingly drunk by the end of uh as is typical for friday night

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:26.700
streams yeah right um but man though the state of dbd right now is stinkier and stinkier and

01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:34.860
stinkier and west career and west career well it's it's just like the camping has gotten worse

01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:45.500
oh yeah it sure has no buena yeah um and um but i mean as far as like i still have a lot of fun

01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:51.980
but i have i'm waiting until rank reset to try wesker because i adopted ada and uh rebecca first

01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:59.340
day um i'm actually playing i played shiva today because she still had like uh like a couple of

01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:05.340
cakes and uh some stuff on her on well it's from it's from playing claire it's and she's quiet it's

01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:10.860
the it's i swear that this game right now is just resident evil meets dead by daylight like it's

01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:17.820
all resident evil which is but everybody like shiva everybody from resident evil is so hot

01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:27.020
i'm gonna go on record though and say i don't think carlos looks good his hair is a hot mess

01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:32.540
i don't know i kind of like a guy with messy hair well no i'm not saying it's messy i'm saying it's

01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:39.180
poorly rendered the same thing with all of the attack on titan most of the attack on titan hairs

01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:46.860
and also most of yui's my like her new ones my imagination fills in the uh

01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:56.780
imperfections my brain goes into design nerd stuff so um but uh but at any rate um i have

01:48:56.780 --> 01:49:01.100
been playing cult of the lamb uh that's like my monday thing and of course that'll be a

01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:07.100
a silent stream for me because i am i have been on an almost vow of silence

01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:17.260
and and unwillingly um so uh i get to uh participate in real life again by hopefully

01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:23.340

01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:29.500

01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:35.020

01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:30.060
bye uh let's get into some rapid fire news we just have a couple stories for you and we'll

01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:38.300
start with loki yep so uh this is kind of cool and uh basically you may remember there's been

01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:43.500
a few games that they've done this where they've reverse engineered hobbyists have reverse

01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:49.180
engineered a certain nintendo games not even necessarily just nintendo um because i remember

01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:53.980
they did that with the i think it was like vice city or something like that for playstation but

01:50:53.980 --> 01:51:01.500
anyways um so now they have reverse engineered the uh legend of zelda link to the past and they

01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:09.660
have ported it to pc so it's running natively on pc now uh this is thanks to a github user snes rev

01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:16.380
who has uh put together the code to do that now of course you have to have a legally obtained

01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:25.500
version of the rom available and then using some uh python scripts you can convert it into an

01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:32.460
executable for the pc uh it runs all right right now they don't it's like running but they don't

01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:38.860
have like all of you know the fancy features like you know upscaling or uh full screen remappable

01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:44.860
controls and that type of stuff yet but you know it's being worked on until it gets shut down by

01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:52.700
nintendo so go download it while you can all right i have one quick story for you also out

01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:58.700
of the d23 expo and that is that a new tron game is coming and you know this caught my attention

01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:04.460
right it is a game called tron identity but it might not be what you think because this game is

01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:09.420
apparently going to be more of a visual novel it's not going to feature anybody from the movies so

01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:13.500
it's just kind of set in the tron universe but i'm actually like totally okay with that i actually

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:17.100
like that idea of trying to establish things that are independent from the movies because i

01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:22.220
like the movies have been in development hell for you know we all have heard that there's that

01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:26.060
mysterious third movie they're talking about making that jared letto may or may not be involved

01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:35.100
with and i hope it's not um but regardless the the the tron um legacy was 2010 it's been 12 years

01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:38.540
since that movie so like if a sequel is going to happen you would hope it would happen sooner

01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:44.460
rather than later of course it took what 28 years the first time so oh so anyway i i like

01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:48.620
that disney is trying to establish some tron things that are outside of the movie universe

01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:53.260
so that maybe tron can continue and i'm still jazzed that they are opening a ride i think

01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:57.500
they showed test footage of the ride today uh i think they said it's going to be early next year

01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:05.500
i'd love to go to something like i was seeing uh because there's a few people on um on youtube that

01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:10.700
i follow that do like the park you know like the pov park ride stuff yeah someone was saying like

01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:16.300
the people movers are coming back because that's exciting news that is a huge rumor right now is

01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:21.100
that people movers are coming back yeah i hope so i love it yeah i would love to see that too

01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:27.980
but anyway uh tron identity is a game that is coming out um in 2023 and it is a visual novel

01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:32.940
and puzzle game it's being developed by mike befell who made thomas was alone so that's a

01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:38.220
pretty big resume item and the solitaire conspiracy uh in the game you will follow

01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:43.740
query a detective program that is keeping the peace on an all new grid query is tasked with

01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:51.020
unraveling a break-in and theft that occurred um you will advance the story by uh defragging other

01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:57.260
programs identity disk um so once you defrag the disk you get to the path that shows the solution

01:53:57.260 --> 01:54:03.500
for the unique puzzles uh it should be noted uh this is and what's interesting this article i'm

01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:11.180
looking at says that tron is the first disney uh tron game for pc or console since tron 2.0

01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:17.660
that is incorrect uh in 2004 there was a tron runner game that came out and i think that was

01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:24.540
the name of it was tron run run are yeah so um how about that way to get way to do your job

01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:30.380
gaming journalist uh no i'm just giving him shit there was that tron run our game that was out i

01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:37.180
want to say that was around 20 it was a few years after the movie i want to say that 2015 2016

01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:43.980
so it's it's been a little bit but yeah uh also um this is completely neglecting

01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:52.780
the tron legacy uh xbox 360 and p um maybe that one wasn't on pc but i think it was

01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:59.100
so they neglected that one too it was i think it was called just tron legacy but it was like

01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:05.580
a tie-in game that was on like the 360 and playstation 3 yeah that was more of a traditional

01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:11.820
adventure game so it's trying evolution try evolution thank you okay that's what it was

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:18.700

was that the uk and us that was uk and us all right let's go to japan and the big release this

01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:20.060
week in japan i think uh on the nintendo switch this week is dragon quest 10 offline so this was

01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:25.180
announced a little while ago where this is uh you know the version of dragon quest 10 uh where you

01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:29.980
don't have to pay to do an mmo anymore um i hope i hope this gets localized for the us because we

01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:35.020
never got to play dragon quest 10 in any capacity so we'll see uh a regular and deluxe edition are

01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:40.140
bound for japan on the 15th uh we also have on the switch fairy fencer f refrain cord comes out

01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:47.180
trinity trigger is also out and uh that is it for the switch if we go over to the playstation 5

01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:51.580
uh dragon quest 10 offline is also released on the playstation on the playstation 5

01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:56.380
uh fairy fencer f and trinity trigger also so i guess those are your big games but there's one

01:59:56.380 --> 02:00:03.340
more on the playstation 5 and that is japan's release of destroy all humans 2 the reprobed

02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:09.980
edition also in japan this week you can pick up a playstation 5 horizon forbidden west bundle uh

02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:17.660
that is out in a uh regular and uh the digital edition of ps5 so um that is the version of the

02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:24.140
that uh i guess just comes included with the game or so i guess the playstation itself doesn't look

02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:34.620
any different so okay yeah that's weird all right i'm trying to see if maybe there's like a subtle

02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:38.620
engraving or something on it because i when i saw it i assumed it was a limited release console but

02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:48.060
i guess not all righty then all right uh let's move on with a couple more stories loki yes so

02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:58.140
gamesop has been accused of wiretapping customers um and this is it's not as crazy as it sounds

02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:05.580
so basically what it is they are not complying with the california's invasion of privacy act

02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:13.180
which they can't basically website operators can't create transcripts of visitors conversations and

02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:20.780
this is happening in their support chat is what's happening um they're saying that apparently the

02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:27.020
company is uh taking secret transcripts of those wiretaps and they're sharing them with

02:01:27.020 --> 02:01:31.100
a third party that helps them boost its ability to harvest personal data

02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:41.980
but anyways so they do have a lawsuit though um that's basically saying that you know that

02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:46.380
compliance with sipa is easy and the vast majority of companies comply with the law

02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:50.700
by simply notifying website visitors if their conversations are being recorded

02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:55.260
so you know how you you know hear those messages whenever you call an 800 number or something like

02:01:55.260 --> 02:02:02.780
that that they're recorded for you know quality and training purposes which is which is you know

02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:08.460
because i did work in a call center for a very long time many years ago and they you know uh we

02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:13.260
would play the calls and training class absolutely that was something that we would do um to to learn

02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:19.900
from them and so forth um but also yeah calls get randomly audited that's how uh companies make sure

02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:23.500
because they i don't know how much i should say well i don't work there anymore and it's been a

02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:28.700
long time but but they they found out that um some of the people working were um hanging up on

02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:32.940
customers and they can only do that through the uh audit process so it's an important part to keep

02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:37.900
the integrity of what's going on in this case they're saying that the uh that game stop is

02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:44.380
allowing zendesk to intercept and use the transcripts from these well zendesk is apparently

02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:49.820
a like ticketing system so i don't know how malicious it is that they're doing that but

02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:54.700
at the very least they should probably be complying with the the sipa act um in order to

02:02:55.820 --> 02:03:01.900
you know not getting hot water for this stuff but you know it seems benign to me it's not like a

02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:06.940
like oh we're capturing all this data and we're selling it to you know advertisers and we're gonna

02:03:06.940 --> 02:03:14.300
figure it out no i think it's it seems a little litigious um but

02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:26.300
we'll see if anything comes of this i doubt it all right um let's move on into one more story for the

02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:34.140
night um and it's a sad one uh we lost uh a gaming great this last week i think this is

02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:40.460
actually the week we were out um but i'm gonna mention it anyway on august 30th uh the president

02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:47.580
of miracle kids uh mitsuhiro yoshida passed away suddenly uh although you may not be familiar with

02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:54.780
miracle kids with a z uh you would know mitsuhiro yoshida as uh one of the people uh that was on the

02:03:54.780 --> 02:04:02.700
team at uh technos japan who created the series like river city ransom super dodgeball and nintendo

02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:08.060
world cup these were all part of the kunio kun series and i believe there's even a compilation

02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:14.140
of like kunio kun games that came out just within the past couple years miracle kids was made up

02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:19.260
largely of former staff there and they even continued to produce titles in the kunio kun

02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:25.420
series most of these are now owned by arc system works um so uh in a statement that was posted to

02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:30.300
twitter uh mitsuhiro yoshida president of miracle kids and one of the key creative figures behind

02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:36.380
classic kunio kun titles including nes super dodgeball and river city ransom passed away on

02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:41.180
august 30th suddenly that's all they said was suddenly they didn't give any more details

02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:49.180
but still what a um what a terrible loss uh for the industry um unfortunately these stories of

02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:55.340
loss do not end there i would need to say something as well about um a very well-known

02:04:55.340 --> 02:05:00.780
video game journalist who also passed away while we were out um on this last week and that was mike

02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:06.380
fahey uh who is with kotaku oh wow and say which say what you oh you didn't hear about this no i

02:05:06.380 --> 02:05:11.900
haven't heard about oh well you've been very busy paying attention to other things um no mike fahey

02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:18.300
passed away um at 49 um he passed away on friday and uh you know he he was having some medical

02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:26.700
problems over the past couple years um so uh he uh had a aortic dissection in 2018 that is where

02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:31.820
the body kind of tear your main artery and it left him paralyzed and he was using a wheelchair

02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:36.940
he had another one of these tears in april and a subsequent infection unfortunately was the cause

02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:43.100
of death so it's a very very tragic um say what you will about kotaku over the years um and we've

02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:48.860
said plenty um but uh mike fahey definitely seemed like he was always one of the good guys and um

02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:54.060
you know i i there's not a lot i i did not have a lot of interactions with him so i can't say a lot

02:05:54.060 --> 02:06:00.940
however i know um our pal bobby blackwolf who we work with here at vog was also in the atlanta area

02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:06.540
where mike fahey was and has a lot more to say on his show this week and gives a much better tribute

02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:13.660
so i would encourage you to listen to that show but um obviously um you know gaming journalism

02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:20.140
of a certain area was absolutely in part shaped by mike fahey so that's a huge loss as well so

02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:24.940
um sjo and her matt wants to point out kotaku had a very nice write-up with stories from various

02:06:24.940 --> 02:06:29.340
people in the industry uh yeah i just saw that yeah dartesia says yeah i didn't know him but

02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:33.980
damn if i didn't see his articles on kotaku mike def says mike fahey was one of the few people at

02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:41.340
kotaku that was worth reading so um yeah so that's a very unfortunate uh loss as well in the industry

02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:48.220
this week so all right well with that i'm going to try to move into our listener roundtable and

02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:55.660
invite your calls over at the green room over at twitch.tv slash vog i'm sorry that's how to watch

it's been a minute i'm doing good you know i over you look good well i i try i try i i discovered

02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:39.180
something called the uh the rob roberts diet it's kind of similar to you know to to the richard

02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:43.660
simmons diet it's been kind of working it's been kind of helping you know oh actually so like more

02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:56.380
no it's good water's good and i i i love richard simmons i i take that as a an ultimate compliment

02:07:56.380 --> 02:08:01.580
he's an amazing human being i could i could do an entire three hour talk on how richard simmons is

02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:05.660
completely underappreciated and a gift we don't deserve but anyway i'll save that for another day

02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:09.260
what's on your mind you didn't call it to talk about richard simmons what do you want to talk

02:08:09.260 --> 02:08:13.980
about well things but before i continue i do want to say loki my deepest condolences

02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:17.500
i i understand what you're going through and we got you bro

02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:24.220
thank you you're welcome uh secondly i i kind of want to

02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:32.620
tag along to something what bobby black was said about uh game zone quick let's say for for the

02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:40.060
sake of it they they sent like a skeleton team to that to the venue just just just for the sake of

02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:46.700
it now upon top of the fact that the company will have to pay cancellation fees from the venue

02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:52.460
there's additional fees for the rooms because when you sometimes when you get these venues you got to

02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:59.260
promise that you're going to fill x amount of rooms and if you don't fill them you basically

02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:07.900
paying like like maybe up to 100 to 150 per room a con that i was violent told that that happened

02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:14.460
its first year and it was kind of surprising they were able to bounce back with a uh year two so

02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:21.420
that's i actually have known that from something else i'm working with on the side um that yeah

02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:26.540
they're yeah the room guarantees and all that to to get the rates and all that yep that is very

02:09:26.540 --> 02:09:31.580
true and that's something games done quick is going to have to figure out they're probably

02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:37.740
going to have to pay it uh and and uh figure it out from their uh list viewership and maybe have

02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:41.980
to have some fundraisers because you know they have they have their channel they run that channel

02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:47.740
most of the time and it's not always for charity so they might run their own kind of fundraisers

02:09:47.740 --> 02:09:52.940
to sort of you know fundraise to run the funds they like cover that stuff so they don't go

02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:56.780
bankrupt i'm sure people would be more than willing to jump in i'm sure they will i'm sure

02:09:56.780 --> 02:10:02.700
they will well that happened to magfest a couple of years back they they cancelled magfest paid

02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:08.220
off the cancellation fees and had a telethon made and made the money back yeah so i'm sure

02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:13.180
games done quick could do the same easy and and lastly there was something else but i totally

02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:18.060
forgot but that's just how my my memory is got the retention of a goldfish sometimes but um i

02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:22.300
kind of want to jump back to what you're talking about dragon con and the conventions and so forth

02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:28.060
you know there are times when i have to deal with people like that in my own circles i just

02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:35.980
want to just shake them if not shake them slap some sense into them what people don't understand

02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:42.460
is that if a con cancels they got to pay all these fees out and sometimes they don't have

02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:49.580
to depending on you know the local ordinances about covet and so forth and once we get past that

02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:54.460
you have cons are like okay we're gonna do our thing but you gotta follow these rules you have

02:10:54.460 --> 02:11:02.620
to mask up and all this and so forth and there are people that will push back and i remember

02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:07.020
one of my favorite conventions i was actually getting into a pissing fight with somebody over

02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:12.700
this and the people that run the convention messaged me begging me to stop and walk away

02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:18.940
this one person was demanding that the con go on she didn't care about wearing a mask because she

02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:25.820
said she was dying anyway she just wanted to have a good time and i'm just like who hurt you

02:11:26.780 --> 02:11:33.340
you know that's and that's why that's why i don't fault dragon con or any con for what happened

02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:38.700
number one i knew what situation i was working walking into number two my understanding is they

02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:42.940
tried and what happened is that people were basically fighting with them those are the people

02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:51.500
that i blame like but rob let me say this you didn't walk into anything you went in full well

02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:56.780
knowing what was going on and you followed the protocols so that's what you did that was that's

02:11:56.780 --> 02:12:04.060
perfectly fine indeed you do that not just for personal when you go out you do this for work i

02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:10.620
mean they just said on the subways you do not have to wear a mask oh i saw that yeah i wear a

02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:15.980
mask because you know what i don't trust half these people out here i'm just like no no i know

02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:25.020
people who have caught covid like three four times and it freaks me out i'm just saying i've been a

02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:32.220
lot i rode it i rode the atlanta subway on tuesday while i was apparently now now that i know i'm

02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:38.380
such a while i was contagious those folks should be thanking me for wearing a mask honestly so

02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:42.780
no i don't i don't need a medal or a treat i had to do what i had to do to get home

02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:46.380
but you know it's just kind of one of those like it's not hard to wear a mask

02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:51.980
it's common sense and as i said before covid one of those things that actually scares me because

02:12:51.980 --> 02:12:57.740
i have actually known people who are on the brink of death and just bounced back from it and i'm

02:12:57.740 --> 02:13:06.860
just like you know and next weekend i'm going to a con with somebody she cannot be vaccinated

02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:12.540
due to her medical condition and i got masks and everything and i'm just like

02:13:12.540 --> 02:13:17.900
and i'm just hoping that she's she'll be fine through this and she's already survived a round

02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:26.700
of covid so um that is uh yeah but it's interesting so you but you saying she's going to the con

02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:30.540
anyway and i think there would be a lot of people out there that would like to tell her

02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:38.380
don't do it but you know it's it's her decision it's her decision not yours and that's that's

02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:43.420
that's what was making me angry earlier right but the thing is she'll be wearing a mask so there's

02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:48.380
that now it'd be a different story like there are some conventions that are like they they're

02:13:48.380 --> 02:13:53.340
there are some cons where it's like you must have your your shots you must have your booster

02:13:53.340 --> 02:14:00.700
and you must show proof of a negative test like 24 hours before the con you know and there are

02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:05.580
people that argue that and yes there are those conventions that have that restrictive rules

02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:11.900
it still happens but i always argue just wait just wait so everything is said and done you

02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:17.820
count the numbers because of how strict they were the numbers on that's going to be very low and

02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:23.500
and that's all that really matters i mean hell i went to a con a year and a half ago and i refused

02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:31.500
to support them because they had a covid scare they they actually put that someone may have

02:14:31.500 --> 02:14:38.300
tested positive and an email blast they sent out congratulating the winners of a raffle they put

02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:43.740
that at the bottom and then i found out the next day they posted on their social medias

02:14:43.900 --> 02:14:53.660
i i was just absolutely freaked yes it was a thin chance i caught it but it's just how they handled

02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:59.100
the situation and then i found that one of my friends who's a voice actor in the industry

02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:05.580
was a guest at that con and they never told him oh wow so that's yeah and i know i know i know

02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:09.340
you were saying that like the convention sort of you know had a responsibility to tell people and

02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:14.300
so forth i i also have to say that rama like i i don't necessarily disagree like at least

02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:17.820
it would have been in their best interest to at least put out a tweet that said hey we had

02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:22.540
a lot of people here this weekend you know you should follow these you know covid things for

02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:25.660
safety or you should get a test and know your status or whatever like that would have been

02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:31.420
really nice i think it would be a good thing however there it it's also necessary to put

02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:36.460
some fucking accountability on the attendees you went to a convention that was intended by thousands

02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:43.740
and thousands of people if you don't think you were exposed to covid i i i don't i don't know

02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:49.660
there are some common sense things i don't know how to explain to people but also there's a

02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:56.220
financial aspect of it like some of the hotels don't want to push back because these people will

02:15:56.220 --> 02:16:02.300
cancel their rooms and that's less money coming in that weekend and given how the economy is you know

02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:08.460
you gotta take take the hits where you can without being knocked out which i do understand to a

02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:15.420
certain extent i'm one of those it's like if that if i'm running the place if that means y'all don't

02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:22.060
show up and i lose their type of money that's fine the liability has dropped a lot at the end

02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:26.940
of the day i will count my blessings count the money and see if we can do something next year

02:16:26.940 --> 02:16:31.340
or if i'm running the hotel see we see if we can continue to keep the people on staff to keep the

02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:38.300
hotel open you know i i'm sorry there no you're not wrong but there is an important element of

02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:44.460
dragon con you have to remember um with those hotels and that is that there is a lot going on

02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:50.860
in atlanta on labor day and even though i can't imagine being in that hotel and not being at

02:16:50.860 --> 02:16:56.140
dragon con there are people that go to those hotels that are staying there for the football

02:16:56.140 --> 02:17:01.180
games that are happening in town this weekend and guess who the crowd is that doesn't want to

02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:04.300
wear the fucking mask around the hotel and the hotel doesn't want to be the bad guy

02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:13.500
there have been times where odor con has happened and right across from the bc i mean from the

02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:19.020
convention center you you have a bunt you have camden yards so they're so those people are coming

02:17:19.020 --> 02:17:25.500
out seeing us running around in fabrics are like who are those freaks mind you we see them wearing

02:17:25.500 --> 02:17:30.220
sports attire and they're painted up and we're like who are those weirdos you know

02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:40.860
well i'm just glad things are starting to get better not at the rate that it should be but

02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:46.700
at least we're getting somewhere you know at least the the evolutions of the virus seem to

02:17:46.700 --> 02:17:50.940
be getting weaker and that's you know we just have to hope it keeps going in that direction

02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:56.300
like i said earlier this last week has not been pleasant do not let me try to make it sound like

02:17:56.380 --> 02:18:01.500
covid was a pleasant experience the second time or into that stuff no it sucked you do not want this

02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:07.900
however swine flu was worse like i said that was i was worse i was i i remember one night when i

02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:15.340
had swine flu i was like this is it this is the end that i mean i i laugh now but it wasn't funny

02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:23.580
then so uh i i i i it hasn't been as bad as that but ev your mileage may vary look i got a friend

02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:29.260
who caught covid back in december it's been nine months she still has a lingering cough so

02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:34.620
yeah to i'll say this and i'm gonna get out of here for the night because i gotta prep for work

02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:41.340
tomorrow and all that to paraphrase chris frock you know i don't one day we get to the point where

02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:45.100
you've heard to your friend you're like how are you doing that man i don't know man yeah i'm all

02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:49.340
right yo my cove has been acting up but i tell you what i took some testing last night and i'm feeling

02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:55.180
great you know i hope we eventually get to that point where you know a little bit of tussle noodle

02:18:56.460 --> 02:19:03.740
or something to put long covid in check right yeah yeah so all right take care of my friend

02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:07.420
thank you for calling it's always good to hear from you no problem y'all take care and see you

02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:13.100
on the flip side all right bye-bye anime jam session listen to it all right uh if you want

02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:17.740
to give us a call vog network.com and you can join the green room and uh we'll get to that

02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:24.140
vognetwork.com discord that is um i didn't check with loki to see if there's any last minute stories

02:19:24.780 --> 02:19:31.980
uh yes there was there was a leak apparently um for blizzard's new overwatch 2 hero

02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:39.820
uh kuriko i guess it was going to be a support character got accidentally leaked it is mentioned

02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:48.460
in the season one premium battle pass um documented or it's like the description for that

02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:52.220
which i don't know if they they've pulled that down or not but they actually have like

02:19:52.220 --> 02:20:01.180
i think video or screenshots of the hero uh who has cat ears so um

02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:07.100
yeah they're not too happy about that she's gonna be a support character i think i don't

02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:09.740
remember oh she's a teleporting fox girl

02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:17.260
sorry i just realized i was muted while i was typing um that sounds like it could be fun

02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:24.300
ever everybody loves a cat girl and a fox girl right of course yeah they said it was uploaded

02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:29.500
to a spanish um or uploaded in spanish it was an animated short for the character

02:20:30.060 --> 02:20:35.740
and it said with a still in progress render like tag on it so i'm

02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:42.380
i probably shouldn't have been leaked out probably not um but hey it could be like street fighter

02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:48.460
six and your entire roster could have already been leaked so there is that yeah things things

02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:52.940
could always be a little worse right it'd be worse yeah all right um i want to see if we have any

02:20:52.940 --> 02:20:56.220
tweets i know there was at least one i wanted to read because there was a follow-up to something

02:20:56.220 --> 02:20:59.820
that had come up on a prior episode so i'm looking at twitter right now if you want to

02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:04.140
follow us on twitter we actually we are lucky enough to have a three letter name it's o-l-r

02:21:04.140 --> 02:21:09.980
on twitter you can't even get that anymore o-l-r uh and if you want to follow us uh on twitter you

02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:15.420
sure can and you can send us tweets throughout the week uh such as a tweet that we got from

02:21:17.980 --> 02:21:23.580
uh i'm having to scroll through some comments that i made on the marvel game ah here it is um

02:21:24.220 --> 02:21:32.220
zeba uh had tweeted saying here is the vod of cirque's production of clue in final fantasy 14

02:21:32.220 --> 02:21:37.100
they had some technical difficulties and the audio didn't record so they manually put in the

02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:43.900
soundtrack there's no in-game sounds it's a bit weird but it's still great so that was a tweet uh

02:21:43.900 --> 02:21:49.820
from zeba uh who who sent us that and i actually did so it was uh them doing clue and it was the

02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:58.380
movie uh they did it in uh final fantasy 14 and it was pretty um it was pretty neat but

02:21:58.380 --> 02:22:03.420
you could see where the technical limitations kind of unfortunately got in the way a little bit

02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:09.660
because um they like like characters would pop in and out because there were too many people

02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:14.780
that were in the zone and so they weren't able yeah it's so so like characters would kind of

02:22:14.780 --> 02:22:18.060
like come and go and stuff like that i'm actually trying to see if i can bring it up here on the

02:22:18.060 --> 02:22:23.820
other monitor uh for you all oops you don't necessarily need to have the full music from

02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:28.940
the theme but there you go if you've never heard the music from clue let me see actually i really

02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:32.700
want to kill that because that's probably copyright music sorry about that uh let me

02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:36.060
go to the other screen here you can actually see so here's the production let me make that

02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:41.340
filled to the page there so you could see there is and so you can kind of see how it starts but

02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:45.820
then when you really get into like what's happening throughout the event like look at

02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:49.820
like all of these people here and whoever's recording this has to get like right up next

02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:57.660
to the dinner table to see what's going on and then in other places i want to do the scenes where

02:22:57.660 --> 02:23:02.060
it's really cutting in and out i think that was right maybe more towards the beginning like you

02:23:02.060 --> 02:23:05.820
could just see how many people are in there and it's kind of hard to see like well who's the

02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:09.740
character speaking and what what's happening and characters kind of pop in and out really fast

02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:15.660
but i loved if you actually read like what's going on with the script they actually

02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:21.020
localized things to fit aorza and the final fantasy universe and i thought it was super

02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:25.580
cute like what they were doing with that so it was clever and my honest suggestion would be

02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:32.700
do a performance of this just for the vod like i i know that it's very attractive to do this in

02:23:32.700 --> 02:23:37.900
game and get people to the house and all this type of stuff but do a performance for the vod

02:23:37.900 --> 02:23:42.220
like you know and that whole thing and and really show off you know the talent that goes into it

02:23:42.220 --> 02:23:46.380
without the technical problems of having people you know show up and stuff and some comments from

02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:51.180
chat so as joan hunter matt says dinner theater fantasy style and dr cio says wow that's great

02:23:51.180 --> 02:23:56.380
yeah like it's it's really clever and cool and unique and this is one of the those spontaneous

02:23:56.380 --> 02:24:02.220
things that happens to mmos that i love um but just some of the technical issues of the game

02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:08.300
aren't really prepared for it and that's a bummer all right well with that that was it for the

02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:13.420
tweets tonight and we did not get any emails that participate at orangeslaunchradio.com

02:24:13.420 --> 02:24:16.940
but i will invite you to send some for next week so again that's participate at

02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:21.420
orangeslaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email i think that's going to do it for the show

02:24:21.420 --> 02:24:26.860
my voice is about done with tonight as well so i think we're going to wrap up uh but let's go

02:24:26.860 --> 02:24:31.020
around and get uh final thoughts and stuff uh before that i will say thank you as always for

02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:36.620
listening to orange launch radio um if you enjoyed what you heard here please tell a friend about

02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:40.460
the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice and

02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:45.900
in order to get those voices out on air we need more people here a nice five-star review on a

02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:51.260
site like itunes spotify or wherever you found this podcast that all goes an awful long way

02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:56.620
super appreciate that before i get to my final thought i have to make sure we say this at some

02:24:56.620 --> 02:25:02.540
point as well i know we've had a lot of um bummer news tonight and things in our lives that we're

02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:09.260
dealing with and so forth but on a somewhat more positive note i should note the date is september

02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:16.300
11th and no i'm not referring to historical events uh in a in a winsmick way that would be tacky i

02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:22.540
am referring to the fact that september 11th happens to be loki's birthday it does happy

02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:27.820
birthday loki thank you did you get to do anything for your day in spite of everything

02:25:33.580 --> 02:25:38.460

02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:11.900
my own this week you know i usually leave dragon con so motivated to stream again from all the

02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:16.380
panels and things that i did so it really sucks that covet kind of put the brakes on that um

02:27:16.380 --> 02:27:20.700
because i would have been right back into it this week but it didn't happen but i am hoping i'm

02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:23.820
getting better enough especially from doing this show tonight and hopefully that continues tomorrow

02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:30.300
although my number one onus right now needs to be taken care of alan and making sure he has all his

02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:35.820
needs net but assuming that is all taken care of i will stream tomorrow i want to make sure i i do

02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:38.940
that and kind of get back in the habit of that i have no idea what i'm going to play yet but i'll

02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:45.980
play something um so yeah oh really quick quick i did want to mention since we didn't recover before

02:27:45.980 --> 02:27:51.420
for the live folks who are watching on twitch the game behind me is called one dreamer is a game

02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:59.420
that came out uh this week and it's like a i think it's a point click adventure game sort of where

02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:05.100
you do coding in it as well i played the the demo a while back and it was pretty awesome i i'm

02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:09.580
hoping to get a chance to play this the full game but apparently i think it was made by a single

02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:16.300
person over the course of seven years so it's just it's about kind of i haven't played it all

02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:20.140
the way but i think it's supposed to be about and it's probably going to ring true to a little bit

02:28:20.140 --> 02:28:28.380
to me um about like indie game devs and like these projects that they kind of set aside for a long

02:28:28.380 --> 02:28:34.940
time and going back to like finish them some type of things so i think that that's some of it but

02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:39.980
yeah it's pretty cool you should go check it out sounds like it might hit close to home all right

02:28:39.980 --> 02:28:42.940
that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio we'll be back in seven

02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:46.780
