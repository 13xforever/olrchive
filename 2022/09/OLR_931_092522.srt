00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,800
This week's axiom is Cunningham's Law, which states,

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,200
The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,600
to post the wrong answer.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,760
This was proven true again by game developers aplenty proving a foolhardy tweet wrong that

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,180
quote unquote confirmed that Grand Theft Auto 6 will look bad.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,800
Too bad the game isn't done yet.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,520
This is the lightest update on the latest AAA gaming bombshell.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,680
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,600
this story and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,480
every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,920
Hello my friends out there on the Internet and welcome back to another week of the show

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,360
where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,780
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,400
We are live once again with episode number 931.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
That's a lot of shows.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,460
For tonight, September 25th of 2022.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,060
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as always by my co-hosts.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,780
Say hello first off to, she's working on her TwitchCon cosplay here.

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,920
I would say the last minute but it isn't because there's still two weeks.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:19,660
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers who's, who's, oh, sorry, your noise gate is unforgiving

21
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,660
sometimes.

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,660
Sorry.

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,660
How are you?

24
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,660
I'm doing all right.

25
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,100
I am recovering from a migraine and, sorry.

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,140
Oh, it happens, you know, but I have crackle paste.

27
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:39,340
I ruined the last mask I was working on so I emergency ordered another one.

28
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:48,260
And my foam crafting is also not going to plan so I am putting crackle paste on this

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,620
mask to make the Phantom of the Opera.

30
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,440
No, that would be a half mask anyway.

31
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:03,520
I am doing the Rift cosmetic for the pig, at least the, the crown, the reverse bear

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,240
trap crown with her jigsaw mask and I realized that it would be a lot easier and a lot more

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,520
authentic looking if I just use crackle paste and instead of painting.

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,560
I would hope that if you are going to cosplay at TwitchCon, you're doing something related

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,120
to Dead by Daylight since it is the game that really, it took you, you and Twitch's

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,760
relationship to the next level.

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,580
I would say the Dead by Daylight community.

38
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,720
You remember I had been streaming and then kind of got bullied off.

39
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,080
Yeah, which stinks, but then you found a pretty accepting community.

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:52,040
So I did and funny enough, I made a friend at the Jiffy Lube who plays Dead by Daylight.

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,400
He and his lady friend do and so I may have new friends to play with.

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
That's awesome.

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,960
I know it seems like unfortunately, because my schedule, whatever, we never seem to be

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,680
able to connect to play Dead by Daylight on stream, but I hope we can soon, so it'll be

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
fun.

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,840
I play with Phonara quite a bit, but you know, and I always enjoy playing with Phonara, but

47
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,880
I like to expand a little bit and play, you know, give my other friends a chance to enjoy

48
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
my presence.

49
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
Sure, sure.

50
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,560
I mean, humbly speaking, of course.

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,400
We have over in chat over at twitch.tv slash a vog network because we do tape live every

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,320
Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Wolf show.

54
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,480
SSJ 100 Matt is wishing you happy Jewish New Year in chat, which I know we were talking

55
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,560
about just before the show.

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
So.

57
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Thank you.

58
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,620
Thank you for being here tonight in spite of that going on.

59
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,900
Can you believe the TwitchCon is just in two weeks?

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,700
Like I was just, you know, kind of thinking about that sales like, oh, my gosh, like,

61
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,700
I'm not ready.

62
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,420
Well, I feel like DragonCon just happened.

63
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,780
And certainly a lot of that was the coat was it did, but it was also the COVID sandbag

64
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,860
that took me out of real life for a couple of weeks.

65
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,540
And now now that things are getting up and going again, I'm like, oh, Snapple, there's

66
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,260
TwitchCon coming up in two weeks.

67
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,620
And did you get the email, by the way, that they're sending out with about your vaccination

68
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,620
and all of that?

69
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,620
Yes.

70
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,620
Everything is up today.

71
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,020
I'm getting this shit everywhere.

72
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,340
I signed up for the clear.

73
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,520
So they're using that clear service, which is you starting to see in more and more airports.

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,580
This is not an endorsement.

75
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,580
I've never used it.

76
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,580
I just see it all the time.

77
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,820
I didn't know they did COVID health pass stuff.

78
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,100
But apparently you can do that as well to I don't know if it's cut the line or skip

79
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,000
the line or just maybe it's like TSA pre-check, you have a shorter line.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,720
So I did all that stuff today because you have to take a bunch of pictures and send

81
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
that all over.

82
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,520
I could do that.

83
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:55,540
You actually remind me that I need to update my record because I just had the newest booster.

84
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,360
And everyone, unless you have a medically mandated reason that you cannot physically

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,360
take the booster, I don't want to hear your excuse.

86
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,440
I don't want to hear it.

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
I want to get it.

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,520
I'm just trying to figure out the right time to do it.

89
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,200
So you're quoting religion to do it.

90
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:19,600
Don't you think that your deity of choice would want you to be healthy so that you can

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,400
continue to contribute to said faith?

92
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Yeah, just trust all of us that have had COVID.

93
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
You don't want it.

94
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,800
And I'm sure at this point, I imagine more of our listeners have had it than haven't.

95
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,900
And we can also tell you that as well.

96
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,300
So anyway, I am, by the way, going to step away for a moment because this was the poorly

97
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,300
thought out idea.

98
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
You're fine.

99
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Because I also have to introduce Techmaster Loki.

100
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Hi, Loki.

101
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Hello.

102
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,300
Hi.

103
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
How are you?

104
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm doing fine.

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,820
So I notice you do have a game that plays behind you every week as we are broadcasting

106
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,820
live here on Twitch.

107
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,800
I know the podcast listeners can't see it, but I will tell them I easily know that game

108
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,900
because that is the game that I would call the it girl game of Twitch right now.

109
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,460
Because usually there's some games that will be like the it girl of Twitch for a couple

110
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,460
of weeks.

111
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,300
And I would say the last one, maybe still a little bit, was Cult of the Lamb, was very

112
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,300
much the it girl on Twitch.

113
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,800
Maybe before that, I'm trying to think of some of the other it girl games that kind

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
of like came and went.

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,180
Well, Disney, Dreamlight Valley, it seems like a lot of people are doing, but anyway.

116
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,180
Still the it girl.

117
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,940
You have, you are playing trombone champ.

118
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,100
I keep wanting to say trombone hero, but that isn't it.

119
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,540
It's trombone champ is actual name of it.

120
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,680
We don't want to be copyright.

121
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,040
They don't want to be in legal trouble with Activision.

122
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Yes.

123
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,360
And I noticed the thing about trombone champ that's interesting is that most of the music,

124
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,880
if not all of it, is either like public domain or some sort of, you know, song that is in

125
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,640
the public consciousness where they can easily put it into the game.

126
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,080
Like there's a lot of classic songs like Beethoven, Bach, and then there's things like, you know,

127
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,840
I think Hava Nagila is one of the songs where it's things where it's like they're public

128
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
domain songs.

129
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
That's a hard one.

130
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Yeah.

131
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Yeah.

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,120
So, you know, we're longtime music game fans, and I'm sure you want to talk a little more

133
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,200
about this game during your gaming week, but what do you think it is about this game that

134
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,280
is making it the girl of Twitch right now?

135
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,920
It's not taking itself seriously.

136
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,660
For one, it's really strange.

137
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,880
It's a strange game.

138
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:31,800
It's kind of almost got all that, like, like it's like weird elements to it, kind of like

139
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,840
cookie clicker almost, you know, where it has like, it's like, oh, it's a game about

140
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
cookies.

141
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Wait, now there's Eldritch demons.

142
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
What?

143
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Yeah.

144
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,920
It's like weird stuff like that.

145
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,640
So this one, it's, it's, it's, you know, it's a trombone game with a character.

146
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,320
It looks like it could be a me.

147
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:55,880
And then there's also tons of baboons and the chaotic demon and it's like Dark Souls

148
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
is weird.

149
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,040
It's frog fractions, but it's trombones basically.

150
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Kinda, not kinda, by the way, if you've never experienced the genius that is frog fractions,

151
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,640
I don't even know if the game is still up and running somewhere, but it's, I think it's,

152
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
it's on steam.

153
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
I think.

154
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Oh wait.

155
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Oh, that's right.

156
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
I think they did release on Steve.

157
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,000
So it's really one of the most incredible gaming experiences you'll ever experience

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,280
is frog fractions.

159
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
There was a sequel.

160
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,120
I sort of think at that point when you knew what the gag was, I think the sequel kind

161
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,920
of lost effectiveness, but, uh, it's, it's, it's still worth the time was that you didn't

162
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,760
know it was frog fractions too, because it was a different game.

163
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Yes.

164
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,920
And that was the running gag on this show for many shows for a long time was, Oh, this

165
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,040
new weird thing.

166
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,880
Is this frog fractions too?

167
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,240
Is it, is trombone champ frogs fractions too?

168
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,880
No, it's, it's a, it's a fun yet challenging game.

169
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
That's for sure.

170
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,960
This isn't the first I've heard of it.

171
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,440
Oh, it's, you know what the, you know, the funny thing about it.

172
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Okay.

173
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,880
So as a music game fan, the actual music game itself, this is literally theater them.

174
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,880
There's three different stage types and theater them.

175
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,560
It's not the one you see the most, but I believe this is the cut scene one where you're just

176
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,160
going up and down and tracing the note it's theater them, but it's theater them with the

177
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,520
trombone and the it's the sense of humor that makes it so that like when you miss notes,

178
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,360
it says nasty.

179
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,720
And when you, Oh, it's the battle stages says Mike Deft.

180
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,080
I thought, no, that those are the ones you commonly see.

181
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,700
This is the one, I think it's the cut scene ones, the movie stages where you are tracing

182
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,360
the note lines and everything.

183
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,120
It's really, it's the same mechanic.

184
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,240
It's just going the opposite direction, which I guess the default mode for the trombone

185
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,000
is also down as up and up as down.

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Right.

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Because that's the way trombone would work.

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah.

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,680
No, I fixed that right away.

190
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
But it's just, if you listen to it.

191
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
What about valve trombone?

192
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,320
I don't think they add any of the other mechanics and that, yeah.

193
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,600
But it's the, it's the noise that the trombone makes.

194
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,680
That's really funny when you're messing up and that's what, and the fact that they call

195
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,000
them tromboners, when you play a trombone, you're a tromboner, which isn't actually what

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,200
they're called, but it's, that's part, part, part of the humor in the game.

197
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
That's what we called them in high school.

198
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,760
I feel like the people that made this game absolutely were band nerds in the trombone

199
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
section.

200
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Like the, and these are all in jokes.

201
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,360
It's hilarious though, is they have like trading cards you can unlock and like booster packs

202
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
and stuff like that.

203
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,420
But they're like of like classic trombone musicians was like, who's collecting that.

204
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,900
But it's just ridiculous.

205
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,020
So which Neville brother is in there?

206
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,380
Well, I was just, I hope you, you cannot have a ska band without a trombone.

207
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,760
Like a trombone is an essential part of any ska band.

208
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,620
So I think they do have a ska track in there.

209
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,780
I'm pretty sure there is.

210
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,620
There's also, was it that, that, that track from, um, 2001, a space odyssey?

211
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Oh yeah.

212
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,620
Oh yeah.

213
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Well, that's a classic.

214
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,620
Zarathustra.

215
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
That's a classic.

216
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
Yeah.

217
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,900
For the record, here's a true story about me as a band nerd.

218
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:05,660
I wanted to play trombone and, uh, I wasn't allowed to play trombone because apparently

219
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,300
I don't have the correct shaped mouth to play trombone.

220
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,820
So I played saxophone instead.

221
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,820
Hmm.

222
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,940
Well, I think if they make a sequel to this game, it won't be saxophone champ.

223
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,340
It'll be tuba champ.

224
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,540
It seems likely the likely sequel to this game.

225
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,620
Well, and the other thing, I still want a sax master.

226
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,500
And the other thing I want to say, and then I want to get into the news and stuff is that

227
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,100
with this game, uh, you know, I keep saying it's the girl on Twitch because it went extremely

228
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,540
viral on Twitter.

229
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,140
And I was very surprised that the people that were tweeting this, like all these verified

230
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,780
accounts, including like one of the MSNBC news anchors, like quote, tweeted it and said,

231
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,940
this is the laugh I needed today or something like that.

232
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,060
Like just the little clip of people playing the trombone horribly, I think speaks to all

233
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,180
of us that have ever joined bands successfully or otherwise.

234
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,700
So I think it does.

235
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,660
It does sound like a high school marching band, like practicing music that they are

236
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,860
not familiar with is what it sounds like.

237
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,540
Can you play it with a trombone MIDI controller?

238
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:12,820
No, no, because that it's, it's, I don't think it's, it's not supposed to be serious, Jamie.

239
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
It's a jokey kind of thing.

240
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,140
So, but it shouldn't put like, like a support in there just to be hilarious because I think

241
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,140
it would have been funny.

242
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,540
And actually it's what the modding community's for.

243
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,740
And Bobby said, so Bobby just said it in chat, not yet, but somebody's already modding it

244
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,980
in the MIDI controller because of course they are.

245
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,540
And they've already modded in other songs.

246
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,540
I'm sure.

247
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,980
I think I heard you were talking about a megalovania or whatever that song is from megalovania

248
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,460
shows up in everything, but I was thinking like, how about some early, no doubt songs

249
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,260
like back when they really were scar or some of the other like stuff from the nineties,

250
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,700
you know, boss tones, there's any pain fans.

251
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,900
I introduced you to pain a long time ago.

252
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,340
Are they even still together?

253
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,340
No.

254
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:00,220
Um, Everest, they have another band that's formed since then, but like pose got like

255
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,940
tenure at Georgia tech.

256
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,220
And so the band kind of fell apart and now it's like a different band, but still pain

257
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,420
is like one of the best bands to ever come out of the South.

258
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
All right.

259
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,420
All right.

260
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,240
Maybe they'll show up in the DLC because, Hey, this game's going to make these, these

261
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
folks money.

262
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,880
So maybe they'll be able to put some money down for DLC.

263
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
We'll see.

264
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
We'll see.

265
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
All right.

266
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Anyhow, let's move on.

267
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

268
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,160
We actually have a lot of like Twitch related topics tonight.

269
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,200
I know it's interesting because Jamie and I are talking about Twitch con in a couple

270
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
of weeks.

271
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,880
Um, which, which will be the first time I've been in a long time.

272
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:42,280
Um, I went the very first year, you may or may not recall, um, our voiceover guy, Jason

273
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
took me the first year.

274
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,120
Um, and it was, uh, at the Moscone center and we only, I only went for a day.

275
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,440
Um, but that was where, you know, I, I learned a lot just walking around the show floor and

276
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,880
talking to vendors and it really was motivating to like do Twitch.

277
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,240
Um, I didn't quite stay on the wagon for a variety of reasons, but you know, a few years

278
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,020
later when the necessity of VOG, the going through changes and shout cast and all that

279
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,240
stuff, uh, kind of came up and we made the move to Twitch.

280
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,600
You know, it was, it was, I was very thankful.

281
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,480
I had experimented with Twitch before and kind of had some of that knowledge.

282
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,760
In fact, the video capture card that is still in my PC, this new PC, this day I bought

283
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,720
at that first Twitch con when I was there.

284
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,980
So it'd be interesting to see how it's evolved all these years later.

285
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,840
And now that I am a little more immersed in Twitch culture, not just through OLR, but

286
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,880
you know, through my own streaming and participation as well as dark soccer, it'll just be interesting

287
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,320
to see, you know, what this year looks like even just post pandemic, you know, so, well,

288
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,640
Well, I shouldn't say post pandemic, post lockdowns we'll say.

289
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:53,440
For the record, I actually have included my mask in with, uh, my, uh, what I'm calling

290
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:03,520
my casual cosplay, where I have a little lower face mask that's a pig going.

291
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:10,940
So if I need to, um, I have, I have my little pig, pig who half mask, but I'm going to make

292
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,900
this, I'm going to make my cosmetic work.

293
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,900
All right.

294
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,100
Well, we'll do more, uh, Twitch con prep next week and, and try to figure out where people

295
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,760
can find us and all that good stuff.

296
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,020
So there's a variety of meetups going on, uh, throughout the, uh, con.

297
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,420
So I'd love to meet some listeners if you're going to be there.

298
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,060
Otherwise, there's a lot of streamers that I watch that I can't wait to hang out with

299
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
and see.

300
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,060
So, uh, it's going to be fun.

301
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,060
My friends.

302
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,060
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

303
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,060
It's gonna be fun.

304
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,060
Yeah.

305
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:42,500
And, and if any, by the way, if, if any of the friends are listening, um, I'm going to

306
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,460
be at Disneyland on the 10th and you're welcome to hang out with me.

307
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,580
I will not be going sadly, nothing, nothing.

308
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,840
I just, we, we booked a flight home on Monday and I can't miss too much work because we're

309
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,100
also going to, don't forget, we're going to Seattle just like four more weeks.

310
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,520
So it's, you know, I had reserved the time off before my schedule even changed just to

311
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,660
be sure that I got it.

312
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,780
And I'm very glad that I did because the days I scheduled off for the days, my schedule

313
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,780
changed too.

314
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,780
Nice.

315
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,780
All right, let's move on.

316
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,700
We got other stuff in gaming we want to get to Mike.

317
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:20,300
We want to get tonight's kickoff topic, uh, which has to do, it's a little bit with Twitch

318
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,700
culture, but I'd say this is more about the game in question, which has not been getting

319
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:30,220
a lot of great reviews, uh, across the board, but continues to sell like hotcakes.

320
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,740
Anyway, Loki, why don't you start us off here?

321
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,580
I mean, it's not a surprise.

322
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,580
It's the same old complaints over and over again.

323
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:41,300
It's just, it's like EA is playing this game of how far can we push it before?

324
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,180
It's too much.

325
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:49,980
And maybe, maybe this time it was too much, but, um, so of course Madden players are upset

326
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:58,660
over the fact that, um, in game gambling nods of the ultimate team stuff is, um, basically,

327
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,540
I don't know if it's, um, that they don't have them in post yet.

328
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,260
Basically it says, uh, you know, they need better odds, uh, better re-rolls better pack

329
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,380
odds overall with bundles plus toppers, a hundred dollar version of promo bundles should

330
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:19,100
be enough to complete a master full legend solos reward with B and D champion fantasy

331
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:25,460
packs, at least top set pieces that can be added into sets to help NMS players.

332
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,260
Um, I wouldn't be spending a hundred dollars on these packs, but whatever.

333
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,940
Uh, so basically they're, the odds are getting harder to get, I guess, good players in those

334
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,020
all the team things.

335
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,260
So what they're doing now is announcing that they're going on pack strike, which makes

336
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,600
sense because a lot of these streams, a lot of them are opening these ultimate team packs.

337
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,480
And I mean, if you're getting like pretty bad polls, and I guess that also would impact

338
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,320
your, your content negatively as well, but you're also paying the money, which is kind

339
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,600
of perpetuating this problem in the first place.

340
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,720
So kind of your fault.

341
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,560
I mean, yeah, I was gonna say, look at Diablo immortal, like so many people were upset about

342
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,640
the, you know, um, microtransaction or whatever you want to call it system in that game.

343
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,060
Um, but because in part of all of these streamers buying into it anyway, and continuing to,

344
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,680
you know, we had all these stories when that game was first out about thousands of dollars

345
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,480
being poured into it and just encouraging others to do the same, that game is easily

346
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,780
in the top 10 grossing mobile games.

347
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,780
No problem.

348
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,960
So message not received.

349
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,280
It's not going to do anything because they've made so much money off of it at this point.

350
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,640
Like it's too late.

351
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,720
You the fact that you're still like, you know, the fact that you even considering, well,

352
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,560
the hundred dollar pack should be enough.

353
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,960
The fact that you're buying a $100 pack in this game in the first place is already a

354
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
problem.

355
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,560
Like, I would say yes, but I'm planning fully to drop $100 in theater them.

356
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,320
And I don't want to think about how much I've spent on things like that by daily.

357
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,920
Yeah, no, and I get that.

358
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,400
But this isn't like, you know, you're paying $100 in theater at them to randomly get some

359
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
songs.

360
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
I know what I'm getting.

361
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Yeah, I know.

362
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
In both of those circumstances.

363
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
I know what I'm getting.

364
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,280
It's a thing of is like a collector's edition or something like that.

365
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
That would be different.

366
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,240
Like if Madden had like a collector's edition, right?

367
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,400
However stupid it would be to charge like say $120 for it or something that did have

368
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,560
these cards in there, but it's they already know what they can get away with.

369
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,440
I mean, hell, just look at the game.

370
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,000
I mean, they're pretty much releasing the same product every year.

371
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,760
They're taking features out holding them for a few years in the magical Disney vault, and

372
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,640
then bringing them back later on and pretending Oh, look at this new feature that you this

373
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,800
is why Madden is great.

374
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
It's so innovative.

375
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,280
And it's like this was just what you had a few years ago, except now you're calling it

376
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,740
something different.

377
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,040
So I mean, they already know their target audience just either doesn't care or is too

378
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,640
stupid to figure it out.

379
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,840
And so they are just whatever, we're gonna keep doing what we want, because you can complain

380
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,200
about it all you want, create your hashtags and whatnot.

381
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,760
It's not going to affect us in the least until it does and then they walk it back.

382
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,660
But that's what happened with Star Wars because that was a single player game and stuff.

383
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,340
But you see, whereas they walked it back loop boxes there.

384
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,860
They just doubled down in FIFA and Madden, because they can get away with it there.

385
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,860
I want to get to a couple comments from chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

386
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,860
So SSU 100.

387
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,620
Matt says it's good that the streamers are the ones striking on these.

388
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,740
I wonder if the youtubers will as well.

389
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,820
EA cares a lot about these content creators not pushing their product.

390
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,940
But as we know, regardless what happens, folks will still buy the loot boxes.

391
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,620
Yeah, I mean, and you also make a good point is I would say the strongest statement.

392
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:44,380
You could make and this also ties into what red entertainment says tracks and theater

393
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,820
them can last for several years, card packs and this year's model of Madden only work

394
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,540
with this year's model of Madden.

395
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,740
And in my opinion, the biggest statement these streamers could make would be, again, similar

396
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,740
in the Diablo universe.

397
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,620
You had a very large website about min maxing a max role.

398
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,060
It's something I've something I didn't know a lot about at the time.

399
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,180
But ever since I got back into Diablo three, as with Alan, like we've been using that site

400
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,300
a lot.

401
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,100
Max role pulled their coverage of Diablo immortal said, you know what, we're no longer covering

402
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
this game.

403
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,260
We're going to focus on Diablo two and Diablo three.

404
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,820
We're not going to talk about immortal anymore, basically.

405
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,920
And in my opinion, if the Madden streamers really want to make an impact, I would say

406
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,420
continue to stream Madden 22.

407
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,420
And don't even don't even acknowledge this new game for a variety of reasons.

408
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,920
You know, again, it's I don't want to just shit on a sports game for the sake of shitting

409
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,100
on a sports game.

410
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
Like I understand.

411
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,700
Well, but Darkseid, that's not fair, you know, because when they were shitting on DDR,

412
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,400
we had a lot to say about that, right?

413
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Like it's whatever.

414
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Yeah, I know.

415
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
I know.

416
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,620
But it but it still needs to be said, like, you know, people can have their faves and

417
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,620
all that.

418
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,620
That's fine.

419
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,820
But when it comes to, you know, Madden and how bad 23 appears to be, even if you're a

420
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,820
fan, not just with these, you know, built in issues, but just with, you know, a lot

421
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,000
of the whole like, it's the same stuff, but it sounds like things aren't implemented well

422
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,240
that why not just continue to play Madden 22 and be like, you know what, until EA you

423
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,560
make a game worth upgrading from, we're just going to stick with the game that works, which

424
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,000
for all I know, is probably not even Madden 22.

425
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,520
It's probably have to go back further, to be honest.

426
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,040
And that goes back to something that I always say is, you know, be critical of what you

427
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
love.

428
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Yeah.

429
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,120
And we do that a lot here.

430
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:38,560
Just because you're complaining about your, you know, a game, it doesn't mean that you

431
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:44,560
don't love the franchise, or you know what it could be capable of, it means that you

432
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,320
care enough to be vocal to give some real criticism about it.

433
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,440
And I'm not just saying you go over the socks, and then you know, not expand upon that, but

434
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,160
absolutely have something that's going to back up your reasoning for your opinion.

435
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:06,520
And then the second thing about it, put action to it, nothing changes until you make it change.

436
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:13,160
And look at the boy, the boycott is the right idea.

437
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,800
And I mean, look at the amount of monetization they're doing in a $60 I'm actually I think

438
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:24,320
it's 60 years at $70 now I don't even know game that really should be free to play at

439
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
this point.

440
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
If that's all they're doing.

441
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,900
They're not updating the game at all each year there.

442
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,900
It's just literally a roster update.

443
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,480
And like I said, they've been caught even in some versions having the old assets in

444
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
the game.

445
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,220
Like, come on, you know,

446
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,580
saving money, but don't be obvious about it.

447
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,140
They're making billions of dollars off of this, like they're not putting any of that

448
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,700
money back into the franchise, it would be different if they're like monetizing the crap

449
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,700
out of it.

450
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,200
But it's just such an amazing groundbreaking game.

451
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,580
It's not that anymore.

452
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,760
It's just, they're not forced to compete.

453
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,620
And so the game doesn't innovate because they have the license, which this is partly NFL's

454
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,460
fault as well, because they're the ones not licensing it to other companies.

455
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,020
And so now the NFL has this crappy game that they get to put their brand on.

456
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,140
I mean, cool.

457
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:21,060
Mike Deft confirms $70 for man 23 on the PS five, and last gen versions are 60, which is

458
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,060
kind of what we seen.

459
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,180
I honestly, I really think, you know, but obviously EA is going to hate this idea because

460
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,060
it's less money for them, but I really think, you know what, put the effort into making

461
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:37,820
a solid, fun football game, and then you know what, pay $20 for the licensed annual updates

462
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,300
and put out a really solid game every four years.

463
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,020
Anyway, you're still going to make money off of all these, you know, cards and all these

464
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
other things too.

465
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:50,060
But like, why, why have this ruse of these major changes for 70 bucks?

466
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,980
Why not just do 20 bucks for like an expansion pack?

467
00:24:52,980 --> 00:25:04,020
Why not do the dead by daylight model seriously, you know, put out a new chapter for like each,

468
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,460
each season with the new players or have like DLC in case they've brought in like someone

469
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,700
new mid season or something, you know, I don't know if people actually do that because it's

470
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
sports ball.

471
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
I don't care.

472
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:24,900
But I mean, I think that doing that way saves them a lot of time on production because then

473
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,500
they have their base game engine, hopefully perfected.

474
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
It's not.

475
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,180
It's not even close to perfect.

476
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,540
It's buggy as hell.

477
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:42,160
Let me finish that if they have, if they have an engine that works that they have perfected

478
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:48,560
and put that one into implementation and then just build on that, you know, you know, eventually

479
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,200
it is going to run to a point where they may have to update like whatever their engine

480
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,600
is, but that hopefully won't be for some time because you know, the, the, the engine is

481
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,480
going to be what runs the game.

482
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,900
You're just going to change the shell on top of it and maybe like every couple of years,

483
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:13,540
you know, have a, we've done this cosmetic upgrade, update your game for the, you know,

484
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:22,980
for the updated fields or crowd effects or whatever, you know, and that way it's in the

485
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:29,820
end going to save them money because they aren't going to have to work into, you know,

486
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:36,380
on the production of a brand new game that, you know, they're going to have to make all

487
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,540
new assets for, even though we've seen proof that they're not doing it.

488
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:48,020
They can just recycle assets that are going to, you know, if they, if they still are graphically,

489
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:56,100
you know, fine, then keep using the same assets, you know, maybe, maybe, you know, have upscale

490
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,220
options or something, or, you know, every few years, like I was saying with the engine,

491
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,740
if the engine's been updated, update the, the models as well.

492
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:11,180
And that way you can, you know, they can put more dedicated time into it, less time than

493
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,580
what they would do to crank out a new game every year.

494
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:20,980
And you know, also it's kinder to their employees, it's kinder to the market, put out the base

495
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:27,860
game for 20 bucks and have the updates be, you know, like do a few of them every year.

496
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:36,260
Because if people pay like, say $15 for an update and they're doing it, say three times

497
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:42,140
a year, that's $45 per person playing the game, right?

498
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,300
And then you put out the DLC packets, like here's your fan packet.

499
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:52,340
If you were a fan of the sea chickens or something, I called them sea chickens because Dan calls

500
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,540
them sea chickens, the Seahawks.

501
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
But do you see my point?

502
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,500
Yeah, let me, Loki, do you want to jump in or otherwise I'm gonna get to chat comments.

503
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,980
Oh, I was just gonna say, well, they, this is the model that they've already adapted for like,

504
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,820
almost everything that they have, which is basically release unfinished products,

505
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,260
and monetize the crap out of them, and only do something when there's massive backlash to it.

506
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,100
I mean, that's, look at look at Battlefield, that that series is suffering because of the way that

507
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,060
they treated it.

508
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,500
Look at Mommy Madden's just been mad and it's been suffering for years.

509
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,940
But same problem with FIFA too.

510
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,980
Like, they're fundamentally buggy as hell, and unfinished and unpolished.

511
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,540
And considering that they're reusing the same game over and over again, it's really weird

512
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,660
to see the same bugs every single year in that stuff.

513
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:46,900
Like, it's just, there's really no excuse at this point for this like kind of product,

514
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,100
especially with the amount of money that they have coming in.

515
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,860
It's not a matter of like, we don't have the funds to produce a good game.

516
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,300
It's just they don't care.

517
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,380
They're just giving it all to their shareholders.

518
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,500
And so like, I just don't this is why no one trusts EA to make a good game anymore.

519
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,980
It's just whatever it is what it is.

520
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,660
But used to be the company.

521
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,340
Let me go to chat and get some of the comments here over twitch.tv slash vog network.

522
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,500
So Tiger Claw and chat asks, should Madden be games as a service rather than release

523
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,780
new games every year?

524
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,060
Well, in my opinion, they're trying to monetize the game like it's both already.

525
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,140
And that's there in lies the problem.

526
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,420
They want their they're literally want their cake and eating it too.

527
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,460
And so I think they need to ditch the new games every year and just admit what they're

528
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,700
trying to do, which is the games as a service.

529
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,980
And that also tried to do games of the service member type was it member?

530
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,620
Oh, God was there I can't even remember the game because it's been blocked out of my mind.

531
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,020
They're stupid jetpack games as a service game that folded because it was awful.

532
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,460
That's not sports.

533
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,820
I'm talking matter.

534
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,460
It's EA.

535
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,380
Well, yeah, but I'm I'm pointing out the anthem flop for different reasons.

536
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,220
But anyway, that's true.

537
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,300
And Matt says, I will say in the sports game developers defense, the devs have a very short

538
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,660
window to make each year's game.

539
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,980
They roughly have about eight months to make a new game.

540
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,060
First four months are spent patching updates work.

541
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,700
That's exactly.

542
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,140
But that's exactly what I'm that's what needs to change is that that whole.

543
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,100
Yeah.

544
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,460
And that's that's the same thing I've been trying to say, too, with that whole idea about,

545
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:13,940
you know what?

546
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,300
Put out a new game every three years and do an expansion pack for the rosters and maybe

547
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:24,180
one or two cool new features or modes in the off years to get your money there, too, if

548
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,740
you must.

549
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:30,820
But this whole concept of seventy dollar games every year, like the reality is maybe you

550
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:36,660
could poop out a game in a year in the Genesis era when these games all first started to

551
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,780
come to, you know, a really big prominence and so forth.

552
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,700
But this is not a possibility in the PlayStation five era anymore.

553
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,020
Games are not developed the way they used to be.

554
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,060
At least games of this scale are not developed the way they used to be.

555
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,180
You know what I mean?

556
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,860
It might have taken one or two people to make trombone champ, but that's a different, you

557
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,380
know, a completely different type of game.

558
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,020
Well, if they're they're hell bent on putting out a game out every single year, then what

559
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,820
you got to do is you got to go the call of duty method where you have multiple studios

560
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,060
working on these games and cycling through them.

561
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,820
So their development time is like three years and you have three studios working on you

562
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,180
making billions of dollars.

563
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,300
You can afford it.

564
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,420
The thing is, they don't want to put the money into it because they're going to make those

565
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,540
billions of dollars, whether they put out a piece of crap or they put out a great piece

566
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,540
of, you know, quality content.

567
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:28,260
It's such a monetarily minimal difference in what they're going to make, you know, other

568
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,860
than the praise or whatnot.

569
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,980
They just don't care is what it is.

570
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,460
Well, again, the best thing you can do is vote with your wallet.

571
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,900
And, you know, if you don't agree with it, you've got to resist the temptation to buy

572
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,860
the game and especially the DLC that's within the game.

573
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,740
But the reality is, especially in the streaming culture, you know, people you feel that they

574
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,540
need to play those latest and greatest things to get those views.

575
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,380
And that may be true that, you know, there's lots of streamers out there.

576
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,660
And if you're not streaming the thing somebody wants to see, they'll go somewhere else.

577
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:04,100
But I think even we as people that consume streams have to if we believe strongly enough

578
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,740
that this game sucks and shouldn't be supported, the development behind it, that we have to

579
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,900
stop watching those types of streams.

580
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,740
That goes for much more than just Madden.

581
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,900
That also goes for something like Anthem, which was something that was up my alley.

582
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,420
But the issues with that game were transparent from the very beginning.

583
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,900
And it's really too bad.

584
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,820
So, all right.

585
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,940
Well, let's move on and talk about the games that we are enjoying in a segment called How

586
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,900
Is Your Gaming Week?

587
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,380
And so what are we supporting this week with our playtime?

588
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,340
We'll go to Dark Soccer.

589
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,220
How is your gaming week?

590
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,620
My gaming week was pretty fun.

591
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,540
I, of course, was playing Dead by Daylight.

592
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,860
I actually played some killer matches.

593
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,780
I had a factually I had a very funny thing happen.

594
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,100
So I made some new friends.

595
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,020
But let me tell you how I made my new friends.

596
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,860
Gwen had to sign off and we normally play together.

597
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,780
So I ended up playing killer.

598
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,740
And, you know, as I've been wanting to do lately, I've just been sort of fucking off

599
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,820
and letting, you know, letting survivors have a good time, you know, just trying to do my

600
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,460
challenges and letting people out, you know, because so many other killers are big, you

601
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,500
know, stink nuggets.

602
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,660
And then I made friends with two of the survivors in the endgame chat.

603
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
And I was like, well, hey, do you mind if I Swift with you?

604
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,500
And they're like, yeah, come Swift with us.

605
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:34,340
And so I played with them and then we made friends with the killer in the endgame chat

606
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,300
after that.

607
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:42,100
So I have started following Paisley Panda, that's Paisley with an IE, who is absolutely

608
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:50,660
a delightful non-binary Dead by Daylight killer learning huntress and absolutely fun.

609
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,900
But I've never had something like that happen.

610
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:59,060
And I think that it goes back to kind of my whole theory about, you know, if you have

611
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:04,420
a chance and a reason to be nice in the endgame chat, then sometimes it can work out to your

612
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,060
advantage.

613
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,300
You can make friends and, you know, and then if the person is a shit to you, then you just

614
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,340
make them look bad because you're a nice person and they're not.

615
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:20,180
But in this case, it was very interesting situation that happened.

616
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,940
I made new friends to play with and found another streamer who does some absolutely

617
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,060
delightful content.

618
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,140
And I had a good time.

619
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:36,180
Um, I'm also working on at least getting all of my survivors to prestige one.

620
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,220
And I'm trying to talk myself into playing Wesker.

621
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:44,180
It's just, I don't feel right playing Wesker right now with all of the fucking Weskers

622
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,420
that are every fucking where in the game.

623
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,300
I won't play him either.

624
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,340
Yeah, I can wait on my adapt.

625
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,420
I'm not, I'm not hyper about it.

626
00:34:53,060 --> 00:35:00,580
Um, but, um, I've also of course been playing cult of the lamb, which is a very delightful

627
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,220
game.

628
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,020
Funny enough.

629
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,420
Okay.

630
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,140
So I didn't stream final fantasy for last night like I normally do because we looked

631
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:14,340
into tickets to see where now and we, um, we missed the chance to get the tickets in

632
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,460
the first place because we had already been to the tour.

633
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,340
It's the one where he does all of his original, like the style parodies and not the actual

634
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,300
parody parodies.

635
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,820
Um, but when we went to the first one, it was all unplugged and this one wasn't, it

636
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,140
was, you know, full on guitars and everything.

637
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,860
It was really fun.

638
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:39,780
Um, but, uh, we sat with, uh, a couple of guys and one of them had a Triforce tattoo

639
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,460
when we just started talking about games.

640
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:48,580
Um, and, uh, he's like, so there's this game called cult of the land.

641
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,540
I'm like, oh yeah, I streamed that thing on Mondays and he's like, awesome.

642
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,460
And then I, you know, we, we just chatted for a little bit.

643
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,260
Where was the show?

644
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,540
Is that here in SAC?

645
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,940
It was at the Mondavi center in Davis.

646
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,220
Oh, okay.

647
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,540
Okay.

648
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,500
I haven't been there in a long time.

649
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,940
I think I saw Margaret show there once.

650
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,500
You and I saw Margaret show there.

651
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,100
I think that was like the only time I've ever been there.

652
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,820
Okay, cool.

653
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,300
That was, I think the last time I went there and they've really built up around that.

654
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:18,980
Um, and no, uh, I haven't seen the weird Al biopic yet.

655
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,820
Um, but he did talk about it.

656
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,380
Um, and I'm looking forward to seeing it.

657
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,260
Of course I've seen UHF 50,000 times.

658
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,620
I got engaged to that movie.

659
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,300
But, um, I don't think the bio picks out yet.

660
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,260
Cause I definitely want to see that.

661
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,060
It's November.

662
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,180
Yeah.

663
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,620
And actually Bobby just said that.

664
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:44,100
Um, but, uh, but I'm really, I'm, I'm looking forward to that.

665
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,580
And of course to getting my, my pinball table.

666
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:54,420
Um, I played doctor who pinball today and actually had a very decent third ball.

667
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,540
Um, that game likes to drain like a bitch.

668
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,100
Um, but I, I had multi ball happen a couple of times.

669
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:08,740
Um, and I keep forgetting just how much the Dalek voice in that one, because the speakers

670
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,700
aren't the best, uh, makes my head hurt.

671
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,380
Of course I already had a headache.

672
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:19,060
Um, but yeah, and of course tonight I'm going to be playing dead by daylight later.

673
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:25,460
If anyone wants to play with me and Gwen, um, I've also been really hooked on my word

674
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,820
scapes, like unbelievably hooked on my word scapes.

675
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:36,340
Um, especially now that they seem to have had new, um, new puzzles released.

676
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,980
Cause I'm finally starting to see different words.

677
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:47,380
Um, I like that one of the words now is Eureka and that, uh, it still doesn't like for me

678
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,220
to, to play body parts.

679
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,820
Although it does recognize that orgy is a word.

680
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,740
It will not recognize butt sex.

681
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,420
Cause remember you can't spell subtext without butt sex.

682
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,580
It's true.

683
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,620
Useful life advice.

684
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,180
Thank you.

685
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:04,740
Useful.

686
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,780
I learned the hard way.

687
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,220
It's the, it's the same letters.

688
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:15,700
Um, but, um, I'm also trying to, I, I've, I'm about ready to finish final fantasy four.

689
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,700
So I'm trying to decide if I want to do five or move on to star ocean.

690
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
So I'm probably putting a pull up.

691
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,020
I'm personally leaning toward five just cause I haven't played the game in an age.

692
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,460
Yeah.

693
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,540
And I've never played star ocean.

694
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:35,780
So five is, um, a little weirder because you know, those of us in the U S well, it's just

695
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,140
that like those of us in the U S don't have those high school memories or whatever you

696
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,620
want to call it a five because we never got to play five until when, when did they finally

697
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,580
officially release it here?

698
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,180
Was it in the PS one classic Sarah?

699
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,540
When they finally let us play that game or was it even later than that?

700
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,260
Yes.

701
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,780
So I had played translated copies of it before.

702
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,020
Um, oh yeah.

703
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,140
I remember the translator ROM.

704
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,660
That's how I played it in college, but even the translator ROM had its issues, you know,

705
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,020
it was still, it was still weird.

706
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,580
Yeah.

707
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,100
But all right.

708
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,500
Oh yeah.

709
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:04,820
Yeah.

710
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,940
It's character's name was butts.

711
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,460
Yeah.

712
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:15,300
I always, my, I always translated it as like Batsu as in like, you know, the same spelling

713
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,580
as Batsu from, uh, uh, project justice or, uh, she did to justice.

714
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,620
Kuckling.

715
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:28,260
Um, so, but there's other people who do it like as Bart's or something.

716
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,380
I just say Batsu.

717
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,020
Yeah.

718
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:35,220
Um, but I, I don't remember a whole lot of it, even though I've beaten it.

719
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,660
So I'm looking forward to re-familiarizing myself with that.

720
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,500
Um, and again, I haven't played star ocean.

721
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,180
I also have Emerald dragon.

722
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,900
Um, but I'm trying to decide when I play that, if I'm going to do the turbo graphics version,

723
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,940
cause I do own the turbo graphics version.

724
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:02,180
Um, like a legit Japanese one, or if I'm going to play the, the super Famicom one.

725
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:08,420
Um, and, and, and, and also I picked up, uh, a game and I don't think he can hear me, but

726
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:14,900
I picked up, um, uh, Kunio, uh, dodge ball as in super dodge ball.

727
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,460
Oh, super Famicom.

728
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:17,960
Great.

729
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:25,480
So I'm, I'm hoping that, uh, spouse gets a kick out of it, even though we've got it on

730
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,120
the upper drive.

731
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,360
All right.

732
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,560
Oh, oh, one last thing.

733
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,060
Yeah.

734
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:36,920
On teepublic, I found Vib ribbon t-shirts and stickers, and I have a Vib ribbon sticker

735
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:43,160
now that when, uh, you're doing your gaming week, I will try to find my picture album

736
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,960
and show.

737
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,120
There is a dangerous sale on that site yesterday.

738
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,720
Cause, uh, it's always on, there's always dangerous sales on there.

739
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,280
I know, right?

740
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,240
That's why I got this shirt.

741
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,360
I absolutely want a Vib ribbon shirt.

742
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,320
It's so cute.

743
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,360
And I love Vibri.

744
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:01,000
In fact, to the point that I've actually been trying, I've been considering finding a copy

745
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,240
of Moji ribbon, even though it's very text heavy.

746
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,960
What is your, what is your shirt?

747
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,280
Loki?

748
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,880
Cause the microphone kind of blocks it for us.

749
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,000
So I can't really see what's on it.

750
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,560
It's a met.

751
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,760
Oh, if you can see it.

752
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,200
Oh, okay.

753
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:14,600
Yeah.

754
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,760
It's it's hard to see, but yeah.

755
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,000
Okay.

756
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,640
Oh, and one more thing.

757
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:19,880
Yeah.

758
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,760
I might've said it.

759
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,520
I ordered a reverse bear trap today.

760
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,240
Yeah.

761
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,120
You mentioned that in the beginning.

762
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,600
That's all right.

763
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:24,920
Yeah.

764
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,560
All right.

765
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,120
Let's uh, go to Loki and talk about your gaming week.

766
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,760
How was your game?

767
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,560
So, uh, I played mostly Minecraft this week as usual.

768
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,760
I know it's shocking.

769
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,560
It's I've been working on that massive project still, which I just about done with.

770
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:47,000
I have the main, the main, uh, body done and I'm finishing up with the last bits of the arms and

771
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,800
stuff.

772
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,960
So that'll be coming this week in a video.

773
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,480
I wanted to have it out this weekend, but it's just, it was too massive to be able to finish

774
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:55,960
this week.

775
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,160
And I tried lots of hours, like 80 some hours in there.

776
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:08,600
Um, uh, I also played, uh, was it, uh, trombone, uh, champion.

777
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,360
I think that's what it's called now.

778
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:10,760
Trombone.

779
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:11,880
Yeah.

780
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,600
Trombone champ.

781
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,680
Very fun game.

782
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,640
Very strange game.

783
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,080
Hard for me to play that.

784
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,920
I don't know, like with the mouse stuff, like, I feel like it's hard to like, kind of move

785
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,240
fast.

786
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,560
If I think I need to adjust some of the settings in there, I've definitely took off the, um,

787
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,520
inverter controls.

788
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,240
Cause that was annoying.

789
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,040
But, um, yeah, it's a funny game.

790
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,240
I like the, the mix between like, it's like, we music almost like the presentation of it

791
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:43,960
with like baboons and like, what else?

792
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:51,640
Like they also have like, uh, like, um, all sorts of like weird, uh, sirens and stuff

793
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,600
going off in it.

794
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,120
And, um, it's just a really weird mashup of things, but it's funny.

795
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,080
It's worth checking out.

796
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,120
All right.

797
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,600
Um, so yeah, I wanted to get to monkey Island this week, but I didn't get to that, but hopefully

798
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,000
you soon.

799
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,140
All right.

800
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,280
Uh, my gaming week.

801
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,360
So you might notice if you're watching live on Twitch, I have these giant headphones cause

802
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,240
they're new.

803
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,840
I bought new headphones this week cause my other ones finally died, which was sad and

804
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,600
it was getting very annoying, but it's been nice to actually be able to hear games again.

805
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,960
The, um, the audio is really, it's a, it's a razor crack and, uh, I think this is the

806
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,640
V3, so it was on sale.

807
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,080
So, um, yeah, it does the, it does the chroma lights in it, although they're very hard to

808
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,360
see on the stream right now.

809
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,600
Um, but yeah, so like when I play Diablo three, they turn red and all that silly stuff.

810
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,440
So yeah, it's fun.

811
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,200
It's, it's, it's silly, but it's fun.

812
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,880
But, um, as far as games that I've been enjoying using it, uh, a lot of the same old stuff,

813
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,200
you know, I've also been playing dead by daylight.

814
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,400
I'm getting really close to finishing this tome, which I never do.

815
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,360
I never do.

816
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,560
So that is, uh, that is quite an accomplishment in itself.

817
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Uh, mostly really good cosmetics, by the way, in the rift.

818
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,440
Did you get them?

819
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,560
Uh, no, I'm, uh, when I say finish, I mean, get through the fourth page.

820
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,320
I never even get that far.

821
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,920
So, but I'm only like two challenges away.

822
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,320
So I'm going to stream tomorrow to try to finish.

823
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,360
Cause I'm really close.

824
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,400
I got, I made really good progress on the gen generator.

825
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:13,720
Okay.

826
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,240
I should, I should be around after work.

827
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,560
I just not sure the specifics for the holiday and that should be after services.

828
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:19,880
Nice.

829
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,120
Okay.

830
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,720
Yeah, it should be about four 30.

831
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:26,440
Um, so, um, I'll, I'll be playing a little bit of that, trying to finish that.

832
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,560
And, um, I did a little killer as well.

833
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:34,040
So, um, uh, I played that all on stream, my own stream on Friday.

834
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,160
Um, I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14.

835
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,280
Uh, I finished the Island, which I think I may have done last week, uh, got my Island

836
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,160
to rank 10.

837
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:49,320
But this week I actually built every building the farthest it could go.

838
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,520
Um, so I've built all my granaries to level three, all the workshops to level three.

839
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,320
So like literally everything is maxed out.

840
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,720
And then I found out there is another special artifact that you can make, but it is, it's

841
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,720
a really hard crafting project.

842
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:12,200
So I can either buy the mats for 3 million Gil, which I'm thinking about doing, or I

843
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,600
can just invest in my crafters and try to make this.

844
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,080
So it's, it's called a water otter fountain.

845
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,080
So I'm trying to make that for my Island.

846
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,480
I'm telling you, some people raid, some people glamour.

847
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,040
I am all in on that stupid Island life thing.

848
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,920
It's great.

849
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,240
And I'm so excited for them to make enhancements to it later.

850
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,920
Sounds like animal crossing.

851
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,040
I would say it's, it's definitely influenced by that, but it's, um, more the, um, you

852
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,320
know, the farming SIM games, uh, that are a plenty in Japanese culture that we see over.

853
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:43,640
Yeah.

854
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,920
All of it, all of it.

855
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:50,200
So it's, you know, it's, it's not as in depth, but it's definitely inspired by that stuff.

856
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:57,000
So, uh, let's see, uh, pod culture says you didn't go for the kitty ear version talking

857
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,440
about my headphones to which tape plays games calls me a fake streamer.

858
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:09,240
Uh, no, I did the, these generic, uh, you know, bland, uh, heterosexual black ones were

859
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,040
on sale.

860
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,760
So I just bought the, cause price always is going to win over functions.

861
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,240
So there is that.

862
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,040
Um, let's see.

863
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,440
So, uh, what else have I played during my gaming week?

864
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,640
Um, I played Assassin's Creed Odyssey a little more than on Wednesday.

865
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,280
I'm still liking that game more than I thought I would.

866
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,720
Um, don't love the boat fights though, because once you get like a full big boat, then you

867
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,800
get into these things where you get into like Archer fights with other boats and these big

868
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,560
boat, I didn't like that part.

869
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,080
It was really clunky to me.

870
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,640
I don't like trying to drive the boat around and all that stuff.

871
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:49,080
And that part's not fun, but that's otherwise just a blemish on what I'm, I'm still enjoying

872
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,040
as a game.

873
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,640
Um, that was a pretty fun.

874
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:52,600
Okay.

875
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,160
So Rob, you've talked about most of those games and playing before.

876
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,320
Did you play anything new this week?

877
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,120
Yes, I did.

878
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,800
I did play one new game this week.

879
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,360
And so we actually have a story coming up later in the show about this series of games.

880
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,160
And I decided to jump in and buy one of them.

881
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,360
So it's the Atari recharged games.

882
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,920
So that is exactly the reaction I had.

883
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,960
Is that the collection or is that like just the remade game?

884
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,600
Okay.

885
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,200
They are working on a collection.

886
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,120
There's that there's like a 50 collection.

887
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:27,080
There's the mini game thing, the WarioWare thing, but with Atari that is coming out in

888
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,800
October.

889
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,480
But I didn't even realize these recharge things, which they've done for Centipede, Breakout,

890
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,640
Gravatar, Asteroids.

891
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,560
Like there's quite a few of them, right?

892
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:44,120
They've they're out and they've been now I think they were out on Atari VCS first, but

893
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,840
of course, how many people actually bought into that?

894
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,640
And I think Atari start to realize that too.

895
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,640
So they've been doing these releases on Steam.

896
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:58,360
So the one that I picked up was Yars Revenge Recharge because I love that 2600 game.

897
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,640
I don't know how many of you remember that from back in the day, but here's a little

898
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,280
peek at what it looks like for those that are watching on Twitch.

899
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,640
So you can see it has a lot of the similar mechanic from the first game where you try

900
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,480
to go in, you're trying to either shoot the shields or you can eat the shields.

901
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:18,760
And then you're charging that giant photon laser that you then try to blast the main

902
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,320
cannon with.

903
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,080
If you've ever played the original Yars Revenge, that will make a little more sense

904
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,360
than if you've never played the game.

905
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:29,240
Then it just sounds like I'm kind of just speaking of another language, which, you know,

906
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:29,960
I get it.

907
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,560
But of course, the thing about this game is because it's recharged, it's very pretty,

908
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,160
bright, has that kind of geometry wars.

909
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,160
And literally it's a twin stick shooter now because, you know, the Atari 2600 only had

910
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,760
what the joystick and the one button now.

911
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,320
But of course, they changed it into a twin stick shooter.

912
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,840
But of course, the levels become a lot more elaborate.

913
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,160
So for example, on Twitch, we're watching a stage where you have the main cannon in

914
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,600
the center, but then you have six sub cannons around the main cannon and the main cannon

915
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,600
powers one of the sub cannons at a time to do a different type of move.

916
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,920
So it adds a little bit of chaos into the generic formula or into the regular formula

917
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,520
from the old game, which, you know, might have felt a little generic because it was

918
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,720
on the Atari 2600.

919
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,440
Um, is this game like a revolutionary twin stick shooter?

920
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,160
Nah.

921
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,960
But does it do the nostalgia factor pretty well?

922
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,520
Yeah.

923
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,440
Like I was pleasantly surprised.

924
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,200
I kind of like this a lot more than I thought I would.

925
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,280
So there's that.

926
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,800
So that was another game I played this week was Yars revenge recharge.

927
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,400
And now I'm a little curious to check out maybe some of those other Atari recharge games

928
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:37,800
as well.

929
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,840
I'm not sure they're all fantastic.

930
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:46,120
And I think you have to remember they are more inspired versions when, you know, keep

931
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:51,160
in mind Atari 2600 games fit into 4,000 kilobyte cartridges.

932
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,200
Most of them, that's 4,000 characters.

933
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:54,840
Okay.

934
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,000
That's a lot to squeeze into a cartridge.

935
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And so the game loops in these game games were very simple.

936
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,960
And so these recharge games are just kind of enhancing that game loop with some graphics

937
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,720
and some other little, but they're not going to totally reinvent the game because remember

938
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,160
there was like a Yars revenge sequel they did on like Xbox 360.

939
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,480
And it wasn't, it wasn't that good because it just completely deviated.

940
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,000
It's like they just took a new type of shooter game and put the Yars revenge name on it.

941
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,520
So yeah.

942
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,960
Tiger call is actually talking about it.

943
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,640
I remember when they tried to reboot this game as a rail shooter, it was a name only

944
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,440
good thing they made what looks like a true remake of the original.

945
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,760
I'm not sure I would call it a remake of the original, but yes, I otherwise get where you're

946
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:40,520
going with that comment is that it, it, it retains the spirit of the original much better

947
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,840
than a rail shooter, which, you know, was just any old other rail shooter did.

948
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,080
So.

949
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,280
Dark Tetsuya in chat says I played asteroid and centipede recharge.

950
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,720
They're fun, but I think my one complaint was that it's a one life and you're done

951
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,840
game instead of three.

952
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,320
But again, that kind of goes back to some of the old game loops.

953
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,680
Although I think, you know, even asteroids in the arcade and centipede, you did have

954
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,480
three lives.

955
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:09,160
So I think in this one and yours, you have three health States.

956
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,440
So that might be the type of thing they're doing instead is that instead of three lives,

957
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,800
you get three health States.

958
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,000
So I, but I haven't played those other ones yet, but I'll probably pick them up.

959
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,680
I enjoyed yards, revenge recharged enough to go.

960
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:20,920
Okay.

961
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,280
Cause it was only 10 bucks.

962
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,320
And I think missile command recharge is like three bucks right now.

963
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,880
So, you know, they're not trying to charge 60, 70 bucks for them, which is good.

964
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,240
Cause that, that would be laughable.

965
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,120
It would never get that.

966
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,240
They'd never get that.

967
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,280
So 10 bucks, that's a lot more reasonable.

968
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,320
So yeah.

969
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:38,680
All right.

970
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,320
We're going to get into some more gaming news.

971
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,560
First though, I just want to remind everybody.

972
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,680
We will be here live next week on October 2nd.

973
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,680
We will not be live on October 9th as mentioned plenty during the show.

974
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,520
Otherwise dark soccer and I both are going to be in San Diego at Twitch con.

975
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,680
We will not be back in time for the show.

976
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,040
I don't fly back till Monday.

977
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,840
And you heard dark soccer earlier say she's doing Disneyland on Monday.

978
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,680
So we won't be back in time for the show.

979
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,160
So it'll be Bobby will be here that night though.

980
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,920
So you can certainly tune in to VOG network and check out Bobby black Wolf.

981
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,360
Maybe he'll run long.

982
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,680
Maybe he can call you next week or in two weeks.

983
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,560
Loki.

984
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,040
I don't know.

985
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,680
Or Loki.

986
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,680
I don't know if you're planning on doing a stream or anything, but just take a night

987
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:18,920
off.

988
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,560
You earned it.

989
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,680
It's hard to say.

990
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,040
Hard to say you didn't earn it.

991
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,720
So there's no time to take time.

992
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,160
I have to keep making stuff.

993
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,760
So you have to keep mining and crafting.

994
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,040
All right.

995
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:37,560
Let's tell you how many, how many, how many materials are 300,000 blocks, 185 shulker

996
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,920
boxes worth of materials.

997
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,200
I was gonna say, I thought your last build was something like 200,000 blocks.

998
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,200
You said this one is 300,000.

999
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:46,760
Yeah.

1000
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,260
Yeah.

1001
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:48,520
All right.

1002
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,560
Well, we'll, we'll keep an eye out for the YouTube.

1003
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,960
All right, let's move on.

1004
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,920
Let's get into tonight's first story, which has to official first story, which has to

1005
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,920
do with some other ongoing Twitch issues of which there were several this week.

1006
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,440
So there was a lot.

1007
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,360
Start us off with the first couple Loki.

1008
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,480
Twitch has had a week.

1009
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:19,960
So starting things off, there was a live stream by a streamer known as a slicker who basically

1010
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:27,400
admitted to after being called out about it to stealing, or I should say, scamming people

1011
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:33,720
out of $200,000 to fund his gambling addiction.

1012
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:41,000
So he was, I guess he was betting on CSGO stuff.

1013
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,840
I'm not really sure if that was the case.

1014
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:49,000
I thought it was sports betting is what I thought it was, but may have been CSGO.

1015
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,640
Who knows?

1016
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,280
It doesn't matter.

1017
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:56,360
So he, he came out and basically he was going and asking people like making up stories like,

1018
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,360
Oh yeah, my funds are frozen.

1019
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,280
He would go ask his streamer friends.

1020
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,600
He would ask his viewers, just ridiculous stuff.

1021
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,200
And then finally admitted to it.

1022
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,320
Tape, thankfully, just tape play games in our chat is clarifying.

1023
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,200
CSGO is what first ignited it, but it was sports betting.

1024
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,280
Yeah, I thought it was sports betting.

1025
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,120
And I think it was more than 200,002.

1026
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:23,400
I think it ended up being like 350,000, but it was a lot of money they scammed out of

1027
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,120
different people.

1028
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,480
So there was that, that kind of kicked everything off.

1029
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,680
So then when people started hearing about it, of course, reacting to it and stuff, there

1030
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:42,760
was this movement by Pokimane, Mizkif, and I think others as well that had been Devin

1031
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:48,520
Nash, I guess, who had been threatening to boycott Twitch for a week during Christmas

1032
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:57,240
to perform or to protest their kind of supporting these gambling streams, lax policies on them.

1033
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,400
So they made this like they were talking about and stuff like that.

1034
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:07,400
So then fast forward to shortly thereafter where Twitch comes out.

1035
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Just jump in before you get to the Twitch thing.

1036
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,000
I have to say it because I know there's plenty of you that are thinking it and there's a

1037
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,200
lot of people that are saying this.

1038
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,840
In fact, there's Bobby Black Wolf into chat saying this, too.

1039
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,120
It's amazing.

1040
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,640
And Bobby says it's amazing how these top tier streamers know they can throw their weight

1041
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,280
around like this, but they were silent during the hate raids.

1042
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,040
Actually, not all of them were silent.

1043
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:30,360
I believe some of them were on record because when you do YouTube, you do these streamings,

1044
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,400
you have these clips out there.

1045
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:36,200
Some of them were on record saying, and I quote, what was the hashtag they were using

1046
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,960
for the Twitch day off for that?

1047
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,120
A day without Twitch, I think was what they were calling it.

1048
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,320
I'm sorry if I'm messing the name up.

1049
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,640
It was a few months ago, and I don't recall.

1050
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,600
But with some of these streamers, the same people, some of them were on the record saying

1051
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,840
a day off Twitch will never work.

1052
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,480
And yet with this now they're going and they're saying this is what we need to do.

1053
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,480
So it definitely looks not good now.

1054
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,080
You know, I think Pokimane are one of them, and I'm sorry if I'm misattributing.

1055
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,480
I don't have look, I'm a grown ass man.

1056
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,240
I don't have enough time to follow a lot of this Twitch drama and who said what and he

1057
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,000
said she said and all this crap.

1058
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,640
So I can really only look at the bottom line sometimes.

1059
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:20,920
But one of them went on record and said like, well, I've learned a lot since then.

1060
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,400
And you know, I was trying to be quiet.

1061
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,040
I was trying to do things behind the scenes last time and make change happen.

1062
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,680
But I've learned since then that you have to get loud.

1063
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:37,320
OK, so I will smile, acknowledge politely one clap.

1064
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:43,160
Your evolution that you've come full circle and you realized, but you have to understand

1065
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:50,760
it is incredibly frustrating for many people when you were supposed to have their backs

1066
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:57,240
during this hate raid crisis that you as a big streamer came off as not caring because

1067
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,920
it's not something that affects you.

1068
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,240
Or can't you just put your stream into follow only mode or any of this stuff?

1069
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:10,280
Because unfortunately, a lot of these big streamers have not had to deal with being

1070
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:16,520
called a slur, whether racial, sexual, other type of minorities.

1071
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,360
I mean, look at the most popular streamers.

1072
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,000
Most of them have never had to deal with being called a slur before.

1073
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,960
So they clearly don't understand the psychological toll that it takes on a lot of people and

1074
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,960
that it's much more than just clicking a button to make it all stop and go away.

1075
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:40,760
So I that part has to be said because there's there's a lot of voices out there, especially

1076
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,480
folks, you know, people of color and other minorities out there that are saying like,

1077
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,400
where were y'all when it was the hate raids?

1078
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:53,480
And it does need to be said like, again, I can applaud evolution.

1079
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:59,640
And OK, we do need if you got to educate people and if people are showing they're educated,

1080
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,200
then OK.

1081
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:07,400
But it also seems like and I got to be honest, I'm not trying to poopoo gambling addiction.

1082
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,600
It's a serious issue.

1083
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,600
It's a serious thing and so forth.

1084
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:17,000
But it's it's also kind of like one guy's issue that really blew up.

1085
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,160
And I understand that there's also much more gambling stuff that's on Twitch, especially

1086
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,520
when we get into the CD crypto sites and that type of stuff.

1087
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:32,200
And I completely understand that Twitch at the end of the day is ultimately responsible

1088
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,800
for what's on its shelf.

1089
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,120
Right.

1090
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:38,200
A store, if they don't want to carry something on the shelf, they don't have to carry that

1091
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,720
particular item on the shelf.

1092
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:45,160
Yeah, I'm just surprised that this is what they decided to address.

1093
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:51,480
That's that's the weird thing that it took this for you to decide crypto gambling was

1094
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,000
something that maybe should be addressed or I don't know.

1095
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,040
They're trying to I get the sense they're kind of trying to say now that, well, we were

1096
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:04,440
going to do this the whole time and now we're going to unveil our policy today because of

1097
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,440
all this chatter that's been going on.

1098
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,320
It just the timing is a little.

1099
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:10,840
Yeah.

1100
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,440
Tay says, I'm surprised you're surprised.

1101
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:12,680
Yeah.

1102
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,080
Yeah, sure.

1103
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,200
Nothing should be shocking anymore.

1104
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,080
Yeah, I get it.

1105
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,640
It's just it's just the timing.

1106
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,440
Sus, right?

1107
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,080
That whole thing.

1108
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:27,240
So because they're they're supposed to be making the ads so that they made it.

1109
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:34,280
Twitch came out later on, said, Yeah, we're basically going to crack down on some things.

1110
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,920
So they're going to be making a policy update on the 18th, which is really random.

1111
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,560
That's on Tuesday to prohibit streaming of gambling sites that include slots, roulette

1112
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,960
dice games that aren't licensed in the US or other jurisdictions that provide sufficient

1113
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,400
consumer protection.

1114
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:56,440
These sites will include stake.com, rollbit.com, dual bits and roulette.com.

1115
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,400
However, they may identify others as they move forward.

1116
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:04,440
Sports betting, fantasy sports and poker are still going to be continuing to be allowed

1117
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,080
on the site.

1118
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,280
I do want to make I just want to make sure I'm very clear on something, too, because

1119
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,480
I'll get corrected on it.

1120
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,560
Regardless, I a couple things here.

1121
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:22,360
So a lot of this has to do with these crypto gambling sites and things that are a lot more

1122
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,160
shady.

1123
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:29,800
And what's really shady about it was that they were paying big name streamers, basically

1124
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:37,160
giving them free money on the house money, lots of big money to make big bets on these

1125
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,800
sites that for all I know now, I don't I don't know how to always find the scenes, but for

1126
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,040
all I know, could have been rigged to ensure that because, you know, you can tell a slot

1127
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,640
machine what the payout should be.

1128
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,040
So it could it could easily be rigged for a certain user to make sure that they are

1129
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:58,360
actually going to win on that money to entice other people to come into that site and spend

1130
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,080
a lot of money.

1131
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,880
That is the part that the CSGO gambling stuff.

1132
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,760
Yeah, exactly.

1133
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:10,200
That's the fucking shady part that no one anywhere, including Twitch should.

1134
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:16,200
And I'm surprised that these well, again, I'm not surprised, but you know that these

1135
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,280
big name streamers on Twitch are willing to tie their entire identity to it.

1136
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,920
And none of them are going down with the ship, which is fascinating to me.

1137
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,640
But y'all make your choices about who you want to watch.

1138
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,200
Cool, cool.

1139
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,720
There's a lot of other streams out there.

1140
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:37,080
Like I know like on YouTube, I have a friend, a really good friend of mine who loves gambling

1141
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:42,680
YouTube's and like so what she watches, she watches people go to Vegas and they film like

1142
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,160
with it.

1143
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,720
I didn't even know Vegas will let you do this, but apparently they will because it's all

1144
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,600
promo for them.

1145
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,080
They will film themselves playing slot machines and put it on.

1146
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:57,400
But they're walking into an establishment, playing the actual game and filming it and

1147
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,480
then, you know, putting it out for better and for worse, because usually it goes the

1148
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,920
other way onto YouTube.

1149
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,120
And I like there's big conventions for this stuff and all of it.

1150
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,880
But there's a huge key difference.

1151
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,080
It's not crypto.

1152
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:14,440
It's licensed in the US and it's the person that goes in and sits down at the machine

1153
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:20,280
is getting the exact same thing that anyone who comes in and walks in place that machine

1154
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:20,680
would get.

1155
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:28,760
So yeah, I've had someone made comments about how I don't know if they had gambling issues

1156
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,480
or someone they knew had gambling issues that like watching these streams because like not

1157
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:39,160
the obviously the crypto ones, but like the slots streams where they're not always winning.

1158
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:44,680
So it's not like, you know, it's kind of more reinforcing the fact that, yeah, you know,

1159
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:50,040
I may have these, you know, compulsions to play slots, but there's a good chance I won't

1160
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:54,920
win this stuff, like kind of bringing you back to reality, I guess, instead of, you

1161
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,360
know, a big dopamine hit that, oh, my God, you're going to make so much money off this

1162
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:58,760
stuff.

1163
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,200
Yeah, that's kind of a unique tech.

1164
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,440
I haven't heard that before.

1165
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,760
But yeah, I know some of the people behind all this stuff like Pokemon and stuff like

1166
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,000
that.

1167
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,720
I mean, let me get into it.

1168
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,080
There are strangers of controversy.

1169
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:13,800
Let's put it that way.

1170
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:18,440
There's a lot of comments in chat here over twitch.tv slash vog network.

1171
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:21,160
I want to get to some of these tape plays games.

1172
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,280
A lot of good insight here saying hate raids against 10 viewer count.

1173
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,040
People are irrelevant to Twitch.

1174
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:31,400
The site is so insanely top heavy that unless it's an issue impacting the top 5% of streamers,

1175
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,120
Twitch is going to give us platitudes and empty promises.

1176
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,560
Correct statement.

1177
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:38,840
It sucks.

1178
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,600
But that is the way it's been for a lot of things.

1179
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,240
YouTube is honestly no different in that regard.

1180
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:50,440
And a lot of these sites, you know, they're going to cater to the people that are having

1181
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,040
the most views and all of this stuff.

1182
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,880
And, you know, to hell with the 10 viewers and so forth, which sucks.

1183
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:02,040
It was only when all of those 10 viewer channels banded together and put their foot down and

1184
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,560
said, this shit needs to change.

1185
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:07,000
Now, Twitch, the Twitch finally came out and I'm talking about the hate raids, of course,

1186
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,160
finally came out and did something and, you know, showed the new tools and the changes

1187
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:17,880
they were doing with all of this that I hope we continue to hear more about how people

1188
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,840
can protect themselves from harassment on this platform at TwitchCon, because we know

1189
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:26,920
they're saving something under the curtain to unveil at the TwitchCon keynote.

1190
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,840
There's going to be some silly new feature that's going to make Twitch money because

1191
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,880
Twitch really needs to make money right now based on some of these other things Loki's

1192
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,360
going to get to.

1193
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,400
But what I think I'd love to hear more about and I'm sure DarkSakura would love to hear

1194
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,760
more about and lots of people out there would love to hear more about is, again, how can

1195
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:48,120
I what are the tools to better protect myself from harassment on this platform in order

1196
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,360
for me to invest myself more in it?

1197
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,760
So that would be what I'd love to hear in a keynote.

1198
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,920
Anyway, let me get some more comments from chat.

1199
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,400
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, but what if you have a podcast or talk show on Twitch where

1200
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,600
you're talking about gambling and crypto, giving people advice about gambling and crypto?

1201
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,960
Aren't those just as bad?

1202
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,680
Kind of, it's all in how it's framed.

1203
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,560
I would say kind of, yes, because you're glamorizing it.

1204
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:21,880
But are you taking the responsibility to say, while you're saying that, to also say, here

1205
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,600
are some issues, here are some things you can look for to see if you might be addicted

1206
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,480
to gambling.

1207
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,400
And I'm not talking about just throwing out a 1-800 ever and saying, if you or somebody

1208
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,320
have a loved one have a gambling problem, call 1-800.

1209
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:42,120
No, no, that is that is that there is no meat on that bone that you're throwing that crowd.

1210
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,080
Okay, there's not even meat on that bone.

1211
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,760
At least taking some steps on how to identify.

1212
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:57,720
And again, I would say the really big issue is the site paying the streamer to gamble

1213
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,000
and win so that other people are encouraged to do that.

1214
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,960
That was the big problem there.

1215
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,760
Buying reviews.

1216
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,560
Well, yeah, it's buying reviews.

1217
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,360
It really is.

1218
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:13,160
And I want to get to this where Tay plays games, says in chat, morality for those people

1219
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:17,160
tends to go out the window when they're quite literally making millions of dollars from

1220
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,080
streaming deals with crypto gambling.

1221
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,920
Not saying it's right or that I agree with it, but it's very understandable why people

1222
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,040
would sell their souls.

1223
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:31,400
And that's a very I'm trying to get the right word here, but it's a good point.

1224
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,480
And it's just one of those things where it's one of those some pills are hard to swallow

1225
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,400
and that is that is a hard one to swallow.

1226
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:43,080
But absolutely true is that everybody has a price and some are just showing theirs pretty

1227
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:43,880
openly with this.

1228
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,320
So that's legit.

1229
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,680
Tay also.

1230
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,200
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

1231
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:54,040
I'm just saying how much is your are your ethics worth?

1232
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:54,540
Yeah.

1233
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,720
Tay in chat also says, agreed, Rob.

1234
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,480
Solidarity means banding together to protect ourselves because we sure as fuck won't get

1235
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,520
it from Twitch, nor will we get support from the largest streamers.

1236
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,960
They won't rock the boat.

1237
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:11,400
So I'm glad, though, at least the small streamers are holding the large streamers accountable

1238
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,000
with a lot of this.

1239
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,960
With a lot of this.

1240
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,160
So and we should always continue to do so.

1241
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:22,680
So let's see, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, there are those coin machine games drop a

1242
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:27,880
coin and it pushed the other coins down on YouTube that are strangely pleasing to watch.

1243
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:35,480
But again, I feel like, again, doing YouTube's of those where you're walking into a Dave

1244
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,360
and Busters or whatever it is and it ethically you're all you're doing is you're just filming

1245
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,400
what you're doing anyway.

1246
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,880
You're not getting paid by the site to do it.

1247
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,960
The odds are no better or worse than any other person that would walk in there.

1248
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,640
So your odds are you're going to see defeat more than you see winning.

1249
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,480
I think there's a lot of stuff there where it's like, you know, I understand it.

1250
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:00,760
And actually, you know, again, a lot of people might scratch the itch, so to speak, by watching

1251
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,280
that stuff on YouTube as opposed to going down and spending a bunch of money themselves.

1252
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,960
So I see some things out of it that might be good as well.

1253
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,200
I see them as very, very different things.

1254
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:16,200
DGRMS and chat says on a side note, I know someone who lost his fiance over gambling.

1255
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:23,320
He kept spending his money on gotcha games, and that's a very good reminder, especially

1256
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:26,920
as we're talking about this Madden stuff at the top of the show and all this other stuff.

1257
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,840
Very good reminder that gambling is not just 777.

1258
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,520
There is much other different forms of gambling than just 777.

1259
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:41,480
And of course, you know, I'm speaking about a slot machine when, you know, that whole

1260
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:49,560
thing you're talking about Final Fantasy 7, where you get the all sevens and then I sure

1261
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,120
am not.

1262
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,000
Hi, Siri.

1263
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,960
Yeah, sorry.

1264
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:58,680
Sometimes I go on rants and Siri thinks I'm talking to her fill of nine, fill of nine

1265
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,040
and chat says money and profit are always prioritized.

1266
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,960
And especially when we hear and I got to let Loki get to these other parts of things going

1267
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,800
on with which when we hear about some of these, oh, yes, profit is very much prioritized

1268
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,200
right now.

1269
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,920
I want to get to some of these other comments in chat.

1270
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:17,720
Godets says I can't tell if it's because of the drama recently or because gambling agencies

1271
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:22,680
are looking to broadcast elsewhere, but I've been seeing ads for gambling websites recently

1272
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:28,120
when I never used to see them because people are starting to find loopholes with gambling

1273
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,520
laws is a huge part of it.

1274
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:34,840
And I think while it's still open season on this stuff until they lock some of it down,

1275
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:39,400
I believe we have propositions on the ballot here in California about very much this sort

1276
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:39,880
of thing.

1277
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,440
My gosh, yeah, we had.

1278
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,920
Yeah, they're doing some crazy claims about different things on.

1279
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,760
I've seen commercials because I'm watching Peacock now and they have commercials.

1280
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,120
It's everywhere.

1281
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,440
So let's see.

1282
01:09:54,440 --> 01:10:00,120
And TigerClaw in chat says gambling can really affect one's mental health.

1283
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,320
Absolutely.

1284
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:06,840
I mean, when we talk about gambling addiction, that is a mental health problem at the end

1285
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,040
of the day, right?

1286
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:12,360
And some people have to admit that they may have a problem.

1287
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:17,000
And again, it is much more than saying, you know, if you or a loved one have a gambling

1288
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,560
problem, call 1-800-STOP-GAMBLING or whatever the number is like in such a half-assed thing

1289
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,680
to try to cover your ass.

1290
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,760
I think you have to really talk about like if you're again to answer the question that

1291
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,760
came up earlier about what if I have a podcast that talks about this type of stuff you need

1292
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:36,200
to really focus and give long, hard insight as to what gambling might look like.

1293
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,560
So it's not just slot machines and Kino, you know?

1294
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,320
Well, and it's gotcha in this too.

1295
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,120
Absolutely.

1296
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,920
Card packs, booster packs, all of it.

1297
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,640
Yeah, all of it.

1298
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:56,760
I mean, anything that has some sort of random chance is technically a gamble.

1299
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:05,560
Um, but it's all in the way it's done.

1300
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:10,120
If it's, it's just, it's just really, really sticky.

1301
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:16,600
I mean, and if one wants to really, you know, go into it every day, you make a decision

1302
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:24,200
as a gamble, but those decisions aren't necessarily ones that are going to ruin your life and

1303
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:30,920
the lives of others, or, or especially you remember, um, when we did Neopets back in

1304
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:37,320
the day and Gaia online, those things were technically kid gambling, you know, they had

1305
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,960
some of those different aspects in it, you know?

1306
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:45,480
I mean, hell, uh, both of them had their own freaking stock markets practically.

1307
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,320
Speaking of kid gambling, this is where the chat comments are going right now.

1308
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:53,240
Tiger Claw in chat points out Pokemon Go is a gotcha as well.

1309
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:53,960
Absolutely.

1310
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,080
Absolutely.

1311
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:00,280
Um, Tay plays games says you guys didn't talk about it, but one other point, Twitch

1312
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,760
sorts by default from highest to lowest.

1313
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:07,720
And this site is visited by a lot of kids who literally see the top 10 streams and two

1314
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,960
or three of them are shady crypto slots.

1315
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,400
That type of content is very front and center to developing minds.

1316
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,240
Oh, that is an excellent point.

1317
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,960
Although, and I'm not, I'm not trying to, what about your point?

1318
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,040
I do want to make sure you're yes.

1319
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:25,000
That point I did notice though within the past week and a half or so that Twitch stopped

1320
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,160
showing me viewers high to low, even with my own following list.

1321
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:32,840
And now it shows me who you most want to watch.

1322
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,000
We think I hate that.

1323
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:35,800
I hate it.

1324
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,360
I hate it.

1325
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:36,920
I hate it.

1326
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,640
I only care about the people I'm following because I followed them for a reason.

1327
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,140
Yeah.

1328
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,920
So anyway, all right.

1329
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:50,440
We have talked about, oh, Tay plays game says I'm part of an experiment.

1330
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,200
It's not like that for everyone yet.

1331
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:58,040
Well, I'm open to experimenting, you know, I wish I would have been asked first, but

1332
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:58,520
that's all right.

1333
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:58,760
Okay.

1334
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:03,000
So I didn't know that wasn't open to everyone first, but again, I'm not trying to dismiss

1335
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,720
the point.

1336
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,640
I just try to, I have it right now.

1337
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,120
Yeah.

1338
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:11,240
I was thinking in my brain, I was like, is that why Twitch did that was to try to get

1339
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,040
away from that.

1340
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,440
But I sort of think at the end of the day, especially if you're new to Twitch and you

1341
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:20,600
haven't established that pattern of what you like, then of course they're going to show

1342
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:26,040
you the top streams and a lot of it's going to fall into this whole type of thing.

1343
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:32,440
So I do have to say, though, that the streams that's been showing me lately are people

1344
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,880
that I'm already following.

1345
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,640
So maybe it is working.

1346
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,040
I don't know.

1347
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,040
Derek JH in chat says, but with my special system, I can't lose.

1348
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,240
It's like free money.

1349
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:46,600
Oh, well, you must be in the same program that XQC did I name names that those folks

1350
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:52,280
are in that are playing those games online that basically the house is giving them money

1351
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,480
and the house is letting them win.

1352
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,240
You must be in that same program.

1353
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:55,880
Congrats.

1354
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:00,200
He's the good guy because he's giving back half of the money that that guy scammed the

1355
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:00,920
other people out of.

1356
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,000
So he's the good guy, right?

1357
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,640
Anyway, there's been more Twitch drama this week.

1358
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,720
I mean, that's enough Twitch drama to fill a week.

1359
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,320
But let's let's talk about.

1360
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,240
But wait, there's more.

1361
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:13,720
There's more.

1362
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:23,320
So then Twitch decided to come out and tell everybody about their brand new revenue split.

1363
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,280
That's right.

1364
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:30,680
So now what they're going to be doing as well is they're going to be updating the monetization

1365
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,520
of some of their larger partners.

1366
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:41,720
Um, I think it's really right now, some of the partners have a special 70 30 revenue

1367
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,520
split right now.

1368
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,480
But that's going to change to 50 50.

1369
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:52,600
What they're saying is they're basically going to the ones that have that special, I guess,

1370
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,600
deal right now it's going to be for the first 100,000 that they make are going to be 70 30.

1371
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,280
Then afterwards, it's going to be 50 50.

1372
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,240
And then everything else is going to be 50 50.

1373
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:06,040
The reason why they're losing people, the reason why and this is the best part, this

1374
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,720
is some mental gymnastics for you.

1375
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:13,080
The reason why they say they need to drop that split and take more of that money, by

1376
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:18,440
the way, also pushing more ads on the platform that also hurt people finding new streamers

1377
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:24,120
is because Amazon Web Services is expensive.

1378
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:33,960
And it's just too expensive for them to run a company that uses Amazon Web Services.

1379
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,320
Because that that company Amazon just charges them too much.

1380
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,000
Wait, hold on a second.

1381
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,680
No, no, they're owned by Amazon.

1382
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,240
So that doesn't make any goddamn sense.

1383
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:50,200
So they're basically saying that, you know, Daddy company is charging me too much money

1384
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,880
for this company to run.

1385
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,380
What?

1386
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,360
Like, that doesn't make any sense.

1387
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,160
But that's the excuse is that it costs too much to run.

1388
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:03,960
So their revenues, they tried to put out that stat that was like somebody who streams for

1389
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:11,960
what was it for 100 concurrent viewers, 200 hours would cost them like 1500 bucks or so.

1390
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:17,960
I don't know what the what the number was more than that it was it was for 100 concurrent

1391
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:25,240
streamer or 100 concurrent viewers for 200 hours a month are more than a thousand costs

1392
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,720
more than $1,000 per month for them.

1393
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,560
Let's put it this way.

1394
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:37,720
If you are a streamer, that's making that's that's putting out 200 hours worth of streams

1395
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:38,360
in a month.

1396
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,000
That's a lot of that's a lot of stream time.

1397
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,360
And you're holding 100 concurrent concurrent viewers through them.

1398
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:50,440
You are by far in the top percentage, probably decimal fractional percentage of Twitch and

1399
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,000
crypto gambling sites probably want to partner with you.

1400
01:16:54,040 --> 01:17:00,920
Like that's a lot of money you would probably be making a ton of money from just streaming

1401
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:06,280
in general, that they would be taking a portion of anyways, yes, telling me that you can't

1402
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:13,480
pay $100 or $1,000 to run that, that that's too much for you, which I don't believe because

1403
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,120
Amazon's a trillion dollar company.

1404
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,480
And like, I just don't believe that.

1405
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:19,960
I'm sorry.

1406
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:20,680
It just doesn't.

1407
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,480
Who are you trying to convince here?

1408
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:24,760
Here's the thing.

1409
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:30,440
And did your own mess and chat says if you're pulling 100 K a month, the 70 30 split ain't

1410
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,640
going to break your bank.

1411
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,760
It's actually it's 100 K on a rotating calendar year.

1412
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:38,520
So but that's still you know, you're talking about people that I have 100 and that's just

1413
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,880
what they're making off Twitch.

1414
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:44,520
That doesn't count any type of other licensing deals, sponsorship deals, merchandise deals,

1415
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:50,600
direct PayPal donations and things of that sort, convention appearances for some of them

1416
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,960
and those sorts of things.

1417
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,480
So it's 100 K on a rotating.

1418
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:56,680
I mean, but that's still that's a decent chunk of change, right?

1419
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,480
And here's the thing.

1420
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:02,040
If you're pulling 100 K a month, the 70 30 split ain't going to break your bank.

1421
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:05,800
And there is a part of me that certainly lands on that side of the fence where it's like,

1422
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,800
well, it's hard to feel super innocent.

1423
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:08,920
Isn't this interesting?

1424
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:13,560
My how the tables have turned because now here's something where the partners could

1425
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,720
really use the little people in this fight.

1426
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:28,440
Anyway, but I think where this bothers people is there were a lot of people at that affiliate

1427
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:36,280
level that wanted to grow into 70 30 and had those dreams of getting bigger and so forth

1428
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:41,560
and so on that now they're not going to be able to do because, oh, Twitch is starting

1429
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,160
to pull back a little bit.

1430
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:48,920
And I think, again, another big problem here is optics, optics, messaging, messaging.

1431
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,560
And very clearly, this statement that has come out.

1432
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:59,720
Has this issues was not run by any sort of audience that was going to give an honest

1433
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:05,560
feedback and honest assessment of what was going on with this statement and so forth.

1434
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:11,160
Because a smarter way to have rolled out a message like this would have been we're going

1435
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:17,160
to be changing the split here, but here's another way that you can earn money or here's

1436
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,480
something else we're going to be putting in place.

1437
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,800
Well, they're upping their ad revenue split.

1438
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:28,520
So you get 55 percent of that now, which is beans from the vast majority of people.

1439
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:34,760
And the only way you do that is to opt into three minutes of ads in an hour, which I think

1440
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:38,040
you can time the ad yourself.

1441
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:41,960
Most people are too lazy to do so, so they run the automatic ads.

1442
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,880
I've gotten on this boat before.

1443
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:49,480
I don't want to repeat myself too much, but I'm just going to say automatic ads on a small

1444
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:54,920
channel, you are kneecapping yourself severely to growth.

1445
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:00,280
Huge difference, huge, I want to make sure I'm clear, huge difference between automatic

1446
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,840
ads and I need to go poop.

1447
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,360
I'm going to run an ad while I'm pooping.

1448
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:09,880
Because with an automatic ad, you're missing content and I can't tell you how annoyed.

1449
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,040
Nothing gets me to turn a channel off faster.

1450
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,400
And there are some big streamers that do this, even ones that play Dead by Daylight.

1451
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,240
I'll be watching and they're right at the end of the match.

1452
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,600
It's like, oddly enough, it's all killer streams I've seen do this.

1453
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,840
Watching a match and are they about to get a forehook?

1454
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:30,600
Oh, and then an ad jumps in, cuts off the rest of the match and comes back to the screen

1455
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,080
where everybody's going and it's the wrap up of the match.

1456
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:37,240
So I completely missed the climax of the match because the automatic ad, I turn those

1457
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:37,880
streams off.

1458
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:44,360
I unfollow them if I'm unfollowing the streamer, because that is garbage content that they're

1459
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,240
putting out.

1460
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,440
And that is the truth.

1461
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,400
Experimented with the automatic ads.

1462
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,800
Oh, you experimented with them?

1463
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,080
I experimented with it.

1464
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:58,120
I did it for like a month because I figured a month would be enough time to see how well

1465
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:58,920
it worked.

1466
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:06,440
I did the recommended thing to get the 55% revenue, whatever that Twitch was preaching.

1467
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:12,440
And I found it to be more annoying than anything else.

1468
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:18,600
So I'm doing another experiment right now where I'm doing a 30-second ad once an hour

1469
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,160
to see if it's any better for people.

1470
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,240
Because honestly enough, I'm going to forget.

1471
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:37,320
Um, and so far, I think it's been a little bit less obtrusive, although I will sometimes

1472
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,200
go ahead and just run one to run one instead.

1473
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:48,360
But I really did not like that, that three minutes every hour bullshit.

1474
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,400
I thought that it really annoyed people.

1475
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:56,920
People would complain about the ads more to the point where I'm like, yes, I know, stop

1476
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:01,880
telling me, you know, and now I'm there.

1477
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:07,720
There's a benefit to having automatic ads if it's not something that you would likely

1478
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,920
remember to do.

1479
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:14,200
But I have mine set at the very bare minimum, and I'm going to see exactly how it works.

1480
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:21,320
While I completely respect whatever choices you want to make with your content, I just

1481
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:28,040
even with the short ads, really think about what content you might be sacrificing to do

1482
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:31,000
that because we talked about earlier, how much is your content worth?

1483
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,760
And I just testing it out.

1484
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,600
Yeah, that's all I'm doing is testing it.

1485
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,720
I would be curious if you look at the revenue you make off that I think you're really going

1486
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,600
to assess the same worth it just about nothing.

1487
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:44,600
I mean, to be perfectly honest, I've switched it back about two weeks ago.

1488
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:50,840
And I don't see any point I would it's like you were saying earlier, I'd rather run the

1489
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:54,840
ad when I go to the bathroom, you know, exactly all the time.

1490
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,680
Well, it's a good idea to just get stretch and hydrate once an hour.

1491
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:01,320
Anyway, it's a good reminder to you to do that, right?

1492
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:07,080
Well, I mean, this is why I stream when I do because I, I start at four, five o'clock,

1493
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,760
I go feed the cat, you know?

1494
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:09,260
Yeah.

1495
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,280
And but I wanted to see how it worked.

1496
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:19,080
I figured giving myself a few weeks of of testing it to see how it is in the real world.

1497
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:25,800
I would rather participate in it and form an opinion based on my, my experience, then

1498
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:31,080
to, I guess, read and guess about it, I would rather see it in action.

1499
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:34,760
And now that I've seen it in action, I can flat out say, yeah, shit.

1500
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:40,760
And thank you for reminding me, I meant to change mine back this week.

1501
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,920
Nothing wrong with an educated perspective.

1502
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,640
I'm not gonna exactly I want on that.

1503
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:55,640
I'm a firm believer that, I mean, I think that you can form a better opinion when you're

1504
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:02,360
in the situation, you know, rather than just on looking at the straight details of it.

1505
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:05,240
And I wanted to see how is this working?

1506
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,000
I'm not a big streamer.

1507
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,840
It's not gonna affect me that badly to test it out.

1508
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:15,720
Um, but honestly, it was it was it was shit.

1509
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:17,800
It was really shit.

1510
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,080
It was annoying.

1511
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:25,320
And I would watch because whenever I'm playing, I keep my dashboard open so that I can see

1512
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:32,120
when the ads are coming up and when my pre the pre roll is disabled and all of that.

1513
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:38,440
And it was just as easy for me to set it when I got the warning about about pre roll coming

1514
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:38,920
up.

1515
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:39,980
Yeah.

1516
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:44,680
Now going to some of the comments from chat as she 100 Matt says, I think going from 70 30

1517
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,320
to 50 50 is a big shift on short notice.

1518
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,840
Folks have made this into a career.

1519
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,040
If your employer is telling you they're going to be taking out for more of your paycheck,

1520
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,040
don't be surprised if your employees leave.

1521
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:59,160
And I think a big thing I'm hearing everywhere right now is diversify, diversify, diversify.

1522
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:03,480
Do not put all of your eggs into twitches basket, which is exactly what which does not

1523
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:07,960
need people doing right now if they really are in these, you know, dire financial straits.

1524
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,240
And that goes back to the comments.

1525
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,440
Somebody had talked about a billion.

1526
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:15,000
Oh, as Joe and Hunter Matt said to play devil's advocate, Amazon spent a lot of money, 1 billion

1527
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,120
to acquire Twitch.

1528
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:20,280
If the service by itself is not returning on that investment as readily, why not reduce

1529
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:20,920
the split?

1530
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:24,600
If Twitch is Amazon's weakest revenue, just speculating, but don't know for sure.

1531
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,600
Why not try to get more out of it?

1532
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:33,720
It's just all of the money arguments are really hard to look at when you look at how much

1533
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:37,080
Jeff Bezos puts in his pocket every minute.

1534
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:42,360
Versus from nothing is pretty, pretty bullshit.

1535
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:49,800
That's that's that's the very hard pill to swallow is that that's what makes all of this

1536
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:54,920
like it look like look like bullshit and all is just because meanwhile, Jeff Bezos is still

1537
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:55,880
pocketing how much?

1538
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,200
And I'm supposed to feel sorry for the bitch, I don't.

1539
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:09,000
The thing is, is that if they expected to make a lot of money on people playing video

1540
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,800
games, they shouldn't have.

1541
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:16,440
They should have just stuck with our cloud service and not deal with Twitch.

1542
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:19,640
Twitch is kind of a niche.

1543
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:20,520
I'm going to say it.

1544
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:26,040
I mean, with as big as the as the events that they have and some of the streamers that they

1545
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:30,120
have, it's still, you know, it's not something I would have expected to be.

1546
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,960
A very big moneymaker.

1547
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,240
I'm just going to be honest.

1548
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:33,740
Yeah.

1549
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,840
Quest Buster in chat says a streamer I sometimes watch has shifted more of their effort to

1550
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:43,320
making YouTube content after one of their videos went viral for them and started generating

1551
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,280
more revenue for them.

1552
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,760
They get a few hundred viewers per stream.

1553
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:50,280
Now they put a lot of work into making YouTube videos based on topics they want to cover

1554
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:53,160
and get a solid return and haven't been shy about saying that.

1555
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,720
Yeah, YouTube makes me a lot more money at this point than Twitch.

1556
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:57,880
But here's one of the problems.

1557
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:03,640
YouTube could also go ass up and do something that is not.

1558
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:07,960
We've seen them do this before with copyright strikes, banning channels that shouldn't

1559
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:11,480
be banned, silencing, shifting revenue streams.

1560
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,960
YouTube is not some fucking holy land.

1561
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,760
Let's get that 100% clear.

1562
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,560
YouTube has problems all of its own.

1563
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:25,880
So if you think the grass is greener over on YouTube, have fun when you take that Astro

1564
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,800
turf injury in fall fall hard.

1565
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:33,320
Well, I'm just saying right now with YouTube, they're doing I mean, and we're we can only

1566
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,200
talk about the present.

1567
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,360
I mean, obviously, we don't know what the future is going to hold.

1568
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:42,600
But right now, the moves that they're making are seem to be benefiting content creators.

1569
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,920
So they're adding a way to monetize shorts now.

1570
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:52,840
And they're allowing, you know, ways to get more into a partner program with with the

1571
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,880
shorts as well.

1572
01:27:53,880 --> 01:28:00,840
They're introducing a new music monetization system that you'll be able to license music,

1573
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:06,120
like, and even with the shorts, you can use licensed music in your shorts.

1574
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:10,040
So they're they're making it a little bit easier in that sense, you know, to do that.

1575
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:15,400
Honestly, I probably will be streaming from YouTube, because Twitch does.

1576
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,880
It's not really a growth avenue for me.

1577
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:25,400
I think I think I have a better chance of getting revenue from YouTube than I do from

1578
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,200
Twitch.

1579
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,640
And that's totally fair.

1580
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,560
You got to do what speaks to you.

1581
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,200
Absolutely.

1582
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:35,880
Let's see a entertainment says they monetize shorts to compete with TikTok and Instagram.

1583
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:36,440
Yep.

1584
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,800
Bobby Black Wolf says to be fair, Loki's audience is already on YouTube.

1585
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:40,840
So makes sense to stream.

1586
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:41,880
They're also true.

1587
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,440
Let's see other comments here.

1588
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:49,320
Take place game says Twitch is giving us numbers based on Amazon Web Services, which they

1589
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,640
themselves fucking own is insulting.

1590
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:55,640
Business wise, those costs are 100% written off as operating losses.

1591
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,960
So Amazon can reduce their taxes anyway.

1592
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,200
Oh, 100% don't pay any tax.

1593
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:08,840
The messaging was so bad in how they delivered this news so bad that it really makes you

1594
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:13,320
wonder if they even bothered to proofread the stinking product.

1595
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:18,920
Godets and chat says I will say candidly, this sort of thing talking about a response

1596
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,640
to fifth dream saying let's demand a return to Justin TV.

1597
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,440
I will say candidly, this sort of thing screams opportunity.

1598
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:28,200
YouTube's been falling flat on streaming service improvements, although they are trying.

1599
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:31,080
I wonder if any other service can come around to eat Twitch.

1600
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:35,960
Well, thank God Facebook has finally realized they aren't it because that was that was the

1601
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,600
one service I did not want in this fucking.

1602
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:39,640
Yeah.

1603
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:45,080
And unfortunately, we need to have like Twitch to survive, too, because competition is the

1604
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,560
only thing that's going to make these things better because the Twitch goes under.

1605
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:51,160
Well, all that nice stuff with YouTube we were just talking about.

1606
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,040
Bye bye.

1607
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:56,120
And it was like there's a couple comments in chat talking about Mixer.

1608
01:29:56,120 --> 01:30:01,720
And I agree, like Mixer, I'm still a little surprised at how Mixer kind of finished.

1609
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:05,720
I mean, yes, I guess there were management leadership problems at Mixer, but it's one

1610
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:13,400
of those things where it's like, dang, like Mixer in the mix right now would really change

1611
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,600
this game a lot.

1612
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:18,840
I hope Microsoft, to some degree, still recognizes that.

1613
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:25,720
Oh, for the record, I just turned off ads manager

1614
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:30,840
and they gave me a big old survey to fill out because they want to know why.

1615
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:37,480
And I think it's very interesting that that they're taking the feedback on it, like even

1616
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:40,760
to the point, oh, you might win an Amazon gift card.

1617
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:41,800
I'm like, I could use it right now.

1618
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,560
I need all my, you know, cosplay stuff.

1619
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:47,960
But the other thing on there, though, that I wish that they would switch to if they're

1620
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:52,360
going to do ads are the stream display ads that they have.

1621
01:30:53,640 --> 01:31:00,120
Where your window gets a little bit smaller and you have a little banner underneath it

1622
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,400
and it's not obtrusive.

1623
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,680
You're not missing content.

1624
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,520
Yeah, absolutely.

1625
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,240
I want to get one more comment here from TayPlaysGames.

1626
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:14,280
Now I got to move on because it's already an hour and a half in the show.

1627
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,120
So we got to pick it up with these other news stories.

1628
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,000
But this is good stuff.

1629
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I'm not, you know, we talk about what needs to be talked about.

1630
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:26,760
TayPlaysGames says Facebook gaming was embarrassing, but I know multiple queer streamers were offered

1631
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,680
one year Facebook gaming contracts.

1632
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:32,360
They got their bag, held their tongues for a year, and now are back on Twitch.

1633
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,880
I say make that paper, babes.

1634
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,400
Absolutely.

1635
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,280
Make that coin.

1636
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:40,520
I mean, I'm not watching, but, you know, profit off other people do it.

1637
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:43,080
Like, you know, take the moment.

1638
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:47,000
Honestly, I still wouldn't have done it because I don't want to support Facebook.

1639
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,480
Yeah.

1640
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:49,480
Well, everybody's got a price.

1641
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,720
I'm speaking for me anyway.

1642
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,560
Would I would I have shut my fucking mouth?

1643
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,320
For the right price.

1644
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,720
So all right.

1645
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,120
Well, yeah.

1646
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,680
But then again, when's the last time I looked at my face?

1647
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,760
But let's be clear, it's a high price.

1648
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,560
Okay.

1649
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,060
Yeah.

1650
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:06,040
All right.

1651
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:11,880
Like if they're going to pay me enough to be off work for a year and pay all my medical

1652
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:13,640
bills, then yeah, I'll do that.

1653
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,400
I'll take a leave of absence from work.

1654
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,520
I'll stream for a year and then I'll shit talk them after.

1655
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:23,080
If if I suddenly come around and I start saying, oh, I love Facebook.

1656
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,200
Facebook's a great thing.

1657
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,120
I can't wait to do more stuff.

1658
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,720
I'm going to partner up with Facebook.

1659
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:29,880
One of two things happened, I guarantee you.

1660
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,520
Number one, somebody paid me a lot of money.

1661
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:35,160
Number two, Zuckerberg is no longer the CEO.

1662
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,440
One of those two things happened.

1663
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,560
Blink once if they have you blink twice.

1664
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,480
All right.

1665
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:47,560
You know, what would be funny is to take that money and then put it toward the anti-Facebook

1666
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:48,200
legislation.

1667
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,080
Hey, all this money you gave us.

1668
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:55,000
Yeah, we're going to use it to piss in your cornflakes, Facebook.

1669
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:55,500
Just saying.

1670
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,800
All right, let's move on.

1671
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,720
Let's talk about some other gaming news.

1672
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,800
We may have to touch on some of these a little bit faster just because we're already an hour

1673
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:04,840
and a half into the show.

1674
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,000
I want to get to this next story, which has to do.

1675
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,600
And by the way, great discussion, everyone.

1676
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:13,480
And I invite further discussion over on Twitter at twitter.com slash O L R.

1677
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:20,760
Or you can also send us an email at participate at orange lounge radio.com.

1678
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:24,200
Again, that's participate at orange lounge radio.com.

1679
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:30,840
So moving on, let's talk about the Xbox Series X and a change that happened there.

1680
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:34,840
The digital rights management for Xbox one games.

1681
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:40,200
So if you have no access to playing Xbox one games, because it's trying to do an online

1682
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:45,800
check to balance the digital rights management issues, then you no longer have to worry about

1683
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:48,040
that with the latest Series X update.

1684
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:53,880
This was confirmed by engineering lead Eda Marie and a tweet saying, yes, this is true.

1685
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:59,160
Since the 2206 update, we examined data since Series X and S launch and determined that

1686
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:03,800
the online compatibility check isn't needed in the vast majority of cases for Xbox one

1687
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:04,440
discs.

1688
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:09,800
Some games may still need to be updated online after install to ensure the best experience.

1689
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:13,640
And that's, you know, we're talking about games with gigantic patches, like, say, No

1690
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,000
Man's Sky, right?

1691
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,400
Like that game just isn't going to play the same at all if you don't update it.

1692
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,080
So there is that.

1693
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:23,480
Let's see.

1694
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,240
I think that's really all I want to say.

1695
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:32,760
There are some other exceptions, like Forza Horizon 5 or Halo Infinite, because the discs

1696
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,920
don't contain the full version of the game.

1697
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:39,480
So you still need an internet connection to actually get the full versions of those games.

1698
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:43,720
And we've seen that happen a lot where, you know, what does a disc really mean anymore?

1699
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:44,200
Right.

1700
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,800
So, yeah.

1701
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,600
What's the list for this Xbox one games, though?

1702
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:50,920
Yes, I thought I made that clear.

1703
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,600
This is just for Xbox one games.

1704
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:57,000
This does not affect any Series X thing that's always online.

1705
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:00,440
I don't know how many of those really require always.

1706
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:04,280
I mean, with so many games as a service these days and so forth, I don't know how many of

1707
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:05,960
them really require always online.

1708
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:10,360
But it is this is specifically addressing Xbox one related issues.

1709
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,300
Yeah.

1710
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:14,360
All right, moving on.

1711
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,560
This is an interesting story.

1712
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,200
Dark Sakura.

1713
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:23,800
Yeah, well, and you know how I like to look into the bigger world of video games and how

1714
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:26,440
it affects, you know, social elements.

1715
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:37,800
So the Department of Homeland Security has given an almost $700,000 grant to terrorism

1716
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:43,160
and security researchers to investigate radicalization through video games.

1717
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:49,640
They're going to the Middlebury Institute Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism

1718
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:57,160
or CTEC, which is a nonprofit organization called Take This and another company that's

1719
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:00,680
looking to curb toxic behavior called Logically.

1720
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:06,520
And I'll go ahead and read the quote from the grant announcement.

1721
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:11,160
Over the past decade, video games have increasingly become focal points of social activity and

1722
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:14,280
identity creation for adolescents and young adults.

1723
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:19,080
Relationships made and fostered within game ecosystems routinely cross over into the real

1724
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:22,520
world and are impactful parts of local communities.

1725
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:27,400
Correspondingly, extremists have used video games and targeted video game communities

1726
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:31,960
for activities ranging from propaganda creation to terrorist mobilization and training.

1727
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:38,280
I'm going to take a sidestep on that one because I have been following the keffles situation

1728
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,880
very, very actively.

1729
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:48,600
And I honestly think that this goes into it with, you know, Kiwi farms.

1730
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:55,640
They were, you know, sort of fostering those environments on their site and targeting a

1731
01:36:55,640 --> 01:37:02,760
lot of different streamers, different people that were active in the video game community

1732
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,520
that are also activists.

1733
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:09,560
So I think that that's a related item.

1734
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:10,920
We've seen it very recently.

1735
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:20,680
So one of the goals is that they want to monitor and evaluate extremist activities, and then

1736
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:29,240
they want to train others for monitoring, detection, and prevention of, as I say, extremist

1737
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:36,200
exploitation in gaming spaces for community managers, multiplayer designers, lore developers,

1738
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,560
mechanic designers, and trust and safety professionals.

1739
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:52,280
Um, they are looking at all kinds of different video game studios, you know, from big to

1740
01:37:52,280 --> 01:38:00,200
small that don't really understand how their games could be exploited for radicalization.

1741
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:07,240
In fact, and then we've even seen this too, going back to the situation with Kiwi farms.

1742
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:13,240
Um, white nationalists have been digging into gaming space.

1743
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:24,520
There's groups on Steam that are openly neo-Nazi and, you know, glorifying, you know,

1744
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,840
domestic terrorism, you know, like school shooters and the like.

1745
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:35,400
When I look at this, though, I'm kind of like, I don't think this is the video game's fault.

1746
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,840
This is the internet's fault.

1747
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,840
This is internet radicalization.

1748
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:39,160
All right.

1749
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:43,960
And I think that they're dealing with one of the layers of it.

1750
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,120
And I kind of see their approach on this one.

1751
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:51,160
What they're wanting to do is like, while Steam has banned a lot of these groups,

1752
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:54,120
these people want to go further and get them where they start.

1753
01:38:55,880 --> 01:39:02,680
They actually did a presentation at this year's Game Developers Conference

1754
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:09,560
um, that their focus is going to be on the white nationalism supremacy front.

1755
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:19,720
Um, because of a lot of the more racially motivated mass shootings, like the one in Buffalo.

1756
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:23,240
Um, because that was broadcast on Twitch,

1757
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:30,920
live with people dying and being injured on stream.

1758
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:40,360
And I think that it's like you said, it's not just, you know, video games,

1759
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:47,640
but I think that some of the online spaces around it have been hotbeds for negativity.

1760
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:54,680
You know, we're, we're seeing, you know, just, just in general, you know, I mean,

1761
01:39:55,160 --> 01:40:01,080
the hate raids aside, I've been in my friends channels and had people come in and start

1762
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:08,360
harassing them for their, uh, their sexual and gender orientation.

1763
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:17,240
Um, I've actually had someone come in my channel and, and, uh, start spouting, uh, Nazi rhetoric.

1764
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:21,800
Just because I have the Jewish label up on my channel.

1765
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:29,000
I've had people come into my channel and tell me that I need hormone treatment because I'm ace.

1766
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:38,120
Um, completely unsolicited, which I mean, 90% of it is unsolicited.

1767
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:45,880
But, you know, for some of our, you know, my, uh, streamers of color, some of my friends,

1768
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:51,320
they've, they've said there's a whole lot worse, of course, that comes in

1769
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:53,880
and on their channel.

1770
01:40:53,880 --> 01:41:05,080
And, and I think the big thing, you know, on it is that it is something I'm glad that they're

1771
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:09,240
looking at the sources and how it comes together.

1772
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:15,080
Because I think if you can dismantle the, how the, the source of it,

1773
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:22,440
you know, then to use, you know, the, the, the Hydra, you know, uh, analogy,

1774
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:25,560
you know, you cut off one head and five more spawn.

1775
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:27,720
Well, that's, you have to cut off the base.

1776
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:29,800
That's what they're talking about in chat right now.

1777
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,720
You know, talking about things like 4chan.

1778
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:35,480
So going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

1779
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:40,760
says there are thousands of these site and platforms that are just cesspools and recruitment

1780
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:41,400
centers.

1781
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:46,120
For instance, if federal agencies don't have a massive team monitoring 4chan, like a hawk,

1782
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:47,240
then they're doing it wrong.

1783
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:52,120
But if they ever shut down 4chan, thousands of other ones will pop up in its place.

1784
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:55,720
So diversifying their counterintelligence will hopefully stop more attacks.

1785
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:00,280
I also think what Tay says here is a huge, important point.

1786
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:05,240
And again, why, why my brain, like, I understand why they're looking at the gaming culture,

1787
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,960
but my brain says this is an internet problem.

1788
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:09,400
And this is huge.

1789
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,600
What Tay is saying in chat.

1790
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:16,360
Take place game says I'm less concerned about video games than I am about YouTube algorithms.

1791
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:22,120
And I actually would personally, I would say any social media algorithm pushing out far

1792
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:27,320
right content to kids, because this is something Facebook is also extremely guilty of is pushing

1793
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:33,080
maybe less the targeting kids part, but bubbling that garbage and misinformation up.

1794
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:40,760
And it's, you know, there's on all sides to they put it's that echo chamber of confirmation

1795
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,480
bias.

1796
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:41,980
Yes.

1797
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:49,640
So that's that's what needs to be looked at is how we're bubbling the extremities to the

1798
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,140
top.

1799
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:57,800
And yeah, it's that's that's a bigger problem than any video game, in my opinion.

1800
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:03,160
Well, and I think though, that they have to start somewhere.

1801
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:10,600
And we, I think by, I'm not saying that it's right to target one community over another.

1802
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:17,480
But, you know, they say that the, the, the bent nail gets hammered down first.

1803
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:26,040
And I think that, of course, video games have often been the scapegoat of many of the people

1804
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:26,540
in charge.

1805
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:33,020
But the fact that we're actually seeing that they have evidence to support that this is a part

1806
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:36,780
of it, then I think they have to start somewhere.

1807
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:37,180
Yeah.

1808
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:47,020
And on top of that, though, logically is actually a pretty, pretty good nonprofit that I'm not

1809
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:51,580
nonprofit, but just company in general trying to curb the toxic behavior.

1810
01:43:51,580 --> 01:44:02,220
And also to add to this, I got an email from Intel about a service that they have to, to

1811
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:09,980
combat online toxicity in online gaming and in gaming chats.

1812
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:14,300
I joined in on that, although I haven't really seen anything more from it.

1813
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:25,580
Um, but I think that it's also, it's sad that the government needs to step in on something

1814
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:29,900
that people should just be putting down themselves.

1815
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:36,700
You know, that's why I supported Kefl's attempts with, with Kiwi Farms and now they're gone

1816
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:38,620
because a lot of us spoke up about it.

1817
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:43,180
And I think that we need to be the louder voices, the voices of reason.

1818
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:46,380
And, you know, call these people out.

1819
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:48,460
Know what you're doing is not good.

1820
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:53,420
You need to, you need to SDF you and, you know, go get that tree trunk out of your ass.

1821
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:55,900
Or maybe you need something up your ass.

1822
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:56,460
I don't know.

1823
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:57,740
To this story's point.

1824
01:44:57,740 --> 01:45:05,500
Well, let's, let's not resort to that, but let's, you know, to this story's point, like,

1825
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:12,700
and with the video game stuff, at least these things that happen on Twitch and so forth

1826
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:16,940
in the gaming community and on Steam and in the space, at least they're trackable.

1827
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:19,180
At least you can see them at least.

1828
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:23,660
And so, so maybe I do understand why it does lure the government to that sort of space

1829
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:27,180
to be able to actually see it and monitor it a little more effectively.

1830
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:31,500
Because when I'm out playing Ingress and a car comes by and somebody leans out the

1831
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:35,900
window and says faggot really loud out the window, that's not something that the government

1832
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:36,940
can easily track.

1833
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:39,020
And if I complain about that, that's happening.

1834
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:41,980
That's just me being a baby and I need to grow a thicker skin.

1835
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:45,100
And I'm sorry if you don't like that word, but I don't like that word either.

1836
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,620
And I especially don't like it when it's yelled at me as it was in that situation that

1837
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:49,980
happened in the past couple months.

1838
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:52,140
Like I'm not talking about something that happened to me as a kid.

1839
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:56,540
For me, that's something that happened to me as a 40 year old man out playing, you know,

1840
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:59,980
Ingress and tapping my phone, which looks like Pokemon go.

1841
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:03,020
So therefore I must be a lesser than that.

1842
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:07,260
And that, and that's the issue when it really comes into stop being shits.

1843
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:11,740
But unfortunately, if I yell back, don't be a shit, it's not heard.

1844
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:22,460
Well, and the, the thing about it is that there, this is all coming back to a, trying

1845
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:23,420
to think of the way to say it.

1846
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:27,740
Cause I'm not going to say that it's a mental health thing, but I think it's the way that

1847
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:33,420
people are being raised that there is this, and it's a very American thing.

1848
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:38,620
I mean, I'm not saying that it's, it's isolated to America, but it is a very, very American

1849
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:49,660
thing where if you don't fit in with this one mold, and I'm going to say it right now.

1850
01:46:49,660 --> 01:47:02,540
The quote default is white male, straight, cisgender, Christian, boring, vanilla person.

1851
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:03,100
You know what I mean?

1852
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:06,540
You know, that is default.

1853
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:12,780
And this is something that as a female oriented person, I have grown up with my entire life

1854
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:18,220
being told that I can't do something because it's something that a guy does, you know,

1855
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:22,060
or, or that I'm going to be perceived a certain way.

1856
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:25,740
And I'm sure that you have just like what that other person you've experienced that

1857
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:32,860
way, it's society reinforcing the stereotype and it needs to start at home.

1858
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:33,360
Yep.

1859
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:35,580
It needs to start at home.

1860
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:41,180
It needs parents to be better to their kids than their parents were to them.

1861
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:41,680
Yeah.

1862
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:43,580
They need to break the mold.

1863
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:46,300
And, you know, thanks for the kind words and chat.

1864
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:47,660
I see people saying, sorry, that happened.

1865
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:48,140
That's fucked up.

1866
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:49,580
And so I do appreciate that.

1867
01:47:49,580 --> 01:47:54,460
But like anyone who's different as dark star point out, anyone who has any element that's

1868
01:47:54,460 --> 01:48:00,060
against the norm, quote unquote has experienced something similar and it sucks.

1869
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:03,100
And there's some that experience it a lot more often.

1870
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:08,220
And there's some that, you know, I, I just, it's, it's a problem.

1871
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:13,740
That's much bigger than what's, what, what's the video, what's the video game that's

1872
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:16,620
causing people to just, just do terrible things.

1873
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:19,660
It's, it's, it's no video game people.

1874
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:27,020
No, it's people, but they're filtering it into games that have things to do with their

1875
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:28,940
viewpoint, you know?

1876
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:31,260
And I mean, but here's like a prime example.

1877
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:39,740
If you go say on a running webpage, tips for men learning to run, you know, have a anti

1878
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:44,780
chafe cream, you know, pick a good route, have good shoes.

1879
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:49,340
Women carry a whistle, use your headphones, have mace with you.

1880
01:48:50,780 --> 01:48:51,820
Don't run at night.

1881
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:55,900
You know, these double standards.

1882
01:48:55,980 --> 01:49:01,900
And I just use that because it's the example that I, that I live, but these double standards

1883
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:02,700
are everywhere.

1884
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:05,900
And that's why I'm saying it's a mold that needs to be broken.

1885
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:08,300
It's built into our language.

1886
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:09,660
I know I've mentioned it before.

1887
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:14,620
I have a book I'm very fond of called manmade language by an Australian woman named Dale

1888
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:15,100
Spender.

1889
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:17,420
There are multiple versions of this book.

1890
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:21,340
She started it as her, I think her doctorate thesis in the seventies.

1891
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:31,340
But everything is built around this, this mold of straight white male, Christian, cisgender

1892
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:33,660
language is built that way.

1893
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:39,180
And I'm so glad that right now we have new terms being introduced.

1894
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:43,500
We have new concepts that are coming that there's a good number of people adopting.

1895
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:47,820
We're whittling away at it, but we need to do more.

1896
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:48,620
We need to do more.

1897
01:49:49,580 --> 01:49:54,060
Uh, fifth three men chat says I'm in quote, he fingers default in this country.

1898
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:57,900
And even me and my friends were threatened with weapons because we had nail polish and

1899
01:49:57,900 --> 01:49:58,700
eyeliner on.

1900
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:01,580
I can't imagine what a lot of people have to go through.

1901
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:05,180
And it's, it's the fact that you kind of play.

1902
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:09,420
I mean, it was one could argue that the nail polish and eyeliner is, is gender expression

1903
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:10,700
and playing with that a little bit.

1904
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:14,620
Although I don't think that stuff has to be the mold.

1905
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:15,900
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1906
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:19,900
And to reinforce, I don't think those things have to be tied to any gender, but I think

1907
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:20,940
we understand that.

1908
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:26,940
Most of America does view that stuff as, as gender roles and you, you were outside of

1909
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:27,500
that.

1910
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:31,100
So, um, that's, that's why that happened masculinity.

1911
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:31,500
Yeah.

1912
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:32,000
Yeah.

1913
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:38,060
Toxic masculinity hurts men as much as it hurts everybody else.

1914
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:41,340
People in that mold, you know, it's, it's.

1915
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:45,420
It's just, it's sick.

1916
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:48,140
It's a sickness in society.

1917
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:55,500
And sadly, the sickness has been building for centuries, you know, for millennia.

1918
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:58,620
And we need to be better than it.

1919
01:50:58,620 --> 01:51:03,820
We need to actually show that we need to be enlightened people and we need to learn from

1920
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:07,020
the past, but, oh no, learning from the past.

1921
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:08,940
What is this past thing you speak of?

1922
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:10,780
I don't want to think about these negative things.

1923
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:15,260
I'd rather be comfortable in my little mold that keeps me on top of the food chain.

1924
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:17,740
Sounds too progressive for me.

1925
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:20,780
All right, moving on.

1926
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:21,900
We do have a time.

1927
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:25,580
I wouldn't say constraint, but we are running a little long tonight, so I want to keep the

1928
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:26,700
news going.

1929
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,300
So let's get to our next story.

1930
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:28,800
Loki.

1931
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:29,740
Yeah.

1932
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:34,220
Let's talk about, uh, another thing that also had the government coming after people.

1933
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:43,580
Well, I would assume, um, so Rockstar Games leak of Grand Theft Auto six, um, of course

1934
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:44,860
attracted a lot of attention.

1935
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:51,260
So, of course, they were locking, uh, Rockstar was locking social media.

1936
01:51:52,380 --> 01:52:01,100
Um, apparently on the 18th of September, uh, GTA forums, uh, there was, um, I think they

1937
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:08,940
also did some, uh, they were, uh, taking down, of course, the poster of these leaks, um,

1938
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:13,660
their accounts on GTA forums, which isn't really owned by Rockstar Games, but whatever.

1939
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:22,700
Um, and then of course, uh, there was also, um, different, uh, locked posts, like with

1940
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:27,580
tweets and Instagram posts that were taken down, uh, DMCA type stuff as well.

1941
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:31,740
So they were trying to, you know, kind of get a hold of any of the videos that were

1942
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:33,180
being out, you know, spread out there.

1943
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:34,780
They were taking those all down.

1944
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:43,340
Um, and then we have news that the city of London police have, uh, posted that on Thursday,

1945
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:50,220
22nd, they have arrested a 17 year old, um, in Oxford on suspicion of hacking as part

1946
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:57,420
of the investigation into, uh, was it the Uber and Rockstar Games hacks.

1947
01:52:57,420 --> 01:53:02,460
Apparently this person was believed to be connected with the group, uh, lapses.

1948
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:10,460
And they had, um, apparently hacked lots of different companies, including, uh, Microsoft,

1949
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:19,100
Cisco, Samsung, Nvidia, and Okta, and even, um, uh, the Brazil, Brazil's Ministry of Health

1950
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:19,600
as well.

1951
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:26,060
So no word if that's necessarily the right person that was responsible for all this,

1952
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:33,180
but, um, they did catch somebody who I think they, that their information also been docked

1953
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:33,420
out.

1954
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:35,100
Allegedly someone said they were high.

1955
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,980
I don't know, too much stuff going around, hard to know what to believe.

1956
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:42,300
Uh, but that is not the end of the hacks.

1957
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:48,380
So apparently take two, um, not having the best of luck, but, uh, according to a post

1958
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:52,700
on the official two K support Twitter, I think something is coming up later in the show on

1959
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,580
this actually.

1960
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:55,900
So we'll probably talk about that a little later.

1961
01:53:56,860 --> 01:53:57,580
Okay.

1962
01:53:57,580 --> 01:53:57,900
All right.

1963
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:59,100
Well then that's it.

1964
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:06,220
But the, um, uh, part about the hack and so forth with grand theft auto six, um, is very

1965
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:11,580
interesting, um, that the, the person that reported this is, is somebody I've known online

1966
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:16,300
for a long time, and they're very in tune with internet culture.

1967
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:20,540
Um, so it was very, very interesting to see, um, this all kind of come out.

1968
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:26,380
Uh, I, I'm very curious, like where, uh, that was all kind of figured out and how that was,

1969
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:30,140
uh, you know, this particular individual was responsible.

1970
01:54:30,140 --> 01:54:34,940
I guess we'll see her more in the coming weeks as we start to see, uh, some of the, um, um,

1971
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:38,140
you know, court stuff that may come out of it.

1972
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:39,980
Yeah, we'll have to see, I guess.

1973
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:41,820
All right.

1974
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:47,660
Well, um, along similar lines, talking about, um, the rockstar and so forth, uh, and what

1975
01:54:47,660 --> 01:54:53,260
they've been going through, uh, some developers have actually, uh, I want to say they're sort

1976
01:54:53,260 --> 01:55:00,140
of showing support for rockstar by bagging on internet, internet, uh, tweeters and people

1977
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:04,140
that have really shit opinions, uh, with some of this stuff, actually aren't really dumb

1978
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:05,180
opinions, honestly.

1979
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:10,220
Like, seriously, it's just like these people, I guess, don't know how video game development

1980
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:10,620
works.

1981
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:11,660
No, they don't.

1982
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:17,660
So for example, um, character artists, Xavier, uh, Cole, ho call Stoney.

1983
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:18,460
I hope I said that right.

1984
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:22,460
I'm sorry, but they are a character artists for ratchet and clank, rift apart, 3d.

1985
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:27,980
And they wrote a tweet that said, this is the greatest extremely confident, but has

1986
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:29,820
no idea what they're talking about.

1987
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:31,500
Take I've ever seen.

1988
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,660
And it was in reply to a, it was a screen.

1989
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:35,340
Oh, I love that they did this right too.

1990
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:39,740
They screenshotted the tweet instead of quote, tweeting it to prevent the tweet from getting

1991
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:42,140
further engagement and the screenshot.

1992
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:45,180
And I'm not going to say who tweeted it because they don't deserve to have their account.

1993
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:51,100
Shout it out said, if you knew how game development goes, you'd know that visuals are one of the

1994
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:52,540
first things done.

1995
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:55,260
This game is four years into planning and development.

1996
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:58,540
What you see is almost exactly what you will get this.

1997
01:55:58,540 --> 01:56:01,900
The next year is mission coding and debugging all backend stuff.

1998
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:09,180
It does look ass and that unleash the floodgates of this new man, since graphics are the first

1999
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:10,540
thing finished in a video game.

2000
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:16,700
And so the developers of control actually showed what control looked like early on with

2001
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:23,260
these giant boxes that said, throw me as part of what was the environment there.

2002
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:27,740
The naughty dog tweeted out what last of us look like in development.

2003
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:34,060
The cult of the lamb developers even tweeted out a screenshot with the meme graphics of

2004
01:56:34,060 --> 01:56:37,580
the first things finished in a video game that showed what the video game looked like

2005
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:42,140
in a very early state where a lot of the graphics were very rough and not quite polished at

2006
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:42,940
that point.

2007
01:56:42,940 --> 01:56:44,300
And so on and so on.

2008
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:52,060
Game developers around the world have come together to dunk on dumb ass tweets that pretend

2009
01:56:52,060 --> 01:56:56,860
they know what goes into game development when in fact they know nothing about it.

2010
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:59,980
And that's a lot of Twitter opinions, unfortunately, we see in these day and age.

2011
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:01,820
So I'm glad this person is getting dunked on.

2012
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:03,980
Say something too.

2013
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:06,060
It's not just video game development.

2014
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:10,620
If I'm doing a graphic layout, I'm going to use a shitload of placeholders.

2015
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:14,620
I will use low res pictures to save on my work.

2016
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:19,420
When I'm working on video editing, I'll use what's called proxy media, where instead

2017
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:26,140
of using my very big, very slow 4K footage, I'm using like 720p placeholders.

2018
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:32,300
You know, it makes sense that when you are starting a layout, you do not start with your

2019
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:33,020
best stuff.

2020
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:36,860
You start by putting a foundation down.

2021
01:57:36,860 --> 01:57:38,220
You start with your engine.

2022
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:39,580
You start with your play.

2023
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:41,100
You start with your physics.

2024
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:42,780
The graphics are going to come after.

2025
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:46,780
Every movie starts with a storyboard, right?

2026
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:50,940
And before a frame of footage is shot, even in my job when putting together, you know,

2027
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:54,060
things that have, because I do layouts with PowerPoints and the guides and so forth.

2028
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:57,900
I use a site similar to Shutterstock for like art.

2029
01:57:57,900 --> 01:57:59,580
It's not that one, but it's a different one.

2030
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:06,300
And so what I'll actually do, I put in the art with the fricking, the watermark on it

2031
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:11,340
and everything ugly and so forth, just as a placeholder so that people can see this

2032
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:14,140
is the art that we're going to use if this is approved.

2033
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:18,140
And then once it's approved, then we pay for the art, get it in and put it all in there.

2034
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:20,460
So we're all clear with, you know, copyright and all that stuff.

2035
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:23,660
The art was done before you started that PowerPoint.

2036
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,780
No, it wasn't.

2037
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:28,460
No, I'm saying a low version was done while the content is being reviewed.

2038
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:31,260
But it was on Shutterstock, therefore it was done before.

2039
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:33,020
I said it wasn't Shutterstock, but sure.

2040
01:58:33,020 --> 01:58:34,140
Or whatever.

2041
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:34,700
All right.

2042
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:35,100
Anyway.

2043
01:58:35,980 --> 01:58:36,460
All right.

2044
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:39,820
And lots of people making other analogies in chat, but I think we all get it.

2045
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:42,780
This tweeter had no idea what they were talking about.

2046
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:49,020
I'm also going to say this too, is that when you're working in the art production side

2047
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:54,540
of it, you're not going to start with having a pretty finished model at all either.

2048
01:58:54,540 --> 01:59:01,180
You're going to make your skeleton, you're going to have a rough blob model that you

2049
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:09,100
were going to mold into the shape and then fine tune, you know, your model.

2050
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:13,660
And this comes from someone who has done 3D modeling and ended up with a cat taking his

2051
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:14,700
shit by accident.

2052
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:23,180
Um, you're, it's one, it's all, you've got to build from, from a foundation.

2053
01:59:23,180 --> 01:59:23,980
You've got a blank.

2054
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:26,380
No, you're fine.

2055
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:27,980
This is pet peeve.

2056
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:34,540
I wanted to see if this particular individual kind of doubled down on their comments or

2057
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:35,900
apologized for them.

2058
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:37,820
So I went to their Twitter account.

2059
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:38,460
It's locked.

2060
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:41,740
So anyway.

2061
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:44,460
They did the run and hide method.

2062
01:59:44,860 --> 01:59:47,260
They fucked around and they found out.

2063
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:48,460
All right.

2064
01:59:49,260 --> 01:59:50,620
Moving on next story.

2065
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:53,100
I think Dark Soccer, we're back to you.

2066
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:54,620
I can't with people.

2067
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:55,980
I'm just saying right now.

2068
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:57,340
So how about something better?

2069
01:59:57,900 --> 02:00:02,460
Um, y'all, y'all remember the nineties when we had Blockbuster?

2070
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:04,300
I try to forget, but sure.

2071
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:05,260
No, the nineties were awesome.

2072
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:08,540
Yeah, we had good music in the nineties.

2073
02:00:08,540 --> 02:00:16,140
Um, anyway, though, uh, the Blockbuster World Video Game Championships is coming back.

2074
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:20,140
In fact, it's supposed to be back in October.

2075
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:22,620
So they have the one store?

2076
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:31,500
Well, no, let me, so the Blockbuster World Video Game Championship three is going to

2077
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:37,660
take place October 14th through 16th hosted by Portland Retro Gaming Expo and DoubleJump

2078
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:43,100
events, and they want to, basically it's free to enter.

2079
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:47,980
They just want to make some new memories, but they are teaming up with Blockbuster to

2080
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:53,100
recreate a video, the video rental store for the weekend.

2081
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:59,820
There is the Blockbuster experience room where they can pick up an updated Blockbuster card

2082
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:04,780
and meet the general manager for the last Blockbuster on the planet, Sandy Harding.

2083
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:11,180
Um, they have one store left, one store left.

2084
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:12,300
Yeah, and it's in Oregon.

2085
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:13,900
It's, it's not near Portland.

2086
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:16,700
It's in the Southeast part of Oregon, but it's, it's there.

2087
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:20,380
But the prizes are, I mean, they're okay.

2088
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:26,060
You get a $1,000 PRGE exhibitor hall shopping spree.

2089
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:30,940
Second and third place will respectively get $500 and $250.

2090
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:33,420
Um, there will be two rounds.

2091
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:38,940
Round one will go against each other in Saturn Bomberman, which is a very good version of

2092
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:39,500
Bomberman.

2093
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:43,580
Um, the first player to win three battles moves on to round two.

2094
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:49,900
Round two will be a high score on Downfall OG Plus for the Atari Jaguar.

2095
02:01:51,100 --> 02:02:00,860
And then, um, and, uh, I, I mean, it's not a good Jaguar.

2096
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:01,340
Game.

2097
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:04,940
I'm just saying, but Saturn Bomberman is great.

2098
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:13,900
I, I, I wonder if any of these, uh, people actually are, have played Saturn Bomberman

2099
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:17,660
or have played a Bomberman question mark, maybe.

2100
02:02:18,380 --> 02:02:27,100
Um, but I mean, there were the original, um, Blockbuster, uh, world championship.

2101
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:30,220
People would compete in these different stores across the US.

2102
02:02:30,940 --> 02:02:36,140
And then the store champions who were the winners would go on to compete at Gamepro's

2103
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:37,820
headquarters in San Francisco.

2104
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:39,820
I know I competed in that, it was fun.

2105
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:43,900
Yeah, I think I did once.

2106
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:50,300
Was it NBA, NBA Jam and Ninja Turtles Tournament Fighters?

2107
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:51,660
Yeah.

2108
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:53,980
Now Turtles Tournament Fighters was the one I was good at.

2109
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:55,260
I suck at NBA Jam.

2110
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:57,740
Or was it, was it both games or was that two different?

2111
02:02:57,820 --> 02:03:00,940
I thought it was, I want to say that it was both.

2112
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:05,980
It's, I, I, I don't remember.

2113
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:09,980
We always went to Hollywood video, so I don't.

2114
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:14,460
You know what I found very recently?

2115
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:17,100
I found my laminated Blockbuster card.

2116
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:23,820
The Blockbuster nostalgia is completely lost on me because they did something to piss my

2117
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:27,020
mom off because my mom was a movie buff.

2118
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:27,980
She loved movies.

2119
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:30,620
She loved obscure ass fucking foreign films.

2120
02:03:30,620 --> 02:03:31,580
That was her favorite.

2121
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:35,260
And, um, she, but she hated Blockbuster.

2122
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:35,740
Like they did.

2123
02:03:36,220 --> 02:03:40,460
I think she was mad at Blockbuster because Blockbuster required her to have a credit

2124
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:42,860
card and she's like, and this was just my mother.

2125
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:47,980
If you knew her, she was very much like, I'm not giving my credit card information to anyone.

2126
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:50,460
They can, they can suck it basically.

2127
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:56,620
So, um, but for whatever reason, I can't say and commit, you know, that that was the

2128
02:03:56,620 --> 02:04:00,220
absolutely the reason, but all I know is that Blockbuster did something to piss her off.

2129
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:01,500
So we never went there.

2130
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:06,940
It was always Hollywood video or her favorite, her favorite place to rent movies was the

2131
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:07,580
warehouse.

2132
02:04:08,140 --> 02:04:11,100
For those that remember that it rented movies there.

2133
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:12,380
Oh yeah, they did.

2134
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:13,500
Yeah, they did.

2135
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:17,180
I don't, what were all, what with the warehouse was in with all these other brands too, but

2136
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:19,580
the warehouse was, yeah, they rented a lot of movies.

2137
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:23,900
It was a big, it was a big, um, tape and CD store.

2138
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:26,860
Two back in the, that's where I bought my first PlayStation two.

2139
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:32,860
When I would go visit granny and Dothan, Alabama, we would go rent from the Curtis Mathis.

2140
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:36,220
Who remembers Curtis Mathis?

2141
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:37,020
We didn't have him here.

2142
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:37,520
So no.

2143
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:43,260
Well, I mean, it was mostly to sell the electronics, but they had like a wall of movies and I saw

2144
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:49,420
some weird shit, but I think I rented return of the Jedi, like so many times, so many times.

2145
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:57,260
But we had, we had a few different like local rental places that would get like the really

2146
02:04:57,260 --> 02:05:00,620
good nest games that I would rent from.

2147
02:05:00,620 --> 02:05:03,820
And then I rented a turbo graphics from a couple of times.

2148
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:12,220
So I'm trying to do the quick poll of a YouTube or not YouTube Wikipedia to see what it is.

2149
02:05:12,860 --> 02:05:19,100
Warehouse had purchased blockbuster music from Viacom at 1998, but I can't figure out,

2150
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:20,620
it doesn't say what the other stores were.

2151
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:24,460
I guess the warehouse was unique to California.

2152
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:27,820
I thought they were in with other birds until you mentioned it just now.

2153
02:05:27,820 --> 02:05:28,320
Yeah.

2154
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:33,420
So wasn't there like another one that was like the warehouse that was in the mall.

2155
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:35,260
I'm trying to think what that was now.

2156
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:37,660
It was like FYE, FYE, that type of thing.

2157
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:38,460
It wasn't FYE.

2158
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:39,500
I, yeah, I remember that.

2159
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:42,860
That was very much like the warehouse, but there was also another one that was smaller.

2160
02:05:43,420 --> 02:05:48,060
So dark Sakura, do you know, and I apologize to the listeners for getting extremely local,

2161
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:49,900
but tangents, they happen.

2162
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:54,700
Do you know out in Roseville where the Mongolian barbecue is that a lot of people like in the

2163
02:05:54,700 --> 02:05:59,260
TJ Maxx Plaza and there's the, there's the learn we used to go to.

2164
02:05:59,260 --> 02:05:59,580
Yes.

2165
02:05:59,580 --> 02:06:04,060
And there's the learning, the learning store, the Lake shore learning center, that place

2166
02:06:04,060 --> 02:06:05,340
that used to be the warehouse.

2167
02:06:06,300 --> 02:06:06,700
No.

2168
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:07,100
Okay.

2169
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:08,060
And that's yeah.

2170
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:12,620
Going way back, throwback for the record.

2171
02:06:12,620 --> 02:06:14,060
One, one little tangent.

2172
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:14,880
Hmm.

2173
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:20,940
When I, when we saw Weird Al last night, he kept talking about tower records and I, but

2174
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:23,420
I was here to experience the tower records.

2175
02:06:23,420 --> 02:06:28,540
They bulldozed the tower building here or not, not the, not the theater, but the record

2176
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:29,820
store across the street is gone.

2177
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:32,540
The one that used to be dimple then it, they know it's gone.

2178
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:33,420
They bulldozed it.

2179
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:34,860
I know.

2180
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:35,100
Right.

2181
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:36,140
That's like me.

2182
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:38,220
That isn't the original tower records.

2183
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:43,020
Cause technically the original, the original tower records is now tower cafe because tower

2184
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:46,620
cafes, indoor portion was a drug store and tower records started in the back of that

2185
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:47,420
drug store.

2186
02:06:47,420 --> 02:06:51,100
So if you're eating at the back table in tower cafe, you're eating at the original tower

2187
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:51,820
records.

2188
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:59,900
But the watt location was the first actual retail full tower records location.

2189
02:06:59,900 --> 02:07:01,260
And now it's a Goodwill.

2190
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:04,140
And they actually have the old tower signs still in the back of the Goodwill.

2191
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:09,100
So yeah, that I, that I remember I like go and that's a really good Goodwill as well.

2192
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:09,420
Yeah.

2193
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:12,460
Um, you know, the last time I went to the tower theater, I think it was with you to

2194
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:13,420
see the shape of water.

2195
02:07:14,140 --> 02:07:14,700
Oh yeah.

2196
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:16,060
That was a few years ago.

2197
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:16,380
Wow.

2198
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:16,700
All right.

2199
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:20,460
Less tangents, more news, two hours, 10 minutes.

2200
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:22,540
We haven't even gotten to the classic game.

2201
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:23,420
Let's go.

2202
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:23,820
All right.

2203
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:25,180
Loki.

2204
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:26,780
Just do anything tonight.

2205
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:28,220
I'm just here for the ride.

2206
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:31,260
You're helping make the show long.

2207
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:33,260
So fine with that.

2208
02:07:33,260 --> 02:07:35,420
You know, fewer Weskers.

2209
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:43,580
Uh, so we're back to talking about, um, this lawsuit between the destiny to cheat makers

2210
02:07:43,580 --> 02:07:44,780
and bungee.

2211
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:50,060
Um, you may remember last time they were saying that the lawsuit was frivolous.

2212
02:07:50,060 --> 02:07:54,380
That was of course, the claims that were made by aim junkies, which is a website, I guess

2213
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:57,900
it's owned by a group called a Phoenix digital group.

2214
02:07:58,700 --> 02:08:06,780
Um, now they're claiming in a counter suit that bungee had access and downloaded files

2215
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:10,460
on the personal computer of the defendant, James May.

2216
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:21,980
Um, so basically saying that he was hacked by bungee, um, that also that bungee used

2217
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:25,580
the information obtained to conduct further surveillance on the group as well.

2218
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:33,260
So we'll see, um, hacked by bungee is going to be the name of my first album.

2219
02:08:34,700 --> 02:08:38,220
I don't believe it, but we'll, we'll see what we'll see.

2220
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:41,820
It's an interesting, um, strategy.

2221
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:43,500
We'll have to see if it pays off.

2222
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:43,740
Yeah.

2223
02:08:43,740 --> 02:08:48,860
We'll have to see, uh, we'll have to see what comes up in court with that whole situation.

2224
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:49,360
Huh?

2225
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:50,380
Yeah.

2226
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:50,860
All right.

2227
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:51,260
Yeah.

2228
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:51,580
All right.

2229
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:57,580
Well, uh, moving on, let's talk about, uh, a little more about those Atari recharged

2230
02:08:57,580 --> 02:08:59,980
games I sort of referenced during my gaming week.

2231
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:03,340
So Atari recharged games, some of the ones that have already been released are going

2232
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:04,700
to get new content.

2233
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:09,100
Now, this article I'm looking at specifically speaks to the Nintendo switch, but a lot of

2234
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:10,940
these games are also on the PC.

2235
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:15,340
So I'm not sure at the PI, but I tried to search other news sites and I couldn't find

2236
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:20,540
the news if this was coming to switch as well, or I'm sorry, steam PC as well.

2237
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:22,060
But we do know it's coming to switch.

2238
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:28,460
So asteroids, centipede breakout, black widow, and gravatar, all those recharged versions

2239
02:09:28,460 --> 02:09:30,780
are going to be getting new content on the switch.

2240
02:09:30,780 --> 02:09:37,100
It's bonus challenge levels that were previously only available on the Atari VCS.

2241
02:09:37,100 --> 02:09:39,660
And that may be the reason why it's not completely in steam.

2242
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:40,140
I don't know.

2243
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:45,580
But they are a very high level of difficulty for these, and it will be new challenges for

2244
02:09:45,580 --> 02:09:49,900
existing players and additional value to anyone who's getting the titles for the first

2245
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:51,740
time arcade mode.

2246
02:09:51,740 --> 02:09:54,620
Oh, and this is exactly what dark Tetsuya was talking about earlier.

2247
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:59,260
Arcade mode will now give you three lives instead of one, just like the coin op games

2248
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:00,060
they are based on.

2249
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:01,020
So that's fun.

2250
02:10:01,020 --> 02:10:06,380
And a new arachnophobia mode is coming to black widow recharged, and that will turn

2251
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:08,460
the spider into a frosty snowman.

2252
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:12,220
And you're shooting snowflakes instead of webs.

2253
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:17,660
That's actually so like, it's not it literally is for people who have arachnophobia.

2254
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:24,620
You can change it away from spiders into, I guess, Sonic Christmas Nights, where now

2255
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:28,060
you're playing a Christmas themed game or whatever.

2256
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:29,020
So it's fun.

2257
02:10:29,660 --> 02:10:31,820
All right, so that's neat.

2258
02:10:31,820 --> 02:10:33,340
Look for that on the switch eShop.

2259
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:34,460
All right.

2260
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:39,660
Meanwhile, since I brought up Atari, I think it's a good time for us to talk about other

2261
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:42,140
classic games in this segment.

2262
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:45,340
Except I forgot my button pushing device doesn't work.

2263
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:49,740
So let me try that transition again and we'll go to this next segment.

2264
02:11:12,140 --> 02:11:17,980
And here we have one of those games that I can't believe it's 10 years old.

2265
02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:18,700
But here we are.

2266
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:21,260
Dark Sakura.

2267
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:22,700
Skullgirls.

2268
02:11:24,460 --> 02:11:31,340
Skullgirls is a 2D fighting game that was developed by Revenge Labs and published by

2269
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:32,300
Autumn Games.

2270
02:11:33,180 --> 02:11:46,540
The game came out on April 10th, 2012, and it's pretty fun.

2271
02:11:47,180 --> 02:11:53,580
The game was first released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live and was so positively

2272
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:57,500
received that it expanded, it got more characters, etc.

2273
02:11:58,060 --> 02:12:06,780
So the premise of the game is that you will fight each other, either teams of one, two,

2274
02:12:06,780 --> 02:12:09,260
or three characters and knock out your opponents.

2275
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:15,260
Whoever has the most cumulative health when the time runs out too, just like any fighting

2276
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:15,500
game.

2277
02:12:16,860 --> 02:12:23,100
But the setting is about a skull heart, which is an artifact that grants wishes for women.

2278
02:12:24,060 --> 02:12:30,300
If a wish with an impure soul uses a skull heart, she turns into a monster called a Skullgirl.

2279
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:40,540
And it's a pretty, pretty, pretty interesting game, although it did have some setbacks.

2280
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:49,900
Autumn Games in May 2012 was sued over allegations of fraud about an unreleased property, Def

2281
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:56,060
Jam Rapstar, which cut off some of Skullgirls financial support.

2282
02:12:57,100 --> 02:12:59,420
They had to lay off the entire development team.

2283
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:05,900
The core team reformed as Lab Zero Games in November 2012.

2284
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:11,740
And after crowdfunding, they raised enough money to continue their work and they developed

2285
02:13:11,740 --> 02:13:16,940
the Windows version released by Marvelous in August of 2013.

2286
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:23,900
And then Autumn Games severed their ties with Konami in December 2013.

2287
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:31,100
And so Konami requested to have the game removed from the PlayStation and Xbox storefronts.

2288
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:39,100
The game was re-released in 2014 as Skullgirls Encore, ported to PS4 and PC in 2015, where

2289
02:13:39,100 --> 02:13:41,900
it was renamed as Skullgirls Second Encore.

2290
02:13:42,620 --> 02:13:48,540
And then another version in the Japanese arcades and Vita came out.

2291
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:55,740
For the record, the arcade version is on a Taito type X squared system.

2292
02:13:57,580 --> 02:14:04,460
But then we've had like the Switch version in October 2019, Xbox One and Xbox Series

2293
02:14:04,460 --> 02:14:07,820
X releases are planned for this year.

2294
02:14:07,820 --> 02:14:09,340
I don't know if they're already out.

2295
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:16,300
And then Skullgirls Mobile was developed by Hidden Variable Studios and released for iOS

2296
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:18,060
and Android in 2017.

2297
02:14:18,860 --> 02:14:23,660
And it's all over the place.

2298
02:14:26,620 --> 02:14:30,220
So there, of course, is some drama.

2299
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:37,660
Autumn Games and Hidden Variable Studios severed ties with Lab Zero Games after sexual harassment

2300
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:42,620
allegations raised against the lead designer and programmer Mike Zimon.

2301
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:46,220
And so they were dissolved.

2302
02:14:46,220 --> 02:14:52,780
And then some of the former members created a new studio called Future Club, collaborating

2303
02:14:52,780 --> 02:14:57,020
with Hidden Variable Studios for future content for a second Encore.

2304
02:14:57,980 --> 02:15:08,540
So basically, the model for the engine was based off of Marvel versus Capcom 2, with

2305
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:14,620
several of their game mechanics, like the tag team combat, character assists, delayed

2306
02:15:14,620 --> 02:15:16,300
hyper combos, etc.

2307
02:15:17,260 --> 02:15:24,460
And you can play with different ratios very similarly to Capcom versus SNK 2, where you

2308
02:15:24,460 --> 02:15:29,340
can select up to three fighters on the team, but your life and power is bound.

2309
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:43,580
So you'd have either a variety of characters with less power in life each, or you can just

2310
02:15:43,580 --> 02:15:45,740
have your favorite, your champion.

2311
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:53,340
The game has story mode, arcade mode versus mode, training room, a tutorial mode, and

2312
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:56,300
online play using GGPO Network Library.

2313
02:15:57,660 --> 02:16:06,060
It also, it had some different features that looked at system and balance issues, such

2314
02:16:06,060 --> 02:16:07,900
as infinite combo detection.

2315
02:16:09,580 --> 02:16:14,220
And then it offered protection against unblockable attacks.

2316
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:20,460
So, for example, when a person uses a low hitting move and a high hitting assist attack,

2317
02:16:21,420 --> 02:16:29,420
they have ways of blocking that by giving a period of unblockable protection after successfully

2318
02:16:29,420 --> 02:16:30,300
blocking an attack.

2319
02:16:32,220 --> 02:16:39,420
So they were really just, you know, focused.

2320
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:42,060
They always had updates for it.

2321
02:16:42,060 --> 02:16:47,660
They had different add-ons, like faster gameplay, the online training, like I said before, a

2322
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:58,220
stun meter, and they also had a local game mode called Typing of the Skullcurl, similarly

2323
02:16:58,220 --> 02:16:59,740
to Typing of the Dead.

2324
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:08,540
And so the teams would generate meter and attacks based on their typing accuracy.

2325
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:15,580
It's fully voiced story modes, cross-platform play across the entire PlayStation family,

2326
02:17:16,220 --> 02:17:22,380
Second Encore brought in different challenges where you have unique battle conditions, different

2327
02:17:22,380 --> 02:17:31,180
trials, different combo challenges, an endless survival mode, different RPG progression

2328
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:33,820
tactics, customization, deck building.

2329
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:41,980
So as far as the characters go, you had initially eight playable characters.

2330
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:50,860
You had Felia Medici, who has a hair parasite named Samson, which we're seeing, well, we

2331
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:53,260
were seeing that play.

2332
02:17:56,300 --> 02:18:08,620
There's a circus performer named Sara Bella, an anti-skull-bruel cyborg named Patricia

2333
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:17,180
Peacock Watson and Painwill, who we're seeing in there, Princess Parasoul Renoir, Nadia

2334
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:23,820
Fortune, and then Valentine, and then the shape-shifting demon called Double.

2335
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:30,540
And then after the Indiegogo crowdfunding, there were five new characters named Sienna

2336
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:39,020
Squiggly Cantiello, who is a zombie, along with Leviathan, an anti-skull-girl cyborg

2337
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:41,420
named Benjamin Big Band Birdland.

2338
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:42,940
I think that's funny.

2339
02:18:44,060 --> 02:18:50,460
A parasite called Eliza, a wrestler called Beowulf, and another anti-skull-girl android

2340
02:18:50,460 --> 02:18:52,060
called Robo Fortune.

2341
02:18:52,060 --> 02:18:55,820
A clone Ophelia named Fukua was added to the game later.

2342
02:18:56,380 --> 02:19:02,220
She was there for an April Fool's Day joke, and then everyone wanted to keep her.

2343
02:19:02,220 --> 02:19:05,500
There were more characters added for season one pass.

2344
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:14,460
The character Annie, Parasoul's sister Umbrella, Black Dahlia, and Skullgirl Marie.

2345
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:22,140
So it's been lauded so much.

2346
02:19:22,140 --> 02:19:30,220
And I already talked about the drama earlier, so I'm not going to go too much more into

2347
02:19:30,220 --> 02:19:33,180
that, but the game also...

2348
02:19:34,380 --> 02:19:38,700
The publishers also talked about a fifth DLC, Fighter, other free content.

2349
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:42,220
They're still supporting this game like you would not believe.

2350
02:19:43,740 --> 02:19:51,900
But for the music, the original album had 28 compositions done by Yamane Michiru.

2351
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:56,460
Vincent Diamante, Blaine McGurdy, and Brenton Cossack.

2352
02:19:57,820 --> 02:20:03,900
And you can still buy the whole soundtrack, although if you did $10 to the Indiegogo campaign,

2353
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:07,900
you get a digital copy of the soundtrack, or if you did more, you get a physical release

2354
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:08,220
of it.

2355
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:18,060
And basically with Yamane, she contributed for work in the Castlevania series.

2356
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:24,780
And so they really wanted her in there, and they wanted a jazzy theme.

2357
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:31,020
In fact, you can even see that with the Showtime right at the beginning.

2358
02:20:32,940 --> 02:20:36,460
And it's been very, very popular.

2359
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:47,100
The game received very, very high Metacritic scores, the lowest of them being a 71 for

2360
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:52,380
iOS, the highest being an 82 for PS3.

2361
02:20:56,460 --> 02:21:00,700
Everyone's given them some pretty high-level ratings.

2362
02:21:03,180 --> 02:21:08,860
It was the highest selling game on Xbox Live Arcade when it was released, and the third

2363
02:21:08,860 --> 02:21:12,060
best selling on PlayStation Network for April 2012.

2364
02:21:12,060 --> 02:21:14,940
In Japan, the game took off so well.

2365
02:21:17,980 --> 02:21:27,660
It's been well-loved, and for a little bit of legacy information, 2019 Anime Expo, there

2366
02:21:27,660 --> 02:21:36,780
was a webcomic published by Webtoon, and at EVO 2022, Skullgirls was added as a main event

2367
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:37,100
game.

2368
02:21:38,140 --> 02:21:40,140
And that's it, Skullgirls.

2369
02:21:40,940 --> 02:21:43,740
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Skullgirls.

2370
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:45,180
I love this game.

2371
02:21:45,180 --> 02:21:46,860
Again, it's one of those things where it's like, really?

2372
02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:48,700
This is already 10 years old?

2373
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:49,260
Ouch.

2374
02:21:49,260 --> 02:21:53,820
But then a lot of people are also saying, the graphics of this game hold up very well.

2375
02:21:54,700 --> 02:22:00,860
And part of that is probably the support, but also it's a very well-drawn and put-together

2376
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:01,260
game.

2377
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:03,020
I was going to say, the hand-drawn stuff is what holds up.

2378
02:22:03,020 --> 02:22:05,340
No one's surprised that Sonic Box succeeded at it.

2379
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:06,140
Yeah, yeah.

2380
02:22:06,860 --> 02:22:08,860
All right, so awesome, awesome.

2381
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:12,060
Skullgirls is your classic game of the week.

2382
02:22:12,060 --> 02:22:13,740
All right, we're going to move on.

2383
02:22:13,740 --> 02:22:17,420
We have plenty more show to come, although we'll probably do a lot of these stories

2384
02:22:17,420 --> 02:22:18,540
rapid-fire style.

2385
02:22:18,540 --> 02:22:24,300
But I want to make sure we have time for any calls over in our green room, vognetwork.com

2386
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:27,820
slash discord, if you want to join our green room and possibly join us on the air for a

2387
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:28,620
discussion tonight.

2388
02:22:29,180 --> 02:22:31,980
But we still have a little ways before we're going to get to those calls, because first,

2389
02:22:31,980 --> 02:22:36,060
we need to get through rapid-fire news and talk about some other headlines quickly.

2390
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:36,620
So, Loki.

2391
02:22:38,380 --> 02:22:40,460
So we got a tease of a tease.

2392
02:22:40,460 --> 02:22:47,500
So there's a post by New York Comic-Con that says, join us for October 6th at 4 p.m.

2393
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:53,180
Eastern Time for the teaser trailer premiere of the Super Mario Brothers movie.

2394
02:22:53,180 --> 02:22:55,740
Not the old one, the brand new one by Illumination.

2395
02:22:56,380 --> 02:22:59,420
So we're going to get a trailer for that soon.

2396
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:05,500
I will be in a pressurized tube 30,000 feet above the Earth's surface at the time that

2397
02:23:05,500 --> 02:23:09,180
this trailer drops, and I don't think there is any place I would rather be.

2398
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:19,660
Uh, and then, uh, we've also got news that Borderlands game, uh, spinoff Tiny Tina's

2399
02:23:19,660 --> 02:23:21,980
Wonderland is now going to be a franchise.

2400
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:27,100
So they're going to spin it off because it did so well, which is great because we need

2401
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:28,300
more Borderlands type games.

2402
02:23:28,300 --> 02:23:30,620
And I hear this one was good and I still haven't played it.

2403
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:35,580
I know, and I keep waiting for that deep sale, but I imagine by the time, you know, November

2404
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:36,860
is around the corner.

2405
02:23:36,860 --> 02:23:39,980
And so by the time we get to November, this game will be 1999.

2406
02:23:39,980 --> 02:23:41,820
So I'll probably finally pick it up.

2407
02:23:41,820 --> 02:23:42,320
Probably.

2408
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:43,760
All right.

2409
02:23:44,220 --> 02:23:44,860
Uh, there's soccer.

2410
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:51,180
Oh, um, the studio behind Dead Space is making an Iron Man game with Marvel.

2411
02:23:51,740 --> 02:23:56,860
Um, that's Motive Studio and they're doing a single player, third person action game

2412
02:23:56,860 --> 02:23:58,620
starring Iron Man.

2413
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:00,000
Yay.

2414
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:04,300
It was only, you know, very quietly confirmed on Twitter.

2415
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:06,460
I'm excited.

2416
02:24:06,460 --> 02:24:07,020
Yeah.

2417
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:07,820
Yeah, it could be good.

2418
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:09,420
All right.

2419
02:24:09,420 --> 02:24:15,820
And, uh, we do have some incoming quality of life updates for the Capcom Fighting Collection,

2420
02:24:15,820 --> 02:24:20,940
uh, which, uh, or if it's me, it's the Puzzle Fighter II and some fighting games collection.

2421
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:25,580
But hey, uh, the quality of life update is hitting this week on Tuesday, September the

2422
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:26,140
27th.

2423
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:28,700
All the patch notes are not available yet.

2424
02:24:28,700 --> 02:24:35,020
However, this is supposed to include viewable hit boxes, new gem colors for Puzzle Fighter.

2425
02:24:35,020 --> 02:24:38,700
I think this is to address some colorblind issues and make the game more accessible.

2426
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:39,340
Yeah.

2427
02:24:39,340 --> 02:24:42,860
And you can view your opponent's connection status, you know, for people that are, you

2428
02:24:42,860 --> 02:24:44,780
know, trying to do like switching and all that stuff.

2429
02:24:44,780 --> 02:24:46,860
So, uh, yeah, that's pretty cool.

2430
02:24:46,860 --> 02:24:51,660
So, uh, the update is supposed to have more tweaks in addition as well, but, uh, we don't

2431
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:56,060
know exactly what they all are yet, but it is supposed to be a pretty big update coming

2432
02:24:56,620 --> 02:24:57,260
very soon.

2433
02:24:58,380 --> 02:25:04,220

02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:40,060
but it doesn't matter because PA patrol is coming out and that's all it matters.

2474
02:29:40,060 --> 02:29:43,900
It's already a PA patrol game on stadia. Well, this is a grand Prix game. You know what

2475
02:29:44,780 --> 02:29:48,780
they said, Hey, you know what? Mario Kart, I think we can do it better. And then they

2476
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:53,420
failed at it, but it's coming to stadia. And that's, they're like, we're the number one

2479
02:30:06,940 --> 02:30:09,900
Japanese release dates. I'm going to try to make this fast. Um,

2480
02:30:09,900 --> 02:30:14,860

2482
02:30:19,980 --> 02:30:24,380
uh, also in Japan this week. I want to know, is that actually a tennis game or is it like

2483
02:30:24,380 --> 02:30:29,260
a dating SIM that centers around tennis? It's a visual novel that centers around tennis.

2484
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:37,580
Awesome. Um, we also have coming out, uh, the labyrinth of Zangetsu in Japan,

or bullets sold double soul pack, uh, as well as sword art online is out on the switch this week.

2487
02:30:49,660 --> 02:30:55,980
We also have, uh, in Japan coming out on the 30th. So those ones I just read with the 29th on the

2488
02:30:55,980 --> 02:31:05,260
30th, the legend of heroes trails from zero. Uh, we also have, um, Bayonetta gets a Japanese release.

2489
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:09,420
I think this is the rerelease of the first game because it was digital before when you bought

2490
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:13,100
Bayonetta two on the switch, you got a digital copy. So if you want a physical copy in advance

2491
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:19,820
of three, this is your chance coming out of Japan this week. Uh, and that is so FIFA 23. Of course,

2492
02:31:19,820 --> 02:31:25,180
I can't neglect FIFA 23. That's the switch. Let me quickly check in on the PlayStation five

2493
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:30,620
that has Valkyrie Elysium coming out this week as it is everywhere else. I believe that legend of

2494
02:31:30,620 --> 02:31:35,580
heroes kuro no kisuke to Crimson sin in regular and limited edition also on the PlayStation five

2495
02:31:35,580 --> 02:31:42,140

2496
02:31:42,140 --> 02:31:45,740
the PlayStation five this week in Japan, let's go to the UK dark soccer.

02:31:47,980 --> 02:31:56,380
On the 27th. Um, we have a session skate SIM hook go life. Life is strange Arcadia Bay collection.

2498
02:31:56,380 --> 02:32:01,420
I don't even bother to say what everything's on on the 29th Valkyrie Elysium inertial drift

2499
02:32:02,060 --> 02:32:08,060
Pathfinder wrath of the righteous PAW Patrol grand pre sword art online demon throttle

2501
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:23,420
of super pets adventure of crypto and ACE. All right. I'd like to think that's all one title,

2502
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:31,100
but it's a visual novel. Yeah. It's all it's all together. All right. We're going to go through

2503
02:32:31,100 --> 02:32:35,980
these last few stories here, and then I'm going to open up the green room. So vog network.com

2504
02:32:35,980 --> 02:32:40,220
slash discord. If you want to call in tonight, join the green room. Otherwise we have a few

2505
02:32:40,220 --> 02:32:43,340
more stories for you. I was going to say, we're going to rush through them. I don't want to rush

2506
02:32:43,340 --> 02:32:48,460
this first one though. So Loki, tell us a little more about this. Yeah. So, uh, this is pretty

2507
02:32:48,460 --> 02:32:57,500
cool. So Xbox has launched a new program called project amplify. It is to basically promote and

2508
02:32:57,500 --> 02:33:08,540
amplify black voices and, um, developers of color to inspire them to make games. Um, so apparently

2509
02:33:08,540 --> 02:33:14,380
there's, you know, lack of representation in the development community and they're just trying to

2510
02:33:14,380 --> 02:33:23,900
promote, you know, developers to put stuff out on, um, Xbox. So they have a video series, um,

2511
02:33:23,900 --> 02:33:30,780
under, uh, the project amplify name, uh, that's on the ID at Xbox YouTube channel. It's, um,

2512
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:38,860
like 16 episodes that highlights different game designers and they even have, um, different,

2513
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:45,180
it's not just developers. They also have like, you know, um, narrative directors, artists,

2514
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:53,340
software engineers, that type of stuff as well. Um, and this is all in, you know, kind of, uh,

2515
02:33:53,340 --> 02:34:02,060
revolving around also a, uh, revolt summit, which is taking place from September 24th through 25th

2516
02:34:02,060 --> 02:34:08,380
in Atlanta, Georgia. So it's cool. It's nice to see some of those, you know,

2517
02:34:08,380 --> 02:34:15,020
actions and plans around, you know, um, trying to, you know, bring more diversity into gaming and

2518
02:34:15,020 --> 02:34:19,820
game development and so forth. It's nice to see that plan and see it in action. It speaks a lot

2519
02:34:19,820 --> 02:34:27,260
louder, I think than the typical, you know, social media text image, um, committing to do better.

2520
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:33,340
They're also going to have a panel too at that revolt summit as well. Um, so that's going to

2521
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:41,420
be there and then they've got, um, there's a page on their Xbox website, uh, xbox.com that talks

2522
02:34:41,420 --> 02:34:48,060
about, it's like, um, different resources as well. So, you know, they have, um, you know, getting

2523
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:56,460
learning C sharp, um, getting started with unity, um, getting started with unreal engine

2524
02:34:56,460 --> 02:35:03,020
game design, um, development process, narrative tools, art tools, et cetera. So it's, you know,

2525
02:35:03,980 --> 02:35:09,180
all these different things to hopefully help promote, you know, more developers that come

2526
02:35:09,180 --> 02:35:13,740
to the Xbox platform or just become developers in general. All right.

2527
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:19,420
Okay. Let's, uh, just we'll, we'll rapid fire these remaining stories. So dark Sakura.

2528
02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:27,900
Oh, um, there is some drama going on with take two interactive. Their help desk was hacked.

2529
02:35:28,540 --> 02:35:35,660
Um, and so they're, uh, the party that did so send a communication out to players with a malicious

2530
02:35:35,660 --> 02:35:42,060
link. Um, they put out a warning about it, not to open any emails or click on links from 2k games

2531
02:35:42,540 --> 02:35:48,700
support account. And they're encouraging people to reset their passwords stored in the browser,

2532
02:35:48,700 --> 02:35:57,420
um, enable multi-factor authentication, uh, run an antivirus and, uh, check their account settings

2533
02:35:57,420 --> 02:36:04,380
to see if forwarding rules have been added onto their email accounts. Um, they, uh, they have

2534
02:36:04,380 --> 02:36:10,220
taken their support function offline while they investigate and try to correct the issue. Um,

2535
02:36:11,180 --> 02:36:19,260
and, uh, this comes right after an extortion group, uh, lapis with a dollar sign, uh,

2536
02:36:20,460 --> 02:36:25,900
uh, compromised, uh, rockstar games. Um, you know, again with the grand theft auto issue.

2537
02:36:26,460 --> 02:36:34,460
So this seems that there's going a bunch. We'll see, but yeah, be careful for your 2k game stuff.

2538
02:36:35,020 --> 02:36:39,500
Be careful what you click on in general, always exercise good judgment. And if an email sounds

2539
02:36:39,500 --> 02:36:45,340
fishy, probably as it probably is. Yeah. And multi-factor authentication. I mean,

2540
02:36:45,340 --> 02:36:52,300
it's not perfect branding. It's really strong. So pay very close attention to branding

2541
02:36:53,020 --> 02:36:59,260
because they, or, and also the exact email addresses that things come from. Um,

2542
02:37:00,140 --> 02:37:06,540
also you can, if anything looks suspicious, you can show headers and see where they routed from.

2543
02:37:06,540 --> 02:37:15,420
All right. Let's move on Loki. All right. So, uh, I'm a big fan of video game donkey.

2544
02:37:15,420 --> 02:37:21,100
He does some hilarious videos online and makes different like review stuff for video games.

2545
02:37:21,100 --> 02:37:29,900
Well, now he is using his persona on YouTube and his following to help, uh, indie game,

2546
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:36,220
uh, studios publish their games. So he's actually starting a publishing label called big mode.

2547
02:37:36,700 --> 02:37:47,020
And he's basically looking to partner with, um, you know, AAA quality indie games to try to

2548
02:37:47,020 --> 02:37:53,260
promote their game content and get their game out there. So we'll have to see what exactly

2549
02:37:53,260 --> 02:38:01,340
that turns into it's a lot easier to say than to do. I think this individual is going to find out.

2550
02:38:01,340 --> 02:38:05,740
And, um, I, I know we're trying to abbreviate for time, but the one thing I had wanted to say on

2551
02:38:05,740 --> 02:38:14,940
this is, um, quickly, you know, if this was Sony PlayStation leveraging Sony media to push the

2552
02:38:14,940 --> 02:38:19,260
Sony products, which they do do sometimes, let's be real. A lot of these companies do that sort

2553
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:23,180
of thing. I think a lot of us will kind of look at that and go, well, that's shady because they're

2554
02:38:23,180 --> 02:38:30,700
just pushing their own stuff. It's interesting that this individual sees this as the solution

2555
02:38:31,660 --> 02:38:37,020
to put together a publishing arm, what they can promote their own stuff through.

2556
02:38:37,820 --> 02:38:43,580
I'm just saying it's a little bit, I think there's a little bit, I don't know. I don't know if this

2557
02:38:43,580 --> 02:38:47,660
is the smartest move to get into this, but I wish him luck. Um, but I think you're going to find

2558
02:38:47,660 --> 02:38:53,180
with a lot of these indie lower budget titles, a lot of it is, uh, what, you know, like the

2559
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:59,580
trombone champ, what goes viral, what can be the it girl. What's the thing that, because you know

2560
02:38:59,980 --> 02:39:06,380
what, I'm still convinced to this day, YYR's super multitasking is so deserving of its moment in the

2561
02:39:06,380 --> 02:39:13,580
sun, but it just, it like anything else, it needs that moment to go viral, you know, and I can,

2562
02:39:13,580 --> 02:39:17,660
I can hype that game till I'm blue in the face, but until it gets right in front of the right

2563
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:22,300
people, you know, it's, it's not any, there's, there's plenty of other good games I'm unaware

2564
02:39:22,300 --> 02:39:26,700
of that probably need that moment. Anyway, I could say more, but I'm trying to move fast. So

2565
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:31,340
I will go right into the last story here, which is about the song list that has been released

2566
02:39:31,340 --> 02:39:38,060
for a theater, them final bar. Yes. The song list was revealed. And, uh, I already have seen plenty

2567
02:39:38,060 --> 02:39:45,020
of the punchlines in our discord about yes. Crazy chocobo from final fantasy 13, two is in there.

2568
02:39:45,020 --> 02:39:48,780
Of course. I bet. I mean, of course it was going to be in there. They weren't going to cut songs

2569
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:54,540
like when they're doing like 400 songs, anything they've done a chart for, uh, in these games was

2570
02:39:54,540 --> 02:39:59,900
going to be in the game. That's free content. Uh, it would be very easy to skip that song and never

2571
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:05,020
play it, which would be the right call. Cause it's not a great song. However, uh, when I was looking

2572
02:40:05,020 --> 02:40:09,340
at the list of like, okay, final fantasy 14 content, I wanted to see what they added from

2573
02:40:09,340 --> 02:40:14,460
fantasy 14 and they put some really sweet stuff from a shadowbringers in there. So, um, they did

2574
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:21,340
add some stuff. Um, yeah, so, uh, there's a lot and, uh, the, the bonus stuff from other square

2575
02:40:21,340 --> 02:40:26,460
games, it looks like they have a pretty impressive lineup of songs from other square games as well.

2576
02:40:26,460 --> 02:40:32,140
They're bringing in things from, um, uh, live alive is going to be in the game, which I thought

2577
02:40:32,140 --> 02:40:37,420
was very interesting. They also are going to some of the, um, spinoff albums like the primals,

2578
02:40:37,420 --> 02:40:43,740
uh, has a song in it from their CD, the scions and sinners arrangement album for Fava SE 14.

2579
02:40:43,740 --> 02:40:49,020
But then you get into like the saga series, the world ends with you. We all knew near was going

2580
02:40:49,020 --> 02:40:52,860
to have some pad. Yes. They're doing way to the world. That's the only one I needed to see here

2581
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:58,540
in there. Um, chrono, mana games, octopath traveler. I mean, this is really going to be

2582
02:40:58,540 --> 02:41:05,580
like a square collection. The only square series that seems to be missing is kingdom hearts,

2583
02:41:05,580 --> 02:41:10,060
but I'm going to assume that's understandable. Number one, you had the melody of mediocrity

2584
02:41:10,060 --> 02:41:14,940
game that already came out that tried to change the theater, them formula and failed miserably,

2585
02:41:14,940 --> 02:41:19,900
but you also have the Disney thing in there, which probably makes it a little more difficult.

2586
02:41:19,900 --> 02:41:24,940
Um, so we, we may not see those unless they are the question mark titles that are still

2587
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:31,740
yet to be announced. But, uh, I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't hedge my bets on it. I would bet

2588
02:41:31,740 --> 02:41:38,780
the question marks are probably up coming square titles. I bet, um, for spoken is going to be one

2589
02:41:38,780 --> 02:41:43,820
of the games that has music that gets added into a theater of them. Although maybe that would be

2590
02:41:43,820 --> 02:41:47,340
a little weird. Oh no. Cause the game's gonna be on PlayStation as well. So you don't even have the

2591
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:53,740
switch versus PlayStation issue there. So that's just, or five has he 16 at that point will be out.

2592
02:41:53,740 --> 02:41:58,860
So it would make sense that a DLC pack would have the 16 music. Well, they also have that,

2593
02:41:58,860 --> 02:42:05,820
uh, seven. What was that? Um, gosh, I don't remember the, the, uh, seven prequel thing.

2594
02:42:05,820 --> 02:42:13,260
Yeah. Um, crisis core. Yeah. Crisis. I don't know if they're adding new music to the

2595
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:18,060
remake that they're doing fifth dream and chat says do simple and clean, then get the fuck out.

2596
02:42:18,060 --> 02:42:22,620
But then you have to pay Utada money to do that. And you know, they have every right to

2597
02:42:22,620 --> 02:42:28,540
money as well from that, you know, collaboration so forth. So the Japanese one, cause it's better.

2598
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:33,740
Well, ideally we could select either one, but I'm not, I'm not, I don't think simple and clean was

2599
02:42:33,740 --> 02:42:38,140
even a melody of mediocrity probably because they didn't work out a deal with Utada. I don't think

2600
02:42:38,140 --> 02:42:44,300
any of their songs are in it. I could be wrong. You're going to put anyone in there. Do kiss me.

2601
02:42:44,300 --> 02:42:50,860
Goodbye. Cause, um, Angela Aki, I love her as Joe and her mat says, Rob is just throwing his

2602
02:42:50,860 --> 02:42:55,660
bank account at this game for the complete pack. True. I will be buying the complete pack. I'm just

2603
02:42:55,660 --> 02:43:00,060
still deciding if I want it on PlayStation or if I want it on switch, I think I'm going to end up

2604
02:43:00,060 --> 02:43:06,060
getting it on switch. The portable element to play it on a plane is pretty enticing, but yeah,

2605
02:43:06,060 --> 02:43:11,900
will I be dropping a hundred dollars on the Uber Edison? Yep. It's me. I'm the problem.

2606
02:43:12,700 --> 02:43:17,500
All right, let's get to the list. That's not a problem because they're giving you content.

2607
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:21,580
Yeah, you're right. The content is there. There's a difference between a hundred dollar loop box

2608
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:25,740
where you don't know what's in it and a hundred dollars worth of content that they've outlined.

2609
02:43:25,740 --> 02:43:30,300
It's basically a digital collector's edition is what that is. Honestly, there's like 400 songs

2610
02:43:30,300 --> 02:43:33,660
in Final Fantasy 14. If they were like, we're going to loop box the remainder of the Final

2611
02:43:33,660 --> 02:43:42,700
Fantasy 14 soundtrack, I'd be like, I'm part problem. All right, let's move on to the listener

2612
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:46,460
round table. We're going to start with our mailbag because I don't see anybody in the green room,

2613
02:43:46,460 --> 02:43:51,340
but I will get to tweets here in a minute, but let's read this quickly. Yep. Participate

2614
02:43:51,340 --> 02:43:57,340
at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us emails. Hello peoples. So I'm at home after dinner

2615
02:43:57,340 --> 02:44:01,340
with my family and catching up on episodes of X-Play on G4, which I'm watching on my DVR because

2616
02:44:01,340 --> 02:44:05,260
I subscribe to cable. Currently I'm watching an episode where they're doing a retrospective of

2617
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:09,500
the Xbox one versions of Madden. It's interesting to see the opinionists talk about a product that's

2618
02:44:09,500 --> 02:44:13,500
gone stale over the past few years, but not interesting enough for me to watch the episodes

2619
02:44:13,500 --> 02:44:18,940
of X-Play as they're released. I'm watching an episode from a month ago and advertisers on

2620
02:44:18,940 --> 02:44:24,540
television pay a higher value on people who watch their ads when their ads are current. What could

2621
02:44:24,540 --> 02:44:30,700
G4 do to get people to watch their cable content in a more current fashion? Esports. About the only

2622
02:44:30,780 --> 02:44:35,340
thing keeping cable television afloat right now aside from house flipper shows that are

2623
02:44:35,340 --> 02:44:41,340
on in the background as I'm getting my nails done is live sports. Why did Turner and ESPN pay 24

2624
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:48,860
billion for their rights to air NBA games? Why did CBS, NBC, Fox, and ESPN pay 39.6 billion for

2625
02:44:48,860 --> 02:44:53,820
their rights to NFL games? Why are networks in Europe willing to pay 13.5 billion for Premier

2626
02:44:53,820 --> 02:44:59,180
League football? Because people who watch sports tend to watch it live as it's happening, whether

2627
02:44:59,180 --> 02:45:02,620
it's at home on the couch or at a bar with friends or in the background as you're making dinner,

2628
02:45:02,620 --> 02:45:07,180
people tend to watch sports live as it's happening. G4 could do what other cable networks

2629
02:45:07,180 --> 02:45:11,820
are doing by airing esports competitions live as they are happening. Yes, G4 does air esports

2630
02:45:11,820 --> 02:45:16,220
competitions, but these competitions are not live as they're happening. Live does mean as they're

2631
02:45:16,220 --> 02:45:21,660
happening for the record. Yes, these competitions are also available on Twitch, but G4 could air

2632
02:45:21,660 --> 02:45:28,700
these competitions live as well. All it would take is G4's parent company Comcast to be willing to

2633
02:45:28,780 --> 02:45:33,100
put forth a substantial investment in this platform and therein lies the problem. If you

2634
02:45:33,100 --> 02:45:38,940
watch things on a DVR on Comcast Cable like I do, eventually you'll see a screensaver come up. Often

2635
02:45:38,940 --> 02:45:43,980
these screensavers promote things that are available via Comcast. Currently one of the

2636
02:45:43,980 --> 02:45:48,620
Comcast DVR screens promote their customers getting access to Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

2637
02:45:48,620 --> 02:45:54,620
Live Beta. Now is there anything on this particular screensaver promoting G4? No, despite the fact that

2638
02:45:54,620 --> 02:46:01,180
it all would take is putting the G4 logo on the side of the screensaver. If Comcast is willing to

2639
02:46:01,180 --> 02:46:04,860
put a single logo on one of their screensaver slides, what makes you think Comcast is willing

2640
02:46:04,860 --> 02:46:09,900
to invest in anything having to do with G4? Take care of entertainment. Well, thank you for the

2641
02:46:09,900 --> 02:46:14,860
email, Redertainment, and you do make some very good points. I think especially when you hit on

2642
02:46:14,860 --> 02:46:19,820
the fact that one thing that compels people to watch television is live events. Sports is the

2643
02:46:19,820 --> 02:46:25,980
biggest one, of course, but even reality TV like American Idol, when that show was a little more

2644
02:46:25,980 --> 02:46:30,380
relevant, I think the reason why was because there was so much of that live element to it

2645
02:46:30,380 --> 02:46:37,660
that really made it must-see TV, or the news is live and so forth, and still it makes local TV

2646
02:46:37,660 --> 02:46:43,340
relevant and so forth. So I do think you hit on something there, but again, we had additional news

2647
02:46:43,340 --> 02:46:49,020
about G4 this week. Now, Frost is leaving, who's the only one that's given them a truly viral

2648
02:46:49,020 --> 02:46:54,380
moment. Kevin Pereira, I believe, is leaving now as well. So it's kind of like one of those,

2649
02:46:54,380 --> 02:46:58,780
you know, it's too early to eulogize G4, you know, maybe something comes through with the

2650
02:46:58,780 --> 02:47:06,700
cost-saving initiatives, but I just, I think when it comes to video game media, G4 is one of many

2651
02:47:06,700 --> 02:47:12,140
participants in that conversation at this point. And that's the way I can put it, like, without

2652
02:47:12,140 --> 02:47:17,820
making it sound like I'm dogging on G4, because I'm not, but it's just G4 has to compete with a

2653
02:47:17,820 --> 02:47:23,900
lot of other people in the room now. And that wasn't the case, you know, 10, 15 years ago,

2654
02:47:23,900 --> 02:47:28,300
when G4 was more of the traditional TV network, and that's all you had, because people didn't

2655
02:47:28,300 --> 02:47:31,580
have the internet fast enough to create their own television. So.

2656
02:47:33,020 --> 02:47:37,820
On top of that, with the eSports stuff, it's a good idea, but at the same time, I think that's

2657
02:47:37,820 --> 02:47:43,900
already being broadcast on like ESPN. So I'm assuming that there's some sort of rights exchange

2658
02:47:43,900 --> 02:47:48,940
that's going on there. They're not just doing it for the, out of the goodness of their heart. So

2659
02:47:48,940 --> 02:47:55,340
I'm wondering if they can't purchase the rights to that because it's already been purchased.

2660
02:47:55,340 --> 02:47:59,900
And not to mention, if they're going to cost save, they don't have the money to do it.

2661
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:07,500
All right, I'm going into some tweets real quick. The vast majority of the tweets we were tagged in

2662
02:48:07,500 --> 02:48:12,620
last week, the vast majority had to do with Dark Sakura being on the Stadia Doshid show

2663
02:48:13,180 --> 02:48:18,140
last week, just because they were tagging us and they have fans that were retweeting and

2664
02:48:18,140 --> 02:48:21,420
hearting. And it seems like your appearance was really, really well received over there.

2665
02:48:22,300 --> 02:48:26,380
All I noticed was it was a long listen, so I haven't listened yet, but maybe that's something

2666
02:48:26,380 --> 02:48:31,260
for airline travel when I get around to it, because I did see the YouTube that was posted.

2667
02:48:31,260 --> 02:48:37,180
But yeah, thanks to Stadia Doshid for the multiple shout outs and sounds like you had

2668
02:48:37,180 --> 02:48:41,500
a really good time there and made some new fans over there at the Stadia Doshid show. Thanks.

2669
02:48:41,580 --> 02:48:47,260
Absolutely had a fantastic time. I really enjoyed it. I would do it again in a heartbeat.

2670
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:53,900
I will say, I believe this tweet that came to us is from one of those people that came to us from

2671
02:48:53,900 --> 02:48:59,180
the Stadia Doshid show who tweeted us. It's on Twitter, Dustin Arand. And if you want to tweet

2672
02:48:59,180 --> 02:49:04,380
us, by the way, it's at OLR who said, hey, great show. I have some counters to some points. Number

2673
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:07,420
one, we don't accept those here, actually. I'm going to move on. No, of course, every gamer has

2674
02:49:07,420 --> 02:49:11,260
a voice, so let's get to these. Number one, Ubisoft does have their own subscription on

2675
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:16,060
console and the cloud. It's called Ubisoft Plus, and it's free to try until October 10th.

2676
02:49:17,660 --> 02:49:23,660
I forgot about that. I plumbed, but you know what? You have to install that. I shouldn't have forgot

2677
02:49:23,660 --> 02:49:30,540
because you have to install that fricking shell to get Assassin's Creed Odyssey on the PC. I don't

2678
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:33,100
know if you know that, but with- I'm on a Mac.

2679
02:49:33,100 --> 02:49:39,900
Well, I know you do the cloud stuff, but I'm playing because of Game Pass and Game Pass PC.

2680
02:49:41,100 --> 02:49:45,340
It's not like the other games where it installs directly in Game Pass. You have to download the

2681
02:49:45,340 --> 02:49:51,180
Ubi thing and Game Pass basically talks to the Ubi thing and enables it on your account that way,

2682
02:49:51,180 --> 02:49:55,900
which is interesting. It used to be Uplay back in the day, but then yeah, like the

2683
02:49:55,900 --> 02:50:02,300
Twitter user saying, Dustin is saying, it's the Ubisoft Plus thing now is what it is. But I forgot

2684
02:50:02,300 --> 02:50:07,420
that it was also like a whole cloud subscription thing and you could get their whole library.

2685
02:50:07,420 --> 02:50:14,540
So yeah, good point. Good point. And then as another G4 comment, as far as G4 and cable

2686
02:50:14,540 --> 02:50:20,300
and leaks us to an article called Cable TV is the New Landline, which is kind of a point I was

2687
02:50:20,300 --> 02:50:25,980
trying to make last week, an article from the New York Times, due to our own timeframe tonight,

2688
02:50:25,980 --> 02:50:30,140
I'm not going to go through the article on air. I did read it off air when you first sent us the

2689
02:50:30,140 --> 02:50:36,380
tweet and it was really reemphasizing a lot of things I kind of thought I was saying last week

2690
02:50:36,380 --> 02:50:45,420
about yeah, cable TV is not going to be what it is now in another 20 years. And things change,

2691
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:52,380
technology changes. That's okay. You don't see as many people rocking satellite dishes as you

2692
02:50:52,380 --> 02:50:59,100
used to, unless you live in a place that can't get service in any other manner. I realized-

2693
02:50:59,660 --> 02:51:01,420
Stay tuned is irrelevant.

2694
02:51:01,420 --> 02:51:09,020
If you're in Alaska, satellite is huge. And then Dustin says one more tweet that says,

2695
02:51:09,020 --> 02:51:13,660
whoever mentioned Crypt of the NecroDancer on the show, I got that on sale a month ago and I've been

2696
02:51:13,660 --> 02:51:18,620
addicted ever since. Got it for Switch too. Well, make sure you probably already know this if you're

2697
02:51:18,620 --> 02:51:24,060
a Switch user, but make sure you look out for Cadence of Hyrule as well. It's the same fricking

2698
02:51:24,060 --> 02:51:28,780
game from the same developers, but it's Zelda stuff. So even if you're not super into Zelda,

2699
02:51:28,860 --> 02:51:32,940
which I don't think many gamers would say that, but I'm sure there's some out there,

2700
02:51:33,980 --> 02:51:40,940
that was definitely worth a look would be Cadence of Hyrule if you are not already in that.

2701
02:51:42,060 --> 02:51:47,900
All right. Awesome. So I don't see anybody in the green room and that is a-okay because we're right

2702
02:51:47,900 --> 02:51:51,900
about nine o'clock anyway. I hope I wasn't discouraging people from calling in, but we'll

2703
02:51:51,900 --> 02:51:59,660
try again next week over at vognetwork.com slash discord. If nothing else, join the discord,

2704
02:51:59,660 --> 02:52:04,380
talk to us throughout the week, send us your comments, send us some other things you have

2705
02:52:04,380 --> 02:52:08,700
to say, cause I love to read them throughout the week. So vognetwork.com slash discord. And of

2706
02:52:08,700 --> 02:52:15,260
course the tweets are great too. Stadia fans and all gaming fans, twitter.com slash O-L-R for

2707
02:52:15,260 --> 02:52:20,460
whatever tweets you may have for us. And I hope we can join on some other podcasts as well out

2708
02:52:20,460 --> 02:52:24,780
there in the coming weeks. We love guesting on other shows, all of us. I'd love to have

2709
02:52:26,300 --> 02:52:31,660
them on. I think it would be awesome. Ever since we went virtual, we haven't really had a lot of

2710
02:52:31,660 --> 02:52:35,180
guests on the show. I think we have to figure out what the format for that looks like. So we're not

2711
02:52:35,180 --> 02:52:40,860
asking somebody to commit three whole hours to be here, but yeah, I'm all for bringing lots of it.

2712
02:52:40,860 --> 02:52:45,820
I think you and I know about Between Us, probably like at least 25 Twitch streamers we'd love to

2713
02:52:45,820 --> 02:52:53,100
bring on this show, if not more. So yeah. I would be down for it. I still kind of want to do

2714
02:52:53,100 --> 02:52:59,820
like my Dead by Daylight sort of themed one where interviews are conducted as a character.

2715
02:52:59,820 --> 02:53:05,020
Yeah. I think it would be funny. Bobby in chat says lies you've had Shane several times,

2716
02:53:05,020 --> 02:53:08,780
not for the whole show though. So yeah, we usually, and that's probably the way to do

2717
02:53:08,780 --> 02:53:12,220
it with a guest is we invite them in to talk about the kickoff topic. And usually when I've

2718
02:53:12,220 --> 02:53:17,180
had Shane on, or I think there was somebody else too in one episode, it's about the kickoff topic

2719
02:53:17,180 --> 02:53:21,980
and so forth. So we can always kind of shape the show that way, but we'll talk about that

2720
02:53:21,980 --> 02:53:25,260
another time. For now, we're going to wrap it up. Dark Soccer, I know you're about to head out

2721
02:53:26,220 --> 02:53:29,820
and do your thing. Do you want to give us a final thought tonight before you head out?

2722
02:53:30,620 --> 02:53:31,340
A Wesker.

2723
02:53:33,660 --> 02:53:36,860
Well said. All right. Bye, Jamie. Have a good stream.

2724
02:53:36,860 --> 02:53:37,980
Later taters.

2725
02:53:37,980 --> 02:53:42,540
All right. And of course, I'm going to say as always, thank you for downloading and listening

2726
02:53:42,540 --> 02:53:46,780
to Orange Lawns Radio, whether it was on the podcast feed or you were here live. I appreciate

2727
02:53:46,780 --> 02:53:51,740
you being a part of the show. You can always leave us a nice five-star review on iTunes or Spotify,

2728
02:53:51,740 --> 02:53:56,860
or wherever it is you found this podcast. Those reviews go an awful long way in those kind words.

2729
02:53:56,860 --> 02:54:01,260
We want to grow our family here at Orange Lawns Radio and Vogue Network. We can only do that.

2730
02:54:01,260 --> 02:54:06,060
They're bringing more people in here and spreading the word. So tell a friend or two about the show.

2731
02:54:06,060 --> 02:54:09,740
Thank you so much to those of you that do. I don't say that enough. I do see that there

2732
02:54:09,740 --> 02:54:13,100
are people that do that. I appreciate the shout outs. I appreciate the tweets.

2733
02:54:13,100 --> 02:54:15,740
All of that stuff is great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for those that do that.

2734
02:54:17,740 --> 02:54:21,660
That's it. Let's get final thoughts and get on out of here. Loki, your final thought tonight.

2735
02:54:23,260 --> 02:54:28,060
Almost done with this bill. I can't wait. Probably another day or so and I'll have it done.

2736
02:54:28,060 --> 02:54:34,700
And then a video this week for sure. It's been three weeks and I feel real bad about it. But

2737
02:54:35,580 --> 02:54:41,260
you know, considering everything that was going on and then the size of the bill. Yeah,

2738
02:54:41,260 --> 02:54:48,700
it's understandable. My final thought. I'm going to stream on my personal stream Monday and Friday.

2739
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:52,860
Maybe. Well, I can't do Wednesday because work situation, but maybe Thursday night. I'm still

2740
02:54:52,860 --> 02:54:59,340
trying to figure out a good game to do Thursday night. I'm kind of on the fence between streaming

2741
02:54:59,340 --> 02:55:04,140
those Atari recharge games. I might get a couple more of them and stream those. Bone Champ. Or

2742
02:55:05,260 --> 02:55:08,940
well, yeah, there's always Trombone Champ. But I'm also thinking Splatoon three. I think I got

2743
02:55:08,940 --> 02:55:11,820
to get on board with that eventually. I'm kind of waiting to hear if they've patched some of

2744
02:55:11,820 --> 02:55:16,380
the communication issues, because that's the big thing that's been ticking me off about that. So

2745
02:55:16,380 --> 02:55:20,140
it's not so I'm playing that. I don't know if it's any good, but he likes it. Is he getting

2746
02:55:20,140 --> 02:55:24,940
disconnected? I think he's just been playing the single player. Oh, OK. Yeah, there is always that.

2747
02:55:24,940 --> 02:55:31,740
I could always just play that. But I still I don't really want to reward Nintendo for their crappy

2748
02:55:31,740 --> 02:55:35,580
online, but we'll see. We'll see. I otherwise have been hearing good things about the game.

2749
02:55:35,580 --> 02:55:39,340
A lot of tweets about this flat fest this weekend. So we'll see. We'll see.

2750
02:55:39,340 --> 02:55:41,900
Even less of an excuse now that we have to pay for it, you know?

2751
02:55:41,900 --> 02:55:47,100
Yeah, right. All right. But that is it. Thank you so much. Thanks for listening to Orange

2752
02:55:47,100 --> 02:55:51,260
Lounge Radio. Thank you so much for being here. We will see you next week. Have a wonderful week,
