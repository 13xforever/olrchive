00:00.000 --> 00:12.800
This week's axiom is Cunningham's Law, which states,

00:12.800 --> 00:16.200
The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's

00:16.200 --> 00:17.600
to post the wrong answer.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.760
This was proven true again by game developers aplenty proving a foolhardy tweet wrong that

00:21.760 --> 00:25.180
quote unquote confirmed that Grand Theft Auto 6 will look bad.

00:25.180 --> 00:26.800
Too bad the game isn't done yet.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.520
This is the lightest update on the latest AAA gaming bombshell.

00:29.520 --> 00:32.680
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

00:32.680 --> 00:35.600
this story and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where

00:35.600 --> 00:37.480
every gamer has a voice.

00:37.480 --> 00:44.920
Hello my friends out there on the Internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:44.920 --> 00:47.360
where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.780
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:49.780 --> 00:54.400
We are live once again with episode number 931.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.400
That's a lot of shows.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.460
For tonight, September 25th of 2022.

00:58.460 --> 01:03.060
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as always by my co-hosts.

01:03.060 --> 01:07.780
Say hello first off to, she's working on her TwitchCon cosplay here.

01:07.780 --> 01:10.920
I would say the last minute but it isn't because there's still two weeks.

01:10.920 --> 01:19.660
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers who's, who's, oh, sorry, your noise gate is unforgiving

01:19.660 --> 01:20.660
sometimes.

01:20.660 --> 01:21.660
Sorry.

01:21.660 --> 01:22.660
How are you?

01:22.660 --> 01:23.660
I'm doing all right.

01:23.660 --> 01:27.100
I am recovering from a migraine and, sorry.

01:27.100 --> 01:32.140
Oh, it happens, you know, but I have crackle paste.

01:32.140 --> 01:39.340
I ruined the last mask I was working on so I emergency ordered another one.

01:39.340 --> 01:48.260
And my foam crafting is also not going to plan so I am putting crackle paste on this

01:48.260 --> 01:51.620
mask to make the Phantom of the Opera.

01:51.620 --> 01:55.440
No, that would be a half mask anyway.

01:55.480 --> 02:03.520
I am doing the Rift cosmetic for the pig, at least the, the crown, the reverse bear

02:03.520 --> 02:11.240
trap crown with her jigsaw mask and I realized that it would be a lot easier and a lot more

02:11.240 --> 02:17.520
authentic looking if I just use crackle paste and instead of painting.

02:17.520 --> 02:22.560
I would hope that if you are going to cosplay at TwitchCon, you're doing something related

02:22.560 --> 02:28.120
to Dead by Daylight since it is the game that really, it took you, you and Twitch's

02:28.120 --> 02:29.760
relationship to the next level.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.580
I would say the Dead by Daylight community.

02:32.580 --> 02:36.720
You remember I had been streaming and then kind of got bullied off.

02:36.720 --> 02:42.080
Yeah, which stinks, but then you found a pretty accepting community.

02:42.080 --> 02:52.040
So I did and funny enough, I made a friend at the Jiffy Lube who plays Dead by Daylight.

02:52.040 --> 02:58.400
He and his lady friend do and so I may have new friends to play with.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.400
That's awesome.

02:59.400 --> 03:03.960
I know it seems like unfortunately, because my schedule, whatever, we never seem to be

03:03.960 --> 03:08.680
able to connect to play Dead by Daylight on stream, but I hope we can soon, so it'll be

03:08.680 --> 03:09.680
fun.

03:09.680 --> 03:14.840
I play with Phonara quite a bit, but you know, and I always enjoy playing with Phonara, but

03:14.840 --> 03:20.880
I like to expand a little bit and play, you know, give my other friends a chance to enjoy

03:20.880 --> 03:21.880
my presence.

03:21.880 --> 03:22.880
Sure, sure.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.560
I mean, humbly speaking, of course.

03:25.560 --> 03:30.400
We have over in chat over at twitch.tv slash a vog network because we do tape live every

03:30.400 --> 03:34.320
Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black

03:34.320 --> 03:35.320
Wolf show.

03:35.320 --> 03:39.480
SSJ 100 Matt is wishing you happy Jewish New Year in chat, which I know we were talking

03:39.480 --> 03:40.560
about just before the show.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.560
So.

03:41.560 --> 03:42.560
Thank you.

03:42.560 --> 03:49.620
Thank you for being here tonight in spite of that going on.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.900
Can you believe the TwitchCon is just in two weeks?

03:51.900 --> 03:55.700
Like I was just, you know, kind of thinking about that sales like, oh, my gosh, like,

03:55.700 --> 03:56.700
I'm not ready.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.420
Well, I feel like DragonCon just happened.

03:59.420 --> 04:04.780
And certainly a lot of that was the coat was it did, but it was also the COVID sandbag

04:04.780 --> 04:07.860
that took me out of real life for a couple of weeks.

04:07.860 --> 04:11.540
And now now that things are getting up and going again, I'm like, oh, Snapple, there's

04:11.540 --> 04:13.260
TwitchCon coming up in two weeks.

04:13.260 --> 04:18.620
And did you get the email, by the way, that they're sending out with about your vaccination

04:18.620 --> 04:19.620
and all of that?

04:19.620 --> 04:20.620
Yes.

04:20.620 --> 04:21.620
Everything is up today.

04:21.620 --> 04:23.020
I'm getting this shit everywhere.

04:23.020 --> 04:24.340
I signed up for the clear.

04:24.340 --> 04:28.520
So they're using that clear service, which is you starting to see in more and more airports.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.580
This is not an endorsement.

04:29.580 --> 04:30.580
I've never used it.

04:30.580 --> 04:31.580
I just see it all the time.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.820
I didn't know they did COVID health pass stuff.

04:33.820 --> 04:38.100
But apparently you can do that as well to I don't know if it's cut the line or skip

04:38.100 --> 04:42.000
the line or just maybe it's like TSA pre-check, you have a shorter line.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.720
So I did all that stuff today because you have to take a bunch of pictures and send

04:45.720 --> 04:46.720
that all over.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.520
I could do that.

04:48.520 --> 04:55.540
You actually remind me that I need to update my record because I just had the newest booster.

04:55.540 --> 05:01.360
And everyone, unless you have a medically mandated reason that you cannot physically

05:01.360 --> 05:05.360
take the booster, I don't want to hear your excuse.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.440
I don't want to hear it.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.440
I want to get it.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.520
I'm just trying to figure out the right time to do it.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.200
So you're quoting religion to do it.

05:12.200 --> 05:19.600
Don't you think that your deity of choice would want you to be healthy so that you can

05:19.600 --> 05:23.400
continue to contribute to said faith?

05:23.400 --> 05:27.400
Yeah, just trust all of us that have had COVID.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.400
You don't want it.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.800
And I'm sure at this point, I imagine more of our listeners have had it than haven't.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.900
And we can also tell you that as well.

05:34.900 --> 05:41.300
So anyway, I am, by the way, going to step away for a moment because this was the poorly

05:41.300 --> 05:42.300
thought out idea.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.300
You're fine.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.300
Because I also have to introduce Techmaster Loki.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.300
Hi, Loki.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.300
Hello.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.300
Hi.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.300
How are you?

05:48.300 --> 05:49.600
I'm doing fine.

05:49.600 --> 05:54.820
So I notice you do have a game that plays behind you every week as we are broadcasting

05:54.820 --> 05:55.820
live here on Twitch.

05:55.820 --> 06:01.800
I know the podcast listeners can't see it, but I will tell them I easily know that game

06:01.800 --> 06:06.900
because that is the game that I would call the it girl game of Twitch right now.

06:06.900 --> 06:11.460
Because usually there's some games that will be like the it girl of Twitch for a couple

06:11.460 --> 06:12.460
of weeks.

06:12.460 --> 06:15.300
And I would say the last one, maybe still a little bit, was Cult of the Lamb, was very

06:15.300 --> 06:17.300
much the it girl on Twitch.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.800
Maybe before that, I'm trying to think of some of the other it girl games that kind

06:19.800 --> 06:20.800
of like came and went.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.180
Well, Disney, Dreamlight Valley, it seems like a lot of people are doing, but anyway.

06:24.180 --> 06:25.180
Still the it girl.

06:25.180 --> 06:27.940
You have, you are playing trombone champ.

06:27.940 --> 06:30.100
I keep wanting to say trombone hero, but that isn't it.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.540
It's trombone champ is actual name of it.

06:32.540 --> 06:34.680
We don't want to be copyright.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.040
They don't want to be in legal trouble with Activision.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.040
Yes.

06:38.040 --> 06:41.360
And I noticed the thing about trombone champ that's interesting is that most of the music,

06:41.360 --> 06:47.880
if not all of it, is either like public domain or some sort of, you know, song that is in

06:47.880 --> 06:52.640
the public consciousness where they can easily put it into the game.

06:52.640 --> 06:57.080
Like there's a lot of classic songs like Beethoven, Bach, and then there's things like, you know,

06:57.080 --> 06:59.840
I think Hava Nagila is one of the songs where it's things where it's like they're public

06:59.840 --> 07:00.840
domain songs.

07:00.840 --> 07:01.840
That's a hard one.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.840
Yeah.

07:02.840 --> 07:03.840
Yeah.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.120
So, you know, we're longtime music game fans, and I'm sure you want to talk a little more

07:08.120 --> 07:13.200
about this game during your gaming week, but what do you think it is about this game that

07:13.200 --> 07:17.280
is making it the girl of Twitch right now?

07:17.280 --> 07:19.920
It's not taking itself seriously.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.660
For one, it's really strange.

07:21.660 --> 07:22.880
It's a strange game.

07:22.880 --> 07:31.800
It's kind of almost got all that, like, like it's like weird elements to it, kind of like

07:31.800 --> 07:35.840
cookie clicker almost, you know, where it has like, it's like, oh, it's a game about

07:35.840 --> 07:36.840
cookies.

07:36.840 --> 07:37.840
Wait, now there's Eldritch demons.

07:37.840 --> 07:38.840
What?

07:38.840 --> 07:39.840
Yeah.

07:39.840 --> 07:40.920
It's like weird stuff like that.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.640
So this one, it's, it's, it's, you know, it's a trombone game with a character.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.320
It looks like it could be a me.

07:47.320 --> 07:55.880
And then there's also tons of baboons and the chaotic demon and it's like Dark Souls

07:55.880 --> 07:56.880
is weird.

07:56.880 --> 08:00.040
It's frog fractions, but it's trombones basically.

08:00.040 --> 08:08.040
Kinda, not kinda, by the way, if you've never experienced the genius that is frog fractions,

08:08.040 --> 08:11.640
I don't even know if the game is still up and running somewhere, but it's, I think it's,

08:11.640 --> 08:12.640
it's on steam.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.640
I think.

08:13.640 --> 08:14.640
Oh wait.

08:14.640 --> 08:15.640
Oh, that's right.

08:15.640 --> 08:16.640
I think they did release on Steve.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.000
So it's really one of the most incredible gaming experiences you'll ever experience

08:18.000 --> 08:19.280
is frog fractions.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.280
There was a sequel.

08:20.280 --> 08:24.120
I sort of think at that point when you knew what the gag was, I think the sequel kind

08:24.120 --> 08:28.920
of lost effectiveness, but, uh, it's, it's, it's still worth the time was that you didn't

08:28.920 --> 08:31.760
know it was frog fractions too, because it was a different game.

08:31.760 --> 08:32.760
Yes.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.920
And that was the running gag on this show for many shows for a long time was, Oh, this

08:35.920 --> 08:37.040
new weird thing.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.880
Is this frog fractions too?

08:38.880 --> 08:42.240
Is it, is trombone champ frogs fractions too?

08:42.240 --> 08:46.880
No, it's, it's a, it's a fun yet challenging game.

08:46.880 --> 08:47.880
That's for sure.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.960
This isn't the first I've heard of it.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.440
Oh, it's, you know what the, you know, the funny thing about it.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.440
Okay.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.880
So as a music game fan, the actual music game itself, this is literally theater them.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.880
There's three different stage types and theater them.

09:01.880 --> 09:05.560
It's not the one you see the most, but I believe this is the cut scene one where you're just

09:05.560 --> 09:11.160
going up and down and tracing the note it's theater them, but it's theater them with the

09:11.160 --> 09:16.520
trombone and the it's the sense of humor that makes it so that like when you miss notes,

09:16.520 --> 09:18.360
it says nasty.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.720
And when you, Oh, it's the battle stages says Mike Deft.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.080
I thought, no, that those are the ones you commonly see.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.700
This is the one, I think it's the cut scene ones, the movie stages where you are tracing

09:26.700 --> 09:28.360
the note lines and everything.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.120
It's really, it's the same mechanic.

09:30.120 --> 09:35.240
It's just going the opposite direction, which I guess the default mode for the trombone

09:35.240 --> 09:37.000
is also down as up and up as down.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Right.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Because that's the way trombone would work.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.680
No, I fixed that right away.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.600
But it's just, if you listen to it.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.600
What about valve trombone?

09:45.600 --> 09:49.320
I don't think they add any of the other mechanics and that, yeah.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.600
But it's the, it's the noise that the trombone makes.

09:52.600 --> 09:56.680
That's really funny when you're messing up and that's what, and the fact that they call

09:56.680 --> 10:01.000
them tromboners, when you play a trombone, you're a tromboner, which isn't actually what

10:01.000 --> 10:05.200
they're called, but it's, that's part, part, part of the humor in the game.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.200
That's what we called them in high school.

10:08.200 --> 10:12.760
I feel like the people that made this game absolutely were band nerds in the trombone

10:12.760 --> 10:13.760
section.

10:13.760 --> 10:14.760
Like the, and these are all in jokes.

10:14.760 --> 10:19.360
It's hilarious though, is they have like trading cards you can unlock and like booster packs

10:19.360 --> 10:20.360
and stuff like that.

10:20.360 --> 10:25.420
But they're like of like classic trombone musicians was like, who's collecting that.

10:25.420 --> 10:26.900
But it's just ridiculous.

10:26.900 --> 10:30.020
So which Neville brother is in there?

10:30.020 --> 10:34.380
Well, I was just, I hope you, you cannot have a ska band without a trombone.

10:34.380 --> 10:36.760
Like a trombone is an essential part of any ska band.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.620
So I think they do have a ska track in there.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.780
I'm pretty sure there is.

10:41.780 --> 10:46.620
There's also, was it that, that, that track from, um, 2001, a space odyssey?

10:46.620 --> 10:47.620
Oh yeah.

10:47.620 --> 10:48.620
Oh yeah.

10:48.620 --> 10:49.620
Well, that's a classic.

10:49.620 --> 10:50.620
Zarathustra.

10:50.620 --> 10:51.620
That's a classic.

10:51.620 --> 10:52.620
Yeah.

10:52.820 --> 10:57.900
For the record, here's a true story about me as a band nerd.

10:57.900 --> 11:05.660
I wanted to play trombone and, uh, I wasn't allowed to play trombone because apparently

11:05.660 --> 11:09.300
I don't have the correct shaped mouth to play trombone.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.820
So I played saxophone instead.

11:11.820 --> 11:12.820
Hmm.

11:12.820 --> 11:16.940
Well, I think if they make a sequel to this game, it won't be saxophone champ.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.340
It'll be tuba champ.

11:18.340 --> 11:21.540
It seems likely the likely sequel to this game.

11:21.540 --> 11:26.620
Well, and the other thing, I still want a sax master.

11:26.620 --> 11:29.500
And the other thing I want to say, and then I want to get into the news and stuff is that

11:29.500 --> 11:34.100
with this game, uh, you know, I keep saying it's the girl on Twitch because it went extremely

11:34.100 --> 11:35.540
viral on Twitter.

11:35.540 --> 11:39.140
And I was very surprised that the people that were tweeting this, like all these verified

11:39.140 --> 11:43.780
accounts, including like one of the MSNBC news anchors, like quote, tweeted it and said,

11:43.780 --> 11:45.940
this is the laugh I needed today or something like that.

11:45.940 --> 11:51.060
Like just the little clip of people playing the trombone horribly, I think speaks to all

11:51.100 --> 11:55.180
of us that have ever joined bands successfully or otherwise.

11:55.180 --> 11:56.700
So I think it does.

11:56.700 --> 12:01.660
It does sound like a high school marching band, like practicing music that they are

12:01.660 --> 12:03.860
not familiar with is what it sounds like.

12:03.860 --> 12:06.540
Can you play it with a trombone MIDI controller?

12:06.540 --> 12:12.820
No, no, because that it's, it's, I don't think it's, it's not supposed to be serious, Jamie.

12:12.820 --> 12:14.820
It's a jokey kind of thing.

12:14.820 --> 12:20.140
So, but it shouldn't put like, like a support in there just to be hilarious because I think

12:20.140 --> 12:21.140
it would have been funny.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.540
And actually it's what the modding community's for.

12:23.540 --> 12:27.740
And Bobby said, so Bobby just said it in chat, not yet, but somebody's already modding it

12:27.740 --> 12:29.980
in the MIDI controller because of course they are.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.540
And they've already modded in other songs.

12:31.540 --> 12:32.540
I'm sure.

12:32.540 --> 12:36.980
I think I heard you were talking about a megalovania or whatever that song is from megalovania

12:36.980 --> 12:41.460
shows up in everything, but I was thinking like, how about some early, no doubt songs

12:41.460 --> 12:45.260
like back when they really were scar or some of the other like stuff from the nineties,

12:45.260 --> 12:49.700
you know, boss tones, there's any pain fans.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.900
I introduced you to pain a long time ago.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.340
Are they even still together?

12:54.340 --> 12:55.340
No.

12:55.340 --> 13:00.220
Um, Everest, they have another band that's formed since then, but like pose got like

13:00.220 --> 13:02.940
tenure at Georgia tech.

13:02.940 --> 13:08.220
And so the band kind of fell apart and now it's like a different band, but still pain

13:08.220 --> 13:11.420
is like one of the best bands to ever come out of the South.

13:11.420 --> 13:12.420
All right.

13:12.420 --> 13:13.420
All right.

13:13.420 --> 13:16.240
Maybe they'll show up in the DLC because, Hey, this game's going to make these, these

13:16.240 --> 13:17.240
folks money.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.880
So maybe they'll be able to put some money down for DLC.

13:19.880 --> 13:20.880
We'll see.

13:20.880 --> 13:21.880
We'll see.

13:21.880 --> 13:22.880
All right.

13:22.880 --> 13:23.880
Anyhow, let's move on.

13:23.880 --> 13:24.880
Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.160
We actually have a lot of like Twitch related topics tonight.

13:27.160 --> 13:30.200
I know it's interesting because Jamie and I are talking about Twitch con in a couple

13:30.200 --> 13:31.200
of weeks.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.880
Um, which, which will be the first time I've been in a long time.

13:35.880 --> 13:42.280
Um, I went the very first year, you may or may not recall, um, our voiceover guy, Jason

13:42.280 --> 13:44.280
took me the first year.

13:44.280 --> 13:49.120
Um, and it was, uh, at the Moscone center and we only, I only went for a day.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.440
Um, but that was where, you know, I, I learned a lot just walking around the show floor and

13:53.440 --> 13:56.880
talking to vendors and it really was motivating to like do Twitch.

13:56.880 --> 14:03.240
Um, I didn't quite stay on the wagon for a variety of reasons, but you know, a few years

14:03.240 --> 14:08.020
later when the necessity of VOG, the going through changes and shout cast and all that

14:08.020 --> 14:11.240
stuff, uh, kind of came up and we made the move to Twitch.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.600
You know, it was, it was, I was very thankful.

14:13.600 --> 14:17.480
I had experimented with Twitch before and kind of had some of that knowledge.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.760
In fact, the video capture card that is still in my PC, this new PC, this day I bought

14:21.760 --> 14:23.720
at that first Twitch con when I was there.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.980
So it'd be interesting to see how it's evolved all these years later.

14:26.980 --> 14:31.840
And now that I am a little more immersed in Twitch culture, not just through OLR, but

14:31.840 --> 14:35.880
you know, through my own streaming and participation as well as dark soccer, it'll just be interesting

14:35.880 --> 14:41.320
to see, you know, what this year looks like even just post pandemic, you know, so, well,

14:41.520 --> 14:45.640
Well, I shouldn't say post pandemic, post lockdowns we'll say.

14:45.640 --> 14:53.440
For the record, I actually have included my mask in with, uh, my, uh, what I'm calling

14:53.440 --> 15:03.520
my casual cosplay, where I have a little lower face mask that's a pig going.

15:03.520 --> 15:10.940
So if I need to, um, I have, I have my little pig, pig who half mask, but I'm going to make

15:10.940 --> 15:12.900
this, I'm going to make my cosmetic work.

15:12.900 --> 15:13.900
All right.

15:13.900 --> 15:18.100
Well, we'll do more, uh, Twitch con prep next week and, and try to figure out where people

15:18.100 --> 15:19.760
can find us and all that good stuff.

15:19.760 --> 15:24.020
So there's a variety of meetups going on, uh, throughout the, uh, con.

15:24.020 --> 15:26.420
So I'd love to meet some listeners if you're going to be there.

15:26.420 --> 15:30.060
Otherwise, there's a lot of streamers that I watch that I can't wait to hang out with

15:30.060 --> 15:31.060
and see.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.060
So, uh, it's going to be fun.

15:32.060 --> 15:33.060
My friends.

15:33.060 --> 15:34.060
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

15:34.060 --> 15:35.060
It's gonna be fun.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.060
Yeah.

15:36.060 --> 15:42.500
And, and if any, by the way, if, if any of the friends are listening, um, I'm going to

15:42.500 --> 15:47.460
be at Disneyland on the 10th and you're welcome to hang out with me.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.580
I will not be going sadly, nothing, nothing.

15:49.580 --> 15:53.840
I just, we, we booked a flight home on Monday and I can't miss too much work because we're

15:53.840 --> 15:57.100
also going to, don't forget, we're going to Seattle just like four more weeks.

15:57.100 --> 16:03.520
So it's, you know, I had reserved the time off before my schedule even changed just to

16:03.520 --> 16:04.660
be sure that I got it.

16:04.660 --> 16:08.780
And I'm very glad that I did because the days I scheduled off for the days, my schedule

16:08.780 --> 16:09.780
changed too.

16:09.780 --> 16:10.780
Nice.

16:10.780 --> 16:11.780
All right, let's move on.

16:11.780 --> 16:14.700
We got other stuff in gaming we want to get to Mike.

16:14.700 --> 16:20.300
We want to get tonight's kickoff topic, uh, which has to do, it's a little bit with Twitch

16:20.300 --> 16:24.700
culture, but I'd say this is more about the game in question, which has not been getting

16:24.700 --> 16:30.220
a lot of great reviews, uh, across the board, but continues to sell like hotcakes.

16:30.220 --> 16:32.740
Anyway, Loki, why don't you start us off here?

16:32.740 --> 16:34.580
I mean, it's not a surprise.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.580
It's the same old complaints over and over again.

16:36.580 --> 16:41.300
It's just, it's like EA is playing this game of how far can we push it before?

16:41.300 --> 16:43.180
It's too much.

16:43.180 --> 16:49.980
And maybe, maybe this time it was too much, but, um, so of course Madden players are upset

16:49.980 --> 16:58.660
over the fact that, um, in game gambling nods of the ultimate team stuff is, um, basically,

16:58.660 --> 17:04.540
I don't know if it's, um, that they don't have them in post yet.

17:04.540 --> 17:08.260
Basically it says, uh, you know, they need better odds, uh, better re-rolls better pack

17:08.260 --> 17:13.380
odds overall with bundles plus toppers, a hundred dollar version of promo bundles should

17:13.380 --> 17:19.100
be enough to complete a master full legend solos reward with B and D champion fantasy

17:19.100 --> 17:25.460
packs, at least top set pieces that can be added into sets to help NMS players.

17:25.460 --> 17:29.260
Um, I wouldn't be spending a hundred dollars on these packs, but whatever.

17:29.260 --> 17:34.940
Uh, so basically they're, the odds are getting harder to get, I guess, good players in those

17:34.940 --> 17:36.020
all the team things.

17:36.020 --> 17:40.260
So what they're doing now is announcing that they're going on pack strike, which makes

17:40.260 --> 17:45.600
sense because a lot of these streams, a lot of them are opening these ultimate team packs.

17:45.600 --> 17:49.480
And I mean, if you're getting like pretty bad polls, and I guess that also would impact

17:49.480 --> 17:54.320
your, your content negatively as well, but you're also paying the money, which is kind

17:54.320 --> 17:56.600
of perpetuating this problem in the first place.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.720
So kind of your fault.

17:58.720 --> 18:03.560
I mean, yeah, I was gonna say, look at Diablo immortal, like so many people were upset about

18:03.560 --> 18:07.640
the, you know, um, microtransaction or whatever you want to call it system in that game.

18:07.640 --> 18:14.060
Um, but because in part of all of these streamers buying into it anyway, and continuing to,

18:14.060 --> 18:17.680
you know, we had all these stories when that game was first out about thousands of dollars

18:17.680 --> 18:22.480
being poured into it and just encouraging others to do the same, that game is easily

18:22.480 --> 18:24.780
in the top 10 grossing mobile games.

18:24.780 --> 18:25.780
No problem.

18:25.780 --> 18:27.960
So message not received.

18:27.960 --> 18:32.280
It's not going to do anything because they've made so much money off of it at this point.

18:32.280 --> 18:33.640
Like it's too late.

18:33.640 --> 18:40.720
You the fact that you're still like, you know, the fact that you even considering, well,

18:40.720 --> 18:42.560
the hundred dollar pack should be enough.

18:42.560 --> 18:46.960
The fact that you're buying a $100 pack in this game in the first place is already a

18:46.960 --> 18:47.960
problem.

18:47.960 --> 18:53.560
Like, I would say yes, but I'm planning fully to drop $100 in theater them.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.320
And I don't want to think about how much I've spent on things like that by daily.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.920
Yeah, no, and I get that.

18:57.920 --> 19:03.400
But this isn't like, you know, you're paying $100 in theater at them to randomly get some

19:03.400 --> 19:04.400
songs.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.400
I know what I'm getting.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.400
Yeah, I know.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.400
In both of those circumstances.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.400
I know what I'm getting.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.280
It's a thing of is like a collector's edition or something like that.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.280
That would be different.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.240
Like if Madden had like a collector's edition, right?

19:15.240 --> 19:20.400
However stupid it would be to charge like say $120 for it or something that did have

19:20.400 --> 19:25.560
these cards in there, but it's they already know what they can get away with.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.440
I mean, hell, just look at the game.

19:27.440 --> 19:31.000
I mean, they're pretty much releasing the same product every year.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.760
They're taking features out holding them for a few years in the magical Disney vault, and

19:35.760 --> 19:39.640
then bringing them back later on and pretending Oh, look at this new feature that you this

19:39.640 --> 19:40.800
is why Madden is great.

19:40.800 --> 19:41.800
It's so innovative.

19:41.800 --> 19:45.280
And it's like this was just what you had a few years ago, except now you're calling it

19:45.280 --> 19:46.740
something different.

19:46.740 --> 19:52.040
So I mean, they already know their target audience just either doesn't care or is too

19:52.040 --> 19:53.640
stupid to figure it out.

19:53.640 --> 19:57.840
And so they are just whatever, we're gonna keep doing what we want, because you can complain

19:57.840 --> 20:01.200
about it all you want, create your hashtags and whatnot.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.760
It's not going to affect us in the least until it does and then they walk it back.

20:05.760 --> 20:09.660
But that's what happened with Star Wars because that was a single player game and stuff.

20:09.660 --> 20:14.340
But you see, whereas they walked it back loop boxes there.

20:14.340 --> 20:18.860
They just doubled down in FIFA and Madden, because they can get away with it there.

20:18.860 --> 20:22.860
I want to get to a couple comments from chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

20:22.860 --> 20:23.860
So SSU 100.

20:23.860 --> 20:26.620
Matt says it's good that the streamers are the ones striking on these.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.740
I wonder if the youtubers will as well.

20:28.740 --> 20:32.820
EA cares a lot about these content creators not pushing their product.

20:32.820 --> 20:35.940
But as we know, regardless what happens, folks will still buy the loot boxes.

20:35.940 --> 20:39.620
Yeah, I mean, and you also make a good point is I would say the strongest statement.

20:39.620 --> 20:44.380
You could make and this also ties into what red entertainment says tracks and theater

20:44.380 --> 20:48.820
them can last for several years, card packs and this year's model of Madden only work

20:48.820 --> 20:50.540
with this year's model of Madden.

20:50.540 --> 20:54.740
And in my opinion, the biggest statement these streamers could make would be, again, similar

20:54.740 --> 20:55.740
in the Diablo universe.

20:55.740 --> 20:59.620
You had a very large website about min maxing a max role.

20:59.620 --> 21:02.060
It's something I've something I didn't know a lot about at the time.

21:02.060 --> 21:06.180
But ever since I got back into Diablo three, as with Alan, like we've been using that site

21:06.180 --> 21:07.300
a lot.

21:07.300 --> 21:11.100
Max role pulled their coverage of Diablo immortal said, you know what, we're no longer covering

21:11.100 --> 21:12.100
this game.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.260
We're going to focus on Diablo two and Diablo three.

21:14.260 --> 21:16.820
We're not going to talk about immortal anymore, basically.

21:16.820 --> 21:21.920
And in my opinion, if the Madden streamers really want to make an impact, I would say

21:21.920 --> 21:24.420
continue to stream Madden 22.

21:24.420 --> 21:28.420
And don't even don't even acknowledge this new game for a variety of reasons.

21:28.420 --> 21:32.920
You know, again, it's I don't want to just shit on a sports game for the sake of shitting

21:32.920 --> 21:34.100
on a sports game.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.100
Like I understand.

21:35.100 --> 21:40.700
Well, but Darkseid, that's not fair, you know, because when they were shitting on DDR,

21:40.700 --> 21:42.400
we had a lot to say about that, right?

21:42.400 --> 21:43.400
Like it's whatever.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.400
Yeah, I know.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.400
I know.

21:45.400 --> 21:49.620
But it but it still needs to be said, like, you know, people can have their faves and

21:49.620 --> 21:50.620
all that.

21:50.620 --> 21:51.620
That's fine.

21:51.620 --> 21:57.820
But when it comes to, you know, Madden and how bad 23 appears to be, even if you're a

21:57.820 --> 22:01.820
fan, not just with these, you know, built in issues, but just with, you know, a lot

22:01.820 --> 22:05.000
of the whole like, it's the same stuff, but it sounds like things aren't implemented well

22:05.000 --> 22:11.240
that why not just continue to play Madden 22 and be like, you know what, until EA you

22:11.240 --> 22:16.560
make a game worth upgrading from, we're just going to stick with the game that works, which

22:16.560 --> 22:19.000
for all I know, is probably not even Madden 22.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.520
It's probably have to go back further, to be honest.

22:21.520 --> 22:27.040
And that goes back to something that I always say is, you know, be critical of what you

22:27.040 --> 22:28.040
love.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.040
Yeah.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.120
And we do that a lot here.

22:31.120 --> 22:38.560
Just because you're complaining about your, you know, a game, it doesn't mean that you

22:38.560 --> 22:44.560
don't love the franchise, or you know what it could be capable of, it means that you

22:44.560 --> 22:49.320
care enough to be vocal to give some real criticism about it.

22:49.320 --> 22:54.440
And I'm not just saying you go over the socks, and then you know, not expand upon that, but

22:54.440 --> 22:59.160
absolutely have something that's going to back up your reasoning for your opinion.

22:59.160 --> 23:06.520
And then the second thing about it, put action to it, nothing changes until you make it change.

23:06.520 --> 23:13.160
And look at the boy, the boycott is the right idea.

23:13.160 --> 23:17.800
And I mean, look at the amount of monetization they're doing in a $60 I'm actually I think

23:17.800 --> 23:24.320
it's 60 years at $70 now I don't even know game that really should be free to play at

23:24.320 --> 23:25.320
this point.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.320
If that's all they're doing.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.900
They're not updating the game at all each year there.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.900
It's just literally a roster update.

23:30.900 --> 23:35.480
And like I said, they've been caught even in some versions having the old assets in

23:35.480 --> 23:36.480
the game.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.220
Like, come on, you know,

23:39.220 --> 23:41.580
saving money, but don't be obvious about it.

23:41.580 --> 23:45.140
They're making billions of dollars off of this, like they're not putting any of that

23:45.140 --> 23:49.700
money back into the franchise, it would be different if they're like monetizing the crap

23:49.700 --> 23:50.700
out of it.

23:50.700 --> 23:53.200
But it's just such an amazing groundbreaking game.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.580
It's not that anymore.

23:54.580 --> 23:57.760
It's just, they're not forced to compete.

23:57.760 --> 24:02.620
And so the game doesn't innovate because they have the license, which this is partly NFL's

24:02.620 --> 24:08.460
fault as well, because they're the ones not licensing it to other companies.

24:08.460 --> 24:14.020
And so now the NFL has this crappy game that they get to put their brand on.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.140
I mean, cool.

24:15.140 --> 24:21.060
Mike Deft confirms $70 for man 23 on the PS five, and last gen versions are 60, which is

24:21.060 --> 24:22.060
kind of what we seen.

24:22.060 --> 24:27.180
I honestly, I really think, you know, but obviously EA is going to hate this idea because

24:27.180 --> 24:31.060
it's less money for them, but I really think, you know what, put the effort into making

24:31.060 --> 24:37.820
a solid, fun football game, and then you know what, pay $20 for the licensed annual updates

24:37.820 --> 24:40.300
and put out a really solid game every four years.

24:40.300 --> 24:44.020
Anyway, you're still going to make money off of all these, you know, cards and all these

24:44.020 --> 24:45.020
other things too.

24:45.020 --> 24:50.060
But like, why, why have this ruse of these major changes for 70 bucks?

24:50.060 --> 24:52.980
Why not just do 20 bucks for like an expansion pack?

24:52.980 --> 25:04.020
Why not do the dead by daylight model seriously, you know, put out a new chapter for like each,

25:04.020 --> 25:09.460
each season with the new players or have like DLC in case they've brought in like someone

25:09.460 --> 25:14.700
new mid season or something, you know, I don't know if people actually do that because it's

25:14.700 --> 25:15.700
sports ball.

25:15.700 --> 25:16.700
I don't care.

25:16.700 --> 25:24.900
But I mean, I think that doing that way saves them a lot of time on production because then

25:24.900 --> 25:30.500
they have their base game engine, hopefully perfected.

25:30.500 --> 25:31.500
It's not.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.180
It's not even close to perfect.

25:33.180 --> 25:34.540
It's buggy as hell.

25:34.540 --> 25:42.160
Let me finish that if they have, if they have an engine that works that they have perfected

25:42.160 --> 25:48.560
and put that one into implementation and then just build on that, you know, you know, eventually

25:48.560 --> 25:53.200
it is going to run to a point where they may have to update like whatever their engine

25:53.200 --> 25:59.600
is, but that hopefully won't be for some time because you know, the, the, the engine is

25:59.600 --> 26:01.480
going to be what runs the game.

26:01.480 --> 26:06.900
You're just going to change the shell on top of it and maybe like every couple of years,

26:06.900 --> 26:13.540
you know, have a, we've done this cosmetic upgrade, update your game for the, you know,

26:13.540 --> 26:22.980
for the updated fields or crowd effects or whatever, you know, and that way it's in the

26:22.980 --> 26:29.820
end going to save them money because they aren't going to have to work into, you know,

26:29.820 --> 26:36.380
on the production of a brand new game that, you know, they're going to have to make all

26:36.380 --> 26:40.540
new assets for, even though we've seen proof that they're not doing it.

26:40.540 --> 26:48.020
They can just recycle assets that are going to, you know, if they, if they still are graphically,

26:48.020 --> 26:56.100
you know, fine, then keep using the same assets, you know, maybe, maybe, you know, have upscale

26:56.100 --> 27:00.220
options or something, or, you know, every few years, like I was saying with the engine,

27:00.220 --> 27:04.740
if the engine's been updated, update the, the models as well.

27:04.740 --> 27:11.180
And that way you can, you know, they can put more dedicated time into it, less time than

27:11.180 --> 27:14.580
what they would do to crank out a new game every year.

27:14.580 --> 27:20.980
And you know, also it's kinder to their employees, it's kinder to the market, put out the base

27:20.980 --> 27:27.860
game for 20 bucks and have the updates be, you know, like do a few of them every year.

27:27.860 --> 27:36.260
Because if people pay like, say $15 for an update and they're doing it, say three times

27:36.260 --> 27:42.140
a year, that's $45 per person playing the game, right?

27:42.140 --> 27:46.300
And then you put out the DLC packets, like here's your fan packet.

27:46.300 --> 27:52.340
If you were a fan of the sea chickens or something, I called them sea chickens because Dan calls

27:52.340 --> 27:56.540
them sea chickens, the Seahawks.

27:56.540 --> 27:57.540
But do you see my point?

27:57.540 --> 28:02.500
Yeah, let me, Loki, do you want to jump in or otherwise I'm gonna get to chat comments.

28:02.500 --> 28:06.980
Oh, I was just gonna say, well, they, this is the model that they've already adapted for like,

28:06.980 --> 28:10.820
almost everything that they have, which is basically release unfinished products,

28:11.380 --> 28:16.260
and monetize the crap out of them, and only do something when there's massive backlash to it.

28:17.060 --> 28:22.100
I mean, that's, look at look at Battlefield, that that series is suffering because of the way that

28:22.100 --> 28:23.060
they treated it.

28:23.060 --> 28:26.500
Look at Mommy Madden's just been mad and it's been suffering for years.

28:26.500 --> 28:27.940
But same problem with FIFA too.

28:27.940 --> 28:32.980
Like, they're fundamentally buggy as hell, and unfinished and unpolished.

28:32.980 --> 28:37.540
And considering that they're reusing the same game over and over again, it's really weird

28:37.540 --> 28:40.660
to see the same bugs every single year in that stuff.

28:40.660 --> 28:46.900
Like, it's just, there's really no excuse at this point for this like kind of product,

28:46.900 --> 28:50.100
especially with the amount of money that they have coming in.

28:50.100 --> 28:53.860
It's not a matter of like, we don't have the funds to produce a good game.

28:53.860 --> 28:55.300
It's just they don't care.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.380
They're just giving it all to their shareholders.

28:57.380 --> 29:02.500
And so like, I just don't this is why no one trusts EA to make a good game anymore.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.980
It's just whatever it is what it is.

29:04.980 --> 29:06.660
But used to be the company.

29:08.660 --> 29:12.340
Let me go to chat and get some of the comments here over twitch.tv slash vog network.

29:12.340 --> 29:16.500
So Tiger Claw and chat asks, should Madden be games as a service rather than release

29:16.500 --> 29:17.780
new games every year?

29:17.780 --> 29:21.060
Well, in my opinion, they're trying to monetize the game like it's both already.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.140
And that's there in lies the problem.

29:23.140 --> 29:26.420
They want their they're literally want their cake and eating it too.

29:26.420 --> 29:31.460
And so I think they need to ditch the new games every year and just admit what they're

29:31.460 --> 29:33.700
trying to do, which is the games as a service.

29:33.700 --> 29:36.980
And that also tried to do games of the service member type was it member?

29:38.020 --> 29:41.620
Oh, God was there I can't even remember the game because it's been blocked out of my mind.

29:41.620 --> 29:46.020
They're stupid jetpack games as a service game that folded because it was awful.

29:46.660 --> 29:47.460
That's not sports.

29:48.100 --> 29:48.820
I'm talking matter.

29:48.820 --> 29:49.460
It's EA.

29:50.100 --> 29:53.380
Well, yeah, but I'm I'm pointing out the anthem flop for different reasons.

29:53.380 --> 29:55.220
But anyway, that's true.

29:55.220 --> 29:59.300
And Matt says, I will say in the sports game developers defense, the devs have a very short

29:59.300 --> 30:00.660
window to make each year's game.

30:00.660 --> 30:02.980
They roughly have about eight months to make a new game.

30:02.980 --> 30:05.060
First four months are spent patching updates work.

30:05.060 --> 30:05.700
That's exactly.

30:05.700 --> 30:09.140
But that's exactly what I'm that's what needs to change is that that whole.

30:09.700 --> 30:10.100
Yeah.

30:10.100 --> 30:13.460
And that's that's the same thing I've been trying to say, too, with that whole idea about,

30:13.460 --> 30:13.940
you know what?

30:13.940 --> 30:19.300
Put out a new game every three years and do an expansion pack for the rosters and maybe

30:19.300 --> 30:24.180
one or two cool new features or modes in the off years to get your money there, too, if

30:24.180 --> 30:24.740
you must.

30:24.740 --> 30:30.820
But this whole concept of seventy dollar games every year, like the reality is maybe you

30:30.820 --> 30:36.660
could poop out a game in a year in the Genesis era when these games all first started to

30:36.660 --> 30:39.780
come to, you know, a really big prominence and so forth.

30:39.780 --> 30:43.700
But this is not a possibility in the PlayStation five era anymore.

30:43.700 --> 30:46.020
Games are not developed the way they used to be.

30:46.020 --> 30:49.060
At least games of this scale are not developed the way they used to be.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.180
You know what I mean?

30:50.180 --> 30:53.860
It might have taken one or two people to make trombone champ, but that's a different, you

30:53.860 --> 30:55.380
know, a completely different type of game.

30:55.380 --> 31:00.020
Well, if they're they're hell bent on putting out a game out every single year, then what

31:00.020 --> 31:04.820
you got to do is you got to go the call of duty method where you have multiple studios

31:04.820 --> 31:07.060
working on these games and cycling through them.

31:07.060 --> 31:10.820
So their development time is like three years and you have three studios working on you

31:10.820 --> 31:12.180
making billions of dollars.

31:12.180 --> 31:13.300
You can afford it.

31:13.300 --> 31:16.420
The thing is, they don't want to put the money into it because they're going to make those

31:16.420 --> 31:19.540
billions of dollars, whether they put out a piece of crap or they put out a great piece

31:19.540 --> 31:21.540
of, you know, quality content.

31:21.540 --> 31:28.260
It's such a monetarily minimal difference in what they're going to make, you know, other

31:28.260 --> 31:29.860
than the praise or whatnot.

31:31.060 --> 31:32.980
They just don't care is what it is.

31:33.780 --> 31:37.460
Well, again, the best thing you can do is vote with your wallet.

31:37.460 --> 31:40.900
And, you know, if you don't agree with it, you've got to resist the temptation to buy

31:40.900 --> 31:43.860
the game and especially the DLC that's within the game.

31:43.940 --> 31:48.740
But the reality is, especially in the streaming culture, you know, people you feel that they

31:48.740 --> 31:51.540
need to play those latest and greatest things to get those views.

31:51.540 --> 31:55.380
And that may be true that, you know, there's lots of streamers out there.

31:55.380 --> 31:58.660
And if you're not streaming the thing somebody wants to see, they'll go somewhere else.

31:58.660 --> 32:04.100
But I think even we as people that consume streams have to if we believe strongly enough

32:04.100 --> 32:08.740
that this game sucks and shouldn't be supported, the development behind it, that we have to

32:08.740 --> 32:10.900
stop watching those types of streams.

32:10.900 --> 32:12.740
That goes for much more than just Madden.

32:12.740 --> 32:16.900
That also goes for something like Anthem, which was something that was up my alley.

32:16.900 --> 32:20.420
But the issues with that game were transparent from the very beginning.

32:21.220 --> 32:22.900
And it's really too bad.

32:23.620 --> 32:24.820
So, all right.

32:26.020 --> 32:29.940
Well, let's move on and talk about the games that we are enjoying in a segment called How

32:29.940 --> 32:30.900
Is Your Gaming Week?

32:30.900 --> 32:33.380
And so what are we supporting this week with our playtime?

32:33.380 --> 32:34.340
We'll go to Dark Soccer.

32:34.340 --> 32:35.220
How is your gaming week?

32:35.860 --> 32:37.620
My gaming week was pretty fun.

32:38.500 --> 32:41.540
I, of course, was playing Dead by Daylight.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.860
I actually played some killer matches.

32:47.460 --> 32:49.780
I had a factually I had a very funny thing happen.

32:50.580 --> 32:52.100
So I made some new friends.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.020
But let me tell you how I made my new friends.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.860
Gwen had to sign off and we normally play together.

32:59.860 --> 33:01.780
So I ended up playing killer.

33:02.340 --> 33:06.740
And, you know, as I've been wanting to do lately, I've just been sort of fucking off

33:06.820 --> 33:10.820
and letting, you know, letting survivors have a good time, you know, just trying to do my

33:10.820 --> 33:15.460
challenges and letting people out, you know, because so many other killers are big, you

33:15.460 --> 33:16.500
know, stink nuggets.

33:18.420 --> 33:22.660
And then I made friends with two of the survivors in the endgame chat.

33:22.660 --> 33:24.660
And I was like, well, hey, do you mind if I Swift with you?

33:24.660 --> 33:26.500
And they're like, yeah, come Swift with us.

33:27.060 --> 33:34.340
And so I played with them and then we made friends with the killer in the endgame chat

33:34.340 --> 33:35.300
after that.

33:35.300 --> 33:42.100
So I have started following Paisley Panda, that's Paisley with an IE, who is absolutely

33:42.100 --> 33:50.660
a delightful non-binary Dead by Daylight killer learning huntress and absolutely fun.

33:50.660 --> 33:52.900
But I've never had something like that happen.

33:52.900 --> 33:59.060
And I think that it goes back to kind of my whole theory about, you know, if you have

33:59.060 --> 34:04.420
a chance and a reason to be nice in the endgame chat, then sometimes it can work out to your

34:04.420 --> 34:05.060
advantage.

34:05.060 --> 34:09.300
You can make friends and, you know, and then if the person is a shit to you, then you just

34:09.300 --> 34:12.340
make them look bad because you're a nice person and they're not.

34:14.580 --> 34:20.180
But in this case, it was very interesting situation that happened.

34:20.180 --> 34:23.940
I made new friends to play with and found another streamer who does some absolutely

34:23.940 --> 34:25.060
delightful content.

34:25.700 --> 34:29.140
And I had a good time.

34:29.380 --> 34:36.180
Um, I'm also working on at least getting all of my survivors to prestige one.

34:36.180 --> 34:39.220
And I'm trying to talk myself into playing Wesker.

34:39.220 --> 34:44.180
It's just, I don't feel right playing Wesker right now with all of the fucking Weskers

34:44.180 --> 34:46.420
that are every fucking where in the game.

34:46.420 --> 34:47.300
I won't play him either.

34:48.340 --> 34:50.340
Yeah, I can wait on my adapt.

34:50.340 --> 34:52.420
I'm not, I'm not hyper about it.

34:53.060 --> 35:00.580
Um, but, um, I've also of course been playing cult of the lamb, which is a very delightful

35:00.580 --> 35:01.220
game.

35:01.220 --> 35:02.020
Funny enough.

35:02.020 --> 35:02.420
Okay.

35:02.420 --> 35:07.140
So I didn't stream final fantasy for last night like I normally do because we looked

35:07.140 --> 35:14.340
into tickets to see where now and we, um, we missed the chance to get the tickets in

35:14.340 --> 35:17.460
the first place because we had already been to the tour.

35:17.460 --> 35:22.340
It's the one where he does all of his original, like the style parodies and not the actual

35:22.340 --> 35:23.300
parody parodies.

35:24.100 --> 35:28.820
Um, but when we went to the first one, it was all unplugged and this one wasn't, it

35:28.820 --> 35:31.140
was, you know, full on guitars and everything.

35:31.140 --> 35:31.860
It was really fun.

35:32.580 --> 35:39.780
Um, but, uh, we sat with, uh, a couple of guys and one of them had a Triforce tattoo

35:39.780 --> 35:41.460
when we just started talking about games.

35:42.180 --> 35:48.580
Um, and, uh, he's like, so there's this game called cult of the land.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.540
I'm like, oh yeah, I streamed that thing on Mondays and he's like, awesome.

35:52.260 --> 35:55.460
And then I, you know, we, we just chatted for a little bit.

35:55.460 --> 35:56.260
Where was the show?

35:56.260 --> 35:57.540
Is that here in SAC?

35:57.540 --> 35:59.940
It was at the Mondavi center in Davis.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.220
Oh, okay.

36:01.220 --> 36:01.540
Okay.

36:01.540 --> 36:02.500
I haven't been there in a long time.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.940
I think I saw Margaret show there once.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.500
You and I saw Margaret show there.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.100
I think that was like the only time I've ever been there.

36:08.100 --> 36:08.820
Okay, cool.

36:08.820 --> 36:13.300
That was, I think the last time I went there and they've really built up around that.

36:13.300 --> 36:18.980
Um, and no, uh, I haven't seen the weird Al biopic yet.

36:18.980 --> 36:20.820
Um, but he did talk about it.

36:20.820 --> 36:23.380
Um, and I'm looking forward to seeing it.

36:23.380 --> 36:26.260
Of course I've seen UHF 50,000 times.

36:26.260 --> 36:27.620
I got engaged to that movie.

36:30.660 --> 36:33.300
But, um, I don't think the bio picks out yet.

36:33.300 --> 36:34.260
Cause I definitely want to see that.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.060
It's November.

36:35.700 --> 36:36.180
Yeah.

36:36.180 --> 36:37.620
And actually Bobby just said that.

36:38.500 --> 36:44.100
Um, but, uh, but I'm really, I'm, I'm looking forward to that.

36:44.100 --> 36:46.580
And of course to getting my, my pinball table.

36:47.140 --> 36:54.420
Um, I played doctor who pinball today and actually had a very decent third ball.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.540
Um, that game likes to drain like a bitch.

36:57.540 --> 37:02.100
Um, but I, I had multi ball happen a couple of times.

37:02.100 --> 37:08.740
Um, and I keep forgetting just how much the Dalek voice in that one, because the speakers

37:08.740 --> 37:11.700
aren't the best, uh, makes my head hurt.

37:11.700 --> 37:13.380
Of course I already had a headache.

37:14.020 --> 37:19.060
Um, but yeah, and of course tonight I'm going to be playing dead by daylight later.

37:19.060 --> 37:25.460
If anyone wants to play with me and Gwen, um, I've also been really hooked on my word

37:25.460 --> 37:28.820
scapes, like unbelievably hooked on my word scapes.

37:29.540 --> 37:36.340
Um, especially now that they seem to have had new, um, new puzzles released.

37:36.340 --> 37:38.980
Cause I'm finally starting to see different words.

37:39.620 --> 37:47.380
Um, I like that one of the words now is Eureka and that, uh, it still doesn't like for me

37:47.380 --> 37:49.220
to, to play body parts.

37:49.940 --> 37:52.820
Although it does recognize that orgy is a word.

37:52.820 --> 37:54.740
It will not recognize butt sex.

37:56.180 --> 38:00.420
Cause remember you can't spell subtext without butt sex.

38:01.940 --> 38:02.580
It's true.

38:02.580 --> 38:03.620
Useful life advice.

38:03.620 --> 38:04.180
Thank you.

38:04.180 --> 38:04.740
Useful.

38:04.740 --> 38:05.780
I learned the hard way.

38:05.780 --> 38:07.220
It's the, it's the same letters.

38:08.100 --> 38:15.700
Um, but, um, I'm also trying to, I, I've, I'm about ready to finish final fantasy four.

38:15.700 --> 38:19.700
So I'm trying to decide if I want to do five or move on to star ocean.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.500
So I'm probably putting a pull up.

38:22.500 --> 38:26.020
I'm personally leaning toward five just cause I haven't played the game in an age.

38:27.060 --> 38:27.460
Yeah.

38:27.460 --> 38:29.540
And I've never played star ocean.

38:29.540 --> 38:35.780
So five is, um, a little weirder because you know, those of us in the U S well, it's just

38:35.780 --> 38:39.140
that like those of us in the U S don't have those high school memories or whatever you

38:39.140 --> 38:43.620
want to call it a five because we never got to play five until when, when did they finally

38:43.620 --> 38:44.580
officially release it here?

38:44.580 --> 38:46.180
Was it in the PS one classic Sarah?

38:46.180 --> 38:49.540
When they finally let us play that game or was it even later than that?

38:49.540 --> 38:50.260
Yes.

38:50.260 --> 38:53.780
So I had played translated copies of it before.

38:55.220 --> 38:56.020
Um, oh yeah.

38:56.020 --> 38:57.140
I remember the translator ROM.

38:57.140 --> 39:00.660
That's how I played it in college, but even the translator ROM had its issues, you know,

39:00.660 --> 39:02.020
it was still, it was still weird.

39:02.020 --> 39:02.580
Yeah.

39:02.580 --> 39:04.100
But all right.

39:04.100 --> 39:04.500
Oh yeah.

39:04.500 --> 39:04.820
Yeah.

39:04.820 --> 39:05.940
It's character's name was butts.

39:06.820 --> 39:07.460
Yeah.

39:07.460 --> 39:15.300
I always, my, I always translated it as like Batsu as in like, you know, the same spelling

39:15.300 --> 39:20.580
as Batsu from, uh, uh, project justice or, uh, she did to justice.

39:20.580 --> 39:21.620
Kuckling.

39:21.620 --> 39:28.260
Um, so, but there's other people who do it like as Bart's or something.

39:28.260 --> 39:29.380
I just say Batsu.

39:29.380 --> 39:30.020
Yeah.

39:30.020 --> 39:35.220
Um, but I, I don't remember a whole lot of it, even though I've beaten it.

39:35.220 --> 39:38.660
So I'm looking forward to re-familiarizing myself with that.

39:39.300 --> 39:42.500
Um, and again, I haven't played star ocean.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.180
I also have Emerald dragon.

39:45.060 --> 39:50.900
Um, but I'm trying to decide when I play that, if I'm going to do the turbo graphics version,

39:50.900 --> 39:53.940
cause I do own the turbo graphics version.

39:54.900 --> 40:02.180
Um, like a legit Japanese one, or if I'm going to play the, the super Famicom one.

40:02.180 --> 40:08.420
Um, and, and, and, and also I picked up, uh, a game and I don't think he can hear me, but

40:08.420 --> 40:14.900
I picked up, um, uh, Kunio, uh, dodge ball as in super dodge ball.

40:16.020 --> 40:17.460
Oh, super Famicom.

40:17.460 --> 40:17.960
Great.

40:18.600 --> 40:25.480
So I'm, I'm hoping that, uh, spouse gets a kick out of it, even though we've got it on

40:25.480 --> 40:26.120
the upper drive.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.360
All right.

40:28.360 --> 40:29.560
Oh, oh, one last thing.

40:29.560 --> 40:30.060
Yeah.

40:30.600 --> 40:36.920
On teepublic, I found Vib ribbon t-shirts and stickers, and I have a Vib ribbon sticker

40:36.920 --> 40:43.160
now that when, uh, you're doing your gaming week, I will try to find my picture album

40:43.160 --> 40:43.960
and show.

40:43.960 --> 40:46.120
There is a dangerous sale on that site yesterday.

40:46.120 --> 40:49.720
Cause, uh, it's always on, there's always dangerous sales on there.

40:49.720 --> 40:50.280
I know, right?

40:50.280 --> 40:51.240
That's why I got this shirt.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.360
I absolutely want a Vib ribbon shirt.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.320
It's so cute.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.360
And I love Vibri.

40:56.360 --> 41:01.000
In fact, to the point that I've actually been trying, I've been considering finding a copy

41:01.000 --> 41:03.240
of Moji ribbon, even though it's very text heavy.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.960
What is your, what is your shirt?

41:05.960 --> 41:06.280
Loki?

41:06.280 --> 41:07.880
Cause the microphone kind of blocks it for us.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.000
So I can't really see what's on it.

41:09.000 --> 41:09.560
It's a met.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.760
Oh, if you can see it.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.200
Oh, okay.

41:14.200 --> 41:14.600
Yeah.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.760
It's it's hard to see, but yeah.

41:16.760 --> 41:17.000
Okay.

41:17.880 --> 41:19.640
Oh, and one more thing.

41:19.640 --> 41:19.880
Yeah.

41:19.880 --> 41:20.760
I might've said it.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.520
I ordered a reverse bear trap today.

41:23.080 --> 41:23.240
Yeah.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.120
You mentioned that in the beginning.

41:24.120 --> 41:24.600
That's all right.

41:24.600 --> 41:24.920
Yeah.

41:24.920 --> 41:25.560
All right.

41:25.560 --> 41:28.120
Let's uh, go to Loki and talk about your gaming week.

41:28.120 --> 41:28.760
How was your game?

41:28.760 --> 41:33.560
So, uh, I played mostly Minecraft this week as usual.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.760
I know it's shocking.

41:34.760 --> 41:39.560
It's I've been working on that massive project still, which I just about done with.

41:39.560 --> 41:47.000
I have the main, the main, uh, body done and I'm finishing up with the last bits of the arms and

41:47.000 --> 41:47.800
stuff.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.960
So that'll be coming this week in a video.

41:50.680 --> 41:55.480
I wanted to have it out this weekend, but it's just, it was too massive to be able to finish

41:55.480 --> 41:55.960
this week.

41:55.960 --> 41:59.160
And I tried lots of hours, like 80 some hours in there.

41:59.800 --> 42:08.600
Um, uh, I also played, uh, was it, uh, trombone, uh, champion.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.360
I think that's what it's called now.

42:10.360 --> 42:10.760
Trombone.

42:11.640 --> 42:11.880
Yeah.

42:11.880 --> 42:12.600
Trombone champ.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.680
Very fun game.

42:14.680 --> 42:15.640
Very strange game.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.080
Hard for me to play that.

42:19.080 --> 42:22.920
I don't know, like with the mouse stuff, like, I feel like it's hard to like, kind of move

42:22.920 --> 42:23.240
fast.

42:23.240 --> 42:27.560
If I think I need to adjust some of the settings in there, I've definitely took off the, um,

42:27.560 --> 42:28.520
inverter controls.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.240
Cause that was annoying.

42:29.800 --> 42:32.040
But, um, yeah, it's a funny game.

42:32.040 --> 42:37.240
I like the, the mix between like, it's like, we music almost like the presentation of it

42:37.240 --> 42:43.960
with like baboons and like, what else?

42:43.960 --> 42:51.640
Like they also have like, uh, like, um, all sorts of like weird, uh, sirens and stuff

42:51.640 --> 42:52.600
going off in it.

42:52.600 --> 42:58.120
And, um, it's just a really weird mashup of things, but it's funny.

42:58.120 --> 42:59.080
It's worth checking out.

42:59.720 --> 43:00.120
All right.

43:00.120 --> 43:04.600
Um, so yeah, I wanted to get to monkey Island this week, but I didn't get to that, but hopefully

43:04.600 --> 43:05.000
you soon.

43:05.640 --> 43:06.140
All right.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.280
Uh, my gaming week.

43:08.280 --> 43:12.360
So you might notice if you're watching live on Twitch, I have these giant headphones cause

43:12.360 --> 43:13.240
they're new.

43:13.240 --> 43:16.840
I bought new headphones this week cause my other ones finally died, which was sad and

43:16.840 --> 43:20.600
it was getting very annoying, but it's been nice to actually be able to hear games again.

43:20.600 --> 43:25.960
The, um, the audio is really, it's a, it's a razor crack and, uh, I think this is the

43:25.960 --> 43:27.640
V3, so it was on sale.

43:27.640 --> 43:31.080
So, um, yeah, it does the, it does the chroma lights in it, although they're very hard to

43:31.080 --> 43:32.360
see on the stream right now.

43:32.360 --> 43:36.600
Um, but yeah, so like when I play Diablo three, they turn red and all that silly stuff.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.440
So yeah, it's fun.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.200
It's, it's, it's silly, but it's fun.

43:40.200 --> 43:45.880
But, um, as far as games that I've been enjoying using it, uh, a lot of the same old stuff,

43:45.880 --> 43:48.200
you know, I've also been playing dead by daylight.

43:48.200 --> 43:51.400
I'm getting really close to finishing this tome, which I never do.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.360
I never do.

43:52.360 --> 43:55.560
So that is, uh, that is quite an accomplishment in itself.

43:55.560 --> 43:59.560
Uh, mostly really good cosmetics, by the way, in the rift.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.440
Did you get them?

44:00.440 --> 44:03.560
Uh, no, I'm, uh, when I say finish, I mean, get through the fourth page.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.320
I never even get that far.

44:05.320 --> 44:06.920
So, but I'm only like two challenges away.

44:06.920 --> 44:09.320
So I'm going to stream tomorrow to try to finish.

44:09.320 --> 44:10.360
Cause I'm really close.

44:10.360 --> 44:13.400
I got, I made really good progress on the gen generator.

44:13.400 --> 44:13.720
Okay.

44:13.720 --> 44:15.240
I should, I should be around after work.

44:15.240 --> 44:19.560
I just not sure the specifics for the holiday and that should be after services.

44:19.560 --> 44:19.880
Nice.

44:19.880 --> 44:20.120
Okay.

44:20.120 --> 44:21.720
Yeah, it should be about four 30.

44:21.720 --> 44:26.440
Um, so, um, I'll, I'll be playing a little bit of that, trying to finish that.

44:26.440 --> 44:29.560
And, um, I did a little killer as well.

44:29.560 --> 44:34.040
So, um, uh, I played that all on stream, my own stream on Friday.

44:34.680 --> 44:37.160
Um, I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14.

44:37.160 --> 44:42.280
Uh, I finished the Island, which I think I may have done last week, uh, got my Island

44:42.280 --> 44:43.160
to rank 10.

44:43.160 --> 44:49.320
But this week I actually built every building the farthest it could go.

44:49.320 --> 44:54.520
Um, so I've built all my granaries to level three, all the workshops to level three.

44:54.520 --> 44:57.320
So like literally everything is maxed out.

44:57.320 --> 45:03.720
And then I found out there is another special artifact that you can make, but it is, it's

45:03.720 --> 45:05.720
a really hard crafting project.

45:05.720 --> 45:12.200
So I can either buy the mats for 3 million Gil, which I'm thinking about doing, or I

45:12.200 --> 45:14.600
can just invest in my crafters and try to make this.

45:14.600 --> 45:17.080
So it's, it's called a water otter fountain.

45:17.080 --> 45:19.080
So I'm trying to make that for my Island.

45:19.080 --> 45:23.480
I'm telling you, some people raid, some people glamour.

45:23.480 --> 45:28.040
I am all in on that stupid Island life thing.

45:28.040 --> 45:28.920
It's great.

45:28.920 --> 45:31.240
And I'm so excited for them to make enhancements to it later.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.920
Sounds like animal crossing.

45:32.920 --> 45:38.040
I would say it's, it's definitely influenced by that, but it's, um, more the, um, you

45:38.120 --> 45:43.320
know, the farming SIM games, uh, that are a plenty in Japanese culture that we see over.

45:43.320 --> 45:43.640
Yeah.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.920
All of it, all of it.

45:44.920 --> 45:50.200
So it's, you know, it's, it's not as in depth, but it's definitely inspired by that stuff.

45:50.200 --> 45:57.000
So, uh, let's see, uh, pod culture says you didn't go for the kitty ear version talking

45:57.000 --> 46:00.440
about my headphones to which tape plays games calls me a fake streamer.

46:00.440 --> 46:09.240
Uh, no, I did the, these generic, uh, you know, bland, uh, heterosexual black ones were

46:09.240 --> 46:10.040
on sale.

46:10.040 --> 46:14.760
So I just bought the, cause price always is going to win over functions.

46:14.760 --> 46:17.240
So there is that.

46:18.120 --> 46:20.040
Um, let's see.

46:20.040 --> 46:22.440
So, uh, what else have I played during my gaming week?

46:22.440 --> 46:25.640
Um, I played Assassin's Creed Odyssey a little more than on Wednesday.

46:25.640 --> 46:28.280
I'm still liking that game more than I thought I would.

46:28.360 --> 46:33.720
Um, don't love the boat fights though, because once you get like a full big boat, then you

46:33.720 --> 46:37.800
get into these things where you get into like Archer fights with other boats and these big

46:37.800 --> 46:39.560
boat, I didn't like that part.

46:39.560 --> 46:41.080
It was really clunky to me.

46:41.080 --> 46:43.640
I don't like trying to drive the boat around and all that stuff.

46:43.640 --> 46:49.080
And that part's not fun, but that's otherwise just a blemish on what I'm, I'm still enjoying

46:49.080 --> 46:50.040
as a game.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.640
Um, that was a pretty fun.

46:52.200 --> 46:52.600
Okay.

46:52.600 --> 46:55.160
So Rob, you've talked about most of those games and playing before.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.320
Did you play anything new this week?

46:57.320 --> 46:58.120
Yes, I did.

46:58.120 --> 46:59.800
I did play one new game this week.

46:59.800 --> 47:04.360
And so we actually have a story coming up later in the show about this series of games.

47:04.360 --> 47:07.160
And I decided to jump in and buy one of them.

47:07.160 --> 47:10.360
So it's the Atari recharged games.

47:10.360 --> 47:14.920
So that is exactly the reaction I had.

47:14.920 --> 47:17.960
Is that the collection or is that like just the remade game?

47:17.960 --> 47:18.600
Okay.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.200
They are working on a collection.

47:20.200 --> 47:22.120
There's that there's like a 50 collection.

47:22.120 --> 47:27.080
There's the mini game thing, the WarioWare thing, but with Atari that is coming out in

47:27.080 --> 47:27.800
October.

47:27.800 --> 47:33.480
But I didn't even realize these recharge things, which they've done for Centipede, Breakout,

47:33.480 --> 47:35.640
Gravatar, Asteroids.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.560
Like there's quite a few of them, right?

47:37.560 --> 47:44.120
They've they're out and they've been now I think they were out on Atari VCS first, but

47:44.120 --> 47:46.840
of course, how many people actually bought into that?

47:46.840 --> 47:49.640
And I think Atari start to realize that too.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.640
So they've been doing these releases on Steam.

47:51.640 --> 47:58.360
So the one that I picked up was Yars Revenge Recharge because I love that 2600 game.

47:58.360 --> 48:01.640
I don't know how many of you remember that from back in the day, but here's a little

48:01.640 --> 48:04.280
peek at what it looks like for those that are watching on Twitch.

48:04.280 --> 48:09.640
So you can see it has a lot of the similar mechanic from the first game where you try

48:09.640 --> 48:13.480
to go in, you're trying to either shoot the shields or you can eat the shields.

48:13.480 --> 48:18.760
And then you're charging that giant photon laser that you then try to blast the main

48:18.760 --> 48:19.320
cannon with.

48:19.320 --> 48:23.080
If you've ever played the original Yars Revenge, that will make a little more sense

48:23.080 --> 48:24.360
than if you've never played the game.

48:24.360 --> 48:29.240
Then it just sounds like I'm kind of just speaking of another language, which, you know,

48:29.240 --> 48:29.960
I get it.

48:29.960 --> 48:35.560
But of course, the thing about this game is because it's recharged, it's very pretty,

48:35.560 --> 48:39.160
bright, has that kind of geometry wars.

48:39.160 --> 48:43.160
And literally it's a twin stick shooter now because, you know, the Atari 2600 only had

48:43.160 --> 48:44.760
what the joystick and the one button now.

48:44.760 --> 48:47.320
But of course, they changed it into a twin stick shooter.

48:47.320 --> 48:50.840
But of course, the levels become a lot more elaborate.

48:50.840 --> 48:55.160
So for example, on Twitch, we're watching a stage where you have the main cannon in

48:55.160 --> 49:00.600
the center, but then you have six sub cannons around the main cannon and the main cannon

49:00.600 --> 49:04.600
powers one of the sub cannons at a time to do a different type of move.

49:04.600 --> 49:08.920
So it adds a little bit of chaos into the generic formula or into the regular formula

49:08.920 --> 49:12.520
from the old game, which, you know, might have felt a little generic because it was

49:12.520 --> 49:13.720
on the Atari 2600.

49:14.120 --> 49:18.440
Um, is this game like a revolutionary twin stick shooter?

49:18.440 --> 49:19.160
Nah.

49:19.160 --> 49:21.960
But does it do the nostalgia factor pretty well?

49:21.960 --> 49:22.520
Yeah.

49:22.520 --> 49:24.440
Like I was pleasantly surprised.

49:24.440 --> 49:28.200
I kind of like this a lot more than I thought I would.

49:28.200 --> 49:30.280
So there's that.

49:30.280 --> 49:33.800
So that was another game I played this week was Yars revenge recharge.

49:33.800 --> 49:37.400
And now I'm a little curious to check out maybe some of those other Atari recharge games

49:37.400 --> 49:37.800
as well.

49:38.680 --> 49:40.840
I'm not sure they're all fantastic.

49:40.840 --> 49:46.120
And I think you have to remember they are more inspired versions when, you know, keep

49:46.120 --> 49:51.160
in mind Atari 2600 games fit into 4,000 kilobyte cartridges.

49:51.160 --> 49:54.200
Most of them, that's 4,000 characters.

49:54.200 --> 49:54.840
Okay.

49:54.840 --> 49:57.000
That's a lot to squeeze into a cartridge.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
And so the game loops in these game games were very simple.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.960
And so these recharge games are just kind of enhancing that game loop with some graphics

50:05.960 --> 50:09.720
and some other little, but they're not going to totally reinvent the game because remember

50:09.720 --> 50:13.160
there was like a Yars revenge sequel they did on like Xbox 360.

50:13.160 --> 50:17.480
And it wasn't, it wasn't that good because it just completely deviated.

50:17.480 --> 50:21.000
It's like they just took a new type of shooter game and put the Yars revenge name on it.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.520
So yeah.

50:22.520 --> 50:23.960
Tiger call is actually talking about it.

50:23.960 --> 50:27.640
I remember when they tried to reboot this game as a rail shooter, it was a name only

50:27.640 --> 50:30.440
good thing they made what looks like a true remake of the original.

50:30.440 --> 50:34.760
I'm not sure I would call it a remake of the original, but yes, I otherwise get where you're

50:34.840 --> 50:40.520
going with that comment is that it, it, it retains the spirit of the original much better

50:40.520 --> 50:44.840
than a rail shooter, which, you know, was just any old other rail shooter did.

50:44.840 --> 50:45.080
So.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.280
Dark Tetsuya in chat says I played asteroid and centipede recharge.

50:50.280 --> 50:53.720
They're fun, but I think my one complaint was that it's a one life and you're done

50:53.720 --> 50:54.840
game instead of three.

50:55.560 --> 50:59.320
But again, that kind of goes back to some of the old game loops.

50:59.320 --> 51:02.680
Although I think, you know, even asteroids in the arcade and centipede, you did have

51:02.680 --> 51:03.480
three lives.

51:03.480 --> 51:09.160
So I think in this one and yours, you have three health States.

51:09.160 --> 51:12.440
So that might be the type of thing they're doing instead is that instead of three lives,

51:12.440 --> 51:13.800
you get three health States.

51:13.800 --> 51:17.000
So I, but I haven't played those other ones yet, but I'll probably pick them up.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.680
I enjoyed yards, revenge recharged enough to go.

51:20.680 --> 51:20.920
Okay.

51:20.920 --> 51:22.280
Cause it was only 10 bucks.

51:22.280 --> 51:25.320
And I think missile command recharge is like three bucks right now.

51:25.320 --> 51:29.880
So, you know, they're not trying to charge 60, 70 bucks for them, which is good.

51:29.880 --> 51:31.240
Cause that, that would be laughable.

51:31.240 --> 51:32.120
It would never get that.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.240
They'd never get that.

51:33.240 --> 51:36.280
So 10 bucks, that's a lot more reasonable.

51:36.280 --> 51:37.320
So yeah.

51:38.360 --> 51:38.680
All right.

51:39.560 --> 51:41.320
We're going to get into some more gaming news.

51:41.960 --> 51:43.560
First though, I just want to remind everybody.

51:43.560 --> 51:46.680
We will be here live next week on October 2nd.

51:46.680 --> 51:50.680
We will not be live on October 9th as mentioned plenty during the show.

51:50.680 --> 51:54.520
Otherwise dark soccer and I both are going to be in San Diego at Twitch con.

51:54.520 --> 51:56.680
We will not be back in time for the show.

51:56.680 --> 51:58.040
I don't fly back till Monday.

51:58.040 --> 52:00.840
And you heard dark soccer earlier say she's doing Disneyland on Monday.

52:00.840 --> 52:02.680
So we won't be back in time for the show.

52:02.760 --> 52:05.160
So it'll be Bobby will be here that night though.

52:05.160 --> 52:08.920
So you can certainly tune in to VOG network and check out Bobby black Wolf.

52:08.920 --> 52:10.360
Maybe he'll run long.

52:10.360 --> 52:12.680
Maybe he can call you next week or in two weeks.

52:12.680 --> 52:13.560
Loki.

52:13.560 --> 52:14.040
I don't know.

52:14.040 --> 52:14.680
Or Loki.

52:14.680 --> 52:18.680
I don't know if you're planning on doing a stream or anything, but just take a night

52:18.680 --> 52:18.920
off.

52:18.920 --> 52:19.560
You earned it.

52:19.560 --> 52:20.680
It's hard to say.

52:20.680 --> 52:22.040
Hard to say you didn't earn it.

52:22.040 --> 52:23.720
So there's no time to take time.

52:23.720 --> 52:25.160
I have to keep making stuff.

52:25.160 --> 52:26.760
So you have to keep mining and crafting.

52:27.720 --> 52:28.040
All right.

52:28.040 --> 52:37.560
Let's tell you how many, how many, how many materials are 300,000 blocks, 185 shulker

52:37.560 --> 52:38.920
boxes worth of materials.

52:41.400 --> 52:44.200
I was gonna say, I thought your last build was something like 200,000 blocks.

52:44.200 --> 52:46.200
You said this one is 300,000.

52:46.200 --> 52:46.760
Yeah.

52:46.760 --> 52:47.260
Yeah.

52:48.040 --> 52:48.520
All right.

52:49.160 --> 52:51.560
Well, we'll, we'll keep an eye out for the YouTube.

52:51.560 --> 52:53.960
All right, let's move on.

52:53.960 --> 52:58.920
Let's get into tonight's first story, which has to official first story, which has to

52:58.920 --> 53:02.920
do with some other ongoing Twitch issues of which there were several this week.

53:02.920 --> 53:04.440
So there was a lot.

53:04.440 --> 53:06.360
Start us off with the first couple Loki.

53:07.240 --> 53:09.480
Twitch has had a week.

53:10.120 --> 53:19.960
So starting things off, there was a live stream by a streamer known as a slicker who basically

53:19.960 --> 53:27.400
admitted to after being called out about it to stealing, or I should say, scamming people

53:27.400 --> 53:33.720
out of $200,000 to fund his gambling addiction.

53:35.320 --> 53:41.000
So he was, I guess he was betting on CSGO stuff.

53:42.840 --> 53:44.840
I'm not really sure if that was the case.

53:44.840 --> 53:49.000
I thought it was sports betting is what I thought it was, but may have been CSGO.

53:49.000 --> 53:49.640
Who knows?

53:49.640 --> 53:50.280
It doesn't matter.

53:50.280 --> 53:56.360
So he, he came out and basically he was going and asking people like making up stories like,

53:56.360 --> 53:58.360
Oh yeah, my funds are frozen.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.280
He would go ask his streamer friends.

54:00.280 --> 54:04.600
He would ask his viewers, just ridiculous stuff.

54:04.600 --> 54:06.200
And then finally admitted to it.

54:06.920 --> 54:11.320
Tape, thankfully, just tape play games in our chat is clarifying.

54:11.320 --> 54:14.200
CSGO is what first ignited it, but it was sports betting.

54:14.760 --> 54:16.280
Yeah, I thought it was sports betting.

54:16.280 --> 54:18.120
And I think it was more than 200,002.

54:18.120 --> 54:23.400
I think it ended up being like 350,000, but it was a lot of money they scammed out of

54:23.400 --> 54:24.120
different people.

54:24.120 --> 54:27.480
So there was that, that kind of kicked everything off.

54:27.480 --> 54:32.680
So then when people started hearing about it, of course, reacting to it and stuff, there

54:32.680 --> 54:42.760
was this movement by Pokimane, Mizkif, and I think others as well that had been Devin

54:42.760 --> 54:48.520
Nash, I guess, who had been threatening to boycott Twitch for a week during Christmas

54:48.520 --> 54:57.240
to perform or to protest their kind of supporting these gambling streams, lax policies on them.

54:58.360 --> 55:01.400
So they made this like they were talking about and stuff like that.

55:01.400 --> 55:07.400
So then fast forward to shortly thereafter where Twitch comes out.

55:07.400 --> 55:09.400
Just jump in before you get to the Twitch thing.

55:09.960 --> 55:13.000
I have to say it because I know there's plenty of you that are thinking it and there's a

55:13.000 --> 55:14.200
lot of people that are saying this.

55:14.200 --> 55:16.840
In fact, there's Bobby Black Wolf into chat saying this, too.

55:17.400 --> 55:18.120
It's amazing.

55:18.120 --> 55:21.640
And Bobby says it's amazing how these top tier streamers know they can throw their weight

55:21.640 --> 55:24.280
around like this, but they were silent during the hate raids.

55:24.280 --> 55:26.040
Actually, not all of them were silent.

55:26.040 --> 55:30.360
I believe some of them were on record because when you do YouTube, you do these streamings,

55:30.360 --> 55:31.400
you have these clips out there.

55:31.400 --> 55:36.200
Some of them were on record saying, and I quote, what was the hashtag they were using

55:36.200 --> 55:37.960
for the Twitch day off for that?

55:37.960 --> 55:40.120
A day without Twitch, I think was what they were calling it.

55:40.120 --> 55:41.320
I'm sorry if I'm messing the name up.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.640
It was a few months ago, and I don't recall.

55:43.640 --> 55:48.600
But with some of these streamers, the same people, some of them were on the record saying

55:48.600 --> 55:50.840
a day off Twitch will never work.

55:52.280 --> 55:57.480
And yet with this now they're going and they're saying this is what we need to do.

55:57.480 --> 56:01.480
So it definitely looks not good now.

56:01.480 --> 56:05.080
You know, I think Pokimane are one of them, and I'm sorry if I'm misattributing.

56:05.080 --> 56:07.480
I don't have look, I'm a grown ass man.

56:07.560 --> 56:11.240
I don't have enough time to follow a lot of this Twitch drama and who said what and he

56:11.240 --> 56:13.000
said she said and all this crap.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.640
So I can really only look at the bottom line sometimes.

56:15.640 --> 56:20.920
But one of them went on record and said like, well, I've learned a lot since then.

56:20.920 --> 56:23.400
And you know, I was trying to be quiet.

56:23.400 --> 56:28.040
I was trying to do things behind the scenes last time and make change happen.

56:28.040 --> 56:30.680
But I've learned since then that you have to get loud.

56:30.680 --> 56:37.320
OK, so I will smile, acknowledge politely one clap.

56:37.320 --> 56:43.160
Your evolution that you've come full circle and you realized, but you have to understand

56:43.160 --> 56:50.760
it is incredibly frustrating for many people when you were supposed to have their backs

56:50.760 --> 56:57.240
during this hate raid crisis that you as a big streamer came off as not caring because

56:57.240 --> 56:58.920
it's not something that affects you.

56:58.920 --> 57:03.240
Or can't you just put your stream into follow only mode or any of this stuff?

57:03.240 --> 57:10.280
Because unfortunately, a lot of these big streamers have not had to deal with being

57:10.280 --> 57:16.520
called a slur, whether racial, sexual, other type of minorities.

57:16.520 --> 57:20.360
I mean, look at the most popular streamers.

57:20.360 --> 57:25.000
Most of them have never had to deal with being called a slur before.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.960
So they clearly don't understand the psychological toll that it takes on a lot of people and

57:30.040 --> 57:33.960
that it's much more than just clicking a button to make it all stop and go away.

57:33.960 --> 57:40.760
So I that part has to be said because there's there's a lot of voices out there, especially

57:40.760 --> 57:45.480
folks, you know, people of color and other minorities out there that are saying like,

57:45.480 --> 57:47.400
where were y'all when it was the hate raids?

57:47.960 --> 57:53.480
And it does need to be said like, again, I can applaud evolution.

57:53.480 --> 57:59.640
And OK, we do need if you got to educate people and if people are showing they're educated,

57:59.640 --> 58:00.200
then OK.

58:01.400 --> 58:07.400
But it also seems like and I got to be honest, I'm not trying to poopoo gambling addiction.

58:07.400 --> 58:08.600
It's a serious issue.

58:08.600 --> 58:10.600
It's a serious thing and so forth.

58:10.600 --> 58:17.000
But it's it's also kind of like one guy's issue that really blew up.

58:17.000 --> 58:23.160
And I understand that there's also much more gambling stuff that's on Twitch, especially

58:23.160 --> 58:26.520
when we get into the CD crypto sites and that type of stuff.

58:26.520 --> 58:32.200
And I completely understand that Twitch at the end of the day is ultimately responsible

58:32.200 --> 58:33.800
for what's on its shelf.

58:33.800 --> 58:34.120
Right.

58:34.120 --> 58:38.200
A store, if they don't want to carry something on the shelf, they don't have to carry that

58:38.200 --> 58:39.720
particular item on the shelf.

58:39.720 --> 58:45.160
Yeah, I'm just surprised that this is what they decided to address.

58:45.160 --> 58:51.480
That's that's the weird thing that it took this for you to decide crypto gambling was

58:51.480 --> 58:55.000
something that maybe should be addressed or I don't know.

58:55.000 --> 59:00.040
They're trying to I get the sense they're kind of trying to say now that, well, we were

59:00.040 --> 59:04.440
going to do this the whole time and now we're going to unveil our policy today because of

59:04.440 --> 59:06.440
all this chatter that's been going on.

59:06.440 --> 59:09.320
It just the timing is a little.

59:10.600 --> 59:10.840
Yeah.

59:10.840 --> 59:12.440
Tay says, I'm surprised you're surprised.

59:12.440 --> 59:12.680
Yeah.

59:12.680 --> 59:13.080
Yeah, sure.

59:13.080 --> 59:14.200
Nothing should be shocking anymore.

59:14.200 --> 59:15.080
Yeah, I get it.

59:15.080 --> 59:17.640
It's just it's just the timing.

59:18.920 --> 59:20.440
Sus, right?

59:20.440 --> 59:21.080
That whole thing.

59:21.640 --> 59:27.240
So because they're they're supposed to be making the ads so that they made it.

59:27.240 --> 59:34.280
Twitch came out later on, said, Yeah, we're basically going to crack down on some things.

59:34.280 --> 59:38.920
So they're going to be making a policy update on the 18th, which is really random.

59:38.920 --> 59:43.560
That's on Tuesday to prohibit streaming of gambling sites that include slots, roulette

59:43.560 --> 59:47.960
dice games that aren't licensed in the US or other jurisdictions that provide sufficient

59:47.960 --> 59:49.400
consumer protection.

59:49.480 --> 59:56.440
These sites will include stake.com, rollbit.com, dual bits and roulette.com.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.400
However, they may identify others as they move forward.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:04.440
Sports betting, fantasy sports and poker are still going to be continuing to be allowed

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.080
on the site.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:10.280
I do want to make I just want to make sure I'm very clear on something, too, because

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.480
I'll get corrected on it.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.560
Regardless, I a couple things here.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:22.360
So a lot of this has to do with these crypto gambling sites and things that are a lot more

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.160
shady.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:29.800
And what's really shady about it was that they were paying big name streamers, basically

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:37.160
giving them free money on the house money, lots of big money to make big bets on these

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.800
sites that for all I know now, I don't I don't know how to always find the scenes, but for

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.040
all I know, could have been rigged to ensure that because, you know, you can tell a slot

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.640
machine what the payout should be.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:52.040
So it could it could easily be rigged for a certain user to make sure that they are

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:58.360
actually going to win on that money to entice other people to come into that site and spend

01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.080
a lot of money.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.880
That is the part that the CSGO gambling stuff.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.760
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:10.200
That's the fucking shady part that no one anywhere, including Twitch should.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:16.200
And I'm surprised that these well, again, I'm not surprised, but you know that these

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.280
big name streamers on Twitch are willing to tie their entire identity to it.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.920
And none of them are going down with the ship, which is fascinating to me.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.640
But y'all make your choices about who you want to watch.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.200
Cool, cool.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.720
There's a lot of other streams out there.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.080
Like I know like on YouTube, I have a friend, a really good friend of mine who loves gambling

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:42.680
YouTube's and like so what she watches, she watches people go to Vegas and they film like

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.160
with it.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.720
I didn't even know Vegas will let you do this, but apparently they will because it's all

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.600
promo for them.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.080
They will film themselves playing slot machines and put it on.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:57.400
But they're walking into an establishment, playing the actual game and filming it and

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.480
then, you know, putting it out for better and for worse, because usually it goes the

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.920
other way onto YouTube.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.120
And I like there's big conventions for this stuff and all of it.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.880
But there's a huge key difference.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.080
It's not crypto.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:14.440
It's licensed in the US and it's the person that goes in and sits down at the machine

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:20.280
is getting the exact same thing that anyone who comes in and walks in place that machine

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:20.680
would get.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:28.760
So yeah, I've had someone made comments about how I don't know if they had gambling issues

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.480
or someone they knew had gambling issues that like watching these streams because like not

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:39.160
the obviously the crypto ones, but like the slots streams where they're not always winning.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:44.680
So it's not like, you know, it's kind of more reinforcing the fact that, yeah, you know,

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:50.040
I may have these, you know, compulsions to play slots, but there's a good chance I won't

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.920
win this stuff, like kind of bringing you back to reality, I guess, instead of, you

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.360
know, a big dopamine hit that, oh, my God, you're going to make so much money off this

01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:58.760
stuff.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:02.200
Yeah, that's kind of a unique tech.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.440
I haven't heard that before.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:08.760
But yeah, I know some of the people behind all this stuff like Pokemon and stuff like

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.000
that.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.720
I mean, let me get into it.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.080
There are strangers of controversy.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:13.800
Let's put it that way.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.440
There's a lot of comments in chat here over twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.160
I want to get to some of these tape plays games.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.280
A lot of good insight here saying hate raids against 10 viewer count.

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.040
People are irrelevant to Twitch.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:31.400
The site is so insanely top heavy that unless it's an issue impacting the top 5% of streamers,

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.120
Twitch is going to give us platitudes and empty promises.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.560
Correct statement.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:38.840
It sucks.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.600
But that is the way it's been for a lot of things.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.240
YouTube is honestly no different in that regard.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:50.440
And a lot of these sites, you know, they're going to cater to the people that are having

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.040
the most views and all of this stuff.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.880
And, you know, to hell with the 10 viewers and so forth, which sucks.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:02.040
It was only when all of those 10 viewer channels banded together and put their foot down and

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.560
said, this shit needs to change.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.000
Now, Twitch, the Twitch finally came out and I'm talking about the hate raids, of course,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.160
finally came out and did something and, you know, showed the new tools and the changes

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:17.880
they were doing with all of this that I hope we continue to hear more about how people

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.840
can protect themselves from harassment on this platform at TwitchCon, because we know

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:26.920
they're saving something under the curtain to unveil at the TwitchCon keynote.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.840
There's going to be some silly new feature that's going to make Twitch money because

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.880
Twitch really needs to make money right now based on some of these other things Loki's

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.360
going to get to.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.400
But what I think I'd love to hear more about and I'm sure DarkSakura would love to hear

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.760
more about and lots of people out there would love to hear more about is, again, how can

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:48.120
I what are the tools to better protect myself from harassment on this platform in order

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.360
for me to invest myself more in it?

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.760
So that would be what I'd love to hear in a keynote.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.920
Anyway, let me get some more comments from chat.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:59.400
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, but what if you have a podcast or talk show on Twitch where

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.600
you're talking about gambling and crypto, giving people advice about gambling and crypto?

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.960
Aren't those just as bad?

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.680
Kind of, it's all in how it's framed.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.560
I would say kind of, yes, because you're glamorizing it.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:21.880
But are you taking the responsibility to say, while you're saying that, to also say, here

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.600
are some issues, here are some things you can look for to see if you might be addicted

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.480
to gambling.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:31.400
And I'm not talking about just throwing out a 1-800 ever and saying, if you or somebody

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.320
have a loved one have a gambling problem, call 1-800.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:42.120
No, no, that is that is that there is no meat on that bone that you're throwing that crowd.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.080
Okay, there's not even meat on that bone.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.760
At least taking some steps on how to identify.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:57.720
And again, I would say the really big issue is the site paying the streamer to gamble

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.000
and win so that other people are encouraged to do that.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.960
That was the big problem there.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.760
Buying reviews.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.560
Well, yeah, it's buying reviews.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.360
It really is.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:13.160
And I want to get to this where Tay plays games, says in chat, morality for those people

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.160
tends to go out the window when they're quite literally making millions of dollars from

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.080
streaming deals with crypto gambling.

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.920
Not saying it's right or that I agree with it, but it's very understandable why people

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.040
would sell their souls.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:31.400
And that's a very I'm trying to get the right word here, but it's a good point.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.480
And it's just one of those things where it's one of those some pills are hard to swallow

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.400
and that is that is a hard one to swallow.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:43.080
But absolutely true is that everybody has a price and some are just showing theirs pretty

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:43.880
openly with this.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.320
So that's legit.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.680
Tay also.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.200
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:54.040
I'm just saying how much is your are your ethics worth?

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:54.540
Yeah.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.720
Tay in chat also says, agreed, Rob.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:01.480
Solidarity means banding together to protect ourselves because we sure as fuck won't get

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.520
it from Twitch, nor will we get support from the largest streamers.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.960
They won't rock the boat.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:11.400
So I'm glad, though, at least the small streamers are holding the large streamers accountable

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.000
with a lot of this.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:13.960
With a lot of this.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.160
So and we should always continue to do so.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:22.680
So let's see, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, there are those coin machine games drop a

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:27.880
coin and it pushed the other coins down on YouTube that are strangely pleasing to watch.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:35.480
But again, I feel like, again, doing YouTube's of those where you're walking into a Dave

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:40.360
and Busters or whatever it is and it ethically you're all you're doing is you're just filming

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.400
what you're doing anyway.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.880
You're not getting paid by the site to do it.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.960
The odds are no better or worse than any other person that would walk in there.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.640
So your odds are you're going to see defeat more than you see winning.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.480
I think there's a lot of stuff there where it's like, you know, I understand it.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:00.760
And actually, you know, again, a lot of people might scratch the itch, so to speak, by watching

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.280
that stuff on YouTube as opposed to going down and spending a bunch of money themselves.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.960
So I see some things out of it that might be good as well.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.200
I see them as very, very different things.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:16.200
DGRMS and chat says on a side note, I know someone who lost his fiance over gambling.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:23.320
He kept spending his money on gotcha games, and that's a very good reminder, especially

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:26.920
as we're talking about this Madden stuff at the top of the show and all this other stuff.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.840
Very good reminder that gambling is not just 777.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:36.520
There is much other different forms of gambling than just 777.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:41.480
And of course, you know, I'm speaking about a slot machine when, you know, that whole

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:49.560
thing you're talking about Final Fantasy 7, where you get the all sevens and then I sure

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:50.120
am not.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.000
Hi, Siri.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:51.960
Yeah, sorry.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:58.680
Sometimes I go on rants and Siri thinks I'm talking to her fill of nine, fill of nine

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.040
and chat says money and profit are always prioritized.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:05.960
And especially when we hear and I got to let Loki get to these other parts of things going

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.800
on with which when we hear about some of these, oh, yes, profit is very much prioritized

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.200
right now.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.920
I want to get to some of these other comments in chat.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.720
Godets says I can't tell if it's because of the drama recently or because gambling agencies

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.680
are looking to broadcast elsewhere, but I've been seeing ads for gambling websites recently

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:28.120
when I never used to see them because people are starting to find loopholes with gambling

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.520
laws is a huge part of it.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:34.840
And I think while it's still open season on this stuff until they lock some of it down,

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.400
I believe we have propositions on the ballot here in California about very much this sort

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:39.880
of thing.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.440
My gosh, yeah, we had.

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.920
Yeah, they're doing some crazy claims about different things on.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:50.760
I've seen commercials because I'm watching Peacock now and they have commercials.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.120
It's everywhere.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.440
So let's see.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:00.120
And TigerClaw in chat says gambling can really affect one's mental health.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.320
Absolutely.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:06.840
I mean, when we talk about gambling addiction, that is a mental health problem at the end

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.040
of the day, right?

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.360
And some people have to admit that they may have a problem.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.000
And again, it is much more than saying, you know, if you or a loved one have a gambling

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.560
problem, call 1-800-STOP-GAMBLING or whatever the number is like in such a half-assed thing

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.680
to try to cover your ass.

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:26.760
I think you have to really talk about like if you're again to answer the question that

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:30.760
came up earlier about what if I have a podcast that talks about this type of stuff you need

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:36.200
to really focus and give long, hard insight as to what gambling might look like.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.560
So it's not just slot machines and Kino, you know?

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.320
Well, and it's gotcha in this too.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.120
Absolutely.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.920
Card packs, booster packs, all of it.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:49.640
Yeah, all of it.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:56.760
I mean, anything that has some sort of random chance is technically a gamble.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:05.560
Um, but it's all in the way it's done.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:10.120
If it's, it's just, it's just really, really sticky.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:16.600
I mean, and if one wants to really, you know, go into it every day, you make a decision

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:24.200
as a gamble, but those decisions aren't necessarily ones that are going to ruin your life and

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:30.920
the lives of others, or, or especially you remember, um, when we did Neopets back in

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:37.320
the day and Gaia online, those things were technically kid gambling, you know, they had

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.960
some of those different aspects in it, you know?

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:45.480
I mean, hell, uh, both of them had their own freaking stock markets practically.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.320
Speaking of kid gambling, this is where the chat comments are going right now.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:53.240
Tiger Claw in chat points out Pokemon Go is a gotcha as well.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:53.960
Absolutely.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.080
Absolutely.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:00.280
Um, Tay plays games says you guys didn't talk about it, but one other point, Twitch

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.760
sorts by default from highest to lowest.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:07.720
And this site is visited by a lot of kids who literally see the top 10 streams and two

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.960
or three of them are shady crypto slots.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.400
That type of content is very front and center to developing minds.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.240
Oh, that is an excellent point.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.960
Although, and I'm not, I'm not trying to, what about your point?

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.040
I do want to make sure you're yes.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:25.000
That point I did notice though within the past week and a half or so that Twitch stopped

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.160
showing me viewers high to low, even with my own following list.

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:32.840
And now it shows me who you most want to watch.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.000
We think I hate that.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:35.800
I hate it.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.360
I hate it.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:36.920
I hate it.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.640
I only care about the people I'm following because I followed them for a reason.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.140
Yeah.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.920
So anyway, all right.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.440
We have talked about, oh, Tay plays game says I'm part of an experiment.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.200
It's not like that for everyone yet.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:58.040
Well, I'm open to experimenting, you know, I wish I would have been asked first, but

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:58.520
that's all right.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:58.760
Okay.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:03.000
So I didn't know that wasn't open to everyone first, but again, I'm not trying to dismiss

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.720
the point.

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.640
I just try to, I have it right now.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.120
Yeah.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:11.240
I was thinking in my brain, I was like, is that why Twitch did that was to try to get

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.040
away from that.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.440
But I sort of think at the end of the day, especially if you're new to Twitch and you

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:20.600
haven't established that pattern of what you like, then of course they're going to show

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:26.040
you the top streams and a lot of it's going to fall into this whole type of thing.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:32.440
So I do have to say, though, that the streams that's been showing me lately are people

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.880
that I'm already following.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.640
So maybe it is working.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.040
I don't know.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:40.040
Derek JH in chat says, but with my special system, I can't lose.

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.240
It's like free money.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:46.600
Oh, well, you must be in the same program that XQC did I name names that those folks

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:52.280
are in that are playing those games online that basically the house is giving them money

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.480
and the house is letting them win.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.240
You must be in that same program.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:55.880
Congrats.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:00.200
He's the good guy because he's giving back half of the money that that guy scammed the

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:00.920
other people out of.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.000
So he's the good guy, right?

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.640
Anyway, there's been more Twitch drama this week.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.720
I mean, that's enough Twitch drama to fill a week.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.320
But let's let's talk about.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.240
But wait, there's more.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:13.720
There's more.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:23.320
So then Twitch decided to come out and tell everybody about their brand new revenue split.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.280
That's right.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:30.680
So now what they're going to be doing as well is they're going to be updating the monetization

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.520
of some of their larger partners.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:41.720
Um, I think it's really right now, some of the partners have a special 70 30 revenue

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.520
split right now.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.480
But that's going to change to 50 50.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:52.600
What they're saying is they're basically going to the ones that have that special, I guess,

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.600
deal right now it's going to be for the first 100,000 that they make are going to be 70 30.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.280
Then afterwards, it's going to be 50 50.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.240
And then everything else is going to be 50 50.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:06.040
The reason why they're losing people, the reason why and this is the best part, this

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.720
is some mental gymnastics for you.

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:13.080
The reason why they say they need to drop that split and take more of that money, by

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:18.440
the way, also pushing more ads on the platform that also hurt people finding new streamers

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.120
is because Amazon Web Services is expensive.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:33.960
And it's just too expensive for them to run a company that uses Amazon Web Services.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.320
Because that that company Amazon just charges them too much.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.000
Wait, hold on a second.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.680
No, no, they're owned by Amazon.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.240
So that doesn't make any goddamn sense.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:50.200
So they're basically saying that, you know, Daddy company is charging me too much money

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.880
for this company to run.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:52.380
What?

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.360
Like, that doesn't make any sense.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.160
But that's the excuse is that it costs too much to run.

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:03.960
So their revenues, they tried to put out that stat that was like somebody who streams for

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:11.960
what was it for 100 concurrent viewers, 200 hours would cost them like 1500 bucks or so.

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:17.960
I don't know what the what the number was more than that it was it was for 100 concurrent

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:25.240
streamer or 100 concurrent viewers for 200 hours a month are more than a thousand costs

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.720
more than $1,000 per month for them.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.560
Let's put it this way.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:37.720
If you are a streamer, that's making that's that's putting out 200 hours worth of streams

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.360
in a month.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.000
That's a lot of that's a lot of stream time.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.360
And you're holding 100 concurrent concurrent viewers through them.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:50.440
You are by far in the top percentage, probably decimal fractional percentage of Twitch and

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.000
crypto gambling sites probably want to partner with you.

01:16:54.040 --> 01:17:00.920
Like that's a lot of money you would probably be making a ton of money from just streaming

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:06.280
in general, that they would be taking a portion of anyways, yes, telling me that you can't

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:13.480
pay $100 or $1,000 to run that, that that's too much for you, which I don't believe because

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.120
Amazon's a trillion dollar company.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.480
And like, I just don't believe that.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:19.960
I'm sorry.

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:20.680
It just doesn't.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.480
Who are you trying to convince here?

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.760
Here's the thing.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:30.440
And did your own mess and chat says if you're pulling 100 K a month, the 70 30 split ain't

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.640
going to break your bank.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.760
It's actually it's 100 K on a rotating calendar year.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.520
So but that's still you know, you're talking about people that I have 100 and that's just

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.880
what they're making off Twitch.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:44.520
That doesn't count any type of other licensing deals, sponsorship deals, merchandise deals,

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:50.600
direct PayPal donations and things of that sort, convention appearances for some of them

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.960
and those sorts of things.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.480
So it's 100 K on a rotating.

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:56.680
I mean, but that's still that's a decent chunk of change, right?

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:57.480
And here's the thing.

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:02.040
If you're pulling 100 K a month, the 70 30 split ain't going to break your bank.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.800
And there is a part of me that certainly lands on that side of the fence where it's like,

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.800
well, it's hard to feel super innocent.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:08.920
Isn't this interesting?

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:13.560
My how the tables have turned because now here's something where the partners could

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.720
really use the little people in this fight.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:28.440
Anyway, but I think where this bothers people is there were a lot of people at that affiliate

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:36.280
level that wanted to grow into 70 30 and had those dreams of getting bigger and so forth

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:41.560
and so on that now they're not going to be able to do because, oh, Twitch is starting

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.160
to pull back a little bit.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:48.920
And I think, again, another big problem here is optics, optics, messaging, messaging.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.560
And very clearly, this statement that has come out.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:59.720
Has this issues was not run by any sort of audience that was going to give an honest

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:05.560
feedback and honest assessment of what was going on with this statement and so forth.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:11.160
Because a smarter way to have rolled out a message like this would have been we're going

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:17.160
to be changing the split here, but here's another way that you can earn money or here's

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.480
something else we're going to be putting in place.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.800
Well, they're upping their ad revenue split.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:28.520
So you get 55 percent of that now, which is beans from the vast majority of people.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:34.760
And the only way you do that is to opt into three minutes of ads in an hour, which I think

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:38.040
you can time the ad yourself.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:41.960
Most people are too lazy to do so, so they run the automatic ads.

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.880
I've gotten on this boat before.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:49.480
I don't want to repeat myself too much, but I'm just going to say automatic ads on a small

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:54.920
channel, you are kneecapping yourself severely to growth.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:00.280
Huge difference, huge, I want to make sure I'm clear, huge difference between automatic

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.840
ads and I need to go poop.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.360
I'm going to run an ad while I'm pooping.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:09.880
Because with an automatic ad, you're missing content and I can't tell you how annoyed.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.040
Nothing gets me to turn a channel off faster.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:15.400
And there are some big streamers that do this, even ones that play Dead by Daylight.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.240
I'll be watching and they're right at the end of the match.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.600
It's like, oddly enough, it's all killer streams I've seen do this.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.840
Watching a match and are they about to get a forehook?

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:30.600
Oh, and then an ad jumps in, cuts off the rest of the match and comes back to the screen

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.080
where everybody's going and it's the wrap up of the match.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:37.240
So I completely missed the climax of the match because the automatic ad, I turn those

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:37.880
streams off.

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:44.360
I unfollow them if I'm unfollowing the streamer, because that is garbage content that they're

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.240
putting out.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.440
And that is the truth.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.400
Experimented with the automatic ads.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.800
Oh, you experimented with them?

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.080
I experimented with it.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:58.120
I did it for like a month because I figured a month would be enough time to see how well

01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:58.920
it worked.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:06.440
I did the recommended thing to get the 55% revenue, whatever that Twitch was preaching.

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:12.440
And I found it to be more annoying than anything else.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:18.600
So I'm doing another experiment right now where I'm doing a 30-second ad once an hour

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:23.160
to see if it's any better for people.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.240
Because honestly enough, I'm going to forget.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:37.320
Um, and so far, I think it's been a little bit less obtrusive, although I will sometimes

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:40.200
go ahead and just run one to run one instead.

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:48.360
But I really did not like that, that three minutes every hour bullshit.

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.400
I thought that it really annoyed people.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:56.920
People would complain about the ads more to the point where I'm like, yes, I know, stop

01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:01.880
telling me, you know, and now I'm there.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:07.720
There's a benefit to having automatic ads if it's not something that you would likely

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:08.920
remember to do.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:14.200
But I have mine set at the very bare minimum, and I'm going to see exactly how it works.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:21.320
While I completely respect whatever choices you want to make with your content, I just

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:28.040
even with the short ads, really think about what content you might be sacrificing to do

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.000
that because we talked about earlier, how much is your content worth?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.760
And I just testing it out.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.600
Yeah, that's all I'm doing is testing it.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.720
I would be curious if you look at the revenue you make off that I think you're really going

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.600
to assess the same worth it just about nothing.

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:44.600
I mean, to be perfectly honest, I've switched it back about two weeks ago.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:50.840
And I don't see any point I would it's like you were saying earlier, I'd rather run the

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:54.840
ad when I go to the bathroom, you know, exactly all the time.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:58.680
Well, it's a good idea to just get stretch and hydrate once an hour.

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:01.320
Anyway, it's a good reminder to you to do that, right?

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:07.080
Well, I mean, this is why I stream when I do because I, I start at four, five o'clock,

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.760
I go feed the cat, you know?

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.260
Yeah.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:12.280
And but I wanted to see how it worked.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:19.080
I figured giving myself a few weeks of of testing it to see how it is in the real world.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:25.800
I would rather participate in it and form an opinion based on my, my experience, then

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.080
to, I guess, read and guess about it, I would rather see it in action.

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:34.760
And now that I've seen it in action, I can flat out say, yeah, shit.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:40.760
And thank you for reminding me, I meant to change mine back this week.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.920
Nothing wrong with an educated perspective.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:45.640
I'm not gonna exactly I want on that.

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:55.640
I'm a firm believer that, I mean, I think that you can form a better opinion when you're

01:23:55.640 --> 01:24:02.360
in the situation, you know, rather than just on looking at the straight details of it.

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:05.240
And I wanted to see how is this working?

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.000
I'm not a big streamer.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.840
It's not gonna affect me that badly to test it out.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.720
Um, but honestly, it was it was it was shit.

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:17.800
It was really shit.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.080
It was annoying.

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:25.320
And I would watch because whenever I'm playing, I keep my dashboard open so that I can see

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:32.120
when the ads are coming up and when my pre the pre roll is disabled and all of that.

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:38.440
And it was just as easy for me to set it when I got the warning about about pre roll coming

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:38.920
up.

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:39.980
Yeah.

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:44.680
Now going to some of the comments from chat as she 100 Matt says, I think going from 70 30

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:47.320
to 50 50 is a big shift on short notice.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.840
Folks have made this into a career.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:52.040
If your employer is telling you they're going to be taking out for more of your paycheck,

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.040
don't be surprised if your employees leave.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:59.160
And I think a big thing I'm hearing everywhere right now is diversify, diversify, diversify.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:03.480
Do not put all of your eggs into twitches basket, which is exactly what which does not

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.960
need people doing right now if they really are in these, you know, dire financial straits.

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.240
And that goes back to the comments.

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.440
Somebody had talked about a billion.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:15.000
Oh, as Joe and Hunter Matt said to play devil's advocate, Amazon spent a lot of money, 1 billion

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.120
to acquire Twitch.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:20.280
If the service by itself is not returning on that investment as readily, why not reduce

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:20.920
the split?

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:24.600
If Twitch is Amazon's weakest revenue, just speculating, but don't know for sure.

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.600
Why not try to get more out of it?

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:33.720
It's just all of the money arguments are really hard to look at when you look at how much

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.080
Jeff Bezos puts in his pocket every minute.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:42.360
Versus from nothing is pretty, pretty bullshit.

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:49.800
That's that's that's the very hard pill to swallow is that that's what makes all of this

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:54.920
like it look like look like bullshit and all is just because meanwhile, Jeff Bezos is still

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:55.880
pocketing how much?

01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.200
And I'm supposed to feel sorry for the bitch, I don't.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:09.000
The thing is, is that if they expected to make a lot of money on people playing video

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.800
games, they shouldn't have.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:16.440
They should have just stuck with our cloud service and not deal with Twitch.

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.640
Twitch is kind of a niche.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.520
I'm going to say it.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:26.040
I mean, with as big as the as the events that they have and some of the streamers that they

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:30.120
have, it's still, you know, it's not something I would have expected to be.

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.960
A very big moneymaker.

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.240
I'm just going to be honest.

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:33.740
Yeah.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.840
Quest Buster in chat says a streamer I sometimes watch has shifted more of their effort to

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.320
making YouTube content after one of their videos went viral for them and started generating

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.280
more revenue for them.

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:46.760
They get a few hundred viewers per stream.

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.280
Now they put a lot of work into making YouTube videos based on topics they want to cover

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.160
and get a solid return and haven't been shy about saying that.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.720
Yeah, YouTube makes me a lot more money at this point than Twitch.

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:57.880
But here's one of the problems.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:03.640
YouTube could also go ass up and do something that is not.

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.960
We've seen them do this before with copyright strikes, banning channels that shouldn't

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:11.480
be banned, silencing, shifting revenue streams.

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.960
YouTube is not some fucking holy land.

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.760
Let's get that 100% clear.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.560
YouTube has problems all of its own.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:25.880
So if you think the grass is greener over on YouTube, have fun when you take that Astro

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.800
turf injury in fall fall hard.

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:33.320
Well, I'm just saying right now with YouTube, they're doing I mean, and we're we can only

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.200
talk about the present.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.360
I mean, obviously, we don't know what the future is going to hold.

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:42.600
But right now, the moves that they're making are seem to be benefiting content creators.

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:46.920
So they're adding a way to monetize shorts now.

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:52.840
And they're allowing, you know, ways to get more into a partner program with with the

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:53.880
shorts as well.

01:27:53.880 --> 01:28:00.840
They're introducing a new music monetization system that you'll be able to license music,

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:06.120
like, and even with the shorts, you can use licensed music in your shorts.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:10.040
So they're they're making it a little bit easier in that sense, you know, to do that.

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:15.400
Honestly, I probably will be streaming from YouTube, because Twitch does.

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.880
It's not really a growth avenue for me.

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:25.400
I think I think I have a better chance of getting revenue from YouTube than I do from

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.200
Twitch.

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.640
And that's totally fair.

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.560
You got to do what speaks to you.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.200
Absolutely.

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:35.880
Let's see a entertainment says they monetize shorts to compete with TikTok and Instagram.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.440
Yep.

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:39.800
Bobby Black Wolf says to be fair, Loki's audience is already on YouTube.

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.840
So makes sense to stream.

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:41.880
They're also true.

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.440
Let's see other comments here.

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.320
Take place game says Twitch is giving us numbers based on Amazon Web Services, which they

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.640
themselves fucking own is insulting.

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:55.640
Business wise, those costs are 100% written off as operating losses.

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.960
So Amazon can reduce their taxes anyway.

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.200
Oh, 100% don't pay any tax.

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:08.840
The messaging was so bad in how they delivered this news so bad that it really makes you

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.320
wonder if they even bothered to proofread the stinking product.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:18.920
Godets and chat says I will say candidly, this sort of thing talking about a response

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:21.640
to fifth dream saying let's demand a return to Justin TV.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:24.440
I will say candidly, this sort of thing screams opportunity.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:28.200
YouTube's been falling flat on streaming service improvements, although they are trying.

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:31.080
I wonder if any other service can come around to eat Twitch.

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.960
Well, thank God Facebook has finally realized they aren't it because that was that was the

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.600
one service I did not want in this fucking.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:39.640
Yeah.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:45.080
And unfortunately, we need to have like Twitch to survive, too, because competition is the

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.560
only thing that's going to make these things better because the Twitch goes under.

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:51.160
Well, all that nice stuff with YouTube we were just talking about.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.040
Bye bye.

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:56.120
And it was like there's a couple comments in chat talking about Mixer.

01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:01.720
And I agree, like Mixer, I'm still a little surprised at how Mixer kind of finished.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:05.720
I mean, yes, I guess there were management leadership problems at Mixer, but it's one

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:13.400
of those things where it's like, dang, like Mixer in the mix right now would really change

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:14.600
this game a lot.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.840
I hope Microsoft, to some degree, still recognizes that.

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:25.720
Oh, for the record, I just turned off ads manager

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:30.840
and they gave me a big old survey to fill out because they want to know why.

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:37.480
And I think it's very interesting that that they're taking the feedback on it, like even

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:40.760
to the point, oh, you might win an Amazon gift card.

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:41.800
I'm like, I could use it right now.

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.560
I need all my, you know, cosplay stuff.

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:47.960
But the other thing on there, though, that I wish that they would switch to if they're

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:52.360
going to do ads are the stream display ads that they have.

01:30:53.640 --> 01:31:00.120
Where your window gets a little bit smaller and you have a little banner underneath it

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.400
and it's not obtrusive.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.680
You're not missing content.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.520
Yeah, absolutely.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.240
I want to get one more comment here from TayPlaysGames.

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:14.280
Now I got to move on because it's already an hour and a half in the show.

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.120
So we got to pick it up with these other news stories.

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:17.000
But this is good stuff.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I'm not, you know, we talk about what needs to be talked about.

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:26.760
TayPlaysGames says Facebook gaming was embarrassing, but I know multiple queer streamers were offered

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:28.680
one year Facebook gaming contracts.

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:32.360
They got their bag, held their tongues for a year, and now are back on Twitch.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.880
I say make that paper, babes.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:35.400
Absolutely.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:36.280
Make that coin.

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:40.520
I mean, I'm not watching, but, you know, profit off other people do it.

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:43.080
Like, you know, take the moment.

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.000
Honestly, I still wouldn't have done it because I don't want to support Facebook.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:47.480
Yeah.

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.480
Well, everybody's got a price.

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:51.720
I'm speaking for me anyway.

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.560
Would I would I have shut my fucking mouth?

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.320
For the right price.

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:57.720
So all right.

01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.120
Well, yeah.

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.680
But then again, when's the last time I looked at my face?

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.760
But let's be clear, it's a high price.

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.560
Okay.

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:04.060
Yeah.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:06.040
All right.

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:11.880
Like if they're going to pay me enough to be off work for a year and pay all my medical

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.640
bills, then yeah, I'll do that.

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.400
I'll take a leave of absence from work.

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.520
I'll stream for a year and then I'll shit talk them after.

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:23.080
If if I suddenly come around and I start saying, oh, I love Facebook.

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.200
Facebook's a great thing.

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.120
I can't wait to do more stuff.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:27.720
I'm going to partner up with Facebook.

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.880
One of two things happened, I guarantee you.

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:32.520
Number one, somebody paid me a lot of money.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:35.160
Number two, Zuckerberg is no longer the CEO.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.440
One of those two things happened.

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:39.560
Blink once if they have you blink twice.

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.480
All right.

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:47.560
You know, what would be funny is to take that money and then put it toward the anti-Facebook

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:48.200
legislation.

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.080
Hey, all this money you gave us.

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:55.000
Yeah, we're going to use it to piss in your cornflakes, Facebook.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:55.500
Just saying.

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.800
All right, let's move on.

01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.720
Let's talk about some other gaming news.

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:03.800
We may have to touch on some of these a little bit faster just because we're already an hour

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:04.840
and a half into the show.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.000
I want to get to this next story, which has to do.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.600
And by the way, great discussion, everyone.

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:13.480
And I invite further discussion over on Twitter at twitter.com slash O L R.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:20.760
Or you can also send us an email at participate at orange lounge radio.com.

01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:24.200
Again, that's participate at orange lounge radio.com.

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:30.840
So moving on, let's talk about the Xbox Series X and a change that happened there.

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:34.840
The digital rights management for Xbox one games.

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:40.200
So if you have no access to playing Xbox one games, because it's trying to do an online

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:45.800
check to balance the digital rights management issues, then you no longer have to worry about

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.040
that with the latest Series X update.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:53.880
This was confirmed by engineering lead Eda Marie and a tweet saying, yes, this is true.

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:59.160
Since the 2206 update, we examined data since Series X and S launch and determined that

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:03.800
the online compatibility check isn't needed in the vast majority of cases for Xbox one

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:04.440
discs.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:09.800
Some games may still need to be updated online after install to ensure the best experience.

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:13.640
And that's, you know, we're talking about games with gigantic patches, like, say, No

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.000
Man's Sky, right?

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.400
Like that game just isn't going to play the same at all if you don't update it.

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.080
So there is that.

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:23.480
Let's see.

01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:27.240
I think that's really all I want to say.

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:32.760
There are some other exceptions, like Forza Horizon 5 or Halo Infinite, because the discs

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.920
don't contain the full version of the game.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.480
So you still need an internet connection to actually get the full versions of those games.

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:43.720
And we've seen that happen a lot where, you know, what does a disc really mean anymore?

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:44.200
Right.

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:45.800
So, yeah.

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:48.600
What's the list for this Xbox one games, though?

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:50.920
Yes, I thought I made that clear.

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.600
This is just for Xbox one games.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:57.000
This does not affect any Series X thing that's always online.

01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:00.440
I don't know how many of those really require always.

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.280
I mean, with so many games as a service these days and so forth, I don't know how many of

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.960
them really require always online.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:10.360
But it is this is specifically addressing Xbox one related issues.

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:12.300
Yeah.

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.360
All right, moving on.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.560
This is an interesting story.

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:16.200
Dark Sakura.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:23.800
Yeah, well, and you know how I like to look into the bigger world of video games and how

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.440
it affects, you know, social elements.

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:37.800
So the Department of Homeland Security has given an almost $700,000 grant to terrorism

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:43.160
and security researchers to investigate radicalization through video games.

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:49.640
They're going to the Middlebury Institute Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:57.160
or CTEC, which is a nonprofit organization called Take This and another company that's

01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:00.680
looking to curb toxic behavior called Logically.

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:06.520
And I'll go ahead and read the quote from the grant announcement.

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:11.160
Over the past decade, video games have increasingly become focal points of social activity and

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.280
identity creation for adolescents and young adults.

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:19.080
Relationships made and fostered within game ecosystems routinely cross over into the real

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.520
world and are impactful parts of local communities.

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:27.400
Correspondingly, extremists have used video games and targeted video game communities

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.960
for activities ranging from propaganda creation to terrorist mobilization and training.

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:38.280
I'm going to take a sidestep on that one because I have been following the keffles situation

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.880
very, very actively.

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:48.600
And I honestly think that this goes into it with, you know, Kiwi farms.

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:55.640
They were, you know, sort of fostering those environments on their site and targeting a

01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:02.760
lot of different streamers, different people that were active in the video game community

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.520
that are also activists.

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:09.560
So I think that that's a related item.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:10.920
We've seen it very recently.

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:20.680
So one of the goals is that they want to monitor and evaluate extremist activities, and then

01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:29.240
they want to train others for monitoring, detection, and prevention of, as I say, extremist

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:36.200
exploitation in gaming spaces for community managers, multiplayer designers, lore developers,

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:39.560
mechanic designers, and trust and safety professionals.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:52.280
Um, they are looking at all kinds of different video game studios, you know, from big to

01:37:52.280 --> 01:38:00.200
small that don't really understand how their games could be exploited for radicalization.

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:07.240
In fact, and then we've even seen this too, going back to the situation with Kiwi farms.

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:13.240
Um, white nationalists have been digging into gaming space.

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:24.520
There's groups on Steam that are openly neo-Nazi and, you know, glorifying, you know,

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:28.840
domestic terrorism, you know, like school shooters and the like.

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:35.400
When I look at this, though, I'm kind of like, I don't think this is the video game's fault.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.840
This is the internet's fault.

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.840
This is internet radicalization.

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:39.160
All right.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:43.960
And I think that they're dealing with one of the layers of it.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:46.120
And I kind of see their approach on this one.

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:51.160
What they're wanting to do is like, while Steam has banned a lot of these groups,

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.120
these people want to go further and get them where they start.

01:38:55.880 --> 01:39:02.680
They actually did a presentation at this year's Game Developers Conference

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:09.560
um, that their focus is going to be on the white nationalism supremacy front.

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:19.720
Um, because of a lot of the more racially motivated mass shootings, like the one in Buffalo.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.240
Um, because that was broadcast on Twitch,

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:30.920
live with people dying and being injured on stream.

01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:40.360
And I think that it's like you said, it's not just, you know, video games,

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:47.640
but I think that some of the online spaces around it have been hotbeds for negativity.

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:54.680
You know, we're, we're seeing, you know, just, just in general, you know, I mean,

01:39:55.160 --> 01:40:01.080
the hate raids aside, I've been in my friends channels and had people come in and start

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:08.360
harassing them for their, uh, their sexual and gender orientation.

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:17.240
Um, I've actually had someone come in my channel and, and, uh, start spouting, uh, Nazi rhetoric.

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.800
Just because I have the Jewish label up on my channel.

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:29.000
I've had people come into my channel and tell me that I need hormone treatment because I'm ace.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:38.120
Um, completely unsolicited, which I mean, 90% of it is unsolicited.

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:45.880
But, you know, for some of our, you know, my, uh, streamers of color, some of my friends,

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:51.320
they've, they've said there's a whole lot worse, of course, that comes in

01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:53.880
and on their channel.

01:40:53.880 --> 01:41:05.080
And, and I think the big thing, you know, on it is that it is something I'm glad that they're

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.240
looking at the sources and how it comes together.

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:15.080
Because I think if you can dismantle the, how the, the source of it,

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:22.440
you know, then to use, you know, the, the, the Hydra, you know, uh, analogy,

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:25.560
you know, you cut off one head and five more spawn.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.720
Well, that's, you have to cut off the base.

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.800
That's what they're talking about in chat right now.

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:31.720
You know, talking about things like 4chan.

01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:35.480
So going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:40.760
says there are thousands of these site and platforms that are just cesspools and recruitment

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:41.400
centers.

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:46.120
For instance, if federal agencies don't have a massive team monitoring 4chan, like a hawk,

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:47.240
then they're doing it wrong.

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:52.120
But if they ever shut down 4chan, thousands of other ones will pop up in its place.

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:55.720
So diversifying their counterintelligence will hopefully stop more attacks.

01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:00.280
I also think what Tay says here is a huge, important point.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:05.240
And again, why, why my brain, like, I understand why they're looking at the gaming culture,

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.960
but my brain says this is an internet problem.

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.400
And this is huge.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:10.600
What Tay is saying in chat.

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:16.360
Take place game says I'm less concerned about video games than I am about YouTube algorithms.

01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:22.120
And I actually would personally, I would say any social media algorithm pushing out far

01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:27.320
right content to kids, because this is something Facebook is also extremely guilty of is pushing

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:33.080
maybe less the targeting kids part, but bubbling that garbage and misinformation up.

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:40.760
And it's, you know, there's on all sides to they put it's that echo chamber of confirmation

01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:41.480
bias.

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:41.980
Yes.

01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:49.640
So that's that's what needs to be looked at is how we're bubbling the extremities to the

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:50.140
top.

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:57.800
And yeah, it's that's that's a bigger problem than any video game, in my opinion.

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:03.160
Well, and I think though, that they have to start somewhere.

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:10.600
And we, I think by, I'm not saying that it's right to target one community over another.

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:17.480
But, you know, they say that the, the, the bent nail gets hammered down first.

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:26.040
And I think that, of course, video games have often been the scapegoat of many of the people

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:26.540
in charge.

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:33.020
But the fact that we're actually seeing that they have evidence to support that this is a part

01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:36.780
of it, then I think they have to start somewhere.

01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:37.180
Yeah.

01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:47.020
And on top of that, though, logically is actually a pretty, pretty good nonprofit that I'm not

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:51.580
nonprofit, but just company in general trying to curb the toxic behavior.

01:43:51.580 --> 01:44:02.220
And also to add to this, I got an email from Intel about a service that they have to, to

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:09.980
combat online toxicity in online gaming and in gaming chats.

01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:14.300
I joined in on that, although I haven't really seen anything more from it.

01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:25.580
Um, but I think that it's also, it's sad that the government needs to step in on something

01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:29.900
that people should just be putting down themselves.

01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:36.700
You know, that's why I supported Kefl's attempts with, with Kiwi Farms and now they're gone

01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:38.620
because a lot of us spoke up about it.

01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:43.180
And I think that we need to be the louder voices, the voices of reason.

01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:46.380
And, you know, call these people out.

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.460
Know what you're doing is not good.

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:53.420
You need to, you need to SDF you and, you know, go get that tree trunk out of your ass.

01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:55.900
Or maybe you need something up your ass.

01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:56.460
I don't know.

01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:57.740
To this story's point.

01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:05.500
Well, let's, let's not resort to that, but let's, you know, to this story's point, like,

01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:12.700
and with the video game stuff, at least these things that happen on Twitch and so forth

01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:16.940
in the gaming community and on Steam and in the space, at least they're trackable.

01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:19.180
At least you can see them at least.

01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:23.660
And so, so maybe I do understand why it does lure the government to that sort of space

01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:27.180
to be able to actually see it and monitor it a little more effectively.

01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:31.500
Because when I'm out playing Ingress and a car comes by and somebody leans out the

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:35.900
window and says faggot really loud out the window, that's not something that the government

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:36.940
can easily track.

01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:39.020
And if I complain about that, that's happening.

01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:41.980
That's just me being a baby and I need to grow a thicker skin.

01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:45.100
And I'm sorry if you don't like that word, but I don't like that word either.

01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:48.620
And I especially don't like it when it's yelled at me as it was in that situation that

01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:49.980
happened in the past couple months.

01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:52.140
Like I'm not talking about something that happened to me as a kid.

01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:56.540
For me, that's something that happened to me as a 40 year old man out playing, you know,

01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:59.980
Ingress and tapping my phone, which looks like Pokemon go.

01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:03.020
So therefore I must be a lesser than that.

01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:07.260
And that, and that's the issue when it really comes into stop being shits.

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:11.740
But unfortunately, if I yell back, don't be a shit, it's not heard.

01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:22.460
Well, and the, the thing about it is that there, this is all coming back to a, trying

01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.420
to think of the way to say it.

01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:27.740
Cause I'm not going to say that it's a mental health thing, but I think it's the way that

01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:33.420
people are being raised that there is this, and it's a very American thing.

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:38.620
I mean, I'm not saying that it's, it's isolated to America, but it is a very, very American

01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:49.660
thing where if you don't fit in with this one mold, and I'm going to say it right now.

01:46:49.660 --> 01:47:02.540
The quote default is white male, straight, cisgender, Christian, boring, vanilla person.

01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:03.100
You know what I mean?

01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:06.540
You know, that is default.

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:12.780
And this is something that as a female oriented person, I have grown up with my entire life

01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:18.220
being told that I can't do something because it's something that a guy does, you know,

01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:22.060
or, or that I'm going to be perceived a certain way.

01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:25.740
And I'm sure that you have just like what that other person you've experienced that

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:32.860
way, it's society reinforcing the stereotype and it needs to start at home.

01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:33.360
Yep.

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:35.580
It needs to start at home.

01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:41.180
It needs parents to be better to their kids than their parents were to them.

01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:41.680
Yeah.

01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:43.580
They need to break the mold.

01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:46.300
And, you know, thanks for the kind words and chat.

01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:47.660
I see people saying, sorry, that happened.

01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:48.140
That's fucked up.

01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:49.580
And so I do appreciate that.

01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:54.460
But like anyone who's different as dark star point out, anyone who has any element that's

01:47:54.460 --> 01:48:00.060
against the norm, quote unquote has experienced something similar and it sucks.

01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:03.100
And there's some that experience it a lot more often.

01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:08.220
And there's some that, you know, I, I just, it's, it's a problem.

01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:13.740
That's much bigger than what's, what, what's the video, what's the video game that's

01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:16.620
causing people to just, just do terrible things.

01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:19.660
It's, it's, it's no video game people.

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:27.020
No, it's people, but they're filtering it into games that have things to do with their

01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:28.940
viewpoint, you know?

01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:31.260
And I mean, but here's like a prime example.

01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:39.740
If you go say on a running webpage, tips for men learning to run, you know, have a anti

01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:44.780
chafe cream, you know, pick a good route, have good shoes.

01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:49.340
Women carry a whistle, use your headphones, have mace with you.

01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:51.820
Don't run at night.

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:55.900
You know, these double standards.

01:48:55.980 --> 01:49:01.900
And I just use that because it's the example that I, that I live, but these double standards

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:02.700
are everywhere.

01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:05.900
And that's why I'm saying it's a mold that needs to be broken.

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:08.300
It's built into our language.

01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:09.660
I know I've mentioned it before.

01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:14.620
I have a book I'm very fond of called manmade language by an Australian woman named Dale

01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:15.100
Spender.

01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:17.420
There are multiple versions of this book.

01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:21.340
She started it as her, I think her doctorate thesis in the seventies.

01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:31.340
But everything is built around this, this mold of straight white male, Christian, cisgender

01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:33.660
language is built that way.

01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:39.180
And I'm so glad that right now we have new terms being introduced.

01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:43.500
We have new concepts that are coming that there's a good number of people adopting.

01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:47.820
We're whittling away at it, but we need to do more.

01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:48.620
We need to do more.

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:54.060
Uh, fifth three men chat says I'm in quote, he fingers default in this country.

01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:57.900
And even me and my friends were threatened with weapons because we had nail polish and

01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:58.700
eyeliner on.

01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:01.580
I can't imagine what a lot of people have to go through.

01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:05.180
And it's, it's the fact that you kind of play.

01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:09.420
I mean, it was one could argue that the nail polish and eyeliner is, is gender expression

01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:10.700
and playing with that a little bit.

01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:14.620
Although I don't think that stuff has to be the mold.

01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:15.900
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:19.900
And to reinforce, I don't think those things have to be tied to any gender, but I think

01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:20.940
we understand that.

01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:26.940
Most of America does view that stuff as, as gender roles and you, you were outside of

01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:27.500
that.

01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:31.100
So, um, that's, that's why that happened masculinity.

01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:31.500
Yeah.

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:32.000
Yeah.

01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:38.060
Toxic masculinity hurts men as much as it hurts everybody else.

01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:41.340
People in that mold, you know, it's, it's.

01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:45.420
It's just, it's sick.

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:48.140
It's a sickness in society.

01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:55.500
And sadly, the sickness has been building for centuries, you know, for millennia.

01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:58.620
And we need to be better than it.

01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:03.820
We need to actually show that we need to be enlightened people and we need to learn from

01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:07.020
the past, but, oh no, learning from the past.

01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.940
What is this past thing you speak of?

01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:10.780
I don't want to think about these negative things.

01:51:10.780 --> 01:51:15.260
I'd rather be comfortable in my little mold that keeps me on top of the food chain.

01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:17.740
Sounds too progressive for me.

01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:20.780
All right, moving on.

01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:21.900
We do have a time.

01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:25.580
I wouldn't say constraint, but we are running a little long tonight, so I want to keep the

01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:26.700
news going.

01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:28.300
So let's get to our next story.

01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:28.800
Loki.

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:29.740
Yeah.

01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:34.220
Let's talk about, uh, another thing that also had the government coming after people.

01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:43.580
Well, I would assume, um, so Rockstar Games leak of Grand Theft Auto six, um, of course

01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:44.860
attracted a lot of attention.

01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:51.260
So, of course, they were locking, uh, Rockstar was locking social media.

01:51:52.380 --> 01:52:01.100
Um, apparently on the 18th of September, uh, GTA forums, uh, there was, um, I think they

01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:08.940
also did some, uh, they were, uh, taking down, of course, the poster of these leaks, um,

01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:13.660
their accounts on GTA forums, which isn't really owned by Rockstar Games, but whatever.

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:22.700
Um, and then of course, uh, there was also, um, different, uh, locked posts, like with

01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:27.580
tweets and Instagram posts that were taken down, uh, DMCA type stuff as well.

01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:31.740
So they were trying to, you know, kind of get a hold of any of the videos that were

01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:33.180
being out, you know, spread out there.

01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:34.780
They were taking those all down.

01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:43.340
Um, and then we have news that the city of London police have, uh, posted that on Thursday,

01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:50.220
22nd, they have arrested a 17 year old, um, in Oxford on suspicion of hacking as part

01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:57.420
of the investigation into, uh, was it the Uber and Rockstar Games hacks.

01:52:57.420 --> 01:53:02.460
Apparently this person was believed to be connected with the group, uh, lapses.

01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:10.460
And they had, um, apparently hacked lots of different companies, including, uh, Microsoft,

01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:19.100
Cisco, Samsung, Nvidia, and Okta, and even, um, uh, the Brazil, Brazil's Ministry of Health

01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:19.600
as well.

01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:26.060
So no word if that's necessarily the right person that was responsible for all this,

01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:33.180
but, um, they did catch somebody who I think they, that their information also been docked

01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:33.420
out.

01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:35.100
Allegedly someone said they were high.

01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.980
I don't know, too much stuff going around, hard to know what to believe.

01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:42.300
Uh, but that is not the end of the hacks.

01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:48.380
So apparently take two, um, not having the best of luck, but, uh, according to a post

01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:52.700
on the official two K support Twitter, I think something is coming up later in the show on

01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:53.580
this actually.

01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:55.900
So we'll probably talk about that a little later.

01:53:56.860 --> 01:53:57.580
Okay.

01:53:57.580 --> 01:53:57.900
All right.

01:53:57.900 --> 01:53:59.100
Well then that's it.

01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:06.220
But the, um, uh, part about the hack and so forth with grand theft auto six, um, is very

01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:11.580
interesting, um, that the, the person that reported this is, is somebody I've known online

01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:16.300
for a long time, and they're very in tune with internet culture.

01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:20.540
Um, so it was very, very interesting to see, um, this all kind of come out.

01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:26.380
Uh, I, I'm very curious, like where, uh, that was all kind of figured out and how that was,

01:54:26.380 --> 01:54:30.140
uh, you know, this particular individual was responsible.

01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:34.940
I guess we'll see her more in the coming weeks as we start to see, uh, some of the, um, um,

01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:38.140
you know, court stuff that may come out of it.

01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:39.980
Yeah, we'll have to see, I guess.

01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:41.820
All right.

01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:47.660
Well, um, along similar lines, talking about, um, the rockstar and so forth, uh, and what

01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:53.260
they've been going through, uh, some developers have actually, uh, I want to say they're sort

01:54:53.260 --> 01:55:00.140
of showing support for rockstar by bagging on internet, internet, uh, tweeters and people

01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:04.140
that have really shit opinions, uh, with some of this stuff, actually aren't really dumb

01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:05.180
opinions, honestly.

01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:10.220
Like, seriously, it's just like these people, I guess, don't know how video game development

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:10.620
works.

01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:11.660
No, they don't.

01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:17.660
So for example, um, character artists, Xavier, uh, Cole, ho call Stoney.

01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:18.460
I hope I said that right.

01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:22.460
I'm sorry, but they are a character artists for ratchet and clank, rift apart, 3d.

01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:27.980
And they wrote a tweet that said, this is the greatest extremely confident, but has

01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:29.820
no idea what they're talking about.

01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:31.500
Take I've ever seen.

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:33.660
And it was in reply to a, it was a screen.

01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:35.340
Oh, I love that they did this right too.

01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:39.740
They screenshotted the tweet instead of quote, tweeting it to prevent the tweet from getting

01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:42.140
further engagement and the screenshot.

01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:45.180
And I'm not going to say who tweeted it because they don't deserve to have their account.

01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:51.100
Shout it out said, if you knew how game development goes, you'd know that visuals are one of the

01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:52.540
first things done.

01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:55.260
This game is four years into planning and development.

01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:58.540
What you see is almost exactly what you will get this.

01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:01.900
The next year is mission coding and debugging all backend stuff.

01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:09.180
It does look ass and that unleash the floodgates of this new man, since graphics are the first

01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:10.540
thing finished in a video game.

01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:16.700
And so the developers of control actually showed what control looked like early on with

01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:23.260
these giant boxes that said, throw me as part of what was the environment there.

01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:27.740
The naughty dog tweeted out what last of us look like in development.

01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:34.060
The cult of the lamb developers even tweeted out a screenshot with the meme graphics of

01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:37.580
the first things finished in a video game that showed what the video game looked like

01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:42.140
in a very early state where a lot of the graphics were very rough and not quite polished at

01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:42.940
that point.

01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:44.300
And so on and so on.

01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:52.060
Game developers around the world have come together to dunk on dumb ass tweets that pretend

01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:56.860
they know what goes into game development when in fact they know nothing about it.

01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:59.980
And that's a lot of Twitter opinions, unfortunately, we see in these day and age.

01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:01.820
So I'm glad this person is getting dunked on.

01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:03.980
Say something too.

01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:06.060
It's not just video game development.

01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:10.620
If I'm doing a graphic layout, I'm going to use a shitload of placeholders.

01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:14.620
I will use low res pictures to save on my work.

01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:19.420
When I'm working on video editing, I'll use what's called proxy media, where instead

01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:26.140
of using my very big, very slow 4K footage, I'm using like 720p placeholders.

01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:32.300
You know, it makes sense that when you are starting a layout, you do not start with your

01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:33.020
best stuff.

01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:36.860
You start by putting a foundation down.

01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:38.220
You start with your engine.

01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:39.580
You start with your play.

01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:41.100
You start with your physics.

01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:42.780
The graphics are going to come after.

01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:46.780
Every movie starts with a storyboard, right?

01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:50.940
And before a frame of footage is shot, even in my job when putting together, you know,

01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:54.060
things that have, because I do layouts with PowerPoints and the guides and so forth.

01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:57.900
I use a site similar to Shutterstock for like art.

01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:59.580
It's not that one, but it's a different one.

01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:06.300
And so what I'll actually do, I put in the art with the fricking, the watermark on it

01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:11.340
and everything ugly and so forth, just as a placeholder so that people can see this

01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:14.140
is the art that we're going to use if this is approved.

01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:18.140
And then once it's approved, then we pay for the art, get it in and put it all in there.

01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:20.460
So we're all clear with, you know, copyright and all that stuff.

01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:23.660
The art was done before you started that PowerPoint.

01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:24.780
No, it wasn't.

01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:28.460
No, I'm saying a low version was done while the content is being reviewed.

01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:31.260
But it was on Shutterstock, therefore it was done before.

01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:33.020
I said it wasn't Shutterstock, but sure.

01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:34.140
Or whatever.

01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:34.700
All right.

01:58:34.700 --> 01:58:35.100
Anyway.

01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:36.460
All right.

01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:39.820
And lots of people making other analogies in chat, but I think we all get it.

01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:42.780
This tweeter had no idea what they were talking about.

01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:49.020
I'm also going to say this too, is that when you're working in the art production side

01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:54.540
of it, you're not going to start with having a pretty finished model at all either.

01:58:54.540 --> 01:59:01.180
You're going to make your skeleton, you're going to have a rough blob model that you

01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:09.100
were going to mold into the shape and then fine tune, you know, your model.

01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:13.660
And this comes from someone who has done 3D modeling and ended up with a cat taking his

01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:14.700
shit by accident.

01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:23.180
Um, you're, it's one, it's all, you've got to build from, from a foundation.

01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:23.980
You've got a blank.

01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:26.380
No, you're fine.

01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:27.980
This is pet peeve.

01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:34.540
I wanted to see if this particular individual kind of doubled down on their comments or

01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:35.900
apologized for them.

01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:37.820
So I went to their Twitter account.

01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:38.460
It's locked.

01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:41.740
So anyway.

01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:44.460
They did the run and hide method.

01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:47.260
They fucked around and they found out.

01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:48.460
All right.

01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:50.620
Moving on next story.

01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:53.100
I think Dark Soccer, we're back to you.

01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:54.620
I can't with people.

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:55.980
I'm just saying right now.

01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:57.340
So how about something better?

01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:02.460
Um, y'all, y'all remember the nineties when we had Blockbuster?

02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:04.300
I try to forget, but sure.

02:00:04.300 --> 02:00:05.260
No, the nineties were awesome.

02:00:06.300 --> 02:00:08.540
Yeah, we had good music in the nineties.

02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:16.140
Um, anyway, though, uh, the Blockbuster World Video Game Championships is coming back.

02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:20.140
In fact, it's supposed to be back in October.

02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:22.620
So they have the one store?

02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:31.500
Well, no, let me, so the Blockbuster World Video Game Championship three is going to

02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:37.660
take place October 14th through 16th hosted by Portland Retro Gaming Expo and DoubleJump

02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:43.100
events, and they want to, basically it's free to enter.

02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:47.980
They just want to make some new memories, but they are teaming up with Blockbuster to

02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:53.100
recreate a video, the video rental store for the weekend.

02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:59.820
There is the Blockbuster experience room where they can pick up an updated Blockbuster card

02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:04.780
and meet the general manager for the last Blockbuster on the planet, Sandy Harding.

02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:11.180
Um, they have one store left, one store left.

02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:12.300
Yeah, and it's in Oregon.

02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:13.900
It's, it's not near Portland.

02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:16.700
It's in the Southeast part of Oregon, but it's, it's there.

02:01:17.340 --> 02:01:20.380
But the prizes are, I mean, they're okay.

02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:26.060
You get a $1,000 PRGE exhibitor hall shopping spree.

02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:30.940
Second and third place will respectively get $500 and $250.

02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:33.420
Um, there will be two rounds.

02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:38.940
Round one will go against each other in Saturn Bomberman, which is a very good version of

02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:39.500
Bomberman.

02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:43.580
Um, the first player to win three battles moves on to round two.

02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:49.900
Round two will be a high score on Downfall OG Plus for the Atari Jaguar.

02:01:51.100 --> 02:02:00.860
And then, um, and, uh, I, I mean, it's not a good Jaguar.

02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:01.340
Game.

02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:04.940
I'm just saying, but Saturn Bomberman is great.

02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:13.900
I, I, I wonder if any of these, uh, people actually are, have played Saturn Bomberman

02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:17.660
or have played a Bomberman question mark, maybe.

02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:27.100
Um, but I mean, there were the original, um, Blockbuster, uh, world championship.

02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:30.220
People would compete in these different stores across the US.

02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:36.140
And then the store champions who were the winners would go on to compete at Gamepro's

02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:37.820
headquarters in San Francisco.

02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:39.820
I know I competed in that, it was fun.

02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:43.900
Yeah, I think I did once.

02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:50.300
Was it NBA, NBA Jam and Ninja Turtles Tournament Fighters?

02:02:51.340 --> 02:02:51.660
Yeah.

02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:53.980
Now Turtles Tournament Fighters was the one I was good at.

02:02:53.980 --> 02:02:55.260
I suck at NBA Jam.

02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:57.740
Or was it, was it both games or was that two different?

02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:00.940
I thought it was, I want to say that it was both.

02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:05.980
It's, I, I, I don't remember.

02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:09.980
We always went to Hollywood video, so I don't.

02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:14.460
You know what I found very recently?

02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:17.100
I found my laminated Blockbuster card.

02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:23.820
The Blockbuster nostalgia is completely lost on me because they did something to piss my

02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:27.020
mom off because my mom was a movie buff.

02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:27.980
She loved movies.

02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:30.620
She loved obscure ass fucking foreign films.

02:03:30.620 --> 02:03:31.580
That was her favorite.

02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:35.260
And, um, she, but she hated Blockbuster.

02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:35.740
Like they did.

02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:40.460
I think she was mad at Blockbuster because Blockbuster required her to have a credit

02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:42.860
card and she's like, and this was just my mother.

02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:47.980
If you knew her, she was very much like, I'm not giving my credit card information to anyone.

02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:50.460
They can, they can suck it basically.

02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:56.620
So, um, but for whatever reason, I can't say and commit, you know, that that was the

02:03:56.620 --> 02:04:00.220
absolutely the reason, but all I know is that Blockbuster did something to piss her off.

02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:01.500
So we never went there.

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:06.940
It was always Hollywood video or her favorite, her favorite place to rent movies was the

02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:07.580
warehouse.

02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:11.100
For those that remember that it rented movies there.

02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:12.380
Oh yeah, they did.

02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:13.500
Yeah, they did.

02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:17.180
I don't, what were all, what with the warehouse was in with all these other brands too, but

02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:19.580
the warehouse was, yeah, they rented a lot of movies.

02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:23.900
It was a big, it was a big, um, tape and CD store.

02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:26.860
Two back in the, that's where I bought my first PlayStation two.

02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:32.860
When I would go visit granny and Dothan, Alabama, we would go rent from the Curtis Mathis.

02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:36.220
Who remembers Curtis Mathis?

02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:37.020
We didn't have him here.

02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:37.520
So no.

02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:43.260
Well, I mean, it was mostly to sell the electronics, but they had like a wall of movies and I saw

02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:49.420
some weird shit, but I think I rented return of the Jedi, like so many times, so many times.

02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:57.260
But we had, we had a few different like local rental places that would get like the really

02:04:57.260 --> 02:05:00.620
good nest games that I would rent from.

02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:03.820
And then I rented a turbo graphics from a couple of times.

02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:12.220
So I'm trying to do the quick poll of a YouTube or not YouTube Wikipedia to see what it is.

02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:19.100
Warehouse had purchased blockbuster music from Viacom at 1998, but I can't figure out,

02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:20.620
it doesn't say what the other stores were.

02:05:20.620 --> 02:05:24.460
I guess the warehouse was unique to California.

02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:27.820
I thought they were in with other birds until you mentioned it just now.

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:28.320
Yeah.

02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:33.420
So wasn't there like another one that was like the warehouse that was in the mall.

02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:35.260
I'm trying to think what that was now.

02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:37.660
It was like FYE, FYE, that type of thing.

02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:38.460
It wasn't FYE.

02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:39.500
I, yeah, I remember that.

02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:42.860
That was very much like the warehouse, but there was also another one that was smaller.

02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:48.060
So dark Sakura, do you know, and I apologize to the listeners for getting extremely local,

02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:49.900
but tangents, they happen.

02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:54.700
Do you know out in Roseville where the Mongolian barbecue is that a lot of people like in the

02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:59.260
TJ Maxx Plaza and there's the, there's the learn we used to go to.

02:05:59.260 --> 02:05:59.580
Yes.

02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:04.060
And there's the learning, the learning store, the Lake shore learning center, that place

02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:05.340
that used to be the warehouse.

02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:06.700
No.

02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:07.100
Okay.

02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:08.060
And that's yeah.

02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:12.620
Going way back, throwback for the record.

02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:14.060
One, one little tangent.

02:06:14.380 --> 02:06:14.880
Hmm.

02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:20.940
When I, when we saw Weird Al last night, he kept talking about tower records and I, but

02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:23.420
I was here to experience the tower records.

02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:28.540
They bulldozed the tower building here or not, not the, not the theater, but the record

02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:29.820
store across the street is gone.

02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:32.540
The one that used to be dimple then it, they know it's gone.

02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:33.420
They bulldozed it.

02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:34.860
I know.

02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:35.100
Right.

02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:36.140
That's like me.

02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:38.220
That isn't the original tower records.

02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:43.020
Cause technically the original, the original tower records is now tower cafe because tower

02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:46.620
cafes, indoor portion was a drug store and tower records started in the back of that

02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:47.420
drug store.

02:06:47.420 --> 02:06:51.100
So if you're eating at the back table in tower cafe, you're eating at the original tower

02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:51.820
records.

02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:59.900
But the watt location was the first actual retail full tower records location.

02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:01.260
And now it's a Goodwill.

02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:04.140
And they actually have the old tower signs still in the back of the Goodwill.

02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:09.100
So yeah, that I, that I remember I like go and that's a really good Goodwill as well.

02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:09.420
Yeah.

02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:12.460
Um, you know, the last time I went to the tower theater, I think it was with you to

02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:13.420
see the shape of water.

02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:14.700
Oh yeah.

02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:16.060
That was a few years ago.

02:07:16.060 --> 02:07:16.380
Wow.

02:07:16.380 --> 02:07:16.700
All right.

02:07:17.420 --> 02:07:20.460
Less tangents, more news, two hours, 10 minutes.

02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:22.540
We haven't even gotten to the classic game.

02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:23.420
Let's go.

02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:23.820
All right.

02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:25.180
Loki.

02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:26.780
Just do anything tonight.

02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:28.220
I'm just here for the ride.

02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:31.260
You're helping make the show long.

02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:33.260
So fine with that.

02:07:33.260 --> 02:07:35.420
You know, fewer Weskers.

02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:43.580
Uh, so we're back to talking about, um, this lawsuit between the destiny to cheat makers

02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:44.780
and bungee.

02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:50.060
Um, you may remember last time they were saying that the lawsuit was frivolous.

02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:54.380
That was of course, the claims that were made by aim junkies, which is a website, I guess

02:07:54.380 --> 02:07:57.900
it's owned by a group called a Phoenix digital group.

02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:06.780
Um, now they're claiming in a counter suit that bungee had access and downloaded files

02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:10.460
on the personal computer of the defendant, James May.

02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:21.980
Um, so basically saying that he was hacked by bungee, um, that also that bungee used

02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:25.580
the information obtained to conduct further surveillance on the group as well.

02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:33.260
So we'll see, um, hacked by bungee is going to be the name of my first album.

02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:38.220
I don't believe it, but we'll, we'll see what we'll see.

02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:41.820
It's an interesting, um, strategy.

02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:43.500
We'll have to see if it pays off.

02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:43.740
Yeah.

02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:48.860
We'll have to see, uh, we'll have to see what comes up in court with that whole situation.

02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:49.360
Huh?

02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:50.380
Yeah.

02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:50.860
All right.

02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:51.260
Yeah.

02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:51.580
All right.

02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:57.580
Well, uh, moving on, let's talk about, uh, a little more about those Atari recharged

02:08:57.580 --> 02:08:59.980
games I sort of referenced during my gaming week.

02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:03.340
So Atari recharged games, some of the ones that have already been released are going

02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:04.700
to get new content.

02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:09.100
Now, this article I'm looking at specifically speaks to the Nintendo switch, but a lot of

02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:10.940
these games are also on the PC.

02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:15.340
So I'm not sure at the PI, but I tried to search other news sites and I couldn't find

02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:20.540
the news if this was coming to switch as well, or I'm sorry, steam PC as well.

02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:22.060
But we do know it's coming to switch.

02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:28.460
So asteroids, centipede breakout, black widow, and gravatar, all those recharged versions

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:30.780
are going to be getting new content on the switch.

02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:37.100
It's bonus challenge levels that were previously only available on the Atari VCS.

02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:39.660
And that may be the reason why it's not completely in steam.

02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:40.140
I don't know.

02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:45.580
But they are a very high level of difficulty for these, and it will be new challenges for

02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:49.900
existing players and additional value to anyone who's getting the titles for the first

02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:51.740
time arcade mode.

02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:54.620
Oh, and this is exactly what dark Tetsuya was talking about earlier.

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:59.260
Arcade mode will now give you three lives instead of one, just like the coin op games

02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:00.060
they are based on.

02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:01.020
So that's fun.

02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:06.380
And a new arachnophobia mode is coming to black widow recharged, and that will turn

02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:08.460
the spider into a frosty snowman.

02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:12.220
And you're shooting snowflakes instead of webs.

02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:17.660
That's actually so like, it's not it literally is for people who have arachnophobia.

02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:24.620
You can change it away from spiders into, I guess, Sonic Christmas Nights, where now

02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:28.060
you're playing a Christmas themed game or whatever.

02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:29.020
So it's fun.

02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:31.820
All right, so that's neat.

02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:33.340
Look for that on the switch eShop.

02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:34.460
All right.

02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:39.660
Meanwhile, since I brought up Atari, I think it's a good time for us to talk about other

02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:42.140
classic games in this segment.

02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:45.340
Except I forgot my button pushing device doesn't work.

02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:49.740
So let me try that transition again and we'll go to this next segment.

02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:17.980
And here we have one of those games that I can't believe it's 10 years old.

02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:18.700
But here we are.

02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:21.260
Dark Sakura.

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:22.700
Skullgirls.

02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:31.340
Skullgirls is a 2D fighting game that was developed by Revenge Labs and published by

02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:32.300
Autumn Games.

02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:46.540
The game came out on April 10th, 2012, and it's pretty fun.

02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:53.580
The game was first released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live and was so positively

02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:57.500
received that it expanded, it got more characters, etc.

02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:06.780
So the premise of the game is that you will fight each other, either teams of one, two,

02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:09.260
or three characters and knock out your opponents.

02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:15.260
Whoever has the most cumulative health when the time runs out too, just like any fighting

02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:15.500
game.

02:12:16.860 --> 02:12:23.100
But the setting is about a skull heart, which is an artifact that grants wishes for women.

02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:30.300
If a wish with an impure soul uses a skull heart, she turns into a monster called a Skullgirl.

02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:40.540
And it's a pretty, pretty, pretty interesting game, although it did have some setbacks.

02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:49.900
Autumn Games in May 2012 was sued over allegations of fraud about an unreleased property, Def

02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:56.060
Jam Rapstar, which cut off some of Skullgirls financial support.

02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:59.420
They had to lay off the entire development team.

02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:05.900
The core team reformed as Lab Zero Games in November 2012.

02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:11.740
And after crowdfunding, they raised enough money to continue their work and they developed

02:13:11.740 --> 02:13:16.940
the Windows version released by Marvelous in August of 2013.

02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:23.900
And then Autumn Games severed their ties with Konami in December 2013.

02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:31.100
And so Konami requested to have the game removed from the PlayStation and Xbox storefronts.

02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:39.100
The game was re-released in 2014 as Skullgirls Encore, ported to PS4 and PC in 2015, where

02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:41.900
it was renamed as Skullgirls Second Encore.

02:13:42.620 --> 02:13:48.540
And then another version in the Japanese arcades and Vita came out.

02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:55.740
For the record, the arcade version is on a Taito type X squared system.

02:13:57.580 --> 02:14:04.460
But then we've had like the Switch version in October 2019, Xbox One and Xbox Series

02:14:04.460 --> 02:14:07.820
X releases are planned for this year.

02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:09.340
I don't know if they're already out.

02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:16.300
And then Skullgirls Mobile was developed by Hidden Variable Studios and released for iOS

02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:18.060
and Android in 2017.

02:14:18.860 --> 02:14:23.660
And it's all over the place.

02:14:26.620 --> 02:14:30.220
So there, of course, is some drama.

02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:37.660
Autumn Games and Hidden Variable Studios severed ties with Lab Zero Games after sexual harassment

02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:42.620
allegations raised against the lead designer and programmer Mike Zimon.

02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:46.220
And so they were dissolved.

02:14:46.220 --> 02:14:52.780
And then some of the former members created a new studio called Future Club, collaborating

02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:57.020
with Hidden Variable Studios for future content for a second Encore.

02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:08.540
So basically, the model for the engine was based off of Marvel versus Capcom 2, with

02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:14.620
several of their game mechanics, like the tag team combat, character assists, delayed

02:15:14.620 --> 02:15:16.300
hyper combos, etc.

02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:24.460
And you can play with different ratios very similarly to Capcom versus SNK 2, where you

02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:29.340
can select up to three fighters on the team, but your life and power is bound.

02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:43.580
So you'd have either a variety of characters with less power in life each, or you can just

02:15:43.580 --> 02:15:45.740
have your favorite, your champion.

02:15:47.020 --> 02:15:53.340
The game has story mode, arcade mode versus mode, training room, a tutorial mode, and

02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:56.300
online play using GGPO Network Library.

02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:06.060
It also, it had some different features that looked at system and balance issues, such

02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:07.900
as infinite combo detection.

02:16:09.580 --> 02:16:14.220
And then it offered protection against unblockable attacks.

02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:20.460
So, for example, when a person uses a low hitting move and a high hitting assist attack,

02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:29.420
they have ways of blocking that by giving a period of unblockable protection after successfully

02:16:29.420 --> 02:16:30.300
blocking an attack.

02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:39.420
So they were really just, you know, focused.

02:16:39.420 --> 02:16:42.060
They always had updates for it.

02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:47.660
They had different add-ons, like faster gameplay, the online training, like I said before, a

02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:58.220
stun meter, and they also had a local game mode called Typing of the Skullcurl, similarly

02:16:58.220 --> 02:16:59.740
to Typing of the Dead.

02:16:59.740 --> 02:17:08.540
And so the teams would generate meter and attacks based on their typing accuracy.

02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:15.580
It's fully voiced story modes, cross-platform play across the entire PlayStation family,

02:17:16.220 --> 02:17:22.380
Second Encore brought in different challenges where you have unique battle conditions, different

02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:31.180
trials, different combo challenges, an endless survival mode, different RPG progression

02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:33.820
tactics, customization, deck building.

02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:41.980
So as far as the characters go, you had initially eight playable characters.

02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:50.860
You had Felia Medici, who has a hair parasite named Samson, which we're seeing, well, we

02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:53.260
were seeing that play.

02:17:56.300 --> 02:18:08.620
There's a circus performer named Sara Bella, an anti-skull-bruel cyborg named Patricia

02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:17.180
Peacock Watson and Painwill, who we're seeing in there, Princess Parasoul Renoir, Nadia

02:18:17.180 --> 02:18:23.820
Fortune, and then Valentine, and then the shape-shifting demon called Double.

02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:30.540
And then after the Indiegogo crowdfunding, there were five new characters named Sienna

02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:39.020
Squiggly Cantiello, who is a zombie, along with Leviathan, an anti-skull-girl cyborg

02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:41.420
named Benjamin Big Band Birdland.

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:42.940
I think that's funny.

02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:50.460
A parasite called Eliza, a wrestler called Beowulf, and another anti-skull-girl android

02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:52.060
called Robo Fortune.

02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:55.820
A clone Ophelia named Fukua was added to the game later.

02:18:56.380 --> 02:19:02.220
She was there for an April Fool's Day joke, and then everyone wanted to keep her.

02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:05.500
There were more characters added for season one pass.

02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:14.460
The character Annie, Parasoul's sister Umbrella, Black Dahlia, and Skullgirl Marie.

02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:22.140
So it's been lauded so much.

02:19:22.140 --> 02:19:30.220
And I already talked about the drama earlier, so I'm not going to go too much more into

02:19:30.220 --> 02:19:33.180
that, but the game also...

02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:38.700
The publishers also talked about a fifth DLC, Fighter, other free content.

02:19:38.700 --> 02:19:42.220
They're still supporting this game like you would not believe.

02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:51.900
But for the music, the original album had 28 compositions done by Yamane Michiru.

02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:56.460
Vincent Diamante, Blaine McGurdy, and Brenton Cossack.

02:19:57.820 --> 02:20:03.900
And you can still buy the whole soundtrack, although if you did $10 to the Indiegogo campaign,

02:20:03.900 --> 02:20:07.900
you get a digital copy of the soundtrack, or if you did more, you get a physical release

02:20:07.900 --> 02:20:08.220
of it.

02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:18.060
And basically with Yamane, she contributed for work in the Castlevania series.

02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:24.780
And so they really wanted her in there, and they wanted a jazzy theme.

02:20:24.780 --> 02:20:31.020
In fact, you can even see that with the Showtime right at the beginning.

02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:36.460
And it's been very, very popular.

02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:47.100
The game received very, very high Metacritic scores, the lowest of them being a 71 for

02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:52.380
iOS, the highest being an 82 for PS3.

02:20:56.460 --> 02:21:00.700
Everyone's given them some pretty high-level ratings.

02:21:03.180 --> 02:21:08.860
It was the highest selling game on Xbox Live Arcade when it was released, and the third

02:21:08.860 --> 02:21:12.060
best selling on PlayStation Network for April 2012.

02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:14.940
In Japan, the game took off so well.

02:21:17.980 --> 02:21:27.660
It's been well-loved, and for a little bit of legacy information, 2019 Anime Expo, there

02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:36.780
was a webcomic published by Webtoon, and at EVO 2022, Skullgirls was added as a main event

02:21:36.780 --> 02:21:37.100
game.

02:21:38.140 --> 02:21:40.140
And that's it, Skullgirls.

02:21:40.940 --> 02:21:43.740
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Skullgirls.

02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:45.180
I love this game.

02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:46.860
Again, it's one of those things where it's like, really?

02:21:46.860 --> 02:21:48.700
This is already 10 years old?

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:49.260
Ouch.

02:21:49.260 --> 02:21:53.820
But then a lot of people are also saying, the graphics of this game hold up very well.

02:21:54.700 --> 02:22:00.860
And part of that is probably the support, but also it's a very well-drawn and put-together

02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:01.260
game.

02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:03.020
I was going to say, the hand-drawn stuff is what holds up.

02:22:03.020 --> 02:22:05.340
No one's surprised that Sonic Box succeeded at it.

02:22:05.340 --> 02:22:06.140
Yeah, yeah.

02:22:06.860 --> 02:22:08.860
All right, so awesome, awesome.

02:22:08.860 --> 02:22:12.060
Skullgirls is your classic game of the week.

02:22:12.060 --> 02:22:13.740
All right, we're going to move on.

02:22:13.740 --> 02:22:17.420
We have plenty more show to come, although we'll probably do a lot of these stories

02:22:17.420 --> 02:22:18.540
rapid-fire style.

02:22:18.540 --> 02:22:24.300
But I want to make sure we have time for any calls over in our green room, vognetwork.com

02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:27.820
slash discord, if you want to join our green room and possibly join us on the air for a

02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:28.620
discussion tonight.

02:22:29.180 --> 02:22:31.980
But we still have a little ways before we're going to get to those calls, because first,

02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:36.060
we need to get through rapid-fire news and talk about some other headlines quickly.

02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:36.620
So, Loki.

02:22:38.380 --> 02:22:40.460
So we got a tease of a tease.

02:22:40.460 --> 02:22:47.500
So there's a post by New York Comic-Con that says, join us for October 6th at 4 p.m.

02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:53.180
Eastern Time for the teaser trailer premiere of the Super Mario Brothers movie.

02:22:53.180 --> 02:22:55.740
Not the old one, the brand new one by Illumination.

02:22:56.380 --> 02:22:59.420
So we're going to get a trailer for that soon.

02:22:59.420 --> 02:23:05.500
I will be in a pressurized tube 30,000 feet above the Earth's surface at the time that

02:23:05.500 --> 02:23:09.180
this trailer drops, and I don't think there is any place I would rather be.

02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:19.660
Uh, and then, uh, we've also got news that Borderlands game, uh, spinoff Tiny Tina's

02:23:19.660 --> 02:23:21.980
Wonderland is now going to be a franchise.

02:23:22.540 --> 02:23:27.100
So they're going to spin it off because it did so well, which is great because we need

02:23:27.100 --> 02:23:28.300
more Borderlands type games.

02:23:28.300 --> 02:23:30.620
And I hear this one was good and I still haven't played it.

02:23:30.620 --> 02:23:35.580
I know, and I keep waiting for that deep sale, but I imagine by the time, you know, November

02:23:35.580 --> 02:23:36.860
is around the corner.

02:23:36.860 --> 02:23:39.980
And so by the time we get to November, this game will be 1999.

02:23:39.980 --> 02:23:41.820
So I'll probably finally pick it up.

02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:42.320
Probably.

02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:43.760
All right.

02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:44.860
Uh, there's soccer.

02:23:46.140 --> 02:23:51.180
Oh, um, the studio behind Dead Space is making an Iron Man game with Marvel.

02:23:51.740 --> 02:23:56.860
Um, that's Motive Studio and they're doing a single player, third person action game

02:23:56.860 --> 02:23:58.620
starring Iron Man.

02:23:59.500 --> 02:24:00.000
Yay.

02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:04.300
It was only, you know, very quietly confirmed on Twitter.

02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:06.460
I'm excited.

02:24:06.460 --> 02:24:07.020
Yeah.

02:24:07.020 --> 02:24:07.820
Yeah, it could be good.

02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:09.420
All right.

02:24:09.420 --> 02:24:15.820
And, uh, we do have some incoming quality of life updates for the Capcom Fighting Collection,

02:24:15.820 --> 02:24:20.940
uh, which, uh, or if it's me, it's the Puzzle Fighter II and some fighting games collection.

02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:25.580
But hey, uh, the quality of life update is hitting this week on Tuesday, September the

02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:26.140
27th.

02:24:26.860 --> 02:24:28.700
All the patch notes are not available yet.

02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:35.020
However, this is supposed to include viewable hit boxes, new gem colors for Puzzle Fighter.

02:24:35.020 --> 02:24:38.700
I think this is to address some colorblind issues and make the game more accessible.

02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:39.340
Yeah.

02:24:39.340 --> 02:24:42.860
And you can view your opponent's connection status, you know, for people that are, you

02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:44.780
know, trying to do like switching and all that stuff.

02:24:44.780 --> 02:24:46.860
So, uh, yeah, that's pretty cool.

02:24:46.860 --> 02:24:51.660
So, uh, the update is supposed to have more tweaks in addition as well, but, uh, we don't

02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:56.060
know exactly what they all are yet, but it is supposed to be a pretty big update coming

02:24:56.620 --> 02:24:57.260
very soon.

02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:04.220

but it doesn't matter because PA patrol is coming out and that's all it matters.

It's already a PA patrol game on stadia. Well, this is a grand Prix game. You know what

02:29:44.780 --> 02:29:48.780

a dating SIM that centers around tennis? It's a visual novel that centers around tennis.

02:30:30.300 --> 02:30:37.580
Awesome. Um, we also have coming out, uh, the labyrinth of Zangetsu in Japan,

30th, the legend of heroes trails from zero. Uh, we also have, um, Bayonetta gets a Japanese release.

02:31:05.260 --> 02:31:09.420
I think this is the rerelease of the first game because it was digital before when you bought

02:31:09.420 --> 02:31:13.100
Bayonetta two on the switch, you got a digital copy. So if you want a physical copy in advance

02:31:13.100 --> 02:31:19.820
of three, this is your chance coming out of Japan this week. Uh, and that is so FIFA 23. Of course,

02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:25.180
I can't neglect FIFA 23. That's the switch. Let me quickly check in on the PlayStation five

02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:30.620
that has Valkyrie Elysium coming out this week as it is everywhere else. I believe that legend of

02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:08.060
Pathfinder wrath of the righteous PAW Patrol grand pre sword art online demon throttle

02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:23.420
of super pets adventure of crypto and ACE. All right. I'd like to think that's all one title,

02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:31.100
but it's a visual novel. Yeah. It's all it's all together. All right. We're going to go through

02:32:31.100 --> 02:32:35.980
these last few stories here, and then I'm going to open up the green room. So vog network.com

02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:40.220
slash discord. If you want to call in tonight, join the green room. Otherwise we have a few

02:32:40.220 --> 02:32:43.340
more stories for you. I was going to say, we're going to rush through them. I don't want to rush

02:32:43.340 --> 02:32:48.460
this first one though. So Loki, tell us a little more about this. Yeah. So, uh, this is pretty

02:32:48.460 --> 02:32:57.500
cool. So Xbox has launched a new program called project amplify. It is to basically promote and

02:32:57.500 --> 02:33:08.540
amplify black voices and, um, developers of color to inspire them to make games. Um, so apparently

02:33:08.540 --> 02:33:14.380
there's, you know, lack of representation in the development community and they're just trying to

02:33:14.380 --> 02:33:23.900
promote, you know, developers to put stuff out on, um, Xbox. So they have a video series, um,

02:33:23.900 --> 02:33:30.780
under, uh, the project amplify name, uh, that's on the ID at Xbox YouTube channel. It's, um,

02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:38.860
like 16 episodes that highlights different game designers and they even have, um, different,

02:33:39.500 --> 02:33:45.180
it's not just developers. They also have like, you know, um, narrative directors, artists,

02:33:45.980 --> 02:33:53.340
software engineers, that type of stuff as well. Um, and this is all in, you know, kind of, uh,

02:33:53.340 --> 02:34:02.060
revolving around also a, uh, revolt summit, which is taking place from September 24th through 25th

02:34:02.060 --> 02:34:08.380
in Atlanta, Georgia. So it's cool. It's nice to see some of those, you know,

02:34:08.380 --> 02:34:15.020
actions and plans around, you know, um, trying to, you know, bring more diversity into gaming and

02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:19.820
game development and so forth. It's nice to see that plan and see it in action. It speaks a lot

02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:27.260
louder, I think than the typical, you know, social media text image, um, committing to do better.

02:34:27.260 --> 02:34:33.340
They're also going to have a panel too at that revolt summit as well. Um, so that's going to

02:34:33.340 --> 02:34:41.420
be there and then they've got, um, there's a page on their Xbox website, uh, xbox.com that talks

02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:48.060
about, it's like, um, different resources as well. So, you know, they have, um, you know, getting

02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:56.460
learning C sharp, um, getting started with unity, um, getting started with unreal engine

02:34:56.460 --> 02:35:03.020
game design, um, development process, narrative tools, art tools, et cetera. So it's, you know,

02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:09.180
all these different things to hopefully help promote, you know, more developers that come

02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:13.740
to the Xbox platform or just become developers in general. All right.

02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:19.420
Okay. Let's, uh, just we'll, we'll rapid fire these remaining stories. So dark Sakura.

02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:27.900
Oh, um, there is some drama going on with take two interactive. Their help desk was hacked.

02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:35.660
Um, and so they're, uh, the party that did so send a communication out to players with a malicious

02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:42.060
link. Um, they put out a warning about it, not to open any emails or click on links from 2k games

02:35:42.540 --> 02:35:48.700
support account. And they're encouraging people to reset their passwords stored in the browser,

02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:57.420
um, enable multi-factor authentication, uh, run an antivirus and, uh, check their account settings

02:35:57.420 --> 02:36:04.380
to see if forwarding rules have been added onto their email accounts. Um, they, uh, they have

02:36:04.380 --> 02:36:10.220
taken their support function offline while they investigate and try to correct the issue. Um,

02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:19.260
and, uh, this comes right after an extortion group, uh, lapis with a dollar sign, uh,

02:36:20.460 --> 02:36:25.900
uh, compromised, uh, rockstar games. Um, you know, again with the grand theft auto issue.

02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:34.460
So this seems that there's going a bunch. We'll see, but yeah, be careful for your 2k game stuff.

02:36:35.020 --> 02:36:39.500
Be careful what you click on in general, always exercise good judgment. And if an email sounds

02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:45.340
fishy, probably as it probably is. Yeah. And multi-factor authentication. I mean,

02:36:45.340 --> 02:36:52.300
it's not perfect branding. It's really strong. So pay very close attention to branding

02:36:53.020 --> 02:36:59.260
because they, or, and also the exact email addresses that things come from. Um,

02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:06.540
also you can, if anything looks suspicious, you can show headers and see where they routed from.

02:37:06.540 --> 02:37:15.420
All right. Let's move on Loki. All right. So, uh, I'm a big fan of video game donkey.

02:37:15.420 --> 02:37:21.100
He does some hilarious videos online and makes different like review stuff for video games.

02:37:21.100 --> 02:37:29.900
Well, now he is using his persona on YouTube and his following to help, uh, indie game,

02:37:30.860 --> 02:37:36.220
uh, studios publish their games. So he's actually starting a publishing label called big mode.

02:37:36.700 --> 02:37:47.020
And he's basically looking to partner with, um, you know, AAA quality indie games to try to

02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:53.260
promote their game content and get their game out there. So we'll have to see what exactly

02:37:53.260 --> 02:38:01.340
that turns into it's a lot easier to say than to do. I think this individual is going to find out.

02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:05.740
And, um, I, I know we're trying to abbreviate for time, but the one thing I had wanted to say on

02:38:05.740 --> 02:38:14.940
this is, um, quickly, you know, if this was Sony PlayStation leveraging Sony media to push the

02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:19.260
Sony products, which they do do sometimes, let's be real. A lot of these companies do that sort

02:38:19.260 --> 02:38:23.180
of thing. I think a lot of us will kind of look at that and go, well, that's shady because they're

02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:30.700
just pushing their own stuff. It's interesting that this individual sees this as the solution

02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:37.020
to put together a publishing arm, what they can promote their own stuff through.

02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:43.580
I'm just saying it's a little bit, I think there's a little bit, I don't know. I don't know if this

02:38:43.580 --> 02:38:47.660
is the smartest move to get into this, but I wish him luck. Um, but I think you're going to find

02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:53.180
with a lot of these indie lower budget titles, a lot of it is, uh, what, you know, like the

02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:59.580
trombone champ, what goes viral, what can be the it girl. What's the thing that, because you know

02:38:59.980 --> 02:39:06.380
what, I'm still convinced to this day, YYR's super multitasking is so deserving of its moment in the

02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:13.580
sun, but it just, it like anything else, it needs that moment to go viral, you know, and I can,

02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:17.660
I can hype that game till I'm blue in the face, but until it gets right in front of the right

02:39:17.660 --> 02:39:22.300
people, you know, it's, it's not any, there's, there's plenty of other good games I'm unaware

02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:26.700
of that probably need that moment. Anyway, I could say more, but I'm trying to move fast. So

02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:31.340
I will go right into the last story here, which is about the song list that has been released

02:39:31.340 --> 02:39:38.060
for a theater, them final bar. Yes. The song list was revealed. And, uh, I already have seen plenty

02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:45.020
of the punchlines in our discord about yes. Crazy chocobo from final fantasy 13, two is in there.

02:39:45.020 --> 02:39:48.780
Of course. I bet. I mean, of course it was going to be in there. They weren't going to cut songs

02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:54.540
like when they're doing like 400 songs, anything they've done a chart for, uh, in these games was

02:39:54.540 --> 02:39:59.900
going to be in the game. That's free content. Uh, it would be very easy to skip that song and never

02:39:59.900 --> 02:40:05.020
play it, which would be the right call. Cause it's not a great song. However, uh, when I was looking

02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:09.340
at the list of like, okay, final fantasy 14 content, I wanted to see what they added from

02:40:09.340 --> 02:40:14.460
fantasy 14 and they put some really sweet stuff from a shadowbringers in there. So, um, they did

02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:21.340
add some stuff. Um, yeah, so, uh, there's a lot and, uh, the, the bonus stuff from other square

02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:26.460
games, it looks like they have a pretty impressive lineup of songs from other square games as well.

02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:32.140
They're bringing in things from, um, uh, live alive is going to be in the game, which I thought

02:40:32.140 --> 02:40:37.420
was very interesting. They also are going to some of the, um, spinoff albums like the primals,

02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:43.740
uh, has a song in it from their CD, the scions and sinners arrangement album for Fava SE 14.

02:40:43.740 --> 02:40:49.020
But then you get into like the saga series, the world ends with you. We all knew near was going

02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:52.860
to have some pad. Yes. They're doing way to the world. That's the only one I needed to see here

02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:58.540
in there. Um, chrono, mana games, octopath traveler. I mean, this is really going to be

02:40:58.540 --> 02:41:05.580
like a square collection. The only square series that seems to be missing is kingdom hearts,

02:41:05.580 --> 02:41:10.060
but I'm going to assume that's understandable. Number one, you had the melody of mediocrity

02:41:10.060 --> 02:41:14.940
game that already came out that tried to change the theater, them formula and failed miserably,

02:41:14.940 --> 02:41:19.900
but you also have the Disney thing in there, which probably makes it a little more difficult.

02:41:19.900 --> 02:41:24.940
Um, so we, we may not see those unless they are the question mark titles that are still

02:41:24.940 --> 02:41:31.740
yet to be announced. But, uh, I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't hedge my bets on it. I would bet

02:41:31.740 --> 02:41:38.780
the question marks are probably up coming square titles. I bet, um, for spoken is going to be one

02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:43.820
of the games that has music that gets added into a theater of them. Although maybe that would be

02:41:43.820 --> 02:41:47.340
a little weird. Oh no. Cause the game's gonna be on PlayStation as well. So you don't even have the

02:41:47.340 --> 02:41:53.740
switch versus PlayStation issue there. So that's just, or five has he 16 at that point will be out.

02:41:53.740 --> 02:41:58.860
So it would make sense that a DLC pack would have the 16 music. Well, they also have that,

02:41:58.860 --> 02:42:05.820
uh, seven. What was that? Um, gosh, I don't remember the, the, uh, seven prequel thing.

02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:13.260
Yeah. Um, crisis core. Yeah. Crisis. I don't know if they're adding new music to the

02:42:13.260 --> 02:42:18.060
remake that they're doing fifth dream and chat says do simple and clean, then get the fuck out.

02:42:18.060 --> 02:42:22.620
But then you have to pay Utada money to do that. And you know, they have every right to

02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:28.540
money as well from that, you know, collaboration so forth. So the Japanese one, cause it's better.

02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:33.740
Well, ideally we could select either one, but I'm not, I'm not, I don't think simple and clean was

02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:38.140
even a melody of mediocrity probably because they didn't work out a deal with Utada. I don't think

02:42:38.140 --> 02:42:44.300
any of their songs are in it. I could be wrong. You're going to put anyone in there. Do kiss me.

02:42:44.300 --> 02:42:50.860
Goodbye. Cause, um, Angela Aki, I love her as Joe and her mat says, Rob is just throwing his

02:42:50.860 --> 02:42:55.660
bank account at this game for the complete pack. True. I will be buying the complete pack. I'm just

02:42:55.660 --> 02:43:00.060
still deciding if I want it on PlayStation or if I want it on switch, I think I'm going to end up

02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:06.060
getting it on switch. The portable element to play it on a plane is pretty enticing, but yeah,

02:43:06.060 --> 02:43:11.900
will I be dropping a hundred dollars on the Uber Edison? Yep. It's me. I'm the problem.

02:43:12.700 --> 02:43:17.500
All right, let's get to the list. That's not a problem because they're giving you content.

02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:21.580
Yeah, you're right. The content is there. There's a difference between a hundred dollar loop box

02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:25.740
where you don't know what's in it and a hundred dollars worth of content that they've outlined.

02:43:25.740 --> 02:43:30.300
It's basically a digital collector's edition is what that is. Honestly, there's like 400 songs

02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:33.660
in Final Fantasy 14. If they were like, we're going to loop box the remainder of the Final

02:43:33.660 --> 02:43:42.700
Fantasy 14 soundtrack, I'd be like, I'm part problem. All right, let's move on to the listener

02:43:42.700 --> 02:43:46.460
round table. We're going to start with our mailbag because I don't see anybody in the green room,

02:43:46.460 --> 02:43:51.340
but I will get to tweets here in a minute, but let's read this quickly. Yep. Participate

02:43:51.340 --> 02:43:57.340
at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us emails. Hello peoples. So I'm at home after dinner

02:43:57.340 --> 02:44:01.340
with my family and catching up on episodes of X-Play on G4, which I'm watching on my DVR because

02:44:01.340 --> 02:44:05.260
I subscribe to cable. Currently I'm watching an episode where they're doing a retrospective of

02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:09.500
the Xbox one versions of Madden. It's interesting to see the opinionists talk about a product that's

02:44:09.500 --> 02:44:13.500
gone stale over the past few years, but not interesting enough for me to watch the episodes

02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:18.940
of X-Play as they're released. I'm watching an episode from a month ago and advertisers on

02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:24.540
television pay a higher value on people who watch their ads when their ads are current. What could

02:44:24.540 --> 02:44:30.700
G4 do to get people to watch their cable content in a more current fashion? Esports. About the only

02:44:30.780 --> 02:44:35.340
thing keeping cable television afloat right now aside from house flipper shows that are

02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:41.340
on in the background as I'm getting my nails done is live sports. Why did Turner and ESPN pay 24

02:44:41.340 --> 02:44:48.860
billion for their rights to air NBA games? Why did CBS, NBC, Fox, and ESPN pay 39.6 billion for

02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:53.820
their rights to NFL games? Why are networks in Europe willing to pay 13.5 billion for Premier

02:44:53.820 --> 02:44:59.180
League football? Because people who watch sports tend to watch it live as it's happening, whether

02:44:59.180 --> 02:45:02.620
it's at home on the couch or at a bar with friends or in the background as you're making dinner,

02:45:02.620 --> 02:45:07.180
people tend to watch sports live as it's happening. G4 could do what other cable networks

02:45:07.180 --> 02:45:11.820
are doing by airing esports competitions live as they are happening. Yes, G4 does air esports

02:45:11.820 --> 02:45:16.220
competitions, but these competitions are not live as they're happening. Live does mean as they're

02:45:16.220 --> 02:45:21.660
happening for the record. Yes, these competitions are also available on Twitch, but G4 could air

02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:28.700
these competitions live as well. All it would take is G4's parent company Comcast to be willing to

02:45:28.780 --> 02:45:33.100
put forth a substantial investment in this platform and therein lies the problem. If you

02:45:33.100 --> 02:45:38.940
watch things on a DVR on Comcast Cable like I do, eventually you'll see a screensaver come up. Often

02:45:38.940 --> 02:45:43.980
these screensavers promote things that are available via Comcast. Currently one of the

02:45:43.980 --> 02:45:48.620
Comcast DVR screens promote their customers getting access to Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:54.620
Live Beta. Now is there anything on this particular screensaver promoting G4? No, despite the fact that

02:45:54.620 --> 02:46:01.180
it all would take is putting the G4 logo on the side of the screensaver. If Comcast is willing to

02:46:01.180 --> 02:46:04.860
put a single logo on one of their screensaver slides, what makes you think Comcast is willing

02:46:04.860 --> 02:46:09.900
to invest in anything having to do with G4? Take care of entertainment. Well, thank you for the

02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:14.860
email, Redertainment, and you do make some very good points. I think especially when you hit on

02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:19.820
the fact that one thing that compels people to watch television is live events. Sports is the

02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:25.980
biggest one, of course, but even reality TV like American Idol, when that show was a little more

02:46:25.980 --> 02:46:30.380
relevant, I think the reason why was because there was so much of that live element to it

02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:37.660
that really made it must-see TV, or the news is live and so forth, and still it makes local TV

02:46:37.660 --> 02:46:43.340
relevant and so forth. So I do think you hit on something there, but again, we had additional news

02:46:43.340 --> 02:46:49.020
about G4 this week. Now, Frost is leaving, who's the only one that's given them a truly viral

02:46:49.020 --> 02:46:54.380
moment. Kevin Pereira, I believe, is leaving now as well. So it's kind of like one of those,

02:46:54.380 --> 02:46:58.780
you know, it's too early to eulogize G4, you know, maybe something comes through with the

02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:06.700
cost-saving initiatives, but I just, I think when it comes to video game media, G4 is one of many

02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:12.140
participants in that conversation at this point. And that's the way I can put it, like, without

02:47:12.140 --> 02:47:17.820
making it sound like I'm dogging on G4, because I'm not, but it's just G4 has to compete with a

02:47:17.820 --> 02:47:23.900
lot of other people in the room now. And that wasn't the case, you know, 10, 15 years ago,

02:47:23.900 --> 02:47:28.300
when G4 was more of the traditional TV network, and that's all you had, because people didn't

02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:31.580
have the internet fast enough to create their own television. So.

02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:37.820
On top of that, with the eSports stuff, it's a good idea, but at the same time, I think that's

02:47:37.820 --> 02:47:43.900
already being broadcast on like ESPN. So I'm assuming that there's some sort of rights exchange

02:47:43.900 --> 02:47:48.940
that's going on there. They're not just doing it for the, out of the goodness of their heart. So

02:47:48.940 --> 02:47:55.340
I'm wondering if they can't purchase the rights to that because it's already been purchased.

02:47:55.340 --> 02:47:59.900
And not to mention, if they're going to cost save, they don't have the money to do it.

02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:07.500
All right, I'm going into some tweets real quick. The vast majority of the tweets we were tagged in

02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:12.620
last week, the vast majority had to do with Dark Sakura being on the Stadia Doshid show

02:48:13.180 --> 02:48:18.140
last week, just because they were tagging us and they have fans that were retweeting and

02:48:18.140 --> 02:48:21.420
hearting. And it seems like your appearance was really, really well received over there.

02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:26.380
All I noticed was it was a long listen, so I haven't listened yet, but maybe that's something

02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:31.260
for airline travel when I get around to it, because I did see the YouTube that was posted.

02:48:31.260 --> 02:48:37.180
But yeah, thanks to Stadia Doshid for the multiple shout outs and sounds like you had

02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:41.500
a really good time there and made some new fans over there at the Stadia Doshid show. Thanks.

02:48:41.580 --> 02:48:47.260
Absolutely had a fantastic time. I really enjoyed it. I would do it again in a heartbeat.

02:48:49.180 --> 02:48:53.900
I will say, I believe this tweet that came to us is from one of those people that came to us from

02:48:53.900 --> 02:48:59.180
the Stadia Doshid show who tweeted us. It's on Twitter, Dustin Arand. And if you want to tweet

02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:04.380
us, by the way, it's at OLR who said, hey, great show. I have some counters to some points. Number

02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:07.420
one, we don't accept those here, actually. I'm going to move on. No, of course, every gamer has

02:49:07.420 --> 02:49:11.260
a voice, so let's get to these. Number one, Ubisoft does have their own subscription on

02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:16.060
console and the cloud. It's called Ubisoft Plus, and it's free to try until October 10th.

02:49:17.660 --> 02:49:23.660
I forgot about that. I plumbed, but you know what? You have to install that. I shouldn't have forgot

02:49:23.660 --> 02:49:30.540
because you have to install that fricking shell to get Assassin's Creed Odyssey on the PC. I don't

02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:33.100
know if you know that, but with- I'm on a Mac.

02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:39.900
Well, I know you do the cloud stuff, but I'm playing because of Game Pass and Game Pass PC.

02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:45.340
It's not like the other games where it installs directly in Game Pass. You have to download the

02:49:45.340 --> 02:49:51.180
Ubi thing and Game Pass basically talks to the Ubi thing and enables it on your account that way,

02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:55.900
which is interesting. It used to be Uplay back in the day, but then yeah, like the

02:49:55.900 --> 02:50:02.300
Twitter user saying, Dustin is saying, it's the Ubisoft Plus thing now is what it is. But I forgot

02:50:02.300 --> 02:50:07.420
that it was also like a whole cloud subscription thing and you could get their whole library.

02:50:07.420 --> 02:50:14.540
So yeah, good point. Good point. And then as another G4 comment, as far as G4 and cable

02:50:14.540 --> 02:50:20.300
and leaks us to an article called Cable TV is the New Landline, which is kind of a point I was

02:50:20.300 --> 02:50:25.980
trying to make last week, an article from the New York Times, due to our own timeframe tonight,

02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:30.140
I'm not going to go through the article on air. I did read it off air when you first sent us the

02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:36.380
tweet and it was really reemphasizing a lot of things I kind of thought I was saying last week

02:50:36.380 --> 02:50:45.420
about yeah, cable TV is not going to be what it is now in another 20 years. And things change,

02:50:45.420 --> 02:50:52.380
technology changes. That's okay. You don't see as many people rocking satellite dishes as you

02:50:52.380 --> 02:50:59.100
used to, unless you live in a place that can't get service in any other manner. I realized-

02:50:59.660 --> 02:51:01.420
Stay tuned is irrelevant.

02:51:01.420 --> 02:51:09.020
If you're in Alaska, satellite is huge. And then Dustin says one more tweet that says,

02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:13.660
whoever mentioned Crypt of the NecroDancer on the show, I got that on sale a month ago and I've been

02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:18.620
addicted ever since. Got it for Switch too. Well, make sure you probably already know this if you're

02:51:18.620 --> 02:51:24.060
a Switch user, but make sure you look out for Cadence of Hyrule as well. It's the same fricking

02:51:24.060 --> 02:51:28.780
game from the same developers, but it's Zelda stuff. So even if you're not super into Zelda,

02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:32.940
which I don't think many gamers would say that, but I'm sure there's some out there,

02:51:33.980 --> 02:51:40.940
that was definitely worth a look would be Cadence of Hyrule if you are not already in that.

02:51:42.060 --> 02:51:47.900
All right. Awesome. So I don't see anybody in the green room and that is a-okay because we're right

02:51:47.900 --> 02:51:51.900
about nine o'clock anyway. I hope I wasn't discouraging people from calling in, but we'll

02:51:51.900 --> 02:51:59.660
try again next week over at vognetwork.com slash discord. If nothing else, join the discord,

02:51:59.660 --> 02:52:04.380
talk to us throughout the week, send us your comments, send us some other things you have

02:52:04.380 --> 02:52:08.700
to say, cause I love to read them throughout the week. So vognetwork.com slash discord. And of

02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:15.260
course the tweets are great too. Stadia fans and all gaming fans, twitter.com slash O-L-R for

02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:20.460
whatever tweets you may have for us. And I hope we can join on some other podcasts as well out

02:52:20.460 --> 02:52:24.780
there in the coming weeks. We love guesting on other shows, all of us. I'd love to have

02:52:26.300 --> 02:52:31.660
them on. I think it would be awesome. Ever since we went virtual, we haven't really had a lot of

02:52:31.660 --> 02:52:35.180
guests on the show. I think we have to figure out what the format for that looks like. So we're not

02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:40.860
asking somebody to commit three whole hours to be here, but yeah, I'm all for bringing lots of it.

02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:45.820
I think you and I know about Between Us, probably like at least 25 Twitch streamers we'd love to

02:52:45.820 --> 02:52:53.100
bring on this show, if not more. So yeah. I would be down for it. I still kind of want to do

02:52:53.100 --> 02:52:59.820
like my Dead by Daylight sort of themed one where interviews are conducted as a character.

02:52:59.820 --> 02:53:05.020
Yeah. I think it would be funny. Bobby in chat says lies you've had Shane several times,

02:53:05.020 --> 02:53:08.780
not for the whole show though. So yeah, we usually, and that's probably the way to do

02:53:08.780 --> 02:53:12.220
it with a guest is we invite them in to talk about the kickoff topic. And usually when I've

02:53:12.220 --> 02:53:17.180
had Shane on, or I think there was somebody else too in one episode, it's about the kickoff topic

02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:21.980
and so forth. So we can always kind of shape the show that way, but we'll talk about that

02:53:21.980 --> 02:53:25.260
another time. For now, we're going to wrap it up. Dark Soccer, I know you're about to head out

02:53:26.220 --> 02:53:29.820
and do your thing. Do you want to give us a final thought tonight before you head out?

02:53:30.620 --> 02:53:31.340
A Wesker.

02:53:33.660 --> 02:53:36.860
Well said. All right. Bye, Jamie. Have a good stream.

02:53:36.860 --> 02:53:37.980
Later taters.

02:53:37.980 --> 02:53:42.540
All right. And of course, I'm going to say as always, thank you for downloading and listening

02:53:42.540 --> 02:53:46.780
to Orange Lawns Radio, whether it was on the podcast feed or you were here live. I appreciate

02:53:46.780 --> 02:53:51.740
you being a part of the show. You can always leave us a nice five-star review on iTunes or Spotify,

02:53:51.740 --> 02:53:56.860
or wherever it is you found this podcast. Those reviews go an awful long way in those kind words.

02:53:56.860 --> 02:54:01.260
We want to grow our family here at Orange Lawns Radio and Vogue Network. We can only do that.

02:54:01.260 --> 02:54:06.060
They're bringing more people in here and spreading the word. So tell a friend or two about the show.

02:54:06.060 --> 02:54:09.740
Thank you so much to those of you that do. I don't say that enough. I do see that there

02:54:09.740 --> 02:54:13.100
are people that do that. I appreciate the shout outs. I appreciate the tweets.

02:54:13.100 --> 02:54:15.740
All of that stuff is great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for those that do that.

02:54:17.740 --> 02:54:21.660
That's it. Let's get final thoughts and get on out of here. Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:54:23.260 --> 02:54:28.060
Almost done with this bill. I can't wait. Probably another day or so and I'll have it done.

02:54:28.060 --> 02:54:34.700
And then a video this week for sure. It's been three weeks and I feel real bad about it. But

02:54:35.580 --> 02:54:41.260
you know, considering everything that was going on and then the size of the bill. Yeah,

02:54:41.260 --> 02:54:48.700
it's understandable. My final thought. I'm going to stream on my personal stream Monday and Friday.

02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:52.860
Maybe. Well, I can't do Wednesday because work situation, but maybe Thursday night. I'm still

02:54:52.860 --> 02:54:59.340
trying to figure out a good game to do Thursday night. I'm kind of on the fence between streaming

02:54:59.340 --> 02:55:04.140
those Atari recharge games. I might get a couple more of them and stream those. Bone Champ. Or

02:55:05.260 --> 02:55:08.940
well, yeah, there's always Trombone Champ. But I'm also thinking Splatoon three. I think I got

02:55:08.940 --> 02:55:11.820
to get on board with that eventually. I'm kind of waiting to hear if they've patched some of

02:55:11.820 --> 02:55:16.380
the communication issues, because that's the big thing that's been ticking me off about that. So

02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:20.140
it's not so I'm playing that. I don't know if it's any good, but he likes it. Is he getting

02:55:20.140 --> 02:55:24.940
disconnected? I think he's just been playing the single player. Oh, OK. Yeah, there is always that.

02:55:24.940 --> 02:55:31.740
I could always just play that. But I still I don't really want to reward Nintendo for their crappy

02:55:31.740 --> 02:55:35.580
online, but we'll see. We'll see. I otherwise have been hearing good things about the game.

02:55:35.580 --> 02:55:39.340
A lot of tweets about this flat fest this weekend. So we'll see. We'll see.

02:55:39.340 --> 02:55:41.900
Even less of an excuse now that we have to pay for it, you know?

02:55:41.900 --> 02:55:47.100
Yeah, right. All right. But that is it. Thank you so much. Thanks for listening to Orange

02:55:47.100 --> 02:55:51.260
Lounge Radio. Thank you so much for being here. We will see you next week. Have a wonderful week,
