Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
where every gamer has a voice.
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 929 of our
show for tonight, September the 11th of 2022.
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined each week here to talk about video games, gaming
culture, the gamer lifestyle with my friends, although sadly not Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers
tonight she has the night off, I'm just going to be real with everyone, it's been a week
trademark patent pending and so it's kind of a miracle that we're here doing a show
tonight but a nobody loves to miss two weeks of shows that's you know what's the secret
of doing a podcast for over 20 years make sure you stay regular right although I'm sure
everyone would have understood if we took another week off and I'm going to get into
why in a little bit we kind of push forward with tonight however Dark Sakura she is still
recovering from some under the weather stuff and it affects her voice so she's actually
not even doing really her personal streams she just is resting her voice and not talking
right now to make sure she fully recovers so obviously doing this show would be very
difficult in line with that vision so she has the night off so she can rest however
joining me tonight as he does usually do say hello to Loki hi Loki hello how are you doing
Loki I'm doing okay I guess yeah it's it's been a week for me and it's been a week for
you so my voice is a little off because I think many of you have already seen this on
like Twitter and social media I got COVID so I'm recovering and this you might be going
wait a minute didn't you already have COVID yeah I did about six or seven weeks ago I
already had COVID the first time so I had COVID for the second time and this time was
much worse it was very clearly a different variant because the symptoms were very very
different so if my voice does sound a little bit like like sultry smoker voice not that
I want to glamorize smoking here in the year 2022 but there was a time in my life when
I you know would go see the Rocky Horror Picture Show and smoke clothes behind the theater
I quit a long time ago thank you but my voice is getting back into that range right now
so if my voice does sound off that's what's going on so it's both Dark Sakura and I dealing
with illness issues but I I feel well enough voice wise to do the show and I'm also kind
of like I kind of I need to do OLR like after this week I've I've literally gotten to do
nothing I enjoy this entire week Dragon Con was great and I'll get into that in a minute
but I've gotten to do nothing I enjoy this week I always come back from Dragon Con extremely
motivated to make content and do stuff and this COVID put the brakes on all of that so
that's kind of been a bummer so I'm really glad to be back here doing OLR with you and
thank you for the kind words over at twitch.tv slash vog network because we do tape live
every Sunday night at nine o'clock eastern six o'clock pacific right after the Bobby
Black Wolf show at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network that's vog network
and you can comment along with the show first off I want to acknowledge there's a hype train
going on in chat right now thank you so much for that you guys don't have to support like
that but you do and just I want to say I really appreciate that we will read all of those
donations at the end of tonight's show after we're done I'm recording the podcast because
this is also a podcast of course that you can get an iTunes Spotify you know all the
all the places that most people listen to podcasts some of the comments in chat my deaf
says you sound a bit off but not bad thank you dark to see it says yeah I notice it but
yeah it's fine yeah so I do I want people to know if my voice sounds different tonight
it's not like something in the podcast or it's just the fact that I'm recovering from
from COVID again um Loki you've also had quite a bit of a week I want to give you the space
to talk we will talk about video games uh and I know video games probably for both of
us have been a great and needed distraction this entire week um but I want to give you
some space to talk about your week as well Loki if you want to tell us better let's talk
about my week so um let's see so last Sunday um my mom passed away so she had like like
when I picture like the worst case scenario as far as like how I look at my life as far
as like uh work sucks you know then you retire and then like then um you know you have that
time to like do whatever you want well so basically she retired last year and you know
she was looking to enjoy her retirement uh come around New Year's I think it's like shortly
after the first like shortly around New Year's time she got a minor stroke so obviously there
is something going on um so it wasn't too impactful she like lost a tiny bit of her
vision but for the most part was just normal um then they were trying to investigate like
some heart valve issue that she had um that they thought might have been causing the leaking like
causing clots because it was leaking or something like that um in March she had a full-blown stroke
which caused her um to lose more vision to lose the ability to speak clearly I guess it's basically
here speech center so the best you could do was like one or two words and a lot of times those
words would be the wrong words coming out um she could understand just fine but she couldn't like
really talk clearly and it was also like very very mumbly you know very quiet like strained almost to
talk um so then they kept pushing back her heart surgery because she obviously had the strokes and
they have her on blood thinners and like we're getting all that so in July she finally has her
valve replacement surgery and everything seemed like okay we're gonna finally address the source
of the clotting oh and also before that they had she had like fibroids that they thought may have
been cancerous but they weren't able to kind of like tell if they were or not there it was
inconclusive if it was or not um so that was another thing that she would have had to have
a hysterectomy to address that as well as they were assuming that it was cancerous but they
weren't sure so anyways valve replacement surgery she's in the ICU for a while and it doesn't seem
to be she's having clotting issues now so she's losing blood flow to her hands and her feet and
tissues starting to die so like her fingertips are starting to go black and wither away her
toes are starting to do that as well so come to find out originally they thought it was an allergic
reaction to heparin which is a blood thinner but after doing different tests and after like
basically trying to treat everything they can they came up with the diagnosis that it's catastrophic
APS syndrome or anti let me pronounce this here antiphospholipid syndrome which is basically a
catastrophic means it's it's horrible it's very rare to have it that strong it's like one in
a hundred thousand or something like that and it's basically the immune system mistakenly attacks
the proteins in the blood causing clots everywhere so she was basically clotting her veins her
arteries organs everything which is extremely painful for her you know extremities and all
that stuff so fast forward now to gosh it was two weeks ago Monday so the beginning yeah the
beginning of the week from Sunday when she passed so Monday we had a meeting with the doctors and
the whole like nursing team and they basically said there's nothing we can do for her she's
dying so the start off the week I had to tell her because they aren't gonna do it I had to tell her
that she's dying so that was fun to have a conversation with somebody to let her down she
knew she knew what was going on you know obviously she was worried the entire time she wanted to go
home she didn't want to be you thought she was in the ICU for I think three to four weeks so which
is coming out of surgery you're supposed to be there for a couple days and that's it so clearly
knew what that something wasn't up and mean during that time it's possible like she was sleeping a
lot it's possible that she could have had other strokes we don't know but anyways she finally got
released into hospice care which is basically end-of-life care to us so we had her she was sent
to her home to basically pass away to die so we brought her home on Thursday and then she was you
know it look she was still with it like on Friday and stuff like that and you know able to
communicate it seemed like you know she was comfortable and everything but it just it
progressed pretty fast you know we weren't able to you know keep her as comfortable we kept having
the up the morphine and stuff thankfully though because of them it's a horrible syndrome to die
from incredibly painful I can only imagine how scared she was but she was really out of it with
the Ativan and morphine that they were giving her or we were giving her so thankfully I don't think
she was really lucid but yeah so she passed away Sunday morning ironically enough my in-laws were
coming to visit and when I first got there Sunday morning I could tell like I could hear her
breathing she had the they called the rattles it's basically you lose the ability to swallow
and it's kind of like snoring I guess sort of it's horrible sounding but she was like very loud
when I got there and then like I remember like as the morning went on I was like yeah she seems to
be getting quieter now like I don't know maybe she's starting to pass or whatever and so I had
checked on her and she was I mean at that point she wasn't waking like opening her eyes at all
anymore for like the last 12 hours or whatever and then so by the time my in-laws came to visit
when we went back to the room she had passed already so very sad you know it's it wasn't as
hard like honestly to see her like pass away it's just knowing how much she suffered for the last
like gosh months so it was kind of a relief yeah that but yeah it sucks there's there's a lot
there's a lot of parallels from you know what I went through five years ago as well so I'm not
saying that in a way to make it about me but I'm saying that in a way where it's like I I can really
relate to like you know a lot of what I'm hearing and and so forth and just you know I encourage
you to look at chat right now there's a lot of love from a lot of people in our chat room right
now sending their regards and well-races and you're you're absolutely on you're absolutely
right about a couple things one she already knew she was gonna pass away like you weren't right
you weren't really breaking that news you were just probably giving her confidence in what she
already knew and you're you're right she's no longer having to suffer or anything so all the
decisions you all made were correct and it was tough like because we had to go visit her in the
hospital like we divide our time between myself and my sister to go visit her each day in the
hospital and it's just it's hard to see her like that it's just constantly like she's you know
looking at her fingers who I mean at the very least they thought okay you know if they can get
the clotting under control it may be that she loses her fingertips but she's able to you know
live a normal life and and it honestly if that's all it was it I mean it sounds horrible because
they're like even like I'm like do you have to amputate that oh no I'll just fall off like an
umbilical cord I'm like that's horrifying but they like if that's all it was because it was
under her non-dominant hand too that wouldn't be so bad I mean that would suck but it wouldn't be
so bad but yeah it was just unfortunate it sucks because like you know I'm looking forward to
retirement because I hate my job so it's like this is this is a potential outcome that sucks
well it it emphasizes also the very important this is why we have to do things now you know
we have to enjoy all the time that we have now because even getting to 65 and retirement is
never guaranteed yeah yeah it was only 67 is what yeah she wasn't so yeah yeah it's hard to
say I mean you never know you'd be like you can plan for an amazing retirement you still want to
take full advantage of your 30s 40s 50s and so on don't be a workaholic and not take advantage
of those fun things now of course yeah don't kill yourself over your job yeah uh but yeah it's it's
it's sad but at the same time it's like it's I mean I was expecting this outcome right weeks
ago so it wasn't wasn't unknown and like even like during like last week in this week it's just been
like trying to just get back to normal as quickly as possible just not worry about not focus on it
too much you know it's so it's it's been for the most part pretty okay well I haven't been too
upset about it but yeah it's hard to talk about every now and then but I mean at least she's not
suffering anymore so there's that well well thank you for sharing Loki I know I know it's a
difficult story to share but I think there's a lot you know I definitely identify with a lot of what
you're sharing and I think there's a lot of people in chat that this is hitting home for I think a
lot of us too many of us in the past few years have joined the lost parent or parents club and
there's a lot a lot a lot of hugs going around and chat and the family for you so yeah now we're
so worried about our grand my grandfather because he's 96 mm-hmm oh it's like yeah that's a matter
of time like cuz yeah she had lost her mom literally last year like almost a year you
know ago so yeah that was hard for her too and it's gotta be I can only imagine when he's going
through to losing his wife and then losing his daughter like that yeah I can't imagine well you
know in in big world news this week of course we know the Queen passed away and she was 96 you
know and there's a lot of kind of III obviously there her being a big political figure there's a
lot of takes all over this it which is interesting because she actually has nothing to do with
politics as I understand it she's more of a figurehead but there's way too many opinions
on a British monarch in America which is strange to me but I I'm gonna digress it's one of those
things where I think a lot of people kind of look at that and go well I mean she's she's 96
let her go quietly and without all this pomp and circumstance and the big deal that people are
making it out to be but I get that she's a different you know type of figure 96 is still
an incredible run you know and people are making all of these comparisons to oh she you know she
was around for this and this and this that happened at the toy she's she's as old as sliced
bread and all the same stuff they were saying about Betty White over here who was basically
the Queen of America so you know it's um you know 96 is an incredible run but my grandma made it to
99 so you know there might still be a few a few years to go and so many many get past 100 even
so yeah yep um so I guess speaking of enjoying things in the moment and doing things while you
can let's talk about my week two so I went to Dragon Con and that's why I missed last show I've
been going to Dragon Con for the past God since 20 2013 was my first Dragon Con so this would have
been basically my ninth because technically 2020 I don't count that one yes I know there was a
virtual year and many people still count that for their streak I don't this was the ninth year for
me so I would say nine Dragon Cons and one virtual Dragon Con so I went and I had a great honestly
I had a really good time this year the panels I got to host I had some really good ones and some
really good experiences Loki I got to do that Red Dead Redemption actors panel which is important
because they're not voice actors and everything in the promo said they were voice actors they
were voice and performance so they're really performance actors and we actually talked a
little bit about at the panel about kind of the difference and that's not it was never a discussion
about minimizing the importance of voice actors just pointing out that they're different art
forms right just like you can you can paint with watercolor you can paint with oil right it's it's
just different ways of making art so we talked a lot about the performance capture element of it
and kind of what made that difference over so they were they were a good group I was really happy and
honored to do that panel it was a Monday morning panel so it was not super well attended for a
ballroom panel but it still had a really good crowd there was somebody that came all the way
from China that asked a question and I was like wow that's pretty impressive so yeah it was um
it was a good panel I got to do on the video game track some discussions on diversity in games and
microtransactions in games sadly those panels weren't recorded so I don't think you'll see
them anywhere but they were they were a lot of fun to participate in and some really really good
points and things brought up I got to do a couple panels on the digital media track I got to do one
about streaming when you're over 40 years old and what was interesting about that that was an
interesting panel because we had some very very big name podcasters on that panel the macarons a
couple of the people from the family and they do my brother my brother and me I think is the name
of their big one and they have another big one that's D&D I think it's the whole family playing
D&D together some of that I I don't listen to a lot of stuff because I don't want to be influenced
the only shows I really listen to anymore are shows by drag queens and I can say the macarons
are not drag queens so they're just not in my wheelhouse for things I listen to because you
know there's a there's too many and B I don't want to be accidentally influenced or steal from
another show but I I know these folks have a huge following that room was completely full and they
had people outside in the hall watching the streaming together while it was streaming out
of the room because the room could only hold like maybe 80 people so it was very interesting to do a
panel for other people's fans but I thought it was a good discussion and I thought Bobby did a really
good job moderating it and I thought and I will say the macarons were you could very easily be a
diva in a situation like that and they absolutely weren't they shared the space equally with the
rest of us that were on the panel and I just I really appreciate that and that says speaks to a
very high level of professionalism from them one of them used to be with joystick the blog years
ago so they know gaming and I think they they know Bobby from different circles and maybe me I don't
know but yeah yeah Bobby says it was technically vogs panel Bobby Bobby Bobby yeah we were the
ones who submitted it but nobody was there to see us well maybe I got actually people did try to
come to see us because I did hear from several people that just didn't realize they would have
to get to that panel an hour beforehand to see us so not to say nobody was gonna but just really
underestimated the star power I guess that was on that panel so yeah technically it was submitted
by us but it was fun I it was a good panel it was recorded so you will be able to see that on
YouTube in a couple weeks when they put that online it's on their twitch channel as well I did
another panel which was about I don't remember in the moment what was it oh it was the it was the
video to it was the audio to video one that I that vog has done in years past but this year
somebody else did it and Bobby and I were just kind of experts on that panel or whatever you
want to call it that was a good panel to sadly I oh no that one was recorded so I'll be on YouTube
as well sorry sometimes it's hard to keep track what isn't what isn't recorded and then I got to
do a panel on the horror track I know that one was not recorded in any way there's only a few pictures
out there of that but that was one on horror no respect and that was a lot of fun and I was really
jazzed to get to do a panel on the horror track this year with more of the hosting stuff that I
do on the side growing and so forth so that was all great so yeah I met a lot of great people
professionally an incredible dragon con professionally an incredible dragon con and I
really see I I'm I don't want to say too much because I don't want to jinx anything but it
looks like 2023 may be an even bigger and better year and that is really really exciting and I'm
gonna cross my fingers and toes for all that stuff but then you know I was staying with Bobby
Black Wolf at Black Wolf Manor and Mrs. Black Wolf I was staying there Monday night I used to fly home
on Monday night Labor Day but then we kind of made it a tradition I think the first year was maybe
2018 I think that I actually went and I stayed at Bobby's place and it's just it's a nice way to
decompress I got to see their house I get to you know he has that very nice theater sometimes we'll
watch a movie or I'll play a game or you know I think we were watching a little bit of twitch
this year because I think Alan was broadcasting a little bit so we watched him on the the big
screen and you know he has his arcade and I'll talk a little bit about that and all that stuff
so it just you know it's just so it's a nice way to like decompress after the con and then get on
the flight on Tuesday which is the way to do it and because the airport's a lot less fucky on
Tuesday too that's the other important thing and the flights are a little bit cheaper so all that
stuff is very cool Tuesday morning I wake up and I have a pretty bad sore throat and I'm like uh-oh
uh-oh but I'm thinking well this can't be COVID because I just had COVID seven weeks ago like I
should have antibodies for at least two months I'm I'm good and this is probably you know what
I've been taken in the air it's different here it's probably a little bit of concrete because
I was around a bunch of people even though I was masked when I wasn't on a panel I wore my mask
more than most people did and so forth I'm like it's just it's whatever it's just a little thing
I caught picked up whatever and I guess I probably could have taken a test but at the same time what
would that have done I was not going to impose on Bobby Blackwolf and Mrs Blackwolf to stay at
their house for an additional 10 days and I was not you know really prepared for that sort of
thing um and I didn't have any reason to really think it was COVID so I and I had to get to the
airport because my flight was going to be leaving so I went to the airport and I flew home and as
the day went on my day was getting a lot worse and I started to feel sicker and sicker and sicker
and when I got home I immediately took I'm sorry for the um noise that went through in the
background there I thought I had my alerts turned off uh sorry about that that is not you it is me
um I was getting sicker sicker so I took a test and I got home and bam it's COVID and it's it's
like the last time I had it I had just like a breath of fate a hint of a line but it was a line
this time solid red you're fucked line just shows up on the test so I was like great I just flew
home and exposed how many people to COVID but here's the thing can I sit around and feel guilty
all day about that no I wore my mask very well the entire way home because I knew if nothing else I
probably had con crud and so forth so I'm like you know what I'm gonna wear my mask diligently
I maybe took it off twice for five seconds to take us a down water and shove a handful of
pretzels in my mouth and that was it now did the people around me wear masks on the flight no
nobody nobody there comes a point where I can't be responsible for other people
that know the risk and so forth I did everything I could whether I had COVID or not
um speaking of precautions and all of that I I'm not I'm definitely not
mad at dragon con or any of that because that would be messed up I'm a big boy and I know
that I was going to a convention that was going to be attended by many many people and that there
would be a risk of COVID I thought falsely that my recent COVID would have given me extra protection
but even going into it I knew well weird things happen people can still get it and very clearly
I got some other type of variant so I'm a I'm a big boy and I own the fact that I knew the risk
I went into this situation I'm not mad at anyone for the fact that I have COVID but but me however
I was disappointed that the masking policy and adherence was nothing like it was in 2021
in 2021 dragon con man everybody wore their masks and it was you know you people kept it on the
whole time the masking was very good everyone did their thing this year it all fell apart and
I would say in the hallways and walking around the convention maybe somewhere between 20 and 25 of
the people were wearing masks and in the panel rooms maybe a little more because uh people would
some of the door people going into some of the tracks and events were reminding people to put
their mask on and maybe something a little bit more about the enclosed spaces I don't know I
could theorize the whole day but the masking was not what it was in 2021 however my understanding
is dragon con put out their masking policy only to be followed up by the cdc a week later who the
cdc now comes in and says masking is optional so everybody comes to dragon con and wants to start
pitching a fit and they start pointing at the cdc thing and go but the cdc says masking is optional
volunteers of dragon con get sick of this fight after having to do it so many times
I don't blame the volunteers for dragon con for giving up at some point the people that are temps
working at the hotel also decide to stop giving up this fight because the hotels basically decide
why should we be the bad guy why should the Hyatt the Hilton the Marriott why should we be the bad
guy when dragon con can be the bad guy it's their policy so they give up enforcing it at some point
it all fell apart because literally everybody gave up and I still believe something I said
from the very beginning precautions work they worked in 2021 they worked at games done quick
and those stories you hear from Bobby Blackwolf they didn't work here because there were no
precautions taken and that is the fault of the dragon con attendees so shame on y'all
you messed up but the reality is is this dragon con is this something unique to dragon con is
this dragon con's fault is dragon con a super spreader event no and if you're one of those
people on twitter or you're on social media that's sitting there going well people that
went to dragon con they should they should know better they they were going to a super spreader
event they're gonna go home and they're gonna get their family sick and they should feel bad
these people going to dragon con you're stupid if you're going to dragon con I have two words for
you fuck off and I'm gonna tell you something that's very ugly but you need to hear it you're
on twitter talking to random people because you don't have friends in real life that you can talk
to because you've pushed them all away with your shitty fuck attitude I'm telling you that because
I care and that type of behavior on social media where you're literally taking pleasure in people
getting sick needs to stop shut the fuck up now some people are going to feel very attacked by
what I just said and I want to be very clear on something I am very I am only speaking to those
people that go on to twitter and start to yell all of this stuff at people because they're taking a
risk and they're taking a choice and they know and going into these situations hosting and all
of this stuff that I do and leading panels and moderating and all this stuff this is my job
it's not my day job but it's my night job and sometimes I don't like to talk about it but
sometimes it's a paid job stop attacking me for doing things I need to do for my job
I knew the risks I weighed the risks and I went into the situation now back to my earlier point
or actually no I want to make sure I clarify this too because otherwise people are gonna
get their panties and wad because they're gonna take what I said out of context
if you are choosing to sit home because you don't feel safe at dragon con or any of this other stuff
I support you that's your right go do it do what you need to do you know I I understand
this is why we still have a lot of virtual things that are available this is why
zoom is so much more a part of our culture now than it was a few years ago and so forth
you have the absolute right to make that choice and do what you need to do for yourself I support
that so please if you're in that crowd do not mistake what I just said which is again people
attacking others for doing what they need to do that's not the same thing I want to make sure
that is very very clear I respect anyone who didn't go to dragon con because they just felt
a risk they wanted to take that's fine
the reason why I say is it dragon con's fault is dragon con a super spreader event and all
this stuff and I say no is because let's be real if I hadn't gotten this at dragon con
because I didn't the first time I would have got it somewhere else like I did the first time
I would have got it at a restaurant I would have got it at work I would have got it at Costco
I would have got it at the grocery store I would have got it at the movies I would have got it
walking going on walks at the gym I would have got it into at one of hundreds of other places
because society has decided we're done with precautions and precautions work but without
precautions nothing works anymore that is society's fault not dragon cons dragon
con's just one part of society so I I so do I regret going to dragon con absolutely not
I'm disappointed and frustrated that a the the masking and all that stuff because again you can
say you can believe I can still say all of this that people should be able to take risk and go
into these situations do what they need to do for their jobs their careers their mental health
let people make that way decision and whatever they need to do I can say all that that is not
an anti-masking stance because I can say that and I can also say but we should still take precautions
like getting vaccinated wear your mask and do everything you need to do both of those things
in my head are true so that's that's what it is and unfortunately though the the cloth over people's
face has proven to be too much after two years and uh it is what it is it is what it is that's
that's society's problem to figure out why we we can't bring ourselves to do that after a few years
so uh getting some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network s2100 matt says people
need to understand that many folks are taking risks into their hands it's their choice and they
have their reasons mental health is a big reason many folks want to enjoy life the best way they
can in this situation yeah exactly exactly and you know what I know a lot of people that saw
lady gaga either this weekend within the week or last week you know how many people were at those
concerts more than were at dragon con now granted it was outdoors but you see how tight all those
people are sitting together it's a it's a risk and what and the reason why I said what I said
and I was really nasty to people that need to hear something nasty because their behavior it's
just a reflection of their behavior right now because there are so many of those people that
are attacking people on twitter making certain decisions and so all this stuff there are so many
people that say that stuff and then turn around and justify but I'm gonna I need to do this one
thing that's the behavior that pisses me off is that people will blame dragon con attendees
but then talk about their twitch con plans or their anime con plans or their packs plans or
whatever it is or their concert they're gonna go to or I can't miss this particular thing or
I've got this big family birthday party coming up or whatever it is like the hypocrisy smells it's
so bad anyway DJ Ramez says people also forget one thing we are still in a pandemic yes true
she-hulk 10 says it's scary especially long COVID absolutely and it sucks and I hope some of these
symptoms I'm not going to have for a long time but again this was something that is because of
the way society is right now in every place I was probably going to get it eventually well I did I
did and I did I did get it one time already the only thing that really sucks is the fact that I
know now that Alan got it too and at least you don't have kids because that's a whole other
entry vector oh god don't you want to talk about another thing but anyway great point
excuse me I will try to mute myself and not cough into the mic but I'm sure you all understand it
may happen tonight I got Alan sick we tried our best to distance at home stay apart and so forth
and of course I feel bad of course I don't I don't like that this has happened but Alan's
you know in in his typical graceful wonderful way has said you know what it's been 30 months
this is going to happen eventually and he has a very similar outlook I do if it didn't happen now
it was going to happen like you got it before and I didn't or you know when it was restaurant or the
gym or something else like this has got it was going to happen eventually so uh she-hulk 10
in chat says hopefully it will weaken like the flu and die out soon that's it it does seem to be
the way it's going I am not a scientist I can say what I had this last week sucked
it was bad it was worse than a cold it was worse than a sinus infection but it wasn't as bad as
swine flu I will say that so you might remember that was the thing that we here at OLRL got to
deal with about 10 years ago I know if longer than that probably 12 years it wasn't as bad
as swine flu in my opinion but it was up there all right um anyway I know I've said a lot and
like none of it has been about games but I think it was important to say and um you know if I if
I made you angry with something I said I just I just want you to stop and think about some of the
things that you say and you put out on social media and so forth and put yourself in other
people's shoes and again you have the right to make your own decisions on what is best for you
that is 100 understandable it is not okay for you to attack other people blame other people
or make people feel guilty because we're doing the things we need to do to keep our lives in
wellness and running and in good state getting covid is not a moral failing repeated after me
getting covid is not a moral failing
society our leaders had a chance to minimize and reduce this two years ago in 2012 really in 2019
and gone into 2020 we as a society and the leaders that lead us failed to do that we are now all
paying the price so if you want to blame something blame that uh looking at chat over at twitch.tv
slash vog network uh bobby blackwell says I respect everyone's risk tolerance and will no
longer try to pressure even if it's mock pressure people to come to conventions with vog yeah let
people know their options it's what it is uh yeah uh mike defton chat says I'm angry that people
don't actually listen yeah and uh dg ramas says I've been saying similar things for the last two
years on my podcast well if you think about it rama it's because we're both right all right I
had to sneak something out there all right let's actually get into some gaming news now that we're
what 45 minutes into the show uh hi dark soccer I see dark soccer joined the chat room so uh maybe
giving us some thoughts there uh virtually tonight so all right let's get into um excuse me some
actual gaming news uh loki you want to start us I have a lot of opinions on this too can't wait
you want to start us off with this yeah we can talk about this so um there was the whole d23
convention thing this week so there are lots of different announcements by disney regarding marvel
star wars lucas arts uh disney properties and different things with that so one of the
announcements was a brand new niantic game called marvel world of heroes that is supposed
to be coming out in 2023 they had a trailer for it and it looks generic af I don't even know what
the hell this is supposed to be but apparently you're supposed to be able to thwart crime take
on missions do nonsense I don't know and you team up with your friends as well as superheroes not
a single frame of game shown of course but this is as is tradition as is tradition for many of
these niantic announcements remember the very first pokemon go announcement did not have a
frame of gameplay in it I believe whenever it was they announced wizards unite although that was not
a niantic game that was um portkey games used in partnership with niantic using their stuff
um that I don't believe we saw a frame of footage in the launch trailer either so this is this is
par for the course so we know it's something to do with marvel superheroes and apparently in an
interview with one of the developers kind of gets into it's creating your own superhero which is I
guess somewhat of a first in these marvel games I didn't realize there were like no other marvel
games that you where you couldn't create your own hero um but I guess it also does kind of make
sense and it sounds like they're aiming for a very robust character creator that reflects you know
all the the spectrum of our society and all this stuff right now um so um I mean lego marvel
superheroes can create your own characters as well but yeah yeah okay well yeah so yeah I don't
but I I they were so I'm only saying that because it was in the interview or whatever they were
saying like oh well we're like the first so I don't I don't know what it is that they're they're
first thing but yeah there it is so and dark soccer is saying midnight suns and there was
another marvel phone game as well so some somebody over there is full of it or there's well there
there's one element of it that's new well midnight suns was it's going to be a brand new game but
like um there's yeah they have another like game coming out with um captain america and black
panther as well I'm not really sure that's all about but uh yeah this this I saw it I was like
cool except also like I don't know it's like doesn't there's so many niantic games that are
being announced and it's like will it really come out yeah we're seeing a lot of things we're not
seeing a lot of receipts for the announcements I think it's starting to to bug some people and I
get it how many games have they worked on that they just went eh well katan got cancelled we
know that one right it was being tested in australia new zealand and a couple other countries
as well and they they yanked it um so there's that oh questbusters clarifying in midnight sun
you can customize the hero but the hero is a new character created by marvel for the game
so that's the element because I believe in this one the hero is supposed to represent
you so you are this so I think that's what they're getting at but we're really getting into
weeds whatever like it doesn't matter as long as the game plays it doesn't it doesn't matter
it's the gameplay right it doesn't matter about the character so um although it would be nice if
all these this wide spectrum of society is something that is reflected in the game that's
great let me just put it this way now I take it's very easy you'll never recapture pokemon go
ever again you can try but it's never gonna happen again that lightning doesn't strike twice even
though you have thor but it's just it's never gonna happen I'm sorry you can throw whatever
property you want at this it's just not gonna happen um katan ever didn't happen transformers
but I believe that was also a third party making that in partnership with niantic that got cancelled
niantic laid off some of their staff we don't know why I suspect they were trying to push the
more google glass kind of ar gaming a little sooner maybe than it was ready um and maybe
that's but I I really don't know I can only speculate um but we also we know niantic has
announced recently a uh a game called peridot uh an original ip that we don't know anything about
yeah I'm more interested in something like that like I think honestly all these like
I mean pokemon was kind of a one-off but like it's just there's no property that really gets
me excited I love marvel stuff but like I am not excited at all about this and I get it I may not
be their target demographic although I don't know who would be then at that point but like it's just
I like the Pikmin game but I've talked about that a lot on the show and that is more I also
unlike you I have a default love for the ar and get outside and explore kind of games I've always
been a fan of niantic and that genre so that's you know that's it's obviously something um
something there um so uh what else do we know the nba game was announced that is coming but
we don't know much about that either so I think that's what the problem people are starting to
have when niantic is is that you're you're announcing too many things that either don't
come out or we don't know anything about it so niantic might want to re-examine their pipeline
from announcement to release because they've got too much now that they've announced that
they haven't released I get that they they made the announcement now because d23 so yeah that's
fine that makes sense it didn't it didn't have to be d23 it could have been any time
but here's here's why I think it's actually super newsworthy um is because when pokemon go came out
everybody tried to copy it and make their own type of pokemon go I don't think anyone was
successful at it what we had garfield go uh we had draconian go or whatever it was called
we had the jurassic park game which I feel like a couple people played that but I don't even think
that one's a big deal anymore and we just have seen that like in general other companies trying
to take on the strength of pokemon go wasn't working and I said from the very beginning it's
going to take a very strong ip to compete with pokemon go in fact I think the only company
that could really take on pokemon go would be disney
so the part of this news that strikes me as oh that's interesting is that disney isn't taking
it on they're partnering up so from my perspective whether you like it or not
niantic is now going to have the monopoly on these ar games for quite some time
until someone else can figure out a way to build a database of real world locations and collecting
this type of information that niantic is cleverly getting from their player base like portal scans
and pokestop scans and all this stuff that shows the stuff on the ground all this
unless another company can really think of a way to take that on in a way that niantic is now
already two or three steps ahead with this is this is like microsoft and game pass niantic is now
already three steps ahead of anyone else and this disney partnership now that there's nobody even
in the rearview mirror at this point so I that part to me is what's interesting is that yeah
disney just decided if he can't beat him join him mike defton chat says if you can't beat him
buy him I don't could could could disney buy niantic at this point I don't know
niantic may be too much money I I think they're worth a lot more than people think
but then again disney certainly has no shortage of money so I don't think disney wants to get
into gaming per se and they have lucasarts but like they're not really doing much with gaming
like it's very clearly they have no interest in making their own ar game so they are letting
niantic do it right so I don't think that they would purchase niantic I don't think they're it
yeah because for what yeah it like it would have to be like an amazing success like beyond pokemon
go to even drum up interest enough to do that yeah the the reason why someone will buy niantic
won't be the um games themselves it'll be the data niantic is amassing about the usage and
what the ground really looks like at some of those areas and stuff but that's that's the type of data
somebody's gonna want to buy from niantic at some point which is why niantic is kind of smart to
sort of license it in their own thing with the whole light shift but that's a whole
whole other thing anyway I think this is very interesting um again it's hard to say uh if the
game is going to be any good or not when we have literally not even seen one frame but just as
someone who's generally a fan usually of niantic stuff and I've talked at length about them on the
show um I wish them well I want to see it be good um good luck I can't wait to actually get my hands
on it hopefully so all right let's talk about the things we have gotten our hands on in this past
week let's talk about our gaming weeks I know I've had a lot low-key what about your gaming week what
do you mean it's all been minecraft I've been working on a single build for about a month now
designing it so it's now being it's done being designed it's probably going to be the largest
thing I've ever built I think you're gonna like it you just had something that you built that was
like the largest thing you ever built so you're one yeah that was yeah that was a mountain uh
a while back those 200,000 blocks I think this is like 300,000 at least it's very large it is
incredibly large but it it's pretty awesome it is mega man themed oh cool but it is it it is not my
mega base but it could it could have been my mega base if if I really wanted to be it's that big
but it is not a mega base it is just decoration the copper farm all right well everyone stay
tuned to Loki's uh youtube channel to uh check that out when it hits all right well as I've been
home sick and I I was I was supposed to go back to work Thursday obviously I didn't I've been home
pretty much sleeping and playing video games so I've had a lot uh and then of course there was
Dragon Con as well so pull up a chair I've got a few things to get into but I'll try to be quick
the game I've been playing most this week this week and weekend is Diablo 3 which I know is
kind of old but I've talked about it before I recently got back into it because I didn't really
care for Diablo Immortal um after the first 40 levels or so but um it made me realize I really
like Diablo 3 and I've been enjoying season 27 I'm up to Paragon 650 which is higher than I've
ever gotten Paragon wise Alan is up to 1200 uh in the season in the season not overall so uh
we've been both playing a lot of that game but it's been something we've been able to play
together which is cute so uh we've been having fun with that I have a wizard and I'm up to
greater rift level I think I cleared 90 earlier so I'm trying to work my way up into the hundreds
um I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14 Final Fantasy 14 right before I left for Dragon Con
released the new island sanctuary mode which is interesting because I know Disney also put out
their own Disney dream light which is kind of like this you know farming sim animal crossing sim sort
of game well they've also put something like this into Final Fantasy 14 with the island sanctuary
you go around and you gather materials you build things you then uh use the workshops to uh build
things you can export for items that you can then turn into cosmetic rewards like mounts and things
and all this stuff so you build up your island you can capture animals you keep them in a little part
of your sanctuary you grow plants so like it's got this whole little farm sim mode that's very
addicting in it right now that's been a lot of fun so I'm logging into that like every day to um
progress my island sanctuary so I don't raid my only savage content I do right now is savage
island sanctuary um and I've been having a lot of fun with that I've still been continuing in Dead
by Daylight as well uh they just released the project W or the um second Resident Evil pack
um which has made way too many Weskers in the killer pool um but he is an interesting killer and
uh you know very very hot like everybody from Resident Evil is so hot like I don't what what
is up like now I play Carlos super hot Ada Wong I also really hot like everybody is so hot from
Resident Evil um but I've been having fun playing the new characters um and just you know in general
leveling up um on the plane ride out to Dragon Con I played some Super Mario Brothers 2 on my Switch
because I was like I want to play a retro title and uh you know uh play something I can play start
to finish um on a plane ride so that's what I've been playing um then when I was at Dragon Con
Dragon Con had a whole little um they had two arcades they had a classic game room that was
also a bar and karaoke place and at the classic game room I got to play a bit of gyrus I actually
had the high score no I'm sorry the second high score on the gyrus machine for a hot minute because
I actually can still remember from the Commodore 64 days where the ship needs to be positioned in
the first few stages to get a perfect on everything so that's kind of fun I played some Street Fighter
2 with some friends that was very old school uh e Honda if you were wondering uh and then I played
some Mortal Kombat 2 as well so they had some great classic games and then I thought this was
really funny I watched my friend my friend saw this machine and he goes oh my god it's Galaga
I gotta go play Galaga I used to play so much Galaga when I was growing up and I was like
are you are you talking about Galaga he's he's like Galaga we always call the Galaga and I was
like I I think friend I think um I think it's Galaga because like galaxy it's galaxy if you're
in the galaxy it's Galaga what no it's it's Galaga and I was like okay well I watched him proceed to
get a very very large score on the Galaga machine so he was not just making this shit up he played
a lot of Galaga growing up and was still able to do very well for himself and it was the same thing
he knew everywhere you needed to be on the screen and so forth and all that stuff so dark soccer and
chat says you were always wrong here's the thing he's a friend I'd like him to stay my friend
is there hurting anything do I need to shit on his childhood no I I said what I needed to say oh
oh I thought it was Galaga like galaxy and he did acknowledge oh yeah you're probably right
and then continued to call it Galaga why why should I stop that what it's there's no harm in it
um and uh there was also a Japanese arcade so they used to have Tokyo Attack was the name of
the arcade but they Tokyo Attack went under for reasons and things um a couple years ago
so now there is a um a new company I think they're called Savepoint Arcade uh Bobby may have to
correct me on the name if I'm wrong but uh they were the ones that now come out and they brought
the Japanese like uh centered machines to the con and they had like a BeatMania 2DX Beastrover
I didn't realize they were gonna have freaking EMUs turned on or I would have turned on EMUs
so Bobby even got me some footage um of playing that game which he showed on his own show and
that was cool to play 2DX machine he they also had a BeatMania the final I hadn't seen one of
those machines since god did we go to like I think it was little Tokyo in LA was the last place I
ever saw one of those BeatMania the final machines so that was a trip to see that and I could not
remember how to play the songs uh on that game arcade infinity I think it's the last time I saw
that yeah yeah uh Bobby Blackwolf and chat says save point yes technically they aren't a new
company but they have stepped into the business that Tokyo Attack had okay awesome uh and then
the other game I got to play they had a lot more but the other game I actually played was Dance
Maniacs because you know if you've it's the one where you wave on the top and on the bottom and
it's a lot of fun and I miss that game so uh yeah I got to uh play a little bit of that so um Dark
Soccer I do not think this is the same group that does California Extreme because I I they're East
Coast based now granted if they're based in Maryland as Bobby says that is still quite the
trip uh but probably coming all the way out to the West Coast is even more of a trip there's
probably another company on the West Coast that does a lot of this stuff out here so um yeah and
if the 2DX machine was different then it probably wasn't the same group um but there's probably a
very similar group on the West Coast for sure um but getting over the Rockies with all those
machines is probably a big pain in the butt so you're probably always going to have your West
Coast and your East Coast and maybe maybe a Midwest company in there too who knows
um and then uh I I know the one you all want to hear about is uh the night I did stay at
Black Wolf Manor you know that Bobby Black Wolf has his own arcade right and he has his own
uh a few machines he has a Tron machine uh well these are these are um arcade one-ups like the one
the one behind me if you're watching live on Twitch if you're on the podcast feed you don't
see it but I have a Burger Time or a Data East arcade one-up replica cabinet
uh that sits behind me here um so uh Black Wolf has a Tron one and I joked and I said for some
time Bobby I'm coming over to your house I'm getting the high score on your Tron machine
and all I did all I did audience I did simply what I was going to say or what I said I was going to
do and I got the high score on his Tron machine with some practice it wasn't a great score so
with some practice Bobby will take it out in the next year and then he'll rub it in I'm sure and
it'll be fine I also played his Star Wars machine I did not get the high score on the Star Wars
machine I think if you wanted to get the high score on that machine you needed to start on
level nine and get the bonus for beating level nine I didn't do that so there was there was that
uh I also got to play pinball at Bobby's house Bobby has a Mandalorian machine which I think
he had last year because I remember playing that before um but he now has a Rush like the band a
Rush pinball table that was a lot of fun to play this was really cool I didn't know anything about
this until well it's like I heard here's the thing I'd heard of it and it's one thing to hear it
it's another thing to see it and do it and use it and this is the first time I used it
and that was Stern's QR code system they have now so they have this site that you can log into
uh with Stern pinball and you can actually scan a QR code on machines when you play them so it's
insider.sternpinball.com and there's this uh uh thing oh damn it I'm not logged in I was I was
going to show you the site otherwise um and you can log in a machine by scanning your QR code
and the really cool thing about that you get achievements and it tracks on your phone the
things you played and you have your own personal records and stuff like that and I think that is
brilliant because it brings something additional to pinball besides just pinball which is great
don't get me wrong but the thing with that is that you pay your dollar and you're done and you rarely
have anything to show for it it's like okay I had my little thrill for the experience I knocked some
balls around teehee and I'm done but now with this QR code thing if it's set up on the machine
not every Stern machine has them it's a separate thing they sell but Bobby Bobby put it on his
machines that he has with this QR code thing you scan the QR code thing and you get achievements
and you get to track your scores and all this really cool stuff so I played the rush table one
time and then Bobby told me about the QR code thing and I was like oh cool I gotta try that
and I'm like I want to get some achievements so let me try the rush table again I want to get some
achievements so I played the rush table again with my QR code and all this stuff and um balls
one and two didn't go so well ball three I went on a fucking bender on ball three I was alive for
a very long time on ball three and um I beat Bobby's high score on the rush machine too
oh that one I felt a little bad about because I didn't walk in there intending to do that
so I may or may not have gotten myself into a little hot water and there may or may not
literally be a sign outside of Bobby's arcade with my face on it at this point that says have
you seen this man or whatever it is and I just happen to have a shirt that day that said um
sorry I was mean to you on the internet
which I'd randomly bought at the mall uh a few weeks ago so I I said that so at that point I
wanted to play Mandalorian again I think I played it once just to like register that I'd played as
I was too afraid to do well on that machine because I don't want to make Bobby Blackwolf
cry like I don't want to make him cry like he's been very good you know what we have a good time
at Dragon Con we do some great business partner things together I got to watch him moderate some
awesome panels with the guys from Mortal Kombat and all this stuff he lets me stay at it I don't
want to make him cry so I had to I had to purposely kind of have a quick game of Mandalorian and let
that let that be that so luckily Mrs Blackwolf has already told me that she does not recognize
or authorize the ban or the signage that is outside the arcade so Mrs Blackwolf has
said I am welcome whenever I want so um Dark Soccer says Tron is at my house right now oh
the machine or the table because honestly I'd play either uh you probably don't want me coming over
right now uh but maybe in a week or so I'd love to come uh play that uh Dark Soccer says did my
friend Annie ever come by to say hi uh no I didn't I didn't meet any Annie so sorry to say but um
it there was no uh Dead by Daylight panels or anything like that so um I don't know if she's
your friend from that circle or somewhere else I don't know but um yeah didn't run into him
I will say one of the panels that we did was was the line capped an hour before the panel
and it seems like a lot of people who are trying to say hi to me or Bobby tried to come to that
panel uh and it was capped an hour beforehand because the Macarons were also on that so oh she
hosts some I heart podcast no I didn't see her sorry to say so um I guess there's always Dragon
Con 2023 because I I will be back I sure will I'm bummed that booster shot that's out there
now wasn't available two weeks sooner because I absolutely would have got it you know precautions
work but it is what it is when precautions are not followed here I am I follow them but everybody
has to follow them for them to work all right that's plenty enough about my gaming week oh I
should have mentioned the tilt five because Bobby did let me try that for the first time do you know
what the tilt five is Loki oh okay so long story short it's these glasses you wear and you stare
at this table thing it's they made it more for board games I think Bobby heard about it at Gen
Con but they have you know other like concept video games I I played a thing that was we'll
call it marble madness it wasn't actually marble madness but it was like a marble madness type of
thing or a monkey ball type of thing and you stare at this table and you see the image on
the table and as you look around it like moves with you and so forth because like it's like
projecting from the glasses onto this reflective material that's on the table and so it makes it
look like it's like um it's it's like a it's not VR it's a little more like AR but it's it's pretty
cool um till five is Jerry Ellsworth's AR goggles she was working on the valve cast AR before they
went VR that's Bobby's little summary there that was neat to see um but I didn't really get to
play any games on it it was just one concept demo so I'll be curious I watched Bobby do something
that looked a little Diablo-y to me and I was like what's that and he was uh because I guess
they had released some update and some new demos while we were at Dragon Con so he was kind of
trying them all for the first time so it feels like one of those things that still has a little
baking to do um so I'll be curious to see what kind of experiences they put on that that are
uniquely um for that tilt five okay now I have definitely talked too much about my gaming week
so let's get into some other gaming news uh let's get to it Loki yeah so there was also an Ubisoft
event where they talked about game announcements in a couple franchises um so some of the non
Ubisoft Assassin's Creed and Division announcements we had Mario and Rabbids
Sparks of Hope they showed off some more um a new trailer I think for that and that's set to come
out on the Switch October 20th and um also uh more on Skull and Bones still on its way um apparently
if uh you are part of Ubisoft's insider program uh you may be able to get a chance to play an early
version of the game uh Riders Republic is getting a season four update called Freestyling that
they're going to have um some skate parks and whatnot to actually be able to uh play in and
I think they're also adding BMX to that as well and I think that was oh um Netflix uh they're
going to be teaming up with them for a few different things I think Ubisoft related
I want to say they have an Assassin's Creed um game and tv show I'm not really sure what that's
about um Mighty Quest and Valiant Hearts 2 are I think mobile games that are going to be part of
Netflix's like gaming servicing that no one really cares about um Mythic Quest season three had a
uh trailer for that I can't believe that's on season three so that's I think still on Apple TV
um they talked about a free trial for Ubisoft Plus which is like a game pass on PC thing for
Ubisoft titles that's going to be um they're going to have a trail for that starting I think now it
runs until October 10th uh Trackmania a new version of that game is coming out supposed to
be free to play with no micro transactions so I'm not sure how they're making their money there
but there's going to be two premium tiers as well that you can buy into and they said the
seasonal updates every three months and that's supposed to be on all the modern consoles as well
uh Rocksmith Plus is like a I'm not sure if that's still going to be the similar I don't think
still have the accessories that go along with that but maybe a service that you can still learn how
to play the guitar and whatnot which is kind of cool uh new Just Dance game because of course
um and then a whole lot of Assassin's Creed whole lot Assassin's Creed so Assassin's Creed Mirage
which is the next big mainline game uh which is going to take place in um was it 9th century
Baghdad uh looks kind of cool they have an Assassin's Creed documentary talking about
the development of the game Assassin's Creed Valhalla is getting a last chapter for free
Assassin's Creed Codename Jade is going to be a mobile game that takes place in China in uh
215 BCE uh Assassin's Creed the the Netflix show we talked about a second ago they're
um not really sure what that's still going to be about but they're going to have a TV show as well
uh there is Assassin's Creed Codename Red which is supposed to take place in feudal Japan
Assassin's Creed Codename Hex which sort of has looks like the Blair Witch or something
something that has to do with witchcraft um and Assassin's Creed Infinity which is supposed to
somehow tie all this crap together this is what it sounds like when you're milking a franchise to
death so somebody has somebody has some lights to keep on over there good luck Ubisoft with that
Jesus Christ like um and then of course along with another franchise uh The Division so Tom Clancy's
The Division 2 um they're going to be doing like a new uh PvE mode and some other progression stuff
uh they said that there's supposed to be a season 10 with some quality life updates and
new difficulty modes and then season 11 is supposed to continue with the main story
uh Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland which is going to take place in middle America uh
there's also this Division Resurgence which is a mobile game uh that's going to be coming out
then Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Mobile also getting um you know obviously it's a mobile game as well
what else uh well we have some thoughts from chat uh Sia Tabiri says can I get an Assassin's Creed
that's set in the Edwardian area era excuse me and I'm actually just making clothes the entire time
don't encourage these people on further spin-offs because you joke but you know what why not a
farming sim set in the Assassin's Creed universe it's it's a cool new thing to do right now so
why not why not add clothes into that too Assassin's Creed My Little Cottage why not
you're also getting Assassin's Creed Symphonic Adventure which is a live concert
uh a podcast and a figurine who needs who needs a new podcast who needs any of those
I don't know like is there like I get it Assassin's Creed's a good it like I'm just
picturing for a second like if this was like Grand Theft Auto like if these were all like
Grand Theft Auto games that are being announced I would think that that's even too much like I'd be
like hold on like what the hell some of these sound cool like the Codename Red thing looks
cool but like that should be the game of the year you can't have like four four Assassin's
Creed games coming out at the same time like that is just ridiculous and I know these are
not all coming out the same time but like you know I don't need to know the 10 year
this is not the Marvel Cinematic Universe I don't need to know like the 10 mainline games
you have coming out for this series like just make a good game let's focus on the fruit in
the next game make it a good game please um going to an earlier comment in chat from I hope I don't
butcher this name Jess seven x uh in chat says will Beyond Good and Evil 2 ever come out
well you know it wasn't part of this so probably not you know what Dead Island 2 is apparently
finally happening so anything's possible um it ain't happening until it's actually out so
what's probably happening is that the fucking thing's getting delayed so much now they have
to re-scope it for a new console think about it when that game was first announced it was probably
being targeted for playstation 3 xbox 360 we're now on the playstation 5 and the xbox series x
like they're probably having to target that or maybe even beyond that at this point so it's
you know that that's probably what keeps pushing the thing back if you miss your target you can
really really miss your target and now you have to re-scope everything so so yeah but it's it's uh
I mean we haven't heard it's gotten cancelled but it could be one of those things where they're
basically gonna have to scrap it and start all over uh something more akin to what happened
with like final fantasy 15 duke nukem forever so you know let's see uh going to yeah quest buster
in chat says even as a ac I keep thinking animal crossing when I say ac which is funny but even as
an assassin's creed fan this seems like a lot of assassin's creed yes uh I guess the continues
quest buster I guess the uh ac version taking place in japan sounds cool right now but I'm
still thinking about ghost of Tsushima and how much more excited I am for an eventual sequel to
that uh ssho100 matt says eaves did an interview uh the ceo of ubisoft who you know we hate uh
where he basically strained himself patting himself on the back about the response of the
abuse scandal actual ubisoft employees are saying otherwise about said response actually happening
lift up those voices to make sure they catch the attention of the media and don't
let eaves gilmont drive that dialogue because that's exactly what he's trying to do with his
statements to the contrary so I hope uh the media will continue to report on what the workers are
actually saying about what's actually happening on that front which is not enough so uh eaves
gilmont probably needs to be removed as ceo already and if these 500 assassin's creed games
don't sell maybe that might finally happen although I somehow still still seem to doubt it
with um you know the amount of the stakeholder they have and all of that right pretty much yeah
yeah I can't imagine that'll happen all right um moving on to our next story uh it turns out that
facebook gaming is going to be losing their apps now I want to point out this doesn't mean that
it's been announced that facebook gaming is going away but this is how mixer started
the the beginning of the end basically um so facebook has sent out notifications to
partners that the apps will be shutting down in october and I guess one could argue youtube
gaming has also already done something similar and youtube gaming still has a presence so
it doesn't necessarily mean the end but it should be noted that facebook gaming has not really found
meaningful growth uh in game streaming the same way that um twitch and youtube have found those
things uh so yeah uh facebook gaming of course is run by meta uh they expanded even to irl streams
things like you know chatting art creation excel esports whatever uh they've got it on there uh
during the pandemic things like youtube and twitch have really gone up but facebook hasn't so much in
fact even facebook as a platform itself has seen declines in monthly active users earlier this year
and 20 of its share price uh was lost as a result so hmm so facebook gaming notified partners it is
going to be uh ending the mobile game streaming apps uh it is saying that they are continuing to
support game streaming within facebook itself but that doesn't mean that it's going to be something
they're going to continue to focus on or put a lot of money into and you might know that they've
put a lot of money into trying to get uh big talent over at um facebook gaming so
yeah it looks like it looks like it might be the beginning of the end for facebook gaming oh and
what's this in the article it looks like uh uh when reached out for comment uh rob roberts
from orange lounge radio the longest running podcast had the following to say about it
nah
i'm only petty sometimes
move but let's be real i hated the fact that facebook was getting into this space
i never liked them being in it and quite frankly i can't wait for them to get out
so sorry to my friends that use that platform to stream on stream on i don't want to say i told you
sell
have they tried like uh hot tub streams you know because i hear that this needs to be popular
low-key all right uh let's move on to uh our next story low-key uh this is funny this is a a
response um or the the playstation boss apparently calls out microsoft over um you know the inadequate
call of duty deal they're saying so you may remember that microsoft has committed that
call of duty is still going to be on the playstation platforms for now um at least you
know for at least several more years um but they're saying that um he basically said i
hadn't intended to comment on what i understand to be private business discussion but i feel
i need to set the record straight because phil spencer brought this into a public forum
throwing shade already um microsoft has only offered call of duty to remain on playstation
for three years after the current agreement between activision and sony ends after uh almost
20 years of call of duty on playstation their proposal was inadequate on many levels
and failed to take an account of the impact on our gamers we want to guarantee playstation gamers
continue to have the highest quality quality experience and microsoft's proposal undermines
this principle says the company or wasn't it sony or maybe i'm thinking maybe it was microsoft
somebody had like the tomb raider exclusive rights or would they do these timed things all the time
so that's like pot con that's the pot calling the kettle black at this point like microsoft sorry
like i don't microsoft had rise of the tomb raider for a year yeah yeah exactly but sony still has
final fantasy 7 remake exclusive exactly we haven't nailed that exactly and so and they've
had other exclusives before that as well um honestly like be glad they gave you three years dude
seriously like be glad they gave me look on one hand sony is just doing what they have to do from
a business sense like it right it would not be good business for them not to take a swing at it
you know however they feel the need to do it it doesn't make them right but i understand why they
have to say this stuff because you know legally it would they they are in the business of making
money and for them to roll over and you know have this franchise potentially leave them even in four
years with as much money as it makes is a big deal yeah it's what here's how it's gonna go down i
think is they'll keep it cross-platform for now on sony's platform until the playstation 6 whatever
the next xbox console gets announced and we're talking about new console launching and it's like
oh hey well if you won't play call of duty you got to come to this console now yeah that's how
it's going to go because um right now it is in their best interest to keep it multi-platform
because they're going to make a ton of money off of those users but later on when they were trying
to sway people to buy into an xbox console that's how you do it leverage with this stuff and i'm
sorry but like you can cry all about you want but you're doing the same thing so
i don't know whatever um sj100 matt chat says serious question if sony made this deal with abk
instead of microsoft would sony be as generous with microsoft or as this or would they pull it
from anything that's not pc or sony consoles they would have pulled it immediately you'll have a
chance to find out whenever destiny 3 happens so you know sony sony's been buying their own
companies lately too uh so you'll have a chance to find out if rumors are to be believed sony
will own square enix eventually i don't know how i don't know how much i believe that one but you
know anything is possible at this point so uh bobby blackwolf says sony will say we're not
doing the same thing with the top selling games in this country as what bobby says in chat so
yeah all right meanwhile anybody that's interested in playing any of these games
pc man you get sony games you get microsoft games you got everything yeah i mean i love
consoles still i do but you know there's lots of great if you but pc you just have to make sure
you have the the pc that can handle these newer games and that's not really in the realm of
affordability for a lot of people so there's definitely still a place for consoles for sure
um before i get into the next story i wanted to mention this comment on the last story about uh
facebook uh from uh sj100 matt who said uh zuckerberg uh couldn't be reached for comment
he was in his awkward metaverse that was that i don't how is any how is anybody supposed to
believe that the metaverse is the next big thing with those like it looks like something that
would have been at least clarified that that was an early screenshot and then they have better
stuff but like yeah it doesn't matter though because it's just uninteresting i don't care
if it's like super photorealistic it's still boring like it doesn't matter like what are you
doing with it like how how does this revolutionize anything other than it being a chat room that you
do unnecessary like you want me to go work there too yeah like no uh when pushed for further
comments zuckerberg also said solo sucks anyway um let's see also uh in chat uh metaverse bobby
blackwolf there's like three people that'll get that joke bobby blackwolf says playstation home
looked better than that metaverse yes sj100 matt says second life looks better than that metaverse
yes that's a lot of the big problem with it that's for sure all right going to this last story sorry
i'm getting the comments out of order but i'm reading as fast as i can um she-hole 10 i thought
had a great perspective here saying call of duty will have to replace a broken halo series 343
studios dropped the ball on halo yeah you know i have been hearing a lot of not great stuff out
of halo like the whole like uh split screen mode ended up getting cancelled and just like
they're not but you can glitch it back into the game somehow yeah that the the the road map and
and the the direction that halo reach has been going not where they hope that would be that's
for sure so that is very interesting what she-hole brings up though is that maybe microsoft needs a
shooter to fill a gap that their current shooter is is not filling for people very interesting
so yeah all right anyhow uh let's move on and talk about more news uh we were talking about
conventions earlier in the show and there's another one uh that was scheduled to come up
in january it's awesome games done quick uh but it will no longer be happening in person it was
going to be happening in florida but they announced this week that uh games done quick
uh the 2023 awesome games done quick event will be online it's going to be virtual again
january 8th through the 15th but here's the interesting thing they already had one of these
in person so it isn't covid directly that's responsible for the reason why they're shifting
this online however there's a couple reasons why they're shifting this online uh the organizers
want to return in person but in order to quote provide a safe and welcoming event to all they
need to move away from their plan location in florida in the statement they said given the
state's continued disregard for covid 19's dangers including anti-mandate policies and an increased
aggression towards lgbtq individuals including the law colloquially known as don't say gay
we do not believe it is a safe place for our community that is taking quite a stand on both
those fronts uh we know that florida has not exactly been the most covid precaution
encouraging state while i believe they could have a mask mandate in florida still on private
property at the hotel if the hotel and the convention could reach that agreement like
they did in minnesota for that event they just had over the summer i believe they cannot per
florida law mandate vaccination and i noticed they didn't call out masks in what they said they said
anti-mandate policies so they can't mandate that everybody has to be vaccinated and therefore
they're not willing to put people at risk so that's you know what it's it's about time florida
paid a price for some of these things that they keep you know it just sucks that it's a charity
event but the charity is still going to make money in the online form the charity i don't think will
lose anything out of this and you know we're going to get more speed runs submitted from around the
world because more people will be able to participate more people will be able to participate
virtually so i think that end of it in fact even when they did do it in person it was kind of cool
that they still had some stuff that was virtual so they could really get the best of both worlds
i think that's the that's the um marathon a lot of us would like to see because in person you get
the in-person reactions the in-person memes like there's a lot of guys i'm not saying it should
always be online i i love having a little bit of both but i i have to applaud games done quick for
taking a stand and even though they they really try not to be politically uh you know motivated
or whatever because you know people have their opinions all over the spectrum and what have you
the reality is lgbtq people there's a lot of them that volunteer and work with games done quick
and florida doesn't really feel like a safe space for folks right now so i understand why they did
it um so i mean the charity will still have it will still make money the event will still happen
it'll be online we'll miss the live reaction stuff and so forth but this is what they had to do to get
out of the car actually they can't get out of the contract but it's it's it's the easiest way to
remedy the situation we'll leave it at that right and it should be fine like it was fine the years
that they had to do it online anyways it wasn't like it was a worse event it was just different
so yep that is uh gonna be in january of 2022 bobby and chad is pointing out they are risking
bankruptcy by doing this um good point because even though it is a charity organization
um they are still an organization that has an income and an out outgoing funds and all that
stuff because um they you know they run their channel throughout the year that isn't necessarily
a charity fundraiser it helps them fund these different events and so forth so it's going to
different events and so forth so it is a company that puts on charity events there's kind of a
different sort of thing to it so they they could go bankrupt from this whole thing um
but i i i think it would be a really ugly look if the hotel sues this organization into oblivion
i i i'm you know it it is what it is we'll see what happens i realize business isn't always
nice or about the right thing um so we'll see what happens i wonder if and i bobby i have no
idea if you know this or not are they still sending a because i know when they when they
still do the virtual ones they send a skeleton crew to the site as basically the base of operations
so technically aren't they still for seeing their contract through by sending people to that hotel
as the base of operation of course i'm assuming they're still doing that maybe they're not even
going to do that because of the uh uh oh they do it from the virginia office says bobby they don't
go to the site they do it out of virginia all right then that answers that i thought they went
to the hotel and still did it there all right then all right uh let's move on with some more
stories loki what do you have for us yes so apparently twitch is permanently removing its
host mode on october 3rd um so apparently the hosting command and auto host features
will be gone which is really stupid um i don't yeah i'm not a fan they announced their change
in an update to their how to host or how to use host mode page uh saying that the experience
it delivers doesn't match their expectations when they come to twitch i i don't understand why you
would remove it like i don't see what the gain is i'm doing that i understand that there is confusion
between hosting and rating and that whole thing and it causes a little bit of like you know
confusion issues for especially for a newer streamer what do i do what's better and so forth
but um i think one of the big problems on twitch that everybody complains about
is discoverability and what's very interesting especially you know having sat on a few panels and
heard a lot of perspectives from this on the digital media track at dragon con this last week
it sounds like a platform that does discoverability very well is actually tik tok and i even think
about my own experiences with tik tok where i posted a random video that wasn't even funny
i have something like 750 views with no promotion so the discoverability on uh algorithm on tik tok
is pretty darn good the discoverability on twitch not the greatest usually the people that are on
the front page are already partners and it ends up being a rich get richer type of situation
so where hosting was good was that if i'm not live i could promote a channel in my place
basically on the main page in a little place that says hosting or you know channels being
hosted right now and something to keep in mind that i think even twitch forget sometimes is
there's a lot of us who still watch on playstation on xbox and so forth and there's a whole little
bar that shows the channels that are being hosted right now and i do look through that when none of
my friends are live or honestly none of my friends are playing anything i really want to see i'll go
look through the hosting and see well what's being hosted that might be interesting to look at
so i think where this is frustrating people is that they're taking discoverability away that's
what's happening and although twitch tries to say that well rating can take its place and so forth
i disagree because rating isn't something that's always there like for instance for us here at vog
network we used to say at the end of the show hey put us on your auto host list because there's a lot
of you that probably aren't live sunday night but by hosting us then we'll show up as a recommended
thing on your friends pages as something to check out that's why hosting is great rating doesn't do
any of that so there is a clear difference between those two things rating is a one-time thing hosting
is something that was kind of always there so i think that's why it's very frustrating that we're
losing it now if twitch were to turn around and say here's some discoverability we're going to
put in its place i think it would soften the blow a lot better yeah what they're discovered with
their um their suggestions are just give them a shout out to help them gain some followers send
your viewers to their channel at the end of your stream suggest channels for viewers to um to
viewers when you're offline yeah like that was we could already do that it's just i don't know um
yeah no i i agree now if only twitch had something very large planned for about the time that this
feature is sun setting to announce something new to enhance discoverability for our friends
if only they had a large convention with a keynote speech where they could announce something that
could really soften this blow a bit fingers and toes crossed well they said they're they're
reasoning for it they said that uh what viewers want to interact with the streamer when they're
live and host mode blocks us from happening preventing viewers from interacting with the
streamer they are watching also limits the streamer's growth potential um okay well then
don't do that like make it so that it auto like it kind of think of it instead of an auto host
it's a forwarder types of things you know what's it you know and it's like i do agree with you
loki but you know what's interesting i've got an interesting use case for you for why it should be
separate sometimes and that is what we do here at vog network for large events and we're going
to lose this because of this so for example when a microsoft keynote is going on if we're having
to work or something and bobby and myself or you jamie whoever is unavailable to do a simulcast
which we could still do we would usually host it and have our own chat that is a lot less
shit posted than the large chat that's happening during a microsoft or playstation event it's
just us in a chat watching the same event we could really benefit from that and many people
in chat are referencing that right now although bobby is also stating the reality i could honestly
count on one hand how many people participated yes that is the honest you know truth there
and we can still simulcast them as our schedules permit you know we so it says that the auto host
will be changed to suggested channels in your channel settings i don't know what that necessarily
means well i'll be curious to see what that looks like and how that might help lead to discovery
because maybe that won't be as bad as we think so we'll see we'll have to see what that looks like
in practice so yeah all right um let's move on we're going to uh go to a classic segment that
we do here on this show even though dark sakura is not here tonight we always have a plan b so
let's get to our next segment and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive
into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of
the week all right and dark soccer is not here tonight so i'm doing this segment instead tonight
but i did pull a page out of dark sakura's book and i picked a game that is 10 years old in this
last month and this is one you're probably going to be surprised rock band blitz is the classic
game of the week which was originally released on the playstation 3 august 28 2012 or on the xbox
360 august 29th of 2012 that's right this game just barely qualifies that it as it just turned
10 years old a couple of weeks ago and usually that's where we draw the line is that a classic
game of the week needs to be about 10 years old and mike defton chat over at uh twitch.tv slash
vlog network says i miss this game me too when i saw that this was on the lit because you know i
went over and i was like what games you know turned 10 recently and i saw this and i was like
no way not this game i loved this game in some ways i like this game even more than the rock band
games because you didn't need the plastic instruments to play it let's talk a little bit
about rock band blitz those of you that are watching live can see the footage here those
of you on the podcast i'll tell you a little bit about it and uh uh what we're seeing on the screen
here so this was a game that was released by harmonix in 2012 as i mentioned it was only an
online title so it was not something you could get retail uh it did not come with plastic instruments
it was meant to be played with a controller uh the gameplay mechanics were similar to other
harmonix titles that had been released prior including frequency amplitude and rock band
unplugged which i believe was the vita no the psp i think that one was on uh 25 songs came with
the game and the big clincher with this songs from any other version of the game that were exported or
downloaded as dlc or anything like that you could use all of it so that was what made this
game awesome is that you probably had thanks to rock band you had a library of tons of songs
all ready to go with this but here's the bummer about this game and i'm not sure somebody who
follows the wiki or either dark soccer herself may know better i don't know if we've had a game that
we've spotlit that you can literally no longer play today i mean i guess well i say that but
if you have it on your 360 now nobody uninstalled it through 360 but if you've never played this
game before there's no way for you to get it it was delisted on august 28th 2017 so five years ago
it was removed so on the five-year anniversary the game was removed and that was due to the music
license expirations so we have an interesting classic game where it's like if you don't have
this game there is no way for you to get it you're gonna have to find a friend that still
has it on their 360 or playstation um or um uh something else oh dark soccer suggests pt
she may have done at some point and that would be in a similar boat oh yeah i guess i guess
that is a very similar boat where it was also delisted so there is that so anyway uh rock band
blitz it's a note matching rhythm game again it's very similar designed a frequency amplitude rock
band unplugged you have five lanes that match lead guitar bass guitar drums vocals and keyboard
and they go through the different streets oh thanks orange right pt isn't 10 years old so
it couldn't have been done yet it's getting close though all right anyway um and uh there's only a
single difficulty level i think that's interesting because the rock band games had different uh
difficulty levels within the songs uh you can customize the controls but you use the buttons
on the gamepad to basically hop between different lanes and you score points for each note that you
get and once you get enough points in a lane you basically capture the lane and that lane auto
plays for a portion of the song uh when you build a blitz meter you move faster along the tracks
until you miss a few notes and you get a scoring bonus during that time once you complete a song
you are rated on a scale of one to five stars which is reflected of your total scores and
you're given both cred which unlocks power-ups and it reflects on your long-term performance
you get overdrive power-ups from the cred as you get white notes it fills the overdrive meter
you can then activate the overdrive power-up which is a two times scoring multiplier or you
can have the computer play one note for one track for you for a period of time or you can do a
bottle rocket which sends out a shock wave uh i guess an out of control car goes through the track
and it scores points for all the notes that are hit you also have note-based uh power-ups uh
where certain notes are marked purple and uh while you hit the notes uh you do the effects of that
power-up for example you can explode all notes on nearby tracks for points you can create a pinball
that while it hits different notes and you keep it in play it will score points that's pretty cool
and a sprite that moves between tracks that you try to catch to earn points and then lastly there
are track-based power-ups uh they're either active on different tracks during the song
that double the point values of a particular track or it's activated when you switch a track
or whatever so there's all these different things to do it also there was a facebook application for
this rock band world that could actually track online scoreboards so that way you can compete
with friends even between xbox and playstation platforms you also because it's all about the
sales would get recommended dlc uh through uh what your friends are playing and so forth so
the development of this game it was a departure from past rock band titles project director
matthew nordhaus referred to it as saying instead of having the focus on musical authenticity and
a performance simulation this is an arcade game it's fast loud silly and a little over the top
the game was originally called synchrony but then they changed it to rock band blitz uh and because
one of the power-ups was called the blitz and that's i guess what they they got it from uh
they did experiment with some other mechanics like having three notes per lane uh because i
believe there's only two in what was originally or what ended up being set up uh could you use
analog controls for vocal tracks uh and so forth so but they they kind of threw these out we got
we got what we got um they did experiment with instrument controls but ultimately found there
was no easy way to include them in the title and they realized this was going to be a single player
game but this is why they went to social elements like the facebook platform to kind of get that
simulation of playing and challenging other people uh they launched blitz with the rock
band world facebook application and then again it allowed you to compare your progress and so forth
so uh the game was originally premiered at the 2012 penny arcade expo east convention
uh i think that was one that i went to actually and it was shown to members of the press during
the game developers conference in 2012 uh at the end harmonix did say they would remove blitz from
playstation and xbox live due to the expiration of music licensing agreements uh they do not have
plans to make the games backwards compatible again probably because of those same licensing
issues and this game is not backwards compatible on either xbox or playstation platform at this
time and i don't know if it ever will be uh due to the music issues so um i would go over the list
but there's a lot a lot of songs in the list here so i'll just call out a few favorites you know i
love me some kelly clarkson so stronger was one of the songs that was in the game raise your glass
by pink moves like jagger which was all over the radio uh by maroon 5 uh was was in the game as
well and how about a queen song because we love queens so death on two legs uh was in the game
as well but that's just really just a small portion of the list uh rock band blitz got
generally a positive reception including a 77 on metacritic and a 76.9 on game rankings if you uh
care about that sort of stuff uh it was praised for the core gameplay and the leaderboards but
there was a criticism that it didn't really draw solo players uh that if you're not into high
scores there wasn't as much of a reason to do it uh it was called out that social hooks could have
been better implemented uh but if you have a large library of rock band tracks hey you're gonna have
a lot here for you so um that's pretty much all i have to say about it i spent a lot of hours on
this game i really like this game i think it really stinks that we don't have a backwards
compatible version of this game i wish they would release just the player for those of us that still
have a large library of rock band tracks maybe take out the music i understand why it's one of
those things that's easier said than done i just you know i thought this game was great and i
really would love to see harmonix visited again sometime even if i didn't love the amplitude
reboot that came after this but that's another story so there it is your classic game of the
week rock band blitz did you ever play rock band blitz loki uh i did when it first came out yeah
not very much yeah um i think i just downloaded because uh you know i played my full library of
rock band songs and i had a ton of songs so it made sense yeah um was it the opposite too because
i know like with a lot of those games you can kind of move them between different games like i know
with like rock band 2 you can import like yeah lego rock band and stuff like that all those songs
and mike def points out you could also export the rock band blitz songs and play them in the real
real rock band you know the main line i guess or whatever franchise that's what that's what
was worth it for a lot of those like i remember was it um i think it was like a rock band that had
uh like i had the tiger or something like that there was like one of those like i oh i got to
get those songs it was like lego lego rock band had a yeah yeah yeah so like it was it was worth
like just purchasing the game because i think it was like super cheap at one point just to get the
licensed songs so you can pull them in like regular rock bands so that's pretty cool all
right um we really just have a few more stories for you um i know that might seem kind of like
a surprise but um a there wasn't quite as much gaming news this week with the labor day holiday
and you know everything else going on and b i knew i probably wasn't gonna last a full three
hours tonight so we don't have quite as many stories slotted tonight um but i will encourage
you if you do want to call into the show uh you can join our green room over at vog network.com
that's vognetwork.com slash discord um dark soccer is not here tonight but for those that are

a couple of days i did and i regretted it because i lost my voice but um i played with uh nick and
a couple of times and uh played with gwen as finora and you took my place on a stream the
other night well i didn't realize that you were already playing when i reached out before so
yeah no it's and it's it's fine because i i i could i really i i wasn't quite over covid so
i was really and i'm still not really but like it was one of those i could maybe do this for like 90
minutes and then dinner was coming in anyway so it was like all right i'm leaving and then
i left to go eat dinner when i came back i was like oh jamie took my place that's cute i love
that so but it looks like you guys had fun i also had wanted to play with uh tay and black's again
for a while oh yeah there's there's so much fun i love that group they are they are a trip to both
of them yeah and they were increasingly drunk by the end of uh as is typical for friday night
streams yeah right um but man though the state of dbd right now is stinkier and stinkier and
stinkier and west career and west career well it's it's just like the camping has gotten worse

all resident evil which is but everybody like shiva everybody from resident evil is so hot
i'm gonna go on record though and say i don't think carlos looks good his hair is a hot mess
i don't know i kind of like a guy with messy hair well no i'm not saying it's messy i'm saying it's
poorly rendered the same thing with all of the attack on titan most of the attack on titan hairs
and also most of yui's my like her new ones my imagination fills in the uh
imperfections my brain goes into design nerd stuff so um but uh but at any rate um i have
been playing cult of the lamb uh that's like my monday thing and of course that'll be a
a silent stream for me because i am i have been on an almost vow of silence

and then i sacrificed somebody else all right all right dark soccer we'll enjoy um further cult of
lamb good luck with everything and uh we hope to have you back next week later taters all right
bye uh let's get into some rapid fire news we just have a couple stories for you and we'll
start with loki yep so uh this is kind of cool and uh basically you may remember there's been
a few games that they've done this where they've reverse engineered hobbyists have reverse
engineered a certain nintendo games not even necessarily just nintendo um because i remember
they did that with the i think it was like vice city or something like that for playstation but
anyways um so now they have reverse engineered the uh legend of zelda link to the past and they
have ported it to pc so it's running natively on pc now uh this is thanks to a github user snes rev
who has uh put together the code to do that now of course you have to have a legally obtained
version of the rom available and then using some uh python scripts you can convert it into an
executable for the pc uh it runs all right right now they don't it's like running but they don't
have like all of you know the fancy features like you know upscaling or uh full screen remappable
controls and that type of stuff yet but you know it's being worked on until it gets shut down by
nintendo so go download it while you can all right i have one quick story for you also out
of the d23 expo and that is that a new tron game is coming and you know this caught my attention
right it is a game called tron identity but it might not be what you think because this game is
apparently going to be more of a visual novel it's not going to feature anybody from the movies so
it's just kind of set in the tron universe but i'm actually like totally okay with that i actually
like that idea of trying to establish things that are independent from the movies because i
like the movies have been in development hell for you know we all have heard that there's that
mysterious third movie they're talking about making that jared letto may or may not be involved
with and i hope it's not um but regardless the the the tron um legacy was 2010 it's been 12 years
since that movie so like if a sequel is going to happen you would hope it would happen sooner
rather than later of course it took what 28 years the first time so oh so anyway i i like
that disney is trying to establish some tron things that are outside of the movie universe
so that maybe tron can continue and i'm still jazzed that they are opening a ride i think
they showed test footage of the ride today uh i think they said it's going to be early next year
i'd love to go to something like i was seeing uh because there's a few people on um on youtube that
i follow that do like the park you know like the pov park ride stuff yeah someone was saying like
the people movers are coming back because that's exciting news that is a huge rumor right now is
that people movers are coming back yeah i hope so i love it yeah i would love to see that too
but anyway uh tron identity is a game that is coming out um in 2023 and it is a visual novel
and puzzle game it's being developed by mike befell who made thomas was alone so that's a
pretty big resume item and the solitaire conspiracy uh in the game you will follow
query a detective program that is keeping the peace on an all new grid query is tasked with
unraveling a break-in and theft that occurred um you will advance the story by uh defragging other
programs identity disk um so once you defrag the disk you get to the path that shows the solution
for the unique puzzles uh it should be noted uh this is and what's interesting this article i'm
looking at says that tron is the first disney uh tron game for pc or console since tron 2.0
that is incorrect uh in 2004 there was a tron runner game that came out and i think that was
the name of it was tron run run are yeah so um how about that way to get way to do your job
gaming journalist uh no i'm just giving him shit there was that tron run our game that was out i
want to say that was around 20 it was a few years after the movie i want to say that 2015 2016
so it's it's been a little bit but yeah uh also um this is completely neglecting
the tron legacy uh xbox 360 and p um maybe that one wasn't on pc but i think it was
so they neglected that one too it was i think it was called just tron legacy but it was like
a tie-in game that was on like the 360 and playstation 3 yeah that was more of a traditional
adventure game so it's trying evolution try evolution thank you okay that's what it was
so there have been other tron games just so you know all right uh that's it for our rapid
fire news let's travel around the world and check out some release dates loki do me a solid
and do us and uk back to back if you can i have to take a restroom emergency i'm sorry i'll be back
okay and they did have a pc version of trial and evolution so i don't really know what they're
talking about they just didn't research enough what uh anyways so we have quite a few things
coming out this week we have freedom planet 2 on pc uh ice on nose or was it ice on zo
that's a weird name uh pc playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one xbox series a little
orpheus on pc nintendo switch playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one xbox series scp secret
files they're finally getting an official game for that that's on pc sunday gold on pc as well
the voice of cards the beasts of burden on pc nintendo switch and playstation 4 13 is getting
a nintendo switch release bear and breakfast on nintendo switch as well that game looks so cute
blind fate ito no yami on pc nintendo switch playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one and xbox
series despots game on pc mac and linux nintendo switch playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one and
xbox series dragon quest uh 10 offline fun fun name for that um that's on uh pc nintendo switch
playstation 4 and playstation 5 dungeons 3 on nintendo switch fairy fencer f refrain
cord on nintendo switch playstation 4 and playstation 5 vault stp light
crab i have no idea how you pronounce that that's on nintendo switch metal hell singer on pc
playstation 5 and xbox series uh the outer wilds coming to playstation 5 and xbox series sbk22
on pc playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one xbox series and last but not least
trinity trigger on nintendo switch playstation 4 and playstation 5 then in the uk we've got
uh looks like eizenzo uh deluxe edition and i guess that's a world war one game that's out on
playstation and xbox uh 13 also coming out on playstation xbox and the switch the alfred hitch
cock vertigo on playstation xbox and switch recompile on playstation uh let's see dungeons
3 on nintendo switch uh and then this is probably my favorite one for the week here yuppie psycho
executive edition on playstation and nintendo switch what the hell is that that sounds
incredible it looks like a visual novel probably of course i'm a japanese game and then uh under
knots labyrinth of yomi on the playstation we have arcade gettin on uh playstation and xbox
fell seal um arbiter's mark on playstation switch and pc and that's it all right
was that the uk and us that was uk and us all right let's go to japan and the big release this
week in japan i think uh on the nintendo switch this week is dragon quest 10 offline so this was
announced a little while ago where this is uh you know the version of dragon quest 10 uh where you
don't have to pay to do an mmo anymore um i hope i hope this gets localized for the us because we
never got to play dragon quest 10 in any capacity so we'll see uh a regular and deluxe edition are
bound for japan on the 15th uh we also have on the switch fairy fencer f refrain cord comes out
trinity trigger is also out and uh that is it for the switch if we go over to the playstation 5
uh dragon quest 10 offline is also released on the playstation on the playstation 5
uh fairy fencer f and trinity trigger also so i guess those are your big games but there's one
more on the playstation 5 and that is japan's release of destroy all humans 2 the reprobed
edition also in japan this week you can pick up a playstation 5 horizon forbidden west bundle uh
that is out in a uh regular and uh the digital edition of ps5 so um that is the version of the
that uh i guess just comes included with the game or so i guess the playstation itself doesn't look
any different so okay yeah that's weird all right i'm trying to see if maybe there's like a subtle
engraving or something on it because i when i saw it i assumed it was a limited release console but
i guess not all righty then all right uh let's move on with a couple more stories loki yes so
gamesop has been accused of wiretapping customers um and this is it's not as crazy as it sounds
so basically what it is they are not complying with the california's invasion of privacy act
which they can't basically website operators can't create transcripts of visitors conversations and
this is happening in their support chat is what's happening um they're saying that apparently the
company is uh taking secret transcripts of those wiretaps and they're sharing them with
a third party that helps them boost its ability to harvest personal data
but anyways so they do have a lawsuit though um that's basically saying that you know that
compliance with sipa is easy and the vast majority of companies comply with the law
by simply notifying website visitors if their conversations are being recorded
so you know how you you know hear those messages whenever you call an 800 number or something like
that that they're recorded for you know quality and training purposes which is which is you know
because i did work in a call center for a very long time many years ago and they you know uh we
would play the calls and training class absolutely that was something that we would do um to to learn
from them and so forth um but also yeah calls get randomly audited that's how uh companies make sure
because they i don't know how much i should say well i don't work there anymore and it's been a
long time but but they they found out that um some of the people working were um hanging up on
customers and they can only do that through the uh audit process so it's an important part to keep
the integrity of what's going on in this case they're saying that the uh that game stop is
allowing zendesk to intercept and use the transcripts from these well zendesk is apparently
a like ticketing system so i don't know how malicious it is that they're doing that but
at the very least they should probably be complying with the the sipa act um in order to
you know not getting hot water for this stuff but you know it seems benign to me it's not like a
like oh we're capturing all this data and we're selling it to you know advertisers and we're gonna
figure it out no i think it's it seems a little litigious um but
we'll see if anything comes of this i doubt it all right um let's move on into one more story for the
night um and it's a sad one uh we lost uh a gaming great this last week i think this is
actually the week we were out um but i'm gonna mention it anyway on august 30th uh the president
of miracle kids uh mitsuhiro yoshida passed away suddenly uh although you may not be familiar with
miracle kids with a z uh you would know mitsuhiro yoshida as uh one of the people uh that was on the
team at uh technos japan who created the series like river city ransom super dodgeball and nintendo
world cup these were all part of the kunio kun series and i believe there's even a compilation
of like kunio kun games that came out just within the past couple years miracle kids was made up
largely of former staff there and they even continued to produce titles in the kunio kun
series most of these are now owned by arc system works um so uh in a statement that was posted to
twitter uh mitsuhiro yoshida president of miracle kids and one of the key creative figures behind
classic kunio kun titles including nes super dodgeball and river city ransom passed away on
august 30th suddenly that's all they said was suddenly they didn't give any more details
but still what a um what a terrible loss uh for the industry um unfortunately these stories of
loss do not end there i would need to say something as well about um a very well-known
video game journalist who also passed away while we were out um on this last week and that was mike
fahey uh who is with kotaku oh wow and say which say what you oh you didn't hear about this no i
haven't heard about oh well you've been very busy paying attention to other things um no mike fahey
passed away um at 49 um he passed away on friday and uh you know he he was having some medical
problems over the past couple years um so uh he uh had a aortic dissection in 2018 that is where
the body kind of tear your main artery and it left him paralyzed and he was using a wheelchair
he had another one of these tears in april and a subsequent infection unfortunately was the cause
of death so it's a very very tragic um say what you will about kotaku over the years um and we've
said plenty um but uh mike fahey definitely seemed like he was always one of the good guys and um
you know i i there's not a lot i i did not have a lot of interactions with him so i can't say a lot
however i know um our pal bobby blackwolf who we work with here at vog was also in the atlanta area
where mike fahey was and has a lot more to say on his show this week and gives a much better tribute
so i would encourage you to listen to that show but um obviously um you know gaming journalism
of a certain area was absolutely in part shaped by mike fahey so that's a huge loss as well so
um sjo and her matt wants to point out kotaku had a very nice write-up with stories from various
people in the industry uh yeah i just saw that yeah dartesia says yeah i didn't know him but
damn if i didn't see his articles on kotaku mike def says mike fahey was one of the few people at
kotaku that was worth reading so um yeah so that's a very unfortunate uh loss as well in the industry
this week so all right well with that i'm going to try to move into our listener roundtable and
invite your calls over at the green room over at twitch.tv slash vog i'm sorry that's how to watch
our show live vog network.com slash discord uh is where you can uh tune in uh and join our uh
green room and uh oh i see somebody's already already jumping on the opportunity so let's get
to it well hello you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey hey hey it's the one and only
ron how is everybody doing tonight fabulous how are you it's so good to hear from you it's been
it's been a minute i'm doing good you know i over you look good well i i try i try i i discovered
something called the uh the rob roberts diet it's kind of similar to you know to to the richard
simmons diet it's been kind of working it's been kind of helping you know oh actually so like more
walking playing pikmin and that sort of thing it's it's more walking and drinking a lot more water
no it's good water's good and i i i love richard simmons i i take that as a an ultimate compliment
he's an amazing human being i could i could do an entire three hour talk on how richard simmons is
completely underappreciated and a gift we don't deserve but anyway i'll save that for another day
what's on your mind you didn't call it to talk about richard simmons what do you want to talk
about well things but before i continue i do want to say loki my deepest condolences
i i understand what you're going through and we got you bro
thank you you're welcome uh secondly i i kind of want to
tag along to something what bobby black was said about uh game zone quick let's say for for the
sake of it they they sent like a skeleton team to that to the venue just just just for the sake of
it now upon top of the fact that the company will have to pay cancellation fees from the venue
there's additional fees for the rooms because when you sometimes when you get these venues you got to
promise that you're going to fill x amount of rooms and if you don't fill them you basically
paying like like maybe up to 100 to 150 per room a con that i was violent told that that happened
its first year and it was kind of surprising they were able to bounce back with a uh year two so
that's i actually have known that from something else i'm working with on the side um that yeah
they're yeah the room guarantees and all that to to get the rates and all that yep that is very
true and that's something games done quick is going to have to figure out they're probably
going to have to pay it uh and and uh figure it out from their uh list viewership and maybe have
to have some fundraisers because you know they have they have their channel they run that channel
most of the time and it's not always for charity so they might run their own kind of fundraisers
to sort of you know fundraise to run the funds they like cover that stuff so they don't go
bankrupt i'm sure people would be more than willing to jump in i'm sure they will i'm sure
they will well that happened to magfest a couple of years back they they cancelled magfest paid
off the cancellation fees and had a telethon made and made the money back yeah so i'm sure
games done quick could do the same easy and and lastly there was something else but i totally
forgot but that's just how my my memory is got the retention of a goldfish sometimes but um i
kind of want to jump back to what you're talking about dragon con and the conventions and so forth
you know there are times when i have to deal with people like that in my own circles i just
want to just shake them if not shake them slap some sense into them what people don't understand
is that if a con cancels they got to pay all these fees out and sometimes they don't have
to depending on you know the local ordinances about covet and so forth and once we get past that
you have cons are like okay we're gonna do our thing but you gotta follow these rules you have
to mask up and all this and so forth and there are people that will push back and i remember
one of my favorite conventions i was actually getting into a pissing fight with somebody over
this and the people that run the convention messaged me begging me to stop and walk away
this one person was demanding that the con go on she didn't care about wearing a mask because she
said she was dying anyway she just wanted to have a good time and i'm just like who hurt you
you know that's and that's why that's why i don't fault dragon con or any con for what happened
number one i knew what situation i was working walking into number two my understanding is they
tried and what happened is that people were basically fighting with them those are the people
that i blame like but rob let me say this you didn't walk into anything you went in full well
knowing what was going on and you followed the protocols so that's what you did that was that's
perfectly fine indeed you do that not just for personal when you go out you do this for work i
mean they just said on the subways you do not have to wear a mask oh i saw that yeah i wear a
mask because you know what i don't trust half these people out here i'm just like no no i know
people who have caught covid like three four times and it freaks me out i'm just saying i've been a
lot i rode it i rode the atlanta subway on tuesday while i was apparently now now that i know i'm
such a while i was contagious those folks should be thanking me for wearing a mask honestly so
no i don't i don't need a medal or a treat i had to do what i had to do to get home
but you know it's just kind of one of those like it's not hard to wear a mask
it's common sense and as i said before covid one of those things that actually scares me because
i have actually known people who are on the brink of death and just bounced back from it and i'm
just like you know and next weekend i'm going to a con with somebody she cannot be vaccinated
due to her medical condition and i got masks and everything and i'm just like
and i'm just hoping that she's she'll be fine through this and she's already survived a round
of covid so um that is uh yeah but it's interesting so you but you saying she's going to the con
anyway and i think there would be a lot of people out there that would like to tell her
don't do it but you know it's it's her decision it's her decision not yours and that's that's
that's what was making me angry earlier right but the thing is she'll be wearing a mask so there's
that now it'd be a different story like there are some conventions that are like they they're
there are some cons where it's like you must have your your shots you must have your booster
and you must show proof of a negative test like 24 hours before the con you know and there are
people that argue that and yes there are those conventions that have that restrictive rules
it still happens but i always argue just wait just wait so everything is said and done you
count the numbers because of how strict they were the numbers on that's going to be very low and
and that's all that really matters i mean hell i went to a con a year and a half ago and i refused
to support them because they had a covid scare they they actually put that someone may have
tested positive and an email blast they sent out congratulating the winners of a raffle they put
that at the bottom and then i found out the next day they posted on their social medias
i i was just absolutely freaked yes it was a thin chance i caught it but it's just how they handled
the situation and then i found that one of my friends who's a voice actor in the industry
was a guest at that con and they never told him oh wow so that's yeah and i know i know i know
you were saying that like the convention sort of you know had a responsibility to tell people and
so forth i i also have to say that rama like i i don't necessarily disagree like at least
it would have been in their best interest to at least put out a tweet that said hey we had
a lot of people here this weekend you know you should follow these you know covid things for
safety or you should get a test and know your status or whatever like that would have been
really nice i think it would be a good thing however there it it's also necessary to put
some fucking accountability on the attendees you went to a convention that was intended by thousands
and thousands of people if you don't think you were exposed to covid i i i don't i don't know
there are some common sense things i don't know how to explain to people but also there's a
financial aspect of it like some of the hotels don't want to push back because these people will
cancel their rooms and that's less money coming in that weekend and given how the economy is you know
you gotta take take the hits where you can without being knocked out which i do understand to a
certain extent i'm one of those it's like if that if i'm running the place if that means y'all don't
show up and i lose their type of money that's fine the liability has dropped a lot at the end
of the day i will count my blessings count the money and see if we can do something next year
or if i'm running the hotel see we see if we can continue to keep the people on staff to keep the
hotel open you know i i'm sorry there no you're not wrong but there is an important element of
dragon con you have to remember um with those hotels and that is that there is a lot going on
in atlanta on labor day and even though i can't imagine being in that hotel and not being at
dragon con there are people that go to those hotels that are staying there for the football
games that are happening in town this weekend and guess who the crowd is that doesn't want to
wear the fucking mask around the hotel and the hotel doesn't want to be the bad guy
there have been times where odor con has happened and right across from the bc i mean from the
convention center you you have a bunt you have camden yards so they're so those people are coming
out seeing us running around in fabrics are like who are those freaks mind you we see them wearing
sports attire and they're painted up and we're like who are those weirdos you know
well i'm just glad things are starting to get better not at the rate that it should be but
at least we're getting somewhere you know at least the the evolutions of the virus seem to
be getting weaker and that's you know we just have to hope it keeps going in that direction
like i said earlier this last week has not been pleasant do not let me try to make it sound like
covid was a pleasant experience the second time or into that stuff no it sucked you do not want this
however swine flu was worse like i said that was i was worse i was i i remember one night when i
had swine flu i was like this is it this is the end that i mean i i laugh now but it wasn't funny
then so uh i i i i it hasn't been as bad as that but ev your mileage may vary look i got a friend
who caught covid back in december it's been nine months she still has a lingering cough so
yeah to i'll say this and i'm gonna get out of here for the night because i gotta prep for work
tomorrow and all that to paraphrase chris frock you know i don't one day we get to the point where
you've heard to your friend you're like how are you doing that man i don't know man yeah i'm all
right yo my cove has been acting up but i tell you what i took some testing last night and i'm feeling
great you know i hope we eventually get to that point where you know a little bit of tussle noodle
or something to put long covid in check right yeah yeah so all right take care of my friend
thank you for calling it's always good to hear from you no problem y'all take care and see you
on the flip side all right bye-bye anime jam session listen to it all right uh if you want
to give us a call vog network.com and you can join the green room and uh we'll get to that
vognetwork.com discord that is um i didn't check with loki to see if there's any last minute stories
uh yes there was there was a leak apparently um for blizzard's new overwatch 2 hero
uh kuriko i guess it was going to be a support character got accidentally leaked it is mentioned
in the season one premium battle pass um documented or it's like the description for that
which i don't know if they they've pulled that down or not but they actually have like
i think video or screenshots of the hero uh who has cat ears so um
yeah they're not too happy about that she's gonna be a support character i think i don't
remember oh she's a teleporting fox girl
sorry i just realized i was muted while i was typing um that sounds like it could be fun
ever everybody loves a cat girl and a fox girl right of course yeah they said it was uploaded
to a spanish um or uploaded in spanish it was an animated short for the character
and it said with a still in progress render like tag on it so i'm
i probably shouldn't have been leaked out probably not um but hey it could be like street fighter
six and your entire roster could have already been leaked so there is that yeah things things
could always be a little worse right it'd be worse yeah all right um i want to see if we have any
tweets i know there was at least one i wanted to read because there was a follow-up to something
that had come up on a prior episode so i'm looking at twitter right now if you want to
follow us on twitter we actually we are lucky enough to have a three letter name it's o-l-r
on twitter you can't even get that anymore o-l-r uh and if you want to follow us uh on twitter you
sure can and you can send us tweets throughout the week uh such as a tweet that we got from
uh i'm having to scroll through some comments that i made on the marvel game ah here it is um
zeba uh had tweeted saying here is the vod of cirque's production of clue in final fantasy 14
they had some technical difficulties and the audio didn't record so they manually put in the
soundtrack there's no in-game sounds it's a bit weird but it's still great so that was a tweet uh
from zeba uh who who sent us that and i actually did so it was uh them doing clue and it was the
movie uh they did it in uh final fantasy 14 and it was pretty um it was pretty neat but
you could see where the technical limitations kind of unfortunately got in the way a little bit
because um they like like characters would pop in and out because there were too many people
that were in the zone and so they weren't able yeah it's so so like characters would kind of
like come and go and stuff like that i'm actually trying to see if i can bring it up here on the
other monitor uh for you all oops you don't necessarily need to have the full music from
the theme but there you go if you've never heard the music from clue let me see actually i really
want to kill that because that's probably copyright music sorry about that uh let me
go to the other screen here you can actually see so here's the production let me make that
filled to the page there so you could see there is and so you can kind of see how it starts but
then when you really get into like what's happening throughout the event like look at
like all of these people here and whoever's recording this has to get like right up next
to the dinner table to see what's going on and then in other places i want to do the scenes where
it's really cutting in and out i think that was right maybe more towards the beginning like you
could just see how many people are in there and it's kind of hard to see like well who's the
character speaking and what what's happening and characters kind of pop in and out really fast
but i loved if you actually read like what's going on with the script they actually
localized things to fit aorza and the final fantasy universe and i thought it was super
cute like what they were doing with that so it was clever and my honest suggestion would be
do a performance of this just for the vod like i i know that it's very attractive to do this in
game and get people to the house and all this type of stuff but do a performance for the vod
like you know and that whole thing and and really show off you know the talent that goes into it
without the technical problems of having people you know show up and stuff and some comments from
chat so as joan hunter matt says dinner theater fantasy style and dr cio says wow that's great
yeah like it's it's really clever and cool and unique and this is one of the those spontaneous
things that happens to mmos that i love um but just some of the technical issues of the game
aren't really prepared for it and that's a bummer all right well with that that was it for the
tweets tonight and we did not get any emails that participate at orangeslaunchradio.com
but i will invite you to send some for next week so again that's participate at
orangeslaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email i think that's going to do it for the show
my voice is about done with tonight as well so i think we're going to wrap up uh but let's go
around and get uh final thoughts and stuff uh before that i will say thank you as always for
listening to orange launch radio um if you enjoyed what you heard here please tell a friend about
the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice and
in order to get those voices out on air we need more people here a nice five-star review on a
site like itunes spotify or wherever you found this podcast that all goes an awful long way
super appreciate that before i get to my final thought i have to make sure we say this at some
point as well i know we've had a lot of um bummer news tonight and things in our lives that we're
dealing with and so forth but on a somewhat more positive note i should note the date is september
11th and no i'm not referring to historical events uh in a in a winsmick way that would be tacky i
am referring to the fact that september 11th happens to be loki's birthday it does happy
birthday loki thank you did you get to do anything for your day in spite of everything
that's going on i did nothing and it was everything i thought it would be is that a good
thing because sometimes doing nothing for your birthday is a good thing no i just worked on i
worked on my uh my build for um my next episode still well you had a productive day then that's
good yep that's what i've been trying to do i have to go back to work tomorrow which i don't want to
do but um yeah i did want to mention though that i will be uh i think channel 64 is doing her next
stream weekend on saturday okay so um i may be participating in that as well so just stay tuned
to uh twitter or my youtube channel probably we'll have uh the schedule for that well the least the
least you could do for loki's birthday everybody is follow him on his youtube and his twitch and
his socials so yes subscribe to the youtube channel if you're not already every little bit
helps loki olr right yes all right uh okay now that i finally got that out of my system i meant
to say it um earlier but you know we got in a uh debate about something else so um i want to make
sure we got that happy birthday out though it is important so uh do you have any final thoughts
for our folks tonight loki nope just uh i can't wait for the next episode to be done it well
hopefully be done this weekend but that's a lot of building i gotta do it's it's really big
but yeah it's really cool um i can't wait for you to see it uh and i i don't have a lot to say here
either just um you know i've said a lot earlier in the show i hope to get back into streaming on
my own this week you know i usually leave dragon con so motivated to stream again from all the
panels and things that i did so it really sucks that covet kind of put the brakes on that um
because i would have been right back into it this week but it didn't happen but i am hoping i'm
getting better enough especially from doing this show tonight and hopefully that continues tomorrow
although my number one onus right now needs to be taken care of alan and making sure he has all his
needs net but assuming that is all taken care of i will stream tomorrow i want to make sure i i do
that and kind of get back in the habit of that i have no idea what i'm going to play yet but i'll
play something um so yeah oh really quick quick i did want to mention since we didn't recover before
for the live folks who are watching on twitch the game behind me is called one dreamer is a game
that came out uh this week and it's like a i think it's a point click adventure game sort of where
you do coding in it as well i played the the demo a while back and it was pretty awesome i i'm
hoping to get a chance to play this the full game but apparently i think it was made by a single
person over the course of seven years so it's just it's about kind of i haven't played it all
the way but i think it's supposed to be about and it's probably going to ring true to a little bit
to me um about like indie game devs and like these projects that they kind of set aside for a long
time and going back to like finish them some type of things so i think that that's some of it but
yeah it's pretty cool you should go check it out sounds like it might hit close to home all right
that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio we'll be back in seven
days to do it again hopefully dark sakura is feeling up to joining us as well that week and
