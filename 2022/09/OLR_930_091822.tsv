0	14360	You know the Sims? And the current game in that series has just under $1000 of DLC? Now
14360	18980	you can get the base Sims 4 for free! Thanks EA! You finally understood where the money
18980	22400	is made and gave people the same thing that shareware of decades past did in order to
22400	28740	entice consumers and provide value. Generosity! Wow! This is one story that should have come
28740	32620	out years ago. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell
32620	35640	you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show
35640	37660	where every gamer has a voice.
37660	46220	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
46220	53420	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode
53420	61020	number 930 of our show for tonight September the 18th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and
61020	68780	I am joined with my co-hosts. Say hello and welcome back to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
68780	71220	Your hi didn't come through. You might be muted but how are you?
71220	72220	I'm not muted.
72220	74940	Now it came through. That was weird. Well, how are you?
74940	76940	My voice is still kind of messed up.
76940	79220	Well, I hope you are feeling better overall though.
80020	87940	I am for the most part. I'm on prednisone for my cough. One more week off of work. I
87940	99940	mean, it's, I'm getting bored. But I've got other stuff to be doing. But yeah, it's, it's,
99940	105460	yeah I just want the cough to go away and so far on my second day I've been pretty okay.
105460	109020	Just my voice is still trying to go out a little bit.
110020	114580	I mean, not your voice going out, but the cough is getting better. I talked a little bit on last
114580	120260	week's show about my own COVID troubles and luckily the cough for the most part has subsided. I still
120260	125060	hear Alan with it a little bit. But the interesting thing is we tested negative on the same day,
125060	129860	even though he didn't come down with COVID for about four or five days after me, but
129860	134100	he had Paxlevid. I didn't this time. So I think that helped.
134100	146460	So I, you know, in my case, I, we're not sure if my other issues extended it, or if it's considered,
146460	153500	you know, long COVID or not. So yeah, but I'm feeling better, which is good because, you know,
153500	159980	I've got TwitchCon coming up. Yeah, right. I'm like, well, at least I've gone through all that
160020	164740	before TwitchCon. I mean, I'd still like to get the shot, but I just, I have to talk to my doctor
164740	169140	about the timeframe. Of course I'm going to TwitchCon. Okay. I thought for some reason you
169140	173860	weren't and I, well, then I should have gotten a bigger hotel room for Disneyland on Monday.
173860	180020	Oh, well, we're flying. So we're flying back on Monday. So, because we, now, now we've missed
180020	184500	more work than either of us wanted to. So we don't want to extend the trip and we have, we're going
184540	191740	to Seattle in November. So there's, there's that we have as well. So yeah, I, my, my work takes
191740	198300	care of us for stuff like that. However long it takes to get better. That's good. So I can give
198300	206140	you more about that, but I've got a nice Airbnb with some of the other Twitch folks. Yeah, like
206860	214460	staying with Intoxicated and Fluffy and Deez Nuts. I'm sorry, you're friends with Deez Nuts?
214500	219380	Is that what you're saying here? Yes. All right. Is Deez Nuts your bestie?
221380	226420	We, we know each other. You, you, you're, you're pretty fond of Deez Nuts is what you're saying.
229620	236580	Look, you set it up. I took the shot. All right. Well, and also Cup of Jojo. I don't know if you've
236580	242660	ever. Yeah, I do recognize some of these names. I do. Yeah. All right. It's going to be a big
242660	248820	reunion there. Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki. Hello. You had me worried there
248820	252260	for a minute. I thought behind you, that was the footage we were going to talk about at the top of
252260	256500	the show tonight, but no, I recognize the characters. That's actually Grand Theft Auto 5.
256500	267220	I would never do that. Leak footage on the air. Who would do that? Me? No, but take two,
267220	272100	you know, is going to go hog wild with those takedowns. So obviously we will not be doing
272100	276100	any of that here tonight because we like our show to be able to be viewed in the archive.
276740	281140	But there's nothing wrong with showing Grand Theft Auto 5, a fine, a fine game,
281140	287540	in the Grand Theft Auto series. A game of all time. It is a game. Yes. Well, shoot, I guess I
287540	290980	kind of gave away what we're going to talk about at the top of the show here. We do talk about
290980	294740	video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. We do it live every Sunday night,
294740	299380	nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash
299380	305380	vog network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And, uh, you know, contrary to last week,
305380	310340	last week was a little bit slower in the news department. This week we had Tokyo game show.
310340	315300	So we've got a Nintendo direct to talk about. We've got a PlayStation direct to talk about.
315300	319380	We've got, um, other news that came out of Tokyo game show to talk about. Like there's,
319380	325620	there's no shortage of news this week. And then this morning, huge bombshell in the industry
325700	331380	drops. Um, yeah, Loki, you're, you're the fan here on this program of this series.
331380	344180	Tell us what went down. So, um, a user by the name of, uh, teapot Uber hacker, um, posted a link to,
344980	351060	um, it was a telegram download for 90 videos that they quote unquote,
351620	359060	goal from rock stars, um, from an employee Slack account. Um, this is also apparently the same
359060	365780	individual who hacked, um, Uber recently as well. And so on top of this, they say they,
365780	372660	they had 90 plus video clips from the game in development, uh, debug code or with the
372660	379060	debug code and stuff. They also said they had, I think the source for GTA five and I think for
379060	389300	sex as well. Um, so I mean, I'm not just gonna not download that. So, uh, I watched all of the
389300	394100	videos. Look, here's the thing. We're not going to play it here on the show, but you have social
394100	398740	media, you have a Twitter account. It's very easy to search to look at this and like, like, look
398740	405140	again, I think it's unfortunate this happened to rock star, but how am I going to not see it when
405140	410340	this is huge gaming news going on today in the industry? Can I just say this though, for what
410340	414900	it's worth? I mean, it sucks that rock star was robbed of a moment and the employees that have
414900	418980	been working on the game have been robbed of this. I, and I know gamers are always going to have
418980	424660	something to say and commentary, even though so many of them that do commentation on this industry
424660	429620	have no idea what they're talking about and what goes into actually making a game. But can I say
429780	435300	so like, Oh, how is this game using reused assets from grand theft auto five? Because that's what
435300	439460	every game does early in development. I don't think it is using reused assets from somebody
439460	445460	called that out on Twitter and was right through the coals out for it. But here's the thing is that
445460	450820	I actually thought it looked really good. I was like the graphics in this game are incredible.
450820	457700	This looks like this really looks next gen. So the rumor is the story supposed to take place
457780	465060	around these two main characters, Jason Lucia. So we have a female main protagonist in the game as
465060	471060	well. And it's supposed to be like a Bonnie and Clyde type story. So much like you can play three
471060	474580	different characters in five, it looks like you can at least play through two characters right
474580	481300	now. Like literally literally the opening scene in Pulp Fiction is what it is. Yeah, they had they
481300	488260	had a good scene where they were robbing a a fast food place and it kind of showed off some of the
488260	495460	stuff there most of the video because I watched all 90 of them. So most of the video they weren't
495460	502340	very long. Most of the video was just animation tests. So it's like testing animation blending
502340	507220	looks like they have a brand new animation system that's working with the game itself. So
507780	510980	you know, for different character aiming and stuff, it's gonna be very,
512740	519140	very dynamic the way it looks like it works like they have like different points of the body that
519140	524020	are kind of, you know, facing different directions and blending together and all that kind of stuff.
524020	530420	So there's a lot of tests regarding that. There was footage of like, it's basically just it's a
530420	536020	lot of debug stuff. It's either they're taking, you know, video footage of like, here's a bug
537140	544020	to here's some video footage of us testing this system and stuff. So it was kind of interesting
544020	550420	to see all that kind of behind the scenes stuff. I mean, obviously a lot of this is not close to
550420	556180	being finished, but it is pretty polished from what we've seen so far. There are a lot of
556180	560820	placeholder things like you could see some buildings that don't have the date like they've
560820	566020	I mean, it makes sense because you don't put those those checkerboard those checkerboard
566020	571940	textures that you always see in test. Yeah, that that's a test levels that they put in there to
571940	578500	test animations. They have a vehicle test level to test, you know, vehicle physics and whatnot.
578500	583460	And they have like different materials and they're testing just all they have, you know, stuff for
583460	590340	that. And then there's the main world that they're kind of testing stuff in as well. And I mean,
590340	594740	it looks pretty polished, but they've still got, you know, obviously there's placeholder buildings
594740	600820	and stuff in there where the details aren't necessarily there, which is fine. I mean, that
600820	606660	and the character models, there's a lot of like temporary character models that they're just using
606660	610900	it for, you know, kind of testing the mission scripting and all that stuff because all that
610900	614820	stuff comes like last like all of the polish and stuff on there.
614820	619140	And so some folks pointing out in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network,
619140	623780	SSG100 Matt says it's two year old alpha footage, it's going to be totally different and probably
623780	628660	already totally different. Not all of it is. Some of it is taken down and I want to see it.
628660	633300	Just so just search for GTA six, but use the Roman numeral six leaks on Twitter
633300	638260	and like go sort by recent. And you'll see videos as they come up.
639060	643220	It's a lot of it because all the files were dated. So I don't know if they're all from the
643220	649460	same builds, but based off of the build information that's in there, you can see which version of
649460	654420	Windows is running on. So some of them are from earlier. We'll just from a little bit earlier
654420	660820	this year. If the file names are to be believed, some of them are within like a few days ago.
661300	670020	Oh, and upwards to I think 20 like 2019 or 2020 is how far back they go. But it you can obviously
670020	673300	tell like from just some of the stuff that they're testing, like some of it's just like basic
673860	680020	animation things. Some of it now is more, you know, does the animation look correctly for
680020	685620	shooting out of a window? No, this is my character. You turn correctly, is it not look all
685620	691940	janky and that type of stuff. So they they're doing more of the complex stuff now to get that
691940	697380	going. But you can see their mission creation stuff. You know, a lot of it obviously is a huge
697380	703460	peak behind the curtain for better or for worse, right? It's a huge peak. It's still probably a
703460	710420	ways off. I think I think it's probably at least in the next year, not the year after by by this.
711060	716340	But it looks really good. That's the pre alpha stuff looks better than Saints Row.
717540	722100	I know. I think this might surprise you in some way that we're saying this. And again,
722100	727620	I'm not advocating what happened. It sucks that this happened. The fact of the matter is once on
727620	730740	the internet, always on the internet. So now that I've looked at the footage, I am like,
730740	736180	actually, it looks really good. Like the graphics look incredible. And I don't usually super get
736180	740740	into these games. But I've been trying I'll get into it in my gaming week. I've been trying a lot
740740	745780	of new shoes on the feet this week, thanks to things like game pass. And I got to admit,
745780	752980	I'm kind of interested in this. So for what it's worth, you won me over even though it was not
752980	758420	intended this way. And I'm sure that the actual polished trailer will be even more hype. But it's
758420	763620	interesting. Right. And the game, you know, for those who aren't familiar is going to take place
763620	770820	in Vice City, as was rumored to be the case. And it looks good. I mean, it looks good so far. Like
770820	777780	they certainly haven't shied away from all of like the lewd stuff like Saints Row did Saints Row was
777780	782660	like, we can't put any of this inappropriate stuff in there. It's just ridiculous. But we're
782660	787700	going to murder a ton of people. Whereas they're like, you know, there's a strip club scene in this
787700	794340	footage already. Like so it's it's like, I'm glad Grand Theft Auto is just Grand Theft Auto,
794340	799940	honestly, like they had some NPC dialogue, you know, this guy like spouting off all this like
799940	806900	QAnon, like conspiracy theory nonsense, you know, you're talking about like social media companies
806900	811060	trying to track your every movement and stuff like that. But it's all in game stuff. Obviously,
811060	814980	you know, they're talking about life life hacker and stuff like that, which is I think their
814980	822820	Facebook. It's just, I don't know, it's funny, it's it would be, I am very much looking forward
822820	828740	to a new Grand Theft Auto. Yeah, the story campaign. I am not looking forward to a Grand
828740	836900	Theft Auto online too, which will just be melt to death with microtransactions. But the stories are
836900	841380	always very good. I want to come back to Grand Theft Auto online in a minute because people say
841380	845780	this is actually the most damning part of the leak like whatever the Grand Theft Auto six part,
845780	849620	they'll recover from this. I mean, it sucks that they got the wind knocked out of it a little bit
849620	854260	with their big announcement everything but like, remember Half Life 2, like the entire source code
854260	859300	for that game leaked before it came out and that game ended up doing just fine. And I think Grand
859300	863460	Theft Auto six is going to be just fine. But let's talk about Grand Theft Auto online in a moment. I
863460	867860	want to get some more comments from the chat over twitch.tv slash vog network. Quest Buster says the
867860	872100	dev and debug panels were visible in the footage I saw like the holdup scene there was a lot of
872100	877140	placeholder code pinging reactions, behaviors, etc, with a bunch of dummies filling in. There
877140	882340	were also voice acting already implemented for the scene, which was surprising. It may be less
882340	888100	surprising if they actually mocap to the actors performing it as was what they did in Red Dead
888100	892420	Redemption, which you know, I kind of learned a lot more about thanks to Dragon Con and interviewing
892420	896420	the folks behind it that actually may have been one of the first things they did. It could be that
896420	901300	the main actors are actually motion captured like they were in Red Dead. I don't know. Loki is does
901300	906260	that seem like probably yes, it will be the case because that's how they did five. So it's not
906260	910980	they're going to do this until they did read it. And so that has to come first and then they add
910980	916020	everything in around it basically. And that's why the placeholder, you know, people in the diner and
916020	920340	stuff are probably not actually mocapped. And so they're they're getting added in and they're at a
920340	925940	different stage. So other comments in chat as to 100 Matt says the problem this is going to cause
926020	930020	not just would take to stock will take a hit tomorrow. But also the employees will be under
930020	934820	a lot of scrutiny now work from home arrangements may be revisited for some folks video and
934820	940100	screenshots not shared in slack probably this leak is going to make stabs lies very difficult. Yeah,
940100	948580	that's a very realistic look at the situation. I mean, with what minimal we've heard about how this
948580	955300	leak happened. I heard in there. It came from an employee's slack account. So one of two things
955300	960500	happen. And I think one is far more likely than the other one. You have a disgruntled employee.
960500	965700	I think that's the less likely one. Yeah, because just people are going to be afraid of this
965700	970740	contracts because yeah, the guy that basically said they hacked this did the same thing to Uber
970740	978900	in the same, you know, method to infiltrate it was social, social engineering. So she get the
978900	983940	credentials for an employee's slack account, and then downloading the information based off that
983940	990420	and see. I mean, I don't, I don't understand slack too much. But like, why is your source
990420	996820	code for your game linked in your slack account? Like, well, I mean, like the full back it up,
996820	1003700	it probably opened the door to being able to from slack, get other credentials to log into place.
1003700	1006500	Like I don't think the source code was just sitting there on slack. I think there were
1006500	1010660	other credentials, as that person was going through the different chat rooms and so forth,
1010660	1015700	probably found maybe an internal leak. Maybe it turned out the person's slack login was also
1015700	1018900	some type of intranet login. Like there's a million things that could have happened
1018900	1023300	that I think it was, I don't think it's like the source code was just posted there to pin post on
1023300	1029860	slack. It's not that, but I think it was the first, first breadcrumb to get to that stuff
1029860	1035540	is what it was. I think that's how it happened. And my question is, if it was social engineering,
1035540	1040740	where the hell was two factor authentication? I realize there are very sophisticated ways to get
1040740	1046580	around that nowadays. So I guess it could have been there, but I would say if two factor auth
1046580	1052740	wasn't enabled and mandated for everybody, it sure will be tomorrow. And quite honestly,
1053460	1058420	even if you're not at take two, two factor authentication is going to be mandatory for
1058420	1063300	you in the next couple of weeks, if not already. At my work, you can't get into anything without
1063300	1068660	being on a specific VPN. Yeah. Yeah. Now Bobby Black Wolf does point out, and yes, I do. I'm not
1068660	1073140	a complete dummy. I know that there are ways around two factor authentication.
1073140	1077460	So Bobby Black Wolf says grabbing session tokens gets around two factor auth. I do know that,
1077460	1084900	but haven't we heard way too much in the news? Like this is how in politics, do you remember
1084900	1091620	the whole Democrat email server breach and this whole thing? That was all a targeted phishing
1091620	1097780	social, it was all that. And the person did not have two factor authentication because it wasn't
1097780	1102660	required for whatever reason, and they got in there. So this type of stuff unfortunately
1102660	1109060	happens a lot, even without two factor auth. And somebody probably didn't realize, oh, we probably
1109060	1113140	need this on Slack as well because all these breadcrumbs lead these different directions.
1113140	1118420	Again, I'm not the hacker, so I don't know how they did it, but based on the limited information
1118420	1124180	we have, I don't see how it's not this one way or the other. And now this is the part that
1124180	1130180	has to be looked at is how are people logging into these applications like Slack or Microsoft
1130180	1135940	Teams, whatever it is, what kind of information is being put on these things? That's the stuff
1135940	1140260	that's really going to be under a microscope, I think in the coming weeks, no matter where you're
1140260	1148820	at, especially at Take-Two, but has this been unique to Take-Two either? No. But what about
1148820	1155220	Capcom? Remember that just happened not that long ago, and I bet it was a very similar sort of thing,
1155220	1161860	and so on and so on. So anyway, I wanted to talk a little bit about the Grand Theft Auto Online and
1161860	1168580	the source code leaking for that. Loki, people are saying that that could bring Grand Theft
1168580	1175540	Auto Online to its knees. What's your takeaway on that? Probably not. I don't think it will.
1175540	1180900	If anything, it'll just help with cheat making and stuff like that, but I don't think it will.
1181620	1186900	And also at this point, if the new game's coming out and there's going to be a new
1186900	1191060	Grand Theft Auto Online anyways, I don't think it's going to matter. Well, but that thing's
1191060	1194980	still a cash cow and has to pay to keep the lights on for the next two years while they
1194980	1199620	polish Grand Theft Auto 6. But I'm not saying Grand Theft Auto Online is going to suddenly
1199620	1206740	shut down. I mean, worst case scenario, question mark, everybody has to download a new client to
1206740	1212020	log in. Like they could do some major patches to the client to try to patch out whatever they come
1212020	1218900	up with. But that could be a huge undertaking in a lot of hours that I'm not sure the company wants
1218900	1223620	to put onto Grand Theft Auto Online. Well, despite what I don't like with Grand Theft Auto Online
1223620	1230900	and the way that Rockstar Games handles things, I do the one positive upside you could take from
1230900	1235300	that is like with the source code leaking for Grand Theft Auto Online, that means that when
1235300	1241380	they do shut down Grand Theft Auto Online, someone will be able to create dummy servers
1241380	1246340	for Grand Theft Auto Online to be able to continue that on afterwards. So it is good for video
1246340	1251940	game preservation in that sense. But I mean, it's already a hacker mess anyways,
1251940	1256420	and Grand Theft Auto Online anyways, from what I understand, though, I don't see how this is
1256420	1263140	any different. All right, I heard something about that Grand Theft Auto 5 source code already went
1263140	1267700	for like $100,000 or something like that on the dark web or whatever you want to call it.
1267700	1272500	Ah, yeah, whatever that means. Yeah. But, you know, as again, pointed out in chat by
1272500	1276420	Quest Buster, and I said it earlier, remembers when the Half Life 2 source code was leaked,
1276420	1281220	like so you know, again, Grand Theft Auto 6 is still going to sell 11 billion copies.
1281220	1288500	The reality is most people, most people buying that game aren't checking gaming news on Twitter
1288500	1293860	regularly. That's the fact of the matter. Most people that are buying these games are not the
1293860	1299860	people that are tuned into looking at leaks and that sort of stuff. And even if they did, again,
1300500	1306340	I would think most people are going to be like, wow, that looks pretty good. But I guess there's,
1306340	1310100	you know, gamers are going to be gamers sometimes and everybody's going to have a criticism. But
1310180	1313460	I mean, understanding that this is still in development stuff,
1313460	1318340	you know, the stuff that I saw, I was like, wow, okay, now I see why this game is taking forever.
1318340	1323140	To be honest, like, I'm like, okay, yeah, like, this is definitely like next level graphic stuff.
1323140	1326660	And I can say this is taking a very long time. I think they're claiming that they're not going
1326660	1332100	to be crunching their employees, which is why it's been developed over however many years.
1332100	1337860	Yeah. I mean, let's be honest, like, they're making billions of dollars off of Grand Theft
1337860	1345220	Auto, like each year. So they have the resources to be able to not stress their employees and to
1345220	1349620	be able to pay them for the long haul to develop a great game. Like, so there's absolutely no
1349620	1353780	excuses like, well, we, we had to get it out early because we just didn't have the funding.
1354500	1359300	No, you have so much money. Like, it's just not even a problem. Yeah.
1360260	1364100	All right. Well, we'll see what develops tomorrow is going to be I mean, the bummer,
1364100	1368100	quote unquote, is that for the live folks, we kind of have to wait for tomorrow to see what
1368100	1372580	Take Two's official response really is. And I bet the lawyers are going to be out there in mass,
1372580	1376100	shutting down the footage the best they can. I'm sure they're already on it.
1376100	1378980	You know, once on the internet, always on the internet, it's a very hard thing to-
1378980	1379780	The post is gone.
1379780	1380740	What's that?
1380740	1381860	The forum post is gone.
1381860	1389620	Oh, yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. So I, you know, all that. Bobby in a chat reposting a Twitter joke.
1390180	1394260	Breaking news, police have arrested the man suspected of stealing the GTA source code.
1394260	1399140	However, he immediately respond outside the police station. Yes, yes. Well, but you know,
1399140	1404340	if this person is caught, if this person is caught, they, I mean, that's what ended up
1404340	1410660	ultimately happening with the Half-Life 2, if I remember right, is the guy had the gall to contact
1410660	1417940	Gabe Newell looking for a job and ended up getting arrested by like, it was either the FBI or the
1417940	1422740	German version of it because I believe the guy was in Germany or, you know, again, this was a
1422740	1428580	long time ago. My memory is a little rusty, but he was arrested by authorities somewhere on his way
1428580	1432820	to go talk to Gabe Newell about getting a job when I think Gabe Newell had planned to turn him
1432820	1439620	in himself. So if this person does get caught, if, there could be harsh penalties. Of course,
1440500	1445540	if this person is in certain countries where they're not going to extradite and they're not
1445540	1453220	going to give a shit, then it's not going to matter. So we'll see. Let's see. Let's see.
1453860	1456980	Dang, there's one other thing I wanted to say on that. Oh, well, it'll come back to me later,
1456980	1461860	I'm sure. But I'm also looking at chat. Zen Monkey says, I was thinking he was just a fellow gamer
1461860	1468740	looking to keep your Anthototo online after the server shut down. We'll see. It could have been
1468740	1475220	somebody, you know, because if I recall correctly, it was either the Witcher 3 source code or the
1475460	1480660	Cyberpunk source code. Somebody bought that with the intent to give it back to CD Projekt Red.
1480660	1485220	They bought it with the intent to keep it offline. So I'm not saying that happened here,
1485220	1490500	but it may have been a, I don't know what you would call it, a white knight or something,
1490500	1497620	a knight in shining armor. The name escapes me, but somebody tried to do a good thing,
1497620	1501460	basically, for the company. So we'll see. You mean like a Good Samaritan?
1501460	1506260	Yeah, Good Samaritan. That's it. Thank you. Trying to do this, you know, but that's a lot
1506260	1513300	of money to be in a Good Samaritan. All right. Anyhow, we'll see what Monday's response looks
1513300	1516820	like. For those on the podcast feed, by the time you're hearing this, you'll probably already hear
1516820	1521540	some stuff from Take Two, and I'd be very curious to see, you know, what they're going to say about
1521540	1526420	it. I'm not sure there's a lot they can, except emphasizing that they really frown on this being
1526420	1532340	shared, that it is early in development, and we look forward to showing you an official look,
1532340	1538100	a polished look at Grand Theft Auto 6 very soon. I'm not sure there's a lot they can say outside
1538100	1543060	of that. All right, let's talk about the games we have been playing this week in a segment called
1543060	1546740	How Is Your Gaming Week that we do here every week, and Dark Sakura, let's go to you. How
1546740	1553060	is your gaming week? Of course, I've been playing Dead by Daylight. I also watched the Light in the
1553060	1561540	Fog tourney. That was pretty fun. I have been playing Cold to the Lamb. Final Fantasy IV,
1561540	1567780	I got back to last night. I'm close to beating the game, so I'm either going to do Final Fantasy V or
1567780	1575380	Star Ocean next. I haven't decided. I think I'm going to do V. Wordscapes have been playing,
1575380	1582740	Patterned again, because they put out an update for Patterned today. I had something else that's
1582900	1588260	on. Oh, yeah, and I'm going to be starting Avengers, I think, when I'm done with Cold
1588260	1596820	to the Lamb. Nice. Playing through Stadia again. Nice. By the way, weren't you, I forgot to ask
1596820	1600820	you before we were on air, so sorry to spring this on you, but did you still do that other
1600820	1606740	show today? Did you want to give it a plug? I did. I did do the interview for Stadia dosage,
1607620	1615860	and I believe it will be live on Tuesday. I'll be given a link soon as to when it will be on,
1615860	1626260	but it's going to be reposted on YouTube, so look for Stadia dosage. I had just the best time
1627620	1633940	talking to MM2K, who has also been a long-time listener of us. Oh, that's great. Yeah, and it
1633940	1640420	was a really good experience. We basically went way off the rails about different topics,
1640420	1646820	because I think we're both fairly passionately opinionated people, and we talked about the
1646820	1656020	state of gaming, and about people needing to know their roots, and shaking our canes at the kids on
1656020	1666260	our lawn. Just the difference that Stadia has made to us, and especially for me, being a Mac gamer,
1667140	1673620	Stadia has been the way I get to play some of these things, because of incompatibility with
1673620	1683620	the ARM environment for Windows. There's been some of that going on. Still trying to get me to play
1683620	1694820	Division, and I don't think I'm going to, but we'll see. We talked for, gosh, maybe three and
1694820	1703220	a half hours, including the interview. We could have gone more, but I was losing my voice.
1704020	1712900	So it was a really great experience. I'm looking forward. I don't like to listen to my
1712900	1719220	voice, as I know that you know, especially right now, since I sound like I've been swallowing gravel.
1721540	1728020	But I'm thinking it's going to be pretty good. We went over some pretty big
1728580	1738580	stuff too, just in terms of why 60 frames per second on games is going to be the max
1739380	1747860	that would be, what's the word I'm thinking of, perceptible by human eyes, outside of going into
1750100	1755220	long exposures and things, and doing multiple frames in slow-mo, and various.
1755940	1766980	Like, I know we were talking about CRTs, and why a 60 frames per second game played on a CRT isn't
1766980	1774820	going to make a big difference, as it would be on a nice LCD screen, about pixel size, scan refresh,
1775460	1786100	that type of thing. We went into color theory, and just talking about the differences between
1786100	1792420	the games that we used to play, and the games we're playing now, and updating them, and various,
1792420	1801700	and talked about, great, my brain just blanked. I was just saying, it sounds like it'll be a
1801700	1810900	good interview. Is the Stadia dosage, is that a podcast or a YouTube thing?
1812980	1818820	It's a podcast, but I think you also, if you go to stadiodosage.com, I'll put a link in the chat,
1819700	1821860	there is how you get to everything.
1822580	1823460	Nice, okay.
1823460	1836900	And yeah, it's really good. He's got some blog content on there too.
1838500	1847140	There's videos for the show and everything. So I think, I know it's on YouTube, and I'm sorry,
1848100	1854740	he didn't actually say that there's content on Stitcher and a few others. So
1855860	1857700	I think the audio is recapped.
1857700	1862420	Stitcher is just a podcast app. So yeah, I'm sure it's, that's cool. Great. All right.
1864020	1873220	I'm pretty excited about some of the stuff happening in the Stadiaverse.
1873940	1880260	All right. Well, we'll check in on the show later this week, it sounds like. All right. Well,
1880260	1883060	if that's it for your gaming week, let's go over to Loki. How was your gaming week?
1884180	1891220	It was all Minecraft again. Still working on my big build. So it is going to be the biggest
1891220	1896580	build I've ever done. So until you decide next time, I want to go even bigger.
1896580	1899460	Yep. Until next time.
1901060	1907220	Perfect. All right. Well, that's short and sweet. All right. My gaming week,
1907220	1911700	a lot of the same type of stuff. Still been playing Final Fantasy 14. My island sanctuary
1911700	1917540	is up to level nine. So I'm almost max level in the casual mini game, but I love the island
1917540	1921620	sanctuary stuff. It's very, I like to just sit there and gather while I either like watch Twitch
1921620	1926500	channels or YouTubes or whatever. So that's been very, very good to pass the time. So still playing
1926500	1933060	Final Fantasy 14. I finished the story patch content a long time ago. I don't really do
1933060	1938660	Savage rating. I don't really have the time or group to commit to it. So I just kind of take
1938660	1942740	the content that's there. I'm still really looking forward to the mid patch because it's supposed to
1942740	1947620	add in like a new type of endless dungeon sort of thing. So I'm really curious to see what that's
1947620	1952820	all about. So that'll be coming soon-ish. Otherwise, I've also been playing Diablo 3
1952820	1958180	and a lot of it. In fact, I've hit the point. My character is now Paragon, I think 730.
1958180	1964180	I think I hit. Now, the interesting thing about that, my non-seasonal Paragon or my
1964180	1971540	non-seasonal character is Paragon 715. What that means, anytime you beat a season, all of the XP
1971540	1976340	just dumps into your non-season characters. So what that means, right now in season 27,
1976340	1983860	that started a few weeks ago, I have more XP than my entire career over the last 10 years combined.
1984740	1991540	Now, I know, right? But here's some things to keep in mind. It's not exactly a one for one because
1991540	1998820	as these seasons keep going, they add new things so that you can progress farther into deeper rifts
1998820	2005940	where you get more XP. So I would say it's easier now to do a Torment 16 is no big deal
2006020	2011940	when the game used to cap out at Torment 6 and the greater rifts you could do were only so good
2011940	2016980	after that. So they've added things like ancients, primal ancients, and now there's this whole
2016980	2023300	arcane dust thing that they're doing in the recent season. So it's not quite one for one,
2023300	2027780	but still, I was pretty impressed to think like, wow, I have more XP on this character in five
2027780	2035380	weeks than my entire previous career. It's pretty something. I've also been playing Dead by Daylight
2035380	2039620	as well. I was playing on stream with some friends on Friday. I think once again, Dark
2039620	2044660	Sakura, I went and I checked back later and you had taken my place. I think they'd cycled a few
2044660	2049220	people through, but you had taken my place, so to speak, on a Taze Friday stream and that cracked me
2049220	2053460	up. So I hope you guys are having fun. I did come in when there were only three people in there and
2053460	2057140	I was joking, let me play with you. And I was like, no, I'm actually, I just got home and I'm
2057140	2060580	kind of tired. And he's like, actually, if you want to join in on the next round, I'm like, okay.
2061140	2066180	Nice. I don't know how it went for you. We had some really good matches. Like,
2066180	2072980	we escaped almost every time except for the last match I played, the killer decided to tunnel me
2072980	2076260	out, which- We had some really stinky people. Yeah.
2076260	2080900	I mean, but I don't know if you saw the screenshot that I put up on my Twitter
2081620	2086420	of us both slugged on Freddy's dirty mattress. Oh, Lord.
2086740	2094020	Yeah, it was, you know, and we were having fun. I mean, it was always a fun time. I like to,
2094660	2099780	you know, I've decided, it's just something for myself, that if I'm in a match with a stinky
2099780	2102420	person, the moment I realize they're stinky, I'm going to fuck with them.
2102980	2106660	Yeah. I mean, you know, and people, you know, I get asked this sometimes, like,
2106660	2110340	why do you keep playing that game when you talk about how terrible a lot of the players are?
2110340	2113620	Because you know what, when you are playing with friends or even if you're just, it is a lot of
2114500	2118820	fun. Like, it's just, you know what, because the match is over in 15, 20 minutes, and then you
2118820	2121460	move on to the next match and it's whatever. Exactly.
2121460	2122820	Yeah. Well, there's some people,
2122820	2128660	though, who don't let themselves get over it and are just, I don't know.
2128660	2132740	That's why I love this new anonymous mode. So people only, because, so they added a new thing
2132740	2135460	in the last patch where, you already know this, but I'm explaining for the listeners,
2136180	2140740	where you can replace your name with the name of the character you're playing. So for example,
2140740	2145220	if I'm playing Chris Redfield, then my name just shows as Chris Redfield, like 02 or 03,
2145220	2150420	whatever player number slot I'm in. So the other players, they can, they can talk all the smack
2150420	2153380	they want, but that's it. They got to leave it in the match because there's no way to find me
2153380	2159140	afterwards. So it's that, you know. Well, but even on top of that though,
2159140	2167300	I mean, it's just, it does get on, on you after you've had stink after stink after stink, you
2167300	2176500	know? And I've really just been trying to, you know, put myself a little bit past it,
2177220	2184420	you know, like, okay, so they're a piece of shit. Great. I don't have to dwell on it.
2184420	2190500	Once the game is over, they don't exist in my universe. That's what I'm trying to do.
2191140	2197860	You know, if it's bad enough, then maybe I will, you know, submit a, uh, you know, uh,
2198500	2203460	a video or, or something, you know, and then certainly not going to not talk about it.
2204260	2210580	You know, I want to make sure that they, cause like there were these people the other day who
2210580	2219860	are going, Oh, uh, kills the skills. I'm like, no, it's not. Kill is when you go and you give
2219860	2228340	everyone a fair chance to enjoy the game. Kill is when you're not just setting traps, you know,
2228340	2233140	unless you're playing trapper. Uh, you know, we were studying using a slugged person as bait or
2233780	2240900	just face camping somebody. And on top of that now I just flat out someone's face camping. I just,
2240900	2243940	I don't bother getting them. I just go in and do gens.
2243940	2247140	Exactly. That's what you have to do. Well, the reassurance perk, if,
2247140	2250740	if you're running it, which I usually don't, but it's extremely helpful now for those,
2250740	2259380	you know, face campers is great on two story levels. Yeah. Yeah. Cause then you can totally
2259380	2266660	just, uh, run above them. Yeah. Anyway. Um, there was dead by daylight, but here's,
2266660	2269860	here's the other game I've been playing this weekend. This one even surprised me,
2269860	2273540	but, um, and I'm sure it'll come up again later in the show. So sorry if I'm, uh,
2273540	2278740	biting a story here, but, um, you know, with Tokyo game show, Microsoft made several announcements
2278740	2282980	and they announced, you know, they were kind of focused on game pass a lot as they have been
2282980	2286980	lately in the States and other countries. So why wouldn't they do the same for Japan?
2286980	2291140	Uh, and they added a lot of stuff to game pass. And one of the games they added to game pass was
2291140	2296020	Assassin's Creed Odyssey. And I was like, Hmm, what the heck? I want to download this to see
2296020	2301700	what it's all about. And I have to admit, it took me a minute to get into it. I wasn't super
2301700	2308500	feeling it in the beginning, but as the game kind of started to ramp up a little bit and like the
2308500	2313620	world started opening up and I was getting branching questing paths, I'm kind of into it
2313620	2319300	now. Uh, and yeah, you know, I don't usually play these games. It's not, I don't know. I just,
2319860	2325940	I don't know why I just never have been, uh, super into the, the actiony, I think because I don't
2325940	2331860	really care for like stealth stuff. And I know Assassin's Creed is a lot of that, but because,
2331860	2336260	you know, how many of these games have there been by now? A ton, right? So they've learned
2336260	2340740	from each game. And a lot of them are in Stadia. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, and, but the thing with
2340740	2344260	Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and I'm sure some of the other more recent ones do this too,
2344980	2351380	but they, they have Bobby Black Wolf mode in it left and right. And it's, it's very easy. The
2351380	2358180	stealth part is not difficult. And even if you get seen, the enemies are like, what, what's that?
2358180	2364020	What's going on? They're kind of like slowly walking. Like it's just like very over the top
2364020	2369380	in like, they're not very skilled. Um, and you even can get an ability like right off the bat
2369380	2374980	where like, if you get seen, you can slow time instantly. So you can fire off an arrow shot
2374980	2379620	and still get like the first hit on him, even when you get seen. So they've, and I'm sure there
2379620	2385220	are a lot of people that will be like, well, that's not skill. That's I don't care. You sit
2385220	2390100	down and shut up and let me play my game the way I want to. And having those five seconds to get
2390100	2396180	that perfect headshot in with an arrow is just, is that's what I needed to make the game a little
2396180	2402340	more welcoming and interesting. And, um, yeah, I've been, I've been having fun with it and it
2402340	2407780	is really pretty. I will say this. It is really, really pretty because, um, I haven't been able to,
2407780	2412820	you know, I got this new PC a few months ago and I haven't played a lot of cutting edge 4k games on
2412820	2420900	it, but this game looks, looks marvelous, uh, on my system. It's, it's beautiful. Uh, I can't wait
2420900	2425220	to get to some more varied environments, but like I was in a cave and I was like, oh, this like
2425220	2429060	Tomb Raider I'm playing right now. This is cool. And then like, you know, some of the outside world
2429060	2434740	is very pretty that you, you take over a bird and some portions of the bird helps you see what's
2434740	2439140	going on, like literally a bird's eye view. So you can assess the situation before you go in
2439140	2444260	there. And like the way it handles it is very seamless and very, very cool. So yeah, I think,
2444260	2449220	I think I'm into Assassin's Creed all of a sudden, isn't that weird and wild, but this game is
2449220	2455140	interesting. Let me tell you the one complaint I have. So for, and this is, this is a silly
2455140	2460740	complaint, but I don't care. It's a complaint. So, you know, I'm spoiled by things like Mass Effect,
2461380	2466740	where you can create your own character. In this game, you can, you can at least pick your
2466740	2472900	character. Now you can play either Alexios, male, you can play Cassandra, a female. You couldn't
2472900	2480180	always even pick between those two. Um, but like Alexios, I just, I kind of wish I could make them
2480180	2486900	look different. Like I just don't really care for the base model. Um, but okay, whatever. And,
2486900	2493540	and why didn't I play Cassandra? I really could have, but I heard, I heard there was, uh,
2493540	2499220	same sex romance available in the game. So for that reason, I'm going to stick with Alexios.
2499780	2501140	So, um,
2501140	2509620	There was one I was interested in and it was, um, because in one of my art history classes, our
2509620	2515540	teacher talking about the Vatican, um, put up a picture of a screenshot from, I want to say it
2515540	2522180	was Assassin's Creed 2. Yeah, probably. That, uh, was actually a pretty faithful recreation
2522180	2528980	of what this particular block in Italy was supposed to look like. And ever since then,
2528980	2532340	I was like, I just want to play it and explore and not do any of the missions.
2532340	2537460	That, no, that is legit a mode in the newer games. Like maybe not Assassin's Creed 2,
2537460	2541620	but like, I haven't explored it yet. Maybe Quest Buster or somebody who knows the series better
2541620	2546420	than I do can elaborate, but I noticed there's an option on the main menu called discovery.
2546420	2551460	And I think with the last game, so the last game, uh, the name escapes you. It might've been
2551460	2556340	origins, but it was ancient Egypt themed. And I think they started there where you just like,
2556340	2560980	you can have like a history exploration mode where you just like are exploring the pyramids
2560980	2565300	in the game and this stuff. And I believe they did it here too, where you just are exploring
2565300	2570020	ancient Greece. Uh, and that whole thing, uh, that Quest Buster says in origins and Odyssey,
2570020	2574660	there is a tour mode. You can enable to just walk around and get the history behind the areas.
2574660	2582420	So, so there you go right up your alley. Right. So yeah. Yeah. So you don't, you don't,
2582420	2587460	if that's the game for you, that can literally be the game for you. I think that's pretty cool.
2588020	2592020	Uh, it's interesting because now there's ads for the new Assassin's Creed Mirage,
2592020	2595940	like all over the title screen and stuff. It's interesting how they can kind of do that,
2596580	2601220	um, in the, in the interface. But, uh, yeah, so I know I never thought I would become like
2601220	2605940	an Assassin's Creed fan, but I'm kind of like into this game. So we'll see, we'll see how we'll see,
2605940	2609940	you know, it's going to take me what, like 50 hours to beat it. So check in with me again in
2609940	2615300	a couple of weeks. Cause they also released Nino Cooney remastered edition on game pass.
2615300	2620420	And I've been very tempted to revisit that game, especially now that it's remastered, but, um,
2620420	2626740	you know, we'll see. We'll see. All right. That's plenty for my gaming week. Let's get into some
2626740	2636020	other gaming news. Um, it was a busy week. Like I said, yeah, short and sweet Minecraft, the biggest
2637700	2646820	realm ever. His biggest build ever build ever. Yes. So it's going to be amazing. You'll, I you'll
2646820	2650180	have to see what it looks like. Yeah. Did you see the Tokyo game show, uh,
2650180	2654420	sale on steam by the way? Ooh, no, I didn't. Is there some good stuff on there?
2654420	2659700	There's like a Ninja Gaiden master collection and a lot of the final fantasy updates. And,
2659700	2667620	but one that kind of surprised me was seeing a layer section. Um, which is probably one of the
2667620	2671060	favorite shooters we have in the house is actually galactic attack in a layer section.
2672020	2678420	Um, I mean, we've got them on Saturn, but, but I mean, and there's some pretty decent, uh,
2678420	2682500	mat games on there too, like some cute little stuff, but I was actually just really
2683300	2689220	surprised to see some of the ones on here. Um, also, uh, one of the, the 3d Toho games.
2690100	2692500	Well, you mentioned the final fan. If those are the pixel,
2692500	2698100	uh, Toho mechanical, uh, schoolery. If those are the, um, pixel remasters for
2698100	2701460	final fantasy, I do want to go back and pick more of them up. Cause I like, they,
2701460	2705780	they did a good job with four. I w that's the only one I bought. I only allowed myself to buy final
2705780	2712260	fantasy four and I liked it. Um, but I resisted buying any of the others because I was convinced
2712260	2717460	they were going to put them all out on switch at some point, but now June has come and gone.
2717460	2722260	Now Tokyo game shows come and gone with the Nintendo direct to play and no sign of the pixel
2722260	2726820	remasters. So I have a feeling maybe they're not going to put it on console after all. Of course,
2726820	2730100	they're just waiting for me to buy it and then it'll get put on console.
2731540	2737940	So, um, there's a game that I have on my list when it comes out called drill man rumble.
2739220	2743300	That's like a fighting game with people with giant drills.
2744180	2749460	Nice. Uh, and over in chat, of course the classic is on there by the way. Sorry.
2749460	2754100	No, that's right. The classic joke of Bobby black Wolf hates Nino Cooney has come up in our chat
2754100	2759220	room, uh, talking about the demo, because if y'all didn't remember and, you know, to explain
2759220	2764820	a years old and joke at this point, the original demo for Nino Cooney was terrible because it did
2764820	2769860	not give enough explanation as to what the hell was going on in the game. And so it was just,
2769860	2774820	it really was not fun to play through and it really did not get leave a good impression for
2774820	2779940	the game. But by the time the game came out, I ended up playing it anyway. And I actually liked
2779940	2785140	it. And I was like, wow, they did a really shit job with the demo because they did not, uh, make
2785140	2789620	this game as good as it actually is. I remember playing Nino Cooney 2 as well, which I believe
2790580	2796500	had some differences. It's been years since I've touched either one of them, but Nino Cooney 2
2796500	2801540	wasn't bad either. So I'm curious about the remaster for the first one, because despite,
2801540	2804740	you know, all this, you know, stuff that Bobby black Wolf says about the demo,
2805700	2812980	it is time to let a PlayStation 3 demo go now that we're on a remasters on, uh, you know,
2812980	2819220	PlayStation 4 slash 5. And so, uh, I'm curious, especially now it's on game pass, like, you know,
2819220	2822900	hello, you don't have to pay anything extra for it if you're already paying for game pass.
2822900	2828180	So it makes a pretty good case to check it out. And of course, never, never forget, never forgive
2828180	2835380	you typical gamers. You all in chat. All right, let's move on and talk about speaking of
2835380	2840740	PlayStation. Thanks to Tokyo game show this week, we got a lot of PlayStation news in a,
2840740	2845940	in a state of play. I keep saying PlayStation direct. We all know what influenced PlayStation
2845940	2849860	state of play. We all know where it's a PlayStation direct, which is just their own branding. We get
2849860	2856420	it. It's just, it's Sony being on brand with stealing Nintendo ideas. Yeah. Um, so yes,
2856500	2860580	they had a state of play event where they showed off a bunch of different games,
2860580	2866500	including trailers for Tekken eight, which looks pretty awesome. Uh, they just have like a little
2866500	2871700	animated, I don't even know if it was really gameplay, but basically saying that stay tuned
2871700	2877860	for more information about that, uh, star Wars tales from the galaxies edge enhanced edition,
2877860	2881780	which is an enhanced version of the game that came out in the Oculus quest.
2882580	2887140	And that's supposed to be out for the PlayStation VR to whenever that's out, uh,
2887140	2892580	Demeo is coming to the PlayStation VR too, as well. It's like a tabletop, uh, VR game
2892580	2900820	and it looks pretty cool. Uh, like a dragon Asian, which is another, uh, Yakuza spinoff game.
2900820	2904100	Although, you know, not to be confused, I think like a dragon, I'm not sure if they're
2904740	2909780	re rebranding their whole Yakuza series. I will talk about this in a little bit. Exactly.
2909860	2914580	But anyways, uh, it's, it's, if you're thinking like a dragon being like the other,
2914580	2920260	like a dragon game, uh, it's not, it's more of like an action brawler type thing. I thought
2920260	2925380	they were, I thought they were making the, uh, dragon quest RPG, the new standard. I thought
2925380	2932020	that was the thing moving forward. Uh, no, this one does not look like that at all. So if it is,
2932020	2938180	it's doesn't reflect it. The gameplay trailer does not reflect that. Interesting. Um,
2939140	2943700	Hogwarts legacy got a new trailer, um, supposed to be coming out February 10th,
2944580	2949540	uh, Pacific drive looks interesting. I'm sorry. I have to get this off my chest. I am so mad
2950180	2956340	that that dumb woman who wrote a book once ruined the, this series for me because I, you know,
2956340	2963060	I look at that and I go, huh, it looks neat, but like, I, I can't bring myself to care at all about
2963460	2968900	that universe whatsoever. And it just, it just stinks. It's just, and I under look,
2968900	2972740	there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. I get that people have to pick and choose their
2972740	2976420	own battles. There's going to be people that buy that game, whatever you do, you bestie.
2976420	2981540	But I just, I can't bring myself to give a hoot about that game. And I'm just so angry at that
2981540	2986980	dumb woman for what she did to her own franchise. Anyway, I just, I'm sorry. I have to get that off
2986980	2994340	my chest. Yeah. Um, Pacific drive looks interesting. It's kind of like a first person
2994340	3001780	dystopian, like I guess a road trip type game. Um, it almost looks like the long drive, except if
3001780	3008260	it were a competent game and also had like weird stuff in there. Thank you. Chat room is clarified.
3008260	3012100	I didn't catch this, that you actually were talking about the two different games there.
3012100	3018260	Asian was a game that already existed. And so it was kind of like a, a precursor, if you will,
3018260	3023620	to you cause like a dragon that is not turn-based that because it wasn't in the series wasn't that
3023620	3029620	way, but now the mainline numbered games will be turn-based. So that's, that's what's going on
3029620	3036020	there. Cool. Thank you, Chad. Um, they talked a little bit about PlayStation stars, which is
3036020	3042740	their rewards program. That sounds like NFTs without saying that it's NFTs, but it's basically
3042740	3050180	you earn digital collectibles, which sounds so much like NFTs. And when they showed it,
3050180	3056420	it looks like NFTs, except I'm not sure if you can sell them. It's like, it's like, if you will,
3056420	3063060	um, the PlayStation trophies you would get in PlayStation home and being able to share like
3063060	3067300	little things that like, almost like achievements for that, but I'm not sure where you get these
3067300	3073300	from. And if you can trade them or whatever and sell them, then that sounds like NFTs, but it's
3073300	3077940	just stinks like NFTs right now. That was the exact same thing I was worried about when I first
3077940	3085060	heard about that. I was like, is this NFTs? Cause yikes. Uh, there's some. It smell like an NFT
3085700	3092820	and it looked like an NFT. Some third person, um, like power armor combat game, um,
3093940	3101380	called sin duality looked okay. Um, stellar blade kind of resembles a little bit of like a,
3101940	3111380	you know, anime, um, protagonist, dark souls type game. Looks neat, I guess, uh, rise of Ronan,
3111380	3117700	which is a new team Ninja game and, um, almost reminds me a little bit of an assassin screen
3117700	3125060	type thing, which, you know, neat, uh, got a war. Ragnarok has a controller that's coming out and
3125060	3130980	they also showed off a new story trailer as well for the game. And those are out in November.
3130980	3135700	And that was clearly the big thing that they were waiting to show off was, you know,
3135700	3139060	God of war. Cause that's going to be their big holiday title, obviously. So yeah.
3139700	3146020	Yeah. Is that game also on PS4? It is, isn't it? Yeah. Cause I guess technically they still don't
3146020	3151540	have PlayStation fives on target shelves. Although most people are saying they're relatively easier
3151540	3156900	to come by now than they were. So I still haven't seen them in stores. I have seen,
3156900	3160820	I think you still have to play the game a little bit, but you don't have to play it as hard as you
3160820	3168420	used to. Yeah. Like the Sony direct thing is a pretty reliable way to get them. I think is,
3168420	3171700	is what I'm hearing now. Yeah. I've been holding out. Cause I was going to see if
3171700	3174740	they were going to refresh them this year. That's what I thought might happen is there
3174740	3180100	might be a refresh. Um, but now I'm just honestly, at this point, I'm holding off to it. Cause
3180100	3186260	this is what inevitably always happens, you know, and Sony really has nobody, but well,
3186260	3189700	I would say themselves, but the industry does this. It doesn't matter. You could be Microsoft
3189700	3194980	and this is a halo console console. You could be Nintendo and this is a splatoon three.
3195060	3200980	It's not even a halo console anymore. Uh, yeah, yeah, we, uh, not after last what's happened,
3200980	3204340	but you know what I mean? Or it could be a splatoon three console comes out and then
3204340	3210020	literally like the next week, a, uh, scarlet violet Pokemon one comes out like in Nintendo.
3210020	3215300	But my point is now I'm waiting to see if a final fantasy 16 PlayStation five or something branded
3215300	3220980	with that comes out. We did see there was the Ragnarok controller coming. That looked very
3220980	3226500	pretty, um, for that. So it just, it just seems like, and maybe it, because maybe it wouldn't
3226500	3230500	be in good taste to do a limited edition console while they're still hard to come by. I don't know.
3230500	3236260	Um, but they're not doing a full Ragnarok console at least as far as we know. So, but if they do a
3236260	3241140	sick, that's what I'm holding out for now. That's why I'm not getting a PlayStation five yet is that
3241140	3246260	number one, I have a computer now good enough to play pretty much anything. And Sony is putting
3246260	3252260	out most stuff on PC. Now, if final fantasy 16 is not same date on PC, which I'm not expecting
3252260	3256980	it to be, then I will get a PlayStation five just for that game because I am a fan boy.
3258260	3265860	Yeah. Um, another bit of information that wasn't necessarily included in the state of play, it's
3265860	3271300	come out that the PlayStation two VR will not be backwards compatible with the PlayStation one VR,
3271300	3275940	which makes sense when you think about it. Cause I mean, this is the system for tracking
3276180	3281620	controllers are completely different. Like it would be hard to retrofit all of that stuff
3281620	3287860	back in there to get that stuff all compatible. Um, yeah. When I first heard the news, I was like,
3287860	3294580	what the fuck? What a, what a, what a terrible thing to do, you know, that to close off the
3294580	3300900	PlayStation VR one library. But then when I really sat down to think about it and read some followup
3300900	3305620	conversation, I was like, Oh yeah, they completely changed the tracking where there's actually no
3305620	3311620	camera that looks at you anymore. There's no more red and blue balls on the place that would
3311620	3315860	completely change the way that beat saber detection is working and things like that.
3315860	3322500	I'm sure many of the all star titles will be redone for play. I there, well, I keep saying
3322500	3326580	there will absolutely be a beat saber, but now that I think about it, that's all owned,
3327380	3332580	but I, they would be silly not to do it, but I guess anything's possible.
3332580	3334020	They are a silly company.
3334020	3337940	It's true. That is true. But Tetris effect, I imagine certainly will have a PSVR too.
3337940	3343780	I would see like, you know, and it's, it's good that we maybe get a, you know, a remaster of
3343780	3348180	until dawn rush of blood, you know, would be nice with some extra levels, please.
3348180	3356420	Yeah. So I understand why it's not backwards compatible. It stinks. You kind of wish there
3356420	3360980	was a way for them to just say, well, can't you just kind of have an easy translate emulate that?
3360980	3366580	No, it's not. It's not that easy, but hopefully it won't be too difficult for the all star games
3366580	3373220	to be repackaged. It does suck. But I mean, you can still play your PlayStation VR on the
3373220	3379460	PlayStation five, I think. So you just have to have the whole headsets. Yeah. And the camera
3379460	3388260	and the move controller. Yeah. There is all that. So what did you think overall of the PlayStation
3388260	3391780	state of play? Loki, were you, were you pleased with it? Were you kind of like,
3391780	3393700	I wish there'd been more or where were you at with that?
3393700	3398420	There's a lot of games I'm not really interested in, honestly. I mean, some of it looks good.
3398420	3402020	I've got a war. I haven't really played the last God of war game.
3402020	3408740	So I'm not super excited about it, but I know it's a good game. Yeah. I don't know.
3408740	3411700	Not really super excited about anything that they showed.
3411700	3417380	Um, I think the things that jumped out to me, um, even though I'm not a huge God of war person,
3417380	3421780	although, you know, it's new year, new me, anything can happen now, clearly based on my
3421780	3426500	gaming week. So never say never. Um, I think the games that really stood out to me, Pacific drive
3426500	3431300	looked kind of, it was very stylish and, you know, I like a good driving game,
3431300	3435540	although I understand there's more to it than that, but that, uh, the one that kind of surprised me,
3436180	3443300	was Demi-O, the one that was the tabletop RPG kind of in that VR space because I'm
3443940	3449540	admittedly not the Dungeons and Dragons and tabletop fan that a lot of other people are.
3449540	3455060	I'm certainly not a hater. I think it's a great creative outlet and like, maybe I just kind of
3455060	3459380	wish I had a group and I'd play it more regularly. I don't know. You know, that's on PC though.
3459940	3462500	Oh, the Demi-O? Yeah, it's already out on PC.
3463460	3468100	See, that's good to know. That's good to know. Uh, and then Tekken 8 looked, you know,
3468100	3471940	looks pretty, you know, even though we kind of, we kind of knew it was coming. Uh, it's,
3471940	3476740	it's still nice to have it confirmed and it looked very pretty. Um, you know, rain, rain and more
3476740	3484420	rain. Yes. All right. Um, going to chat a lot of comments on the, uh, PSVR stuff. Bobby, uh,
3484420	3489220	Black Wolf, who's on before us here at VOG Network says it's easier to write the new tracking into
3489220	3493460	your game than it is to build an entire emulation layer to translate what your game is looking for
3493460	3499220	into what the PSVR 2 is actually able to detect. Is it possible? Yes. Well, thank you for at least
3499220	3503940	putting that out there. Would it cost a lot of time and money? Yes. Would it be janky and not
3503940	3510180	a great emulation? Also, yes. And I do understand all that. It's just, I can't, yeah, I can't not
3510180	3515460	sit here and go, ah, it's a bummer, but I get it. I wonder though, if there is a possibility
3515460	3520340	for them, like say that a developer really wanted to like get their game to work with it, if they
3520340	3527060	could like add a compatibility with that stuff, like if they could just rewrite how it works or
3527060	3532420	something like that. I would imagine, I would imagine they've already reached out to the top 10
3532420	3539460	VR game makers and having those conversations. In fact, if you think about it, um, one of the games
3539460	3547140	that I know is very popular on PSVR is No Man's Sky and Hello Games some time ago announced that
3547140	3553540	there was going to be a PSVR 2 version before it was confirmed that it's not going to be compatible
3553540	3558420	with PS because there were some people going, well, yeah, of course there's going to be a VR 2
3558420	3563780	version. They're just going to take the VR 1 version and push the button differently. But now
3563780	3567380	now that we've all sat down and critically thought about it, oh wait, no, Hello Games is actually
3567380	3573460	going and making a PSVR 2 version of No Man's Sky. So, you know, there, I would say look at
3573460	3577860	the top 10 PlayStation VR games and Sony's probably having conversations and I would bet
3578980	3584500	dimes to dollars No Man's Sky is one of the top 10 games. So we already knew that's coming. So,
3585540	3590500	all right. Uh, let's see Zen Monkey 11 in chat says I'm a PlayStation VR owner and I'm happy
3590500	3594740	it's not backwards compatible. They needed to upgrade that thing. They better have better
3594740	3599620	lenses this time around. No one talks about how bad the lenses were on the PSVR, my main issue
3599620	3605540	with it. Yeah. So, I mean, you know, the, maybe it's just going to feel smoother, feel better,
3605540	3610740	you know, um, just as a device. And so maybe we need to leave the past in the past. I don't know.
3610740	3617300	So, all right. Uh, that was the PlayStation State of Play. Let's talk about now the Nintendo Direct
3617300	3623460	that also happened this week. By the way, neither of these things we knew were happening, although,
3623460	3627700	you know, with Tokyo Game Show this week, you should have probably anticipated it.
3627700	3632180	But we did get a Nintendo Direct that happened this week, and there was quite a few announcements
3632180	3638100	that were made in that as well. Fire Emblem Engage was announced. Fire Emblem is back,
3638100	3643860	and this is a new game in the series that will be out in January of 2023. It Takes Two,
3643860	3648820	which I believe was Game of the Year at the Game Awards last year, is now getting a Nintendo Switch
3648820	3653060	version. So that is coming out on November 4th. But of course, if you want to put down your money
3653060	3658340	for a pre-order, you can already do that now. Fatal Frame, Mask of the Lunar Eclipse.
3658900	3663380	This game was originally on the Wii. It was not released outside of Japan, but guess what? You
3663380	3668660	are getting an English version now in early 2023 on the Switch. And I know, Fatal Frame is
3668660	3674500	definitely one of those like cult hit series of games. So there's going to be some very specific
3674500	3679220	people out here that will be very happy with this news. So, um, congrats to the Fatal Frame fans.
3679780	3684420	Uh, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was just confirmed there's new content coming. That really shouldn't
3684420	3689220	be too much of a surprise, but Eno is coming in the second wave of the expansion pass,
3689220	3693540	and she has new abilities for the roster. There'll be new challenge battles and so on and so on.
3693540	3699220	October 13th is the day for all of that. Guess what? If you love SpongeBob SquarePants and who
3699220	3703060	doesn't love a good SpongeBob SquarePants reaction image, you have a whole new game,
3703060	3707860	the Cosmic Shake. It's a platformer with seven areas, and it's coming next year.
3707860	3711780	All the original voice actors, uh, will be participating in the game.
3713140	3718820	Uh, if you love Fist of the North Star, you can now play fitness boxing, or at least you will in
3718820	3726980	March, which is based on Fist of the North Star. It's basically a rhythm game. Wasn't this a game
3726980	3731140	already? Like, it was back when we did Bamani games.
3731140	3732900	I'm thinking of the Punch Mania version.
3732900	3736260	Is it, but was it Fist of the North Star related? The Punch-
3736260	3737140	No, but-
3737140	3739300	No, there was one that was Fist of the North Star.
3739300	3745460	Yes, because didn't we play it at Arcade Infinity once? Because when I saw this, I was like,
3745460	3749700	wasn't this at Arcade Infinity, like, years ago? Like, I swear this was a thing.
3751060	3756500	Okay, thank you in chat. Uh, Dartesia says, uh, Hokuto no Ken Punch Mania.
3756500	3757700	Hokuto no Ken.
3757700	3758900	Yeah, so-
3758900	3760580	Which is Fist of the North Star.
3760580	3765460	That's it. So I, okay, so this is kind of something we've seen before, but it's kind of
3765460	3770420	neat. Who thought you'd ever see this come back, right? So we're getting a lot of, like,
3770420	3771860	interesting Japanese revival.
3771860	3773060	It is a deep cut.
3773060	3780900	It is a deep cut. This is a B side, but it's cool that it's getting the A treatment.
3782260	3786980	Then we had some farming simulators, starting with Oddballers. Oh no, I'm sorry, Oddballers.
3786980	3787780	No, that's a-
3787780	3792660	My bad. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Oddballers is multiplayer dodgeball. My list is off here.
3793060	3795380	Uh, that is coming out early next year.
3795940	3799940	Tunic is coming out on September 22nd. We already knew that game was coming,
3799940	3801620	we got a date for it though.
3801620	3807060	Front Mission 1 and 2. If you're a fan of these, uh, tactical games, uh, that is gonna be coming
3807060	3811220	out in 2023, and there'll be a third game in the series coming out eventually as well.
3811220	3814180	Now, Story of Seasons, A Wonderful Life, there you go.
3814180	3818340	Uh, there's your farming sim, uh, because don't you love farming sims?
3818340	3821460	Don't you want to play Feh Farm? Don't you want to play that as well?
3822660	3828180	Uh, Octopath Traveler 2. It's coming. It's a thing. It's happening. Eight new,
3828180	3833060	uh, travelers in this game. Uh, it's going to be, uh, taking place in a similar kind of
3833060	3838740	industrial time as the first game. Uh, so yeah, this will be, uh, interesting. It's gonna have
3838740	3843620	a time mechanic, which will mean you have different abilities between daytime and nighttime.
3843620	3849460	Uh, and this time, instead of the completely separate stories, traveler stories will intersect
3849460	3853380	earlier on in the game. February 24th, 2023 is when that's coming out.
3854020	3860580	Honestly, the biggest news for me, uh, and, uh, for anyone with taste, quite frankly,
3861620	3867700	Theatrhythm, final bar line is coming out. Yay. They are finally doing Theatrhythm on the Switch.
3867700	3872260	They're also doing it on PlayStation 4 and 5. It just wasn't a part of the direct,
3872260	3878740	but this makes me very happy. 385 songs from the Final Fantasy series,
3878740	3885460	and if that's not enough, how about 90 download songs? And if that's not enough, how about 27
3885460	3890820	additional songs in the digital deluxe edition? Pretty much, if it is a Square Enix song,
3890820	3895380	outside of Kingdom Hearts, because you have to play Melody of Mediocrity if you want to play the,
3895380	3898980	um, Kingdom Hearts songs. I think that's what it was called. At least in my head,
3898980	3903300	that's what it was called. Um, if you want to play the Kingdom Hearts songs, you got to go over
3903300	3911540	there. But, like, there's Nier songs in this, Chrono Trigger. I mean, am I going to drop $100
3911540	3918420	on the digital collector's edition of this? Honestly, probably. Sorry, not sorry, but,
3919140	3925700	again, we had this discussion earlier in the show. Am I a fanboy for Final Fantasy games? Yes.
3925700	3930260	Am I going to drop $100 for, like, 500 different songs across Squares?
3930260	3934020	You can't say that you're not getting your money's worth with 500 songs. Like,
3934020	3937860	if I said, oh, hey, I'm going to buy a DDR game with 500 songs in it, you'd be like,
3937860	3944100	damn, that's a good value. Exactly. Exactly. So, I'm excited. I'll be buying it, and I look forward
3944100	3949220	to playing with Bobby Blackwolf online, and many of you as well. Uh, Mario and Rabbids,
3949220	3952980	Sparks of Hope. We knew that there was a new Mario and Rabbids game. Now we know it's coming
3952980	3958500	on October 20th. Uh, Rune Factory 3 Special. If you were a fan of Rune Factory 3 on the DS,
3959140	3963300	you can have a special time on the Nintendo Switch in 2023.
3963300	3969060	Some new games announced for the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo Switch online. We will be seeing later
3969060	3978580	this year, Pilotwings 64 and Mario Party 1 and 2. And then in 2023, Mario Party 3, Pokemon Stadium
3978580	3987300	1 and 2, 1080 Snowboarding, and Excitebike 64. Oh, and one game that we never thought we would see
3987300	3993300	added to the service, because licensing is a bitch, but they got it worked out,
3993300	4000340	Goldeneye 007. That's right. The Nintendo 64 Classic Goldeneye is also coming out.
4000340	4005460	Now, what was interesting about this, even though they weren't having it direct at the same time,
4006100	4012020	Microsoft, you know, because of the rare connection, at the exact same time announced,
4012100	4019140	they are also getting a remastered version of the original Goldeneye on their platform. However,
4019140	4025540	it will not have online play. This version will because it's already baked into the emulator that
4025540	4030740	Nintendo put out online, but the one on Xbox, they're trying to focus the conversation on couch
4030740	4036820	co-op and all this stuff. Regardless, any way you slice it, this game was better in your memory than
4036820	4042820	it is now. I guarantee it. That game made me so sick I passed out. I'm serious.
4044100	4048500	And here's the other thing about it that maybe plays into this a little bit. Bobby brought up
4048500	4055780	a great point on his show. The standard for controlling first-person games now that Halo and
4055780	4061700	those games have established, this game did not control the same way. So to try to go back and
4061700	4066820	play a game like this after you've played the Halos, the Dooms, the other first-person games
4066820	4072500	of the world, it's not easy to go back and play Goldeneye. So again, I just want to remind you all
4072500	4078180	this game is better in your memory than it is now, but you know what? I bet you're excited anyway.
4078180	4082740	Go off, have fun, enjoy this game for the 15 minutes you'll play it before you move on to
4082740	4087140	something else once it comes out of the Nintendo 64 emulator. But if you're able to recreate that
4087140	4095300	magic of 1998 in your living room, you know what? Go off, have fun. So by the way, they already
4095300	4101380	redid Goldeneye on the Nintendo Wii in 2010. Do you remember that? But I think they had to take
4101380	4106100	out Pierce Brosnan's face and they may have replaced it with Daniel Craig. That was a whole
4106100	4112900	thing that they did. But does anyone remember they've already did and it didn't sell quite
4113540	4115300	because again, Goldeneye is better.
4115300	4120420	Well, that was Goldeneye Reloaded and it was awful because Activision did it and Activision
4120420	4123140	like half-assed it. So, you know.
4124500	4128100	We all know that the Goldeneye game was Brosnan's best role as Bond.
4130500	4136420	More games for the Nintendo Direct. Various Daylife, a new RPG for the Switch on from
4136420	4141540	Square Enix, and it's out now. I believe this was already out on mobile devices,
4141540	4143060	so it's not exactly new.
4143060	4146820	It's funny. Various Daylife sounds like it would be like a subreddit or something with
4146820	4149220	random pictures of people or something.
4149220	4150820	It was an Apple Arcade.
4150820	4156740	That's okay. That's why I thought it was a mobile title first. Actually, funny enough, you do chores.
4156740	4158740	I didn't get into it. I didn't really like it.
4158740	4164580	Yeah. You do chores in exchange for job classes. It almost sounds like, what was that level five
4164580	4170180	game? Actually, that game was super underrated though. It was like something life. Somebody
4170180	4173860	will know what I'm talking about in chat. It was a really underground favorite.
4175620	4182100	I think it was the 3DS or the regular DS, and it was a level five game and it never got a sequel.
4182100	4184420	Fantasy Life. Thank you. That's what it was.
4185700	4186980	That was the game I was trying to think of.
4188180	4191300	Factorio is coming out for Switch on October 28th.
4192100	4198260	IB is a 2D pixel art horror game coming out in the spring of 2023.
4198900	4204420	Mario Strikers Battle League. It's a new update for the already released Mario Strikers,
4204420	4208980	and Pauline and Diddy Kong are joining the roster. You can check that out later this month.
4209780	4214020	Atelier Ryza 3 is coming out as well, because it is Tokyo Game Show,
4214020	4218340	so why not have some Japanese RPGs? That'll be out on February 24th, 2023.
4219140	4225380	A reminder that there are Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course passes coming.
4225460	4229700	Merry Mountain and Peach Gardens from DS will be available this holiday,
4229700	4234580	so that is on its way out. Nintendo Switch Sports is getting golf,
4234580	4236500	because we knew they were going to be adding games to that.
4237380	4244020	Nintendo did a whole spotlight on Pikmin Bloom, which that game's been out, so well,
4244020	4247460	I know why they did a spotlight, because they need more people to be playing it.
4248020	4253220	And to be fair, they've made a lot of changes to that game from the first year,
4253220	4258660	and while I didn't love all the changes, I would say, especially the fact that you can now finally,
4258660	4264500	this change just went in a week ago, you can buy expansions and things like that with coins,
4264500	4269460	instead of having to pay the $2.99 to expand that type of stuff. You can now use the free to play
4269460	4274340	coins, although they're slow to get, but you can get them, to pay for that stuff. So that's a huge
4274340	4278900	quality of life change that they made that's a good thing right there. But anyway, they just,
4278900	4282420	they need more people playing the game. That's why they did a spotlight on it.
4282660	4288180	I'm surprised that they didn't walk back any pre-COVID changes or COVID changes that they had.
4288980	4291220	They didn't really make COVID changes to Pikmin Bloom.
4291220	4295300	Oh, they didn't. Well, how nice for Niantic to not do it for that game.
4295300	4300900	Yeah, right. All right. But that all led into a Pikmin 4 announcement. And that's
4300900	4304180	really all we know. We didn't get a screenshot or nothing. Pikmin 4 is coming.
4304180	4309140	No, I thought we got, oh no, that's right. It wasn't Pikmin. I thought we had like screenshots.
4309140	4312900	Oh, I thought it was like a concept thing. I didn't think it was like an actual screenshot.
4312900	4315300	I mean, okay. So maybe we did get a screenshot.
4316820	4320740	No, they have like some like test footage or whatever they're talking about. Like you're
4320740	4323700	going to be able to play the game from like the Pikmin perspective or something like that.
4324420	4332260	But at the same time, why are we getting another Pikmin game? F-Zero. F-Zero. We've already had,
4332260	4336660	like, we've already had two Pikmin games now in the time that we haven't had F-Zero.
4336660	4343140	And that is a crime. That is a hate crime. I will be writing my congresspeople tomorrow.
4344100	4348340	Just Dance 2023. Hello. You knew this game was coming because it's coming everywhere else.
4348340	4355300	November 22nd is the day. Harvest Ella because you love your farming games. There's a new demo
4355300	4358740	on the eShop that just came out if you want to check it out. And you can get the full game on
4358740	4364020	November 4th. You knew we were going to see Bayonetta 3. So it was nice to get a new peak
4364020	4371060	at that. And October 28th, again, is the day for that. Raincode Master Detective Archives. That is
4371860	4375860	Danganronpa. The people that made that game are making this game.
4375860	4376980	Like Jynsoft.
4376980	4381300	Yeah. So they are making this. So I'm sure some people will be checking it out based on that
4381300	4387620	alone. If you want to play Resident Evil, either Village or Biohazard, the seventh game, or the
4387620	4392420	two or three remakes, if you want to play those on the Switch, guess what? You can. But guess what?
4392420	4397220	They're cloud versions. So you have to have a constant internet connection for it to work.
4397940	4404900	But hey, you know what? Some people, they want to have it on their portable device,
4404900	4408660	even though they can't leave their house. But OK. It's going to be coming.
4410260	4416980	Sifu, a kung fu game coming out November 8th. Crisis Core, Final Fantasy VII Reunion.
4416980	4423220	I'm surprised this was in the Nintendo Direct and not in the PlayStation thing, but OK. December
4423220	4430900	13th is the day this is coming out. Radiant Silver Gun. That was kind of random and cool to hear.
4430900	4435620	That is out on the Switch right now. It was a It's Out Today port announcement.
4435620	4436340	I'm going to go get it now.
4437140	4438980	I thought you might have already picked it up.
4439780	4442900	Well, I haven't switched my Switch in a while.
4443780	4448980	Sorry, I know there's a lot of games. I'm almost done. Endless Dungeon. It takes place in an
4448980	4453140	abandoned space station. It's a procedurally generated roguelike for four players that's
4453140	4457860	coming out next year. Tales of Symphonia is getting a remaster. So if you're a Tales of
4457860	4463060	Fan, you can check that out. Life is Strange. The Arcadia Bay collection is coming to the Switch.
4463060	4469220	So this is, you know, some of the earlier Life is Strange games all repackaged. Lego Brick Tales.
4469220	4472500	You know, it's coming out everywhere. And of course, it's coming out on the Switch as well.
4473540	4479300	Romancing Saga. The minstrel song remastered. That is coming out on December 1st.
4479300	4485380	Disney Speedstorm. This game looks particularly interesting after the, you know, somewhat success
4485380	4490180	of the Disney Dreamlight Valley. This game is coming out on the Switch as well later this year.
4491140	4495220	The second season of Fall Guys already started. It started on September 15th.
4495860	4500980	The Return to Dreamland Deluxe. Kirby's Return to Dreamland Deluxe. It's a remake of the
4500980	4509780	2011 Wii game. And this will be out on February 24th, 2023. All right. And then the big finale,
4509780	4516820	the big climax. Breath of the Wild 2 has a real name now. It is The Legend of Zelda,
4516820	4523220	Tears of the Kingdom, which some people have pointed out may have been the reason that the
4523220	4528580	Direct was delayed in Europe because of the passing of the Queen, the Tears of the Kingdom.
4529220	4535220	I don't know if there is any fact in that, but it is awfully interesting. But anyhow,
4536100	4540500	the game is officially called The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. That is the
4540500	4544740	sequel to Breath of the Wild. There was just a little peek because originally when it first
4544740	4549060	started playing, I was like, are they doing like a Skyward Sword thing? I was like, oh no,
4549060	4552260	it's Breath of the Wild. It's just got the Skyward, you know, all that in it. But we know
4552340	4558100	that's going to be in there with a glider and all that stuff. Also, we got a date May 12th,
4558100	4565540	2023. So the long, long, long wait for Breath of the Wild 2 or now as we know it Tears of the
4565540	4574020	Kingdom is almost over. So some thoughts in chat. Dark Tetsuya says, Yeah, that's what I was
4574020	4579060	thinking. Maybe a bit too close to home. Oh, interesting. Dark Tetsuya says radiant silver
4579300	4583940	apparently got pulled. The rating got changed. I don't know if it's back up yet.
4583940	4588900	That's interesting. So I didn't find it. That might be why it's not there yet. So you might
4588900	4592980	have to check again in a couple of days. That's interesting. I wonder what happened there. That's
4592980	4601220	a yikes. So yeah. Well, I'm sure it's coming back. But yeah, that is really random. So
4601860	4605220	and what would have changed about the rating? It's not like the game
4605220	4612420	had an excessive amount. I guess. All right. Anyway, let's move on. More and more stuff out
4612420	4618580	of Tokyo Game Show, I guess. And even though things leak, sometimes it doesn't stop the
4618580	4622740	news from coming and having the officialness behind it. But Dark Soccer, what do you got?
4624580	4631620	So I have, well, number one, I have been a big Street Fighter fan for a very long time,
4631620	4640020	and they have leaked the full roster, the launch day roster for Street Fighter 6. And that's more
4640020	4648020	than what they just have on their character page on the website. So the leaked list starts with
4648020	4662260	Aki or AKI, Akuma or Goki, Blanca, Kami, DJ, Dhalsim, Honda, Ed, JP, Judy, Ken, Kimberly.
4662260	4668740	Kimberly is cool. Okay, she's supposed to like, be like, I guess, guys version of Sakura.
4669620	4670100	Oh, neat.
4671220	4679700	Bushin Ryu fangirl. There's Lily, Marisa, Mimi, Rashid, and Zangief. And they've already
4681220	4686900	shown gameplay of Kami wearing her classic costumes. So the theory is that the classic
4686900	4691700	costumes are going to be in there. I'm going to our chat for some reactions,
4691700	4694980	because people have opinions on Street Fighter 6. I do too. I think it looks great.
4695780	4701860	Um, apart from how it looks, though, the control on it is it's kind of a weird fight system.
4702500	4705860	Interesting. I think a lot of the classic players aren't really going to care for it.
4707860	4712900	But I don't know. I don't know. It's just it's very simplified.
4713620	4717460	It's piquing my interest in a way five never did. So I'm curious.
4717460	4723140	I still think that Street Fighter 4 was up there with probably the pinnacle next to Alpha 2.
4723140	4730260	Oh, I love 4. 4 is yeah, I love 4. Going to chat twitch.tv slash vog network. Mike Deff says
4730260	4734740	Street Fighter 6 looks so good like leagues better than Street Fighter 5 did at launch. Yeah,
4734740	4737540	hard agree on that to be honest. Like all the color splashes,
4737540	4745380	though. I think that that that just is too overwhelming. But but yeah, and and dark test,
4745380	4749780	like dark Tetsuya said there is a closed beta. I've been lined up for it for a little bit.
4750580	4759460	Um, but it's gonna it lists the systems that will be available. So that's PS5, Xbox and Steam.
4761860	4766260	Sorry, Nintendo Switch fans, but it just can't unless they do a cloud version,
4766260	4774340	it probably just can't run six as well as the others can. All right. Well, let's move on.
4774340	4781060	Loki. Yeah, so apparently, the Sims 4 is going to be going free to play.
4782420	4786660	Which makes sense because they have so many expansions for it, they'd probably want to have
4786660	4790820	the base game available for free. So people can get hooked and buy all the expansions.
4791540	4798020	So that is going to be the case. It says Sims 4 will be free to download
4798020	4801460	across PC, Mac and consoles, October 18.
4803220	4808980	I love what Jason said in tonight's intro about this. He said it so well. He said,
4808980	4814500	EA has finally discovered the shareware system of the 1990s. And that it worked
4815940	4820740	that they give you the base for free. And then, like, you know, $1,000. There's a ton of DLC,
4820740	4825940	this game. There is so much and my son was addicted to he's not addicted to but he likes
4825940	4829620	playing the game. So he does spend like his steam money usually is going to
4830580	4836900	buying expansions for this game. Like he has a ton of the Sims 4 expansions. So it's
4836900	4841620	it's funny. And I've said this on the show before is I really think Dead by Daylight ought to do
4841620	4846820	the same thing. But if you think about it, like, they kind of keep giving away based dead by
4846820	4854500	daylight a lot, like whether it's you know, an epic game store giveaway or in Microsoft game pass,
4854500	4859540	you know, depending on if you consider that free or not. I think it was a Sony games. I almost
4859540	4863540	said games with gold. That's not what they call it. PlayStation Plus, I think I think I have an
4863540	4868020	epic. Yeah, it was when it launched an epic store. They gave it away for free that week. So like,
4868020	4870740	Dead by Daylight is one of those games where I also think they ought to just give away the
4870740	4874420	base game for free because you know, they're making their money off battle passes and DLC.
4874420	4881380	But they kind of think it's it's pretty easy to get for free if you just pay attention,
4881380	4884580	you know, and follow, you know, those discount Twitters and stuff.
4885460	4891220	By the way, about Sims 4, I still have a lot of my mods from the Sims resource.
4892500	4893460	If your son wants them.
4894180	4897380	Well, I was actually kind of curious on your take Dark Sakura because you know,
4897380	4901380	some of the longtime listeners of the program remember you being quite the Sims fan,
4901380	4905220	as Joan Hunter-Matton chat says, I remember the early years of the show about Jamie modding the
4905220	4909860	hell out of Sims. So I'm kind of curious, is this something I mean, is have you just kind of
4909860	4911620	kind of gone past this franchise or?
4912500	4915780	I got bored and I got tired of paying for different things.
4918100	4923540	I'll be honest, I mean, I never really actually played the game, I would just build houses
4923540	4927780	and make them as funky as I could. And then I would be bored.
4927780	4928280	Yeah.
4928820	4935540	I it was all just like the building element for me, you know, designing doing my character creation
4935620	4943380	and my old PC would be like, how many more mods are you going to stuff in this game before I die?
4944420	4945060	And there's there's.
4945060	4946340	Oh, watch.
4946340	4951700	There's nothing wrong with deciding that, oh, OK, I'm kind of done with this game series for now.
4951700	4957380	I'm into this thing now. You know, friendship ended with Sims. Now Dead by Daylight is my
4957380	4960180	new best friend. It's just it's OK.
4960660	4965620	I would go back to like I went to Sims for a bit after it came out
4967060	4975700	and like I would make different Sims for people, you know, and I don't know, I just I got meh.
4976660	4977160	Yeah.
4979940	4983860	And like then I was like my other thing I would do in that game was like, look for real buildings
4983860	4989220	and try to recreate them, like, you know, like carriage houses, because I used to have this
4989220	4995620	dream that I would live in a carriage house. And so I made it in the Sims and then I make like
4995620	5001620	underground labyrinthine, you know, secret laboratories and shit and torture dungeons.
5002660	5003160	All right.
5003700	5004200	Yeah.
5004500	5005000	All right.
5005380	5005880	Alas.
5006820	5009700	I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next story because we are running a little long tonight,
5009700	5013700	so I'm going to do this one quickly because Loki kind of already talked about it,
5013700	5018180	but that's OK. I just want to mention quickly that they did confirm that Like a Dragon Eight
5018180	5022580	is coming out, and this is essentially for all intents and purposes Yakuza eight.
5022580	5026340	Let me talk about the difference in a moment. I'm sure some of you are already typing it in chat.
5026340	5032580	I will mention it in a moment. RGG Studio did a special presentation as part of Tokyo Game Show,
5032580	5037700	and they put out a teaser trailer and they did confirm the sequel is coming in 2024
5038660	5045860	on PlayStation, Xbox and PC. Kazuma Kiryu and Ichiban Kasuga are both in a dual protagonist
5045860	5050980	role in this game, with Kazuma supporting a Silver Fox hairstyle that will be explained in
5050980	5056740	the storyline as part of it. They referred to the game as an RPG, but outside of that, we don't know,
5056740	5062180	you know, specifically the gameplay style. They are saying it is the largest scale Yakuza or Like
5062180	5068420	a Dragon title to date. It will be available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so it is scale downable
5068420	5073300	for whatever that is worth. Also during the showcase, they did announce Like a Dragon
5073300	5077700	Isshin and Like a Dragon Gaiden, the man who erased his name. Both those games are coming
5077700	5085380	as well. So why is this Like a Dragon eight and not Yakuza eight? Well, it's basically because
5086260	5093380	Yakuza Like a Dragon was kind of like, ironically, also the seventh game in the series was kind of
5093380	5100180	like Resident Evil Biohazard. Like a Dragon is sort of what the series has been called in Japan
5100180	5105700	for years, not literally, but that's roughly what it translates to. But when they released the games
5105700	5110820	over here in the States, they gave it a new name to kind of fit in with a lot of the competing games
5110820	5115060	that were coming out at the time. They wanted it to have like the whole Japanese crime drama stuff,
5115060	5121620	so they called it Yakuza. And so that all happened that way. But now with Like a Dragon eight,
5121620	5126100	they are going to bring it in parody, basically. And so now, and I think this probably is going to
5126100	5131540	have to do with the style of the game changing as well. If they're talking about the RPG and
5131540	5138260	everything I had heard before, I thought they were going to keep the Like a Dragon seven stuff in it.
5138260	5143060	I hope they do because I far prefer that to the fighting game style of the earlier games. But
5144740	5151140	that's it. Yep, they're going to just closely align that with the Japanese name. So I'm very
5151700	5156180	curious to see more about Like a Dragon eight. And I'm sure people want to know,
5156180	5164740	am I going to finish Like a Dragon seven? We'll see. We'll see. I'm kind of,
5164740	5170260	friendship ended with Like a Dragon. Now Assassin's Creed Odyssey is my new best friend.
5173380	5180900	For now, I'm sure it'll change next week as it always does. All right. Moving on, Dark Sakura.
5182100	5186740	So, you know, I'm actually still wondering when I'm going to get my Dead by Daylight board game,
5186740	5193460	but it's not the only video game getting board games. Team Forged Games is doing
5194340	5200980	an Elden Ring board game. So it'll have miniatures of the game's enemies, the bosses,
5201620	5213700	Margit the Fel Omen. Sorry. But it will basically let one to four quote,
5213700	5224100	tarnished players go through their adventures on the board game. And a quote is that it's,
5224100	5228020	the game, the video games characteristically challenging fights will be recreated by
5228020	5233860	intelligent dice-free combat, requiring players to strategize and adapt their plans during each
5233860	5240580	encounter, whether that be a lowly Godric soldier or the Grafted King himself. I don't know what
5240580	5250900	they mean by dice-free, so maybe it'll use cards, but the Kickstarter. But the Kickstarter page
5250900	5255940	doesn't even have a date on it. It's just the Elden Ring board game. I'll link it in chat,
5255940	5260820	but it's just like, hi, we're doing this thing at some point.
5260820	5266020	Popular video games often get board games, but it's, I mean, that's not to say they're lesser
5266020	5270900	than or bad. You know, like I have some friends that love the Civ board game. Civilization has
5270900	5276100	a board game. They love it. So yeah, just pencil. I'd be curious to check out the Dead by Daylight
5276100	5281380	one when you get yours. I need to follow up on that. I don't know. I haven't heard anything
5281380	5283860	since I confirmed all my stuff for it. Interesting.
5284900	5287700	All right. Let's move on to some bummer news, Loki.
5288500	5296100	Yeah, we have more layoffs. So Fanbyte, which is a Tencent-owned gaming site, I guess,
5297140	5303460	they have fired staff without warning. And apparently according to a Fanbyte employee,
5303460	5312980	the layoffs were total shock. And some of those, some that had just been laid off, had been only
5312980	5320820	given like an hour notice. And also they said that I don't know the total number of employees
5320820	5326340	that were laid off there, but there were at least several mentioned that had lost their jobs.
5326340	5331220	It was most of the staff. It sounds like they're keeping people that do the evergreen content,
5331220	5334660	like strategy guides and stuff like that. And that's probably where they're going to
5334660	5339060	try to get their hits. But it sounds like the news part of it is, from what I'm gathering,
5339060	5344420	I have a Twitter buddy who was impacted with this and it's a bummer to hear about.
5345700	5355140	Yeah. And then was it G4 TV also laid off 20 to 30 staff members as well. Now this doesn't
5355140	5359140	mean that they're going to be cutting down on content. They're going to still be producing the
5359140	5365060	same slate of content. It's just, they said this was due to unforeseen, well, I'm sorry,
5365060	5370660	this was due to their growing, I guess. They said it ebbs and flows something to that.
5370660	5372260	They're growing so they have to cut back.
5373380	5374900	Yeah. I don't understand how that works.
5376340	5380420	The Comcast board isn't making enough money, so we have to get it from somewhere.
5382100	5388740	I don't know. Like I haven't really been following G4 to be honest. I know that sounds
5388740	5393700	harsh. I know people that are there too. I'm sorry. Again, it's not a reflection on anyone
5393700	5396660	or anything personally, but it is one of those things where it's like, I just think
5397700	5405620	a TV channel like that now, the world in 2022 is not what it was in 2000. What was the merger of
5405620	5412260	tech TVs, 2006 or something like that? It's not the same world. It's pre-YouTube, pre-Twitch.
5413060	5415620	Like it's a different world we live in now.
5415620	5420980	You know, and it was, yeah, it was just back then it was easier to see it because
5421940	5426660	it was like having an exclusive YouTube channel, a single YouTube channel that basically gave you
5426660	5430900	your gaming news. And so, yeah, it was super popular because there wasn't really anything
5430900	5436660	out there like that outside of like gaming magazines. But nowadays with the internet,
5436660	5441140	anybody out there, there's so many outlets, anybody could give you the gaming news.
5441540	5446260	G4, isn't G4 also kind of a pain in the ass to watch? Like you have to have the special
5446260	5452340	Xfinity internet channel box or something to get it. Like I know some content is online,
5452340	5462500	but it almost feels like it's hard to get a hold of anyway. I don't know. But honestly,
5462500	5466180	I'm not really looking for it except for some of the viral moments, which actually,
5466180	5473220	and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, there are a lot of the internet that blames it on the one
5473220	5478740	rant the woman made about misogyny in quotes. Well, when you insult your audience, then expect
5478740	5487620	to get laid off. In the words of the wonderful Gordon Ramsey, oh, fuck off. Like just shut up,
5487620	5491060	Twitter. You do not know what the fuck you're talking about because number one,
5491620	5498900	did she get laid off? I don't think so. And number two, that was actually the moment that
5498900	5505940	made me go, oh, I should be paying attention to this over here. G4 probably needs more viral
5505940	5514260	moments like that to be quite honest. So armchair critics who can't stand hearing the truth,
5514340	5516660	if you can't stand hearing the truth,
5520820	5525540	just don't. Yeah. It's just, it's a hard sell nowadays, especially with cable stuff. Like most
5525540	5531300	people are cutting cable and even just still like scream, scream into the void of your three actual
5531300	5537620	followers and your 45 Russia bots. God, like, like I've got like Comcast cable. I don't have their
5537620	5542340	box obviously. Cause why would I pay extra for their stupid box? Um, so there's like, yeah,
5542340	5548180	I don't even know how we'd watch their content outside of what I see like on Twitter. Um,
5548820	5553460	and even then I'm like, not really motivated to watch any of it. Like I used to love G4, but like,
5554340	5557940	yeah, I used to, that was a long time ago. Now there's other things I like watching.
5558900	5564420	So it's hard. Zen monkey 11 in chat. Sorry. I just want to Zen monkey 11 and chat says
5564420	5569940	G4 viewers since relaunch. Uh, they are on Twitch, YouTube, Pluto TV. They're on everything.
5569940	5575380	You can watch Pluto and watch. They do the shows live on Twitch and YouTube.
5575380	5580980	Uh, and then tiger class says it's on YouTube TV and Pluto TV has a channel called G4 TV select.
5580980	5586340	See, but that's like, I have to be honest. Like it sounds like it's completely different on YouTube,
5586900	5592260	Twitch, maybe those are the same thing, but then we have G4 TV select. So that sounds different
5592260	5596180	than, than the actual station like that. Like, look, and I'm not, again, I'm not knocking it.
5596180	5600020	I'm not knocking the fans, but I'm just saying that's a little confusing.
5600660	5606020	Then G4 TV. Is that like live TV or is that just like replaying the old shows?
5606020	5610820	It sounds like replaying the old shows, but do I really know? I don't know. Uh,
5610820	5614740	Bobby black Wolf and chat says my mom's house has it. And I turned it on once attack of the
5614740	5619140	show was on and it looked like a podcast being recorded. Three people sitting around mics and
5619140	5629780	laptops. Well, now who would watch that? But to be fair, I think a lot of pandemic stuff
5629780	5634020	kind of changed that, but grant, I get it's 2022. And you know, a lot of that stuff's about.
5635300	5640820	Wasn't the show that they had, um, didn't they have a show with, um, Scott Rubin
5641460	5645780	that was three people around microphones or something like that. Wasn't like the G4 TV.
5646580	5651060	I don't remember what it was called, but they were all in the same room.
5651060	5652500	Remember when it was cool to do that?
5654260	5656100	Oh, it's all remote now still. Right.
5656740	5660100	I think, well, I don't think there is a G4 TV show anymore.
5662180	5666900	Bobby black was talking about attack of the show, which was the, essentially the spinoff of, um,
5668820	5672020	thank you. Screen savers. I was like Leo, the poor tech TV. Yeah. That one,
5672020	5676500	not, not the other one, which that, that other show that Scott was on with the, um,
5676500	5680340	the gals that went to go work at Microsoft, uh, that that show has been long gone.
5680340	5684500	I miss this. I mean, I don't miss the screen savers. Cause I know that, that I think that
5684500	5688740	still exists or maybe it doesn't exist. They, they had it a new, the new screensavers at one time,
5688740	5694260	but I don't watch that anymore. But, um, man, I miss the old screen savers though,
5694260	5699620	that that was some good TV. Uh, Zen monkey 11 says, think of it like big brother.
5699620	5703140	You have the live feeds with all the cool content like Twitch and YouTube.
5703140	5707940	And then you have the CBS show Comcast. That's actually actually Zen monkey to give you credit.
5707940	5713380	That's a great way of putting it. And maybe that's the kind of approach G4 needs to take
5713380	5716180	and marketing it. So I'm not saying they have to literally compare themselves to big brother,
5716180	5721540	but maybe, you know, the uncensored stuff is online. I don't know. Or maybe they're doing it.
5721540	5725540	And I'm just not, I'm too old to be the target marketing demographic. And I've never seen these
5725540	5730180	ads. I don't know, but I'm just, just thinking this landscape, I'm not going to be surprised
5730180	5737860	that they fold in three years. Like honestly, like it's hard, you know, like, um, I don't know,
5737860	5743380	but like, I would not be surprised if that happens because it's just, it's like trying to keep a
5743380	5749380	gaming magazine up in this day and age. It's just, you can't, you can't compete with it.
5749380	5754580	And I'm sorry, like, like their, their personalities are great. Like I love,
5754580	5760820	you know, Adam, um, what was it? Uh, I love Adam. What's his name? Sessler.
5761620	5766260	Sessler. Yes. Sorry. I had all these other names. I'm like, it's, it's not Sandler. Don't say
5766260	5774180	Sandler. I know it's not a Sandler. Like I can see his face. Um, yeah. Adam Sussler. Um, you know,
5775140	5780820	I just, I don't know. Like, like I was fine with it being gone and just like keeping up with him
5780820	5785460	on Twitter and stuff instead. Like I just don't need it to come back. But like, I mean,
5786340	5790420	it has its fans, you know, Zen monkey saying it's been around like three years. They're good. People
5790420	5794100	don't just didn't know cause they weren't on cable. So they need cable in a way at
5794100	5802740	that part. I disagree with, there are cable is a dying brand. So this is why I would say it's good
5802740	5809300	that G4 has a presence on places like Pluto TV, streaming things like, like YouTube and Twitch
5809300	5815620	and so forth. Cable television is about to be a thing of the past. And once 5g is more widely
5815620	5821460	available, that's going to be the death knell for cable. So that is where G4 is doing the right
5821460	5826740	thing by being on these other places as well for when cable inevitably dies. It's going to.
5826740	5832180	So, you know, just wait. All right. Anyhow, we got to move on with the show. Uh, I don't want to,
5832180	5834820	I don't want to be here all night, but you know, I'm finding here a little bit of the night,
5834820	5839700	but I want to talk about the sweet code and HD remaster, which came a little bit out of left
5839700	5844500	field. I don't think people were really expecting this. Uh, Konami put on a show at Tokyo game show.
5844500	5849620	They talked about a beloved series, uh, worldwide coming back and many people assumed it was going
5849620	5856340	to be silent Hill. Although I sure didn't, but I did think Konami would say it was something else.
5856340	5861140	I'd be like, Oh, it's gyrus come in, which I do love gyrus, but I thought that was what they
5861140	5864500	were going to do is like, Oh, it's like, or Contra or something that they've already tried to relaunch
5864500	5869060	and relatively recently, I actually think it's pretty cool. They are bringing back sweet code.
5869060	5873220	And it's not just sweet code. What the whole, they started just talking about sweet code one.
5873220	5877300	And then it was like, Oh, but it's sweet code and two as well. So it's a sweet code and one and two
5877300	5884580	HD remaster it's coming out for PlayStation four X-Box one switch and PC in 2023. A lot of people
5884580	5890180	have aptly noticed. Wow. Right around the time I had in Chronicles is also set to release. Isn't
5890180	5896980	that interesting? Um, so, you know, we've seen some of the, uh, we've seen a trailer,
5896980	5901860	we've seen that there's graphical improvements. There's new like lighting cloud, shadow animation,
5901860	5905860	new character drawings, sound improvements. They're saying game system improvements and
5905860	5912260	so on and so on. This is all fine and good. I I'm very happy to see sweet code and getting love
5912260	5916980	because this series has needed love for a long time. It's a real bummer that Konami kind of let
5916980	5924260	it die off. Like they did just about everything else because Konami sucks. That is also why I'm
5924260	5931300	concerned is that in all of this announcement and hype and stuff, I didn't see any other logos.
5932340	5938900	And what that means is I didn't see digital clips and two or any of these other companies who are
5938900	5943780	using Inti creates or these companies that are kind of used to taking older games and making
5943780	5950020	them HD. None of that. So this appears to be a Konami in-house production.
5958260	5964900	Now I'm going to hit, someone hit the lever, this wrong lever show time. Now look,
5966340	5971860	the Suikoden fans, and there are many out there and they are passionate, are quick to say that
5971940	5978420	the trailer looks good and I'm sure everything will be fine. Look, I'm rooting for this game.
5978420	5982980	I really am. Believe me, no one wants to see this game succeed more than me. Okay,
5982980	5986660	maybe a lot of people want to see this game succeed as much as me, but I really do want
5986660	5994820	this to be good. However, if I have concerns that the company behind the the notorious game
5994820	6002660	E-Football is doing this HD remaster, I have every fucking right to be concerned about this
6002660	6009300	game. The Secret of Mana HD remaster looked really cool at first as well. They did an HD
6009300	6015380	port of Final Fantasy 6 for mobile devices before the pixel remasters. And do you remember the,
6016500	6022820	they were bad, but they looked all right in the trailer. So look, I'm just saying I'm going to
6022820	6029300	need to see some reviews, some serious gameplay. I'm going to need to see a little more about what
6029300	6034740	this game actually looks like before I really get excited because the fact that Konami is developing
6034740	6043300	it in-house, yeah, sorry. It's a red flag for me at this point. Especially considering that even
6043460	6051940	like more polished studios like Rockstar Games, for example, some of the stuff that they've
6052740	6059140	remastered hasn't turned out well because of the quality of employees that they put in that,
6059140	6063460	or your companies that they hired to do that. So Christ, I don't know, Konami in-house.
6064420	6068980	Orange right hit the nail on the fucking head. I can't even believe I didn't think of this one.
6068980	6076820	The most obvious Konami HD remaster to raise every red flag you own. I was looking forward
6076820	6087300	to the Silent Hill HD remaster and then it happened. I mean, case point, the prostitution
6087300	6100900	rests. That's it. Anyway, so yes, I have concerns. I hope I'm wrong. I really do. I hope Konami paid
6100900	6106180	somebody a lot of money to secretly help them. I really do. They don't have a lot of money to pay
6106180	6114500	anybody. And that's my concerns. All right. Anyway, let's go back maybe to a simpler time
6114500	6119540	in our next segment. You know, back in a time like when Konami actually made good games.
6121540	6122340	So long ago.
6130260	6135780	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
6135780	6140660	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
6141300	6147460	But once a month Dark Sakura says I'm doing a handheld, not a game. So what's the handheld Dark
6147460	6160740	Sakura? They're games. I mean, yeah. Anyway, we are doing the series, the Tomitronic 3D. They
6161700	6169860	kind of look like view masters, but longer and more spaceship sort of. And they have a light
6169860	6175700	panel on top. Well, just like a translucent panel on top that lets light come in and illuminates the
6175700	6183460	screen. And there were seven games released. There was, and they had different names. So we had
6184420	6193700	Sky Fighters, also known as Dog Fight and Tandy Sky Duel. We had Thundering Turbo, also known as
6193700	6202900	Cosmos LeMans Turbo Racer and Thundering Turbos. Sky Attack, AKA Tank Attack. Shark Attack or Jaws
6202900	6210580	3D. Planet Zeon, AKA Space Laser War, Space Attack. Then Jungle Fighter and Sherman Attack.
6211300	6222420	The names really varied on their regions. But basically the game was just built right into
6222420	6231060	the system. It was actually a fairly decent mock-up of 3D the way that they had it set up.
6231060	6238260	In fact, I think that the one we're looking at right now is one of the turbo ones. And I think
6238260	6245140	that it looked pretty good for its time. Here's the Tank Attack. I think I have another one of
6245140	6255300	the variation for the Sky Attack. But I think that the games, for when they came out, it was
6255300	6265060	as close to actual VR as we were going to get. And it was, in 1983, this was the first dedicated home
6265620	6278340	3D hardware. So it used twin LCD monitors. And I mean, for 1983, it was something else.
6278340	6283860	It was something else. And you can see that probably some of the influence of this came from
6285220	6290100	a lot of the different sci-fi around the time. Like Tron had come out around then.
6290660	6300980	So, but I don't know. I think it's something that people need to remember that without this,
6301540	6308420	where would we have our Wipeout and our other games like that.
6309780	6316580	Yeah, stuff like this was like the shit in the early 80s. It was so cool. If you had one of
6316580	6322660	these, I don't remember this one particularly, but obviously there are several electronic
6322660	6330500	handhelds in a similar vein, we'll say, from in the 80s. And even now I'm looking at the ones that
6330500	6334020	have the Tron aesthetic to it that you were just talking about, we were just seeing in the video.
6334020	6338580	And I'm like, that game looks cool. I would have been the coolest kid in school if I had
6338580	6343860	that in the 80s and brought that to school. It really does give you the sense of depth
6343860	6353860	and motion, even though it's, and the light is all coming from outside, just linking on the
6353860	6358020	screen. I was reading that people would come and put their hands over it and then you couldn't see
6358020	6370980	the game. But I mean, there it is, the Tommytronic 3D from 1983. And I made the video myself,
6370980	6374420	you're welcome. There you go. So for those watching on Twitch tonight with the video,
6374420	6378260	or if you're in the archives, which are subscribers, it is September after all,
6378260	6383140	so I should give a shout out for our subscribers over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork. You can go
6383140	6387620	back and watch an old episode anytime if you want. If you want to see the video or what have you,
6388500	6396260	that's available as a bonus to subscribers in our archive. And Amazon Twitch is currently having a
6396260	6401300	sale on subscriptions for September. So now is as good of a time as any to get on that.
6401300	6405940	And if you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you already get one free subscription a month. So
6405940	6410420	if you're not already using that to help your favorite indie creator, why don't you consider
6410420	6419140	using it over at Vognetwork? For the record, I remember hearing of someone who took a little
6419140	6424180	flashlight and taped it on top of their thing so they could play at night under the covers.
6426340	6432100	Oh, the systems we had when we were kids to play things. Same thing with the original Game Boy.
6432660	6436660	It's like remember, remember the original Game Boy did not have any type of backlight or anything
6436660	6441460	like that. But they actually sold like those screen magnifiers with a shitty little light
6441460	6446260	that you could like clip onto the top of the DS. And all it did was make glare. I used to just
6446260	6452020	sneak into the bathroom and play at night. That's great. Or the snake light says orange,
6452020	6456820	right? Oh, yeah. God, those are terrible. But we did what we did what we had to do.
6457460	6461540	Well, you know, my my GBA had we finally put the afterburner in it.
6462900	6467780	Because mine was the clear pink one, which I just got for, you know, being a little, you know,
6467780	6475300	ironic. It made my whole system glow. I love those Game Boy advances with the afterburners in them
6475300	6483460	looked so good. So good. Yeah. Yeah, I think that Tim did all of our our friend Tim did all of our
6483460	6489300	upgrades for our GBAs. I had a different friend who I haven't talked to in a very,
6489300	6492900	very long time. Unfortunately, he used to hang out in the earlier days, OLR. But just, you know,
6492900	6496500	if we grew apart or whatever, who did mine? I think it was like a birthday present at one point.
6496500	6504660	So, yeah. All right. Anyhow, let's travel around and check out some other news going on in the
6504660	6511620	industry. Some rapid fire news. Loki will start with the US. I'm sorry, not my eyes were on world
6511620	6515300	release dates. We can start with some news from the US too, though, if you want. I don't know
6515300	6517220	where this news is from. But once you get to it,
6518020	6523780	well, it's it's gonna be or not. I mean, so in this case, I guess it's sort of from the US
6523780	6531780	because it's about the Xbox Game Pass. So Deathloop it's been almost a year now. You know
6531780	6537940	what that means? Exclusive contract is up with Sony. So now it's coming to Xbox Game Pass on
6537940	6543140	September 20th. And it's also going to have a new content update called Golden Loop, which comes out
6543140	6550740	the same day, adding new abilities and extended ending and secrets. And also, Deathloop will be
6550740	6558820	getting added to PlayStation Plus Extra as well. Yeah, so that's cool. I'll have to check it out
6558820	6565460	when it comes out. And then this is kind of funny. I actually saw a clip of this on Twitter.
6565460	6572980	It's Rose and Camellia. It is a game about slapping, or it's ladies slapping each other.
6574740	6579860	And it's Japanese only. With gloves. Well, some of them have gloves. I think most of them have
6579860	6585540	gloves. Gloves slap, baby gloves slap. Anyone? Remember when the Simpsons was good? Anyone?
6585540	6592260	All right. So it was a game. It's been out for a long time. I think
6594260	6598980	it's been, it's a Japanese game. So it is only coming out on the Switch there,
6598980	6605220	but it's hilarious because you use the Switch Joy-Cons to actually do the motion control for
6605220	6610020	the slap, which is hilarious. That's why I wanted to mention it. All right.
6610900	6614900	Dark Sakura, please don't slap me with a glove while you do your rapid fire story.
6615940	6622900	Well, there is a Gran Turismo movie with David Harbour being produced and Orlando
6622900	6634020	Bloom has joined the cast. So that's really it. Although he's also, his character is going to be
6634020	6641220	a marketing executive who loves motor sports and Harbour is playing a retired driver who teaches
6641940	6649380	a young person to be a race car driver. I also have another little thing real quick.
6649380	6656820	Yeah, sure. Someone put out a mod for Mass Effect 2 called the Nos Astra
6657780	6665540	a Nos Astra mineral exchange that lets you actually have a stock market for your mined goods
6666820	6672180	created by Team Pyjak and Bekatoria. It's on Nexus.
6672820	6674580	All right. It's for the legendary edition.
6675380	6680820	All right. All right. Well, I don't know why I'm talking about this in rapid fire news,
6680820	6685540	because this is right up your alley, Dark Sakura. I'm sorry. This thing has your name
6685540	6690100	all over it. Oh, I've already known about it and linked it to Dan.
6691700	6695540	So for everybody else, here's what I'm talking about. It is yet another
6695540	6700900	console mini coming out, but what obscure shit are they going to do next?
6701860	6708980	Obscure here. Yes, obscure here. Key point. But in Japan, after all, it is Tokyo Game Show week,
6708980	6718020	they have announced that the X68000 is going to be getting a mini. It's the X68000Z. It's about
6718020	6720900	two-fifths the scale of the original machine. And this is a machine-
6720900	6722020	This is a Suzuki.
6722020	6727460	Yeah. And it never came out here in the States, as we've referenced before. And not only is there
6727460	6735140	the small model there, you can even get a mouse and keyboard for it. Yeah, exactly. This is a
6735860	6744180	system that came out in Japan in March of 1987. This was the home of some arcade perfect ports
6744180	6750340	like Parodius, Final Fight, Ghouls and Ghosts, Castlevania Chronicles. This was the original
6750340	6755060	platform for that. There was a remake of Castlevania on the NES with updated visuals.
6755060	6760020	They did put it on the PlayStation later, but still, it was really cool that this is out there.
6760020	6769300	So yeah, this is awesome. Again, for the US, extremely niche thing, but for those in the know,
6769940	6771780	very cool. Very cool.
6771780	6775140	And it looks like it's coming out on the 8th.
6775700	6778820	Yeah, it's coming out really soon, all things considered.
6778820	6779220	Yeah.
6779220	6780740	I like how it has a clarion handle.
6782340	6784020	Oh, because the original did.
6784020	6785860	Yeah. This is awesome.
6786740	6788180	I need-
6788180	6792580	I know. I kind of want it too, even though I wish-
6792580	6794500	We need someone to order it for us.
6797300	6801780	We need a collective sugar daddy or mommy or person.
6802420	6805540	I'm trying to see how much it's going to be because I don't know that it's going to be
6805540	6808180	super... Okay, there we go.
6808180	6811860	Well, it would depend if you get the keyboard, mouse and all the bells and whistles.
6811860	6817620	I'm looking at the limited edition to see what the price isn't anywhere on the blog.
6817620	6819940	I don't think that's a mouse. I think that's a trackball.
6820500	6820900	It is.
6821460	6822260	Oh, my bad.
6824180	6828820	Sorry, they used the mouse emoji and that's what it translated to, so that's what I read. Sorry,
6828820	6829460	but yeah.
6829460	6830500	It looks like a trackball.
6830500	6832580	Yeah, it's a really oddly shaped mouse.
6832580	6833060	Yeah.
6833060	6837380	The price isn't on here. Hold on. Let me look at the tweet real quick.
6838820	6842740	Well, let me just read some comments over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
6842740	6845860	Dark Tetsuya says, this is cool. I want one. Fingers crossed-
6845860	6847300	That's the announcement date, by the way.
6848020	6850180	Fingers crossed the version of Castlevania comes with it.
6851380	6851700	Orange-
6853300	6857060	Just from the tweet, it says, details will be announced on 10.8 and reservations will
6857060	6857940	start on the same day.
6857940	6862660	Oh, okay. So that's just the... That's an announcement of an announcement. All right.
6863860	6867780	Orange Right says, I saw this on Retro Pals, had a lot of great Capcom arcade ports,
6867780	6868580	among other things.
6869140	6874900	DJ Rama S says, River City Ransom was on it too. Yeah, so what a fitting tribute.
6874900	6875400	Yeah.
6876580	6879540	The Nikketsu Downtown fight.
6879540	6884020	Yeah, the original name, of course. All right, let's move on. And now we can do some world
6884020	6887140	release dates. And now we'll start with the US Loki.
6888100	6893540	Yeah, so very exciting week. We're starting off with Return to Monkey Island on PC and
6893540	6900900	Nintendo Switch. I will definitely be picking that up. There is no light on PC.
6900900	6901860	There are four lights.
6903140	6903640	Nevermind.
6904440	6905400	Stop it with your Star Trek references.
6905400	6905900	I got it.

7072360	7075960	All right, well, heading over to Japan, some similar stuff to what Loki had just mentioned
7075960	7079720	there, because in Japan, Taeko no Tatsujin Rhythm Festival is coming out on the Switch,
7079720	7082680	much to a Mike Deff's delight, although I don't know if he imports those things.
7083480	7085720	The Dial Field Chronicle is out.
7085720	7090680	It's an English release, but it is available on the Switch in Japan, a local release.
7091320	7094840	Valise, The Phantasm Soldier Collection 2, also out on the Switch.
7095720	7102200	Loki already mentioned it, but that Jayuzenge and Getsusangokuden 1 and 2 is out in a regular
7102200	7105400	and limited edition on the Switch this week in Japan.
7105400	7107080	No Place for Bravery.
7107080	7112200	It's not translated, but it is still being released in Japan this week as well as Potion
7112280	7116840	Permit and Valise, The Phantasm Soldier Collection 2.
7116840	7117720	Why is this listed twice?
7117720	7119240	Oh, because there's a regular limited edition.
7119240	7120200	That was the limited edition.
7120200	7120600	My bad.
7122440	7122920	Let's see.
7123720	7128920	Going over to the PlayStation 5, and we have the Dial Field Chronicle is out there on the
7128920	7135480	PlayStation 5 as well, and Necromunda Hired Gun, again, it's in English, but it is getting
7135480	7140760	an official release in Japan on the 22nd of September, along with Potion Permit also
7140760	7142200	on the PlayStation 5.
7142760	7144040	So there you go.
7144040	7145480	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
7146680	7148120	So, of course, a handful.
7148760	7154680	On the 20th, we have Stray for PlayStation, Thuls Deluxe Edition.
7155960	7161160	They misspelled edition, I think, for PlayStation and Xbox.
7161160	7164280	And for the same, we also have Construction Simulator.
7164280	7170200	On the 22nd, for the three consoles, we have the Dial Field Chronicle, PlayStation and
7170200	7172280	Xbox, we have Sessions Skate Sim.

7187960	7191800	And then for the three, we have Dragons Legends of the Nine Realms.
7193800	7194300	All right.
7195240	7199800	We just have a few more stories for you, and then we'll open up the listener roundtable
7199800	7204920	via our mailbag, which is participate at orangeontrader.com, as well as our Twitter
7204920	7208200	at O-L-R, and even some phone calls.
7208200	7211800	You can join our Discord server and continue the conversation throughout the week over,
7212360	7216040	excuse me, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7216040	7229640	That's what I get for drinking coke during the show.
7229880	7233320	All right, let's move on with a few more stories.
7233320	7233820	Loki.
7234440	7242600	Yes, so I hate to tell you this, all you Babylon's Fall fans out there, but they're
7242600	7243800	shutting the game down.
7244440	7247080	So the servers are gonna be shut off February 2023.
7248360	7250680	Apparently, the game was not all that popular.
7250680	7259480	And it says, today we've revealed new information about version 1.0 and the future of Babylon
7260200	7260840	development.
7262120	7268440	After the service ends Monday, February 27th, 2023, 11pm Pacific time, you'll no longer
7268440	7269320	be able to play the game.
7270520	7274680	All gameplay data on the game servers will be deleted following the termination of the
7274680	7275400	service.
7275400	7277000	It was a $60 game.
7277000	7278200	It lasted less than a year.
7280120	7281960	Live services, the future of gaming.
7282120	7283240	But up, up, up, up, up.
7286920	7289240	I was gonna say, what went wrong with Babylon's Fall?
7289240	7290600	But honestly, I never played it.
7290600	7291640	I couldn't tell you.
7291640	7293960	I think I've never heard of it.
7293960	7298760	I think this was the game that recycled some of the Final Fantasy 14 assets.
7298760	7299240	It sure did.
7299240	7302760	But I don't think that's that big of a deal.
7302760	7308840	Like, it just sounds like the game was a very obvious sort of games as a service kind of
7308840	7309240	thing.
7309240	7311400	And I think, I don't know.
7311400	7314760	I think gamers have just had their fill of a lot of these, and it's probably hard to
7314760	7317240	shove an original IP out there with this at this point.
7317240	7318440	But we'll see.
7320280	7321640	All right, moving on.
7321640	7322360	Dark Sakura.
7323800	7329880	So there already is a little bit of controversy around the multiverses game.
7331000	7337640	Velma, her power is being changed in the game because she has the ability to call the police.
7337640	7345800	And since there are black characters in the game, it has definitely, especially in light
7345800	7352600	of, you know, past white women calling the police for people, you know, doing a barbecue
7352600	7354120	in a public park, for example.
7354840	7358920	You know, birds, watering flowers.
7361080	7364040	She has been referred to as a Karen in the game.
7364600	7372520	And so the response is that they're going to change her power from being like a big
7372520	7379160	snitch and Karen to, you know, actually doing something different.
7379160	7383560	And they say that her abilities changed Thursday.
7383560	7388200	Instead of calling the police, Velma now solves the mystery and calls the mystery ink gang
7388200	7391080	and mystery machine to take the bad guys away.
7391640	7394440	They just replaced the cop car with the mystery machine car.
7394440	7397960	But it still reads a lot better than it did before.
7399160	7406200	Well, to keep going back out, Warner Brothers Interactive said that it was welcomed by some
7406200	7411320	players that, you know, and in fact, one person on Twitter, I'm going to read the quote because
7411320	7416040	it's apt, Velma got updated to multiverses and now she doesn't call the cops, which good
7416040	7418280	they shouldn't have gotten there to begin with.
7418280	7420840	She calls the mystery machine now, which just makes more sense.
7421480	7427560	Um, and people are saying that they like how responsive the developers are being, but not
7427560	7428760	everyone really likes it.
7429640	7433880	Another person says, I'm sick of the whole Velma is a Karen narrative that has come out
7433880	7434680	of multiverses.
7434680	7438920	Velma actually does her research and collects evidence before calling the cops on her opponents.
7438920	7440200	She's clearly not a Karen.
7440840	7448440	Honestly, though, they're missing the point that she is calling the police on, you know,
7448440	7449800	black characters in the game.
7449800	7455080	I mean, it's every character in the game, but it's specific that she, you know, that
7455080	7462360	there is a definite societal connotation there that isn't the type of message we should be
7462360	7463160	sending out there.
7463160	7470120	There's this thing called optics and reading the room and the room was red and yeah.
7470120	7474840	And that doesn't, they don't, it just shouldn't have been there.
7474840	7475240	Yeah.
7475720	7479960	It's the, the only, the only criticism I have about this, I just have one minor, I don't,
7479960	7483800	I don't care that they, well, actually I think it's good that they replaced the, uh, uh,
7483800	7485320	cop car with the mystery machine.
7485320	7489400	My one complaint is that when the mystery machine opens up to put the play or the other
7489400	7492120	player in there, a cloud of smoke should be coming out of the car.
7492120	7495880	That's my only complaint, uh, is that they miss that opportunity with the mystery machine.
7495880	7497080	It is a level of realism.
7497080	7499720	That's just the person in there and hot box them.
7500600	7502440	They don't care about doing it anymore.
7502440	7503080	Exactly.
7504040	7505320	That's my complaint.
7505320	7506440	Otherwise, yeah.
7507240	7507640	All right.
7508280	7509160	Let's move on.
7509160	7512040	Just a few more stories for you and then we'll get to the listener round table.
7512040	7512540	Loki.
7513640	7514140	All right.
7516280	7520840	I mean, I am really not surprised when it comes to this company, but Ubisoft is going
7520840	7529560	to be adapting or adopting a $70 price tag model for their major releases because they
7529640	7537880	feel that these games on PlayStation four as well from PlayStation five and Xbox series X.
7538840	7541960	So I don't think it mentioned anything about PlayStation four.
7542920	7545480	I don't even know if these games are coming out on PlayStation four.
7546200	7553480	Um, but yeah, not excited about it, especially when you have these companies that put out
7553480	7558120	games, you know, that this price point and the games are still unpolished.
7558120	7560440	You know, I'm, I don't know.
7560440	7562440	I don't think it's worth it, but you know what?
7563160	7565880	You have to look at your wallet and see if it's worth it.
7565880	7568440	Here's a great new technique when it comes to these games.
7569160	7575000	You just wait two years and then they go on Xbox game pass and then you don't pay anything.
7575880	7577400	Well, I mean, you're paying your game pass.
7577400	7582760	I don't pay anything more, but honestly, if you know how to work that Microsoft rewards
7582760	7587400	program, which I I've kind of fallen off the map from doing, I was a lot better at it before.
7587400	7592600	I was, I was getting a lot of my months of game pass comped by just like, you know,
7593320	7595320	doing all the surveys and all that crap.
7595320	7600760	So I honestly, you probably could work the system and get it for free if you actually
7600760	7602520	are willing to do that.
7603000	7608520	Um, I would say with minimal effort, you could probably get every third month comped, uh,
7608520	7611720	with fairly minimal effort, as long as you check in that app once in a while.
7611720	7616840	But yeah, there was this additional money going to, uh, fund the people that will be
7616840	7622680	looking into ease, come on for all the, uh, propagating of bad culture at the company
7622680	7623960	and all the sexual harassment.
7623960	7625240	Is any of that money going to that?
7626520	7631880	Uh, sadly, I don't think it is, uh, but that's a very fair call out that you, uh, bring up
7631880	7632440	there.
7632440	7637240	So, I mean, I feel that, you know, a company with those kinds of quality standards, uh,
7637240	7640200	within the company certainly is worth an extra $10.
7640200	7643560	I mean, clearly they've, they've addressed all the issues.
7643560	7643800	Yes.
7643800	7646520	I'll pay an extra $10 for your game when you fire ease, come on.
7647800	7650760	That's, that's the $10 decision that needs to be made.
7650760	7651080	Yes.
7651080	7656040	I realize shareholders and that's probably not really going to happen.
7656040	7656680	It needs to.
7657480	7657800	All right.
7658520	7661720	Anyway, meantime, I'll tell you what you can spend your money on.
7662840	7668440	If you want to do a value in gaming, I'll tell you what.
7670200	7673560	Whoever has the rights to Garfield boy.
7673560	7674200	Oh boy.
7674200	7679240	The people that come up with these Garfield games, they could not come up with an original
7679240	7682120	idea to, to, to save their life.
7682120	7687400	Let me tell you, if somebody had a gun to their head and said, Hey, Garfield people,
7687400	7689480	you need to come up with original idea.
7689480	7690280	Well, guess what?
7690280	7696280	This week it was announced Garfield lasagna party is coming out bang because it's just
7696280	7699400	a rip off of Mario party basically.
7699400	7700600	And that's what's coming out.
7701640	7705800	But it's coming out on PlayStation five, all the Xbox consoles, of course, PS four,
7705800	7707800	Xbox one, switch and PC.
7707800	7710120	It's launching in November.
7710120	7710680	That's right.
7710680	7716040	You can play party games with Garfield, Odie, Arlene, Nirmal.
7716040	7719000	I don't know if the rest of the U S acres characters are there.
7719000	7724920	I wonder if, if Greg is doing any of the voices, if they bring in like the U S acres characters.
7725800	7726680	Yeah, no idea.
7726680	7728600	And I don't, I only see those four.
7728600	7732840	They just say, play us one of the four iconic characters from Jim Davis's iconic comics.
7732840	7736600	So they don't say anything about the, um, the other characters.
7736600	7743800	So we'll see, uh, maybe there'll be DLC, uh, uh, dynamic party game filled with crazy
7743800	7745240	and tasty mini games.
7745240	7749400	You can tell this is just a copy paste and press release, uh, pizza square, slicing
7749400	7753720	challenge, snowballs, throwing competition, obstacle race, and more.
7754440	7765400	I'm sure this game is going to be unique and never before seen and just groundbreaking.
7766760	7767640	Anyway, there you go.
7767640	7769000	Lasagna party.
7769000	7773160	Uh, I agree with Zen monkey and chat who says we need Heathcliff games.
7773160	7773560	Yes.
7773560	7774120	Yes, we do.
7775720	7780840	Heathcliff in the, uh, that Nintendo all star brawl thing, or is it just Garfield?
7780840	7783720	Nintendo all star brawl.
7785000	7785160	Yeah.
7785160	7787720	I thought they had like a Nintendo one with all the Nicktoons stuff.
7788280	7790440	Oh, then it's the Nickelodeon.
7790440	7790760	Also.
7790760	7792120	No, I think just Garfield's in that.
7792120	7792440	I'm sorry.
7793400	7795720	I was thinking Nickelodeon brothers.
7795720	7796120	What?
7796120	7797240	No, no, no.
7797240	7802600	I was thinking Nickelodeon for some reason said Nintendo, but, um, yeah.
7802600	7806920	In the Nickelodeon game, that's where they should throw it on.
7806920	7809400	They could have a throw it on between Garfield and Heathcliff.
7809960	7812120	Uh, tiger class says we need eek the cat.
7812120	7813480	I could sign up for that.
7813480	7814040	Oh my God.
7814040	7814760	Eek the cat.
7814760	7819080	I just, I want some more like old school Nickelodeon fucking base.
7819080	7822600	And I'm talking, they need to go even deeper for us forties.
7822600	7824440	They need to go even deeper on set.
7824440	7830760	Like we need some, we need, we need more Canadian television that they repackaged on
7830760	7832360	Nickelodeon for the America.
7832360	7834200	I'm talking today special.
7834200	7836760	I'm talking pinwheel special.
7836760	7838360	You can't do that on television.
7839160	7840040	Let's get some Mr.
7840040	7841000	Wizard up in there.
7841560	7847320	I want, I want moose as a playable character in the Nickelodeon game and, and, uh, Lisa
7847320	7848120	ruddy.
7848120	7855160	I want, um, fucking Eureka's castle, Turkey television, duckula, duckula.
7857240	7859160	I want it all 1990s tomorrow.
7859160	7861240	People got a danger mouse.
7862120	7863800	Christ, y'all are on a roll.
7864840	7867720	That's, that's the Nickelodeon all stars game we deserve.
7867800	7871560	Like, is there a code I can put in on the menu to unlock danger mouse?
7871560	7872520	Is that a thing I can do?
7873320	7874840	Welcome freshman.
7874840	7875560	Oh my God.
7875560	7878600	Like your, your talent should be penfold.
7878600	7883880	What did they, there was this Canadian soap opera and Ryan Reynolds, I think was on it.
7883880	7887160	That's how, I think they called it 15 here.
7887800	7888600	Oh yeah.
7889480	7894520	But it was just, again, all those Nickelodeon shows were like repackaged Canadian shows.
7895320	7899480	Like, but then they like stuff like, like you can't do that on television.
7899480	7902280	Those people were more popular here than they were in Canada.
7903160	7905000	This is funny how that stuff works out.
7905000	7908600	So anyway, all right.
7909400	7911960	Zen monkey 11 and chat says, yeah, it was called 15.
7911960	7913400	I hated that show.
7913400	7916520	What did they call then MTV?
7916520	7920760	It wasn't a Canadian show at this point, but MTV did a dramatic soap, undressed.
7920760	7923160	That was, did you have all ever watched undressed?
7923880	7925880	That show is scandalous.
7925880	7927080	That show is scandalous.
7927720	7928040	Yeah.
7928040	7928440	Anyway.
7929320	7929720	All right.
7930360	7931000	Moving on.
7931000	7932520	Let's get to the listener round table.
7934680	7935880	Do we have any emails this week?
7935880	7939000	Participate at orangesontrader.com is the place to send emails.
7939560	7940840	Nary a one.
7940840	7941240	All right.
7941800	7942120	Ooh.
7942120	7946360	That does mean we get to divulge into drag race content, but I don't, I there's, I'm
7946360	7947720	not watching anything now.
7947720	7950440	They revealed everybody on celebrity drag race.
7951160	7951800	Oh, did they?
7952360	7952860	Yeah.
7953560	7957000	And it's everyone I thought thought it was going to be.
7957000	7960520	Well, the, the guy from mean girls was so obvious.
7960520	7961800	Like that had to be him.
7961800	7962200	Right.
7962200	7964120	Like you could tell that was him.
7964120	7965240	Mark and Delicato.
7965960	7969000	Um, ugly Betty.
7970280	7974840	There was, oh, he was like a little kid then, but that was like 10 years ago.
7974840	7975960	He's probably in his twenties now.
7976520	7977080	Yeah.
7977080	7977480	Yeah.
7977480	7980120	There were, um, Oh God.
7980680	7986040	Um, Oh, uh, Tatiana, uh, Ali.
7987560	7988760	Oh, okay.
7988760	7990120	As in Ashley banks.
7990120	7990360	Yeah.
7990360	7990680	Yeah.
7992440	7999640	Um, some, some comments from chat because now everybody's talking about the, the reminiscing
7999640	8003560	see a Tiberian chat says undressed on before love line.
8003560	8005880	Have I had to have told this on OLR at some point, right?
8005880	8009240	I was, I was on love line, not the TV show, but the radio shows.
8009240	8011720	Y'all know it was a radio show way before then.
8011720	8013720	And it was, I was on it once.
8013720	8017240	And, but I called because I wanted to talk to the celebrity guests.
8017240	8018040	I did not know.
8018040	8020920	It's not one of those things where, Ooh, tell us what your question was, Rob.
8020920	8023240	No, cause it wasn't, it wasn't anything juicy like that.
8023240	8031480	I wanted to talk to, um, Kennedy, the MTV VJ was on the show and I called in to ask
8031480	8035880	her a question because that was in my era of that's the type of work I want to do.
8035880	8037400	Look how far I made it.
8037400	8042120	Um, and, uh, uh, I wanted to, I don't remember exactly what the question was.
8042120	8044600	Something about like her success and all that stuff.
8044600	8047240	Um, and uh, yeah, I got to talk to her.
8047240	8049240	So that was, that was fun.
8049240	8049740	Yeah.
8050600	8051100	So, yeah.
8051720	8052840	Uh, we, we love it.
8053560	8054060	Yeah.
8055160	8058840	Uh, as Joan Hunter Matt reminds us Elvira's birthday was yesterday.
8059400	8059720	Yeah.
8059720	8061640	She's, uh, 71 now I think.
8061640	8062140	Right?
8062760	8064600	Oh, Cassandra's going strong.
8064600	8065100	Yep.
8065100	8065600	Yep.
8065840	8071040	The, the, uh, uh, I'm sorry, but the, the first big drag queen on television before
8071040	8073200	RuPaul was Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.
8074640	8081600	Do not forget the, the, the, probably the best and biggest drag queen of all time is
8081600	8083360	Cassandra Peterson, Elvira.
8083360	8083860	Indeed.
8084640	8085140	All right.
8085680	8087760	You know, when, when even Ru says it.
8087760	8090160	Yeah, Elvira is a drag queen, period.
8090160	8095040	Like that's just, it's just that, that wasn't the word for it yet, but Elvira is absolutely
8095040	8095600	a drag queen.
8096400	8096900	All right.
8097600	8099040	Um, let's see what else?
8099040	8100560	Oh, we have somebody in the green room.
8100560	8102560	Why don't we get to some calls?
8102560	8106560	So if you want to join the green room, just go to vognetwork.com slash discord.
8106560	8110160	And you too can be on Orange Launch Radio, just like this caller here.
8110160	8111360	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8111360	8111860	Who's this?
8112720	8114160	It is the one and only Ron.
8114160	8115440	How is everybody doing tonight?
8115440	8117280	Hey, I am fantastic, Ron.
8117280	8118160	How about yourself?
8118160	8122240	Except I lost a Loki somehow, but I'll, I'll find him here while you talk to us here.
8122960	8123920	Use the Konami code.
8123920	8124480	He'll come back.
8124720	8126160	Apparently or something.
8126160	8128720	So I don't know what I'm hiding behind dark sacros.
8128720	8129040	Fine.
8129040	8129920	I probably know.
8129920	8131200	I just moved the scene around.
8131200	8134160	I'll fix it live on air as I always do, but let's talk.
8134800	8136560	I've done the same thing when we go live.
8136560	8138160	I'm like, Oh, I forgot to change the episode.
8138160	8140000	The title episode changed that real quick.
8140880	8141600	Yeah, I don't.
8141600	8144480	I literally like deleted Loki somehow.
8144480	8144720	All right.
8144720	8145280	That's all right.
8145280	8148880	So we'll just, we'll duplicate one of the other ones and get them back.
8148880	8151440	Well, what's on your mind while I fix it live here?
8151440	8152240	Rama, how are you?
8152880	8153600	I'm good.
8153760	8154400	I'm tired.
8154400	8155680	I just unpacked from a trip.
8155680	8158160	Now I've got to pack for a trip for this weekend.
8158160	8159120	So, you know, but.
8160160	8161280	Enough about that.
8161280	8162080	A couple of things.
8162080	8165920	I'll be on my merry little way that I can just enjoy the rest of the show dinner and
8165920	8166880	watch anime.
8166880	8168800	Now I just find it funny.
8169840	8178960	Well, yeah, I try to make something interesting as best I possibly can, but this whole Ubisoft
8178960	8180320	thing, $10 more.
8180320	8186240	I'm just saying if you want to save the $10, just get the Xbox version because remember
8186240	8189360	the Xbox version is the same green case.
8189360	8193680	And when you buy and you pull it out, it says Xbox one Xbox series on it.
8193680	8194880	So there you go.
8196640	8197360	No good point.
8197360	8200080	And I still say my advice from before also stands.
8200080	8203760	Just wait for them to give it away because they all inevitably get given away or put
8203760	8208320	on those like game pass, uh, PlayStation plus like those types of things because there's
8208320	8210080	money to be made still there.
8210080	8212000	You know, that is true.
8212000	8216880	I mean, I picked up cryptid and necro dancer for switch for like four bucks, like over
8216880	8217520	the weekend.
8217520	8223840	So if you're willing, yeah, if you're willing to wait two years to play a game and I get
8223840	8223920	it.
8223920	8227920	Sometimes we're not, sometimes we're not like final fantasy 16.
8227920	8228800	No, bitch.
8228800	8230960	Day one, day fucking one.
8231520	8232400	I totally get that.
8232400	8235520	There are some games I will day one purchase the others.
8235520	8240240	I'll just put in my honey list and I'll just wait till it tells me, Oh, it's on sale for
8240240	8241520	such and such price.
8241520	8243840	And which I did during the pandemic.
8243840	8251200	And I realized I have probably over $500 worth of physical games I purchased during the pandemic
8251200	8252560	that is still sealed.
8252560	8254400	That should be the pandemic.
8254400	8254640	Yep.
8254640	8255440	The pandemic.
8255440	8256240	The pandemic.
8256800	8257360	I like that.
8257360	8259520	I'm going to use that for now on the pandemic.
8259520	8262240	My friends, Patty and Steph coined at the pandemic.
8263040	8263600	Same Patty.
8263600	8264640	I know from a jazz.
8265200	8266080	No, a different Patty.
8266080	8267040	She's okay.
8267040	8267200	Yeah.
8267200	8269120	I have to introduce y'all one day.
8269120	8270000	You will love her.
8270000	8271760	I, you know what?
8271760	8277040	Miss, Miss Melody and I have been talking and we did text Victoria as well about a return
8277040	8278800	to New York type of trip.
8278800	8283520	But what we realized, Rama, the only thing that we kind of are interested in seeing on
8283520	8286880	Broadway right now is Funny Girl with Lea Michele.
8286880	8291520	And it's, it's literally one of those, like, we're morbidly curious.
8291520	8293040	And that's the only way to describe it.
8293840	8296320	Like, we have to be in the room.
8297440	8300000	We have to be in the room for a second.
8300000	8301600	I thought she was going to say Phantom of the Opera.
8301600	8303120	I was gonna go, not you too.
8303120	8305040	No, that news hadn't come out yet.
8305680	8311120	I feel like Phantom of the Opera plays in like every fucking town in America at some
8311120	8311360	point.
8311360	8314320	And it's the same damn thing from a same thing with the Lion King.
8314320	8316080	How's the Lion King still on Broadway?
8316080	8319120	That show comes to every town in America.
8319120	8325200	You can go to Walla Walla, Washington and see a performance of the Lion King, just like
8325200	8326080	it is on Broadway.
8326080	8328080	Maybe not the same stars, but you know what?
8328080	8329360	It's acted just fine.
8330480	8332160	I want to take you all to see Beetlejuice.
8332160	8333520	That was amazing.
8333520	8334480	Oh, that would have been fun.
8335360	8336320	No, it's still playing.
8336320	8336880	Oh, is it?
8337680	8338640	It came back.
8338640	8339760	It came back.
8339760	8340400	Oh, nice.
8340400	8340720	Nice.
8341520	8343440	Pod Culture says don't knock on Phantom.
8343440	8344000	I'm not.
8344000	8347600	I'm just saying it's the same fucking show that tours America all the time.
8347600	8348800	And it's just as good.
8348880	8352080	You're not going to see Sarah Brightman in that show ever again.
8352080	8353600	So you know what?
8353600	8356720	Let the other actresses have their moment.
8356720	8358720	I don't like Sarah Brightman, so I don't care.
8358720	8358960	Oh, no.
8358960	8359760	What did she do?
8359760	8360160	Did she?
8360880	8362800	No, it's just her voice is too brassy.
8362800	8363920	Oh, I love her.
8363920	8366560	I do not like her voice in Phantom.
8367120	8368000	Legit.
8368000	8368800	Disagree on that.
8368800	8373360	Well, honestly, honestly, it was Repo, the genetic opera that sold me on her.
8373360	8375360	I love her in that movie.
8375360	8376720	That's the only thing she's been in that I like her in.
8376720	8380000	Okay, on that we agree that she's good in that.
8380800	8381920	I still like her in other stuff.
8383040	8386400	Anyway, look, here's the thing.
8386400	8386960	Here's the thing.
8386960	8389760	I'm going to just say this very plainly and very openly.
8390720	8396400	Sometimes there is music that you want to listen to when you just feel like a gigantic
8397520	8398560	homosexual slur.
8398560	8400400	Okay, I'm not going to say it, but you know the word.
8400400	8404320	When you're just in that mood where I feel like a gigantic tonight.
8404800	8408080	Sarah Brightman is one of those CDs that you will put on.
8408080	8414160	You will put on and it's just like, I'm just, I am feeling my gay oats tonight.
8414160	8420080	Listening to some Sarah Brightman deliver me out of the sadness.
8420080	8421360	It's that 100%.
8422560	8424000	Rob, are you having a moment right now?
8424000	8426160	Because I can always I might be.
8426160	8428400	I might be putting on some Sarah Brightman after the show tonight.
8428400	8428880	I might.
8430000	8430400	You know what?
8430640	8430960	You know what?
8430960	8436080	Before I get to the second topic, I just love how when I call in, we don't derail.
8436080	8441680	We just jump the fucking rail, end up on a track like halfway across town.
8443840	8450000	When you call in, the train's driver three mode is activated and anything can happen, Rama.
8452880	8455840	Now, the other thing we're talking about is G4.
8456400	8462560	And as I said in the chat, the fact that anything G4 related is not on Peacock.
8462560	8464800	That's the first thing you should know.
8464800	8471120	There was no faith in this because any of the Comcast network is on Peacock.
8471120	8473760	That was my earliest prediction about that whole thing.
8473760	8476720	When they first announced G4, I was like, oh, they're putting it on Peacock.
8476720	8477280	That's the whole thing.
8477280	8479440	And it wasn't that you're right.
8479440	8481120	Why isn't it on Peacock?
8481120	8484560	No, no, but WWE is on Peacock, but G4 isn't.
8485280	8485920	Interesting.
8486640	8492080	I just, you know, because that again, we talk about cable going away and it's going to go
8492080	8492640	away.
8492640	8495600	It's going to be things like Peacock and, you know, all these other.
8495600	8497840	Unfortunately, it's the battle of the streaming networks.
8497840	8500960	But you are starting to see consolidation.
8500960	8505200	You know, you're starting to see that they're realizing, you know, for better and for worse.
8505200	8507360	So when I say for worse, I mean, discovery.
8507360	8509120	We all know we all know.
8509120	8509600	Let's not.
8510160	8510800	Oh, let's not.
8510800	8512880	Because I have a napalm with their name on it.
8512880	8513520	Oh, let's not.
8514320	8517120	Careful when you say things like that on a live Internet show.
8517120	8518400	He's speaking in a hyperbole.
8519760	8525040	Anyway, but the other thing now, now the train really did derail.
8525040	8526480	Oh, Showtime.
8526480	8527760	That was the big one.
8527760	8532640	So they're realizing people don't want to pay like, what is it, like 10 bucks a month
8532640	8534000	just for Showtime stuff?
8534000	8535360	Yeah, $10 extra.
8535360	8535520	Yeah.
8536720	8537760	And so they're going to merge.
8537760	8541680	They're going to merge Showtime into, I think, Paramount Plus at this point, which it's all
8542560	8546400	good because there's a bundle deal going on.
8546400	8548960	If you pay for it, you go into the app, you push up.
8548960	8552080	It brings up the Showtime stuff, Hulu and Prime.
8552080	8557440	I did buy Showtime at one point for one specific show.
8557440	8559760	And then I immediately canceled it when said show is over.
8559760	8560640	And that was Twin Peaks.
8560640	8563360	The return I did it for Dexter.
8563360	8565680	And I'm just severely disappointed how it ended.
8565680	8567760	So I'm like, I don't care if there's a season two.
8567760	8569040	I'm not resubbing for it.
8569040	8573520	Yeah, but I'll resub for a season four of Twin Peaks if it ever happens.
8573520	8577760	But I don't expect David Lynch to actually do it, but I hope fair.
8578400	8580720	Now, here's the thing about G4.
8581920	8587200	I have no desire because there's nothing on there that caters interest me.
8587200	8593040	I enjoy watching more tech YouTubers and tech Twitch streams and so forth.
8593040	8594800	That's more interesting to me.
8594800	8602480	What G4, I mean, we're at the point where gaming is console and PC.
8602480	8606560	I understand that G4 has some known streamers on there.
8606560	8609280	But honestly, it ain't doing a lick of good.
8609280	8613920	They're too busy fighting back against the woke, which I'm all for.
8613920	8617840	Because there are people out there who are running their mouth that need not to.
8617840	8622480	OK, but what G4 needs to do is cater everybody.
8622480	8627280	Have a show about technology, about building and repairs.
8627280	8632480	I've always said for the longest I wanted a Geek Squad-esque reality show on there where
8632480	8636720	it shows them working on these computers and talking about how people can't do certain
8636720	8637040	stuff.
8637040	8644320	Yeah, that's my cup of tea.
8644320	8647040	You know, I'm just getting my depth and chat says, wait, wait, wait.
8647040	8648080	Fight against the woke.
8648080	8650880	Can you know what I mean against them?
8650880	8651920	But, you know.
8651920	8652880	Oh, OK.
8652880	8657040	So like earlier what you were saying earlier that I got it, got it, got it, got it.
8658800	8659920	That's what I meant.
8659920	8662720	You know, it sounded backwards the way it came out with.
8662720	8663440	I get I get you now.
8663440	8663920	I get you now.
8664480	8667680	Yeah, normally I kind of have like a little notepad here of everything.
8667680	8668320	I want to find.
8668960	8669680	I'm glad I asked.
8670720	8674800	Fifth Dream says, yeah, G4 is OK, but it's nothing I can't get from any other random
8674800	8675520	Twitch streamer.
8676240	8680080	Tiger class says G4 TV needs somebody like a Linus with all the tech stuff.
8680880	8683520	It it needs a sort of must see TV.
8683520	8687840	And I feel like right now it's kind of living in a nostalgia realm with things like X play
8687840	8688720	and so forth, which is fine.
8688720	8690240	And clearly there's an audience for that.
8690240	8692400	We have people in our chat that are still watching.
8692400	8692880	And that's good.
8692880	8695040	Again, I'm not I'm not here to yuck your yum.
8695040	8696080	You know, that's great.
8696080	8702560	I'm just saying the landscape is a lot different now than it was in 2006 when that was the
8702560	8708000	only way to see tech content in the media was either tech TV or, you know, when the merger
8708000	8711760	first happened or early G4, whatever, whatever side of the fence you're on.
8711760	8713920	That was the only way to see it back in the day.
8713920	8715440	That's just not the case anymore.
8715440	8718320	It has to compete with literally everything else.
8718320	8720000	So it needs more moments.
8720000	8728320	And I'm just I'm not sure I'm not sure how resting on the successes of the past are going
8728320	8730080	to make it new fans.
8730720	8733360	I see how it enthuses the old fans.
8733360	8735840	I don't see how it adds new fans.
8735840	8739600	But I you know, again, I'm not trying to run a TV network.
8739600	8741680	It's a lot more complicated than I think.
8741680	8747440	So, you know, you know what I've done G4 good if they actually did live streams of Evo or
8747440	8749120	highlights of that, if they had something like that.
8749120	8754000	Actually, I don't know if you remember a couple of years back coverage what they used to do.
8754000	8755200	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8755200	8756720	I believe it was a couple of years back.
8756720	8760080	Disney was showing a gaming tournament on their channel.
8760080	8761280	I was like, wait, what?
8761280	8761680	Yeah.
8761680	8761920	You know?
8763280	8764960	No, that I think you make a good point.
8764960	8770080	And to be fair and out of interest, the pandemic and all that is probably lowered the opportunities
8770080	8771920	for G4 to really push into that space.
8771920	8776560	But I think you bring up an excellent point is that, you know, people always will flock
8776560	8780880	back to TV and live TV and local TV and that stuff for live events.
8780880	8784240	And I think the more of that the G4 can kind of bring in, I think I think you're right
8784240	8785600	that that would be very interesting.
8786240	8792480	So Zen Monkey is pointing out one of the ex hosts did a I'm sorry ex host did a full live
8792480	8793840	stream of a cosplay event.
8793840	8797600	So they probably just, you know, need to lean into that a little more.
8798160	8803840	Yeah, because gaming is, it's basically all encompassing gaming, tech, cosplay, anime,
8803840	8804320	all of that.
8804320	8810480	I mean, you could you could have shows about not just gaming, but have some shows about
8810480	8815120	tech, what's going on, have some shows, like, maybe throw some anime on there stream that
8815120	8820320	because remember, tech TV was showing late night anime and that did help, you know, it's
8820320	8825200	a little bit of everything that could work, you know, because, because let's be real,
8825200	8830400	I don't want to turn on G4 and watch another episode of Star Trek Next Generation.
8830400	8832000	Not to have nothing against it.
8832000	8836640	But to me personally, it ain't the show to what I expect to find on it.
8836640	8841360	Now, if they took the video game Star Trek The Next Generation, I was doing parody episodes
8841360	8842720	with it with the graphics.
8843840	8847840	Yeah, wasn't that literally there was a show like that on the old old G4.
8847840	8848960	It was MMOs.
8848960	8850800	They did lines.
8850800	8851920	They dubbed over MMOs.
8853120	8857280	That was like one of the earliest shows on the original G4 before tech TV portal.
8857280	8858080	This is what that was.
8858080	8859920	It was called Portal before there was a game called that.
8860800	8863280	Bring back code monkeys, you know, come on now.
8863280	8866640	There is so much stuff going on in the gaming industry.
8866640	8868080	They could easily parody.
8868080	8870720	That's like five seasons of content right there.
8872160	8872720	All right.
8872720	8875120	Well, my friend, do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
8875120	8877120	Oh, no, that's it.
8877120	8879680	Besides the fact I like Jamie's new hairstyle.
8879680	8881600	It's kind of banging rocket.
8881600	8884640	I actually was trying to fix the shave myself.
8885760	8886480	So hold on.
8886480	8888160	Let me show you what I ended up doing.
8888160	8893280	I'm going to actually be going to sport clips like, you know, the place where the dudes
8893280	8894000	get their hair done.
8895120	8898800	This is what I did as far as I can do by myself.
8899600	8901760	I think you did a really good job.
8901760	8904000	It's a lot better than what I did during the pandemic.
8904480	8906320	Screw this and just shave my head bald.
8906320	8907840	OK, I came close to that, though.
8909120	8913120	But I am after Twitch Con.
8913760	8916400	I am going to let it grow out.
8916400	8919680	But when they get the fuzzy underside, it's going to be purple.
8920720	8923920	Oh, I like I am going to have magneto hair.
8923920	8927680	I'm going to shave freshly bald for Twitch Con.
8927680	8930160	So. All right.
8931200	8933040	Wait, Rob, I have to ask you,
8933680	8935840	do you do it yourself or do you have someone do it?
8935840	8936480	Alan, does it?
8937600	8939360	That way, I don't miss any spots or anything like that.
8940000	8941840	I'm having I'm having Dan touch mine up.
8942640	8943200	Nice.
8943200	8946160	That is the purpose of a spouse to shave your head.
8948080	8948400	All right.
8949760	8952640	All right, my friend, Rama, anything else on your mind before we let you go?
8953840	8957600	Give Alan some love for us, because we know he's he's dealing, you know.
8957600	8961520	He's actually I think I said this at the very beginning, you weren't here yet, but him
8961520	8966480	and I tested negative on the same day, except it was day 11 for me and I think day seven for him.
8966480	8968320	But he had Paxlevid.
8971040	8976960	He didn't get prescribed Paxlevid, but in a genius move by someone's health care company,
8976960	8981520	they got Paxlevid showing up on their doorstep on day six after it was too late to take it.
8981520	8985360	So it was too late for me, but it wasn't too late for him.
8985360	8987120	So you know what I said?
8987120	8987760	Just take it.
8987760	8988240	And he did.
8988240	8991280	And he got over it like, what, four days faster as a result.
8992000	8993040	Hey, pay it forward.
8993600	8994080	Exactly.
8994080	8995760	And I'm a firework for cosplay.
8995760	9000480	I guess I guess I am admitting to some type of, you know, probably federal issue here.
9000480	9002320	Look, he's my fucking husband.
9002320	9006560	And you would do it too for your spouse if you were in the same situation.
9006560	9011840	So don't fucking come to me with, you know, the rules and regulations.
9011840	9012400	Exactly.
9012400	9013280	Just does it on his own.
9013280	9014320	Anyone would.
9014320	9015600	So all right.
9016160	9021760	Um, and if you want to blame anybody, blame my health care provider for being so freaking
9021760	9025680	messy, they didn't get me the meds until it was already day six and didn't even notice
9025680	9026800	that it was day six.
9026800	9029040	So you never got prescribed it at all.
9031520	9032560	That's a whole other issue.
9032560	9033360	So anyway.
9033360	9035280	All right, that's going to do it.
9035280	9037040	Rama, thank you so much for calling in.
9037040	9038560	Have a fantastic rest of your night.
9038560	9039360	Okay.
9039360	9039680	I will.
9039680	9041840	You take care and y'all stay fabulous and awesome.
9041840	9042240	All right.
9042240	9042640	I will.
9042640	9044160	It's all it's all I know how to do.
9044720	9044960	All right.
9044960	9045520	Bye, my friend.
9046160	9046800	Bye.
9046800	9047600	All right.
9047600	9051600	Uh, let's see the whole reason I never got prescribed, by the way, is because I had a
9051600	9056080	negative, uh, uh, test, uh, test there.
9056080	9057840	And then I had a positive antigen test.
9059120	9061120	That is so interesting.
9061120	9064400	No, I was just like, I sent you the picture of my results too.
9064400	9064720	I know.
9064720	9066240	I was just like, Hey, I have diabetes.
9066240	9067120	Can I get Paxilid?
9067120	9071280	And then like three days later it was like, Oh no, I got the boilerplate answer first.
9071280	9073040	And then three days later, Oh, I'm sorry.
9073120	9075440	I was out of the office and I'm just now seeing this.
9075440	9077280	I'll make sure you get it ASAP.
9077280	9080800	And sure enough, it gets delivered up on my door the next day on day six when it's, you're
9080800	9083040	not, and if you don't know, you're not supposed to take it after day five.
9083040	9084720	It's ineffective after day five.
9084720	9088240	So I'm pretty sure that that's why I never got prescribed it.
9088240	9093440	Cause I didn't get my days off and you know, I should have probably had it right at the
9093440	9096560	beginning given my other condition, but it is what it is.
9096560	9097040	I'm with us.
9097040	9097680	J one hundred mad.
9097680	9098240	It's ridiculous.
9098240	9100320	You can't just walk into a store and buy it at this point.
9100320	9108480	I mean, but I understand though that there are people who don't have it, but I think
9109360	9112720	and it needs to really be saved for the people who legitimately need it.
9112720	9113920	It's fair, fair.
9113920	9114320	All right.
9114320	9119200	I want to go to tweets over twitter.com slash O L R and dark Tetsuya reminding me of this
9119200	9120160	other one.
9120160	9123360	This other announcement for Tokyo game show and it was specifically Konami.
9123360	9127440	And you know, dark Tetsuya had something to say about the creators of La Mulana and what
9127440	9128240	they're doing next.
9128240	9130240	But I actually think this is pretty cool.
9130240	9137760	So do you remember how Konami was running a competition for revitalizing one of their
9137760	9139920	old franchises?
9139920	9144080	If you were an indie developer and you had a good idea, they were going to help you basically
9144080	9144960	revitalize.
9144960	9151760	So long story short, the guy behind La Mulana pitched a maze of galleous remake, which
9151760	9154800	ironically was the game that inspired La Mulana and he won.
9155600	9160160	So yeah, so that's the La Mulana.
9160160	9162080	That's so interesting how that came full circle.
9162080	9166800	So it's the game that inspired La Mulana is now going to get a remake or redo by the La
9166800	9167440	Mulana group.
9168080	9168960	What's that?
9168960	9170000	You know, he was tickled.
9170000	9173040	Oh, well, he was and dark Tetsuya was, that's for sure.
9173040	9173360	Yes.
9173360	9174240	Oh yeah, for sure.
9174240	9175040	That's huge news.
9175040	9175920	That's great.
9175920	9177200	So all right.
9177840	9181040	If you want to send us some tweets, twitter.com slash O L R.
9181040	9184400	But with that, that's the tweets, that's the emails, that's the calls.
9184960	9186320	So that's the show.
9186320	9188160	We had a full show, fun show tonight.
9188160	9190160	Thank you all for listening and tuning in tonight.
9190160	9191040	Really appreciate it.
9192720	9195760	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Tons Radio, please tell a friend or two about
9195760	9196320	the show.
9196320	9199280	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we
9199280	9201040	need more voices in the room.
9201040	9205360	A nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you heard this show.
9205360	9207920	Those nice five star reviews go an awful long way.
9207920	9209680	So thank you so much for those.
9209680	9211920	Be sure to follow us over at VOG Network.
9211920	9213920	That's V O G Network on Twitch as well.
9213920	9215440	That is also appreciated.
9216720	9217840	That is it for now.
9217840	9219920	We'll be back next week to do it all again.
9219920	9223920	But just heads up, we will be off in early October.
9223920	9229360	We are not going to be here the night of October 9th, I think it is.
9229360	9230800	You are correct.
9230800	9231920	That is TwitchCon.
9231920	9234800	And you've heard Dark Soccer and I both talking about how we will both be there.
9235520	9242160	So, well, actually I may be back just in time, but I'm not going to push it.
9242160	9247360	So Loki will be here and maybe he'll maybe he'll stream some of his big build or something.
9247360	9248080	I don't know.
9248080	9250400	But there will be no official we've done by then.
9251360	9251860	Yeah.
9252720	9253220	So.
9253680	9254180	All right.
9256400	9257760	That is going to do it.
9259040	9261440	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9261440	9262880	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
9263600	9267760	I'm getting sick of all these motherfucking Weskers in this motherfucking game.
9267760	9268560	Right?
9268560	9269060	God.
9270480	9271600	They need to nerve him.
9271600	9272480	Oh, no.
9272480	9275760	On Friday when we were playing, we just all DC'd at the same time.
9275760	9277040	And you know, I don't DC.
9277040	9277600	Yeah, I know.
9279360	9282080	His passive does not need to be as strong as it is.
9282080	9286080	I don't know what they were thinking giving him that in addition to his already existing ability.
9286880	9289040	His passive needs a huge nerf to it.
9289920	9293520	Survivors do not need to gain the passive stuff as fast as they do.
9295280	9297920	And they shouldn't have nerfed a self-care.
9297920	9301280	Their locations don't need to be given away when they use an antidote either.
9301680	9305040	So they need to nerf that, I think.
9305040	9306560	And Wesker will be fine.
9307520	9309840	Anyway, have a good stream, Dark Soccer.
9309840	9310960	We'll see you next week.
9311680	9312240	Thank you.
9312240	9314560	I will see you all in whenever.
9314560	9316160	Bye, everybody.
9316160	9316560	Bye-bye.
9316560	9318240	Let's go to Loki and your final thought tonight.
9318800	9322160	I didn't really have too much other than I did want to mention I just saw there was
9322880	9326000	another game announcement for Rise of the Triad Ludicrous Edition.
9327120	9331120	It's a remaster of the original Rise of the Triad.
9332160	9335920	Now in 4K, although, I mean, it doesn't really need to be in 4K because, you know,
9335920	9337360	it was an old DOS game.
9337360	9340720	But new map editors coming to all consoles and stuff.
9340720	9342960	And they have a new episode in there as well.
9342960	9343280	Nice.
9344000	9344240	Yeah.
9346240	9348960	My final thought tonight is speaking of streaming.
9348960	9351360	I am finally coming back to streaming tomorrow night.
9352080	9356080	Usually after post-DragonCon, I'm really high on the streaming train.
9356080	9359120	I'm like, I'm super motivated to do stuff and create content.
9359120	9360800	And then COVID said, ha.
9361360	9364000	So I've been out of it for a couple of weeks.
9364000	9364960	I'm way overdue.
9364960	9369200	I'm literally two weeks later and I wanted to be on this, but I will finally be streaming
9369200	9371280	again tomorrow night after work.
9371280	9372880	So please look forward to that.
9372880	9374960	I will be doing some Final Fantasy 14 tomorrow.
9375760	9378240	I'm actually thinking I'm going to have a schedule this week.
9378240	9383920	And so as of right now, I'm going to do Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and I will be doing Final
9383920	9385680	Fantasy 14 tomorrow.
9385680	9387920	I think dead by daylight on Friday.
9387920	9391440	And it's up in the air on what I'm going to do Wednesday, but something outside my normal
9391440	9391760	realm.
9391760	9394000	I might actually do Assassin's Creed Odyssey on Wednesday.
9394000	9399040	So check that out over at my Twitch over at Rob Roberts.
9399760	9402400	Tiger Claw says I'm still positive and haven't been able to go back to work.
9402400	9403040	I'm sorry to hear that.
9403040	9403920	Feel better.
9403920	9406400	I hope it took me 11 days to test negative.
9406400	9409360	I've heard it takes some people a little longer.
9409360	9411600	So just crossing my fingers for you, Tiger Claw.
9411600	9412400	I know it's no fun.
9413440	9414720	Be safe out there, everyone.
9416000	9416560	That's it.
9416560	9417360	Happy gaming.
9417360	9418480	Have a great week, everyone.
9418480	9421280	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9421280	9421840	Good night.
9445680	9450640	Those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor VOG Network, but you know they were all
9450640	9451520	still true.
9475680	9479840	Bye.
