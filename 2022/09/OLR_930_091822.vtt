00:00.000 --> 00:14.360
You know the Sims? And the current game in that series has just under $1000 of DLC? Now

00:14.360 --> 00:18.980
you can get the base Sims 4 for free! Thanks EA! You finally understood where the money

00:18.980 --> 00:22.400
is made and gave people the same thing that shareware of decades past did in order to

00:22.400 --> 00:28.740
entice consumers and provide value. Generosity! Wow! This is one story that should have come

00:28.740 --> 00:32.620
out years ago. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell

00:32.620 --> 00:35.640
you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show

00:35.640 --> 00:37.660
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.660 --> 00:46.220
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:46.220 --> 00:53.420
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

00:53.420 --> 01:01.020
number 930 of our show for tonight September the 18th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and

01:01.020 --> 01:08.780
I am joined with my co-hosts. Say hello and welcome back to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:08.780 --> 01:11.220
Your hi didn't come through. You might be muted but how are you?

01:11.220 --> 01:12.220
I'm not muted.

01:12.220 --> 01:14.940
Now it came through. That was weird. Well, how are you?

01:14.940 --> 01:16.940
My voice is still kind of messed up.

01:16.940 --> 01:19.220
Well, I hope you are feeling better overall though.

01:20.020 --> 01:27.940
I am for the most part. I'm on prednisone for my cough. One more week off of work. I

01:27.940 --> 01:39.940
mean, it's, I'm getting bored. But I've got other stuff to be doing. But yeah, it's, it's,

01:39.940 --> 01:45.460
yeah I just want the cough to go away and so far on my second day I've been pretty okay.

01:45.460 --> 01:49.020
Just my voice is still trying to go out a little bit.

01:50.020 --> 01:54.580
I mean, not your voice going out, but the cough is getting better. I talked a little bit on last

01:54.580 --> 02:00.260
week's show about my own COVID troubles and luckily the cough for the most part has subsided. I still

02:00.260 --> 02:05.060
hear Alan with it a little bit. But the interesting thing is we tested negative on the same day,

02:05.060 --> 02:09.860
even though he didn't come down with COVID for about four or five days after me, but

02:09.860 --> 02:14.100
he had Paxlevid. I didn't this time. So I think that helped.

02:14.100 --> 02:26.460
So I, you know, in my case, I, we're not sure if my other issues extended it, or if it's considered,

02:26.460 --> 02:33.500
you know, long COVID or not. So yeah, but I'm feeling better, which is good because, you know,

02:33.500 --> 02:39.980
I've got TwitchCon coming up. Yeah, right. I'm like, well, at least I've gone through all that

02:40.020 --> 02:44.740
before TwitchCon. I mean, I'd still like to get the shot, but I just, I have to talk to my doctor

02:44.740 --> 02:49.140
about the timeframe. Of course I'm going to TwitchCon. Okay. I thought for some reason you

02:49.140 --> 02:53.860
weren't and I, well, then I should have gotten a bigger hotel room for Disneyland on Monday.

02:53.860 --> 03:00.020
Oh, well, we're flying. So we're flying back on Monday. So, because we, now, now we've missed

03:00.020 --> 03:04.500
more work than either of us wanted to. So we don't want to extend the trip and we have, we're going

03:04.540 --> 03:11.740
to Seattle in November. So there's, there's that we have as well. So yeah, I, my, my work takes

03:11.740 --> 03:18.300
care of us for stuff like that. However long it takes to get better. That's good. So I can give

03:18.300 --> 03:26.140
you more about that, but I've got a nice Airbnb with some of the other Twitch folks. Yeah, like

03:26.860 --> 03:34.460
staying with Intoxicated and Fluffy and Deez Nuts. I'm sorry, you're friends with Deez Nuts?

03:34.500 --> 03:39.380
Is that what you're saying here? Yes. All right. Is Deez Nuts your bestie?

03:41.380 --> 03:46.420
We, we know each other. You, you, you're, you're pretty fond of Deez Nuts is what you're saying.

03:49.620 --> 03:56.580
Look, you set it up. I took the shot. All right. Well, and also Cup of Jojo. I don't know if you've

03:56.580 --> 04:02.660
ever. Yeah, I do recognize some of these names. I do. Yeah. All right. It's going to be a big

04:02.660 --> 04:08.820
reunion there. Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki. Hello. You had me worried there

04:08.820 --> 04:12.260
for a minute. I thought behind you, that was the footage we were going to talk about at the top of

04:12.260 --> 04:16.500
the show tonight, but no, I recognize the characters. That's actually Grand Theft Auto 5.

04:16.500 --> 04:27.220
I would never do that. Leak footage on the air. Who would do that? Me? No, but take two,

04:27.220 --> 04:32.100
you know, is going to go hog wild with those takedowns. So obviously we will not be doing

04:32.100 --> 04:36.100
any of that here tonight because we like our show to be able to be viewed in the archive.

04:36.740 --> 04:41.140
But there's nothing wrong with showing Grand Theft Auto 5, a fine, a fine game,

04:41.140 --> 04:47.540
in the Grand Theft Auto series. A game of all time. It is a game. Yes. Well, shoot, I guess I

04:47.540 --> 04:50.980
kind of gave away what we're going to talk about at the top of the show here. We do talk about

04:50.980 --> 04:54.740
video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. We do it live every Sunday night,

04:54.740 --> 04:59.380
nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash

04:59.380 --> 05:05.380
vog network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And, uh, you know, contrary to last week,

05:05.380 --> 05:10.340
last week was a little bit slower in the news department. This week we had Tokyo game show.

05:10.340 --> 05:15.300
So we've got a Nintendo direct to talk about. We've got a PlayStation direct to talk about.

05:15.300 --> 05:19.380
We've got, um, other news that came out of Tokyo game show to talk about. Like there's,

05:19.380 --> 05:25.620
there's no shortage of news this week. And then this morning, huge bombshell in the industry

05:25.700 --> 05:31.380
drops. Um, yeah, Loki, you're, you're the fan here on this program of this series.

05:31.380 --> 05:44.180
Tell us what went down. So, um, a user by the name of, uh, teapot Uber hacker, um, posted a link to,

05:44.980 --> 05:51.060
um, it was a telegram download for 90 videos that they quote unquote,

05:51.620 --> 05:59.060
goal from rock stars, um, from an employee Slack account. Um, this is also apparently the same

05:59.060 --> 06:05.780
individual who hacked, um, Uber recently as well. And so on top of this, they say they,

06:05.780 --> 06:12.660
they had 90 plus video clips from the game in development, uh, debug code or with the

06:12.660 --> 06:19.060
debug code and stuff. They also said they had, I think the source for GTA five and I think for

06:19.060 --> 06:29.300
sex as well. Um, so I mean, I'm not just gonna not download that. So, uh, I watched all of the

06:29.300 --> 06:34.100
videos. Look, here's the thing. We're not going to play it here on the show, but you have social

06:34.100 --> 06:38.740
media, you have a Twitter account. It's very easy to search to look at this and like, like, look

06:38.740 --> 06:45.140
again, I think it's unfortunate this happened to rock star, but how am I going to not see it when

06:45.140 --> 06:50.340
this is huge gaming news going on today in the industry? Can I just say this though, for what

06:50.340 --> 06:54.900
it's worth? I mean, it sucks that rock star was robbed of a moment and the employees that have

06:54.900 --> 06:58.980
been working on the game have been robbed of this. I, and I know gamers are always going to have

06:58.980 --> 07:04.660
something to say and commentary, even though so many of them that do commentation on this industry

07:04.660 --> 07:09.620
have no idea what they're talking about and what goes into actually making a game. But can I say

07:09.780 --> 07:15.300
so like, Oh, how is this game using reused assets from grand theft auto five? Because that's what

07:15.300 --> 07:19.460
every game does early in development. I don't think it is using reused assets from somebody

07:19.460 --> 07:25.460
called that out on Twitter and was right through the coals out for it. But here's the thing is that

07:25.460 --> 07:30.820
I actually thought it looked really good. I was like the graphics in this game are incredible.

07:30.820 --> 07:37.700
This looks like this really looks next gen. So the rumor is the story supposed to take place

07:37.780 --> 07:45.060
around these two main characters, Jason Lucia. So we have a female main protagonist in the game as

07:45.060 --> 07:51.060
well. And it's supposed to be like a Bonnie and Clyde type story. So much like you can play three

07:51.060 --> 07:54.580
different characters in five, it looks like you can at least play through two characters right

07:54.580 --> 08:01.300
now. Like literally literally the opening scene in Pulp Fiction is what it is. Yeah, they had they

08:01.300 --> 08:08.260
had a good scene where they were robbing a a fast food place and it kind of showed off some of the

08:08.260 --> 08:15.460
stuff there most of the video because I watched all 90 of them. So most of the video they weren't

08:15.460 --> 08:22.340
very long. Most of the video was just animation tests. So it's like testing animation blending

08:22.340 --> 08:27.220
looks like they have a brand new animation system that's working with the game itself. So

08:27.780 --> 08:30.980
you know, for different character aiming and stuff, it's gonna be very,

08:32.740 --> 08:39.140
very dynamic the way it looks like it works like they have like different points of the body that

08:39.140 --> 08:44.020
are kind of, you know, facing different directions and blending together and all that kind of stuff.

08:44.020 --> 08:50.420
So there's a lot of tests regarding that. There was footage of like, it's basically just it's a

08:50.420 --> 08:56.020
lot of debug stuff. It's either they're taking, you know, video footage of like, here's a bug

08:57.140 --> 09:04.020
to here's some video footage of us testing this system and stuff. So it was kind of interesting

09:04.020 --> 09:10.420
to see all that kind of behind the scenes stuff. I mean, obviously a lot of this is not close to

09:10.420 --> 09:16.180
being finished, but it is pretty polished from what we've seen so far. There are a lot of

09:16.180 --> 09:20.820
placeholder things like you could see some buildings that don't have the date like they've

09:20.820 --> 09:26.020
I mean, it makes sense because you don't put those those checkerboard those checkerboard

09:26.020 --> 09:31.940
textures that you always see in test. Yeah, that that's a test levels that they put in there to

09:31.940 --> 09:38.500
test animations. They have a vehicle test level to test, you know, vehicle physics and whatnot.

09:38.500 --> 09:43.460
And they have like different materials and they're testing just all they have, you know, stuff for

09:43.460 --> 09:50.340
that. And then there's the main world that they're kind of testing stuff in as well. And I mean,

09:50.340 --> 09:54.740
it looks pretty polished, but they've still got, you know, obviously there's placeholder buildings

09:54.740 --> 10:00.820
and stuff in there where the details aren't necessarily there, which is fine. I mean, that

10:00.820 --> 10:06.660
and the character models, there's a lot of like temporary character models that they're just using

10:06.660 --> 10:10.900
it for, you know, kind of testing the mission scripting and all that stuff because all that

10:10.900 --> 10:14.820
stuff comes like last like all of the polish and stuff on there.

10:14.820 --> 10:19.140
And so some folks pointing out in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

10:19.140 --> 10:23.780
SSG100 Matt says it's two year old alpha footage, it's going to be totally different and probably

10:23.780 --> 10:28.660
already totally different. Not all of it is. Some of it is taken down and I want to see it.

10:28.660 --> 10:33.300
Just so just search for GTA six, but use the Roman numeral six leaks on Twitter

10:33.300 --> 10:38.260
and like go sort by recent. And you'll see videos as they come up.

10:39.060 --> 10:43.220
It's a lot of it because all the files were dated. So I don't know if they're all from the

10:43.220 --> 10:49.460
same builds, but based off of the build information that's in there, you can see which version of

10:49.460 --> 10:54.420
Windows is running on. So some of them are from earlier. We'll just from a little bit earlier

10:54.420 --> 11:00.820
this year. If the file names are to be believed, some of them are within like a few days ago.

11:01.300 --> 11:10.020
Oh, and upwards to I think 20 like 2019 or 2020 is how far back they go. But it you can obviously

11:10.020 --> 11:13.300
tell like from just some of the stuff that they're testing, like some of it's just like basic

11:13.860 --> 11:20.020
animation things. Some of it now is more, you know, does the animation look correctly for

11:20.020 --> 11:25.620
shooting out of a window? No, this is my character. You turn correctly, is it not look all

11:25.620 --> 11:31.940
janky and that type of stuff. So they they're doing more of the complex stuff now to get that

11:31.940 --> 11:37.380
going. But you can see their mission creation stuff. You know, a lot of it obviously is a huge

11:37.380 --> 11:43.460
peak behind the curtain for better or for worse, right? It's a huge peak. It's still probably a

11:43.460 --> 11:50.420
ways off. I think I think it's probably at least in the next year, not the year after by by this.

11:51.060 --> 11:56.340
But it looks really good. That's the pre alpha stuff looks better than Saints Row.

11:57.540 --> 12:02.100
I know. I think this might surprise you in some way that we're saying this. And again,

12:02.100 --> 12:07.620
I'm not advocating what happened. It sucks that this happened. The fact of the matter is once on

12:07.620 --> 12:10.740
the internet, always on the internet. So now that I've looked at the footage, I am like,

12:10.740 --> 12:16.180
actually, it looks really good. Like the graphics look incredible. And I don't usually super get

12:16.180 --> 12:20.740
into these games. But I've been trying I'll get into it in my gaming week. I've been trying a lot

12:20.740 --> 12:25.780
of new shoes on the feet this week, thanks to things like game pass. And I got to admit,

12:25.780 --> 12:32.980
I'm kind of interested in this. So for what it's worth, you won me over even though it was not

12:32.980 --> 12:38.420
intended this way. And I'm sure that the actual polished trailer will be even more hype. But it's

12:38.420 --> 12:43.620
interesting. Right. And the game, you know, for those who aren't familiar is going to take place

12:43.620 --> 12:50.820
in Vice City, as was rumored to be the case. And it looks good. I mean, it looks good so far. Like

12:50.820 --> 12:57.780
they certainly haven't shied away from all of like the lewd stuff like Saints Row did Saints Row was

12:57.780 --> 13:02.660
like, we can't put any of this inappropriate stuff in there. It's just ridiculous. But we're

13:02.660 --> 13:07.700
going to murder a ton of people. Whereas they're like, you know, there's a strip club scene in this

13:07.700 --> 13:14.340
footage already. Like so it's it's like, I'm glad Grand Theft Auto is just Grand Theft Auto,

13:14.340 --> 13:19.940
honestly, like they had some NPC dialogue, you know, this guy like spouting off all this like

13:19.940 --> 13:26.900
QAnon, like conspiracy theory nonsense, you know, you're talking about like social media companies

13:26.900 --> 13:31.060
trying to track your every movement and stuff like that. But it's all in game stuff. Obviously,

13:31.060 --> 13:34.980
you know, they're talking about life life hacker and stuff like that, which is I think their

13:34.980 --> 13:42.820
Facebook. It's just, I don't know, it's funny, it's it would be, I am very much looking forward

13:42.820 --> 13:48.740
to a new Grand Theft Auto. Yeah, the story campaign. I am not looking forward to a Grand

13:48.740 --> 13:56.900
Theft Auto online too, which will just be melt to death with microtransactions. But the stories are

13:56.900 --> 14:01.380
always very good. I want to come back to Grand Theft Auto online in a minute because people say

14:01.380 --> 14:05.780
this is actually the most damning part of the leak like whatever the Grand Theft Auto six part,

14:05.780 --> 14:09.620
they'll recover from this. I mean, it sucks that they got the wind knocked out of it a little bit

14:09.620 --> 14:14.260
with their big announcement everything but like, remember Half Life 2, like the entire source code

14:14.260 --> 14:19.300
for that game leaked before it came out and that game ended up doing just fine. And I think Grand

14:19.300 --> 14:23.460
Theft Auto six is going to be just fine. But let's talk about Grand Theft Auto online in a moment. I

14:23.460 --> 14:27.860
want to get some more comments from the chat over twitch.tv slash vog network. Quest Buster says the

14:27.860 --> 14:32.100
dev and debug panels were visible in the footage I saw like the holdup scene there was a lot of

14:32.100 --> 14:37.140
placeholder code pinging reactions, behaviors, etc, with a bunch of dummies filling in. There

14:37.140 --> 14:42.340
were also voice acting already implemented for the scene, which was surprising. It may be less

14:42.340 --> 14:48.100
surprising if they actually mocap to the actors performing it as was what they did in Red Dead

14:48.100 --> 14:52.420
Redemption, which you know, I kind of learned a lot more about thanks to Dragon Con and interviewing

14:52.420 --> 14:56.420
the folks behind it that actually may have been one of the first things they did. It could be that

14:56.420 --> 15:01.300
the main actors are actually motion captured like they were in Red Dead. I don't know. Loki is does

15:01.300 --> 15:06.260
that seem like probably yes, it will be the case because that's how they did five. So it's not

15:06.260 --> 15:10.980
they're going to do this until they did read it. And so that has to come first and then they add

15:10.980 --> 15:16.020
everything in around it basically. And that's why the placeholder, you know, people in the diner and

15:16.020 --> 15:20.340
stuff are probably not actually mocapped. And so they're they're getting added in and they're at a

15:20.340 --> 15:25.940
different stage. So other comments in chat as to 100 Matt says the problem this is going to cause

15:26.020 --> 15:30.020
not just would take to stock will take a hit tomorrow. But also the employees will be under

15:30.020 --> 15:34.820
a lot of scrutiny now work from home arrangements may be revisited for some folks video and

15:34.820 --> 15:40.100
screenshots not shared in slack probably this leak is going to make stabs lies very difficult. Yeah,

15:40.100 --> 15:48.580
that's a very realistic look at the situation. I mean, with what minimal we've heard about how this

15:48.580 --> 15:55.300
leak happened. I heard in there. It came from an employee's slack account. So one of two things

15:55.300 --> 16:00.500
happen. And I think one is far more likely than the other one. You have a disgruntled employee.

16:00.500 --> 16:05.700
I think that's the less likely one. Yeah, because just people are going to be afraid of this

16:05.700 --> 16:10.740
contracts because yeah, the guy that basically said they hacked this did the same thing to Uber

16:10.740 --> 16:18.900
in the same, you know, method to infiltrate it was social, social engineering. So she get the

16:18.900 --> 16:23.940
credentials for an employee's slack account, and then downloading the information based off that

16:23.940 --> 16:30.420
and see. I mean, I don't, I don't understand slack too much. But like, why is your source

16:30.420 --> 16:36.820
code for your game linked in your slack account? Like, well, I mean, like the full back it up,

16:36.820 --> 16:43.700
it probably opened the door to being able to from slack, get other credentials to log into place.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.500
Like I don't think the source code was just sitting there on slack. I think there were

16:46.500 --> 16:50.660
other credentials, as that person was going through the different chat rooms and so forth,

16:50.660 --> 16:55.700
probably found maybe an internal leak. Maybe it turned out the person's slack login was also

16:55.700 --> 16:58.900
some type of intranet login. Like there's a million things that could have happened

16:58.900 --> 17:03.300
that I think it was, I don't think it's like the source code was just posted there to pin post on

17:03.300 --> 17:09.860
slack. It's not that, but I think it was the first, first breadcrumb to get to that stuff

17:09.860 --> 17:15.540
is what it was. I think that's how it happened. And my question is, if it was social engineering,

17:15.540 --> 17:20.740
where the hell was two factor authentication? I realize there are very sophisticated ways to get

17:20.740 --> 17:26.580
around that nowadays. So I guess it could have been there, but I would say if two factor auth

17:26.580 --> 17:32.740
wasn't enabled and mandated for everybody, it sure will be tomorrow. And quite honestly,

17:33.460 --> 17:38.420
even if you're not at take two, two factor authentication is going to be mandatory for

17:38.420 --> 17:43.300
you in the next couple of weeks, if not already. At my work, you can't get into anything without

17:43.300 --> 17:48.660
being on a specific VPN. Yeah. Yeah. Now Bobby Black Wolf does point out, and yes, I do. I'm not

17:48.660 --> 17:53.140
a complete dummy. I know that there are ways around two factor authentication.

17:53.140 --> 17:57.460
So Bobby Black Wolf says grabbing session tokens gets around two factor auth. I do know that,

17:57.460 --> 18:04.900
but haven't we heard way too much in the news? Like this is how in politics, do you remember

18:04.900 --> 18:11.620
the whole Democrat email server breach and this whole thing? That was all a targeted phishing

18:11.620 --> 18:17.780
social, it was all that. And the person did not have two factor authentication because it wasn't

18:17.780 --> 18:22.660
required for whatever reason, and they got in there. So this type of stuff unfortunately

18:22.660 --> 18:29.060
happens a lot, even without two factor auth. And somebody probably didn't realize, oh, we probably

18:29.060 --> 18:33.140
need this on Slack as well because all these breadcrumbs lead these different directions.

18:33.140 --> 18:38.420
Again, I'm not the hacker, so I don't know how they did it, but based on the limited information

18:38.420 --> 18:44.180
we have, I don't see how it's not this one way or the other. And now this is the part that

18:44.180 --> 18:50.180
has to be looked at is how are people logging into these applications like Slack or Microsoft

18:50.180 --> 18:55.940
Teams, whatever it is, what kind of information is being put on these things? That's the stuff

18:55.940 --> 19:00.260
that's really going to be under a microscope, I think in the coming weeks, no matter where you're

19:00.260 --> 19:08.820
at, especially at Take-Two, but has this been unique to Take-Two either? No. But what about

19:08.820 --> 19:15.220
Capcom? Remember that just happened not that long ago, and I bet it was a very similar sort of thing,

19:15.220 --> 19:21.860
and so on and so on. So anyway, I wanted to talk a little bit about the Grand Theft Auto Online and

19:21.860 --> 19:28.580
the source code leaking for that. Loki, people are saying that that could bring Grand Theft

19:28.580 --> 19:35.540
Auto Online to its knees. What's your takeaway on that? Probably not. I don't think it will.

19:35.540 --> 19:40.900
If anything, it'll just help with cheat making and stuff like that, but I don't think it will.

19:41.620 --> 19:46.900
And also at this point, if the new game's coming out and there's going to be a new

19:46.900 --> 19:51.060
Grand Theft Auto Online anyways, I don't think it's going to matter. Well, but that thing's

19:51.060 --> 19:54.980
still a cash cow and has to pay to keep the lights on for the next two years while they

19:54.980 --> 19:59.620
polish Grand Theft Auto 6. But I'm not saying Grand Theft Auto Online is going to suddenly

19:59.620 --> 20:06.740
shut down. I mean, worst case scenario, question mark, everybody has to download a new client to

20:06.740 --> 20:12.020
log in. Like they could do some major patches to the client to try to patch out whatever they come

20:12.020 --> 20:18.900
up with. But that could be a huge undertaking in a lot of hours that I'm not sure the company wants

20:18.900 --> 20:23.620
to put onto Grand Theft Auto Online. Well, despite what I don't like with Grand Theft Auto Online

20:23.620 --> 20:30.900
and the way that Rockstar Games handles things, I do the one positive upside you could take from

20:30.900 --> 20:35.300
that is like with the source code leaking for Grand Theft Auto Online, that means that when

20:35.300 --> 20:41.380
they do shut down Grand Theft Auto Online, someone will be able to create dummy servers

20:41.380 --> 20:46.340
for Grand Theft Auto Online to be able to continue that on afterwards. So it is good for video

20:46.340 --> 20:51.940
game preservation in that sense. But I mean, it's already a hacker mess anyways,

20:51.940 --> 20:56.420
and Grand Theft Auto Online anyways, from what I understand, though, I don't see how this is

20:56.420 --> 21:03.140
any different. All right, I heard something about that Grand Theft Auto 5 source code already went

21:03.140 --> 21:07.700
for like $100,000 or something like that on the dark web or whatever you want to call it.

21:07.700 --> 21:12.500
Ah, yeah, whatever that means. Yeah. But, you know, as again, pointed out in chat by

21:12.500 --> 21:16.420
Quest Buster, and I said it earlier, remembers when the Half Life 2 source code was leaked,

21:16.420 --> 21:21.220
like so you know, again, Grand Theft Auto 6 is still going to sell 11 billion copies.

21:21.220 --> 21:28.500
The reality is most people, most people buying that game aren't checking gaming news on Twitter

21:28.500 --> 21:33.860
regularly. That's the fact of the matter. Most people that are buying these games are not the

21:33.860 --> 21:39.860
people that are tuned into looking at leaks and that sort of stuff. And even if they did, again,

21:40.500 --> 21:46.340
I would think most people are going to be like, wow, that looks pretty good. But I guess there's,

21:46.340 --> 21:50.100
you know, gamers are going to be gamers sometimes and everybody's going to have a criticism. But

21:50.180 --> 21:53.460
I mean, understanding that this is still in development stuff,

21:53.460 --> 21:58.340
you know, the stuff that I saw, I was like, wow, okay, now I see why this game is taking forever.

21:58.340 --> 22:03.140
To be honest, like, I'm like, okay, yeah, like, this is definitely like next level graphic stuff.

22:03.140 --> 22:06.660
And I can say this is taking a very long time. I think they're claiming that they're not going

22:06.660 --> 22:12.100
to be crunching their employees, which is why it's been developed over however many years.

22:12.100 --> 22:17.860
Yeah. I mean, let's be honest, like, they're making billions of dollars off of Grand Theft

22:17.860 --> 22:25.220
Auto, like each year. So they have the resources to be able to not stress their employees and to

22:25.220 --> 22:29.620
be able to pay them for the long haul to develop a great game. Like, so there's absolutely no

22:29.620 --> 22:33.780
excuses like, well, we, we had to get it out early because we just didn't have the funding.

22:34.500 --> 22:39.300
No, you have so much money. Like, it's just not even a problem. Yeah.

22:40.260 --> 22:44.100
All right. Well, we'll see what develops tomorrow is going to be I mean, the bummer,

22:44.100 --> 22:48.100
quote unquote, is that for the live folks, we kind of have to wait for tomorrow to see what

22:48.100 --> 22:52.580
Take Two's official response really is. And I bet the lawyers are going to be out there in mass,

22:52.580 --> 22:56.100
shutting down the footage the best they can. I'm sure they're already on it.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.980
You know, once on the internet, always on the internet, it's a very hard thing to-

22:58.980 --> 22:59.780
The post is gone.

22:59.780 --> 23:00.740
What's that?

23:00.740 --> 23:01.860
The forum post is gone.

23:01.860 --> 23:09.620
Oh, yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. So I, you know, all that. Bobby in a chat reposting a Twitter joke.

23:10.180 --> 23:14.260
Breaking news, police have arrested the man suspected of stealing the GTA source code.

23:14.260 --> 23:19.140
However, he immediately respond outside the police station. Yes, yes. Well, but you know,

23:19.140 --> 23:24.340
if this person is caught, if this person is caught, they, I mean, that's what ended up

23:24.340 --> 23:30.660
ultimately happening with the Half-Life 2, if I remember right, is the guy had the gall to contact

23:30.660 --> 23:37.940
Gabe Newell looking for a job and ended up getting arrested by like, it was either the FBI or the

23:37.940 --> 23:42.740
German version of it because I believe the guy was in Germany or, you know, again, this was a

23:42.740 --> 23:48.580
long time ago. My memory is a little rusty, but he was arrested by authorities somewhere on his way

23:48.580 --> 23:52.820
to go talk to Gabe Newell about getting a job when I think Gabe Newell had planned to turn him

23:52.820 --> 23:59.620
in himself. So if this person does get caught, if, there could be harsh penalties. Of course,

24:00.500 --> 24:05.540
if this person is in certain countries where they're not going to extradite and they're not

24:05.540 --> 24:13.220
going to give a shit, then it's not going to matter. So we'll see. Let's see. Let's see.

24:13.860 --> 24:16.980
Dang, there's one other thing I wanted to say on that. Oh, well, it'll come back to me later,

24:16.980 --> 24:21.860
I'm sure. But I'm also looking at chat. Zen Monkey says, I was thinking he was just a fellow gamer

24:21.860 --> 24:28.740
looking to keep your Anthototo online after the server shut down. We'll see. It could have been

24:28.740 --> 24:35.220
somebody, you know, because if I recall correctly, it was either the Witcher 3 source code or the

24:35.460 --> 24:40.660
Cyberpunk source code. Somebody bought that with the intent to give it back to CD Projekt Red.

24:40.660 --> 24:45.220
They bought it with the intent to keep it offline. So I'm not saying that happened here,

24:45.220 --> 24:50.500
but it may have been a, I don't know what you would call it, a white knight or something,

24:50.500 --> 24:57.620
a knight in shining armor. The name escapes me, but somebody tried to do a good thing,

24:57.620 --> 25:01.460
basically, for the company. So we'll see. You mean like a Good Samaritan?

25:01.460 --> 25:06.260
Yeah, Good Samaritan. That's it. Thank you. Trying to do this, you know, but that's a lot

25:06.260 --> 25:13.300
of money to be in a Good Samaritan. All right. Anyhow, we'll see what Monday's response looks

25:13.300 --> 25:16.820
like. For those on the podcast feed, by the time you're hearing this, you'll probably already hear

25:16.820 --> 25:21.540
some stuff from Take Two, and I'd be very curious to see, you know, what they're going to say about

25:21.540 --> 25:26.420
it. I'm not sure there's a lot they can, except emphasizing that they really frown on this being

25:26.420 --> 25:32.340
shared, that it is early in development, and we look forward to showing you an official look,

25:32.340 --> 25:38.100
a polished look at Grand Theft Auto 6 very soon. I'm not sure there's a lot they can say outside

25:38.100 --> 25:43.060
of that. All right, let's talk about the games we have been playing this week in a segment called

25:43.060 --> 25:46.740
How Is Your Gaming Week that we do here every week, and Dark Sakura, let's go to you. How

25:46.740 --> 25:53.060
is your gaming week? Of course, I've been playing Dead by Daylight. I also watched the Light in the

25:53.060 --> 26:01.540
Fog tourney. That was pretty fun. I have been playing Cold to the Lamb. Final Fantasy IV,

26:01.540 --> 26:07.780
I got back to last night. I'm close to beating the game, so I'm either going to do Final Fantasy V or

26:07.780 --> 26:15.380
Star Ocean next. I haven't decided. I think I'm going to do V. Wordscapes have been playing,

26:15.380 --> 26:22.740
Patterned again, because they put out an update for Patterned today. I had something else that's

26:22.900 --> 26:28.260
on. Oh, yeah, and I'm going to be starting Avengers, I think, when I'm done with Cold

26:28.260 --> 26:36.820
to the Lamb. Nice. Playing through Stadia again. Nice. By the way, weren't you, I forgot to ask

26:36.820 --> 26:40.820
you before we were on air, so sorry to spring this on you, but did you still do that other

26:40.820 --> 26:46.740
show today? Did you want to give it a plug? I did. I did do the interview for Stadia dosage,

26:47.620 --> 26:55.860
and I believe it will be live on Tuesday. I'll be given a link soon as to when it will be on,

26:55.860 --> 27:06.260
but it's going to be reposted on YouTube, so look for Stadia dosage. I had just the best time

27:07.620 --> 27:13.940
talking to MM2K, who has also been a long-time listener of us. Oh, that's great. Yeah, and it

27:13.940 --> 27:20.420
was a really good experience. We basically went way off the rails about different topics,

27:20.420 --> 27:26.820
because I think we're both fairly passionately opinionated people, and we talked about the

27:26.820 --> 27:36.020
state of gaming, and about people needing to know their roots, and shaking our canes at the kids on

27:36.020 --> 27:46.260
our lawn. Just the difference that Stadia has made to us, and especially for me, being a Mac gamer,

27:47.140 --> 27:53.620
Stadia has been the way I get to play some of these things, because of incompatibility with

27:53.620 --> 28:03.620
the ARM environment for Windows. There's been some of that going on. Still trying to get me to play

28:03.620 --> 28:14.820
Division, and I don't think I'm going to, but we'll see. We talked for, gosh, maybe three and

28:14.820 --> 28:23.220
a half hours, including the interview. We could have gone more, but I was losing my voice.

28:24.020 --> 28:32.900
So it was a really great experience. I'm looking forward. I don't like to listen to my

28:32.900 --> 28:39.220
voice, as I know that you know, especially right now, since I sound like I've been swallowing gravel.

28:41.540 --> 28:48.020
But I'm thinking it's going to be pretty good. We went over some pretty big

28:48.580 --> 28:58.580
stuff too, just in terms of why 60 frames per second on games is going to be the max

28:59.380 --> 29:07.860
that would be, what's the word I'm thinking of, perceptible by human eyes, outside of going into

29:10.100 --> 29:15.220
long exposures and things, and doing multiple frames in slow-mo, and various.

29:15.940 --> 29:26.980
Like, I know we were talking about CRTs, and why a 60 frames per second game played on a CRT isn't

29:26.980 --> 29:34.820
going to make a big difference, as it would be on a nice LCD screen, about pixel size, scan refresh,

29:35.460 --> 29:46.100
that type of thing. We went into color theory, and just talking about the differences between

29:46.100 --> 29:52.420
the games that we used to play, and the games we're playing now, and updating them, and various,

29:52.420 --> 30:01.700
and talked about, great, my brain just blanked. I was just saying, it sounds like it'll be a

30:01.700 --> 30:10.900
good interview. Is the Stadia dosage, is that a podcast or a YouTube thing?

30:12.980 --> 30:18.820
It's a podcast, but I think you also, if you go to stadiodosage.com, I'll put a link in the chat,

30:19.700 --> 30:21.860
there is how you get to everything.

30:22.580 --> 30:23.460
Nice, okay.

30:23.460 --> 30:36.900
And yeah, it's really good. He's got some blog content on there too.

30:38.500 --> 30:47.140
There's videos for the show and everything. So I think, I know it's on YouTube, and I'm sorry,

30:48.100 --> 30:54.740
he didn't actually say that there's content on Stitcher and a few others. So

30:55.860 --> 30:57.700
I think the audio is recapped.

30:57.700 --> 31:02.420
Stitcher is just a podcast app. So yeah, I'm sure it's, that's cool. Great. All right.

31:04.020 --> 31:13.220
I'm pretty excited about some of the stuff happening in the Stadiaverse.

31:13.940 --> 31:20.260
All right. Well, we'll check in on the show later this week, it sounds like. All right. Well,

31:20.260 --> 31:23.060
if that's it for your gaming week, let's go over to Loki. How was your gaming week?

31:24.180 --> 31:31.220
It was all Minecraft again. Still working on my big build. So it is going to be the biggest

31:31.220 --> 31:36.580
build I've ever done. So until you decide next time, I want to go even bigger.

31:36.580 --> 31:39.460
Yep. Until next time.

31:41.060 --> 31:47.220
Perfect. All right. Well, that's short and sweet. All right. My gaming week,

31:47.220 --> 31:51.700
a lot of the same type of stuff. Still been playing Final Fantasy 14. My island sanctuary

31:51.700 --> 31:57.540
is up to level nine. So I'm almost max level in the casual mini game, but I love the island

31:57.540 --> 32:01.620
sanctuary stuff. It's very, I like to just sit there and gather while I either like watch Twitch

32:01.620 --> 32:06.500
channels or YouTubes or whatever. So that's been very, very good to pass the time. So still playing

32:06.500 --> 32:13.060
Final Fantasy 14. I finished the story patch content a long time ago. I don't really do

32:13.060 --> 32:18.660
Savage rating. I don't really have the time or group to commit to it. So I just kind of take

32:18.660 --> 32:22.740
the content that's there. I'm still really looking forward to the mid patch because it's supposed to

32:22.740 --> 32:27.620
add in like a new type of endless dungeon sort of thing. So I'm really curious to see what that's

32:27.620 --> 32:32.820
all about. So that'll be coming soon-ish. Otherwise, I've also been playing Diablo 3

32:32.820 --> 32:38.180
and a lot of it. In fact, I've hit the point. My character is now Paragon, I think 730.

32:38.180 --> 32:44.180
I think I hit. Now, the interesting thing about that, my non-seasonal Paragon or my

32:44.180 --> 32:51.540
non-seasonal character is Paragon 715. What that means, anytime you beat a season, all of the XP

32:51.540 --> 32:56.340
just dumps into your non-season characters. So what that means, right now in season 27,

32:56.340 --> 33:03.860
that started a few weeks ago, I have more XP than my entire career over the last 10 years combined.

33:04.740 --> 33:11.540
Now, I know, right? But here's some things to keep in mind. It's not exactly a one for one because

33:11.540 --> 33:18.820
as these seasons keep going, they add new things so that you can progress farther into deeper rifts

33:18.820 --> 33:25.940
where you get more XP. So I would say it's easier now to do a Torment 16 is no big deal

33:26.020 --> 33:31.940
when the game used to cap out at Torment 6 and the greater rifts you could do were only so good

33:31.940 --> 33:36.980
after that. So they've added things like ancients, primal ancients, and now there's this whole

33:36.980 --> 33:43.300
arcane dust thing that they're doing in the recent season. So it's not quite one for one,

33:43.300 --> 33:47.780
but still, I was pretty impressed to think like, wow, I have more XP on this character in five

33:47.780 --> 33:55.380
weeks than my entire previous career. It's pretty something. I've also been playing Dead by Daylight

33:55.380 --> 33:59.620
as well. I was playing on stream with some friends on Friday. I think once again, Dark

33:59.620 --> 34:04.660
Sakura, I went and I checked back later and you had taken my place. I think they'd cycled a few

34:04.660 --> 34:09.220
people through, but you had taken my place, so to speak, on a Taze Friday stream and that cracked me

34:09.220 --> 34:13.460
up. So I hope you guys are having fun. I did come in when there were only three people in there and

34:13.460 --> 34:17.140
I was joking, let me play with you. And I was like, no, I'm actually, I just got home and I'm

34:17.140 --> 34:20.580
kind of tired. And he's like, actually, if you want to join in on the next round, I'm like, okay.

34:21.140 --> 34:26.180
Nice. I don't know how it went for you. We had some really good matches. Like,

34:26.180 --> 34:32.980
we escaped almost every time except for the last match I played, the killer decided to tunnel me

34:32.980 --> 34:36.260
out, which- We had some really stinky people. Yeah.

34:36.260 --> 34:40.900
I mean, but I don't know if you saw the screenshot that I put up on my Twitter

34:41.620 --> 34:46.420
of us both slugged on Freddy's dirty mattress. Oh, Lord.

34:46.740 --> 34:54.020
Yeah, it was, you know, and we were having fun. I mean, it was always a fun time. I like to,

34:54.660 --> 34:59.780
you know, I've decided, it's just something for myself, that if I'm in a match with a stinky

34:59.780 --> 35:02.420
person, the moment I realize they're stinky, I'm going to fuck with them.

35:02.980 --> 35:06.660
Yeah. I mean, you know, and people, you know, I get asked this sometimes, like,

35:06.660 --> 35:10.340
why do you keep playing that game when you talk about how terrible a lot of the players are?

35:10.340 --> 35:13.620
Because you know what, when you are playing with friends or even if you're just, it is a lot of

35:14.500 --> 35:18.820
fun. Like, it's just, you know what, because the match is over in 15, 20 minutes, and then you

35:18.820 --> 35:21.460
move on to the next match and it's whatever. Exactly.

35:21.460 --> 35:22.820
Yeah. Well, there's some people,

35:22.820 --> 35:28.660
though, who don't let themselves get over it and are just, I don't know.

35:28.660 --> 35:32.740
That's why I love this new anonymous mode. So people only, because, so they added a new thing

35:32.740 --> 35:35.460
in the last patch where, you already know this, but I'm explaining for the listeners,

35:36.180 --> 35:40.740
where you can replace your name with the name of the character you're playing. So for example,

35:40.740 --> 35:45.220
if I'm playing Chris Redfield, then my name just shows as Chris Redfield, like 02 or 03,

35:45.220 --> 35:50.420
whatever player number slot I'm in. So the other players, they can, they can talk all the smack

35:50.420 --> 35:53.380
they want, but that's it. They got to leave it in the match because there's no way to find me

35:53.380 --> 35:59.140
afterwards. So it's that, you know. Well, but even on top of that though,

35:59.140 --> 36:07.300
I mean, it's just, it does get on, on you after you've had stink after stink after stink, you

36:07.300 --> 36:16.500
know? And I've really just been trying to, you know, put myself a little bit past it,

36:17.220 --> 36:24.420
you know, like, okay, so they're a piece of shit. Great. I don't have to dwell on it.

36:24.420 --> 36:30.500
Once the game is over, they don't exist in my universe. That's what I'm trying to do.

36:31.140 --> 36:37.860
You know, if it's bad enough, then maybe I will, you know, submit a, uh, you know, uh,

36:38.500 --> 36:43.460
a video or, or something, you know, and then certainly not going to not talk about it.

36:44.260 --> 36:50.580
You know, I want to make sure that they, cause like there were these people the other day who

36:50.580 --> 36:59.860
are going, Oh, uh, kills the skills. I'm like, no, it's not. Kill is when you go and you give

36:59.860 --> 37:08.340
everyone a fair chance to enjoy the game. Kill is when you're not just setting traps, you know,

37:08.340 --> 37:13.140
unless you're playing trapper. Uh, you know, we were studying using a slugged person as bait or

37:13.780 --> 37:20.900
just face camping somebody. And on top of that now I just flat out someone's face camping. I just,

37:20.900 --> 37:23.940
I don't bother getting them. I just go in and do gens.

37:23.940 --> 37:27.140
Exactly. That's what you have to do. Well, the reassurance perk, if,

37:27.140 --> 37:30.740
if you're running it, which I usually don't, but it's extremely helpful now for those,

37:30.740 --> 37:39.380
you know, face campers is great on two story levels. Yeah. Yeah. Cause then you can totally

37:39.380 --> 37:46.660
just, uh, run above them. Yeah. Anyway. Um, there was dead by daylight, but here's,

37:46.660 --> 37:49.860
here's the other game I've been playing this weekend. This one even surprised me,

37:49.860 --> 37:53.540
but, um, and I'm sure it'll come up again later in the show. So sorry if I'm, uh,

37:53.540 --> 37:58.740
biting a story here, but, um, you know, with Tokyo game show, Microsoft made several announcements

37:58.740 --> 38:02.980
and they announced, you know, they were kind of focused on game pass a lot as they have been

38:02.980 --> 38:06.980
lately in the States and other countries. So why wouldn't they do the same for Japan?

38:06.980 --> 38:11.140
Uh, and they added a lot of stuff to game pass. And one of the games they added to game pass was

38:11.140 --> 38:16.020
Assassin's Creed Odyssey. And I was like, Hmm, what the heck? I want to download this to see

38:16.020 --> 38:21.700
what it's all about. And I have to admit, it took me a minute to get into it. I wasn't super

38:21.700 --> 38:28.500
feeling it in the beginning, but as the game kind of started to ramp up a little bit and like the

38:28.500 --> 38:33.620
world started opening up and I was getting branching questing paths, I'm kind of into it

38:33.620 --> 38:39.300
now. Uh, and yeah, you know, I don't usually play these games. It's not, I don't know. I just,

38:39.860 --> 38:45.940
I don't know why I just never have been, uh, super into the, the actiony, I think because I don't

38:45.940 --> 38:51.860
really care for like stealth stuff. And I know Assassin's Creed is a lot of that, but because,

38:51.860 --> 38:56.260
you know, how many of these games have there been by now? A ton, right? So they've learned

38:56.260 --> 39:00.740
from each game. And a lot of them are in Stadia. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, and, but the thing with

39:00.740 --> 39:04.260
Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and I'm sure some of the other more recent ones do this too,

39:04.980 --> 39:11.380
but they, they have Bobby Black Wolf mode in it left and right. And it's, it's very easy. The

39:11.380 --> 39:18.180
stealth part is not difficult. And even if you get seen, the enemies are like, what, what's that?

39:18.180 --> 39:24.020
What's going on? They're kind of like slowly walking. Like it's just like very over the top

39:24.020 --> 39:29.380
in like, they're not very skilled. Um, and you even can get an ability like right off the bat

39:29.380 --> 39:34.980
where like, if you get seen, you can slow time instantly. So you can fire off an arrow shot

39:34.980 --> 39:39.620
and still get like the first hit on him, even when you get seen. So they've, and I'm sure there

39:39.620 --> 39:45.220
are a lot of people that will be like, well, that's not skill. That's I don't care. You sit

39:45.220 --> 39:50.100
down and shut up and let me play my game the way I want to. And having those five seconds to get

39:50.100 --> 39:56.180
that perfect headshot in with an arrow is just, is that's what I needed to make the game a little

39:56.180 --> 40:02.340
more welcoming and interesting. And, um, yeah, I've been, I've been having fun with it and it

40:02.340 --> 40:07.780
is really pretty. I will say this. It is really, really pretty because, um, I haven't been able to,

40:07.780 --> 40:12.820
you know, I got this new PC a few months ago and I haven't played a lot of cutting edge 4k games on

40:12.820 --> 40:20.900
it, but this game looks, looks marvelous, uh, on my system. It's, it's beautiful. Uh, I can't wait

40:20.900 --> 40:25.220
to get to some more varied environments, but like I was in a cave and I was like, oh, this like

40:25.220 --> 40:29.060
Tomb Raider I'm playing right now. This is cool. And then like, you know, some of the outside world

40:29.060 --> 40:34.740
is very pretty that you, you take over a bird and some portions of the bird helps you see what's

40:34.740 --> 40:39.140
going on, like literally a bird's eye view. So you can assess the situation before you go in

40:39.140 --> 40:44.260
there. And like the way it handles it is very seamless and very, very cool. So yeah, I think,

40:44.260 --> 40:49.220
I think I'm into Assassin's Creed all of a sudden, isn't that weird and wild, but this game is

40:49.220 --> 40:55.140
interesting. Let me tell you the one complaint I have. So for, and this is, this is a silly

40:55.140 --> 41:00.740
complaint, but I don't care. It's a complaint. So, you know, I'm spoiled by things like Mass Effect,

41:01.380 --> 41:06.740
where you can create your own character. In this game, you can, you can at least pick your

41:06.740 --> 41:12.900
character. Now you can play either Alexios, male, you can play Cassandra, a female. You couldn't

41:12.900 --> 41:20.180
always even pick between those two. Um, but like Alexios, I just, I kind of wish I could make them

41:20.180 --> 41:26.900
look different. Like I just don't really care for the base model. Um, but okay, whatever. And,

41:26.900 --> 41:33.540
and why didn't I play Cassandra? I really could have, but I heard, I heard there was, uh,

41:33.540 --> 41:39.220
same sex romance available in the game. So for that reason, I'm going to stick with Alexios.

41:39.780 --> 41:41.140
So, um,

41:41.140 --> 41:49.620
There was one I was interested in and it was, um, because in one of my art history classes, our

41:49.620 --> 41:55.540
teacher talking about the Vatican, um, put up a picture of a screenshot from, I want to say it

41:55.540 --> 42:02.180
was Assassin's Creed 2. Yeah, probably. That, uh, was actually a pretty faithful recreation

42:02.180 --> 42:08.980
of what this particular block in Italy was supposed to look like. And ever since then,

42:08.980 --> 42:12.340
I was like, I just want to play it and explore and not do any of the missions.

42:12.340 --> 42:17.460
That, no, that is legit a mode in the newer games. Like maybe not Assassin's Creed 2,

42:17.460 --> 42:21.620
but like, I haven't explored it yet. Maybe Quest Buster or somebody who knows the series better

42:21.620 --> 42:26.420
than I do can elaborate, but I noticed there's an option on the main menu called discovery.

42:26.420 --> 42:31.460
And I think with the last game, so the last game, uh, the name escapes you. It might've been

42:31.460 --> 42:36.340
origins, but it was ancient Egypt themed. And I think they started there where you just like,

42:36.340 --> 42:40.980
you can have like a history exploration mode where you just like are exploring the pyramids

42:40.980 --> 42:45.300
in the game and this stuff. And I believe they did it here too, where you just are exploring

42:45.300 --> 42:50.020
ancient Greece. Uh, and that whole thing, uh, that Quest Buster says in origins and Odyssey,

42:50.020 --> 42:54.660
there is a tour mode. You can enable to just walk around and get the history behind the areas.

42:54.660 --> 43:02.420
So, so there you go right up your alley. Right. So yeah. Yeah. So you don't, you don't,

43:02.420 --> 43:07.460
if that's the game for you, that can literally be the game for you. I think that's pretty cool.

43:08.020 --> 43:12.020
Uh, it's interesting because now there's ads for the new Assassin's Creed Mirage,

43:12.020 --> 43:15.940
like all over the title screen and stuff. It's interesting how they can kind of do that,

43:16.580 --> 43:21.220
um, in the, in the interface. But, uh, yeah, so I know I never thought I would become like

43:21.220 --> 43:25.940
an Assassin's Creed fan, but I'm kind of like into this game. So we'll see, we'll see how we'll see,

43:25.940 --> 43:29.940
you know, it's going to take me what, like 50 hours to beat it. So check in with me again in

43:29.940 --> 43:35.300
a couple of weeks. Cause they also released Nino Cooney remastered edition on game pass.

43:35.300 --> 43:40.420
And I've been very tempted to revisit that game, especially now that it's remastered, but, um,

43:40.420 --> 43:46.740
you know, we'll see. We'll see. All right. That's plenty for my gaming week. Let's get into some

43:46.740 --> 43:56.020
other gaming news. Um, it was a busy week. Like I said, yeah, short and sweet Minecraft, the biggest

43:57.700 --> 44:06.820
realm ever. His biggest build ever build ever. Yes. So it's going to be amazing. You'll, I you'll

44:06.820 --> 44:10.180
have to see what it looks like. Yeah. Did you see the Tokyo game show, uh,

44:10.180 --> 44:14.420
sale on steam by the way? Ooh, no, I didn't. Is there some good stuff on there?

44:14.420 --> 44:19.700
There's like a Ninja Gaiden master collection and a lot of the final fantasy updates. And,

44:19.700 --> 44:27.620
but one that kind of surprised me was seeing a layer section. Um, which is probably one of the

44:27.620 --> 44:31.060
favorite shooters we have in the house is actually galactic attack in a layer section.

44:32.020 --> 44:38.420
Um, I mean, we've got them on Saturn, but, but I mean, and there's some pretty decent, uh,

44:38.420 --> 44:42.500
mat games on there too, like some cute little stuff, but I was actually just really

44:43.300 --> 44:49.220
surprised to see some of the ones on here. Um, also, uh, one of the, the 3d Toho games.

44:50.100 --> 44:52.500
Well, you mentioned the final fan. If those are the pixel,

44:52.500 --> 44:58.100
uh, Toho mechanical, uh, schoolery. If those are the, um, pixel remasters for

44:58.100 --> 45:01.460
final fantasy, I do want to go back and pick more of them up. Cause I like, they,

45:01.460 --> 45:05.780
they did a good job with four. I w that's the only one I bought. I only allowed myself to buy final

45:05.780 --> 45:12.260
fantasy four and I liked it. Um, but I resisted buying any of the others because I was convinced

45:12.260 --> 45:17.460
they were going to put them all out on switch at some point, but now June has come and gone.

45:17.460 --> 45:22.260
Now Tokyo game shows come and gone with the Nintendo direct to play and no sign of the pixel

45:22.260 --> 45:26.820
remasters. So I have a feeling maybe they're not going to put it on console after all. Of course,

45:26.820 --> 45:30.100
they're just waiting for me to buy it and then it'll get put on console.

45:31.540 --> 45:37.940
So, um, there's a game that I have on my list when it comes out called drill man rumble.

45:39.220 --> 45:43.300
That's like a fighting game with people with giant drills.

45:44.180 --> 45:49.460
Nice. Uh, and over in chat, of course the classic is on there by the way. Sorry.

45:49.460 --> 45:54.100
No, that's right. The classic joke of Bobby black Wolf hates Nino Cooney has come up in our chat

45:54.100 --> 45:59.220
room, uh, talking about the demo, because if y'all didn't remember and, you know, to explain

45:59.220 --> 46:04.820
a years old and joke at this point, the original demo for Nino Cooney was terrible because it did

46:04.820 --> 46:09.860
not give enough explanation as to what the hell was going on in the game. And so it was just,

46:09.860 --> 46:14.820
it really was not fun to play through and it really did not get leave a good impression for

46:14.820 --> 46:19.940
the game. But by the time the game came out, I ended up playing it anyway. And I actually liked

46:19.940 --> 46:25.140
it. And I was like, wow, they did a really shit job with the demo because they did not, uh, make

46:25.140 --> 46:29.620
this game as good as it actually is. I remember playing Nino Cooney 2 as well, which I believe

46:30.580 --> 46:36.500
had some differences. It's been years since I've touched either one of them, but Nino Cooney 2

46:36.500 --> 46:41.540
wasn't bad either. So I'm curious about the remaster for the first one, because despite,

46:41.540 --> 46:44.740
you know, all this, you know, stuff that Bobby black Wolf says about the demo,

46:45.700 --> 46:52.980
it is time to let a PlayStation 3 demo go now that we're on a remasters on, uh, you know,

46:52.980 --> 46:59.220
PlayStation 4 slash 5. And so, uh, I'm curious, especially now it's on game pass, like, you know,

46:59.220 --> 47:02.900
hello, you don't have to pay anything extra for it if you're already paying for game pass.

47:02.900 --> 47:08.180
So it makes a pretty good case to check it out. And of course, never, never forget, never forgive

47:08.180 --> 47:15.380
you typical gamers. You all in chat. All right, let's move on and talk about speaking of

47:15.380 --> 47:20.740
PlayStation. Thanks to Tokyo game show this week, we got a lot of PlayStation news in a,

47:20.740 --> 47:25.940
in a state of play. I keep saying PlayStation direct. We all know what influenced PlayStation

47:25.940 --> 47:29.860
state of play. We all know where it's a PlayStation direct, which is just their own branding. We get

47:29.860 --> 47:36.420
it. It's just, it's Sony being on brand with stealing Nintendo ideas. Yeah. Um, so yes,

47:36.500 --> 47:40.580
they had a state of play event where they showed off a bunch of different games,

47:40.580 --> 47:46.500
including trailers for Tekken eight, which looks pretty awesome. Uh, they just have like a little

47:46.500 --> 47:51.700
animated, I don't even know if it was really gameplay, but basically saying that stay tuned

47:51.700 --> 47:57.860
for more information about that, uh, star Wars tales from the galaxies edge enhanced edition,

47:57.860 --> 48:01.780
which is an enhanced version of the game that came out in the Oculus quest.

48:02.580 --> 48:07.140
And that's supposed to be out for the PlayStation VR to whenever that's out, uh,

48:07.140 --> 48:12.580
Demeo is coming to the PlayStation VR too, as well. It's like a tabletop, uh, VR game

48:12.580 --> 48:20.820
and it looks pretty cool. Uh, like a dragon Asian, which is another, uh, Yakuza spinoff game.

48:20.820 --> 48:24.100
Although, you know, not to be confused, I think like a dragon, I'm not sure if they're

48:24.740 --> 48:29.780
re rebranding their whole Yakuza series. I will talk about this in a little bit. Exactly.

48:29.860 --> 48:34.580
But anyways, uh, it's, it's, if you're thinking like a dragon being like the other,

48:34.580 --> 48:40.260
like a dragon game, uh, it's not, it's more of like an action brawler type thing. I thought

48:40.260 --> 48:45.380
they were, I thought they were making the, uh, dragon quest RPG, the new standard. I thought

48:45.380 --> 48:52.020
that was the thing moving forward. Uh, no, this one does not look like that at all. So if it is,

48:52.020 --> 48:58.180
it's doesn't reflect it. The gameplay trailer does not reflect that. Interesting. Um,

48:59.140 --> 49:03.700
Hogwarts legacy got a new trailer, um, supposed to be coming out February 10th,

49:04.580 --> 49:09.540
uh, Pacific drive looks interesting. I'm sorry. I have to get this off my chest. I am so mad

49:10.180 --> 49:16.340
that that dumb woman who wrote a book once ruined the, this series for me because I, you know,

49:16.340 --> 49:23.060
I look at that and I go, huh, it looks neat, but like, I, I can't bring myself to care at all about

49:23.460 --> 49:28.900
that universe whatsoever. And it just, it just stinks. It's just, and I under look,

49:28.900 --> 49:32.740
there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. I get that people have to pick and choose their

49:32.740 --> 49:36.420
own battles. There's going to be people that buy that game, whatever you do, you bestie.

49:36.420 --> 49:41.540
But I just, I can't bring myself to give a hoot about that game. And I'm just so angry at that

49:41.540 --> 49:46.980
dumb woman for what she did to her own franchise. Anyway, I just, I'm sorry. I have to get that off

49:46.980 --> 49:54.340
my chest. Yeah. Um, Pacific drive looks interesting. It's kind of like a first person

49:54.340 --> 50:01.780
dystopian, like I guess a road trip type game. Um, it almost looks like the long drive, except if

50:01.780 --> 50:08.260
it were a competent game and also had like weird stuff in there. Thank you. Chat room is clarified.

50:08.260 --> 50:12.100
I didn't catch this, that you actually were talking about the two different games there.

50:12.100 --> 50:18.260
Asian was a game that already existed. And so it was kind of like a, a precursor, if you will,

50:18.260 --> 50:23.620
to you cause like a dragon that is not turn-based that because it wasn't in the series wasn't that

50:23.620 --> 50:29.620
way, but now the mainline numbered games will be turn-based. So that's, that's what's going on

50:29.620 --> 50:36.020
there. Cool. Thank you, Chad. Um, they talked a little bit about PlayStation stars, which is

50:36.020 --> 50:42.740
their rewards program. That sounds like NFTs without saying that it's NFTs, but it's basically

50:42.740 --> 50:50.180
you earn digital collectibles, which sounds so much like NFTs. And when they showed it,

50:50.180 --> 50:56.420
it looks like NFTs, except I'm not sure if you can sell them. It's like, it's like, if you will,

50:56.420 --> 51:03.060
um, the PlayStation trophies you would get in PlayStation home and being able to share like

51:03.060 --> 51:07.300
little things that like, almost like achievements for that, but I'm not sure where you get these

51:07.300 --> 51:13.300
from. And if you can trade them or whatever and sell them, then that sounds like NFTs, but it's

51:13.300 --> 51:17.940
just stinks like NFTs right now. That was the exact same thing I was worried about when I first

51:17.940 --> 51:25.060
heard about that. I was like, is this NFTs? Cause yikes. Uh, there's some. It smell like an NFT

51:25.700 --> 51:32.820
and it looked like an NFT. Some third person, um, like power armor combat game, um,

51:33.940 --> 51:41.380
called sin duality looked okay. Um, stellar blade kind of resembles a little bit of like a,

51:41.940 --> 51:51.380
you know, anime, um, protagonist, dark souls type game. Looks neat, I guess, uh, rise of Ronan,

51:51.380 --> 51:57.700
which is a new team Ninja game and, um, almost reminds me a little bit of an assassin screen

51:57.700 --> 52:05.060
type thing, which, you know, neat, uh, got a war. Ragnarok has a controller that's coming out and

52:05.060 --> 52:10.980
they also showed off a new story trailer as well for the game. And those are out in November.

52:10.980 --> 52:15.700
And that was clearly the big thing that they were waiting to show off was, you know,

52:15.700 --> 52:19.060
God of war. Cause that's going to be their big holiday title, obviously. So yeah.

52:19.700 --> 52:26.020
Yeah. Is that game also on PS4? It is, isn't it? Yeah. Cause I guess technically they still don't

52:26.020 --> 52:31.540
have PlayStation fives on target shelves. Although most people are saying they're relatively easier

52:31.540 --> 52:36.900
to come by now than they were. So I still haven't seen them in stores. I have seen,

52:36.900 --> 52:40.820
I think you still have to play the game a little bit, but you don't have to play it as hard as you

52:40.820 --> 52:48.420
used to. Yeah. Like the Sony direct thing is a pretty reliable way to get them. I think is,

52:48.420 --> 52:51.700
is what I'm hearing now. Yeah. I've been holding out. Cause I was going to see if

52:51.700 --> 52:54.740
they were going to refresh them this year. That's what I thought might happen is there

52:54.740 --> 53:00.100
might be a refresh. Um, but now I'm just honestly, at this point, I'm holding off to it. Cause

53:00.100 --> 53:06.260
this is what inevitably always happens, you know, and Sony really has nobody, but well,

53:06.260 --> 53:09.700
I would say themselves, but the industry does this. It doesn't matter. You could be Microsoft

53:09.700 --> 53:14.980
and this is a halo console console. You could be Nintendo and this is a splatoon three.

53:15.060 --> 53:20.980
It's not even a halo console anymore. Uh, yeah, yeah, we, uh, not after last what's happened,

53:20.980 --> 53:24.340
but you know what I mean? Or it could be a splatoon three console comes out and then

53:24.340 --> 53:30.020
literally like the next week, a, uh, scarlet violet Pokemon one comes out like in Nintendo.

53:30.020 --> 53:35.300
But my point is now I'm waiting to see if a final fantasy 16 PlayStation five or something branded

53:35.300 --> 53:40.980
with that comes out. We did see there was the Ragnarok controller coming. That looked very

53:40.980 --> 53:46.500
pretty, um, for that. So it just, it just seems like, and maybe it, because maybe it wouldn't

53:46.500 --> 53:50.500
be in good taste to do a limited edition console while they're still hard to come by. I don't know.

53:50.500 --> 53:56.260
Um, but they're not doing a full Ragnarok console at least as far as we know. So, but if they do a

53:56.260 --> 54:01.140
sick, that's what I'm holding out for now. That's why I'm not getting a PlayStation five yet is that

54:01.140 --> 54:06.260
number one, I have a computer now good enough to play pretty much anything. And Sony is putting

54:06.260 --> 54:12.260
out most stuff on PC. Now, if final fantasy 16 is not same date on PC, which I'm not expecting

54:12.260 --> 54:16.980
it to be, then I will get a PlayStation five just for that game because I am a fan boy.

54:18.260 --> 54:25.860
Yeah. Um, another bit of information that wasn't necessarily included in the state of play, it's

54:25.860 --> 54:31.300
come out that the PlayStation two VR will not be backwards compatible with the PlayStation one VR,

54:31.300 --> 54:35.940
which makes sense when you think about it. Cause I mean, this is the system for tracking

54:36.180 --> 54:41.620
controllers are completely different. Like it would be hard to retrofit all of that stuff

54:41.620 --> 54:47.860
back in there to get that stuff all compatible. Um, yeah. When I first heard the news, I was like,

54:47.860 --> 54:54.580
what the fuck? What a, what a, what a terrible thing to do, you know, that to close off the

54:54.580 --> 55:00.900
PlayStation VR one library. But then when I really sat down to think about it and read some followup

55:00.900 --> 55:05.620
conversation, I was like, Oh yeah, they completely changed the tracking where there's actually no

55:05.620 --> 55:11.620
camera that looks at you anymore. There's no more red and blue balls on the place that would

55:11.620 --> 55:15.860
completely change the way that beat saber detection is working and things like that.

55:15.860 --> 55:22.500
I'm sure many of the all star titles will be redone for play. I there, well, I keep saying

55:22.500 --> 55:26.580
there will absolutely be a beat saber, but now that I think about it, that's all owned,

55:27.380 --> 55:32.580
but I, they would be silly not to do it, but I guess anything's possible.

55:32.580 --> 55:34.020
They are a silly company.

55:34.020 --> 55:37.940
It's true. That is true. But Tetris effect, I imagine certainly will have a PSVR too.

55:37.940 --> 55:43.780
I would see like, you know, and it's, it's good that we maybe get a, you know, a remaster of

55:43.780 --> 55:48.180
until dawn rush of blood, you know, would be nice with some extra levels, please.

55:48.180 --> 55:56.420
Yeah. So I understand why it's not backwards compatible. It stinks. You kind of wish there

55:56.420 --> 56:00.980
was a way for them to just say, well, can't you just kind of have an easy translate emulate that?

56:00.980 --> 56:06.580
No, it's not. It's not that easy, but hopefully it won't be too difficult for the all star games

56:06.580 --> 56:13.220
to be repackaged. It does suck. But I mean, you can still play your PlayStation VR on the

56:13.220 --> 56:19.460
PlayStation five, I think. So you just have to have the whole headsets. Yeah. And the camera

56:19.460 --> 56:28.260
and the move controller. Yeah. There is all that. So what did you think overall of the PlayStation

56:28.260 --> 56:31.780
state of play? Loki, were you, were you pleased with it? Were you kind of like,

56:31.780 --> 56:33.700
I wish there'd been more or where were you at with that?

56:33.700 --> 56:38.420
There's a lot of games I'm not really interested in, honestly. I mean, some of it looks good.

56:38.420 --> 56:42.020
I've got a war. I haven't really played the last God of war game.

56:42.020 --> 56:48.740
So I'm not super excited about it, but I know it's a good game. Yeah. I don't know.

56:48.740 --> 56:51.700
Not really super excited about anything that they showed.

56:51.700 --> 56:57.380
Um, I think the things that jumped out to me, um, even though I'm not a huge God of war person,

56:57.380 --> 57:01.780
although, you know, it's new year, new me, anything can happen now, clearly based on my

57:01.780 --> 57:06.500
gaming week. So never say never. Um, I think the games that really stood out to me, Pacific drive

57:06.500 --> 57:11.300
looked kind of, it was very stylish and, you know, I like a good driving game,

57:11.300 --> 57:15.540
although I understand there's more to it than that, but that, uh, the one that kind of surprised me,

57:16.180 --> 57:23.300
was Demi-O, the one that was the tabletop RPG kind of in that VR space because I'm

57:23.940 --> 57:29.540
admittedly not the Dungeons and Dragons and tabletop fan that a lot of other people are.

57:29.540 --> 57:35.060
I'm certainly not a hater. I think it's a great creative outlet and like, maybe I just kind of

57:35.060 --> 57:39.380
wish I had a group and I'd play it more regularly. I don't know. You know, that's on PC though.

57:39.940 --> 57:42.500
Oh, the Demi-O? Yeah, it's already out on PC.

57:43.460 --> 57:48.100
See, that's good to know. That's good to know. Uh, and then Tekken 8 looked, you know,

57:48.100 --> 57:51.940
looks pretty, you know, even though we kind of, we kind of knew it was coming. Uh, it's,

57:51.940 --> 57:56.740
it's still nice to have it confirmed and it looked very pretty. Um, you know, rain, rain and more

57:56.740 --> 58:04.420
rain. Yes. All right. Um, going to chat a lot of comments on the, uh, PSVR stuff. Bobby, uh,

58:04.420 --> 58:09.220
Black Wolf, who's on before us here at VOG Network says it's easier to write the new tracking into

58:09.220 --> 58:13.460
your game than it is to build an entire emulation layer to translate what your game is looking for

58:13.460 --> 58:19.220
into what the PSVR 2 is actually able to detect. Is it possible? Yes. Well, thank you for at least

58:19.220 --> 58:23.940
putting that out there. Would it cost a lot of time and money? Yes. Would it be janky and not

58:23.940 --> 58:30.180
a great emulation? Also, yes. And I do understand all that. It's just, I can't, yeah, I can't not

58:30.180 --> 58:35.460
sit here and go, ah, it's a bummer, but I get it. I wonder though, if there is a possibility

58:35.460 --> 58:40.340
for them, like say that a developer really wanted to like get their game to work with it, if they

58:40.340 --> 58:47.060
could like add a compatibility with that stuff, like if they could just rewrite how it works or

58:47.060 --> 58:52.420
something like that. I would imagine, I would imagine they've already reached out to the top 10

58:52.420 --> 58:59.460
VR game makers and having those conversations. In fact, if you think about it, um, one of the games

58:59.460 --> 59:07.140
that I know is very popular on PSVR is No Man's Sky and Hello Games some time ago announced that

59:07.140 --> 59:13.540
there was going to be a PSVR 2 version before it was confirmed that it's not going to be compatible

59:13.540 --> 59:18.420
with PS because there were some people going, well, yeah, of course there's going to be a VR 2

59:18.420 --> 59:23.780
version. They're just going to take the VR 1 version and push the button differently. But now

59:23.780 --> 59:27.380
now that we've all sat down and critically thought about it, oh wait, no, Hello Games is actually

59:27.380 --> 59:33.460
going and making a PSVR 2 version of No Man's Sky. So, you know, there, I would say look at

59:33.460 --> 59:37.860
the top 10 PlayStation VR games and Sony's probably having conversations and I would bet

59:38.980 --> 59:44.500
dimes to dollars No Man's Sky is one of the top 10 games. So we already knew that's coming. So,

59:45.540 --> 59:50.500
all right. Uh, let's see Zen Monkey 11 in chat says I'm a PlayStation VR owner and I'm happy

59:50.500 --> 59:54.740
it's not backwards compatible. They needed to upgrade that thing. They better have better

59:54.740 --> 59:59.620
lenses this time around. No one talks about how bad the lenses were on the PSVR, my main issue

59:59.620 --> 01:00:05.540
with it. Yeah. So, I mean, you know, the, maybe it's just going to feel smoother, feel better,

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:10.740
you know, um, just as a device. And so maybe we need to leave the past in the past. I don't know.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:17.300
So, all right. Uh, that was the PlayStation State of Play. Let's talk about now the Nintendo Direct

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:23.460
that also happened this week. By the way, neither of these things we knew were happening, although,

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:27.700
you know, with Tokyo Game Show this week, you should have probably anticipated it.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.180
But we did get a Nintendo Direct that happened this week, and there was quite a few announcements

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:38.100
that were made in that as well. Fire Emblem Engage was announced. Fire Emblem is back,

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:43.860
and this is a new game in the series that will be out in January of 2023. It Takes Two,

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:48.820
which I believe was Game of the Year at the Game Awards last year, is now getting a Nintendo Switch

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:53.060
version. So that is coming out on November 4th. But of course, if you want to put down your money

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:58.340
for a pre-order, you can already do that now. Fatal Frame, Mask of the Lunar Eclipse.

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:03.380
This game was originally on the Wii. It was not released outside of Japan, but guess what? You

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:08.660
are getting an English version now in early 2023 on the Switch. And I know, Fatal Frame is

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:14.500
definitely one of those like cult hit series of games. So there's going to be some very specific

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:19.220
people out here that will be very happy with this news. So, um, congrats to the Fatal Frame fans.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:24.420
Uh, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was just confirmed there's new content coming. That really shouldn't

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:29.220
be too much of a surprise, but Eno is coming in the second wave of the expansion pass,

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:33.540
and she has new abilities for the roster. There'll be new challenge battles and so on and so on.

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:39.220
October 13th is the day for all of that. Guess what? If you love SpongeBob SquarePants and who

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:43.060
doesn't love a good SpongeBob SquarePants reaction image, you have a whole new game,

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:47.860
the Cosmic Shake. It's a platformer with seven areas, and it's coming next year.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:51.780
All the original voice actors, uh, will be participating in the game.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:58.820
Uh, if you love Fist of the North Star, you can now play fitness boxing, or at least you will in

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:06.980
March, which is based on Fist of the North Star. It's basically a rhythm game. Wasn't this a game

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:11.140
already? Like, it was back when we did Bamani games.

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.900
I'm thinking of the Punch Mania version.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:16.260
Is it, but was it Fist of the North Star related? The Punch-

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.140
No, but-

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.300
No, there was one that was Fist of the North Star.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:25.460
Yes, because didn't we play it at Arcade Infinity once? Because when I saw this, I was like,

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:29.700
wasn't this at Arcade Infinity, like, years ago? Like, I swear this was a thing.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:36.500
Okay, thank you in chat. Uh, Dartesia says, uh, Hokuto no Ken Punch Mania.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.700
Hokuto no Ken.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.900
Yeah, so-

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.580
Which is Fist of the North Star.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:45.460
That's it. So I, okay, so this is kind of something we've seen before, but it's kind of

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:50.420
neat. Who thought you'd ever see this come back, right? So we're getting a lot of, like,

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:51.860
interesting Japanese revival.

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.060
It is a deep cut.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:03:00.900
It is a deep cut. This is a B side, but it's cool that it's getting the A treatment.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:06.980
Then we had some farming simulators, starting with Oddballers. Oh no, I'm sorry, Oddballers.

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:07.780
No, that's a-

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:12.660
My bad. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Oddballers is multiplayer dodgeball. My list is off here.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.380
Uh, that is coming out early next year.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:19.940
Tunic is coming out on September 22nd. We already knew that game was coming,

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.620
we got a date for it though.

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:27.060
Front Mission 1 and 2. If you're a fan of these, uh, tactical games, uh, that is gonna be coming

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:31.220
out in 2023, and there'll be a third game in the series coming out eventually as well.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.180
Now, Story of Seasons, A Wonderful Life, there you go.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:38.340
Uh, there's your farming sim, uh, because don't you love farming sims?

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:41.460
Don't you want to play Feh Farm? Don't you want to play that as well?

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:48.180
Uh, Octopath Traveler 2. It's coming. It's a thing. It's happening. Eight new,

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:53.060
uh, travelers in this game. Uh, it's going to be, uh, taking place in a similar kind of

01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:58.740
industrial time as the first game. Uh, so yeah, this will be, uh, interesting. It's gonna have

01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:03.620
a time mechanic, which will mean you have different abilities between daytime and nighttime.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:09.460
Uh, and this time, instead of the completely separate stories, traveler stories will intersect

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:13.380
earlier on in the game. February 24th, 2023 is when that's coming out.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:20.580
Honestly, the biggest news for me, uh, and, uh, for anyone with taste, quite frankly,

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:27.700
Theatrhythm, final bar line is coming out. Yay. They are finally doing Theatrhythm on the Switch.

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:32.260
They're also doing it on PlayStation 4 and 5. It just wasn't a part of the direct,

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:38.740
but this makes me very happy. 385 songs from the Final Fantasy series,

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:45.460
and if that's not enough, how about 90 download songs? And if that's not enough, how about 27

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:50.820
additional songs in the digital deluxe edition? Pretty much, if it is a Square Enix song,

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.380
outside of Kingdom Hearts, because you have to play Melody of Mediocrity if you want to play the,

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:58.980
um, Kingdom Hearts songs. I think that's what it was called. At least in my head,

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:03.300
that's what it was called. Um, if you want to play the Kingdom Hearts songs, you got to go over

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:11.540
there. But, like, there's Nier songs in this, Chrono Trigger. I mean, am I going to drop $100

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:18.420
on the digital collector's edition of this? Honestly, probably. Sorry, not sorry, but,

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:25.700
again, we had this discussion earlier in the show. Am I a fanboy for Final Fantasy games? Yes.

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:30.260
Am I going to drop $100 for, like, 500 different songs across Squares?

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:34.020
You can't say that you're not getting your money's worth with 500 songs. Like,

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:37.860
if I said, oh, hey, I'm going to buy a DDR game with 500 songs in it, you'd be like,

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:44.100
damn, that's a good value. Exactly. Exactly. So, I'm excited. I'll be buying it, and I look forward

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:49.220
to playing with Bobby Blackwolf online, and many of you as well. Uh, Mario and Rabbids,

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:52.980
Sparks of Hope. We knew that there was a new Mario and Rabbids game. Now we know it's coming

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:58.500
on October 20th. Uh, Rune Factory 3 Special. If you were a fan of Rune Factory 3 on the DS,

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:03.300
you can have a special time on the Nintendo Switch in 2023.

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:09.060
Some new games announced for the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo Switch online. We will be seeing later

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:18.580
this year, Pilotwings 64 and Mario Party 1 and 2. And then in 2023, Mario Party 3, Pokemon Stadium

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:27.300
1 and 2, 1080 Snowboarding, and Excitebike 64. Oh, and one game that we never thought we would see

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:33.300
added to the service, because licensing is a bitch, but they got it worked out,

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:40.340
Goldeneye 007. That's right. The Nintendo 64 Classic Goldeneye is also coming out.

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:45.460
Now, what was interesting about this, even though they weren't having it direct at the same time,

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:52.020
Microsoft, you know, because of the rare connection, at the exact same time announced,

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:59.140
they are also getting a remastered version of the original Goldeneye on their platform. However,

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:05.540
it will not have online play. This version will because it's already baked into the emulator that

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:10.740
Nintendo put out online, but the one on Xbox, they're trying to focus the conversation on couch

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:16.820
co-op and all this stuff. Regardless, any way you slice it, this game was better in your memory than

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:22.820
it is now. I guarantee it. That game made me so sick I passed out. I'm serious.

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:28.500
And here's the other thing about it that maybe plays into this a little bit. Bobby brought up

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:35.780
a great point on his show. The standard for controlling first-person games now that Halo and

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:41.700
those games have established, this game did not control the same way. So to try to go back and

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:46.820
play a game like this after you've played the Halos, the Dooms, the other first-person games

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:52.500
of the world, it's not easy to go back and play Goldeneye. So again, I just want to remind you all

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:58.180
this game is better in your memory than it is now, but you know what? I bet you're excited anyway.

01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:02.740
Go off, have fun, enjoy this game for the 15 minutes you'll play it before you move on to

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:07.140
something else once it comes out of the Nintendo 64 emulator. But if you're able to recreate that

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:15.300
magic of 1998 in your living room, you know what? Go off, have fun. So by the way, they already

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:21.380
redid Goldeneye on the Nintendo Wii in 2010. Do you remember that? But I think they had to take

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:26.100
out Pierce Brosnan's face and they may have replaced it with Daniel Craig. That was a whole

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:32.900
thing that they did. But does anyone remember they've already did and it didn't sell quite

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.300
because again, Goldeneye is better.

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:40.420
Well, that was Goldeneye Reloaded and it was awful because Activision did it and Activision

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:43.140
like half-assed it. So, you know.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:48.100
We all know that the Goldeneye game was Brosnan's best role as Bond.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:56.420
More games for the Nintendo Direct. Various Daylife, a new RPG for the Switch on from

01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:01.540
Square Enix, and it's out now. I believe this was already out on mobile devices,

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.060
so it's not exactly new.

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:06.820
It's funny. Various Daylife sounds like it would be like a subreddit or something with

01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:09.220
random pictures of people or something.

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.820
It was an Apple Arcade.

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:16.740
That's okay. That's why I thought it was a mobile title first. Actually, funny enough, you do chores.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.740
I didn't get into it. I didn't really like it.

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:24.580
Yeah. You do chores in exchange for job classes. It almost sounds like, what was that level five

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:30.180
game? Actually, that game was super underrated though. It was like something life. Somebody

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.860
will know what I'm talking about in chat. It was a really underground favorite.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:42.100
I think it was the 3DS or the regular DS, and it was a level five game and it never got a sequel.

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.420
Fantasy Life. Thank you. That's what it was.

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:46.980
That was the game I was trying to think of.

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:51.300
Factorio is coming out for Switch on October 28th.

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:58.260
IB is a 2D pixel art horror game coming out in the spring of 2023.

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:04.420
Mario Strikers Battle League. It's a new update for the already released Mario Strikers,

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:08.980
and Pauline and Diddy Kong are joining the roster. You can check that out later this month.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:14.020
Atelier Ryza 3 is coming out as well, because it is Tokyo Game Show,

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:18.340
so why not have some Japanese RPGs? That'll be out on February 24th, 2023.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:25.380
A reminder that there are Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course passes coming.

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:29.700
Merry Mountain and Peach Gardens from DS will be available this holiday,

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:34.580
so that is on its way out. Nintendo Switch Sports is getting golf,

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.500
because we knew they were going to be adding games to that.

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:44.020
Nintendo did a whole spotlight on Pikmin Bloom, which that game's been out, so well,

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:47.460
I know why they did a spotlight, because they need more people to be playing it.

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:53.220
And to be fair, they've made a lot of changes to that game from the first year,

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:58.660
and while I didn't love all the changes, I would say, especially the fact that you can now finally,

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:04.500
this change just went in a week ago, you can buy expansions and things like that with coins,

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:09.460
instead of having to pay the $2.99 to expand that type of stuff. You can now use the free to play

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:14.340
coins, although they're slow to get, but you can get them, to pay for that stuff. So that's a huge

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.900
quality of life change that they made that's a good thing right there. But anyway, they just,

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.420
they need more people playing the game. That's why they did a spotlight on it.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:28.180
I'm surprised that they didn't walk back any pre-COVID changes or COVID changes that they had.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.220
They didn't really make COVID changes to Pikmin Bloom.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:35.300
Oh, they didn't. Well, how nice for Niantic to not do it for that game.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:40.900
Yeah, right. All right. But that all led into a Pikmin 4 announcement. And that's

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:44.180
really all we know. We didn't get a screenshot or nothing. Pikmin 4 is coming.

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:49.140
No, I thought we got, oh no, that's right. It wasn't Pikmin. I thought we had like screenshots.

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:52.900
Oh, I thought it was like a concept thing. I didn't think it was like an actual screenshot.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:55.300
I mean, okay. So maybe we did get a screenshot.

01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:00.740
No, they have like some like test footage or whatever they're talking about. Like you're

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:03.700
going to be able to play the game from like the Pikmin perspective or something like that.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:12.260
But at the same time, why are we getting another Pikmin game? F-Zero. F-Zero. We've already had,

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:16.660
like, we've already had two Pikmin games now in the time that we haven't had F-Zero.

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:23.140
And that is a crime. That is a hate crime. I will be writing my congresspeople tomorrow.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.340
Just Dance 2023. Hello. You knew this game was coming because it's coming everywhere else.

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:35.300
November 22nd is the day. Harvest Ella because you love your farming games. There's a new demo

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:38.740
on the eShop that just came out if you want to check it out. And you can get the full game on

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:44.020
November 4th. You knew we were going to see Bayonetta 3. So it was nice to get a new peak

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:51.060
at that. And October 28th, again, is the day for that. Raincode Master Detective Archives. That is

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:55.860
Danganronpa. The people that made that game are making this game.

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:56.980
Like Jynsoft.

01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:01.300
Yeah. So they are making this. So I'm sure some people will be checking it out based on that

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:07.620
alone. If you want to play Resident Evil, either Village or Biohazard, the seventh game, or the

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:12.420
two or three remakes, if you want to play those on the Switch, guess what? You can. But guess what?

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:17.220
They're cloud versions. So you have to have a constant internet connection for it to work.

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:24.900
But hey, you know what? Some people, they want to have it on their portable device,

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.660
even though they can't leave their house. But OK. It's going to be coming.

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:36.980
Sifu, a kung fu game coming out November 8th. Crisis Core, Final Fantasy VII Reunion.

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:43.220
I'm surprised this was in the Nintendo Direct and not in the PlayStation thing, but OK. December

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:50.900
13th is the day this is coming out. Radiant Silver Gun. That was kind of random and cool to hear.

01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:55.620
That is out on the Switch right now. It was a It's Out Today port announcement.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:56.340
I'm going to go get it now.

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:58.980
I thought you might have already picked it up.

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:02.900
Well, I haven't switched my Switch in a while.

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:08.980
Sorry, I know there's a lot of games. I'm almost done. Endless Dungeon. It takes place in an

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:13.140
abandoned space station. It's a procedurally generated roguelike for four players that's

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:17.860
coming out next year. Tales of Symphonia is getting a remaster. So if you're a Tales of

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:23.060
Fan, you can check that out. Life is Strange. The Arcadia Bay collection is coming to the Switch.

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:29.220
So this is, you know, some of the earlier Life is Strange games all repackaged. Lego Brick Tales.

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.500
You know, it's coming out everywhere. And of course, it's coming out on the Switch as well.

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:39.300
Romancing Saga. The minstrel song remastered. That is coming out on December 1st.

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:45.380
Disney Speedstorm. This game looks particularly interesting after the, you know, somewhat success

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:50.180
of the Disney Dreamlight Valley. This game is coming out on the Switch as well later this year.

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:55.220
The second season of Fall Guys already started. It started on September 15th.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:15:00.980
The Return to Dreamland Deluxe. Kirby's Return to Dreamland Deluxe. It's a remake of the

01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:09.780
2011 Wii game. And this will be out on February 24th, 2023. All right. And then the big finale,

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:16.820
the big climax. Breath of the Wild 2 has a real name now. It is The Legend of Zelda,

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:23.220
Tears of the Kingdom, which some people have pointed out may have been the reason that the

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:28.580
Direct was delayed in Europe because of the passing of the Queen, the Tears of the Kingdom.

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:35.220
I don't know if there is any fact in that, but it is awfully interesting. But anyhow,

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.500
the game is officially called The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. That is the

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:44.740
sequel to Breath of the Wild. There was just a little peek because originally when it first

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:49.060
started playing, I was like, are they doing like a Skyward Sword thing? I was like, oh no,

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:52.260
it's Breath of the Wild. It's just got the Skyward, you know, all that in it. But we know

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:58.100
that's going to be in there with a glider and all that stuff. Also, we got a date May 12th,

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:05.540
2023. So the long, long, long wait for Breath of the Wild 2 or now as we know it Tears of the

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:14.020
Kingdom is almost over. So some thoughts in chat. Dark Tetsuya says, Yeah, that's what I was

01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:19.060
thinking. Maybe a bit too close to home. Oh, interesting. Dark Tetsuya says radiant silver

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:23.940
apparently got pulled. The rating got changed. I don't know if it's back up yet.

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:28.900
That's interesting. So I didn't find it. That might be why it's not there yet. So you might

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:32.980
have to check again in a couple of days. That's interesting. I wonder what happened there. That's

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:41.220
a yikes. So yeah. Well, I'm sure it's coming back. But yeah, that is really random. So

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:45.220
and what would have changed about the rating? It's not like the game

01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:52.420
had an excessive amount. I guess. All right. Anyway, let's move on. More and more stuff out

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:58.580
of Tokyo Game Show, I guess. And even though things leak, sometimes it doesn't stop the

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:02.740
news from coming and having the officialness behind it. But Dark Soccer, what do you got?

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:11.620
So I have, well, number one, I have been a big Street Fighter fan for a very long time,

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:20.020
and they have leaked the full roster, the launch day roster for Street Fighter 6. And that's more

01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:28.020
than what they just have on their character page on the website. So the leaked list starts with

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:42.260
Aki or AKI, Akuma or Goki, Blanca, Kami, DJ, Dhalsim, Honda, Ed, JP, Judy, Ken, Kimberly.

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:48.740
Kimberly is cool. Okay, she's supposed to like, be like, I guess, guys version of Sakura.

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:50.100
Oh, neat.

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:59.700
Bushin Ryu fangirl. There's Lily, Marisa, Mimi, Rashid, and Zangief. And they've already

01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:06.900
shown gameplay of Kami wearing her classic costumes. So the theory is that the classic

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:11.700
costumes are going to be in there. I'm going to our chat for some reactions,

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:14.980
because people have opinions on Street Fighter 6. I do too. I think it looks great.

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:21.860
Um, apart from how it looks, though, the control on it is it's kind of a weird fight system.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:25.860
Interesting. I think a lot of the classic players aren't really going to care for it.

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:32.900
But I don't know. I don't know. It's just it's very simplified.

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:37.460
It's piquing my interest in a way five never did. So I'm curious.

01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:43.140
I still think that Street Fighter 4 was up there with probably the pinnacle next to Alpha 2.

01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:50.260
Oh, I love 4. 4 is yeah, I love 4. Going to chat twitch.tv slash vog network. Mike Deff says

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:54.740
Street Fighter 6 looks so good like leagues better than Street Fighter 5 did at launch. Yeah,

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:57.540
hard agree on that to be honest. Like all the color splashes,

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:05.380
though. I think that that that just is too overwhelming. But but yeah, and and dark test,

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:09.780
like dark Tetsuya said there is a closed beta. I've been lined up for it for a little bit.

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:19.460
Um, but it's gonna it lists the systems that will be available. So that's PS5, Xbox and Steam.

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:26.260
Sorry, Nintendo Switch fans, but it just can't unless they do a cloud version,

01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:34.340
it probably just can't run six as well as the others can. All right. Well, let's move on.

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:41.060
Loki. Yeah, so apparently, the Sims 4 is going to be going free to play.

01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:46.660
Which makes sense because they have so many expansions for it, they'd probably want to have

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:50.820
the base game available for free. So people can get hooked and buy all the expansions.

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:58.020
So that is going to be the case. It says Sims 4 will be free to download

01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:01.460
across PC, Mac and consoles, October 18.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:08.980
I love what Jason said in tonight's intro about this. He said it so well. He said,

01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:14.500
EA has finally discovered the shareware system of the 1990s. And that it worked

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:20.740
that they give you the base for free. And then, like, you know, $1,000. There's a ton of DLC,

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:25.940
this game. There is so much and my son was addicted to he's not addicted to but he likes

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:29.620
playing the game. So he does spend like his steam money usually is going to

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:36.900
buying expansions for this game. Like he has a ton of the Sims 4 expansions. So it's

01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:41.620
it's funny. And I've said this on the show before is I really think Dead by Daylight ought to do

01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:46.820
the same thing. But if you think about it, like, they kind of keep giving away based dead by

01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:54.500
daylight a lot, like whether it's you know, an epic game store giveaway or in Microsoft game pass,

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:59.540
you know, depending on if you consider that free or not. I think it was a Sony games. I almost

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:03.540
said games with gold. That's not what they call it. PlayStation Plus, I think I think I have an

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:08.020
epic. Yeah, it was when it launched an epic store. They gave it away for free that week. So like,

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:10.740
Dead by Daylight is one of those games where I also think they ought to just give away the

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:14.420
base game for free because you know, they're making their money off battle passes and DLC.

01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:21.380
But they kind of think it's it's pretty easy to get for free if you just pay attention,

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:24.580
you know, and follow, you know, those discount Twitters and stuff.

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:31.220
By the way, about Sims 4, I still have a lot of my mods from the Sims resource.

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.460
If your son wants them.

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:37.380
Well, I was actually kind of curious on your take Dark Sakura because you know,

01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:41.380
some of the longtime listeners of the program remember you being quite the Sims fan,

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:45.220
as Joan Hunter-Matton chat says, I remember the early years of the show about Jamie modding the

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:49.860
hell out of Sims. So I'm kind of curious, is this something I mean, is have you just kind of

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:51.620
kind of gone past this franchise or?

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.780
I got bored and I got tired of paying for different things.

01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:03.540
I'll be honest, I mean, I never really actually played the game, I would just build houses

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:07.780
and make them as funky as I could. And then I would be bored.

01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:08.280
Yeah.

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:15.540
I it was all just like the building element for me, you know, designing doing my character creation

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:23.380
and my old PC would be like, how many more mods are you going to stuff in this game before I die?

01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:25.060
And there's there's.

01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.340
Oh, watch.

01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:31.700
There's nothing wrong with deciding that, oh, OK, I'm kind of done with this game series for now.

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:37.380
I'm into this thing now. You know, friendship ended with Sims. Now Dead by Daylight is my

01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.180
new best friend. It's just it's OK.

01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:45.620
I would go back to like I went to Sims for a bit after it came out

01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:55.700
and like I would make different Sims for people, you know, and I don't know, I just I got meh.

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:57.160
Yeah.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:03.860
And like then I was like my other thing I would do in that game was like, look for real buildings

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:09.220
and try to recreate them, like, you know, like carriage houses, because I used to have this

01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:15.620
dream that I would live in a carriage house. And so I made it in the Sims and then I make like

01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:21.620
underground labyrinthine, you know, secret laboratories and shit and torture dungeons.

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:23.160
All right.

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:24.200
Yeah.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.000
All right.

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:25.880
Alas.

01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:29.700
I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next story because we are running a little long tonight,

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:33.700
so I'm going to do this one quickly because Loki kind of already talked about it,

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:38.180
but that's OK. I just want to mention quickly that they did confirm that Like a Dragon Eight

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:42.580
is coming out, and this is essentially for all intents and purposes Yakuza eight.

01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:46.340
Let me talk about the difference in a moment. I'm sure some of you are already typing it in chat.

01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:52.580
I will mention it in a moment. RGG Studio did a special presentation as part of Tokyo Game Show,

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:57.700
and they put out a teaser trailer and they did confirm the sequel is coming in 2024

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:05.860
on PlayStation, Xbox and PC. Kazuma Kiryu and Ichiban Kasuga are both in a dual protagonist

01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:10.980
role in this game, with Kazuma supporting a Silver Fox hairstyle that will be explained in

01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:16.740
the storyline as part of it. They referred to the game as an RPG, but outside of that, we don't know,

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:22.180
you know, specifically the gameplay style. They are saying it is the largest scale Yakuza or Like

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:28.420
a Dragon title to date. It will be available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so it is scale downable

01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:33.300
for whatever that is worth. Also during the showcase, they did announce Like a Dragon

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:37.700
Isshin and Like a Dragon Gaiden, the man who erased his name. Both those games are coming

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:45.380
as well. So why is this Like a Dragon eight and not Yakuza eight? Well, it's basically because

01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:53.380
Yakuza Like a Dragon was kind of like, ironically, also the seventh game in the series was kind of

01:24:53.380 --> 01:25:00.180
like Resident Evil Biohazard. Like a Dragon is sort of what the series has been called in Japan

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:05.700
for years, not literally, but that's roughly what it translates to. But when they released the games

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:10.820
over here in the States, they gave it a new name to kind of fit in with a lot of the competing games

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:15.060
that were coming out at the time. They wanted it to have like the whole Japanese crime drama stuff,

01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:21.620
so they called it Yakuza. And so that all happened that way. But now with Like a Dragon eight,

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:26.100
they are going to bring it in parody, basically. And so now, and I think this probably is going to

01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:31.540
have to do with the style of the game changing as well. If they're talking about the RPG and

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:38.260
everything I had heard before, I thought they were going to keep the Like a Dragon seven stuff in it.

01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:43.060
I hope they do because I far prefer that to the fighting game style of the earlier games. But

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:51.140
that's it. Yep, they're going to just closely align that with the Japanese name. So I'm very

01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:56.180
curious to see more about Like a Dragon eight. And I'm sure people want to know,

01:25:56.180 --> 01:26:04.740
am I going to finish Like a Dragon seven? We'll see. We'll see. I'm kind of,

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:10.260
friendship ended with Like a Dragon. Now Assassin's Creed Odyssey is my new best friend.

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:20.900
For now, I'm sure it'll change next week as it always does. All right. Moving on, Dark Sakura.

01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:26.740
So, you know, I'm actually still wondering when I'm going to get my Dead by Daylight board game,

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:33.460
but it's not the only video game getting board games. Team Forged Games is doing

01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:40.980
an Elden Ring board game. So it'll have miniatures of the game's enemies, the bosses,

01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:53.700
Margit the Fel Omen. Sorry. But it will basically let one to four quote,

01:26:53.700 --> 01:27:04.100
tarnished players go through their adventures on the board game. And a quote is that it's,

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:08.020
the game, the video games characteristically challenging fights will be recreated by

01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:13.860
intelligent dice-free combat, requiring players to strategize and adapt their plans during each

01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:20.580
encounter, whether that be a lowly Godric soldier or the Grafted King himself. I don't know what

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:30.900
they mean by dice-free, so maybe it'll use cards, but the Kickstarter. But the Kickstarter page

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:35.940
doesn't even have a date on it. It's just the Elden Ring board game. I'll link it in chat,

01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:40.820
but it's just like, hi, we're doing this thing at some point.

01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:46.020
Popular video games often get board games, but it's, I mean, that's not to say they're lesser

01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:50.900
than or bad. You know, like I have some friends that love the Civ board game. Civilization has

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:56.100
a board game. They love it. So yeah, just pencil. I'd be curious to check out the Dead by Daylight

01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:01.380
one when you get yours. I need to follow up on that. I don't know. I haven't heard anything

01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:03.860
since I confirmed all my stuff for it. Interesting.

01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:07.700
All right. Let's move on to some bummer news, Loki.

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:16.100
Yeah, we have more layoffs. So Fanbyte, which is a Tencent-owned gaming site, I guess,

01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:23.460
they have fired staff without warning. And apparently according to a Fanbyte employee,

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:32.980
the layoffs were total shock. And some of those, some that had just been laid off, had been only

01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:40.820
given like an hour notice. And also they said that I don't know the total number of employees

01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:46.340
that were laid off there, but there were at least several mentioned that had lost their jobs.

01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:51.220
It was most of the staff. It sounds like they're keeping people that do the evergreen content,

01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:54.660
like strategy guides and stuff like that. And that's probably where they're going to

01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:59.060
try to get their hits. But it sounds like the news part of it is, from what I'm gathering,

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:04.420
I have a Twitter buddy who was impacted with this and it's a bummer to hear about.

01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:15.140
Yeah. And then was it G4 TV also laid off 20 to 30 staff members as well. Now this doesn't

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:19.140
mean that they're going to be cutting down on content. They're going to still be producing the

01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:25.060
same slate of content. It's just, they said this was due to unforeseen, well, I'm sorry,

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:30.660
this was due to their growing, I guess. They said it ebbs and flows something to that.

01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:32.260
They're growing so they have to cut back.

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:34.900
Yeah. I don't understand how that works.

01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:40.420
The Comcast board isn't making enough money, so we have to get it from somewhere.

01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:48.740
I don't know. Like I haven't really been following G4 to be honest. I know that sounds

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:53.700
harsh. I know people that are there too. I'm sorry. Again, it's not a reflection on anyone

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:56.660
or anything personally, but it is one of those things where it's like, I just think

01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:05.620
a TV channel like that now, the world in 2022 is not what it was in 2000. What was the merger of

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:12.260
tech TVs, 2006 or something like that? It's not the same world. It's pre-YouTube, pre-Twitch.

01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:15.620
Like it's a different world we live in now.

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:20.980
You know, and it was, yeah, it was just back then it was easier to see it because

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:26.660
it was like having an exclusive YouTube channel, a single YouTube channel that basically gave you

01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:30.900
your gaming news. And so, yeah, it was super popular because there wasn't really anything

01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:36.660
out there like that outside of like gaming magazines. But nowadays with the internet,

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:41.140
anybody out there, there's so many outlets, anybody could give you the gaming news.

01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:46.260
G4, isn't G4 also kind of a pain in the ass to watch? Like you have to have the special

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:52.340
Xfinity internet channel box or something to get it. Like I know some content is online,

01:30:52.340 --> 01:31:02.500
but it almost feels like it's hard to get a hold of anyway. I don't know. But honestly,

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:06.180
I'm not really looking for it except for some of the viral moments, which actually,

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:13.220
and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, there are a lot of the internet that blames it on the one

01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:18.740
rant the woman made about misogyny in quotes. Well, when you insult your audience, then expect

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:27.620
to get laid off. In the words of the wonderful Gordon Ramsey, oh, fuck off. Like just shut up,

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:31.060
Twitter. You do not know what the fuck you're talking about because number one,

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:38.900
did she get laid off? I don't think so. And number two, that was actually the moment that

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:45.940
made me go, oh, I should be paying attention to this over here. G4 probably needs more viral

01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:54.260
moments like that to be quite honest. So armchair critics who can't stand hearing the truth,

01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:56.660
if you can't stand hearing the truth,

01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:05.540
just don't. Yeah. It's just, it's a hard sell nowadays, especially with cable stuff. Like most

01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:11.300
people are cutting cable and even just still like scream, scream into the void of your three actual

01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:17.620
followers and your 45 Russia bots. God, like, like I've got like Comcast cable. I don't have their

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:22.340
box obviously. Cause why would I pay extra for their stupid box? Um, so there's like, yeah,

01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:28.180
I don't even know how we'd watch their content outside of what I see like on Twitter. Um,

01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:33.460
and even then I'm like, not really motivated to watch any of it. Like I used to love G4, but like,

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:37.940
yeah, I used to, that was a long time ago. Now there's other things I like watching.

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:44.420
So it's hard. Zen monkey 11 in chat. Sorry. I just want to Zen monkey 11 and chat says

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:49.940
G4 viewers since relaunch. Uh, they are on Twitch, YouTube, Pluto TV. They're on everything.

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:55.380
You can watch Pluto and watch. They do the shows live on Twitch and YouTube.

01:32:55.380 --> 01:33:00.980
Uh, and then tiger class says it's on YouTube TV and Pluto TV has a channel called G4 TV select.

01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:06.340
See, but that's like, I have to be honest. Like it sounds like it's completely different on YouTube,

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:12.260
Twitch, maybe those are the same thing, but then we have G4 TV select. So that sounds different

01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:16.180
than, than the actual station like that. Like, look, and I'm not, again, I'm not knocking it.

01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:20.020
I'm not knocking the fans, but I'm just saying that's a little confusing.

01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:26.020
Then G4 TV. Is that like live TV or is that just like replaying the old shows?

01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:30.820
It sounds like replaying the old shows, but do I really know? I don't know. Uh,

01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:34.740
Bobby black Wolf and chat says my mom's house has it. And I turned it on once attack of the

01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:39.140
show was on and it looked like a podcast being recorded. Three people sitting around mics and

01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:49.780
laptops. Well, now who would watch that? But to be fair, I think a lot of pandemic stuff

01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:54.020
kind of changed that, but grant, I get it's 2022. And you know, a lot of that stuff's about.

01:33:55.300 --> 01:34:00.820
Wasn't the show that they had, um, didn't they have a show with, um, Scott Rubin

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:05.780
that was three people around microphones or something like that. Wasn't like the G4 TV.

01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:11.060
I don't remember what it was called, but they were all in the same room.

01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.500
Remember when it was cool to do that?

01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:16.100
Oh, it's all remote now still. Right.

01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:20.100
I think, well, I don't think there is a G4 TV show anymore.

01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:26.900
Bobby black was talking about attack of the show, which was the, essentially the spinoff of, um,

01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:32.020
thank you. Screen savers. I was like Leo, the poor tech TV. Yeah. That one,

01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:36.500
not, not the other one, which that, that other show that Scott was on with the, um,

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:40.340
the gals that went to go work at Microsoft, uh, that that show has been long gone.

01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:44.500
I miss this. I mean, I don't miss the screen savers. Cause I know that, that I think that

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:48.740
still exists or maybe it doesn't exist. They, they had it a new, the new screensavers at one time,

01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:54.260
but I don't watch that anymore. But, um, man, I miss the old screen savers though,

01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:59.620
that that was some good TV. Uh, Zen monkey 11 says, think of it like big brother.

01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:03.140
You have the live feeds with all the cool content like Twitch and YouTube.

01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:07.940
And then you have the CBS show Comcast. That's actually actually Zen monkey to give you credit.

01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:13.380
That's a great way of putting it. And maybe that's the kind of approach G4 needs to take

01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:16.180
and marketing it. So I'm not saying they have to literally compare themselves to big brother,

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:21.540
but maybe, you know, the uncensored stuff is online. I don't know. Or maybe they're doing it.

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:25.540
And I'm just not, I'm too old to be the target marketing demographic. And I've never seen these

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:30.180
ads. I don't know, but I'm just, just thinking this landscape, I'm not going to be surprised

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:37.860
that they fold in three years. Like honestly, like it's hard, you know, like, um, I don't know,

01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:43.380
but like, I would not be surprised if that happens because it's just, it's like trying to keep a

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:49.380
gaming magazine up in this day and age. It's just, you can't, you can't compete with it.

01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:54.580
And I'm sorry, like, like their, their personalities are great. Like I love,

01:35:54.580 --> 01:36:00.820
you know, Adam, um, what was it? Uh, I love Adam. What's his name? Sessler.

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:06.260
Sessler. Yes. Sorry. I had all these other names. I'm like, it's, it's not Sandler. Don't say

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:14.180
Sandler. I know it's not a Sandler. Like I can see his face. Um, yeah. Adam Sussler. Um, you know,

01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:20.820
I just, I don't know. Like, like I was fine with it being gone and just like keeping up with him

01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:25.460
on Twitter and stuff instead. Like I just don't need it to come back. But like, I mean,

01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:30.420
it has its fans, you know, Zen monkey saying it's been around like three years. They're good. People

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:34.100
don't just didn't know cause they weren't on cable. So they need cable in a way at

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:42.740
that part. I disagree with, there are cable is a dying brand. So this is why I would say it's good

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:49.300
that G4 has a presence on places like Pluto TV, streaming things like, like YouTube and Twitch

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:55.620
and so forth. Cable television is about to be a thing of the past. And once 5g is more widely

01:36:55.620 --> 01:37:01.460
available, that's going to be the death knell for cable. So that is where G4 is doing the right

01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:06.740
thing by being on these other places as well for when cable inevitably dies. It's going to.

01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:12.180
So, you know, just wait. All right. Anyhow, we got to move on with the show. Uh, I don't want to,

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:14.820
I don't want to be here all night, but you know, I'm finding here a little bit of the night,

01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:19.700
but I want to talk about the sweet code and HD remaster, which came a little bit out of left

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:24.500
field. I don't think people were really expecting this. Uh, Konami put on a show at Tokyo game show.

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:29.620
They talked about a beloved series, uh, worldwide coming back and many people assumed it was going

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:36.340
to be silent Hill. Although I sure didn't, but I did think Konami would say it was something else.

01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:41.140
I'd be like, Oh, it's gyrus come in, which I do love gyrus, but I thought that was what they

01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:44.500
were going to do is like, Oh, it's like, or Contra or something that they've already tried to relaunch

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:49.060
and relatively recently, I actually think it's pretty cool. They are bringing back sweet code.

01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:53.220
And it's not just sweet code. What the whole, they started just talking about sweet code one.

01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:57.300
And then it was like, Oh, but it's sweet code and two as well. So it's a sweet code and one and two

01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:04.580
HD remaster it's coming out for PlayStation four X-Box one switch and PC in 2023. A lot of people

01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:10.180
have aptly noticed. Wow. Right around the time I had in Chronicles is also set to release. Isn't

01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:16.980
that interesting? Um, so, you know, we've seen some of the, uh, we've seen a trailer,

01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:21.860
we've seen that there's graphical improvements. There's new like lighting cloud, shadow animation,

01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:25.860
new character drawings, sound improvements. They're saying game system improvements and

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:32.260
so on and so on. This is all fine and good. I I'm very happy to see sweet code and getting love

01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:36.980
because this series has needed love for a long time. It's a real bummer that Konami kind of let

01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:44.260
it die off. Like they did just about everything else because Konami sucks. That is also why I'm

01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:51.300
concerned is that in all of this announcement and hype and stuff, I didn't see any other logos.

01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:58.900
And what that means is I didn't see digital clips and two or any of these other companies who are

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:03.780
using Inti creates or these companies that are kind of used to taking older games and making

01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:10.020
them HD. None of that. So this appears to be a Konami in-house production.

01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:24.900
Now I'm going to hit, someone hit the lever, this wrong lever show time. Now look,

01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:31.860
the Suikoden fans, and there are many out there and they are passionate, are quick to say that

01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:38.420
the trailer looks good and I'm sure everything will be fine. Look, I'm rooting for this game.

01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:42.980
I really am. Believe me, no one wants to see this game succeed more than me. Okay,

01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:46.660
maybe a lot of people want to see this game succeed as much as me, but I really do want

01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:54.820
this to be good. However, if I have concerns that the company behind the the notorious game

01:39:54.820 --> 01:40:02.660
E-Football is doing this HD remaster, I have every fucking right to be concerned about this

01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:09.300
game. The Secret of Mana HD remaster looked really cool at first as well. They did an HD

01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:15.380
port of Final Fantasy 6 for mobile devices before the pixel remasters. And do you remember the,

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:22.820
they were bad, but they looked all right in the trailer. So look, I'm just saying I'm going to

01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:29.300
need to see some reviews, some serious gameplay. I'm going to need to see a little more about what

01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:34.740
this game actually looks like before I really get excited because the fact that Konami is developing

01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:43.300
it in-house, yeah, sorry. It's a red flag for me at this point. Especially considering that even

01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:51.940
like more polished studios like Rockstar Games, for example, some of the stuff that they've

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:59.140
remastered hasn't turned out well because of the quality of employees that they put in that,

01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:03.460
or your companies that they hired to do that. So Christ, I don't know, Konami in-house.

01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:08.980
Orange right hit the nail on the fucking head. I can't even believe I didn't think of this one.

01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:16.820
The most obvious Konami HD remaster to raise every red flag you own. I was looking forward

01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:27.300
to the Silent Hill HD remaster and then it happened. I mean, case point, the prostitution

01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:40.900
rests. That's it. Anyway, so yes, I have concerns. I hope I'm wrong. I really do. I hope Konami paid

01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:46.180
somebody a lot of money to secretly help them. I really do. They don't have a lot of money to pay

01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:54.500
anybody. And that's my concerns. All right. Anyway, let's go back maybe to a simpler time

01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:59.540
in our next segment. You know, back in a time like when Konami actually made good games.

01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:02.340
So long ago.

01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:15.780
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:20.660
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:27.460
But once a month Dark Sakura says I'm doing a handheld, not a game. So what's the handheld Dark

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:40.740
Sakura? They're games. I mean, yeah. Anyway, we are doing the series, the Tomitronic 3D. They

01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:49.860
kind of look like view masters, but longer and more spaceship sort of. And they have a light

01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:55.700
panel on top. Well, just like a translucent panel on top that lets light come in and illuminates the

01:42:55.700 --> 01:43:03.460
screen. And there were seven games released. There was, and they had different names. So we had

01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:13.700
Sky Fighters, also known as Dog Fight and Tandy Sky Duel. We had Thundering Turbo, also known as

01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:22.900
Cosmos LeMans Turbo Racer and Thundering Turbos. Sky Attack, AKA Tank Attack. Shark Attack or Jaws

01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:30.580
3D. Planet Zeon, AKA Space Laser War, Space Attack. Then Jungle Fighter and Sherman Attack.

01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:42.420
The names really varied on their regions. But basically the game was just built right into

01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:51.060
the system. It was actually a fairly decent mock-up of 3D the way that they had it set up.

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:58.260
In fact, I think that the one we're looking at right now is one of the turbo ones. And I think

01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:05.140
that it looked pretty good for its time. Here's the Tank Attack. I think I have another one of

01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:15.300
the variation for the Sky Attack. But I think that the games, for when they came out, it was

01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:25.060
as close to actual VR as we were going to get. And it was, in 1983, this was the first dedicated home

01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:38.340
3D hardware. So it used twin LCD monitors. And I mean, for 1983, it was something else.

01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:43.860
It was something else. And you can see that probably some of the influence of this came from

01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:50.100
a lot of the different sci-fi around the time. Like Tron had come out around then.

01:44:50.660 --> 01:45:00.980
So, but I don't know. I think it's something that people need to remember that without this,

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:08.420
where would we have our Wipeout and our other games like that.

01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:16.580
Yeah, stuff like this was like the shit in the early 80s. It was so cool. If you had one of

01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:22.660
these, I don't remember this one particularly, but obviously there are several electronic

01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:30.500
handhelds in a similar vein, we'll say, from in the 80s. And even now I'm looking at the ones that

01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:34.020
have the Tron aesthetic to it that you were just talking about, we were just seeing in the video.

01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:38.580
And I'm like, that game looks cool. I would have been the coolest kid in school if I had

01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:43.860
that in the 80s and brought that to school. It really does give you the sense of depth

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:53.860
and motion, even though it's, and the light is all coming from outside, just linking on the

01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:58.020
screen. I was reading that people would come and put their hands over it and then you couldn't see

01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:10.980
the game. But I mean, there it is, the Tommytronic 3D from 1983. And I made the video myself,

01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:14.420
you're welcome. There you go. So for those watching on Twitch tonight with the video,

01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:18.260
or if you're in the archives, which are subscribers, it is September after all,

01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:23.140
so I should give a shout out for our subscribers over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork. You can go

01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:27.620
back and watch an old episode anytime if you want. If you want to see the video or what have you,

01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:36.260
that's available as a bonus to subscribers in our archive. And Amazon Twitch is currently having a

01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:41.300
sale on subscriptions for September. So now is as good of a time as any to get on that.

01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:45.940
And if you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you already get one free subscription a month. So

01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:50.420
if you're not already using that to help your favorite indie creator, why don't you consider

01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:59.140
using it over at Vognetwork? For the record, I remember hearing of someone who took a little

01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:04.180
flashlight and taped it on top of their thing so they could play at night under the covers.

01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:12.100
Oh, the systems we had when we were kids to play things. Same thing with the original Game Boy.

01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:16.660
It's like remember, remember the original Game Boy did not have any type of backlight or anything

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:21.460
like that. But they actually sold like those screen magnifiers with a shitty little light

01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:26.260
that you could like clip onto the top of the DS. And all it did was make glare. I used to just

01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:32.020
sneak into the bathroom and play at night. That's great. Or the snake light says orange,

01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:36.820
right? Oh, yeah. God, those are terrible. But we did what we did what we had to do.

01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:41.540
Well, you know, my my GBA had we finally put the afterburner in it.

01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:47.780
Because mine was the clear pink one, which I just got for, you know, being a little, you know,

01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:55.300
ironic. It made my whole system glow. I love those Game Boy advances with the afterburners in them

01:47:55.300 --> 01:48:03.460
looked so good. So good. Yeah. Yeah, I think that Tim did all of our our friend Tim did all of our

01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:09.300
upgrades for our GBAs. I had a different friend who I haven't talked to in a very,

01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:12.900
very long time. Unfortunately, he used to hang out in the earlier days, OLR. But just, you know,

01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:16.500
if we grew apart or whatever, who did mine? I think it was like a birthday present at one point.

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:24.660
So, yeah. All right. Anyhow, let's travel around and check out some other news going on in the

01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:31.620
industry. Some rapid fire news. Loki will start with the US. I'm sorry, not my eyes were on world

01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:35.300
release dates. We can start with some news from the US too, though, if you want. I don't know

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:37.220
where this news is from. But once you get to it,

01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:43.780
well, it's it's gonna be or not. I mean, so in this case, I guess it's sort of from the US

01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:51.780
because it's about the Xbox Game Pass. So Deathloop it's been almost a year now. You know

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:57.940
what that means? Exclusive contract is up with Sony. So now it's coming to Xbox Game Pass on

01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:03.140
September 20th. And it's also going to have a new content update called Golden Loop, which comes out

01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:10.740
the same day, adding new abilities and extended ending and secrets. And also, Deathloop will be

01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:18.820
getting added to PlayStation Plus Extra as well. Yeah, so that's cool. I'll have to check it out

01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:25.460
when it comes out. And then this is kind of funny. I actually saw a clip of this on Twitter.

01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:32.980
It's Rose and Camellia. It is a game about slapping, or it's ladies slapping each other.

01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:39.860
And it's Japanese only. With gloves. Well, some of them have gloves. I think most of them have

01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:45.540
gloves. Gloves slap, baby gloves slap. Anyone? Remember when the Simpsons was good? Anyone?

01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:52.260
All right. So it was a game. It's been out for a long time. I think

01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:58.980
it's been, it's a Japanese game. So it is only coming out on the Switch there,

01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:05.220
but it's hilarious because you use the Switch Joy-Cons to actually do the motion control for

01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:10.020
the slap, which is hilarious. That's why I wanted to mention it. All right.

01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:14.900
Dark Sakura, please don't slap me with a glove while you do your rapid fire story.

01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:22.900
Well, there is a Gran Turismo movie with David Harbour being produced and Orlando

01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:34.020
Bloom has joined the cast. So that's really it. Although he's also, his character is going to be

01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:41.220
a marketing executive who loves motor sports and Harbour is playing a retired driver who teaches

01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:49.380
a young person to be a race car driver. I also have another little thing real quick.

01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:56.820
Yeah, sure. Someone put out a mod for Mass Effect 2 called the Nos Astra

01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:05.540
a Nos Astra mineral exchange that lets you actually have a stock market for your mined goods

01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:12.180
created by Team Pyjak and Bekatoria. It's on Nexus.

01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:14.580
All right. It's for the legendary edition.

01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:20.820
All right. All right. Well, I don't know why I'm talking about this in rapid fire news,

01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:25.540
because this is right up your alley, Dark Sakura. I'm sorry. This thing has your name

01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:30.100
all over it. Oh, I've already known about it and linked it to Dan.

01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:35.540
So for everybody else, here's what I'm talking about. It is yet another

01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:40.900
console mini coming out, but what obscure shit are they going to do next?

01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:48.980
Obscure here. Yes, obscure here. Key point. But in Japan, after all, it is Tokyo Game Show week,

01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:58.020
they have announced that the X68000 is going to be getting a mini. It's the X68000Z. It's about

01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:00.900
two-fifths the scale of the original machine. And this is a machine-

01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:02.020
This is a Suzuki.

01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:07.460
Yeah. And it never came out here in the States, as we've referenced before. And not only is there

01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:15.140
the small model there, you can even get a mouse and keyboard for it. Yeah, exactly. This is a

01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:24.180
system that came out in Japan in March of 1987. This was the home of some arcade perfect ports

01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:30.340
like Parodius, Final Fight, Ghouls and Ghosts, Castlevania Chronicles. This was the original

01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:35.060
platform for that. There was a remake of Castlevania on the NES with updated visuals.

01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:40.020
They did put it on the PlayStation later, but still, it was really cool that this is out there.

01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:49.300
So yeah, this is awesome. Again, for the US, extremely niche thing, but for those in the know,

01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:51.780
very cool. Very cool.

01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:55.140
And it looks like it's coming out on the 8th.

01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:58.820
Yeah, it's coming out really soon, all things considered.

01:52:58.820 --> 01:52:59.220
Yeah.

01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:00.740
I like how it has a clarion handle.

01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:04.020
Oh, because the original did.

01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:05.860
Yeah. This is awesome.

01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:08.180
I need-

01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:12.580
I know. I kind of want it too, even though I wish-

01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:14.500
We need someone to order it for us.

01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:21.780
We need a collective sugar daddy or mommy or person.

01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:25.540
I'm trying to see how much it's going to be because I don't know that it's going to be

01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:28.180
super... Okay, there we go.

01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:31.860
Well, it would depend if you get the keyboard, mouse and all the bells and whistles.

01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:37.620
I'm looking at the limited edition to see what the price isn't anywhere on the blog.

01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:39.940
I don't think that's a mouse. I think that's a trackball.

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:40.900
It is.

01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:42.260
Oh, my bad.

01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:48.820
Sorry, they used the mouse emoji and that's what it translated to, so that's what I read. Sorry,

01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:49.460
but yeah.

01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:50.500
It looks like a trackball.

01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.580
Yeah, it's a really oddly shaped mouse.

01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:53.060
Yeah.

01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:57.380
The price isn't on here. Hold on. Let me look at the tweet real quick.

01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:02.740
Well, let me just read some comments over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:05.860
Dark Tetsuya says, this is cool. I want one. Fingers crossed-

01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:07.300
That's the announcement date, by the way.

01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:10.180
Fingers crossed the version of Castlevania comes with it.

01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:11.700
Orange-

01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:17.060
Just from the tweet, it says, details will be announced on 10.8 and reservations will

01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:17.940
start on the same day.

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:22.660
Oh, okay. So that's just the... That's an announcement of an announcement. All right.

01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:27.780
Orange Right says, I saw this on Retro Pals, had a lot of great Capcom arcade ports,

01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:28.580
among other things.

01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:34.900
DJ Rama S says, River City Ransom was on it too. Yeah, so what a fitting tribute.

01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:35.400
Yeah.

01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:39.540
The Nikketsu Downtown fight.

01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:44.020
Yeah, the original name, of course. All right, let's move on. And now we can do some world

01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:47.140
release dates. And now we'll start with the US Loki.

01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:53.540
Yeah, so very exciting week. We're starting off with Return to Monkey Island on PC and

01:54:53.540 --> 01:55:00.900
Nintendo Switch. I will definitely be picking that up. There is no light on PC.

01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:01.860
There are four lights.

01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:03.640
Nevermind.

01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:05.400
Stop it with your Star Trek references.

01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:05.900
I got it.

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:31.720
I don't know why they have the Japanese title in there as well.

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:36.280

01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:59.720
there, because in Japan, Taeko no Tatsujin Rhythm Festival is coming out on the Switch,

01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:02.680
much to a Mike Deff's delight, although I don't know if he imports those things.

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:05.720
The Dial Field Chronicle is out.

01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:10.680
It's an English release, but it is available on the Switch in Japan, a local release.

01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:14.840
Valise, The Phantasm Soldier Collection 2, also out on the Switch.

01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:22.200
Loki already mentioned it, but that Jayuzenge and Getsusangokuden 1 and 2 is out in a regular

and limited edition on the Switch this week in Japan.

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:32.200
It's not translated, but it is still being released in Japan this week as well as Potion

01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:36.840
Permit and Valise, The Phantasm Soldier Collection 2.

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:37.720
Why is this listed twice?

01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:39.240
Oh, because there's a regular limited edition.

01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:40.200
That was the limited edition.

01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:40.600
My bad.

01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:42.920
Let's see.

01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:48.920

01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:05.480
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:08.120
So, of course, a handful.

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:14.680
On the 20th, we have Stray for PlayStation, Thuls Deluxe Edition.

01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:21.160
They misspelled edition, I think, for PlayStation and Xbox.

01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:24.280
And for the same, we also have Construction Simulator.

01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:30.200

And then for the three, we have Dragons Legends of the Nine Realms.

01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:54.300
All right.

01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:59.800
We just have a few more stories for you, and then we'll open up the listener roundtable

01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:04.920

You can join our Discord server and continue the conversation throughout the week over,

02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:16.040
excuse me, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:29.640
That's what I get for drinking coke during the show.

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:33.320
All right, let's move on with a few more stories.

02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:33.820
Loki.

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:42.600
Yes, so I hate to tell you this, all you Babylon's Fall fans out there, but they're

02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:43.800
shutting the game down.

02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:47.080
So the servers are gonna be shut off February 2023.

02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:50.680
Apparently, the game was not all that popular.

02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:59.480
And it says, today we've revealed new information about version 1.0 and the future of Babylon

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:00.840
development.

02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:08.440
After the service ends Monday, February 27th, 2023, 11pm Pacific time, you'll no longer

02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:09.320
be able to play the game.

02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:14.680
All gameplay data on the game servers will be deleted following the termination of the

02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:15.400
service.

02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:17.000
It was a $60 game.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.200
It lasted less than a year.

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:21.960
Live services, the future of gaming.

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.240
But up, up, up, up, up.

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:29.240
I was gonna say, what went wrong with Babylon's Fall?

02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:30.600
But honestly, I never played it.

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:31.640
I couldn't tell you.

02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:33.960
I think I've never heard of it.

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:38.760
I think this was the game that recycled some of the Final Fantasy 14 assets.

02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:39.240
It sure did.

02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:42.760
But I don't think that's that big of a deal.

02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:48.840
Like, it just sounds like the game was a very obvious sort of games as a service kind of

02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:49.240
thing.

02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:51.400
And I think, I don't know.

02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:54.760
I think gamers have just had their fill of a lot of these, and it's probably hard to

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:57.240
shove an original IP out there with this at this point.

02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:58.440
But we'll see.

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:01.640
All right, moving on.

02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:02.360
Dark Sakura.

02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:09.880
So there already is a little bit of controversy around the multiverses game.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:17.640
Velma, her power is being changed in the game because she has the ability to call the police.

02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:25.800
And since there are black characters in the game, it has definitely, especially in light

02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:32.600
of, you know, past white women calling the police for people, you know, doing a barbecue

02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:34.120
in a public park, for example.

02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:38.920
You know, birds, watering flowers.

02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:44.040
She has been referred to as a Karen in the game.

02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:52.520
And so the response is that they're going to change her power from being like a big

02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:59.160
snitch and Karen to, you know, actually doing something different.

02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:03.560
And they say that her abilities changed Thursday.

02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:08.200
Instead of calling the police, Velma now solves the mystery and calls the mystery ink gang

02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:11.080
and mystery machine to take the bad guys away.

02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:14.440
They just replaced the cop car with the mystery machine car.

02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:17.960
But it still reads a lot better than it did before.

02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:26.200
Well, to keep going back out, Warner Brothers Interactive said that it was welcomed by some

02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:31.320
players that, you know, and in fact, one person on Twitter, I'm going to read the quote because

02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:36.040
it's apt, Velma got updated to multiverses and now she doesn't call the cops, which good

02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:38.280
they shouldn't have gotten there to begin with.

02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:40.840
She calls the mystery machine now, which just makes more sense.

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:47.560
Um, and people are saying that they like how responsive the developers are being, but not

02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:48.760
everyone really likes it.

02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:53.880
Another person says, I'm sick of the whole Velma is a Karen narrative that has come out

02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:54.680
of multiverses.

02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:58.920
Velma actually does her research and collects evidence before calling the cops on her opponents.

02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:00.200
She's clearly not a Karen.

02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:08.440
Honestly, though, they're missing the point that she is calling the police on, you know,

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:09.800
black characters in the game.

02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:15.080
I mean, it's every character in the game, but it's specific that she, you know, that

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:22.360
there is a definite societal connotation there that isn't the type of message we should be

02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:23.160
sending out there.

02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:30.120
There's this thing called optics and reading the room and the room was red and yeah.

02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:34.840
And that doesn't, they don't, it just shouldn't have been there.

02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:35.240
Yeah.

02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:39.960
It's the, the only, the only criticism I have about this, I just have one minor, I don't,

02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:43.800
I don't care that they, well, actually I think it's good that they replaced the, uh, uh,

02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:45.320
cop car with the mystery machine.

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:49.400
My one complaint is that when the mystery machine opens up to put the play or the other

02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:52.120
player in there, a cloud of smoke should be coming out of the car.

02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:55.880
That's my only complaint, uh, is that they miss that opportunity with the mystery machine.

02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:57.080
It is a level of realism.

02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:59.720
That's just the person in there and hot box them.

02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:02.440
They don't care about doing it anymore.

02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:03.080
Exactly.

02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:05.320
That's my complaint.

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:06.440
Otherwise, yeah.

02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:07.640
All right.

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:09.160
Let's move on.

02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:12.040
Just a few more stories for you and then we'll get to the listener round table.

02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:12.540
Loki.

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:14.140
All right.

02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:20.840
I mean, I am really not surprised when it comes to this company, but Ubisoft is going

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:29.560
to be adapting or adopting a $70 price tag model for their major releases because they

02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:37.880
feel that these games on PlayStation four as well from PlayStation five and Xbox series X.

02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:41.960
So I don't think it mentioned anything about PlayStation four.

02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:45.480
I don't even know if these games are coming out on PlayStation four.

02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:53.480
Um, but yeah, not excited about it, especially when you have these companies that put out

02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:58.120
games, you know, that this price point and the games are still unpolished.

02:05:58.120 --> 02:06:00.440
You know, I'm, I don't know.

02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:02.440
I don't think it's worth it, but you know what?

02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:05.880
You have to look at your wallet and see if it's worth it.

02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:08.440
Here's a great new technique when it comes to these games.

02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:15.000
You just wait two years and then they go on Xbox game pass and then you don't pay anything.

02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:17.400
Well, I mean, you're paying your game pass.

02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:22.760
I don't pay anything more, but honestly, if you know how to work that Microsoft rewards

02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:27.400
program, which I I've kind of fallen off the map from doing, I was a lot better at it before.

02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:32.600
I was, I was getting a lot of my months of game pass comped by just like, you know,

02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:35.320
doing all the surveys and all that crap.

02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:40.760
So I honestly, you probably could work the system and get it for free if you actually

02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:42.520
are willing to do that.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:48.520
Um, I would say with minimal effort, you could probably get every third month comped, uh,

02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:51.720
with fairly minimal effort, as long as you check in that app once in a while.

02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:56.840
But yeah, there was this additional money going to, uh, fund the people that will be

02:06:56.840 --> 02:07:02.680
looking into ease, come on for all the, uh, propagating of bad culture at the company

02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:03.960
and all the sexual harassment.

02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:05.240
Is any of that money going to that?

02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:11.880
Uh, sadly, I don't think it is, uh, but that's a very fair call out that you, uh, bring up

02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:12.440
there.

02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:17.240
So, I mean, I feel that, you know, a company with those kinds of quality standards, uh,

02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:20.200
within the company certainly is worth an extra $10.

02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:23.560
I mean, clearly they've, they've addressed all the issues.

02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:23.800
Yes.

02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:26.520
I'll pay an extra $10 for your game when you fire ease, come on.

02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:30.760
That's, that's the $10 decision that needs to be made.

02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:31.080
Yes.

02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:36.040
I realize shareholders and that's probably not really going to happen.

02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:36.680
It needs to.

02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:37.800
All right.

02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:41.720
Anyway, meantime, I'll tell you what you can spend your money on.

02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:48.440
If you want to do a value in gaming, I'll tell you what.

02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:53.560
Whoever has the rights to Garfield boy.

02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:54.200
Oh boy.

02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:59.240
The people that come up with these Garfield games, they could not come up with an original

02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:02.120
idea to, to, to save their life.

02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:07.400
Let me tell you, if somebody had a gun to their head and said, Hey, Garfield people,

02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:09.480
you need to come up with original idea.

02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:10.280
Well, guess what?

02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:16.280
This week it was announced Garfield lasagna party is coming out bang because it's just

02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:19.400
a rip off of Mario party basically.

02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:20.600
And that's what's coming out.

02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:25.800
But it's coming out on PlayStation five, all the Xbox consoles, of course, PS four,

02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:27.800
Xbox one, switch and PC.

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:30.120
It's launching in November.

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:30.680
That's right.

02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:36.040
You can play party games with Garfield, Odie, Arlene, Nirmal.

02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:39.000
I don't know if the rest of the U S acres characters are there.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:44.920
I wonder if, if Greg is doing any of the voices, if they bring in like the U S acres characters.

02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:46.680
Yeah, no idea.

02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:48.600
And I don't, I only see those four.

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:52.840
They just say, play us one of the four iconic characters from Jim Davis's iconic comics.

02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:56.600
So they don't say anything about the, um, the other characters.

02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:03.800
So we'll see, uh, maybe there'll be DLC, uh, uh, dynamic party game filled with crazy

02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:05.240
and tasty mini games.

02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:09.400
You can tell this is just a copy paste and press release, uh, pizza square, slicing

02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:13.720
challenge, snowballs, throwing competition, obstacle race, and more.

02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:25.400
I'm sure this game is going to be unique and never before seen and just groundbreaking.

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:27.640
Anyway, there you go.

02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:29.000
Lasagna party.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.160
Uh, I agree with Zen monkey and chat who says we need Heathcliff games.

02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:33.560
Yes.

02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:34.120
Yes, we do.

02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:40.840
Heathcliff in the, uh, that Nintendo all star brawl thing, or is it just Garfield?

02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:43.720
Nintendo all star brawl.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:45.160
Yeah.

02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.720
I thought they had like a Nintendo one with all the Nicktoons stuff.

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.440
Oh, then it's the Nickelodeon.

02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:50.760
Also.

02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:52.120
No, I think just Garfield's in that.

02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:52.440
I'm sorry.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:55.720
I was thinking Nickelodeon brothers.

02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:56.120
What?

02:09:56.120 --> 02:09:57.240
No, no, no.

02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:02.600
I was thinking Nickelodeon for some reason said Nintendo, but, um, yeah.

02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:06.920
In the Nickelodeon game, that's where they should throw it on.

02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:09.400
They could have a throw it on between Garfield and Heathcliff.

02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:12.120
Uh, tiger class says we need eek the cat.

02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:13.480
I could sign up for that.

02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:14.040
Oh my God.

02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:14.760
Eek the cat.

02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:19.080
I just, I want some more like old school Nickelodeon fucking base.

02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:22.600
And I'm talking, they need to go even deeper for us forties.

02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:24.440
They need to go even deeper on set.

02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:30.760
Like we need some, we need, we need more Canadian television that they repackaged on

02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:32.360
Nickelodeon for the America.

02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:34.200
I'm talking today special.

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:36.760
I'm talking pinwheel special.

02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:38.360
You can't do that on television.

02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:40.040
Let's get some Mr.

02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:41.000
Wizard up in there.

02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:47.320
I want, I want moose as a playable character in the Nickelodeon game and, and, uh, Lisa

02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:48.120
ruddy.

02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:55.160
I want, um, fucking Eureka's castle, Turkey television, duckula, duckula.

02:10:57.240 --> 02:10:59.160
I want it all 1990s tomorrow.

02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:01.240
People got a danger mouse.

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:03.800
Christ, y'all are on a roll.

02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:07.720
That's, that's the Nickelodeon all stars game we deserve.

02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:11.560
Like, is there a code I can put in on the menu to unlock danger mouse?

02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:12.520
Is that a thing I can do?

02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:14.840
Welcome freshman.

02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:15.560
Oh my God.

02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:18.600
Like your, your talent should be penfold.

02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:23.880
What did they, there was this Canadian soap opera and Ryan Reynolds, I think was on it.

02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:27.160
That's how, I think they called it 15 here.

02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:28.600
Oh yeah.

02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:34.520
But it was just, again, all those Nickelodeon shows were like repackaged Canadian shows.

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.480
Like, but then they like stuff like, like you can't do that on television.

02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:42.280
Those people were more popular here than they were in Canada.

02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:45.000
This is funny how that stuff works out.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.600
So anyway, all right.

02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:51.960
Zen monkey 11 and chat says, yeah, it was called 15.

02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:53.400
I hated that show.

02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:56.520
What did they call then MTV?

02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:00.760
It wasn't a Canadian show at this point, but MTV did a dramatic soap, undressed.

02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:03.160
That was, did you have all ever watched undressed?

02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:05.880
That show is scandalous.

02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:07.080
That show is scandalous.

02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:08.040
Yeah.

02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:08.440
Anyway.

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:09.720
All right.

02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:11.000
Moving on.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.520
Let's get to the listener round table.

02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:15.880
Do we have any emails this week?

02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:19.000
Participate at orangesontrader.com is the place to send emails.

02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:20.840
Nary a one.

02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:21.240
All right.

02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:22.120
Ooh.

02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:26.360
That does mean we get to divulge into drag race content, but I don't, I there's, I'm

02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:27.720
not watching anything now.

02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:30.440
They revealed everybody on celebrity drag race.

02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:31.800
Oh, did they?

02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:32.860
Yeah.

02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:37.000
And it's everyone I thought thought it was going to be.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.520
Well, the, the guy from mean girls was so obvious.

02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:41.800
Like that had to be him.

02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:42.200
Right.

02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:44.120
Like you could tell that was him.

02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:45.240
Mark and Delicato.

02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:49.000
Um, ugly Betty.

02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:54.840
There was, oh, he was like a little kid then, but that was like 10 years ago.

02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:55.960
He's probably in his twenties now.

02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:57.080
Yeah.

02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:57.480
Yeah.

02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:00.120
There were, um, Oh God.

02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:06.040
Um, Oh, uh, Tatiana, uh, Ali.

02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:08.760
Oh, okay.

02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:10.120
As in Ashley banks.

02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:10.360
Yeah.

02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:10.680
Yeah.

02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:19.640
Um, some, some comments from chat because now everybody's talking about the, the reminiscing

02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:23.560
see a Tiberian chat says undressed on before love line.

02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:25.880
Have I had to have told this on OLR at some point, right?

02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:29.240
I was, I was on love line, not the TV show, but the radio shows.

02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:31.720
Y'all know it was a radio show way before then.

02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:33.720
And it was, I was on it once.

02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:37.240
And, but I called because I wanted to talk to the celebrity guests.

02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:38.040
I did not know.

02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:40.920
It's not one of those things where, Ooh, tell us what your question was, Rob.

02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:43.240
No, cause it wasn't, it wasn't anything juicy like that.

02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:51.480
I wanted to talk to, um, Kennedy, the MTV VJ was on the show and I called in to ask

02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:55.880
her a question because that was in my era of that's the type of work I want to do.

02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:57.400
Look how far I made it.

02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:02.120
Um, and, uh, uh, I wanted to, I don't remember exactly what the question was.

02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:04.600
Something about like her success and all that stuff.

02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:07.240
Um, and uh, yeah, I got to talk to her.

02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:09.240
So that was, that was fun.

02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:09.740
Yeah.

02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:11.100
So, yeah.

02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:12.840
Uh, we, we love it.

02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:14.060
Yeah.

02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:18.840
Uh, as Joan Hunter Matt reminds us Elvira's birthday was yesterday.

02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:19.720
Yeah.

02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:21.640
She's, uh, 71 now I think.

02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:22.140
Right?

02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:24.600
Oh, Cassandra's going strong.

02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:25.100
Yep.

02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:25.600
Yep.

02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:31.040
The, the, uh, uh, I'm sorry, but the, the first big drag queen on television before

02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:33.200
RuPaul was Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:41.600
Do not forget the, the, the, probably the best and biggest drag queen of all time is

02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:43.360
Cassandra Peterson, Elvira.

02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:43.860
Indeed.

02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:45.140
All right.

02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:47.760
You know, when, when even Ru says it.

02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:50.160
Yeah, Elvira is a drag queen, period.

02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:55.040
Like that's just, it's just that, that wasn't the word for it yet, but Elvira is absolutely

02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:55.600
a drag queen.

02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:56.900
All right.

02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:59.040
Um, let's see what else?

02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:00.560
Oh, we have somebody in the green room.

02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:02.560
Why don't we get to some calls?

02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:06.560
So if you want to join the green room, just go to vognetwork.com slash discord.

02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:10.160
And you too can be on Orange Launch Radio, just like this caller here.

02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:11.360
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:11.860
Who's this?

02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:14.160
It is the one and only Ron.

02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:15.440
How is everybody doing tonight?

02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:17.280
Hey, I am fantastic, Ron.

02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:18.160
How about yourself?

02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:22.240
Except I lost a Loki somehow, but I'll, I'll find him here while you talk to us here.

02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:23.920
Use the Konami code.

02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:24.480
He'll come back.

02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:26.160
Apparently or something.

02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:28.720
So I don't know what I'm hiding behind dark sacros.

02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:29.040
Fine.

02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:29.920
I probably know.

02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:31.200
I just moved the scene around.

02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:34.160
I'll fix it live on air as I always do, but let's talk.

02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:36.560
I've done the same thing when we go live.

02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:38.160
I'm like, Oh, I forgot to change the episode.

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:40.000
The title episode changed that real quick.

02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:41.600
Yeah, I don't.

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:44.480
I literally like deleted Loki somehow.

02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:44.720
All right.

02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:45.280
That's all right.

02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:48.880
So we'll just, we'll duplicate one of the other ones and get them back.

02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:51.440
Well, what's on your mind while I fix it live here?

02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:52.240
Rama, how are you?

02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:53.600
I'm good.

02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:54.400
I'm tired.

02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:55.680
I just unpacked from a trip.

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.160
Now I've got to pack for a trip for this weekend.

02:15:58.160 --> 02:15:59.120
So, you know, but.

02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:01.280
Enough about that.

02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:02.080
A couple of things.

02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:05.920
I'll be on my merry little way that I can just enjoy the rest of the show dinner and

02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:06.880
watch anime.

02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:08.800
Now I just find it funny.

02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:18.960
Well, yeah, I try to make something interesting as best I possibly can, but this whole Ubisoft

02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:20.320
thing, $10 more.

02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:26.240
I'm just saying if you want to save the $10, just get the Xbox version because remember

02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:29.360
the Xbox version is the same green case.

02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:33.680
And when you buy and you pull it out, it says Xbox one Xbox series on it.

02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:34.880
So there you go.

02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:37.360
No good point.

02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:40.080
And I still say my advice from before also stands.

02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:43.760
Just wait for them to give it away because they all inevitably get given away or put

02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:48.320
on those like game pass, uh, PlayStation plus like those types of things because there's

02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:50.080
money to be made still there.

02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:52.000
You know, that is true.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:56.880
I mean, I picked up cryptid and necro dancer for switch for like four bucks, like over

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:57.520
the weekend.

02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:03.840
So if you're willing, yeah, if you're willing to wait two years to play a game and I get

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:03.920
it.

02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:07.920
Sometimes we're not, sometimes we're not like final fantasy 16.

02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:08.800
No, bitch.

02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:10.960
Day one, day fucking one.

02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:12.400
I totally get that.

02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:15.520
There are some games I will day one purchase the others.

02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:20.240
I'll just put in my honey list and I'll just wait till it tells me, Oh, it's on sale for

02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:21.520
such and such price.

02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:23.840
And which I did during the pandemic.

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:31.200
And I realized I have probably over $500 worth of physical games I purchased during the pandemic

02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:32.560
that is still sealed.

02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:34.400
That should be the pandemic.

02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:34.640
Yep.

02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:35.440
The pandemic.

02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:36.240
The pandemic.

02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:37.360
I like that.

02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:39.520
I'm going to use that for now on the pandemic.

02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:42.240
My friends, Patty and Steph coined at the pandemic.

02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:43.600
Same Patty.

02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:44.640
I know from a jazz.

02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:46.080
No, a different Patty.

02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:47.040
She's okay.

02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:47.200
Yeah.

02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:49.120
I have to introduce y'all one day.

02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:50.000
You will love her.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.760
I, you know what?

02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:57.040
Miss, Miss Melody and I have been talking and we did text Victoria as well about a return

02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:58.800
to New York type of trip.

02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:03.520
But what we realized, Rama, the only thing that we kind of are interested in seeing on

02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:06.880
Broadway right now is Funny Girl with Lea Michele.

02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:11.520
And it's, it's literally one of those, like, we're morbidly curious.

02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:13.040
And that's the only way to describe it.

02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:16.320
Like, we have to be in the room.

02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:20.000
We have to be in the room for a second.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.600
I thought she was going to say Phantom of the Opera.

02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:23.120
I was gonna go, not you too.

02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:25.040
No, that news hadn't come out yet.

02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:31.120
I feel like Phantom of the Opera plays in like every fucking town in America at some

02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:31.360
point.

02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:34.320
And it's the same damn thing from a same thing with the Lion King.

02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:36.080
How's the Lion King still on Broadway?

02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:39.120
That show comes to every town in America.

02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:45.200
You can go to Walla Walla, Washington and see a performance of the Lion King, just like

02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:46.080
it is on Broadway.

02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:48.080
Maybe not the same stars, but you know what?

02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:49.360
It's acted just fine.

02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:52.160
I want to take you all to see Beetlejuice.

02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:53.520
That was amazing.

02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:54.480
Oh, that would have been fun.

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:56.320
No, it's still playing.

02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:56.880
Oh, is it?

02:18:57.680 --> 02:18:58.640
It came back.

02:18:58.640 --> 02:18:59.760
It came back.

02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:00.400
Oh, nice.

02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:00.720
Nice.

02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:03.440
Pod Culture says don't knock on Phantom.

02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:04.000
I'm not.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.600
I'm just saying it's the same fucking show that tours America all the time.

02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:08.800
And it's just as good.

02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:12.080
You're not going to see Sarah Brightman in that show ever again.

02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:13.600
So you know what?

02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:16.720
Let the other actresses have their moment.

02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:18.720
I don't like Sarah Brightman, so I don't care.

02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:18.960
Oh, no.

02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:19.760
What did she do?

02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:20.160
Did she?

02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:22.800
No, it's just her voice is too brassy.

02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:23.920
Oh, I love her.

02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:26.560
I do not like her voice in Phantom.

02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:28.000
Legit.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:28.800
Disagree on that.

02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.360
Well, honestly, honestly, it was Repo, the genetic opera that sold me on her.

02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:35.360
I love her in that movie.

02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:36.720
That's the only thing she's been in that I like her in.

02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:40.000
Okay, on that we agree that she's good in that.

02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:41.920
I still like her in other stuff.

02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:46.400
Anyway, look, here's the thing.

02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:46.960
Here's the thing.

02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:49.760
I'm going to just say this very plainly and very openly.

02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:56.400
Sometimes there is music that you want to listen to when you just feel like a gigantic

02:19:57.520 --> 02:19:58.560
homosexual slur.

02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:00.400
Okay, I'm not going to say it, but you know the word.

02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:04.320
When you're just in that mood where I feel like a gigantic tonight.

02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:08.080
Sarah Brightman is one of those CDs that you will put on.

02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:14.160
You will put on and it's just like, I'm just, I am feeling my gay oats tonight.

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:20.080
Listening to some Sarah Brightman deliver me out of the sadness.

02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:21.360
It's that 100%.

02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:24.000
Rob, are you having a moment right now?

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.160
Because I can always I might be.

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:28.400
I might be putting on some Sarah Brightman after the show tonight.

02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:28.880
I might.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:30.400
You know what?

02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:30.960
You know what?

02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:36.080
Before I get to the second topic, I just love how when I call in, we don't derail.

02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:41.680
We just jump the fucking rail, end up on a track like halfway across town.

02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:50.000
When you call in, the train's driver three mode is activated and anything can happen, Rama.

02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:55.840
Now, the other thing we're talking about is G4.

02:20:56.400 --> 02:21:02.560
And as I said in the chat, the fact that anything G4 related is not on Peacock.

02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:04.800
That's the first thing you should know.

02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:11.120
There was no faith in this because any of the Comcast network is on Peacock.

02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:13.760
That was my earliest prediction about that whole thing.

02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:16.720
When they first announced G4, I was like, oh, they're putting it on Peacock.

02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:17.280
That's the whole thing.

02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:19.440
And it wasn't that you're right.

02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:21.120
Why isn't it on Peacock?

02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:24.560
No, no, but WWE is on Peacock, but G4 isn't.

02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:25.920
Interesting.

02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:32.080
I just, you know, because that again, we talk about cable going away and it's going to go

02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:32.640
away.

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:35.600
It's going to be things like Peacock and, you know, all these other.

02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:37.840
Unfortunately, it's the battle of the streaming networks.

02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:40.960
But you are starting to see consolidation.

02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:45.200
You know, you're starting to see that they're realizing, you know, for better and for worse.

02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:47.360
So when I say for worse, I mean, discovery.

02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:49.120
We all know we all know.

02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:49.600
Let's not.

02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:50.800
Oh, let's not.

02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:52.880
Because I have a napalm with their name on it.

02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:53.520
Oh, let's not.

02:21:54.320 --> 02:21:57.120
Careful when you say things like that on a live Internet show.

02:21:57.120 --> 02:21:58.400
He's speaking in a hyperbole.

02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:05.040
Anyway, but the other thing now, now the train really did derail.

02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:06.480
Oh, Showtime.

02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:07.760
That was the big one.

02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:12.640
So they're realizing people don't want to pay like, what is it, like 10 bucks a month

02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:14.000
just for Showtime stuff?

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.360
Yeah, $10 extra.

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:15.520
Yeah.

02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:17.760
And so they're going to merge.

02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:21.680
They're going to merge Showtime into, I think, Paramount Plus at this point, which it's all

02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:26.400
good because there's a bundle deal going on.

02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:28.960
If you pay for it, you go into the app, you push up.

02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:32.080
It brings up the Showtime stuff, Hulu and Prime.

02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:37.440
I did buy Showtime at one point for one specific show.

02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:39.760
And then I immediately canceled it when said show is over.

02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:40.640
And that was Twin Peaks.

02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:43.360
The return I did it for Dexter.

02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:45.680
And I'm just severely disappointed how it ended.

02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:47.760
So I'm like, I don't care if there's a season two.

02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:49.040
I'm not resubbing for it.

02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:53.520
Yeah, but I'll resub for a season four of Twin Peaks if it ever happens.

02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:57.760
But I don't expect David Lynch to actually do it, but I hope fair.

02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:00.720
Now, here's the thing about G4.

02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:07.200
I have no desire because there's nothing on there that caters interest me.

02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:13.040
I enjoy watching more tech YouTubers and tech Twitch streams and so forth.

02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:14.800
That's more interesting to me.

02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:22.480
What G4, I mean, we're at the point where gaming is console and PC.

02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:26.560
I understand that G4 has some known streamers on there.

02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:29.280
But honestly, it ain't doing a lick of good.

02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:33.920
They're too busy fighting back against the woke, which I'm all for.

02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:37.840
Because there are people out there who are running their mouth that need not to.

02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:42.480
OK, but what G4 needs to do is cater everybody.

02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:47.280
Have a show about technology, about building and repairs.

02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:52.480
I've always said for the longest I wanted a Geek Squad-esque reality show on there where

02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:56.720
it shows them working on these computers and talking about how people can't do certain

02:23:56.720 --> 02:23:57.040
stuff.

02:23:57.040 --> 02:24:04.320
Yeah, that's my cup of tea.

02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:07.040
You know, I'm just getting my depth and chat says, wait, wait, wait.

02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:08.080
Fight against the woke.

02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:10.880
Can you know what I mean against them?

02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:11.920
But, you know.

02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:12.880
Oh, OK.

02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:17.040
So like earlier what you were saying earlier that I got it, got it, got it, got it.

02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:19.920
That's what I meant.

02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:22.720
You know, it sounded backwards the way it came out with.

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:23.440
I get I get you now.

02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:23.920
I get you now.

02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:27.680
Yeah, normally I kind of have like a little notepad here of everything.

02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:28.320
I want to find.

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:29.680
I'm glad I asked.

02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:34.800
Fifth Dream says, yeah, G4 is OK, but it's nothing I can't get from any other random

02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:35.520
Twitch streamer.

02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:40.080
Tiger class says G4 TV needs somebody like a Linus with all the tech stuff.

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:43.520
It it needs a sort of must see TV.

02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:47.840
And I feel like right now it's kind of living in a nostalgia realm with things like X play

02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:48.720
and so forth, which is fine.

02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:50.240
And clearly there's an audience for that.

02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:52.400
We have people in our chat that are still watching.

02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:52.880
And that's good.

02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:55.040
Again, I'm not I'm not here to yuck your yum.

02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:56.080
You know, that's great.

02:24:56.080 --> 02:25:02.560
I'm just saying the landscape is a lot different now than it was in 2006 when that was the

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:08.000
only way to see tech content in the media was either tech TV or, you know, when the merger

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:11.760
first happened or early G4, whatever, whatever side of the fence you're on.

02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:13.920
That was the only way to see it back in the day.

02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:15.440
That's just not the case anymore.

02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:18.320
It has to compete with literally everything else.

02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:20.000
So it needs more moments.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:28.320
And I'm just I'm not sure I'm not sure how resting on the successes of the past are going

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:30.080
to make it new fans.

02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:33.360
I see how it enthuses the old fans.

02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:35.840
I don't see how it adds new fans.

02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:39.600
But I you know, again, I'm not trying to run a TV network.

02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:41.680
It's a lot more complicated than I think.

02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:47.440
So, you know, you know what I've done G4 good if they actually did live streams of Evo or

02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:49.120
highlights of that, if they had something like that.

02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:54.000
Actually, I don't know if you remember a couple of years back coverage what they used to do.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:56.720
I believe it was a couple of years back.

02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:00.080
Disney was showing a gaming tournament on their channel.

02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:01.280
I was like, wait, what?

02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:01.680
Yeah.

02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:01.920
You know?

02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:04.960
No, that I think you make a good point.

02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:10.080
And to be fair and out of interest, the pandemic and all that is probably lowered the opportunities

02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:11.920
for G4 to really push into that space.

02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:16.560
But I think you bring up an excellent point is that, you know, people always will flock

02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:20.880
back to TV and live TV and local TV and that stuff for live events.

02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:24.240
And I think the more of that the G4 can kind of bring in, I think I think you're right

02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:25.600
that that would be very interesting.

02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:32.480
So Zen Monkey is pointing out one of the ex hosts did a I'm sorry ex host did a full live

02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:33.840
stream of a cosplay event.

02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:37.600
So they probably just, you know, need to lean into that a little more.

02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:43.840
Yeah, because gaming is, it's basically all encompassing gaming, tech, cosplay, anime,

02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:44.320
all of that.

02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:50.480
I mean, you could you could have shows about not just gaming, but have some shows about

02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:55.120
tech, what's going on, have some shows, like, maybe throw some anime on there stream that

02:26:55.120 --> 02:27:00.320
because remember, tech TV was showing late night anime and that did help, you know, it's

02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:05.200
a little bit of everything that could work, you know, because, because let's be real,

02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:10.400
I don't want to turn on G4 and watch another episode of Star Trek Next Generation.

02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:12.000
Not to have nothing against it.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.640
But to me personally, it ain't the show to what I expect to find on it.

02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:21.360
Now, if they took the video game Star Trek The Next Generation, I was doing parody episodes

02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:22.720
with it with the graphics.

02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:27.840
Yeah, wasn't that literally there was a show like that on the old old G4.

02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:28.960
It was MMOs.

02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:30.800
They did lines.

02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:31.920
They dubbed over MMOs.

02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:37.280
That was like one of the earliest shows on the original G4 before tech TV portal.

02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:38.080
This is what that was.

02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:39.920
It was called Portal before there was a game called that.

02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:43.280
Bring back code monkeys, you know, come on now.

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:46.640
There is so much stuff going on in the gaming industry.

02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:48.080
They could easily parody.

02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:50.720
That's like five seasons of content right there.

02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:52.720
All right.

02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:55.120
Well, my friend, do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:57.120
Oh, no, that's it.

02:27:57.120 --> 02:27:59.680
Besides the fact I like Jamie's new hairstyle.

02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:01.600
It's kind of banging rocket.

02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:04.640
I actually was trying to fix the shave myself.

02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:06.480
So hold on.

02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:08.160
Let me show you what I ended up doing.

02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:13.280
I'm going to actually be going to sport clips like, you know, the place where the dudes

02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:14.000
get their hair done.

02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:18.800
This is what I did as far as I can do by myself.

02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:21.760
I think you did a really good job.

02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:24.000
It's a lot better than what I did during the pandemic.

02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:26.320
Screw this and just shave my head bald.

02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:27.840
OK, I came close to that, though.

02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:33.120
But I am after Twitch Con.

02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:36.400
I am going to let it grow out.

02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:39.680
But when they get the fuzzy underside, it's going to be purple.

02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:43.920
Oh, I like I am going to have magneto hair.

02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:47.680
I'm going to shave freshly bald for Twitch Con.

02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:50.160
So. All right.

02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:53.040
Wait, Rob, I have to ask you,

02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:55.840
do you do it yourself or do you have someone do it?

02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:56.480
Alan, does it?

02:28:57.600 --> 02:28:59.360
That way, I don't miss any spots or anything like that.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.840
I'm having I'm having Dan touch mine up.

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:03.200
Nice.

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:06.160
That is the purpose of a spouse to shave your head.

02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:08.400
All right.

02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:12.640
All right, my friend, Rama, anything else on your mind before we let you go?

02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:17.600
Give Alan some love for us, because we know he's he's dealing, you know.

02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:21.520
He's actually I think I said this at the very beginning, you weren't here yet, but him

02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:26.480
and I tested negative on the same day, except it was day 11 for me and I think day seven for him.

02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:28.320
But he had Paxlevid.

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:36.960
He didn't get prescribed Paxlevid, but in a genius move by someone's health care company,

02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:41.520
they got Paxlevid showing up on their doorstep on day six after it was too late to take it.

02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:45.360
So it was too late for me, but it wasn't too late for him.

02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:47.120
So you know what I said?

02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:47.760
Just take it.

02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:48.240
And he did.

02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:51.280
And he got over it like, what, four days faster as a result.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.040
Hey, pay it forward.

02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:54.080
Exactly.

02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:55.760
And I'm a firework for cosplay.

02:29:55.760 --> 02:30:00.480
I guess I guess I am admitting to some type of, you know, probably federal issue here.

02:30:00.480 --> 02:30:02.320
Look, he's my fucking husband.

02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:06.560
And you would do it too for your spouse if you were in the same situation.

02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:11.840
So don't fucking come to me with, you know, the rules and regulations.

02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:12.400
Exactly.

02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:13.280
Just does it on his own.

02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:14.320
Anyone would.

02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:15.600
So all right.

02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:21.760
Um, and if you want to blame anybody, blame my health care provider for being so freaking

02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:25.680
messy, they didn't get me the meds until it was already day six and didn't even notice

02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:26.800
that it was day six.

02:30:26.800 --> 02:30:29.040
So you never got prescribed it at all.

02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:32.560
That's a whole other issue.

02:30:32.560 --> 02:30:33.360
So anyway.

02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:35.280
All right, that's going to do it.

02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:37.040
Rama, thank you so much for calling in.

02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:38.560
Have a fantastic rest of your night.

02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:39.360
Okay.

02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:39.680
I will.

02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:41.840
You take care and y'all stay fabulous and awesome.

02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:42.240
All right.

02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:42.640
I will.

02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:44.160
It's all it's all I know how to do.

02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:44.960
All right.

02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:45.520
Bye, my friend.

02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:46.800
Bye.

02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:47.600
All right.

02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:51.600
Uh, let's see the whole reason I never got prescribed, by the way, is because I had a

02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:56.080
negative, uh, uh, test, uh, test there.

02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:57.840
And then I had a positive antigen test.

02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:01.120
That is so interesting.

02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:04.400
No, I was just like, I sent you the picture of my results too.

02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:04.720
I know.

02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:06.240
I was just like, Hey, I have diabetes.

02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:07.120
Can I get Paxilid?

02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:11.280
And then like three days later it was like, Oh no, I got the boilerplate answer first.

02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:13.040
And then three days later, Oh, I'm sorry.

02:31:13.120 --> 02:31:15.440
I was out of the office and I'm just now seeing this.

02:31:15.440 --> 02:31:17.280
I'll make sure you get it ASAP.

02:31:17.280 --> 02:31:20.800
And sure enough, it gets delivered up on my door the next day on day six when it's, you're

02:31:20.800 --> 02:31:23.040
not, and if you don't know, you're not supposed to take it after day five.

02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:24.720
It's ineffective after day five.

02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:28.240
So I'm pretty sure that that's why I never got prescribed it.

02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:33.440
Cause I didn't get my days off and you know, I should have probably had it right at the

02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:36.560
beginning given my other condition, but it is what it is.

02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:37.040
I'm with us.

02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:37.680
J one hundred mad.

02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:38.240
It's ridiculous.

02:31:38.240 --> 02:31:40.320
You can't just walk into a store and buy it at this point.

02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:48.480
I mean, but I understand though that there are people who don't have it, but I think

02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:52.720
and it needs to really be saved for the people who legitimately need it.

02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:53.920
It's fair, fair.

02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:54.320
All right.

02:31:54.320 --> 02:31:59.200
I want to go to tweets over twitter.com slash O L R and dark Tetsuya reminding me of this

02:31:59.200 --> 02:32:00.160
other one.

02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:03.360
This other announcement for Tokyo game show and it was specifically Konami.

02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:07.440
And you know, dark Tetsuya had something to say about the creators of La Mulana and what

02:32:07.440 --> 02:32:08.240
they're doing next.

02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:10.240
But I actually think this is pretty cool.

02:32:10.240 --> 02:32:17.760
So do you remember how Konami was running a competition for revitalizing one of their

02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:19.920
old franchises?

02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:24.080
If you were an indie developer and you had a good idea, they were going to help you basically

02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:24.960
revitalize.

02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:31.760
So long story short, the guy behind La Mulana pitched a maze of galleous remake, which

02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:34.800
ironically was the game that inspired La Mulana and he won.

02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:40.160
So yeah, so that's the La Mulana.

02:32:40.160 --> 02:32:42.080
That's so interesting how that came full circle.

02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:46.800
So it's the game that inspired La Mulana is now going to get a remake or redo by the La

02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:47.440
Mulana group.

02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:48.960
What's that?

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:50.000
You know, he was tickled.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:53.040
Oh, well, he was and dark Tetsuya was, that's for sure.

02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:53.360
Yes.

02:32:53.360 --> 02:32:54.240
Oh yeah, for sure.

02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:55.040
That's huge news.

02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:55.920
That's great.

02:32:55.920 --> 02:32:57.200
So all right.

02:32:57.840 --> 02:33:01.040
If you want to send us some tweets, twitter.com slash O L R.

02:33:01.040 --> 02:33:04.400
But with that, that's the tweets, that's the emails, that's the calls.

02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:06.320
So that's the show.

02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:08.160
We had a full show, fun show tonight.

02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:10.160
Thank you all for listening and tuning in tonight.

02:33:10.160 --> 02:33:11.040
Really appreciate it.

02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:15.760
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Tons Radio, please tell a friend or two about

02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:16.320
the show.

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:19.280
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:21.040
need more voices in the room.

02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:25.360
A nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you heard this show.

02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:27.920
Those nice five star reviews go an awful long way.

02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:29.680
So thank you so much for those.

02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:31.920
Be sure to follow us over at VOG Network.

02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:33.920
That's V O G Network on Twitch as well.

02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:35.440
That is also appreciated.

02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:37.840
That is it for now.

02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:39.920
We'll be back next week to do it all again.

02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:43.920
But just heads up, we will be off in early October.

02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:49.360
We are not going to be here the night of October 9th, I think it is.

02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:50.800
You are correct.

02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:51.920
That is TwitchCon.

02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:54.800
And you've heard Dark Soccer and I both talking about how we will both be there.

02:33:55.520 --> 02:34:02.160
So, well, actually I may be back just in time, but I'm not going to push it.

02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:07.360
So Loki will be here and maybe he'll maybe he'll stream some of his big build or something.

02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:08.080
I don't know.

02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:10.400
But there will be no official we've done by then.

02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:11.860
Yeah.

02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:13.220
So.

02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:14.180
All right.

02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:17.760
That is going to do it.

02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:21.440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:22.880
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:27.760
I'm getting sick of all these motherfucking Weskers in this motherfucking game.

02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:28.560
Right?

02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:29.060
God.

02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:31.600
They need to nerve him.

02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:32.480
Oh, no.

02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:35.760
On Friday when we were playing, we just all DC'd at the same time.

02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:37.040
And you know, I don't DC.

02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:37.600
Yeah, I know.

02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:42.080
His passive does not need to be as strong as it is.

02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:46.080
I don't know what they were thinking giving him that in addition to his already existing ability.

02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:49.040
His passive needs a huge nerf to it.

02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:53.520
Survivors do not need to gain the passive stuff as fast as they do.

02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:57.920
And they shouldn't have nerfed a self-care.

02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:01.280
Their locations don't need to be given away when they use an antidote either.

02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:05.040
So they need to nerf that, I think.

02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:06.560
And Wesker will be fine.

02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:09.840
Anyway, have a good stream, Dark Soccer.

02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:10.960
We'll see you next week.

02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:12.240
Thank you.

02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:14.560
I will see you all in whenever.

02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:16.160
Bye, everybody.

02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:16.560
Bye-bye.

02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:18.240
Let's go to Loki and your final thought tonight.

02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:22.160
I didn't really have too much other than I did want to mention I just saw there was

02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:26.000
another game announcement for Rise of the Triad Ludicrous Edition.

02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:31.120
It's a remaster of the original Rise of the Triad.

02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:35.920
Now in 4K, although, I mean, it doesn't really need to be in 4K because, you know,

02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:37.360
it was an old DOS game.

02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:40.720
But new map editors coming to all consoles and stuff.

02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:42.960
And they have a new episode in there as well.

02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:43.280
Nice.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:44.240
Yeah.

02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:48.960
My final thought tonight is speaking of streaming.

02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:51.360
I am finally coming back to streaming tomorrow night.

02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:56.080
Usually after post-DragonCon, I'm really high on the streaming train.

02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:59.120
I'm like, I'm super motivated to do stuff and create content.

02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:00.800
And then COVID said, ha.

02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:04.000
So I've been out of it for a couple of weeks.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:04.960
I'm way overdue.

02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:09.200
I'm literally two weeks later and I wanted to be on this, but I will finally be streaming

02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:11.280
again tomorrow night after work.

02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:12.880
So please look forward to that.

02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:14.960
I will be doing some Final Fantasy 14 tomorrow.

02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:18.240
I'm actually thinking I'm going to have a schedule this week.

02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:23.920
And so as of right now, I'm going to do Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and I will be doing Final

02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:25.680
Fantasy 14 tomorrow.

02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:27.920
I think dead by daylight on Friday.

02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:31.440
And it's up in the air on what I'm going to do Wednesday, but something outside my normal

02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:31.760
realm.

02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:34.000
I might actually do Assassin's Creed Odyssey on Wednesday.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:39.040
So check that out over at my Twitch over at Rob Roberts.

02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:42.400
Tiger Claw says I'm still positive and haven't been able to go back to work.

02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:43.040
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:43.920
Feel better.

02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:46.400
I hope it took me 11 days to test negative.

02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:49.360
I've heard it takes some people a little longer.

02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:51.600
So just crossing my fingers for you, Tiger Claw.

02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:52.400
I know it's no fun.

02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:54.720
Be safe out there, everyone.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:56.560
