39680	43780	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
43780	46060	where every gamer has a voice.
46060	53780	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 929 of our
53780	58400	show for tonight, September the 11th of 2022.
58400	63520	My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined each week here to talk about video games, gaming
63520	68900	culture, the gamer lifestyle with my friends, although sadly not Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers
68900	73980	tonight she has the night off, I'm just going to be real with everyone, it's been a week
73980	78900	trademark patent pending and so it's kind of a miracle that we're here doing a show
78900	84900	tonight but a nobody loves to miss two weeks of shows that's you know what's the secret
84900	89180	of doing a podcast for over 20 years make sure you stay regular right although I'm sure
89180	92140	everyone would have understood if we took another week off and I'm going to get into
92140	98140	why in a little bit we kind of push forward with tonight however Dark Sakura she is still
98140	102580	recovering from some under the weather stuff and it affects her voice so she's actually
102580	107840	not even doing really her personal streams she just is resting her voice and not talking
107840	111580	right now to make sure she fully recovers so obviously doing this show would be very
111580	116540	difficult in line with that vision so she has the night off so she can rest however
116540	123000	joining me tonight as he does usually do say hello to Loki hi Loki hello how are you doing
123000	129520	Loki I'm doing okay I guess yeah it's it's been a week for me and it's been a week for
129520	134880	you so my voice is a little off because I think many of you have already seen this on
134880	141900	like Twitter and social media I got COVID so I'm recovering and this you might be going
141900	147740	wait a minute didn't you already have COVID yeah I did about six or seven weeks ago I
147740	153380	already had COVID the first time so I had COVID for the second time and this time was
153380	158660	much worse it was very clearly a different variant because the symptoms were very very
158660	163940	different so if my voice does sound a little bit like like sultry smoker voice not that
163940	168160	I want to glamorize smoking here in the year 2022 but there was a time in my life when
168160	172340	I you know would go see the Rocky Horror Picture Show and smoke clothes behind the theater
172340	177540	I quit a long time ago thank you but my voice is getting back into that range right now
177540	183180	so if my voice does sound off that's what's going on so it's both Dark Sakura and I dealing
183180	188740	with illness issues but I I feel well enough voice wise to do the show and I'm also kind
188740	195120	of like I kind of I need to do OLR like after this week I've I've literally gotten to do
195120	199940	nothing I enjoy this entire week Dragon Con was great and I'll get into that in a minute
199940	204760	but I've gotten to do nothing I enjoy this week I always come back from Dragon Con extremely
204760	212480	motivated to make content and do stuff and this COVID put the brakes on all of that so
212480	216880	that's kind of been a bummer so I'm really glad to be back here doing OLR with you and
216880	222520	thank you for the kind words over at twitch.tv slash vog network because we do tape live
222520	226260	every Sunday night at nine o'clock eastern six o'clock pacific right after the Bobby
226260	231880	Black Wolf show at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network that's vog network
231880	235880	and you can comment along with the show first off I want to acknowledge there's a hype train
235880	239580	going on in chat right now thank you so much for that you guys don't have to support like
239580	243340	that but you do and just I want to say I really appreciate that we will read all of those
243340	247620	donations at the end of tonight's show after we're done I'm recording the podcast because
247620	252200	this is also a podcast of course that you can get an iTunes Spotify you know all the
252200	257560	all the places that most people listen to podcasts some of the comments in chat my deaf
257560	262120	says you sound a bit off but not bad thank you dark to see it says yeah I notice it but
262120	266200	yeah it's fine yeah so I do I want people to know if my voice sounds different tonight
266200	270600	it's not like something in the podcast or it's just the fact that I'm recovering from
270600	278720	from COVID again um Loki you've also had quite a bit of a week I want to give you the space
278720	283300	to talk we will talk about video games uh and I know video games probably for both of
283300	287740	us have been a great and needed distraction this entire week um but I want to give you
287740	291980	some space to talk about your week as well Loki if you want to tell us better let's talk
291980	305420	about my week so um let's see so last Sunday um my mom passed away so she had like like
305420	311560	when I picture like the worst case scenario as far as like how I look at my life as far
311560	318960	as like uh work sucks you know then you retire and then like then um you know you have that
318960	324200	time to like do whatever you want well so basically she retired last year and you know
324200	331160	she was looking to enjoy her retirement uh come around New Year's I think it's like shortly
331160	339760	after the first like shortly around New Year's time she got a minor stroke so obviously there
339840	346960	is something going on um so it wasn't too impactful she like lost a tiny bit of her
346960	353880	vision but for the most part was just normal um then they were trying to investigate like
353880	359960	some heart valve issue that she had um that they thought might have been causing the leaking like
359960	365440	causing clots because it was leaking or something like that um in March she had a full-blown stroke
365520	375000	which caused her um to lose more vision to lose the ability to speak clearly I guess it's basically
375000	381800	here speech center so the best you could do was like one or two words and a lot of times those
381800	387240	words would be the wrong words coming out um she could understand just fine but she couldn't like
387240	394240	really talk clearly and it was also like very very mumbly you know very quiet like strained almost to
394240	402200	talk um so then they kept pushing back her heart surgery because she obviously had the strokes and
402200	407200	they have her on blood thinners and like we're getting all that so in July she finally has her
407200	414120	valve replacement surgery and everything seemed like okay we're gonna finally address the source
414120	421600	of the clotting oh and also before that they had she had like fibroids that they thought may have
421600	426240	been cancerous but they weren't able to kind of like tell if they were or not there it was
426240	431480	inconclusive if it was or not um so that was another thing that she would have had to have
431480	436240	a hysterectomy to address that as well as they were assuming that it was cancerous but they
436240	444760	weren't sure so anyways valve replacement surgery she's in the ICU for a while and it doesn't seem
444760	452000	to be she's having clotting issues now so she's losing blood flow to her hands and her feet and
452000	458840	tissues starting to die so like her fingertips are starting to go black and wither away her
458840	463800	toes are starting to do that as well so come to find out originally they thought it was an allergic
463800	470600	reaction to heparin which is a blood thinner but after doing different tests and after like
470600	477000	basically trying to treat everything they can they came up with the diagnosis that it's catastrophic
477000	486520	APS syndrome or anti let me pronounce this here antiphospholipid syndrome which is basically a
486520	496040	catastrophic means it's it's horrible it's very rare to have it that strong it's like one in
496040	501720	a hundred thousand or something like that and it's basically the immune system mistakenly attacks
501720	509200	the proteins in the blood causing clots everywhere so she was basically clotting her veins her
509200	516520	arteries organs everything which is extremely painful for her you know extremities and all
516520	528680	that stuff so fast forward now to gosh it was two weeks ago Monday so the beginning yeah the
528680	534400	beginning of the week from Sunday when she passed so Monday we had a meeting with the doctors and
534400	539120	the whole like nursing team and they basically said there's nothing we can do for her she's
539120	545680	dying so the start off the week I had to tell her because they aren't gonna do it I had to tell her
545680	550360	that she's dying so that was fun to have a conversation with somebody to let her down she
550360	556400	knew she knew what was going on you know obviously she was worried the entire time she wanted to go
556400	562080	home she didn't want to be you thought she was in the ICU for I think three to four weeks so which
562080	568120	is coming out of surgery you're supposed to be there for a couple days and that's it so clearly
568120	575400	knew what that something wasn't up and mean during that time it's possible like she was sleeping a
575400	581840	lot it's possible that she could have had other strokes we don't know but anyways she finally got
581840	589280	released into hospice care which is basically end-of-life care to us so we had her she was sent
589280	601400	to her home to basically pass away to die so we brought her home on Thursday and then she was you
601400	607760	know it look she was still with it like on Friday and stuff like that and you know able to
607760	612680	communicate it seemed like you know she was comfortable and everything but it just it
612680	620080	progressed pretty fast you know we weren't able to you know keep her as comfortable we kept having
620080	625400	the up the morphine and stuff thankfully though because of them it's a horrible syndrome to die
625400	631600	from incredibly painful I can only imagine how scared she was but she was really out of it with
631600	637640	the Ativan and morphine that they were giving her or we were giving her so thankfully I don't think
637640	645120	she was really lucid but yeah so she passed away Sunday morning ironically enough my in-laws were
645120	651240	coming to visit and when I first got there Sunday morning I could tell like I could hear her
651240	656080	breathing she had the they called the rattles it's basically you lose the ability to swallow
656080	665240	and it's kind of like snoring I guess sort of it's horrible sounding but she was like very loud
665240	671320	when I got there and then like I remember like as the morning went on I was like yeah she seems to
671320	676000	be getting quieter now like I don't know maybe she's starting to pass or whatever and so I had
676000	680600	checked on her and she was I mean at that point she wasn't waking like opening her eyes at all
680600	687120	anymore for like the last 12 hours or whatever and then so by the time my in-laws came to visit
687120	695520	when we went back to the room she had passed already so very sad you know it's it wasn't as
695520	704120	hard like honestly to see her like pass away it's just knowing how much she suffered for the last
704120	713600	like gosh months so it was kind of a relief yeah that but yeah it sucks there's there's a lot
713600	720200	there's a lot of parallels from you know what I went through five years ago as well so I'm not
720200	724160	saying that in a way to make it about me but I'm saying that in a way where it's like I I can really
724160	730040	relate to like you know a lot of what I'm hearing and and so forth and just you know I encourage
730040	734080	you to look at chat right now there's a lot of love from a lot of people in our chat room right
734080	740480	now sending their regards and well-races and you're you're absolutely on you're absolutely
740480	745960	right about a couple things one she already knew she was gonna pass away like you weren't right
745960	750680	you weren't really breaking that news you were just probably giving her confidence in what she
750680	757300	already knew and you're you're right she's no longer having to suffer or anything so all the
757300	761960	decisions you all made were correct and it was tough like because we had to go visit her in the
761960	766600	hospital like we divide our time between myself and my sister to go visit her each day in the
766600	771960	hospital and it's just it's hard to see her like that it's just constantly like she's you know
771960	777240	looking at her fingers who I mean at the very least they thought okay you know if they can get
777240	782360	the clotting under control it may be that she loses her fingertips but she's able to you know
782360	790080	live a normal life and and it honestly if that's all it was it I mean it sounds horrible because
790080	794040	they're like even like I'm like do you have to amputate that oh no I'll just fall off like an
794040	801600	umbilical cord I'm like that's horrifying but they like if that's all it was because it was
801600	806320	under her non-dominant hand too that wouldn't be so bad I mean that would suck but it wouldn't be
806320	814080	so bad but yeah it was just unfortunate it sucks because like you know I'm looking forward to
814080	820520	retirement because I hate my job so it's like this is this is a potential outcome that sucks
820520	829680	well it it emphasizes also the very important this is why we have to do things now you know
829680	836240	we have to enjoy all the time that we have now because even getting to 65 and retirement is
836240	843600	never guaranteed yeah yeah it was only 67 is what yeah she wasn't so yeah yeah it's hard to
843640	847960	say I mean you never know you'd be like you can plan for an amazing retirement you still want to
847960	854000	take full advantage of your 30s 40s 50s and so on don't be a workaholic and not take advantage
854000	859800	of those fun things now of course yeah don't kill yourself over your job yeah uh but yeah it's it's
859800	867000	it's sad but at the same time it's like it's I mean I was expecting this outcome right weeks
867040	874760	ago so it wasn't wasn't unknown and like even like during like last week in this week it's just been
874760	881800	like trying to just get back to normal as quickly as possible just not worry about not focus on it
881800	887640	too much you know it's so it's it's been for the most part pretty okay well I haven't been too
887640	893800	upset about it but yeah it's hard to talk about every now and then but I mean at least she's not
893840	899960	suffering anymore so there's that well well thank you for sharing Loki I know I know it's a
899960	904120	difficult story to share but I think there's a lot you know I definitely identify with a lot of what
904120	909400	you're sharing and I think there's a lot of people in chat that this is hitting home for I think a
909400	916000	lot of us too many of us in the past few years have joined the lost parent or parents club and
916000	923200	there's a lot a lot a lot of hugs going around and chat and the family for you so yeah now we're
923240	930800	so worried about our grand my grandfather because he's 96 mm-hmm oh it's like yeah that's a matter
930800	936240	of time like cuz yeah she had lost her mom literally last year like almost a year you
936240	942760	know ago so yeah that was hard for her too and it's gotta be I can only imagine when he's going
942760	948920	through to losing his wife and then losing his daughter like that yeah I can't imagine well you
948920	954520	know in in big world news this week of course we know the Queen passed away and she was 96 you
954520	961480	know and there's a lot of kind of III obviously there her being a big political figure there's a
961480	965400	lot of takes all over this it which is interesting because she actually has nothing to do with
965400	970280	politics as I understand it she's more of a figurehead but there's way too many opinions
970280	977560	on a British monarch in America which is strange to me but I I'm gonna digress it's one of those
977560	984960	things where I think a lot of people kind of look at that and go well I mean she's she's 96
984960	990440	let her go quietly and without all this pomp and circumstance and the big deal that people are
990440	994920	making it out to be but I get that she's a different you know type of figure 96 is still
994920	1000720	an incredible run you know and people are making all of these comparisons to oh she you know she
1000720	1004620	was around for this and this and this that happened at the toy she's she's as old as sliced
1004620	1008060	bread and all the same stuff they were saying about Betty White over here who was basically
1008060	1015460	the Queen of America so you know it's um you know 96 is an incredible run but my grandma made it to
1015460	1023300	99 so you know there might still be a few a few years to go and so many many get past 100 even
1023300	1033380	so yeah yep um so I guess speaking of enjoying things in the moment and doing things while you
1033500	1039940	can let's talk about my week two so I went to Dragon Con and that's why I missed last show I've
1039940	1046540	been going to Dragon Con for the past God since 20 2013 was my first Dragon Con so this would have
1046540	1051900	been basically my ninth because technically 2020 I don't count that one yes I know there was a
1051900	1056620	virtual year and many people still count that for their streak I don't this was the ninth year for
1056860	1067020	me so I would say nine Dragon Cons and one virtual Dragon Con so I went and I had a great honestly
1067020	1072580	I had a really good time this year the panels I got to host I had some really good ones and some
1072580	1078580	really good experiences Loki I got to do that Red Dead Redemption actors panel which is important
1078580	1082980	because they're not voice actors and everything in the promo said they were voice actors they
1082980	1087100	were voice and performance so they're really performance actors and we actually talked a
1087100	1091860	little bit about at the panel about kind of the difference and that's not it was never a discussion
1091860	1096540	about minimizing the importance of voice actors just pointing out that they're different art
1096540	1102100	forms right just like you can you can paint with watercolor you can paint with oil right it's it's
1102100	1107740	just different ways of making art so we talked a lot about the performance capture element of it
1107740	1112500	and kind of what made that difference over so they were they were a good group I was really happy and
1112540	1118340	honored to do that panel it was a Monday morning panel so it was not super well attended for a
1118340	1122340	ballroom panel but it still had a really good crowd there was somebody that came all the way
1122340	1127580	from China that asked a question and I was like wow that's pretty impressive so yeah it was um
1127580	1134300	it was a good panel I got to do on the video game track some discussions on diversity in games and
1134300	1139100	microtransactions in games sadly those panels weren't recorded so I don't think you'll see
1139100	1143180	them anywhere but they were they were a lot of fun to participate in and some really really good
1143180	1149260	points and things brought up I got to do a couple panels on the digital media track I got to do one
1149260	1153700	about streaming when you're over 40 years old and what was interesting about that that was an
1153700	1160780	interesting panel because we had some very very big name podcasters on that panel the macarons a
1160780	1165740	couple of the people from the family and they do my brother my brother and me I think is the name
1165740	1169260	of their big one and they have another big one that's D&D I think it's the whole family playing
1169260	1177100	D&D together some of that I I don't listen to a lot of stuff because I don't want to be influenced
1177100	1181620	the only shows I really listen to anymore are shows by drag queens and I can say the macarons
1181620	1186460	are not drag queens so they're just not in my wheelhouse for things I listen to because you
1186460	1191580	know there's a there's too many and B I don't want to be accidentally influenced or steal from
1191940	1200060	another show but I I know these folks have a huge following that room was completely full and they
1200060	1205580	had people outside in the hall watching the streaming together while it was streaming out
1205580	1211100	of the room because the room could only hold like maybe 80 people so it was very interesting to do a
1211100	1218180	panel for other people's fans but I thought it was a good discussion and I thought Bobby did a really
1218180	1223780	good job moderating it and I thought and I will say the macarons were you could very easily be a
1223780	1228740	diva in a situation like that and they absolutely weren't they shared the space equally with the
1228740	1232820	rest of us that were on the panel and I just I really appreciate that and that says speaks to a
1232820	1237820	very high level of professionalism from them one of them used to be with joystick the blog years
1237820	1244220	ago so they know gaming and I think they they know Bobby from different circles and maybe me I don't
1244220	1250980	know but yeah yeah Bobby says it was technically vogs panel Bobby Bobby Bobby yeah we were the
1250980	1256260	ones who submitted it but nobody was there to see us well maybe I got actually people did try to
1256260	1261700	come to see us because I did hear from several people that just didn't realize they would have
1261700	1270100	to get to that panel an hour beforehand to see us so not to say nobody was gonna but just really
1270100	1276060	underestimated the star power I guess that was on that panel so yeah technically it was submitted
1276060	1281140	by us but it was fun I it was a good panel it was recorded so you will be able to see that on
1281140	1288620	YouTube in a couple weeks when they put that online it's on their twitch channel as well I did
1288620	1296980	another panel which was about I don't remember in the moment what was it oh it was the it was the
1296980	1303860	video to it was the audio to video one that I that vog has done in years past but this year
1303860	1307660	somebody else did it and Bobby and I were just kind of experts on that panel or whatever you
1307660	1311660	want to call it that was a good panel to sadly I oh no that one was recorded so I'll be on YouTube
1311660	1316300	as well sorry sometimes it's hard to keep track what isn't what isn't recorded and then I got to
1316300	1320900	do a panel on the horror track I know that one was not recorded in any way there's only a few pictures
1320900	1325380	out there of that but that was one on horror no respect and that was a lot of fun and I was really
1325380	1329660	jazzed to get to do a panel on the horror track this year with more of the hosting stuff that I
1329660	1334660	do on the side growing and so forth so that was all great so yeah I met a lot of great people
1334660	1342500	professionally an incredible dragon con professionally an incredible dragon con and I
1342500	1348220	really see I I'm I don't want to say too much because I don't want to jinx anything but it
1348220	1353100	looks like 2023 may be an even bigger and better year and that is really really exciting and I'm
1353100	1359740	gonna cross my fingers and toes for all that stuff but then you know I was staying with Bobby
1359740	1365700	Black Wolf at Black Wolf Manor and Mrs. Black Wolf I was staying there Monday night I used to fly home
1365700	1370700	on Monday night Labor Day but then we kind of made it a tradition I think the first year was maybe
1370700	1377740	2018 I think that I actually went and I stayed at Bobby's place and it's just it's a nice way to
1377900	1383420	decompress I got to see their house I get to you know he has that very nice theater sometimes we'll
1383420	1387980	watch a movie or I'll play a game or you know I think we were watching a little bit of twitch
1387980	1391820	this year because I think Alan was broadcasting a little bit so we watched him on the the big
1391820	1397500	screen and you know he has his arcade and I'll talk a little bit about that and all that stuff
1397500	1403340	so it just you know it's just so it's a nice way to like decompress after the con and then get on
1403340	1409260	the flight on Tuesday which is the way to do it and because the airport's a lot less fucky on
1409260	1413580	Tuesday too that's the other important thing and the flights are a little bit cheaper so all that
1413580	1420300	stuff is very cool Tuesday morning I wake up and I have a pretty bad sore throat and I'm like uh-oh
1421180	1428780	uh-oh but I'm thinking well this can't be COVID because I just had COVID seven weeks ago like I
1428780	1434060	should have antibodies for at least two months I'm I'm good and this is probably you know what
1434060	1439580	I've been taken in the air it's different here it's probably a little bit of concrete because
1439580	1444780	I was around a bunch of people even though I was masked when I wasn't on a panel I wore my mask
1444780	1449820	more than most people did and so forth I'm like it's just it's whatever it's just a little thing
1449820	1456380	I caught picked up whatever and I guess I probably could have taken a test but at the same time what
1456380	1461020	would that have done I was not going to impose on Bobby Blackwolf and Mrs Blackwolf to stay at
1461020	1467660	their house for an additional 10 days and I was not you know really prepared for that sort of
1467660	1472700	thing um and I didn't have any reason to really think it was COVID so I and I had to get to the
1472700	1479980	airport because my flight was going to be leaving so I went to the airport and I flew home and as
1479980	1487420	the day went on my day was getting a lot worse and I started to feel sicker and sicker and sicker
1487420	1492140	and when I got home I immediately took I'm sorry for the um noise that went through in the
1492140	1496460	background there I thought I had my alerts turned off uh sorry about that that is not you it is me
1497020	1503740	um I was getting sicker sicker so I took a test and I got home and bam it's COVID and it's it's
1503740	1510220	like the last time I had it I had just like a breath of fate a hint of a line but it was a line
1510220	1519100	this time solid red you're fucked line just shows up on the test so I was like great I just flew
1519100	1526460	home and exposed how many people to COVID but here's the thing can I sit around and feel guilty
1526460	1532620	all day about that no I wore my mask very well the entire way home because I knew if nothing else I
1532620	1537260	probably had con crud and so forth so I'm like you know what I'm gonna wear my mask diligently
1537260	1546780	I maybe took it off twice for five seconds to take us a down water and shove a handful of
1546780	1553660	pretzels in my mouth and that was it now did the people around me wear masks on the flight no
1554460	1564060	nobody nobody there comes a point where I can't be responsible for other people
1564060	1569420	that know the risk and so forth I did everything I could whether I had COVID or not
1571260	1579020	um speaking of precautions and all of that I I'm not I'm definitely not
1579020	1586060	mad at dragon con or any of that because that would be messed up I'm a big boy and I know
1586060	1590060	that I was going to a convention that was going to be attended by many many people and that there
1590060	1597980	would be a risk of COVID I thought falsely that my recent COVID would have given me extra protection
1597980	1603180	but even going into it I knew well weird things happen people can still get it and very clearly
1603180	1611500	I got some other type of variant so I'm a I'm a big boy and I own the fact that I knew the risk
1611500	1618380	I went into this situation I'm not mad at anyone for the fact that I have COVID but but me however
1619020	1626620	I was disappointed that the masking policy and adherence was nothing like it was in 2021
1626620	1632460	in 2021 dragon con man everybody wore their masks and it was you know you people kept it on the
1632460	1638540	whole time the masking was very good everyone did their thing this year it all fell apart and
1638540	1644540	I would say in the hallways and walking around the convention maybe somewhere between 20 and 25 of
1644540	1650220	the people were wearing masks and in the panel rooms maybe a little more because uh people would
1650860	1655020	some of the door people going into some of the tracks and events were reminding people to put
1655020	1658940	their mask on and maybe something a little bit more about the enclosed spaces I don't know I
1658940	1665100	could theorize the whole day but the masking was not what it was in 2021 however my understanding
1665100	1674140	is dragon con put out their masking policy only to be followed up by the cdc a week later who the
1674140	1679820	cdc now comes in and says masking is optional so everybody comes to dragon con and wants to start
1679820	1684540	pitching a fit and they start pointing at the cdc thing and go but the cdc says masking is optional
1685420	1692060	volunteers of dragon con get sick of this fight after having to do it so many times
1692620	1700780	I don't blame the volunteers for dragon con for giving up at some point the people that are temps
1700780	1707660	working at the hotel also decide to stop giving up this fight because the hotels basically decide
1707660	1712700	why should we be the bad guy why should the Hyatt the Hilton the Marriott why should we be the bad
1712940	1718300	guy when dragon con can be the bad guy it's their policy so they give up enforcing it at some point
1719260	1725500	it all fell apart because literally everybody gave up and I still believe something I said
1725500	1732780	from the very beginning precautions work they worked in 2021 they worked at games done quick
1732780	1738460	and those stories you hear from Bobby Blackwolf they didn't work here because there were no
1738460	1747900	precautions taken and that is the fault of the dragon con attendees so shame on y'all
1748700	1757420	you messed up but the reality is is this dragon con is this something unique to dragon con is
1757420	1765100	this dragon con's fault is dragon con a super spreader event no and if you're one of those
1765100	1769260	people on twitter or you're on social media that's sitting there going well people that
1769260	1774300	went to dragon con they should they should know better they they were going to a super spreader
1774300	1777980	event they're gonna go home and they're gonna get their family sick and they should feel bad
1777980	1782380	these people going to dragon con you're stupid if you're going to dragon con I have two words for
1782380	1792620	you fuck off and I'm gonna tell you something that's very ugly but you need to hear it you're
1792620	1799660	on twitter talking to random people because you don't have friends in real life that you can talk
1799660	1806460	to because you've pushed them all away with your shitty fuck attitude I'm telling you that because
1806460	1812780	I care and that type of behavior on social media where you're literally taking pleasure in people
1812780	1825260	getting sick needs to stop shut the fuck up now some people are going to feel very attacked by
1825260	1831020	what I just said and I want to be very clear on something I am very I am only speaking to those
1831020	1837740	people that go on to twitter and start to yell all of this stuff at people because they're taking a
1837820	1843420	risk and they're taking a choice and they know and going into these situations hosting and all
1843420	1847420	of this stuff that I do and leading panels and moderating and all this stuff this is my job
1848700	1854300	it's not my day job but it's my night job and sometimes I don't like to talk about it but
1854300	1858940	sometimes it's a paid job stop attacking me for doing things I need to do for my job
1860060	1865820	I knew the risks I weighed the risks and I went into the situation now back to my earlier point
1866780	1870140	or actually no I want to make sure I clarify this too because otherwise people are gonna
1870140	1873020	get their panties and wad because they're gonna take what I said out of context
1874060	1879820	if you are choosing to sit home because you don't feel safe at dragon con or any of this other stuff
1880700	1888460	I support you that's your right go do it do what you need to do you know I I understand
1888460	1892140	this is why we still have a lot of virtual things that are available this is why
1892540	1896540	zoom is so much more a part of our culture now than it was a few years ago and so forth
1896540	1902300	you have the absolute right to make that choice and do what you need to do for yourself I support
1902300	1909820	that so please if you're in that crowd do not mistake what I just said which is again people
1909820	1916300	attacking others for doing what they need to do that's not the same thing I want to make sure
1916300	1921820	that is very very clear I respect anyone who didn't go to dragon con because they just felt
1922620	1924060	a risk they wanted to take that's fine
1928220	1932620	the reason why I say is it dragon con's fault is dragon con a super spreader event and all
1932620	1940060	this stuff and I say no is because let's be real if I hadn't gotten this at dragon con
1940060	1945420	because I didn't the first time I would have got it somewhere else like I did the first time
1946060	1950860	I would have got it at a restaurant I would have got it at work I would have got it at Costco
1950860	1956220	I would have got it at the grocery store I would have got it at the movies I would have got it
1956220	1963740	walking going on walks at the gym I would have got it into at one of hundreds of other places
1964700	1974860	because society has decided we're done with precautions and precautions work but without
1974860	1982620	precautions nothing works anymore that is society's fault not dragon cons dragon
1982620	1991100	con's just one part of society so I I so do I regret going to dragon con absolutely not
1992060	1999340	I'm disappointed and frustrated that a the the masking and all that stuff because again you can
1999340	2003980	say you can believe I can still say all of this that people should be able to take risk and go
2003980	2008460	into these situations do what they need to do for their jobs their careers their mental health
2008460	2014300	let people make that way decision and whatever they need to do I can say all that that is not
2014300	2019980	an anti-masking stance because I can say that and I can also say but we should still take precautions
2019980	2024140	like getting vaccinated wear your mask and do everything you need to do both of those things
2024140	2032300	in my head are true so that's that's what it is and unfortunately though the the cloth over people's
2032300	2037660	face has proven to be too much after two years and uh it is what it is it is what it is that's
2037660	2044060	that's society's problem to figure out why we we can't bring ourselves to do that after a few years
2044860	2050700	so uh getting some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network s2100 matt says people
2050700	2054700	need to understand that many folks are taking risks into their hands it's their choice and they
2054700	2059420	have their reasons mental health is a big reason many folks want to enjoy life the best way they
2059420	2067660	can in this situation yeah exactly exactly and you know what I know a lot of people that saw
2067660	2073180	lady gaga either this weekend within the week or last week you know how many people were at those
2073180	2080700	concerts more than were at dragon con now granted it was outdoors but you see how tight all those
2080700	2089660	people are sitting together it's a it's a risk and what and the reason why I said what I said
2089660	2094940	and I was really nasty to people that need to hear something nasty because their behavior it's
2094940	2100220	just a reflection of their behavior right now because there are so many of those people that
2100220	2106460	are attacking people on twitter making certain decisions and so all this stuff there are so many
2106460	2113260	people that say that stuff and then turn around and justify but I'm gonna I need to do this one
2113260	2124940	thing that's the behavior that pisses me off is that people will blame dragon con attendees
2124940	2130780	but then talk about their twitch con plans or their anime con plans or their packs plans or
2130780	2137340	whatever it is or their concert they're gonna go to or I can't miss this particular thing or
2137340	2143740	I've got this big family birthday party coming up or whatever it is like the hypocrisy smells it's
2143740	2151180	so bad anyway DJ Ramez says people also forget one thing we are still in a pandemic yes true
2152380	2158940	she-hulk 10 says it's scary especially long COVID absolutely and it sucks and I hope some of these
2158940	2166380	symptoms I'm not going to have for a long time but again this was something that is because of
2166380	2174460	the way society is right now in every place I was probably going to get it eventually well I did I
2174460	2180300	did and I did I did get it one time already the only thing that really sucks is the fact that I
2180300	2185500	know now that Alan got it too and at least you don't have kids because that's a whole other
2186140	2192620	entry vector oh god don't you want to talk about another thing but anyway great point
2194140	2198780	excuse me I will try to mute myself and not cough into the mic but I'm sure you all understand it
2198780	2207100	may happen tonight I got Alan sick we tried our best to distance at home stay apart and so forth
2207900	2214060	and of course I feel bad of course I don't I don't like that this has happened but Alan's
2214860	2220380	you know in in his typical graceful wonderful way has said you know what it's been 30 months
2220380	2225100	this is going to happen eventually and he has a very similar outlook I do if it didn't happen now
2225100	2231500	it was going to happen like you got it before and I didn't or you know when it was restaurant or the
2231500	2236860	gym or something else like this has got it was going to happen eventually so uh she-hulk 10
2236860	2243340	in chat says hopefully it will weaken like the flu and die out soon that's it it does seem to be
2244060	2251100	the way it's going I am not a scientist I can say what I had this last week sucked
2251100	2258460	it was bad it was worse than a cold it was worse than a sinus infection but it wasn't as bad as
2258460	2265420	swine flu I will say that so you might remember that was the thing that we here at OLRL got to
2265420	2269340	deal with about 10 years ago I know if longer than that probably 12 years it wasn't as bad
2269340	2279500	as swine flu in my opinion but it was up there all right um anyway I know I've said a lot and
2279500	2284540	like none of it has been about games but I think it was important to say and um you know if I if
2284540	2289580	I made you angry with something I said I just I just want you to stop and think about some of the
2289580	2293100	things that you say and you put out on social media and so forth and put yourself in other
2293100	2297900	people's shoes and again you have the right to make your own decisions on what is best for you
2297900	2306220	that is 100 understandable it is not okay for you to attack other people blame other people
2306220	2312300	or make people feel guilty because we're doing the things we need to do to keep our lives in
2312300	2321820	wellness and running and in good state getting covid is not a moral failing repeated after me
2321820	2325340	getting covid is not a moral failing
2327580	2336540	society our leaders had a chance to minimize and reduce this two years ago in 2012 really in 2019
2336540	2343900	and gone into 2020 we as a society and the leaders that lead us failed to do that we are now all
2343900	2354380	paying the price so if you want to blame something blame that uh looking at chat over at twitch.tv
2354380	2358460	slash vog network uh bobby blackwell says I respect everyone's risk tolerance and will no
2358460	2363740	longer try to pressure even if it's mock pressure people to come to conventions with vog yeah let
2363740	2370460	people know their options it's what it is uh yeah uh mike defton chat says I'm angry that people
2370460	2374780	don't actually listen yeah and uh dg ramas says I've been saying similar things for the last two
2374780	2381500	years on my podcast well if you think about it rama it's because we're both right all right I
2381500	2385900	had to sneak something out there all right let's actually get into some gaming news now that we're
2385900	2391420	what 45 minutes into the show uh hi dark soccer I see dark soccer joined the chat room so uh maybe
2391420	2398140	giving us some thoughts there uh virtually tonight so all right let's get into um excuse me some
2398140	2403580	actual gaming news uh loki you want to start us I have a lot of opinions on this too can't wait
2403580	2409980	you want to start us off with this yeah we can talk about this so um there was the whole d23
2409980	2416620	convention thing this week so there are lots of different announcements by disney regarding marvel
2416620	2424060	star wars lucas arts uh disney properties and different things with that so one of the
2424060	2431340	announcements was a brand new niantic game called marvel world of heroes that is supposed
2431340	2438620	to be coming out in 2023 they had a trailer for it and it looks generic af I don't even know what
2438620	2442940	the hell this is supposed to be but apparently you're supposed to be able to thwart crime take
2442940	2450940	on missions do nonsense I don't know and you team up with your friends as well as superheroes not
2450940	2456380	a single frame of game shown of course but this is as is tradition as is tradition for many of
2456380	2460140	these niantic announcements remember the very first pokemon go announcement did not have a
2460140	2465500	frame of gameplay in it I believe whenever it was they announced wizards unite although that was not
2465500	2470700	a niantic game that was um portkey games used in partnership with niantic using their stuff
2470700	2475180	um that I don't believe we saw a frame of footage in the launch trailer either so this is this is
2475180	2480620	par for the course so we know it's something to do with marvel superheroes and apparently in an
2480620	2487180	interview with one of the developers kind of gets into it's creating your own superhero which is I
2487180	2491180	guess somewhat of a first in these marvel games I didn't realize there were like no other marvel
2491180	2494860	games that you where you couldn't create your own hero um but I guess it also does kind of make
2494860	2500060	sense and it sounds like they're aiming for a very robust character creator that reflects you know
2500060	2506860	all the the spectrum of our society and all this stuff right now um so um I mean lego marvel
2506860	2512620	superheroes can create your own characters as well but yeah yeah okay well yeah so yeah I don't
2512620	2517500	but I I they were so I'm only saying that because it was in the interview or whatever they were
2517500	2522300	saying like oh well we're like the first so I don't I don't know what it is that they're they're
2522300	2527260	first thing but yeah there it is so and dark soccer is saying midnight suns and there was
2527260	2532380	another marvel phone game as well so some somebody over there is full of it or there's well there
2532380	2537660	there's one element of it that's new well midnight suns was it's going to be a brand new game but
2537660	2544300	like um there's yeah they have another like game coming out with um captain america and black
2544300	2549420	panther as well I'm not really sure that's all about but uh yeah this this I saw it I was like
2549420	2557500	cool except also like I don't know it's like doesn't there's so many niantic games that are
2557500	2562780	being announced and it's like will it really come out yeah we're seeing a lot of things we're not
2562780	2568300	seeing a lot of receipts for the announcements I think it's starting to to bug some people and I
2568300	2574460	get it how many games have they worked on that they just went eh well katan got cancelled we
2574460	2578060	know that one right it was being tested in australia new zealand and a couple other countries
2578060	2584300	as well and they they yanked it um so there's that oh questbusters clarifying in midnight sun
2584300	2590780	you can customize the hero but the hero is a new character created by marvel for the game
2590780	2594860	so that's the element because I believe in this one the hero is supposed to represent
2594860	2599980	you so you are this so I think that's what they're getting at but we're really getting into
2600940	2605020	weeds whatever like it doesn't matter as long as the game plays it doesn't it doesn't matter
2605020	2610860	it's the gameplay right it doesn't matter about the character so um although it would be nice if
2610860	2615020	all these this wide spectrum of society is something that is reflected in the game that's
2615020	2621340	great let me just put it this way now I take it's very easy you'll never recapture pokemon go
2621340	2627180	ever again you can try but it's never gonna happen again that lightning doesn't strike twice even
2627180	2632700	though you have thor but it's just it's never gonna happen I'm sorry you can throw whatever
2632700	2638220	property you want at this it's just not gonna happen um katan ever didn't happen transformers
2638220	2642700	but I believe that was also a third party making that in partnership with niantic that got cancelled
2642700	2648220	niantic laid off some of their staff we don't know why I suspect they were trying to push the
2648220	2654620	more google glass kind of ar gaming a little sooner maybe than it was ready um and maybe
2654620	2660220	that's but I I really don't know I can only speculate um but we also we know niantic has
2660220	2666540	announced recently a uh a game called peridot uh an original ip that we don't know anything about
2666540	2671180	yeah I'm more interested in something like that like I think honestly all these like
2672140	2678300	I mean pokemon was kind of a one-off but like it's just there's no property that really gets
2678300	2683420	me excited I love marvel stuff but like I am not excited at all about this and I get it I may not
2683420	2688460	be their target demographic although I don't know who would be then at that point but like it's just
2689980	2694380	I like the Pikmin game but I've talked about that a lot on the show and that is more I also
2695340	2700380	unlike you I have a default love for the ar and get outside and explore kind of games I've always
2700380	2706140	been a fan of niantic and that genre so that's you know that's it's obviously something um
2706780	2712860	something there um so uh what else do we know the nba game was announced that is coming but
2712860	2716860	we don't know much about that either so I think that's what the problem people are starting to
2716860	2720940	have when niantic is is that you're you're announcing too many things that either don't
2720940	2725980	come out or we don't know anything about it so niantic might want to re-examine their pipeline
2725980	2729900	from announcement to release because they've got too much now that they've announced that
2729900	2735740	they haven't released I get that they they made the announcement now because d23 so yeah that's
2735740	2739580	fine that makes sense it didn't it didn't have to be d23 it could have been any time
2740620	2747660	but here's here's why I think it's actually super newsworthy um is because when pokemon go came out
2748460	2754460	everybody tried to copy it and make their own type of pokemon go I don't think anyone was
2754460	2761180	successful at it what we had garfield go uh we had draconian go or whatever it was called
2761180	2766380	we had the jurassic park game which I feel like a couple people played that but I don't even think
2766380	2771740	that one's a big deal anymore and we just have seen that like in general other companies trying
2771740	2777980	to take on the strength of pokemon go wasn't working and I said from the very beginning it's
2777980	2784220	going to take a very strong ip to compete with pokemon go in fact I think the only company
2784220	2787100	that could really take on pokemon go would be disney
2789260	2796220	so the part of this news that strikes me as oh that's interesting is that disney isn't taking
2796220	2802700	it on they're partnering up so from my perspective whether you like it or not
2803340	2808540	niantic is now going to have the monopoly on these ar games for quite some time
2809500	2815900	until someone else can figure out a way to build a database of real world locations and collecting
2815900	2820860	this type of information that niantic is cleverly getting from their player base like portal scans
2820860	2825180	and pokestop scans and all this stuff that shows the stuff on the ground all this
2825180	2830540	unless another company can really think of a way to take that on in a way that niantic is now
2830540	2838220	already two or three steps ahead with this is this is like microsoft and game pass niantic is now
2838220	2844460	already three steps ahead of anyone else and this disney partnership now that there's nobody even
2844460	2851820	in the rearview mirror at this point so I that part to me is what's interesting is that yeah
2851820	2857020	disney just decided if he can't beat him join him mike defton chat says if you can't beat him
2857020	2861180	buy him I don't could could could disney buy niantic at this point I don't know
2861180	2865100	niantic may be too much money I I think they're worth a lot more than people think
2865900	2871580	but then again disney certainly has no shortage of money so I don't think disney wants to get
2871580	2878460	into gaming per se and they have lucasarts but like they're not really doing much with gaming
2878460	2883420	like it's very clearly they have no interest in making their own ar game so they are letting
2883420	2888140	niantic do it right so I don't think that they would purchase niantic I don't think they're it
2888140	2896060	yeah because for what yeah it like it would have to be like an amazing success like beyond pokemon
2896060	2904460	go to even drum up interest enough to do that yeah the the reason why someone will buy niantic
2904460	2912460	won't be the um games themselves it'll be the data niantic is amassing about the usage and
2912460	2917020	what the ground really looks like at some of those areas and stuff but that's that's the type of data
2917020	2921500	somebody's gonna want to buy from niantic at some point which is why niantic is kind of smart to
2921500	2924620	sort of license it in their own thing with the whole light shift but that's a whole
2925180	2931980	whole other thing anyway I think this is very interesting um again it's hard to say uh if the
2931980	2936380	game is going to be any good or not when we have literally not even seen one frame but just as
2936380	2941180	someone who's generally a fan usually of niantic stuff and I've talked at length about them on the
2941180	2947900	show um I wish them well I want to see it be good um good luck I can't wait to actually get my hands
2947900	2952780	on it hopefully so all right let's talk about the things we have gotten our hands on in this past
2952780	2958860	week let's talk about our gaming weeks I know I've had a lot low-key what about your gaming week what
2958860	2965100	do you mean it's all been minecraft I've been working on a single build for about a month now
2965100	2973260	designing it so it's now being it's done being designed it's probably going to be the largest
2973260	2979580	thing I've ever built I think you're gonna like it you just had something that you built that was
2979580	2985500	like the largest thing you ever built so you're one yeah that was yeah that was a mountain uh
2985500	2991580	a while back those 200,000 blocks I think this is like 300,000 at least it's very large it is
2991580	3000540	incredibly large but it it's pretty awesome it is mega man themed oh cool but it is it it is not my
3000540	3006060	mega base but it could it could have been my mega base if if I really wanted to be it's that big
3006060	3012140	but it is not a mega base it is just decoration the copper farm all right well everyone stay
3012220	3017580	tuned to Loki's uh youtube channel to uh check that out when it hits all right well as I've been
3017580	3023660	home sick and I I was I was supposed to go back to work Thursday obviously I didn't I've been home
3023660	3027180	pretty much sleeping and playing video games so I've had a lot uh and then of course there was
3027180	3030620	Dragon Con as well so pull up a chair I've got a few things to get into but I'll try to be quick
3031420	3036220	the game I've been playing most this week this week and weekend is Diablo 3 which I know is
3036220	3041260	kind of old but I've talked about it before I recently got back into it because I didn't really
3041260	3047660	care for Diablo Immortal um after the first 40 levels or so but um it made me realize I really
3047660	3054540	like Diablo 3 and I've been enjoying season 27 I'm up to Paragon 650 which is higher than I've
3054540	3062220	ever gotten Paragon wise Alan is up to 1200 uh in the season in the season not overall so uh
3062220	3065340	we've been both playing a lot of that game but it's been something we've been able to play
3065340	3070140	together which is cute so uh we've been having fun with that I have a wizard and I'm up to
3070140	3075020	greater rift level I think I cleared 90 earlier so I'm trying to work my way up into the hundreds
3075660	3082620	um I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14 Final Fantasy 14 right before I left for Dragon Con
3082620	3088460	released the new island sanctuary mode which is interesting because I know Disney also put out
3088460	3093900	their own Disney dream light which is kind of like this you know farming sim animal crossing sim sort
3093900	3098700	of game well they've also put something like this into Final Fantasy 14 with the island sanctuary
3098700	3105980	you go around and you gather materials you build things you then uh use the workshops to uh build
3105980	3111500	things you can export for items that you can then turn into cosmetic rewards like mounts and things
3111500	3116540	and all this stuff so you build up your island you can capture animals you keep them in a little part
3116540	3122220	of your sanctuary you grow plants so like it's got this whole little farm sim mode that's very
3122220	3127500	addicting in it right now that's been a lot of fun so I'm logging into that like every day to um
3127500	3132700	progress my island sanctuary so I don't raid my only savage content I do right now is savage
3132700	3136940	island sanctuary um and I've been having a lot of fun with that I've still been continuing in Dead
3136940	3142940	by Daylight as well uh they just released the project W or the um second Resident Evil pack
3142940	3148940	um which has made way too many Weskers in the killer pool um but he is an interesting killer and
3148940	3153980	uh you know very very hot like everybody from Resident Evil is so hot like I don't what what
3153980	3160700	is up like now I play Carlos super hot Ada Wong I also really hot like everybody is so hot from
3160700	3165660	Resident Evil um but I've been having fun playing the new characters um and just you know in general
3165660	3173260	leveling up um on the plane ride out to Dragon Con I played some Super Mario Brothers 2 on my Switch
3173260	3179420	because I was like I want to play a retro title and uh you know uh play something I can play start
3179420	3187900	to finish um on a plane ride so that's what I've been playing um then when I was at Dragon Con
3187900	3194780	Dragon Con had a whole little um they had two arcades they had a classic game room that was
3194780	3200460	also a bar and karaoke place and at the classic game room I got to play a bit of gyrus I actually
3200460	3205100	had the high score no I'm sorry the second high score on the gyrus machine for a hot minute because
3205100	3210060	I actually can still remember from the Commodore 64 days where the ship needs to be positioned in
3210060	3214620	the first few stages to get a perfect on everything so that's kind of fun I played some Street Fighter
3214620	3219260	2 with some friends that was very old school uh e Honda if you were wondering uh and then I played
3219260	3223340	some Mortal Kombat 2 as well so they had some great classic games and then I thought this was
3223340	3229980	really funny I watched my friend my friend saw this machine and he goes oh my god it's Galaga
3229980	3233820	I gotta go play Galaga I used to play so much Galaga when I was growing up and I was like
3234620	3240300	are you are you talking about Galaga he's he's like Galaga we always call the Galaga and I was
3240300	3246140	like I I think friend I think um I think it's Galaga because like galaxy it's galaxy if you're
3246140	3254860	in the galaxy it's Galaga what no it's it's Galaga and I was like okay well I watched him proceed to
3254860	3261100	get a very very large score on the Galaga machine so he was not just making this shit up he played
3261100	3265740	a lot of Galaga growing up and was still able to do very well for himself and it was the same thing
3266620	3273260	he knew everywhere you needed to be on the screen and so forth and all that stuff so dark soccer and
3273260	3279580	chat says you were always wrong here's the thing he's a friend I'd like him to stay my friend
3280300	3287020	is there hurting anything do I need to shit on his childhood no I I said what I needed to say oh
3287020	3292220	oh I thought it was Galaga like galaxy and he did acknowledge oh yeah you're probably right
3292220	3301020	and then continued to call it Galaga why why should I stop that what it's there's no harm in it
3301020	3309500	um and uh there was also a Japanese arcade so they used to have Tokyo Attack was the name of
3309500	3315740	the arcade but they Tokyo Attack went under for reasons and things um a couple years ago
3315820	3321980	so now there is a um a new company I think they're called Savepoint Arcade uh Bobby may have to
3321980	3326700	correct me on the name if I'm wrong but uh they were the ones that now come out and they brought
3326700	3333900	the Japanese like uh centered machines to the con and they had like a BeatMania 2DX Beastrover
3333900	3338060	I didn't realize they were gonna have freaking EMUs turned on or I would have turned on EMUs
3338060	3344060	so Bobby even got me some footage um of playing that game which he showed on his own show and
3344060	3349900	that was cool to play 2DX machine he they also had a BeatMania the final I hadn't seen one of
3349900	3357020	those machines since god did we go to like I think it was little Tokyo in LA was the last place I
3357020	3362140	ever saw one of those BeatMania the final machines so that was a trip to see that and I could not
3362140	3367500	remember how to play the songs uh on that game arcade infinity I think it's the last time I saw
3367500	3373020	that yeah yeah uh Bobby Blackwolf and chat says save point yes technically they aren't a new
3373020	3378300	company but they have stepped into the business that Tokyo Attack had okay awesome uh and then
3378300	3382700	the other game I got to play they had a lot more but the other game I actually played was Dance
3382700	3387500	Maniacs because you know if you've it's the one where you wave on the top and on the bottom and
3387500	3394460	it's a lot of fun and I miss that game so uh yeah I got to uh play a little bit of that so um Dark
3394460	3399260	Soccer I do not think this is the same group that does California Extreme because I I they're East
3399260	3403900	Coast based now granted if they're based in Maryland as Bobby says that is still quite the
3403900	3407980	trip uh but probably coming all the way out to the West Coast is even more of a trip there's
3407980	3411980	probably another company on the West Coast that does a lot of this stuff out here so um yeah and
3411980	3416780	if the 2DX machine was different then it probably wasn't the same group um but there's probably a
3416780	3421420	very similar group on the West Coast for sure um but getting over the Rockies with all those
3421420	3424700	machines is probably a big pain in the butt so you're probably always going to have your West
3424700	3428540	Coast and your East Coast and maybe maybe a Midwest company in there too who knows
3429500	3435660	um and then uh I I know the one you all want to hear about is uh the night I did stay at
3435660	3440540	Black Wolf Manor you know that Bobby Black Wolf has his own arcade right and he has his own
3440540	3448140	uh a few machines he has a Tron machine uh well these are these are um arcade one-ups like the one
3448140	3451580	the one behind me if you're watching live on Twitch if you're on the podcast feed you don't
3451580	3456460	see it but I have a Burger Time or a Data East arcade one-up replica cabinet
3456460	3464460	uh that sits behind me here um so uh Black Wolf has a Tron one and I joked and I said for some
3464460	3468460	time Bobby I'm coming over to your house I'm getting the high score on your Tron machine
3469020	3475820	and all I did all I did audience I did simply what I was going to say or what I said I was going to
3475820	3482540	do and I got the high score on his Tron machine with some practice it wasn't a great score so
3482540	3486220	with some practice Bobby will take it out in the next year and then he'll rub it in I'm sure and
3486220	3491580	it'll be fine I also played his Star Wars machine I did not get the high score on the Star Wars
3491580	3495260	machine I think if you wanted to get the high score on that machine you needed to start on
3495260	3501340	level nine and get the bonus for beating level nine I didn't do that so there was there was that
3502220	3507100	uh I also got to play pinball at Bobby's house Bobby has a Mandalorian machine which I think
3507100	3512620	he had last year because I remember playing that before um but he now has a Rush like the band a
3512620	3519180	Rush pinball table that was a lot of fun to play this was really cool I didn't know anything about
3519180	3525100	this until well it's like I heard here's the thing I'd heard of it and it's one thing to hear it
3525100	3530540	it's another thing to see it and do it and use it and this is the first time I used it
3530540	3537340	and that was Stern's QR code system they have now so they have this site that you can log into
3537820	3544380	uh with Stern pinball and you can actually scan a QR code on machines when you play them so it's
3544380	3550540	insider.sternpinball.com and there's this uh uh thing oh damn it I'm not logged in I was I was
3550540	3555820	going to show you the site otherwise um and you can log in a machine by scanning your QR code
3555820	3560380	and the really cool thing about that you get achievements and it tracks on your phone the
3560380	3565100	things you played and you have your own personal records and stuff like that and I think that is
3565100	3572460	brilliant because it brings something additional to pinball besides just pinball which is great
3572460	3578140	don't get me wrong but the thing with that is that you pay your dollar and you're done and you rarely
3578140	3582860	have anything to show for it it's like okay I had my little thrill for the experience I knocked some
3582860	3589340	balls around teehee and I'm done but now with this QR code thing if it's set up on the machine
3589340	3593340	not every Stern machine has them it's a separate thing they sell but Bobby Bobby put it on his
3593340	3598860	machines that he has with this QR code thing you scan the QR code thing and you get achievements
3598860	3604220	and you get to track your scores and all this really cool stuff so I played the rush table one
3604220	3609100	time and then Bobby told me about the QR code thing and I was like oh cool I gotta try that
3609100	3612940	and I'm like I want to get some achievements so let me try the rush table again I want to get some
3612940	3619980	achievements so I played the rush table again with my QR code and all this stuff and um balls
3619980	3627100	one and two didn't go so well ball three I went on a fucking bender on ball three I was alive for
3627100	3633100	a very long time on ball three and um I beat Bobby's high score on the rush machine too
3633100	3640540	oh that one I felt a little bad about because I didn't walk in there intending to do that
3644380	3648620	so I may or may not have gotten myself into a little hot water and there may or may not
3648620	3655180	literally be a sign outside of Bobby's arcade with my face on it at this point that says have
3655180	3661740	you seen this man or whatever it is and I just happen to have a shirt that day that said um
3662540	3664300	sorry I was mean to you on the internet
3666460	3672860	which I'd randomly bought at the mall uh a few weeks ago so I I said that so at that point I
3672860	3678300	wanted to play Mandalorian again I think I played it once just to like register that I'd played as
3678300	3684300	I was too afraid to do well on that machine because I don't want to make Bobby Blackwolf
3684300	3690140	cry like I don't want to make him cry like he's been very good you know what we have a good time
3690140	3695340	at Dragon Con we do some great business partner things together I got to watch him moderate some
3695340	3699820	awesome panels with the guys from Mortal Kombat and all this stuff he lets me stay at it I don't
3699820	3706700	want to make him cry so I had to I had to purposely kind of have a quick game of Mandalorian and let
3706700	3714700	that let that be that so luckily Mrs Blackwolf has already told me that she does not recognize
3714700	3719740	or authorize the ban or the signage that is outside the arcade so Mrs Blackwolf has
3719740	3728620	said I am welcome whenever I want so um Dark Soccer says Tron is at my house right now oh
3728620	3733580	the machine or the table because honestly I'd play either uh you probably don't want me coming over
3733580	3738780	right now uh but maybe in a week or so I'd love to come uh play that uh Dark Soccer says did my
3738780	3744620	friend Annie ever come by to say hi uh no I didn't I didn't meet any Annie so sorry to say but um
3745420	3750700	it there was no uh Dead by Daylight panels or anything like that so um I don't know if she's
3750700	3754780	your friend from that circle or somewhere else I don't know but um yeah didn't run into him
3754780	3760860	I will say one of the panels that we did was was the line capped an hour before the panel
3761420	3765820	and it seems like a lot of people who are trying to say hi to me or Bobby tried to come to that
3765820	3772620	panel uh and it was capped an hour beforehand because the Macarons were also on that so oh she
3772620	3777820	hosts some I heart podcast no I didn't see her sorry to say so um I guess there's always Dragon
3777820	3785100	Con 2023 because I I will be back I sure will I'm bummed that booster shot that's out there
3785100	3789180	now wasn't available two weeks sooner because I absolutely would have got it you know precautions
3789180	3796300	work but it is what it is when precautions are not followed here I am I follow them but everybody
3796300	3801740	has to follow them for them to work all right that's plenty enough about my gaming week oh I
3801740	3805420	should have mentioned the tilt five because Bobby did let me try that for the first time do you know
3805420	3813260	what the tilt five is Loki oh okay so long story short it's these glasses you wear and you stare
3813260	3818300	at this table thing it's they made it more for board games I think Bobby heard about it at Gen
3818300	3823500	Con but they have you know other like concept video games I I played a thing that was we'll
3823500	3827580	call it marble madness it wasn't actually marble madness but it was like a marble madness type of
3827580	3832460	thing or a monkey ball type of thing and you stare at this table and you see the image on
3832460	3836860	the table and as you look around it like moves with you and so forth because like it's like
3836860	3842060	projecting from the glasses onto this reflective material that's on the table and so it makes it
3842060	3848140	look like it's like um it's it's like a it's not VR it's a little more like AR but it's it's pretty
3848140	3854860	cool um till five is Jerry Ellsworth's AR goggles she was working on the valve cast AR before they
3854860	3860940	went VR that's Bobby's little summary there that was neat to see um but I didn't really get to
3860940	3866220	play any games on it it was just one concept demo so I'll be curious I watched Bobby do something
3866220	3870300	that looked a little Diablo-y to me and I was like what's that and he was uh because I guess
3870300	3874060	they had released some update and some new demos while we were at Dragon Con so he was kind of
3874060	3877900	trying them all for the first time so it feels like one of those things that still has a little
3877900	3881980	baking to do um so I'll be curious to see what kind of experiences they put on that that are
3881980	3887900	uniquely um for that tilt five okay now I have definitely talked too much about my gaming week
3887900	3895580	so let's get into some other gaming news uh let's get to it Loki yeah so there was also an Ubisoft
3895580	3903180	event where they talked about game announcements in a couple franchises um so some of the non
3903180	3909100	Ubisoft Assassin's Creed and Division announcements we had Mario and Rabbids
3909100	3915580	Sparks of Hope they showed off some more um a new trailer I think for that and that's set to come
3915580	3927340	out on the Switch October 20th and um also uh more on Skull and Bones still on its way um apparently
3927340	3933500	if uh you are part of Ubisoft's insider program uh you may be able to get a chance to play an early
3933500	3939660	version of the game uh Riders Republic is getting a season four update called Freestyling that
3939660	3946380	they're going to have um some skate parks and whatnot to actually be able to uh play in and
3946380	3954700	I think they're also adding BMX to that as well and I think that was oh um Netflix uh they're
3954700	3960700	going to be teaming up with them for a few different things I think Ubisoft related
3961340	3968060	I want to say they have an Assassin's Creed um game and tv show I'm not really sure what that's
3968060	3975260	about um Mighty Quest and Valiant Hearts 2 are I think mobile games that are going to be part of
3975260	3983180	Netflix's like gaming servicing that no one really cares about um Mythic Quest season three had a
3983180	3988460	uh trailer for that I can't believe that's on season three so that's I think still on Apple TV
3988700	3998380	um they talked about a free trial for Ubisoft Plus which is like a game pass on PC thing for
3998380	4002940	Ubisoft titles that's going to be um they're going to have a trail for that starting I think now it
4002940	4009420	runs until October 10th uh Trackmania a new version of that game is coming out supposed to
4009420	4013980	be free to play with no micro transactions so I'm not sure how they're making their money there
4013980	4017500	but there's going to be two premium tiers as well that you can buy into and they said the
4018380	4024460	seasonal updates every three months and that's supposed to be on all the modern consoles as well
4024460	4031660	uh Rocksmith Plus is like a I'm not sure if that's still going to be the similar I don't think
4032620	4036620	still have the accessories that go along with that but maybe a service that you can still learn how
4036620	4040860	to play the guitar and whatnot which is kind of cool uh new Just Dance game because of course
4041420	4049580	um and then a whole lot of Assassin's Creed whole lot Assassin's Creed so Assassin's Creed Mirage
4049580	4058300	which is the next big mainline game uh which is going to take place in um was it 9th century
4058300	4065100	Baghdad uh looks kind of cool they have an Assassin's Creed documentary talking about
4065100	4069340	the development of the game Assassin's Creed Valhalla is getting a last chapter for free
4070300	4076540	Assassin's Creed Codename Jade is going to be a mobile game that takes place in China in uh
4077180	4084060	215 BCE uh Assassin's Creed the the Netflix show we talked about a second ago they're
4084940	4091260	um not really sure what that's still going to be about but they're going to have a TV show as well
4092060	4097180	uh there is Assassin's Creed Codename Red which is supposed to take place in feudal Japan
4098140	4103660	Assassin's Creed Codename Hex which sort of has looks like the Blair Witch or something
4103660	4108460	something that has to do with witchcraft um and Assassin's Creed Infinity which is supposed to
4108460	4114060	somehow tie all this crap together this is what it sounds like when you're milking a franchise to
4114060	4120780	death so somebody has somebody has some lights to keep on over there good luck Ubisoft with that
4121580	4129180	Jesus Christ like um and then of course along with another franchise uh The Division so Tom Clancy's
4129180	4138380	The Division 2 um they're going to be doing like a new uh PvE mode and some other progression stuff
4139340	4144140	uh they said that there's supposed to be a season 10 with some quality life updates and
4144140	4149100	new difficulty modes and then season 11 is supposed to continue with the main story
4149820	4156620	uh Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland which is going to take place in middle America uh
4156620	4166220	there's also this Division Resurgence which is a mobile game uh that's going to be coming out
4166220	4171980	then Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Mobile also getting um you know obviously it's a mobile game as well
4171980	4179740	what else uh well we have some thoughts from chat uh Sia Tabiri says can I get an Assassin's Creed
4179740	4185180	that's set in the Edwardian area era excuse me and I'm actually just making clothes the entire time
4185980	4194380	don't encourage these people on further spin-offs because you joke but you know what why not a
4194380	4199500	farming sim set in the Assassin's Creed universe it's it's a cool new thing to do right now so
4199500	4206060	why not why not add clothes into that too Assassin's Creed My Little Cottage why not
4207580	4211580	you're also getting Assassin's Creed Symphonic Adventure which is a live concert
4212380	4220940	uh a podcast and a figurine who needs who needs a new podcast who needs any of those
4221900	4228940	I don't know like is there like I get it Assassin's Creed's a good it like I'm just
4228940	4233100	picturing for a second like if this was like Grand Theft Auto like if these were all like
4233100	4237420	Grand Theft Auto games that are being announced I would think that that's even too much like I'd be
4237420	4242380	like hold on like what the hell some of these sound cool like the Codename Red thing looks
4242380	4246220	cool but like that should be the game of the year you can't have like four four Assassin's
4246220	4250380	Creed games coming out at the same time like that is just ridiculous and I know these are
4250380	4256300	not all coming out the same time but like you know I don't need to know the 10 year
4256300	4260620	this is not the Marvel Cinematic Universe I don't need to know like the 10 mainline games
4260620	4267820	you have coming out for this series like just make a good game let's focus on the fruit in
4267820	4273740	the next game make it a good game please um going to an earlier comment in chat from I hope I don't
4273820	4278860	butcher this name Jess seven x uh in chat says will Beyond Good and Evil 2 ever come out
4280220	4285980	well you know it wasn't part of this so probably not you know what Dead Island 2 is apparently
4285980	4290380	finally happening so anything's possible um it ain't happening until it's actually out so
4291420	4295180	what's probably happening is that the fucking thing's getting delayed so much now they have
4295180	4299420	to re-scope it for a new console think about it when that game was first announced it was probably
4299420	4306940	being targeted for playstation 3 xbox 360 we're now on the playstation 5 and the xbox series x
4306940	4311580	like they're probably having to target that or maybe even beyond that at this point so it's
4311580	4316860	you know that that's probably what keeps pushing the thing back if you miss your target you can
4316860	4323340	really really miss your target and now you have to re-scope everything so so yeah but it's it's uh
4323340	4327660	I mean we haven't heard it's gotten cancelled but it could be one of those things where they're
4327660	4331980	basically gonna have to scrap it and start all over uh something more akin to what happened
4331980	4340220	with like final fantasy 15 duke nukem forever so you know let's see uh going to yeah quest buster
4340220	4346300	in chat says even as a ac I keep thinking animal crossing when I say ac which is funny but even as
4346300	4352540	an assassin's creed fan this seems like a lot of assassin's creed yes uh I guess the continues
4352540	4357980	quest buster I guess the uh ac version taking place in japan sounds cool right now but I'm
4357980	4362300	still thinking about ghost of Tsushima and how much more excited I am for an eventual sequel to
4362300	4370220	that uh ssho100 matt says eaves did an interview uh the ceo of ubisoft who you know we hate uh
4370220	4373660	where he basically strained himself patting himself on the back about the response of the
4373660	4378860	abuse scandal actual ubisoft employees are saying otherwise about said response actually happening
4379420	4385500	lift up those voices to make sure they catch the attention of the media and don't
4385500	4391340	let eaves gilmont drive that dialogue because that's exactly what he's trying to do with his
4391340	4397020	statements to the contrary so I hope uh the media will continue to report on what the workers are
4397020	4402940	actually saying about what's actually happening on that front which is not enough so uh eaves
4402940	4408060	gilmont probably needs to be removed as ceo already and if these 500 assassin's creed games
4408060	4412780	don't sell maybe that might finally happen although I somehow still still seem to doubt it
4412780	4418380	with um you know the amount of the stakeholder they have and all of that right pretty much yeah
4418380	4425580	yeah I can't imagine that'll happen all right um moving on to our next story uh it turns out that
4425580	4433260	facebook gaming is going to be losing their apps now I want to point out this doesn't mean that
4433260	4439580	it's been announced that facebook gaming is going away but this is how mixer started
4440860	4446620	the the beginning of the end basically um so facebook has sent out notifications to
4446620	4451900	partners that the apps will be shutting down in october and I guess one could argue youtube
4451980	4457180	gaming has also already done something similar and youtube gaming still has a presence so
4457740	4465180	it doesn't necessarily mean the end but it should be noted that facebook gaming has not really found
4465180	4470300	meaningful growth uh in game streaming the same way that um twitch and youtube have found those
4470300	4479260	things uh so yeah uh facebook gaming of course is run by meta uh they expanded even to irl streams
4479580	4485820	things like you know chatting art creation excel esports whatever uh they've got it on there uh
4485820	4492220	during the pandemic things like youtube and twitch have really gone up but facebook hasn't so much in
4492220	4498380	fact even facebook as a platform itself has seen declines in monthly active users earlier this year
4498940	4507020	and 20 of its share price uh was lost as a result so hmm so facebook gaming notified partners it is
4507020	4513260	going to be uh ending the mobile game streaming apps uh it is saying that they are continuing to
4513260	4518780	support game streaming within facebook itself but that doesn't mean that it's going to be something
4518780	4523420	they're going to continue to focus on or put a lot of money into and you might know that they've
4523420	4530140	put a lot of money into trying to get uh big talent over at um facebook gaming so
4530140	4536460	yeah it looks like it looks like it might be the beginning of the end for facebook gaming oh and
4536460	4541900	what's this in the article it looks like uh uh when reached out for comment uh rob roberts
4541900	4547020	from orange lounge radio the longest running podcast had the following to say about it
4547820	4555580	nah
4567020	4569580	i'm only petty sometimes
4570300	4577980	move but let's be real i hated the fact that facebook was getting into this space
4577980	4581980	i never liked them being in it and quite frankly i can't wait for them to get out
4583020	4589740	so sorry to my friends that use that platform to stream on stream on i don't want to say i told you
4589820	4590060	sell
4594060	4599340	have they tried like uh hot tub streams you know because i hear that this needs to be popular
4600540	4611420	low-key all right uh let's move on to uh our next story low-key uh this is funny this is a a
4611420	4622220	response um or the the playstation boss apparently calls out microsoft over um you know the inadequate
4622220	4628940	call of duty deal they're saying so you may remember that microsoft has committed that
4628940	4634380	call of duty is still going to be on the playstation platforms for now um at least you
4634380	4643420	know for at least several more years um but they're saying that um he basically said i
4643420	4647900	hadn't intended to comment on what i understand to be private business discussion but i feel
4647900	4652060	i need to set the record straight because phil spencer brought this into a public forum
4652700	4657660	throwing shade already um microsoft has only offered call of duty to remain on playstation
4657660	4663660	for three years after the current agreement between activision and sony ends after uh almost
4663660	4668220	20 years of call of duty on playstation their proposal was inadequate on many levels
4668220	4675180	and failed to take an account of the impact on our gamers we want to guarantee playstation gamers
4675180	4680060	continue to have the highest quality quality experience and microsoft's proposal undermines
4680060	4689420	this principle says the company or wasn't it sony or maybe i'm thinking maybe it was microsoft
4689420	4695820	somebody had like the tomb raider exclusive rights or would they do these timed things all the time
4695820	4702220	so that's like pot con that's the pot calling the kettle black at this point like microsoft sorry
4702220	4706940	like i don't microsoft had rise of the tomb raider for a year yeah yeah exactly but sony still has
4706940	4713340	final fantasy 7 remake exclusive exactly we haven't nailed that exactly and so and they've
4713340	4720860	had other exclusives before that as well um honestly like be glad they gave you three years dude
4722060	4727660	seriously like be glad they gave me look on one hand sony is just doing what they have to do from
4727660	4733260	a business sense like it right it would not be good business for them not to take a swing at it
4733260	4738300	you know however they feel the need to do it it doesn't make them right but i understand why they
4738300	4743740	have to say this stuff because you know legally it would they they are in the business of making
4743740	4749980	money and for them to roll over and you know have this franchise potentially leave them even in four
4749980	4755820	years with as much money as it makes is a big deal yeah it's what here's how it's gonna go down i
4755820	4763180	think is they'll keep it cross-platform for now on sony's platform until the playstation 6 whatever
4763180	4768300	the next xbox console gets announced and we're talking about new console launching and it's like
4768300	4772300	oh hey well if you won't play call of duty you got to come to this console now yeah that's how
4772300	4777500	it's going to go because um right now it is in their best interest to keep it multi-platform
4777500	4782060	because they're going to make a ton of money off of those users but later on when they were trying
4782060	4787980	to sway people to buy into an xbox console that's how you do it leverage with this stuff and i'm
4788060	4791340	sorry but like you can cry all about you want but you're doing the same thing so
4792780	4799020	i don't know whatever um sj100 matt chat says serious question if sony made this deal with abk
4799020	4804460	instead of microsoft would sony be as generous with microsoft or as this or would they pull it
4804460	4808220	from anything that's not pc or sony consoles they would have pulled it immediately you'll have a
4808220	4815980	chance to find out whenever destiny 3 happens so you know sony sony's been buying their own
4815980	4822220	companies lately too uh so you'll have a chance to find out if rumors are to be believed sony
4822220	4825980	will own square enix eventually i don't know how i don't know how much i believe that one but you
4825980	4832220	know anything is possible at this point so uh bobby blackwolf says sony will say we're not
4832220	4836220	doing the same thing with the top selling games in this country as what bobby says in chat so
4838060	4843740	yeah all right meanwhile anybody that's interested in playing any of these games
4844220	4850700	pc man you get sony games you get microsoft games you got everything yeah i mean i love
4850700	4856060	consoles still i do but you know there's lots of great if you but pc you just have to make sure
4856060	4860860	you have the the pc that can handle these newer games and that's not really in the realm of
4860860	4864780	affordability for a lot of people so there's definitely still a place for consoles for sure
4865900	4871340	um before i get into the next story i wanted to mention this comment on the last story about uh
4871340	4877580	facebook uh from uh sj100 matt who said uh zuckerberg uh couldn't be reached for comment
4877580	4885740	he was in his awkward metaverse that was that i don't how is any how is anybody supposed to
4885740	4890860	believe that the metaverse is the next big thing with those like it looks like something that
4890860	4895660	would have been at least clarified that that was an early screenshot and then they have better
4895660	4900460	stuff but like yeah it doesn't matter though because it's just uninteresting i don't care
4900460	4905740	if it's like super photorealistic it's still boring like it doesn't matter like what are you
4905740	4911660	doing with it like how how does this revolutionize anything other than it being a chat room that you
4911660	4917180	do unnecessary like you want me to go work there too yeah like no uh when pushed for further
4917180	4924860	comments zuckerberg also said solo sucks anyway um let's see also uh in chat uh metaverse bobby
4924860	4928540	blackwolf there's like three people that'll get that joke bobby blackwolf says playstation home
4928540	4933580	looked better than that metaverse yes sj100 matt says second life looks better than that metaverse
4933580	4939900	yes that's a lot of the big problem with it that's for sure all right going to this last story sorry
4939900	4944540	i'm getting the comments out of order but i'm reading as fast as i can um she-hole 10 i thought
4944540	4951420	had a great perspective here saying call of duty will have to replace a broken halo series 343
4951420	4956700	studios dropped the ball on halo yeah you know i have been hearing a lot of not great stuff out
4956700	4961660	of halo like the whole like uh split screen mode ended up getting cancelled and just like
4961660	4967820	they're not but you can glitch it back into the game somehow yeah that the the the road map and
4967820	4973260	and the the direction that halo reach has been going not where they hope that would be that's
4973260	4979340	for sure so that is very interesting what she-hole brings up though is that maybe microsoft needs a
4979340	4986220	shooter to fill a gap that their current shooter is is not filling for people very interesting
4986940	4995180	so yeah all right anyhow uh let's move on and talk about more news uh we were talking about
4995180	4999660	conventions earlier in the show and there's another one uh that was scheduled to come up
4999660	5005260	in january it's awesome games done quick uh but it will no longer be happening in person it was
5005260	5010300	going to be happening in florida but they announced this week that uh games done quick
5010300	5015180	uh the 2023 awesome games done quick event will be online it's going to be virtual again
5015180	5021180	january 8th through the 15th but here's the interesting thing they already had one of these
5021180	5028220	in person so it isn't covid directly that's responsible for the reason why they're shifting
5028220	5034140	this online however there's a couple reasons why they're shifting this online uh the organizers
5034140	5040380	want to return in person but in order to quote provide a safe and welcoming event to all they
5040380	5045420	need to move away from their plan location in florida in the statement they said given the
5045420	5053900	state's continued disregard for covid 19's dangers including anti-mandate policies and an increased
5053900	5060380	aggression towards lgbtq individuals including the law colloquially known as don't say gay
5060380	5067260	we do not believe it is a safe place for our community that is taking quite a stand on both
5067260	5073260	those fronts uh we know that florida has not exactly been the most covid precaution
5073260	5081660	encouraging state while i believe they could have a mask mandate in florida still on private
5081660	5085900	property at the hotel if the hotel and the convention could reach that agreement like
5085900	5090940	they did in minnesota for that event they just had over the summer i believe they cannot per
5090940	5097180	florida law mandate vaccination and i noticed they didn't call out masks in what they said they said
5098060	5104060	anti-mandate policies so they can't mandate that everybody has to be vaccinated and therefore
5104060	5110140	they're not willing to put people at risk so that's you know what it's it's about time florida
5110140	5114860	paid a price for some of these things that they keep you know it just sucks that it's a charity
5114860	5119660	event but the charity is still going to make money in the online form the charity i don't think will
5119660	5124380	lose anything out of this and you know we're going to get more speed runs submitted from around the
5124380	5128140	world because more people will be able to participate more people will be able to participate
5128140	5132620	virtually so i think that end of it in fact even when they did do it in person it was kind of cool
5132620	5136700	that they still had some stuff that was virtual so they could really get the best of both worlds
5136700	5141980	i think that's the that's the um marathon a lot of us would like to see because in person you get
5141980	5146860	the in-person reactions the in-person memes like there's a lot of guys i'm not saying it should
5146860	5153260	always be online i i love having a little bit of both but i i have to applaud games done quick for
5153260	5160620	taking a stand and even though they they really try not to be politically uh you know motivated
5160620	5164060	or whatever because you know people have their opinions all over the spectrum and what have you
5164060	5170060	the reality is lgbtq people there's a lot of them that volunteer and work with games done quick
5170060	5177100	and florida doesn't really feel like a safe space for folks right now so i understand why they did
5177100	5183900	it um so i mean the charity will still have it will still make money the event will still happen
5183900	5188380	it'll be online we'll miss the live reaction stuff and so forth but this is what they had to do to get
5188380	5193500	out of the car actually they can't get out of the contract but it's it's it's the easiest way to
5193500	5198220	remedy the situation we'll leave it at that right and it should be fine like it was fine the years
5198220	5202860	that they had to do it online anyways it wasn't like it was a worse event it was just different
5202860	5209340	so yep that is uh gonna be in january of 2022 bobby and chad is pointing out they are risking
5209340	5214540	bankruptcy by doing this um good point because even though it is a charity organization
5214540	5221260	um they are still an organization that has an income and an out outgoing funds and all that
5221260	5226940	stuff because um they you know they run their channel throughout the year that isn't necessarily
5226940	5231100	a charity fundraiser it helps them fund these different events and so forth so it's going to
5231260	5236300	different events and so forth so it is a company that puts on charity events there's kind of a
5236300	5242060	different sort of thing to it so they they could go bankrupt from this whole thing um
5243580	5251660	but i i i think it would be a really ugly look if the hotel sues this organization into oblivion
5251660	5257100	i i i'm you know it it is what it is we'll see what happens i realize business isn't always
5257100	5263740	nice or about the right thing um so we'll see what happens i wonder if and i bobby i have no
5263740	5268540	idea if you know this or not are they still sending a because i know when they when they
5268540	5277260	still do the virtual ones they send a skeleton crew to the site as basically the base of operations
5277820	5284540	so technically aren't they still for seeing their contract through by sending people to that hotel
5284540	5288540	as the base of operation of course i'm assuming they're still doing that maybe they're not even
5288540	5293580	going to do that because of the uh uh oh they do it from the virginia office says bobby they don't
5293580	5297260	go to the site they do it out of virginia all right then that answers that i thought they went
5297260	5305740	to the hotel and still did it there all right then all right uh let's move on with some more
5305740	5311740	stories loki what do you have for us yes so apparently twitch is permanently removing its
5311740	5319660	host mode on october 3rd um so apparently the hosting command and auto host features
5319660	5329260	will be gone which is really stupid um i don't yeah i'm not a fan they announced their change
5329260	5335820	in an update to their how to host or how to use host mode page uh saying that the experience
5335820	5343980	it delivers doesn't match their expectations when they come to twitch i i don't understand why you
5343980	5349900	would remove it like i don't see what the gain is i'm doing that i understand that there is confusion
5349900	5355900	between hosting and rating and that whole thing and it causes a little bit of like you know
5355900	5360860	confusion issues for especially for a newer streamer what do i do what's better and so forth
5360860	5366300	but um i think one of the big problems on twitch that everybody complains about
5366300	5371820	is discoverability and what's very interesting especially you know having sat on a few panels and
5371820	5376460	heard a lot of perspectives from this on the digital media track at dragon con this last week
5376460	5381340	it sounds like a platform that does discoverability very well is actually tik tok and i even think
5381340	5386220	about my own experiences with tik tok where i posted a random video that wasn't even funny
5386220	5392300	i have something like 750 views with no promotion so the discoverability on uh algorithm on tik tok
5392300	5398140	is pretty darn good the discoverability on twitch not the greatest usually the people that are on
5398140	5403340	the front page are already partners and it ends up being a rich get richer type of situation
5403980	5412460	so where hosting was good was that if i'm not live i could promote a channel in my place
5412460	5417260	basically on the main page in a little place that says hosting or you know channels being
5417260	5422780	hosted right now and something to keep in mind that i think even twitch forget sometimes is
5422780	5428940	there's a lot of us who still watch on playstation on xbox and so forth and there's a whole little
5428940	5434460	bar that shows the channels that are being hosted right now and i do look through that when none of
5434460	5439100	my friends are live or honestly none of my friends are playing anything i really want to see i'll go
5439100	5443580	look through the hosting and see well what's being hosted that might be interesting to look at
5443580	5449100	so i think where this is frustrating people is that they're taking discoverability away that's
5449100	5453900	what's happening and although twitch tries to say that well rating can take its place and so forth
5453900	5458940	i disagree because rating isn't something that's always there like for instance for us here at vog
5458940	5463980	network we used to say at the end of the show hey put us on your auto host list because there's a lot
5463980	5469580	of you that probably aren't live sunday night but by hosting us then we'll show up as a recommended
5469580	5475340	thing on your friends pages as something to check out that's why hosting is great rating doesn't do
5475340	5481900	any of that so there is a clear difference between those two things rating is a one-time thing hosting
5481900	5485180	is something that was kind of always there so i think that's why it's very frustrating that we're
5485180	5491020	losing it now if twitch were to turn around and say here's some discoverability we're going to
5491020	5496620	put in its place i think it would soften the blow a lot better yeah what they're discovered with
5496620	5503740	their um their suggestions are just give them a shout out to help them gain some followers send
5503740	5509500	your viewers to their channel at the end of your stream suggest channels for viewers to um to
5509500	5517980	viewers when you're offline yeah like that was we could already do that it's just i don't know um
5517980	5524940	yeah no i i agree now if only twitch had something very large planned for about the time that this
5524940	5530460	feature is sun setting to announce something new to enhance discoverability for our friends
5530460	5535500	if only they had a large convention with a keynote speech where they could announce something that
5535500	5541660	could really soften this blow a bit fingers and toes crossed well they said they're they're
5541660	5545980	reasoning for it they said that uh what viewers want to interact with the streamer when they're
5545980	5551020	live and host mode blocks us from happening preventing viewers from interacting with the
5551020	5556780	streamer they are watching also limits the streamer's growth potential um okay well then
5556780	5562780	don't do that like make it so that it auto like it kind of think of it instead of an auto host
5562780	5569500	it's a forwarder types of things you know what's it you know and it's like i do agree with you
5569500	5574220	loki but you know what's interesting i've got an interesting use case for you for why it should be
5574220	5580220	separate sometimes and that is what we do here at vog network for large events and we're going
5580220	5585820	to lose this because of this so for example when a microsoft keynote is going on if we're having
5585820	5593020	to work or something and bobby and myself or you jamie whoever is unavailable to do a simulcast
5593020	5599820	which we could still do we would usually host it and have our own chat that is a lot less
5599900	5604620	shit posted than the large chat that's happening during a microsoft or playstation event it's
5604620	5611020	just us in a chat watching the same event we could really benefit from that and many people
5611020	5615980	in chat are referencing that right now although bobby is also stating the reality i could honestly
5615980	5620700	count on one hand how many people participated yes that is the honest you know truth there
5620700	5627260	and we can still simulcast them as our schedules permit you know we so it says that the auto host
5627260	5632380	will be changed to suggested channels in your channel settings i don't know what that necessarily
5632380	5636700	means well i'll be curious to see what that looks like and how that might help lead to discovery
5636700	5641500	because maybe that won't be as bad as we think so we'll see we'll have to see what that looks like
5641500	5649820	in practice so yeah all right um let's move on we're going to uh go to a classic segment that
5649820	5655100	we do here on this show even though dark sakura is not here tonight we always have a plan b so
5655100	5670700	let's get to our next segment and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive
5670700	5676780	into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of
5676780	5682860	the week all right and dark soccer is not here tonight so i'm doing this segment instead tonight
5682860	5690060	but i did pull a page out of dark sakura's book and i picked a game that is 10 years old in this
5690060	5697100	last month and this is one you're probably going to be surprised rock band blitz is the classic
5697100	5705260	game of the week which was originally released on the playstation 3 august 28 2012 or on the xbox
5705260	5712620	360 august 29th of 2012 that's right this game just barely qualifies that it as it just turned
5712620	5716620	10 years old a couple of weeks ago and usually that's where we draw the line is that a classic
5716620	5721900	game of the week needs to be about 10 years old and mike defton chat over at uh twitch.tv slash
5721900	5726700	vlog network says i miss this game me too when i saw that this was on the lit because you know i
5726700	5730700	went over and i was like what games you know turned 10 recently and i saw this and i was like
5730700	5737420	no way not this game i loved this game in some ways i like this game even more than the rock band
5737420	5740940	games because you didn't need the plastic instruments to play it let's talk a little bit
5740940	5745420	about rock band blitz those of you that are watching live can see the footage here those
5745420	5750060	of you on the podcast i'll tell you a little bit about it and uh uh what we're seeing on the screen
5750060	5755420	here so this was a game that was released by harmonix in 2012 as i mentioned it was only an
5755420	5760300	online title so it was not something you could get retail uh it did not come with plastic instruments
5760300	5765820	it was meant to be played with a controller uh the gameplay mechanics were similar to other
5765820	5772140	harmonix titles that had been released prior including frequency amplitude and rock band
5772140	5778220	unplugged which i believe was the vita no the psp i think that one was on uh 25 songs came with
5778220	5786620	the game and the big clincher with this songs from any other version of the game that were exported or
5786620	5791660	downloaded as dlc or anything like that you could use all of it so that was what made this
5791660	5798060	game awesome is that you probably had thanks to rock band you had a library of tons of songs
5798060	5805180	all ready to go with this but here's the bummer about this game and i'm not sure somebody who
5805180	5811740	follows the wiki or either dark soccer herself may know better i don't know if we've had a game that
5811740	5821420	we've spotlit that you can literally no longer play today i mean i guess well i say that but
5821420	5826780	if you have it on your 360 now nobody uninstalled it through 360 but if you've never played this
5826780	5834300	game before there's no way for you to get it it was delisted on august 28th 2017 so five years ago
5834300	5838460	it was removed so on the five-year anniversary the game was removed and that was due to the music
5838460	5843100	license expirations so we have an interesting classic game where it's like if you don't have
5843100	5847660	this game there is no way for you to get it you're gonna have to find a friend that still
5847660	5856300	has it on their 360 or playstation um or um uh something else oh dark soccer suggests pt
5856300	5860220	she may have done at some point and that would be in a similar boat oh yeah i guess i guess
5860220	5866140	that is a very similar boat where it was also delisted so there is that so anyway uh rock band
5866140	5872380	blitz it's a note matching rhythm game again it's very similar designed a frequency amplitude rock
5872380	5879180	band unplugged you have five lanes that match lead guitar bass guitar drums vocals and keyboard
5879180	5884380	and they go through the different streets oh thanks orange right pt isn't 10 years old so
5884380	5891660	it couldn't have been done yet it's getting close though all right anyway um and uh there's only a
5891660	5895820	single difficulty level i think that's interesting because the rock band games had different uh
5895820	5900700	difficulty levels within the songs uh you can customize the controls but you use the buttons
5900700	5906380	on the gamepad to basically hop between different lanes and you score points for each note that you
5906380	5911420	get and once you get enough points in a lane you basically capture the lane and that lane auto
5911420	5917900	plays for a portion of the song uh when you build a blitz meter you move faster along the tracks
5917900	5923980	until you miss a few notes and you get a scoring bonus during that time once you complete a song
5923980	5929740	you are rated on a scale of one to five stars which is reflected of your total scores and
5929740	5936860	you're given both cred which unlocks power-ups and it reflects on your long-term performance
5937740	5944380	you get overdrive power-ups from the cred as you get white notes it fills the overdrive meter
5944380	5949660	you can then activate the overdrive power-up which is a two times scoring multiplier or you
5949660	5954860	can have the computer play one note for one track for you for a period of time or you can do a
5954860	5961020	bottle rocket which sends out a shock wave uh i guess an out of control car goes through the track
5961020	5967500	and it scores points for all the notes that are hit you also have note-based uh power-ups uh
5967500	5974460	where certain notes are marked purple and uh while you hit the notes uh you do the effects of that
5974460	5981180	power-up for example you can explode all notes on nearby tracks for points you can create a pinball
5981820	5987420	that while it hits different notes and you keep it in play it will score points that's pretty cool
5987420	5992460	and a sprite that moves between tracks that you try to catch to earn points and then lastly there
5992460	5996460	are track-based power-ups uh they're either active on different tracks during the song
5996460	6001340	that double the point values of a particular track or it's activated when you switch a track
6001340	6006140	or whatever so there's all these different things to do it also there was a facebook application for
6006140	6010620	this rock band world that could actually track online scoreboards so that way you can compete
6010620	6015420	with friends even between xbox and playstation platforms you also because it's all about the
6015420	6021660	sales would get recommended dlc uh through uh what your friends are playing and so forth so
6022860	6028940	the development of this game it was a departure from past rock band titles project director
6028940	6033900	matthew nordhaus referred to it as saying instead of having the focus on musical authenticity and
6033900	6039180	a performance simulation this is an arcade game it's fast loud silly and a little over the top
6041660	6047980	the game was originally called synchrony but then they changed it to rock band blitz uh and because
6047980	6052460	one of the power-ups was called the blitz and that's i guess what they they got it from uh
6052460	6057580	they did experiment with some other mechanics like having three notes per lane uh because i
6057580	6062540	believe there's only two in what was originally or what ended up being set up uh could you use
6062540	6068220	analog controls for vocal tracks uh and so forth so but they they kind of threw these out we got
6068220	6074300	we got what we got um they did experiment with instrument controls but ultimately found there
6074300	6079340	was no easy way to include them in the title and they realized this was going to be a single player
6079340	6083980	game but this is why they went to social elements like the facebook platform to kind of get that
6083980	6089740	simulation of playing and challenging other people uh they launched blitz with the rock
6089740	6095500	band world facebook application and then again it allowed you to compare your progress and so forth
6095500	6101020	so uh the game was originally premiered at the 2012 penny arcade expo east convention
6101020	6105420	uh i think that was one that i went to actually and it was shown to members of the press during
6105420	6111340	the game developers conference in 2012 uh at the end harmonix did say they would remove blitz from
6111340	6116540	playstation and xbox live due to the expiration of music licensing agreements uh they do not have
6116540	6120700	plans to make the games backwards compatible again probably because of those same licensing
6121420	6126620	issues and this game is not backwards compatible on either xbox or playstation platform at this
6126620	6134220	time and i don't know if it ever will be uh due to the music issues so um i would go over the list
6134220	6139820	but there's a lot a lot of songs in the list here so i'll just call out a few favorites you know i
6139820	6144780	love me some kelly clarkson so stronger was one of the songs that was in the game raise your glass
6144780	6151580	by pink moves like jagger which was all over the radio uh by maroon 5 uh was was in the game as
6151580	6156700	well and how about a queen song because we love queens so death on two legs uh was in the game
6156700	6162060	as well but that's just really just a small portion of the list uh rock band blitz got
6162060	6168140	generally a positive reception including a 77 on metacritic and a 76.9 on game rankings if you uh
6168140	6174140	care about that sort of stuff uh it was praised for the core gameplay and the leaderboards but
6174140	6180220	there was a criticism that it didn't really draw solo players uh that if you're not into high
6180220	6185580	scores there wasn't as much of a reason to do it uh it was called out that social hooks could have
6185580	6190620	been better implemented uh but if you have a large library of rock band tracks hey you're gonna have
6190620	6196220	a lot here for you so um that's pretty much all i have to say about it i spent a lot of hours on
6196220	6200540	this game i really like this game i think it really stinks that we don't have a backwards
6200540	6204940	compatible version of this game i wish they would release just the player for those of us that still
6204940	6209580	have a large library of rock band tracks maybe take out the music i understand why it's one of
6209580	6214220	those things that's easier said than done i just you know i thought this game was great and i
6214220	6219020	really would love to see harmonix visited again sometime even if i didn't love the amplitude
6219020	6223900	reboot that came after this but that's another story so there it is your classic game of the
6223900	6231500	week rock band blitz did you ever play rock band blitz loki uh i did when it first came out yeah
6231500	6237820	not very much yeah um i think i just downloaded because uh you know i played my full library of
6237820	6243900	rock band songs and i had a ton of songs so it made sense yeah um was it the opposite too because
6243900	6247900	i know like with a lot of those games you can kind of move them between different games like i know
6247900	6252860	with like rock band 2 you can import like yeah lego rock band and stuff like that all those songs
6252860	6258540	and mike def points out you could also export the rock band blitz songs and play them in the real
6258540	6262220	real rock band you know the main line i guess or whatever franchise that's what that's what
6262220	6267580	was worth it for a lot of those like i remember was it um i think it was like a rock band that had
6267580	6272940	uh like i had the tiger or something like that there was like one of those like i oh i got to
6272940	6278060	get those songs it was like lego lego rock band had a yeah yeah yeah so like it was it was worth
6278060	6282460	like just purchasing the game because i think it was like super cheap at one point just to get the
6282460	6287180	licensed songs so you can pull them in like regular rock bands so that's pretty cool all
6287180	6293340	right um we really just have a few more stories for you um i know that might seem kind of like
6293340	6298700	a surprise but um a there wasn't quite as much gaming news this week with the labor day holiday
6298700	6303900	and you know everything else going on and b i knew i probably wasn't gonna last a full three
6303900	6308140	hours tonight so we don't have quite as many stories slotted tonight um but i will encourage
6308140	6313340	you if you do want to call into the show uh you can join our green room over at vog network.com

6387020	6394860	a couple of times and uh played with gwen as finora and you took my place on a stream the
6394860	6401180	other night well i didn't realize that you were already playing when i reached out before so

6408060	6412860	i was really and i'm still not really but like it was one of those i could maybe do this for like 90
6412940	6417100	minutes and then dinner was coming in anyway so it was like all right i'm leaving and then
6417100	6420700	i left to go eat dinner when i came back i was like oh jamie took my place that's cute i love

6431660	6437500	of them yeah and they were increasingly drunk by the end of uh as is typical for friday night
6437500	6446700	streams yeah right um but man though the state of dbd right now is stinkier and stinkier and
6446700	6454860	stinkier and west career and west career well it's it's just like the camping has gotten worse
6454860	6465500	oh yeah it sure has no buena yeah um and um but i mean as far as like i still have a lot of fun

6623820	6630060	bye uh let's get into some rapid fire news we just have a couple stories for you and we'll
6630060	6638300	start with loki yep so uh this is kind of cool and uh basically you may remember there's been
6638300	6643500	a few games that they've done this where they've reverse engineered hobbyists have reverse
6643500	6649180	engineered a certain nintendo games not even necessarily just nintendo um because i remember
6649180	6653980	they did that with the i think it was like vice city or something like that for playstation but
6653980	6661500	anyways um so now they have reverse engineered the uh legend of zelda link to the past and they
6661500	6669660	have ported it to pc so it's running natively on pc now uh this is thanks to a github user snes rev
6670300	6676380	who has uh put together the code to do that now of course you have to have a legally obtained
6676380	6685500	version of the rom available and then using some uh python scripts you can convert it into an
6685500	6692460	executable for the pc uh it runs all right right now they don't it's like running but they don't
6692460	6698860	have like all of you know the fancy features like you know upscaling or uh full screen remappable
6698860	6704860	controls and that type of stuff yet but you know it's being worked on until it gets shut down by
6704860	6712700	nintendo so go download it while you can all right i have one quick story for you also out
6712700	6718700	of the d23 expo and that is that a new tron game is coming and you know this caught my attention
6718700	6724460	right it is a game called tron identity but it might not be what you think because this game is
6724460	6729420	apparently going to be more of a visual novel it's not going to feature anybody from the movies so
6729420	6733500	it's just kind of set in the tron universe but i'm actually like totally okay with that i actually
6733500	6737100	like that idea of trying to establish things that are independent from the movies because i
6737660	6742220	like the movies have been in development hell for you know we all have heard that there's that
6742220	6746060	mysterious third movie they're talking about making that jared letto may or may not be involved
6746060	6755100	with and i hope it's not um but regardless the the the tron um legacy was 2010 it's been 12 years
6755100	6758540	since that movie so like if a sequel is going to happen you would hope it would happen sooner
6758540	6764460	rather than later of course it took what 28 years the first time so oh so anyway i i like
6764460	6768620	that disney is trying to establish some tron things that are outside of the movie universe
6768620	6773260	so that maybe tron can continue and i'm still jazzed that they are opening a ride i think
6773260	6777500	they showed test footage of the ride today uh i think they said it's going to be early next year
6777500	6785500	i'd love to go to something like i was seeing uh because there's a few people on um on youtube that
6785500	6790700	i follow that do like the park you know like the pov park ride stuff yeah someone was saying like
6790700	6796300	the people movers are coming back because that's exciting news that is a huge rumor right now is
6796300	6801100	that people movers are coming back yeah i hope so i love it yeah i would love to see that too
6801100	6807980	but anyway uh tron identity is a game that is coming out um in 2023 and it is a visual novel
6807980	6812940	and puzzle game it's being developed by mike befell who made thomas was alone so that's a
6812940	6818220	pretty big resume item and the solitaire conspiracy uh in the game you will follow
6818220	6823740	query a detective program that is keeping the peace on an all new grid query is tasked with
6823740	6831020	unraveling a break-in and theft that occurred um you will advance the story by uh defragging other
6831020	6837260	programs identity disk um so once you defrag the disk you get to the path that shows the solution
6837260	6843500	for the unique puzzles uh it should be noted uh this is and what's interesting this article i'm
6843500	6851180	looking at says that tron is the first disney uh tron game for pc or console since tron 2.0
6851180	6857660	that is incorrect uh in 2004 there was a tron runner game that came out and i think that was
6857660	6864540	the name of it was tron run run are yeah so um how about that way to get way to do your job
6864540	6870380	gaming journalist uh no i'm just giving him shit there was that tron run our game that was out i
6870380	6877180	want to say that was around 20 it was a few years after the movie i want to say that 2015 2016
6877180	6883980	so it's it's been a little bit but yeah uh also um this is completely neglecting
6884540	6892780	the tron legacy uh xbox 360 and p um maybe that one wasn't on pc but i think it was
6893580	6899100	so they neglected that one too it was i think it was called just tron legacy but it was like
6899100	6905580	a tie-in game that was on like the 360 and playstation 3 yeah that was more of a traditional
6905580	6911820	adventure game so it's trying evolution try evolution thank you okay that's what it was
6912620	6918700	so there have been other tron games just so you know all right uh that's it for our rapid
6918700	6923820	fire news let's travel around the world and check out some release dates loki do me a solid
6923820	6929100	and do us and uk back to back if you can i have to take a restroom emergency i'm sorry i'll be back
6929100	6932940	okay and they did have a pc version of trial and evolution so i don't really know what they're
6932940	6940540	talking about they just didn't research enough what uh anyways so we have quite a few things
6940540	6950380	coming out this week we have freedom planet 2 on pc uh ice on nose or was it ice on zo
6950380	6956300	that's a weird name uh pc playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one xbox series a little

6965820	6974220	files they're finally getting an official game for that that's on pc sunday gold on pc as well

6990060	6997500	blind fate ito no yami on pc nintendo switch playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one and xbox
6997500	7005660	series despots game on pc mac and linux nintendo switch playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one and
7005660	7018620	xbox series dragon quest uh 10 offline fun fun name for that um that's on uh pc nintendo switch
7018620	7027180	playstation 4 and playstation 5 dungeons 3 on nintendo switch fairy fencer f refrain
7027180	7035340	cord on nintendo switch playstation 4 and playstation 5 vault stp light
7036780	7045340	crab i have no idea how you pronounce that that's on nintendo switch metal hell singer on pc
7045340	7054700	playstation 5 and xbox series uh the outer wilds coming to playstation 5 and xbox series sbk22
7055660	7063500	on pc playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one xbox series and last but not least
7063500	7072140	trinity trigger on nintendo switch playstation 4 and playstation 5 then in the uk we've got
7073020	7081900	uh looks like eizenzo uh deluxe edition and i guess that's a world war one game that's out on
7081900	7091100	playstation and xbox uh 13 also coming out on playstation xbox and the switch the alfred hitch
7091100	7101980	cock vertigo on playstation xbox and switch recompile on playstation uh let's see dungeons
7101980	7113420	3 on nintendo switch uh and then this is probably my favorite one for the week here yuppie psycho
7113420	7119500	executive edition on playstation and nintendo switch what the hell is that that sounds
7119500	7125420	incredible it looks like a visual novel probably of course i'm a japanese game and then uh under
7125420	7135100	knots labyrinth of yomi on the playstation we have arcade gettin on uh playstation and xbox
7136380	7146460	fell seal um arbiter's mark on playstation switch and pc and that's it all right
7146460	7154140	was that the uk and us that was uk and us all right let's go to japan and the big release this
7154140	7160060	week in japan i think uh on the nintendo switch this week is dragon quest 10 offline so this was
7160060	7165180	announced a little while ago where this is uh you know the version of dragon quest 10 uh where you
7165180	7169980	don't have to pay to do an mmo anymore um i hope i hope this gets localized for the us because we
7169980	7175020	never got to play dragon quest 10 in any capacity so we'll see uh a regular and deluxe edition are
7175020	7180140	bound for japan on the 15th uh we also have on the switch fairy fencer f refrain cord comes out
7180140	7187180	trinity trigger is also out and uh that is it for the switch if we go over to the playstation 5
7187180	7191580	uh dragon quest 10 offline is also released on the playstation on the playstation 5
7191580	7196380	uh fairy fencer f and trinity trigger also so i guess those are your big games but there's one
7196380	7203340	more on the playstation 5 and that is japan's release of destroy all humans 2 the reprobed
7203340	7209980	edition also in japan this week you can pick up a playstation 5 horizon forbidden west bundle uh
7209980	7217660	that is out in a uh regular and uh the digital edition of ps5 so um that is the version of the
7218220	7224140	that uh i guess just comes included with the game or so i guess the playstation itself doesn't look
7224140	7234620	any different so okay yeah that's weird all right i'm trying to see if maybe there's like a subtle
7234620	7238620	engraving or something on it because i when i saw it i assumed it was a limited release console but
7238620	7248060	i guess not all righty then all right uh let's move on with a couple more stories loki yes so
7248060	7258140	gamesop has been accused of wiretapping customers um and this is it's not as crazy as it sounds
7258140	7265580	so basically what it is they are not complying with the california's invasion of privacy act
7266700	7273180	which they can't basically website operators can't create transcripts of visitors conversations and
7273180	7280780	this is happening in their support chat is what's happening um they're saying that apparently the
7280780	7287020	company is uh taking secret transcripts of those wiretaps and they're sharing them with
7287020	7291100	a third party that helps them boost its ability to harvest personal data
7295980	7301980	but anyways so they do have a lawsuit though um that's basically saying that you know that
7301980	7306380	compliance with sipa is easy and the vast majority of companies comply with the law
7306380	7310700	by simply notifying website visitors if their conversations are being recorded
7310700	7315260	so you know how you you know hear those messages whenever you call an 800 number or something like
7315260	7322780	that that they're recorded for you know quality and training purposes which is which is you know
7322780	7328460	because i did work in a call center for a very long time many years ago and they you know uh we
7328460	7333260	would play the calls and training class absolutely that was something that we would do um to to learn
7333260	7339900	from them and so forth um but also yeah calls get randomly audited that's how uh companies make sure
7339900	7343500	because they i don't know how much i should say well i don't work there anymore and it's been a
7343500	7348700	long time but but they they found out that um some of the people working were um hanging up on
7348700	7352940	customers and they can only do that through the uh audit process so it's an important part to keep
7352940	7357900	the integrity of what's going on in this case they're saying that the uh that game stop is
7357900	7364380	allowing zendesk to intercept and use the transcripts from these well zendesk is apparently
7364380	7369820	a like ticketing system so i don't know how malicious it is that they're doing that but
7369820	7374700	at the very least they should probably be complying with the the sipa act um in order to
7375820	7381900	you know not getting hot water for this stuff but you know it seems benign to me it's not like a
7381900	7386940	like oh we're capturing all this data and we're selling it to you know advertisers and we're gonna
7386940	7394300	figure it out no i think it's it seems a little litigious um but
7396140	7406300	we'll see if anything comes of this i doubt it all right um let's move on into one more story for the
7406300	7414140	night um and it's a sad one uh we lost uh a gaming great this last week i think this is
7414140	7420460	actually the week we were out um but i'm gonna mention it anyway on august 30th uh the president
7420460	7427580	of miracle kids uh mitsuhiro yoshida passed away suddenly uh although you may not be familiar with
7427580	7434780	miracle kids with a z uh you would know mitsuhiro yoshida as uh one of the people uh that was on the
7434780	7442700	team at uh technos japan who created the series like river city ransom super dodgeball and nintendo
7442700	7448060	world cup these were all part of the kunio kun series and i believe there's even a compilation
7448060	7454140	of like kunio kun games that came out just within the past couple years miracle kids was made up
7454140	7459260	largely of former staff there and they even continued to produce titles in the kunio kun
7459260	7465420	series most of these are now owned by arc system works um so uh in a statement that was posted to
7465420	7470300	twitter uh mitsuhiro yoshida president of miracle kids and one of the key creative figures behind
7470300	7476380	classic kunio kun titles including nes super dodgeball and river city ransom passed away on
7476380	7481180	august 30th suddenly that's all they said was suddenly they didn't give any more details
7481180	7489180	but still what a um what a terrible loss uh for the industry um unfortunately these stories of
7489180	7495340	loss do not end there i would need to say something as well about um a very well-known
7495340	7500780	video game journalist who also passed away while we were out um on this last week and that was mike
7500780	7506380	fahey uh who is with kotaku oh wow and say which say what you oh you didn't hear about this no i
7506380	7511900	haven't heard about oh well you've been very busy paying attention to other things um no mike fahey
7511900	7518300	passed away um at 49 um he passed away on friday and uh you know he he was having some medical
7518300	7526700	problems over the past couple years um so uh he uh had a aortic dissection in 2018 that is where
7526700	7531820	the body kind of tear your main artery and it left him paralyzed and he was using a wheelchair
7531820	7536940	he had another one of these tears in april and a subsequent infection unfortunately was the cause
7536940	7543100	of death so it's a very very tragic um say what you will about kotaku over the years um and we've
7543100	7548860	said plenty um but uh mike fahey definitely seemed like he was always one of the good guys and um
7548860	7554060	you know i i there's not a lot i i did not have a lot of interactions with him so i can't say a lot
7554060	7560940	however i know um our pal bobby blackwolf who we work with here at vog was also in the atlanta area
7560940	7566540	where mike fahey was and has a lot more to say on his show this week and gives a much better tribute
7566540	7573660	so i would encourage you to listen to that show but um obviously um you know gaming journalism
7573660	7580140	of a certain area was absolutely in part shaped by mike fahey so that's a huge loss as well so
7580140	7584940	um sjo and her matt wants to point out kotaku had a very nice write-up with stories from various
7584940	7589340	people in the industry uh yeah i just saw that yeah dartesia says yeah i didn't know him but
7589340	7593980	damn if i didn't see his articles on kotaku mike def says mike fahey was one of the few people at
7593980	7601340	kotaku that was worth reading so um yeah so that's a very unfortunate uh loss as well in the industry
7601340	7608220	this week so all right well with that i'm going to try to move into our listener roundtable and
7608220	7615660	invite your calls over at the green room over at twitch.tv slash vog i'm sorry that's how to watch
7615660	7624380	our show live vog network.com slash discord uh is where you can uh tune in uh and join our uh
7624380	7630540	green room and uh oh i see somebody's already already jumping on the opportunity so let's get
7630540	7638060	to it well hello you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey hey hey it's the one and only
7638060	7643500	ron how is everybody doing tonight fabulous how are you it's so good to hear from you it's been
7643500	7653660	it's been a minute i'm doing good you know i over you look good well i i try i try i i discovered
7653660	7659180	something called the uh the rob roberts diet it's kind of similar to you know to to the richard
7659180	7663660	simmons diet it's been kind of working it's been kind of helping you know oh actually so like more
7663660	7669820	walking playing pikmin and that sort of thing it's it's more walking and drinking a lot more water
7669820	7676380	no it's good water's good and i i i love richard simmons i i take that as a an ultimate compliment
7676380	7681580	he's an amazing human being i could i could do an entire three hour talk on how richard simmons is
7681580	7685660	completely underappreciated and a gift we don't deserve but anyway i'll save that for another day
7686300	7689260	what's on your mind you didn't call it to talk about richard simmons what do you want to talk
7689260	7693980	about well things but before i continue i do want to say loki my deepest condolences
7694700	7697500	i i understand what you're going through and we got you bro
7700700	7704220	thank you you're welcome uh secondly i i kind of want to
7705100	7712620	tag along to something what bobby black was said about uh game zone quick let's say for for the
7712620	7720060	sake of it they they sent like a skeleton team to that to the venue just just just for the sake of
7720060	7726700	it now upon top of the fact that the company will have to pay cancellation fees from the venue
7726700	7732460	there's additional fees for the rooms because when you sometimes when you get these venues you got to
7732460	7739260	promise that you're going to fill x amount of rooms and if you don't fill them you basically
7739260	7747900	paying like like maybe up to 100 to 150 per room a con that i was violent told that that happened
7747900	7754460	its first year and it was kind of surprising they were able to bounce back with a uh year two so
7755260	7761420	that's i actually have known that from something else i'm working with on the side um that yeah
7761420	7766540	they're yeah the room guarantees and all that to to get the rates and all that yep that is very
7766540	7771580	true and that's something games done quick is going to have to figure out they're probably
7771580	7777740	going to have to pay it uh and and uh figure it out from their uh list viewership and maybe have
7777740	7781980	to have some fundraisers because you know they have they have their channel they run that channel
7781980	7787740	most of the time and it's not always for charity so they might run their own kind of fundraisers
7787740	7792940	to sort of you know fundraise to run the funds they like cover that stuff so they don't go
7792940	7796780	bankrupt i'm sure people would be more than willing to jump in i'm sure they will i'm sure
7796780	7802700	they will well that happened to magfest a couple of years back they they cancelled magfest paid
7802700	7808220	off the cancellation fees and had a telethon made and made the money back yeah so i'm sure
7808220	7813180	games done quick could do the same easy and and lastly there was something else but i totally
7813180	7818060	forgot but that's just how my my memory is got the retention of a goldfish sometimes but um i
7818060	7822300	kind of want to jump back to what you're talking about dragon con and the conventions and so forth
7822300	7828060	you know there are times when i have to deal with people like that in my own circles i just
7828060	7835980	want to just shake them if not shake them slap some sense into them what people don't understand
7835980	7842460	is that if a con cancels they got to pay all these fees out and sometimes they don't have
7842460	7849580	to depending on you know the local ordinances about covet and so forth and once we get past that
7849580	7854460	you have cons are like okay we're gonna do our thing but you gotta follow these rules you have
7854460	7862620	to mask up and all this and so forth and there are people that will push back and i remember
7862620	7867020	one of my favorite conventions i was actually getting into a pissing fight with somebody over
7867020	7872700	this and the people that run the convention messaged me begging me to stop and walk away
7872700	7878940	this one person was demanding that the con go on she didn't care about wearing a mask because she
7878940	7885820	said she was dying anyway she just wanted to have a good time and i'm just like who hurt you
7886780	7893340	you know that's and that's why that's why i don't fault dragon con or any con for what happened
7893340	7898700	number one i knew what situation i was working walking into number two my understanding is they
7898700	7902940	tried and what happened is that people were basically fighting with them those are the people
7902940	7911500	that i blame like but rob let me say this you didn't walk into anything you went in full well
7911500	7916780	knowing what was going on and you followed the protocols so that's what you did that was that's
7916780	7924060	perfectly fine indeed you do that not just for personal when you go out you do this for work i
7924060	7930620	mean they just said on the subways you do not have to wear a mask oh i saw that yeah i wear a
7930620	7935980	mask because you know what i don't trust half these people out here i'm just like no no i know
7935980	7945020	people who have caught covid like three four times and it freaks me out i'm just saying i've been a
7945020	7952220	lot i rode it i rode the atlanta subway on tuesday while i was apparently now now that i know i'm
7952220	7958380	such a while i was contagious those folks should be thanking me for wearing a mask honestly so
7958940	7962780	no i don't i don't need a medal or a treat i had to do what i had to do to get home
7962780	7966380	but you know it's just kind of one of those like it's not hard to wear a mask
7967180	7971980	it's common sense and as i said before covid one of those things that actually scares me because
7971980	7977740	i have actually known people who are on the brink of death and just bounced back from it and i'm
7977740	7986860	just like you know and next weekend i'm going to a con with somebody she cannot be vaccinated
7986860	7992540	due to her medical condition and i got masks and everything and i'm just like
7992540	7997900	and i'm just hoping that she's she'll be fine through this and she's already survived a round
7997900	8006700	of covid so um that is uh yeah but it's interesting so you but you saying she's going to the con
8006700	8010540	anyway and i think there would be a lot of people out there that would like to tell her
8011340	8018380	don't do it but you know it's it's her decision it's her decision not yours and that's that's
8018380	8023420	that's what was making me angry earlier right but the thing is she'll be wearing a mask so there's
8023420	8028380	that now it'd be a different story like there are some conventions that are like they they're
8028380	8033340	there are some cons where it's like you must have your your shots you must have your booster
8033340	8040700	and you must show proof of a negative test like 24 hours before the con you know and there are
8040700	8045580	people that argue that and yes there are those conventions that have that restrictive rules
8046140	8051900	it still happens but i always argue just wait just wait so everything is said and done you
8051900	8057820	count the numbers because of how strict they were the numbers on that's going to be very low and
8057820	8063500	and that's all that really matters i mean hell i went to a con a year and a half ago and i refused
8063500	8071500	to support them because they had a covid scare they they actually put that someone may have
8071500	8078300	tested positive and an email blast they sent out congratulating the winners of a raffle they put
8078300	8083740	that at the bottom and then i found out the next day they posted on their social medias
8083900	8093660	i i was just absolutely freaked yes it was a thin chance i caught it but it's just how they handled
8093660	8099100	the situation and then i found that one of my friends who's a voice actor in the industry
8099100	8105580	was a guest at that con and they never told him oh wow so that's yeah and i know i know i know
8105580	8109340	you were saying that like the convention sort of you know had a responsibility to tell people and
8109340	8114300	so forth i i also have to say that rama like i i don't necessarily disagree like at least
8114300	8117820	it would have been in their best interest to at least put out a tweet that said hey we had
8117820	8122540	a lot of people here this weekend you know you should follow these you know covid things for
8122540	8125660	safety or you should get a test and know your status or whatever like that would have been
8125660	8131420	really nice i think it would be a good thing however there it it's also necessary to put
8131420	8136460	some fucking accountability on the attendees you went to a convention that was intended by thousands
8136460	8143740	and thousands of people if you don't think you were exposed to covid i i i don't i don't know
8143740	8149660	there are some common sense things i don't know how to explain to people but also there's a
8149660	8156220	financial aspect of it like some of the hotels don't want to push back because these people will
8156220	8162300	cancel their rooms and that's less money coming in that weekend and given how the economy is you know
8162300	8168460	you gotta take take the hits where you can without being knocked out which i do understand to a
8168460	8175420	certain extent i'm one of those it's like if that if i'm running the place if that means y'all don't
8175420	8182060	show up and i lose their type of money that's fine the liability has dropped a lot at the end
8182060	8186940	of the day i will count my blessings count the money and see if we can do something next year
8186940	8191340	or if i'm running the hotel see we see if we can continue to keep the people on staff to keep the
8191340	8198300	hotel open you know i i'm sorry there no you're not wrong but there is an important element of
8198300	8204460	dragon con you have to remember um with those hotels and that is that there is a lot going on
8204460	8210860	in atlanta on labor day and even though i can't imagine being in that hotel and not being at
8210860	8216140	dragon con there are people that go to those hotels that are staying there for the football
8216140	8221180	games that are happening in town this weekend and guess who the crowd is that doesn't want to
8221180	8224300	wear the fucking mask around the hotel and the hotel doesn't want to be the bad guy
8226860	8233500	there have been times where odor con has happened and right across from the bc i mean from the
8233500	8239020	convention center you you have a bunt you have camden yards so they're so those people are coming
8239020	8245500	out seeing us running around in fabrics are like who are those freaks mind you we see them wearing
8245500	8250220	sports attire and they're painted up and we're like who are those weirdos you know
8251180	8260860	well i'm just glad things are starting to get better not at the rate that it should be but
8260860	8266700	at least we're getting somewhere you know at least the the evolutions of the virus seem to
8266700	8270940	be getting weaker and that's you know we just have to hope it keeps going in that direction
8270940	8276300	like i said earlier this last week has not been pleasant do not let me try to make it sound like
8276380	8281500	covid was a pleasant experience the second time or into that stuff no it sucked you do not want this
8281500	8287900	however swine flu was worse like i said that was i was worse i was i i remember one night when i
8287900	8295340	had swine flu i was like this is it this is the end that i mean i i laugh now but it wasn't funny
8295340	8303580	then so uh i i i i it hasn't been as bad as that but ev your mileage may vary look i got a friend
8303580	8309260	who caught covid back in december it's been nine months she still has a lingering cough so
8309900	8314620	yeah to i'll say this and i'm gonna get out of here for the night because i gotta prep for work
8314620	8321340	tomorrow and all that to paraphrase chris frock you know i don't one day we get to the point where
8321340	8325100	you've heard to your friend you're like how are you doing that man i don't know man yeah i'm all
8325100	8329340	right yo my cove has been acting up but i tell you what i took some testing last night and i'm feeling
8329420	8335180	great you know i hope we eventually get to that point where you know a little bit of tussle noodle
8336460	8343740	or something to put long covid in check right yeah yeah so all right take care of my friend
8343740	8347420	thank you for calling it's always good to hear from you no problem y'all take care and see you
8347420	8353100	on the flip side all right bye-bye anime jam session listen to it all right uh if you want
8353100	8357740	to give us a call vog network.com and you can join the green room and uh we'll get to that
8357980	8364140	vognetwork.com discord that is um i didn't check with loki to see if there's any last minute stories
8364780	8371980	uh yes there was there was a leak apparently um for blizzard's new overwatch 2 hero
8372620	8379820	uh kuriko i guess it was going to be a support character got accidentally leaked it is mentioned
8379900	8388460	in the season one premium battle pass um documented or it's like the description for that
8388460	8392220	which i don't know if they they've pulled that down or not but they actually have like
8392220	8401180	i think video or screenshots of the hero uh who has cat ears so um
8403020	8407100	yeah they're not too happy about that she's gonna be a support character i think i don't
8407100	8409740	remember oh she's a teleporting fox girl
8413660	8417260	sorry i just realized i was muted while i was typing um that sounds like it could be fun
8418860	8424300	ever everybody loves a cat girl and a fox girl right of course yeah they said it was uploaded
8424300	8429500	to a spanish um or uploaded in spanish it was an animated short for the character
8430060	8435740	and it said with a still in progress render like tag on it so i'm
8436860	8442380	i probably shouldn't have been leaked out probably not um but hey it could be like street fighter
8442380	8448460	six and your entire roster could have already been leaked so there is that yeah things things
8448460	8452940	could always be a little worse right it'd be worse yeah all right um i want to see if we have any
8452940	8456220	tweets i know there was at least one i wanted to read because there was a follow-up to something
8456220	8459820	that had come up on a prior episode so i'm looking at twitter right now if you want to
8459820	8464140	follow us on twitter we actually we are lucky enough to have a three letter name it's o-l-r
8464140	8469980	on twitter you can't even get that anymore o-l-r uh and if you want to follow us uh on twitter you
8469980	8475420	sure can and you can send us tweets throughout the week uh such as a tweet that we got from
8477980	8483580	uh i'm having to scroll through some comments that i made on the marvel game ah here it is um
8484220	8492220	zeba uh had tweeted saying here is the vod of cirque's production of clue in final fantasy 14
8492220	8497100	they had some technical difficulties and the audio didn't record so they manually put in the
8497100	8503900	soundtrack there's no in-game sounds it's a bit weird but it's still great so that was a tweet uh
8503900	8509820	from zeba uh who who sent us that and i actually did so it was uh them doing clue and it was the
8510540	8518380	movie uh they did it in uh final fantasy 14 and it was pretty um it was pretty neat but
8518380	8523420	you could see where the technical limitations kind of unfortunately got in the way a little bit
8523420	8529660	because um they like like characters would pop in and out because there were too many people
8529660	8534780	that were in the zone and so they weren't able yeah it's so so like characters would kind of
8534780	8538060	like come and go and stuff like that i'm actually trying to see if i can bring it up here on the
8538060	8543820	other monitor uh for you all oops you don't necessarily need to have the full music from
8543820	8548940	the theme but there you go if you've never heard the music from clue let me see actually i really
8548940	8552700	want to kill that because that's probably copyright music sorry about that uh let me
8552700	8556060	go to the other screen here you can actually see so here's the production let me make that
8556060	8561340	filled to the page there so you could see there is and so you can kind of see how it starts but
8561340	8565820	then when you really get into like what's happening throughout the event like look at
8565820	8569820	like all of these people here and whoever's recording this has to get like right up next
8569820	8577660	to the dinner table to see what's going on and then in other places i want to do the scenes where
8577660	8582060	it's really cutting in and out i think that was right maybe more towards the beginning like you
8582060	8585820	could just see how many people are in there and it's kind of hard to see like well who's the
8585820	8589740	character speaking and what what's happening and characters kind of pop in and out really fast
8590460	8595660	but i loved if you actually read like what's going on with the script they actually
8595660	8601020	localized things to fit aorza and the final fantasy universe and i thought it was super
8601020	8605580	cute like what they were doing with that so it was clever and my honest suggestion would be
8606380	8612700	do a performance of this just for the vod like i i know that it's very attractive to do this in
8612700	8617900	game and get people to the house and all this type of stuff but do a performance for the vod
8617900	8622220	like you know and that whole thing and and really show off you know the talent that goes into it
8622220	8626380	without the technical problems of having people you know show up and stuff and some comments from
8626380	8631180	chat so as joan hunter matt says dinner theater fantasy style and dr cio says wow that's great
8631180	8636380	yeah like it's it's really clever and cool and unique and this is one of the those spontaneous
8636380	8642220	things that happens to mmos that i love um but just some of the technical issues of the game
8642780	8648300	aren't really prepared for it and that's a bummer all right well with that that was it for the
8648300	8653420	tweets tonight and we did not get any emails that participate at orangeslaunchradio.com
8653420	8656940	but i will invite you to send some for next week so again that's participate at
8656940	8661420	orangeslaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email i think that's going to do it for the show
8661420	8666860	my voice is about done with tonight as well so i think we're going to wrap up uh but let's go
8666860	8671020	around and get uh final thoughts and stuff uh before that i will say thank you as always for
8671020	8676620	listening to orange launch radio um if you enjoyed what you heard here please tell a friend about
8676620	8680460	the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice and
8680460	8685900	in order to get those voices out on air we need more people here a nice five-star review on a
8685900	8691260	site like itunes spotify or wherever you found this podcast that all goes an awful long way
8691260	8696620	super appreciate that before i get to my final thought i have to make sure we say this at some
8696620	8702540	point as well i know we've had a lot of um bummer news tonight and things in our lives that we're
8702540	8709260	dealing with and so forth but on a somewhat more positive note i should note the date is september
8709260	8716300	11th and no i'm not referring to historical events uh in a in a winsmick way that would be tacky i
8716300	8722540	am referring to the fact that september 11th happens to be loki's birthday it does happy
8722540	8727820	birthday loki thank you did you get to do anything for your day in spite of everything
8727820	8733580	that's going on i did nothing and it was everything i thought it would be is that a good
8733580	8738460	thing because sometimes doing nothing for your birthday is a good thing no i just worked on i
8738460	8745260	worked on my uh my build for um my next episode still well you had a productive day then that's
8745260	8751500	good yep that's what i've been trying to do i have to go back to work tomorrow which i don't want to
8751500	8758540	do but um yeah i did want to mention though that i will be uh i think channel 64 is doing her next
8758540	8765420	stream weekend on saturday okay so um i may be participating in that as well so just stay tuned
8765420	8773900	to uh twitter or my youtube channel probably we'll have uh the schedule for that well the least the
8773900	8779180	least you could do for loki's birthday everybody is follow him on his youtube and his twitch and
8779180	8783500	his socials so yes subscribe to the youtube channel if you're not already every little bit
8783500	8791020	helps loki olr right yes all right uh okay now that i finally got that out of my system i meant
8791020	8796700	to say it um earlier but you know we got in a uh debate about something else so um i want to make
8796700	8801660	sure we got that happy birthday out though it is important so uh do you have any final thoughts
8801660	8808300	for our folks tonight loki nope just uh i can't wait for the next episode to be done it well
8808300	8813660	hopefully be done this weekend but that's a lot of building i gotta do it's it's really big
8814620	8822220	but yeah it's really cool um i can't wait for you to see it uh and i i don't have a lot to say here
8822220	8826300	either just um you know i've said a lot earlier in the show i hope to get back into streaming on
8826300	8831900	my own this week you know i usually leave dragon con so motivated to stream again from all the
8831900	8836380	panels and things that i did so it really sucks that covet kind of put the brakes on that um
8836380	8840700	because i would have been right back into it this week but it didn't happen but i am hoping i'm
8840700	8843820	getting better enough especially from doing this show tonight and hopefully that continues tomorrow
8843820	8850300	although my number one onus right now needs to be taken care of alan and making sure he has all his
8850300	8855820	needs net but assuming that is all taken care of i will stream tomorrow i want to make sure i i do
8855820	8858940	that and kind of get back in the habit of that i have no idea what i'm going to play yet but i'll
8858940	8865980	play something um so yeah oh really quick quick i did want to mention since we didn't recover before
8865980	8871420	for the live folks who are watching on twitch the game behind me is called one dreamer is a game
8871420	8879420	that came out uh this week and it's like a i think it's a point click adventure game sort of where
8879420	8885100	you do coding in it as well i played the the demo a while back and it was pretty awesome i i'm
8885100	8889580	hoping to get a chance to play this the full game but apparently i think it was made by a single
8889580	8896300	person over the course of seven years so it's just it's about kind of i haven't played it all
8896300	8900140	the way but i think it's supposed to be about and it's probably going to ring true to a little bit
8900140	8908380	to me um about like indie game devs and like these projects that they kind of set aside for a long
8908380	8914940	time and going back to like finish them some type of things so i think that that's some of it but
8914940	8919980	yeah it's pretty cool you should go check it out sounds like it might hit close to home all right
8919980	8922940	that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio we'll be back in seven
8922940	8926780	days to do it again hopefully dark sakura is feeling up to joining us as well that week and
