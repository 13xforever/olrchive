1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,360
You know the Sims? And the current game in that series has just under $1000 of DLC? Now

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,980
you can get the base Sims 4 for free! Thanks EA! You finally understood where the money

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,400
is made and gave people the same thing that shareware of decades past did in order to

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,740
entice consumers and provide value. Generosity! Wow! This is one story that should have come

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,620
out years ago. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell

6
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,640
you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,660
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:46,220
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

9
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:53,420
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:01,020
number 930 of our show for tonight September the 18th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and

11
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,780
I am joined with my co-hosts. Say hello and welcome back to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

12
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,220
Your hi didn't come through. You might be muted but how are you?

13
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,220
I'm not muted.

14
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,940
Now it came through. That was weird. Well, how are you?

15
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,940
My voice is still kind of messed up.

16
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,220
Well, I hope you are feeling better overall though.

17
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:27,940
I am for the most part. I'm on prednisone for my cough. One more week off of work. I

18
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:39,940
mean, it's, I'm getting bored. But I've got other stuff to be doing. But yeah, it's, it's,

19
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:45,460
yeah I just want the cough to go away and so far on my second day I've been pretty okay.

20
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,020
Just my voice is still trying to go out a little bit.

21
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,580
I mean, not your voice going out, but the cough is getting better. I talked a little bit on last

22
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:00,260
week's show about my own COVID troubles and luckily the cough for the most part has subsided. I still

23
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,060
hear Alan with it a little bit. But the interesting thing is we tested negative on the same day,

24
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,860
even though he didn't come down with COVID for about four or five days after me, but

25
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,100
he had Paxlevid. I didn't this time. So I think that helped.

26
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:26,460
So I, you know, in my case, I, we're not sure if my other issues extended it, or if it's considered,

27
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:33,500
you know, long COVID or not. So yeah, but I'm feeling better, which is good because, you know,

28
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,980
I've got TwitchCon coming up. Yeah, right. I'm like, well, at least I've gone through all that

29
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,740
before TwitchCon. I mean, I'd still like to get the shot, but I just, I have to talk to my doctor

30
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,140
about the timeframe. Of course I'm going to TwitchCon. Okay. I thought for some reason you

31
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,860
weren't and I, well, then I should have gotten a bigger hotel room for Disneyland on Monday.

32
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,020
Oh, well, we're flying. So we're flying back on Monday. So, because we, now, now we've missed

33
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,500
more work than either of us wanted to. So we don't want to extend the trip and we have, we're going

34
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:11,740
to Seattle in November. So there's, there's that we have as well. So yeah, I, my, my work takes

35
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:18,300
care of us for stuff like that. However long it takes to get better. That's good. So I can give

36
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:26,140
you more about that, but I've got a nice Airbnb with some of the other Twitch folks. Yeah, like

37
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:34,460
staying with Intoxicated and Fluffy and Deez Nuts. I'm sorry, you're friends with Deez Nuts?

38
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,380
Is that what you're saying here? Yes. All right. Is Deez Nuts your bestie?

39
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,420
We, we know each other. You, you, you're, you're pretty fond of Deez Nuts is what you're saying.

40
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,580
Look, you set it up. I took the shot. All right. Well, and also Cup of Jojo. I don't know if you've

41
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,660
ever. Yeah, I do recognize some of these names. I do. Yeah. All right. It's going to be a big

42
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,820
reunion there. Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki. Hello. You had me worried there

43
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,260
for a minute. I thought behind you, that was the footage we were going to talk about at the top of

44
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,500
the show tonight, but no, I recognize the characters. That's actually Grand Theft Auto 5.

45
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:27,220
I would never do that. Leak footage on the air. Who would do that? Me? No, but take two,

46
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,100
you know, is going to go hog wild with those takedowns. So obviously we will not be doing

47
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,100
any of that here tonight because we like our show to be able to be viewed in the archive.

48
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,140
But there's nothing wrong with showing Grand Theft Auto 5, a fine, a fine game,

49
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:47,540
in the Grand Theft Auto series. A game of all time. It is a game. Yes. Well, shoot, I guess I

50
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,980
kind of gave away what we're going to talk about at the top of the show here. We do talk about

51
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,740
video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. We do it live every Sunday night,

52
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,380
nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash

53
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,380
vog network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And, uh, you know, contrary to last week,

54
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,340
last week was a little bit slower in the news department. This week we had Tokyo game show.

55
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,300
So we've got a Nintendo direct to talk about. We've got a PlayStation direct to talk about.

56
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,380
We've got, um, other news that came out of Tokyo game show to talk about. Like there's,

57
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,620
there's no shortage of news this week. And then this morning, huge bombshell in the industry

58
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,380
drops. Um, yeah, Loki, you're, you're the fan here on this program of this series.

59
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:44,180
Tell us what went down. So, um, a user by the name of, uh, teapot Uber hacker, um, posted a link to,

60
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:51,060
um, it was a telegram download for 90 videos that they quote unquote,

61
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:59,060
goal from rock stars, um, from an employee Slack account. Um, this is also apparently the same

62
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,780
individual who hacked, um, Uber recently as well. And so on top of this, they say they,

63
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:12,660
they had 90 plus video clips from the game in development, uh, debug code or with the

64
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,060
debug code and stuff. They also said they had, I think the source for GTA five and I think for

65
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:29,300
sex as well. Um, so I mean, I'm not just gonna not download that. So, uh, I watched all of the

66
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,100
videos. Look, here's the thing. We're not going to play it here on the show, but you have social

67
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,740
media, you have a Twitter account. It's very easy to search to look at this and like, like, look

68
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:45,140
again, I think it's unfortunate this happened to rock star, but how am I going to not see it when

69
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,340
this is huge gaming news going on today in the industry? Can I just say this though, for what

70
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,900
it's worth? I mean, it sucks that rock star was robbed of a moment and the employees that have

71
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,980
been working on the game have been robbed of this. I, and I know gamers are always going to have

72
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,660
something to say and commentary, even though so many of them that do commentation on this industry

73
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,620
have no idea what they're talking about and what goes into actually making a game. But can I say

74
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,300
so like, Oh, how is this game using reused assets from grand theft auto five? Because that's what

75
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,460
every game does early in development. I don't think it is using reused assets from somebody

76
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,460
called that out on Twitter and was right through the coals out for it. But here's the thing is that

77
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,820
I actually thought it looked really good. I was like the graphics in this game are incredible.

78
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,700
This looks like this really looks next gen. So the rumor is the story supposed to take place

79
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:45,060
around these two main characters, Jason Lucia. So we have a female main protagonist in the game as

80
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,060
well. And it's supposed to be like a Bonnie and Clyde type story. So much like you can play three

81
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,580
different characters in five, it looks like you can at least play through two characters right

82
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:01,300
now. Like literally literally the opening scene in Pulp Fiction is what it is. Yeah, they had they

83
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:08,260
had a good scene where they were robbing a a fast food place and it kind of showed off some of the

84
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:15,460
stuff there most of the video because I watched all 90 of them. So most of the video they weren't

85
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:22,340
very long. Most of the video was just animation tests. So it's like testing animation blending

86
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,220
looks like they have a brand new animation system that's working with the game itself. So

87
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,980
you know, for different character aiming and stuff, it's gonna be very,

88
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:39,140
very dynamic the way it looks like it works like they have like different points of the body that

89
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,020
are kind of, you know, facing different directions and blending together and all that kind of stuff.

90
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:50,420
So there's a lot of tests regarding that. There was footage of like, it's basically just it's a

91
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:56,020
lot of debug stuff. It's either they're taking, you know, video footage of like, here's a bug

92
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:04,020
to here's some video footage of us testing this system and stuff. So it was kind of interesting

93
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,420
to see all that kind of behind the scenes stuff. I mean, obviously a lot of this is not close to

94
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,180
being finished, but it is pretty polished from what we've seen so far. There are a lot of

95
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,820
placeholder things like you could see some buildings that don't have the date like they've

96
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,020
I mean, it makes sense because you don't put those those checkerboard those checkerboard

97
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,940
textures that you always see in test. Yeah, that that's a test levels that they put in there to

98
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,500
test animations. They have a vehicle test level to test, you know, vehicle physics and whatnot.

99
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,460
And they have like different materials and they're testing just all they have, you know, stuff for

100
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:50,340
that. And then there's the main world that they're kind of testing stuff in as well. And I mean,

101
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,740
it looks pretty polished, but they've still got, you know, obviously there's placeholder buildings

102
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,820
and stuff in there where the details aren't necessarily there, which is fine. I mean, that

103
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,660
and the character models, there's a lot of like temporary character models that they're just using

104
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,900
it for, you know, kind of testing the mission scripting and all that stuff because all that

105
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,820
stuff comes like last like all of the polish and stuff on there.

106
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,140
And so some folks pointing out in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

107
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,780
SSG100 Matt says it's two year old alpha footage, it's going to be totally different and probably

108
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,660
already totally different. Not all of it is. Some of it is taken down and I want to see it.

109
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,300
Just so just search for GTA six, but use the Roman numeral six leaks on Twitter

110
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,260
and like go sort by recent. And you'll see videos as they come up.

111
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,220
It's a lot of it because all the files were dated. So I don't know if they're all from the

112
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:49,460
same builds, but based off of the build information that's in there, you can see which version of

113
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:54,420
Windows is running on. So some of them are from earlier. We'll just from a little bit earlier

114
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,820
this year. If the file names are to be believed, some of them are within like a few days ago.

115
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:10,020
Oh, and upwards to I think 20 like 2019 or 2020 is how far back they go. But it you can obviously

116
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,300
tell like from just some of the stuff that they're testing, like some of it's just like basic

117
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:20,020
animation things. Some of it now is more, you know, does the animation look correctly for

118
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,620
shooting out of a window? No, this is my character. You turn correctly, is it not look all

119
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,940
janky and that type of stuff. So they they're doing more of the complex stuff now to get that

120
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,380
going. But you can see their mission creation stuff. You know, a lot of it obviously is a huge

121
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,460
peak behind the curtain for better or for worse, right? It's a huge peak. It's still probably a

122
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:50,420
ways off. I think I think it's probably at least in the next year, not the year after by by this.

123
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,340
But it looks really good. That's the pre alpha stuff looks better than Saints Row.

124
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,100
I know. I think this might surprise you in some way that we're saying this. And again,

125
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,620
I'm not advocating what happened. It sucks that this happened. The fact of the matter is once on

126
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,740
the internet, always on the internet. So now that I've looked at the footage, I am like,

127
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,180
actually, it looks really good. Like the graphics look incredible. And I don't usually super get

128
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,740
into these games. But I've been trying I'll get into it in my gaming week. I've been trying a lot

129
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,780
of new shoes on the feet this week, thanks to things like game pass. And I got to admit,

130
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:32,980
I'm kind of interested in this. So for what it's worth, you won me over even though it was not

131
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,420
intended this way. And I'm sure that the actual polished trailer will be even more hype. But it's

132
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,620
interesting. Right. And the game, you know, for those who aren't familiar is going to take place

133
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:50,820
in Vice City, as was rumored to be the case. And it looks good. I mean, it looks good so far. Like

134
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:57,780
they certainly haven't shied away from all of like the lewd stuff like Saints Row did Saints Row was

135
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,660
like, we can't put any of this inappropriate stuff in there. It's just ridiculous. But we're

136
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,700
going to murder a ton of people. Whereas they're like, you know, there's a strip club scene in this

137
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:14,340
footage already. Like so it's it's like, I'm glad Grand Theft Auto is just Grand Theft Auto,

138
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,940
honestly, like they had some NPC dialogue, you know, this guy like spouting off all this like

139
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:26,900
QAnon, like conspiracy theory nonsense, you know, you're talking about like social media companies

140
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,060
trying to track your every movement and stuff like that. But it's all in game stuff. Obviously,

141
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,980
you know, they're talking about life life hacker and stuff like that, which is I think their

142
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:42,820
Facebook. It's just, I don't know, it's funny, it's it would be, I am very much looking forward

143
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,740
to a new Grand Theft Auto. Yeah, the story campaign. I am not looking forward to a Grand

144
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:56,900
Theft Auto online too, which will just be melt to death with microtransactions. But the stories are

145
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,380
always very good. I want to come back to Grand Theft Auto online in a minute because people say

146
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,780
this is actually the most damning part of the leak like whatever the Grand Theft Auto six part,

147
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,620
they'll recover from this. I mean, it sucks that they got the wind knocked out of it a little bit

148
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,260
with their big announcement everything but like, remember Half Life 2, like the entire source code

149
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,300
for that game leaked before it came out and that game ended up doing just fine. And I think Grand

150
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,460
Theft Auto six is going to be just fine. But let's talk about Grand Theft Auto online in a moment. I

151
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,860
want to get some more comments from the chat over twitch.tv slash vog network. Quest Buster says the

152
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,100
dev and debug panels were visible in the footage I saw like the holdup scene there was a lot of

153
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,140
placeholder code pinging reactions, behaviors, etc, with a bunch of dummies filling in. There

154
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,340
were also voice acting already implemented for the scene, which was surprising. It may be less

155
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:48,100
surprising if they actually mocap to the actors performing it as was what they did in Red Dead

156
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,420
Redemption, which you know, I kind of learned a lot more about thanks to Dragon Con and interviewing

157
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,420
the folks behind it that actually may have been one of the first things they did. It could be that

158
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,300
the main actors are actually motion captured like they were in Red Dead. I don't know. Loki is does

159
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,260
that seem like probably yes, it will be the case because that's how they did five. So it's not

160
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,980
they're going to do this until they did read it. And so that has to come first and then they add

161
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,020
everything in around it basically. And that's why the placeholder, you know, people in the diner and

162
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,340
stuff are probably not actually mocapped. And so they're they're getting added in and they're at a

163
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,940
different stage. So other comments in chat as to 100 Matt says the problem this is going to cause

164
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,020
not just would take to stock will take a hit tomorrow. But also the employees will be under

165
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,820
a lot of scrutiny now work from home arrangements may be revisited for some folks video and

166
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:40,100
screenshots not shared in slack probably this leak is going to make stabs lies very difficult. Yeah,

167
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:48,580
that's a very realistic look at the situation. I mean, with what minimal we've heard about how this

168
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:55,300
leak happened. I heard in there. It came from an employee's slack account. So one of two things

169
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,500
happen. And I think one is far more likely than the other one. You have a disgruntled employee.

170
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,700
I think that's the less likely one. Yeah, because just people are going to be afraid of this

171
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,740
contracts because yeah, the guy that basically said they hacked this did the same thing to Uber

172
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:18,900
in the same, you know, method to infiltrate it was social, social engineering. So she get the

173
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,940
credentials for an employee's slack account, and then downloading the information based off that

174
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:30,420
and see. I mean, I don't, I don't understand slack too much. But like, why is your source

175
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:36,820
code for your game linked in your slack account? Like, well, I mean, like the full back it up,

176
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:43,700
it probably opened the door to being able to from slack, get other credentials to log into place.

177
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,500
Like I don't think the source code was just sitting there on slack. I think there were

178
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,660
other credentials, as that person was going through the different chat rooms and so forth,

179
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,700
probably found maybe an internal leak. Maybe it turned out the person's slack login was also

180
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,900
some type of intranet login. Like there's a million things that could have happened

181
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,300
that I think it was, I don't think it's like the source code was just posted there to pin post on

182
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,860
slack. It's not that, but I think it was the first, first breadcrumb to get to that stuff

183
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:15,540
is what it was. I think that's how it happened. And my question is, if it was social engineering,

184
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,740
where the hell was two factor authentication? I realize there are very sophisticated ways to get

185
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,580
around that nowadays. So I guess it could have been there, but I would say if two factor auth

186
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:32,740
wasn't enabled and mandated for everybody, it sure will be tomorrow. And quite honestly,

187
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,420
even if you're not at take two, two factor authentication is going to be mandatory for

188
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,300
you in the next couple of weeks, if not already. At my work, you can't get into anything without

189
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,660
being on a specific VPN. Yeah. Yeah. Now Bobby Black Wolf does point out, and yes, I do. I'm not

190
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,140
a complete dummy. I know that there are ways around two factor authentication.

191
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,460
So Bobby Black Wolf says grabbing session tokens gets around two factor auth. I do know that,

192
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:04,900
but haven't we heard way too much in the news? Like this is how in politics, do you remember

193
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:11,620
the whole Democrat email server breach and this whole thing? That was all a targeted phishing

194
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:17,780
social, it was all that. And the person did not have two factor authentication because it wasn't

195
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,660
required for whatever reason, and they got in there. So this type of stuff unfortunately

196
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:29,060
happens a lot, even without two factor auth. And somebody probably didn't realize, oh, we probably

197
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,140
need this on Slack as well because all these breadcrumbs lead these different directions.

198
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,420
Again, I'm not the hacker, so I don't know how they did it, but based on the limited information

199
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,180
we have, I don't see how it's not this one way or the other. And now this is the part that

200
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:50,180
has to be looked at is how are people logging into these applications like Slack or Microsoft

201
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,940
Teams, whatever it is, what kind of information is being put on these things? That's the stuff

202
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,260
that's really going to be under a microscope, I think in the coming weeks, no matter where you're

203
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:08,820
at, especially at Take-Two, but has this been unique to Take-Two either? No. But what about

204
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:15,220
Capcom? Remember that just happened not that long ago, and I bet it was a very similar sort of thing,

205
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,860
and so on and so on. So anyway, I wanted to talk a little bit about the Grand Theft Auto Online and

206
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:28,580
the source code leaking for that. Loki, people are saying that that could bring Grand Theft

207
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:35,540
Auto Online to its knees. What's your takeaway on that? Probably not. I don't think it will.

208
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:40,900
If anything, it'll just help with cheat making and stuff like that, but I don't think it will.

209
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,900
And also at this point, if the new game's coming out and there's going to be a new

210
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,060
Grand Theft Auto Online anyways, I don't think it's going to matter. Well, but that thing's

211
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,980
still a cash cow and has to pay to keep the lights on for the next two years while they

212
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,620
polish Grand Theft Auto 6. But I'm not saying Grand Theft Auto Online is going to suddenly

213
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:06,740
shut down. I mean, worst case scenario, question mark, everybody has to download a new client to

214
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,020
log in. Like they could do some major patches to the client to try to patch out whatever they come

215
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,900
up with. But that could be a huge undertaking in a lot of hours that I'm not sure the company wants

216
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,620
to put onto Grand Theft Auto Online. Well, despite what I don't like with Grand Theft Auto Online

217
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:30,900
and the way that Rockstar Games handles things, I do the one positive upside you could take from

218
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,300
that is like with the source code leaking for Grand Theft Auto Online, that means that when

219
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,380
they do shut down Grand Theft Auto Online, someone will be able to create dummy servers

220
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,340
for Grand Theft Auto Online to be able to continue that on afterwards. So it is good for video

221
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,940
game preservation in that sense. But I mean, it's already a hacker mess anyways,

222
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,420
and Grand Theft Auto Online anyways, from what I understand, though, I don't see how this is

223
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:03,140
any different. All right, I heard something about that Grand Theft Auto 5 source code already went

224
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,700
for like $100,000 or something like that on the dark web or whatever you want to call it.

225
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,500
Ah, yeah, whatever that means. Yeah. But, you know, as again, pointed out in chat by

226
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,420
Quest Buster, and I said it earlier, remembers when the Half Life 2 source code was leaked,

227
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,220
like so you know, again, Grand Theft Auto 6 is still going to sell 11 billion copies.

228
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:28,500
The reality is most people, most people buying that game aren't checking gaming news on Twitter

229
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,860
regularly. That's the fact of the matter. Most people that are buying these games are not the

230
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,860
people that are tuned into looking at leaks and that sort of stuff. And even if they did, again,

231
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,340
I would think most people are going to be like, wow, that looks pretty good. But I guess there's,

232
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,100
you know, gamers are going to be gamers sometimes and everybody's going to have a criticism. But

233
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,460
I mean, understanding that this is still in development stuff,

234
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,340
you know, the stuff that I saw, I was like, wow, okay, now I see why this game is taking forever.

235
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,140
To be honest, like, I'm like, okay, yeah, like, this is definitely like next level graphic stuff.

236
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,660
And I can say this is taking a very long time. I think they're claiming that they're not going

237
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,100
to be crunching their employees, which is why it's been developed over however many years.

238
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,860
Yeah. I mean, let's be honest, like, they're making billions of dollars off of Grand Theft

239
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:25,220
Auto, like each year. So they have the resources to be able to not stress their employees and to

240
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,620
be able to pay them for the long haul to develop a great game. Like, so there's absolutely no

241
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,780
excuses like, well, we, we had to get it out early because we just didn't have the funding.

242
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,300
No, you have so much money. Like, it's just not even a problem. Yeah.

243
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,100
All right. Well, we'll see what develops tomorrow is going to be I mean, the bummer,

244
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,100
quote unquote, is that for the live folks, we kind of have to wait for tomorrow to see what

245
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,580
Take Two's official response really is. And I bet the lawyers are going to be out there in mass,

246
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,100
shutting down the footage the best they can. I'm sure they're already on it.

247
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,980
You know, once on the internet, always on the internet, it's a very hard thing to-

248
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,780
The post is gone.

249
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,740
What's that?

250
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,860
The forum post is gone.

251
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:09,620
Oh, yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. So I, you know, all that. Bobby in a chat reposting a Twitter joke.

252
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,260
Breaking news, police have arrested the man suspected of stealing the GTA source code.

253
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,140
However, he immediately respond outside the police station. Yes, yes. Well, but you know,

254
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:24,340
if this person is caught, if this person is caught, they, I mean, that's what ended up

255
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,660
ultimately happening with the Half-Life 2, if I remember right, is the guy had the gall to contact

256
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:37,940
Gabe Newell looking for a job and ended up getting arrested by like, it was either the FBI or the

257
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,740
German version of it because I believe the guy was in Germany or, you know, again, this was a

258
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,580
long time ago. My memory is a little rusty, but he was arrested by authorities somewhere on his way

259
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,820
to go talk to Gabe Newell about getting a job when I think Gabe Newell had planned to turn him

260
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:59,620
in himself. So if this person does get caught, if, there could be harsh penalties. Of course,

261
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,540
if this person is in certain countries where they're not going to extradite and they're not

262
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:13,220
going to give a shit, then it's not going to matter. So we'll see. Let's see. Let's see.

263
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,980
Dang, there's one other thing I wanted to say on that. Oh, well, it'll come back to me later,

264
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,860
I'm sure. But I'm also looking at chat. Zen Monkey says, I was thinking he was just a fellow gamer

265
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:28,740
looking to keep your Anthototo online after the server shut down. We'll see. It could have been

266
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:35,220
somebody, you know, because if I recall correctly, it was either the Witcher 3 source code or the

267
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,660
Cyberpunk source code. Somebody bought that with the intent to give it back to CD Projekt Red.

268
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,220
They bought it with the intent to keep it offline. So I'm not saying that happened here,

269
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,500
but it may have been a, I don't know what you would call it, a white knight or something,

270
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:57,620
a knight in shining armor. The name escapes me, but somebody tried to do a good thing,

271
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,460
basically, for the company. So we'll see. You mean like a Good Samaritan?

272
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,260
Yeah, Good Samaritan. That's it. Thank you. Trying to do this, you know, but that's a lot

273
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:13,300
of money to be in a Good Samaritan. All right. Anyhow, we'll see what Monday's response looks

274
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,820
like. For those on the podcast feed, by the time you're hearing this, you'll probably already hear

275
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,540
some stuff from Take Two, and I'd be very curious to see, you know, what they're going to say about

276
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:26,420
it. I'm not sure there's a lot they can, except emphasizing that they really frown on this being

277
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:32,340
shared, that it is early in development, and we look forward to showing you an official look,

278
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:38,100
a polished look at Grand Theft Auto 6 very soon. I'm not sure there's a lot they can say outside

279
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,060
of that. All right, let's talk about the games we have been playing this week in a segment called

280
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,740
How Is Your Gaming Week that we do here every week, and Dark Sakura, let's go to you. How

281
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:53,060
is your gaming week? Of course, I've been playing Dead by Daylight. I also watched the Light in the

282
00:25:53,060 --> 00:26:01,540
Fog tourney. That was pretty fun. I have been playing Cold to the Lamb. Final Fantasy IV,

283
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:07,780
I got back to last night. I'm close to beating the game, so I'm either going to do Final Fantasy V or

284
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:15,380
Star Ocean next. I haven't decided. I think I'm going to do V. Wordscapes have been playing,

285
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:22,740
Patterned again, because they put out an update for Patterned today. I had something else that's

286
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:28,260
on. Oh, yeah, and I'm going to be starting Avengers, I think, when I'm done with Cold

287
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:36,820
to the Lamb. Nice. Playing through Stadia again. Nice. By the way, weren't you, I forgot to ask

288
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,820
you before we were on air, so sorry to spring this on you, but did you still do that other

289
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:46,740
show today? Did you want to give it a plug? I did. I did do the interview for Stadia dosage,

290
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:55,860
and I believe it will be live on Tuesday. I'll be given a link soon as to when it will be on,

291
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:06,260
but it's going to be reposted on YouTube, so look for Stadia dosage. I had just the best time

292
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,940
talking to MM2K, who has also been a long-time listener of us. Oh, that's great. Yeah, and it

293
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:20,420
was a really good experience. We basically went way off the rails about different topics,

294
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:26,820
because I think we're both fairly passionately opinionated people, and we talked about the

295
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:36,020
state of gaming, and about people needing to know their roots, and shaking our canes at the kids on

296
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:46,260
our lawn. Just the difference that Stadia has made to us, and especially for me, being a Mac gamer,

297
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:53,620
Stadia has been the way I get to play some of these things, because of incompatibility with

298
00:27:53,620 --> 00:28:03,620
the ARM environment for Windows. There's been some of that going on. Still trying to get me to play

299
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:14,820
Division, and I don't think I'm going to, but we'll see. We talked for, gosh, maybe three and

300
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:23,220
a half hours, including the interview. We could have gone more, but I was losing my voice.

301
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:32,900
So it was a really great experience. I'm looking forward. I don't like to listen to my

302
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:39,220
voice, as I know that you know, especially right now, since I sound like I've been swallowing gravel.

303
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:48,020
But I'm thinking it's going to be pretty good. We went over some pretty big

304
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:58,580
stuff too, just in terms of why 60 frames per second on games is going to be the max

305
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:07,860
that would be, what's the word I'm thinking of, perceptible by human eyes, outside of going into

306
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:15,220
long exposures and things, and doing multiple frames in slow-mo, and various.

307
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:26,980
Like, I know we were talking about CRTs, and why a 60 frames per second game played on a CRT isn't

308
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:34,820
going to make a big difference, as it would be on a nice LCD screen, about pixel size, scan refresh,

309
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:46,100
that type of thing. We went into color theory, and just talking about the differences between

310
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:52,420
the games that we used to play, and the games we're playing now, and updating them, and various,

311
00:29:52,420 --> 00:30:01,700
and talked about, great, my brain just blanked. I was just saying, it sounds like it'll be a

312
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:10,900
good interview. Is the Stadia dosage, is that a podcast or a YouTube thing?

313
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:18,820
It's a podcast, but I think you also, if you go to stadiodosage.com, I'll put a link in the chat,

314
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,860
there is how you get to everything.

315
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,460
Nice, okay.

316
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:36,900
And yeah, it's really good. He's got some blog content on there too.

317
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:47,140
There's videos for the show and everything. So I think, I know it's on YouTube, and I'm sorry,

318
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:54,740
he didn't actually say that there's content on Stitcher and a few others. So

319
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,700
I think the audio is recapped.

320
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,420
Stitcher is just a podcast app. So yeah, I'm sure it's, that's cool. Great. All right.

321
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:13,220
I'm pretty excited about some of the stuff happening in the Stadiaverse.

322
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:20,260
All right. Well, we'll check in on the show later this week, it sounds like. All right. Well,

323
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,060
if that's it for your gaming week, let's go over to Loki. How was your gaming week?

324
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:31,220
It was all Minecraft again. Still working on my big build. So it is going to be the biggest

325
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:36,580
build I've ever done. So until you decide next time, I want to go even bigger.

326
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,460
Yep. Until next time.

327
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:47,220
Perfect. All right. Well, that's short and sweet. All right. My gaming week,

328
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,700
a lot of the same type of stuff. Still been playing Final Fantasy 14. My island sanctuary

329
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:57,540
is up to level nine. So I'm almost max level in the casual mini game, but I love the island

330
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,620
sanctuary stuff. It's very, I like to just sit there and gather while I either like watch Twitch

331
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,500
channels or YouTubes or whatever. So that's been very, very good to pass the time. So still playing

332
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:13,060
Final Fantasy 14. I finished the story patch content a long time ago. I don't really do

333
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,660
Savage rating. I don't really have the time or group to commit to it. So I just kind of take

334
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,740
the content that's there. I'm still really looking forward to the mid patch because it's supposed to

335
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,620
add in like a new type of endless dungeon sort of thing. So I'm really curious to see what that's

336
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,820
all about. So that'll be coming soon-ish. Otherwise, I've also been playing Diablo 3

337
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,180
and a lot of it. In fact, I've hit the point. My character is now Paragon, I think 730.

338
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:44,180
I think I hit. Now, the interesting thing about that, my non-seasonal Paragon or my

339
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:51,540
non-seasonal character is Paragon 715. What that means, anytime you beat a season, all of the XP

340
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:56,340
just dumps into your non-season characters. So what that means, right now in season 27,

341
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:03,860
that started a few weeks ago, I have more XP than my entire career over the last 10 years combined.

342
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:11,540
Now, I know, right? But here's some things to keep in mind. It's not exactly a one for one because

343
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:18,820
as these seasons keep going, they add new things so that you can progress farther into deeper rifts

344
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:25,940
where you get more XP. So I would say it's easier now to do a Torment 16 is no big deal

345
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:31,940
when the game used to cap out at Torment 6 and the greater rifts you could do were only so good

346
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,980
after that. So they've added things like ancients, primal ancients, and now there's this whole

347
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:43,300
arcane dust thing that they're doing in the recent season. So it's not quite one for one,

348
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,780
but still, I was pretty impressed to think like, wow, I have more XP on this character in five

349
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:55,380
weeks than my entire previous career. It's pretty something. I've also been playing Dead by Daylight

350
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,620
as well. I was playing on stream with some friends on Friday. I think once again, Dark

351
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,660
Sakura, I went and I checked back later and you had taken my place. I think they'd cycled a few

352
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,220
people through, but you had taken my place, so to speak, on a Taze Friday stream and that cracked me

353
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:13,460
up. So I hope you guys are having fun. I did come in when there were only three people in there and

354
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,140
I was joking, let me play with you. And I was like, no, I'm actually, I just got home and I'm

355
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,580
kind of tired. And he's like, actually, if you want to join in on the next round, I'm like, okay.

356
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:26,180
Nice. I don't know how it went for you. We had some really good matches. Like,

357
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:32,980
we escaped almost every time except for the last match I played, the killer decided to tunnel me

358
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,260
out, which- We had some really stinky people. Yeah.

359
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,900
I mean, but I don't know if you saw the screenshot that I put up on my Twitter

360
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,420
of us both slugged on Freddy's dirty mattress. Oh, Lord.

361
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:54,020
Yeah, it was, you know, and we were having fun. I mean, it was always a fun time. I like to,

362
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,780
you know, I've decided, it's just something for myself, that if I'm in a match with a stinky

363
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,420
person, the moment I realize they're stinky, I'm going to fuck with them.

364
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,660
Yeah. I mean, you know, and people, you know, I get asked this sometimes, like,

365
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,340
why do you keep playing that game when you talk about how terrible a lot of the players are?

366
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,620
Because you know what, when you are playing with friends or even if you're just, it is a lot of

367
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,820
fun. Like, it's just, you know what, because the match is over in 15, 20 minutes, and then you

368
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,460
move on to the next match and it's whatever. Exactly.

369
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,820
Yeah. Well, there's some people,

370
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:28,660
though, who don't let themselves get over it and are just, I don't know.

371
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,740
That's why I love this new anonymous mode. So people only, because, so they added a new thing

372
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,460
in the last patch where, you already know this, but I'm explaining for the listeners,

373
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,740
where you can replace your name with the name of the character you're playing. So for example,

374
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,220
if I'm playing Chris Redfield, then my name just shows as Chris Redfield, like 02 or 03,

375
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:50,420
whatever player number slot I'm in. So the other players, they can, they can talk all the smack

376
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,380
they want, but that's it. They got to leave it in the match because there's no way to find me

377
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:59,140
afterwards. So it's that, you know. Well, but even on top of that though,

378
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:07,300
I mean, it's just, it does get on, on you after you've had stink after stink after stink, you

379
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:16,500
know? And I've really just been trying to, you know, put myself a little bit past it,

380
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:24,420
you know, like, okay, so they're a piece of shit. Great. I don't have to dwell on it.

381
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,500
Once the game is over, they don't exist in my universe. That's what I'm trying to do.

382
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:37,860
You know, if it's bad enough, then maybe I will, you know, submit a, uh, you know, uh,

383
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,460
a video or, or something, you know, and then certainly not going to not talk about it.

384
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:50,580
You know, I want to make sure that they, cause like there were these people the other day who

385
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:59,860
are going, Oh, uh, kills the skills. I'm like, no, it's not. Kill is when you go and you give

386
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:08,340
everyone a fair chance to enjoy the game. Kill is when you're not just setting traps, you know,

387
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:13,140
unless you're playing trapper. Uh, you know, we were studying using a slugged person as bait or

388
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:20,900
just face camping somebody. And on top of that now I just flat out someone's face camping. I just,

389
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,940
I don't bother getting them. I just go in and do gens.

390
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,140
Exactly. That's what you have to do. Well, the reassurance perk, if,

391
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,740
if you're running it, which I usually don't, but it's extremely helpful now for those,

392
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:39,380
you know, face campers is great on two story levels. Yeah. Yeah. Cause then you can totally

393
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:46,660
just, uh, run above them. Yeah. Anyway. Um, there was dead by daylight, but here's,

394
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,860
here's the other game I've been playing this weekend. This one even surprised me,

395
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,540
but, um, and I'm sure it'll come up again later in the show. So sorry if I'm, uh,

396
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,740
biting a story here, but, um, you know, with Tokyo game show, Microsoft made several announcements

397
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,980
and they announced, you know, they were kind of focused on game pass a lot as they have been

398
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,980
lately in the States and other countries. So why wouldn't they do the same for Japan?

399
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,140
Uh, and they added a lot of stuff to game pass. And one of the games they added to game pass was

400
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:16,020
Assassin's Creed Odyssey. And I was like, Hmm, what the heck? I want to download this to see

401
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,700
what it's all about. And I have to admit, it took me a minute to get into it. I wasn't super

402
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:28,500
feeling it in the beginning, but as the game kind of started to ramp up a little bit and like the

403
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,620
world started opening up and I was getting branching questing paths, I'm kind of into it

404
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:39,300
now. Uh, and yeah, you know, I don't usually play these games. It's not, I don't know. I just,

405
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:45,940
I don't know why I just never have been, uh, super into the, the actiony, I think because I don't

406
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:51,860
really care for like stealth stuff. And I know Assassin's Creed is a lot of that, but because,

407
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,260
you know, how many of these games have there been by now? A ton, right? So they've learned

408
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:00,740
from each game. And a lot of them are in Stadia. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, and, but the thing with

409
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,260
Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and I'm sure some of the other more recent ones do this too,

410
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:11,380
but they, they have Bobby Black Wolf mode in it left and right. And it's, it's very easy. The

411
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:18,180
stealth part is not difficult. And even if you get seen, the enemies are like, what, what's that?

412
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:24,020
What's going on? They're kind of like slowly walking. Like it's just like very over the top

413
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:29,380
in like, they're not very skilled. Um, and you even can get an ability like right off the bat

414
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,980
where like, if you get seen, you can slow time instantly. So you can fire off an arrow shot

415
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,620
and still get like the first hit on him, even when you get seen. So they've, and I'm sure there

416
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:45,220
are a lot of people that will be like, well, that's not skill. That's I don't care. You sit

417
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,100
down and shut up and let me play my game the way I want to. And having those five seconds to get

418
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:56,180
that perfect headshot in with an arrow is just, is that's what I needed to make the game a little

419
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:02,340
more welcoming and interesting. And, um, yeah, I've been, I've been having fun with it and it

420
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,780
is really pretty. I will say this. It is really, really pretty because, um, I haven't been able to,

421
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,820
you know, I got this new PC a few months ago and I haven't played a lot of cutting edge 4k games on

422
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:20,900
it, but this game looks, looks marvelous, uh, on my system. It's, it's beautiful. Uh, I can't wait

423
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,220
to get to some more varied environments, but like I was in a cave and I was like, oh, this like

424
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:29,060
Tomb Raider I'm playing right now. This is cool. And then like, you know, some of the outside world

425
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:34,740
is very pretty that you, you take over a bird and some portions of the bird helps you see what's

426
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,140
going on, like literally a bird's eye view. So you can assess the situation before you go in

427
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,260
there. And like the way it handles it is very seamless and very, very cool. So yeah, I think,

428
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,220
I think I'm into Assassin's Creed all of a sudden, isn't that weird and wild, but this game is

429
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:55,140
interesting. Let me tell you the one complaint I have. So for, and this is, this is a silly

430
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,740
complaint, but I don't care. It's a complaint. So, you know, I'm spoiled by things like Mass Effect,

431
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:06,740
where you can create your own character. In this game, you can, you can at least pick your

432
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:12,900
character. Now you can play either Alexios, male, you can play Cassandra, a female. You couldn't

433
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:20,180
always even pick between those two. Um, but like Alexios, I just, I kind of wish I could make them

434
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:26,900
look different. Like I just don't really care for the base model. Um, but okay, whatever. And,

435
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:33,540
and why didn't I play Cassandra? I really could have, but I heard, I heard there was, uh,

436
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:39,220
same sex romance available in the game. So for that reason, I'm going to stick with Alexios.

437
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,140
So, um,

438
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:49,620
There was one I was interested in and it was, um, because in one of my art history classes, our

439
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:55,540
teacher talking about the Vatican, um, put up a picture of a screenshot from, I want to say it

440
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:02,180
was Assassin's Creed 2. Yeah, probably. That, uh, was actually a pretty faithful recreation

441
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:08,980
of what this particular block in Italy was supposed to look like. And ever since then,

442
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,340
I was like, I just want to play it and explore and not do any of the missions.

443
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:17,460
That, no, that is legit a mode in the newer games. Like maybe not Assassin's Creed 2,

444
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,620
but like, I haven't explored it yet. Maybe Quest Buster or somebody who knows the series better

445
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,420
than I do can elaborate, but I noticed there's an option on the main menu called discovery.

446
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,460
And I think with the last game, so the last game, uh, the name escapes you. It might've been

447
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:36,340
origins, but it was ancient Egypt themed. And I think they started there where you just like,

448
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,980
you can have like a history exploration mode where you just like are exploring the pyramids

449
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,300
in the game and this stuff. And I believe they did it here too, where you just are exploring

450
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:50,020
ancient Greece. Uh, and that whole thing, uh, that Quest Buster says in origins and Odyssey,

451
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,660
there is a tour mode. You can enable to just walk around and get the history behind the areas.

452
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:02,420
So, so there you go right up your alley. Right. So yeah. Yeah. So you don't, you don't,

453
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:07,460
if that's the game for you, that can literally be the game for you. I think that's pretty cool.

454
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:12,020
Uh, it's interesting because now there's ads for the new Assassin's Creed Mirage,

455
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,940
like all over the title screen and stuff. It's interesting how they can kind of do that,

456
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:21,220
um, in the, in the interface. But, uh, yeah, so I know I never thought I would become like

457
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:25,940
an Assassin's Creed fan, but I'm kind of like into this game. So we'll see, we'll see how we'll see,

458
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,940
you know, it's going to take me what, like 50 hours to beat it. So check in with me again in

459
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:35,300
a couple of weeks. Cause they also released Nino Cooney remastered edition on game pass.

460
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,420
And I've been very tempted to revisit that game, especially now that it's remastered, but, um,

461
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:46,740
you know, we'll see. We'll see. All right. That's plenty for my gaming week. Let's get into some

462
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:56,020
other gaming news. Um, it was a busy week. Like I said, yeah, short and sweet Minecraft, the biggest

463
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:06,820
realm ever. His biggest build ever build ever. Yes. So it's going to be amazing. You'll, I you'll

464
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:10,180
have to see what it looks like. Yeah. Did you see the Tokyo game show, uh,

465
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,420
sale on steam by the way? Ooh, no, I didn't. Is there some good stuff on there?

466
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:19,700
There's like a Ninja Gaiden master collection and a lot of the final fantasy updates. And,

467
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:27,620
but one that kind of surprised me was seeing a layer section. Um, which is probably one of the

468
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:31,060
favorite shooters we have in the house is actually galactic attack in a layer section.

469
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:38,420
Um, I mean, we've got them on Saturn, but, but I mean, and there's some pretty decent, uh,

470
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,500
mat games on there too, like some cute little stuff, but I was actually just really

471
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:49,220
surprised to see some of the ones on here. Um, also, uh, one of the, the 3d Toho games.

472
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,500
Well, you mentioned the final fan. If those are the pixel,

473
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:58,100
uh, Toho mechanical, uh, schoolery. If those are the, um, pixel remasters for

474
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,460
final fantasy, I do want to go back and pick more of them up. Cause I like, they,

475
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,780
they did a good job with four. I w that's the only one I bought. I only allowed myself to buy final

476
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:12,260
fantasy four and I liked it. Um, but I resisted buying any of the others because I was convinced

477
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:17,460
they were going to put them all out on switch at some point, but now June has come and gone.

478
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,260
Now Tokyo game shows come and gone with the Nintendo direct to play and no sign of the pixel

479
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,820
remasters. So I have a feeling maybe they're not going to put it on console after all. Of course,

480
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,100
they're just waiting for me to buy it and then it'll get put on console.

481
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:37,940
So, um, there's a game that I have on my list when it comes out called drill man rumble.

482
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:43,300
That's like a fighting game with people with giant drills.

483
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:49,460
Nice. Uh, and over in chat, of course the classic is on there by the way. Sorry.

484
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:54,100
No, that's right. The classic joke of Bobby black Wolf hates Nino Cooney has come up in our chat

485
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:59,220
room, uh, talking about the demo, because if y'all didn't remember and, you know, to explain

486
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:04,820
a years old and joke at this point, the original demo for Nino Cooney was terrible because it did

487
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:09,860
not give enough explanation as to what the hell was going on in the game. And so it was just,

488
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:14,820
it really was not fun to play through and it really did not get leave a good impression for

489
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:19,940
the game. But by the time the game came out, I ended up playing it anyway. And I actually liked

490
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:25,140
it. And I was like, wow, they did a really shit job with the demo because they did not, uh, make

491
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:29,620
this game as good as it actually is. I remember playing Nino Cooney 2 as well, which I believe

492
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:36,500
had some differences. It's been years since I've touched either one of them, but Nino Cooney 2

493
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,540
wasn't bad either. So I'm curious about the remaster for the first one, because despite,

494
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,740
you know, all this, you know, stuff that Bobby black Wolf says about the demo,

495
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:52,980
it is time to let a PlayStation 3 demo go now that we're on a remasters on, uh, you know,

496
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:59,220
PlayStation 4 slash 5. And so, uh, I'm curious, especially now it's on game pass, like, you know,

497
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,900
hello, you don't have to pay anything extra for it if you're already paying for game pass.

498
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:08,180
So it makes a pretty good case to check it out. And of course, never, never forget, never forgive

499
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:15,380
you typical gamers. You all in chat. All right, let's move on and talk about speaking of

500
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:20,740
PlayStation. Thanks to Tokyo game show this week, we got a lot of PlayStation news in a,

501
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:25,940
in a state of play. I keep saying PlayStation direct. We all know what influenced PlayStation

502
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:29,860
state of play. We all know where it's a PlayStation direct, which is just their own branding. We get

503
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:36,420
it. It's just, it's Sony being on brand with stealing Nintendo ideas. Yeah. Um, so yes,

504
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,580
they had a state of play event where they showed off a bunch of different games,

505
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:46,500
including trailers for Tekken eight, which looks pretty awesome. Uh, they just have like a little

506
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,700
animated, I don't even know if it was really gameplay, but basically saying that stay tuned

507
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:57,860
for more information about that, uh, star Wars tales from the galaxies edge enhanced edition,

508
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:01,780
which is an enhanced version of the game that came out in the Oculus quest.

509
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:07,140
And that's supposed to be out for the PlayStation VR to whenever that's out, uh,

510
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:12,580
Demeo is coming to the PlayStation VR too, as well. It's like a tabletop, uh, VR game

511
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:20,820
and it looks pretty cool. Uh, like a dragon Asian, which is another, uh, Yakuza spinoff game.

512
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,100
Although, you know, not to be confused, I think like a dragon, I'm not sure if they're

513
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:29,780
re rebranding their whole Yakuza series. I will talk about this in a little bit. Exactly.

514
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:34,580
But anyways, uh, it's, it's, if you're thinking like a dragon being like the other,

515
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:40,260
like a dragon game, uh, it's not, it's more of like an action brawler type thing. I thought

516
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,380
they were, I thought they were making the, uh, dragon quest RPG, the new standard. I thought

517
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:52,020
that was the thing moving forward. Uh, no, this one does not look like that at all. So if it is,

518
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:58,180
it's doesn't reflect it. The gameplay trailer does not reflect that. Interesting. Um,

519
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,700
Hogwarts legacy got a new trailer, um, supposed to be coming out February 10th,

520
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:09,540
uh, Pacific drive looks interesting. I'm sorry. I have to get this off my chest. I am so mad

521
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:16,340
that that dumb woman who wrote a book once ruined the, this series for me because I, you know,

522
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:23,060
I look at that and I go, huh, it looks neat, but like, I, I can't bring myself to care at all about

523
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,900
that universe whatsoever. And it just, it just stinks. It's just, and I under look,

524
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,740
there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. I get that people have to pick and choose their

525
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,420
own battles. There's going to be people that buy that game, whatever you do, you bestie.

526
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:41,540
But I just, I can't bring myself to give a hoot about that game. And I'm just so angry at that

527
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:46,980
dumb woman for what she did to her own franchise. Anyway, I just, I'm sorry. I have to get that off

528
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:54,340
my chest. Yeah. Um, Pacific drive looks interesting. It's kind of like a first person

529
00:49:54,340 --> 00:50:01,780
dystopian, like I guess a road trip type game. Um, it almost looks like the long drive, except if

530
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:08,260
it were a competent game and also had like weird stuff in there. Thank you. Chat room is clarified.

531
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,100
I didn't catch this, that you actually were talking about the two different games there.

532
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:18,260
Asian was a game that already existed. And so it was kind of like a, a precursor, if you will,

533
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:23,620
to you cause like a dragon that is not turn-based that because it wasn't in the series wasn't that

534
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:29,620
way, but now the mainline numbered games will be turn-based. So that's, that's what's going on

535
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:36,020
there. Cool. Thank you, Chad. Um, they talked a little bit about PlayStation stars, which is

536
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:42,740
their rewards program. That sounds like NFTs without saying that it's NFTs, but it's basically

537
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:50,180
you earn digital collectibles, which sounds so much like NFTs. And when they showed it,

538
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:56,420
it looks like NFTs, except I'm not sure if you can sell them. It's like, it's like, if you will,

539
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:03,060
um, the PlayStation trophies you would get in PlayStation home and being able to share like

540
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,300
little things that like, almost like achievements for that, but I'm not sure where you get these

541
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:13,300
from. And if you can trade them or whatever and sell them, then that sounds like NFTs, but it's

542
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,940
just stinks like NFTs right now. That was the exact same thing I was worried about when I first

543
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:25,060
heard about that. I was like, is this NFTs? Cause yikes. Uh, there's some. It smell like an NFT

544
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:32,820
and it looked like an NFT. Some third person, um, like power armor combat game, um,

545
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:41,380
called sin duality looked okay. Um, stellar blade kind of resembles a little bit of like a,

546
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:51,380
you know, anime, um, protagonist, dark souls type game. Looks neat, I guess, uh, rise of Ronan,

547
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:57,700
which is a new team Ninja game and, um, almost reminds me a little bit of an assassin screen

548
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:05,060
type thing, which, you know, neat, uh, got a war. Ragnarok has a controller that's coming out and

549
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:10,980
they also showed off a new story trailer as well for the game. And those are out in November.

550
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,700
And that was clearly the big thing that they were waiting to show off was, you know,

551
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,060
God of war. Cause that's going to be their big holiday title, obviously. So yeah.

552
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:26,020
Yeah. Is that game also on PS4? It is, isn't it? Yeah. Cause I guess technically they still don't

553
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:31,540
have PlayStation fives on target shelves. Although most people are saying they're relatively easier

554
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:36,900
to come by now than they were. So I still haven't seen them in stores. I have seen,

555
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,820
I think you still have to play the game a little bit, but you don't have to play it as hard as you

556
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:48,420
used to. Yeah. Like the Sony direct thing is a pretty reliable way to get them. I think is,

557
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:51,700
is what I'm hearing now. Yeah. I've been holding out. Cause I was going to see if

558
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,740
they were going to refresh them this year. That's what I thought might happen is there

559
00:52:54,740 --> 00:53:00,100
might be a refresh. Um, but now I'm just honestly, at this point, I'm holding off to it. Cause

560
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:06,260
this is what inevitably always happens, you know, and Sony really has nobody, but well,

561
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,700
I would say themselves, but the industry does this. It doesn't matter. You could be Microsoft

562
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:14,980
and this is a halo console console. You could be Nintendo and this is a splatoon three.

563
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:20,980
It's not even a halo console anymore. Uh, yeah, yeah, we, uh, not after last what's happened,

564
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:24,340
but you know what I mean? Or it could be a splatoon three console comes out and then

565
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:30,020
literally like the next week, a, uh, scarlet violet Pokemon one comes out like in Nintendo.

566
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:35,300
But my point is now I'm waiting to see if a final fantasy 16 PlayStation five or something branded

567
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:40,980
with that comes out. We did see there was the Ragnarok controller coming. That looked very

568
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:46,500
pretty, um, for that. So it just, it just seems like, and maybe it, because maybe it wouldn't

569
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,500
be in good taste to do a limited edition console while they're still hard to come by. I don't know.

570
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:56,260
Um, but they're not doing a full Ragnarok console at least as far as we know. So, but if they do a

571
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:01,140
sick, that's what I'm holding out for now. That's why I'm not getting a PlayStation five yet is that

572
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:06,260
number one, I have a computer now good enough to play pretty much anything. And Sony is putting

573
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:12,260
out most stuff on PC. Now, if final fantasy 16 is not same date on PC, which I'm not expecting

574
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:16,980
it to be, then I will get a PlayStation five just for that game because I am a fan boy.

575
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:25,860
Yeah. Um, another bit of information that wasn't necessarily included in the state of play, it's

576
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:31,300
come out that the PlayStation two VR will not be backwards compatible with the PlayStation one VR,

577
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,940
which makes sense when you think about it. Cause I mean, this is the system for tracking

578
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:41,620
controllers are completely different. Like it would be hard to retrofit all of that stuff

579
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:47,860
back in there to get that stuff all compatible. Um, yeah. When I first heard the news, I was like,

580
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:54,580
what the fuck? What a, what a, what a terrible thing to do, you know, that to close off the

581
00:54:54,580 --> 00:55:00,900
PlayStation VR one library. But then when I really sat down to think about it and read some followup

582
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:05,620
conversation, I was like, Oh yeah, they completely changed the tracking where there's actually no

583
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:11,620
camera that looks at you anymore. There's no more red and blue balls on the place that would

584
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:15,860
completely change the way that beat saber detection is working and things like that.

585
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:22,500
I'm sure many of the all star titles will be redone for play. I there, well, I keep saying

586
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,580
there will absolutely be a beat saber, but now that I think about it, that's all owned,

587
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:32,580
but I, they would be silly not to do it, but I guess anything's possible.

588
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,020
They are a silly company.

589
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,940
It's true. That is true. But Tetris effect, I imagine certainly will have a PSVR too.

590
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:43,780
I would see like, you know, and it's, it's good that we maybe get a, you know, a remaster of

591
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:48,180
until dawn rush of blood, you know, would be nice with some extra levels, please.

592
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:56,420
Yeah. So I understand why it's not backwards compatible. It stinks. You kind of wish there

593
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:00,980
was a way for them to just say, well, can't you just kind of have an easy translate emulate that?

594
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:06,580
No, it's not. It's not that easy, but hopefully it won't be too difficult for the all star games

595
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:13,220
to be repackaged. It does suck. But I mean, you can still play your PlayStation VR on the

596
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:19,460
PlayStation five, I think. So you just have to have the whole headsets. Yeah. And the camera

597
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:28,260
and the move controller. Yeah. There is all that. So what did you think overall of the PlayStation

598
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,780
state of play? Loki, were you, were you pleased with it? Were you kind of like,

599
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,700
I wish there'd been more or where were you at with that?

600
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:38,420
There's a lot of games I'm not really interested in, honestly. I mean, some of it looks good.

601
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:42,020
I've got a war. I haven't really played the last God of war game.

602
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:48,740
So I'm not super excited about it, but I know it's a good game. Yeah. I don't know.

603
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,700
Not really super excited about anything that they showed.

604
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:57,380
Um, I think the things that jumped out to me, um, even though I'm not a huge God of war person,

605
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:01,780
although, you know, it's new year, new me, anything can happen now, clearly based on my

606
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:06,500
gaming week. So never say never. Um, I think the games that really stood out to me, Pacific drive

607
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,300
looked kind of, it was very stylish and, you know, I like a good driving game,

608
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,540
although I understand there's more to it than that, but that, uh, the one that kind of surprised me,

609
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:23,300
was Demi-O, the one that was the tabletop RPG kind of in that VR space because I'm

610
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:29,540
admittedly not the Dungeons and Dragons and tabletop fan that a lot of other people are.

611
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:35,060
I'm certainly not a hater. I think it's a great creative outlet and like, maybe I just kind of

612
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:39,380
wish I had a group and I'd play it more regularly. I don't know. You know, that's on PC though.

613
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,500
Oh, the Demi-O? Yeah, it's already out on PC.

614
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:48,100
See, that's good to know. That's good to know. Uh, and then Tekken 8 looked, you know,

615
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,940
looks pretty, you know, even though we kind of, we kind of knew it was coming. Uh, it's,

616
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:56,740
it's still nice to have it confirmed and it looked very pretty. Um, you know, rain, rain and more

617
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:04,420
rain. Yes. All right. Um, going to chat a lot of comments on the, uh, PSVR stuff. Bobby, uh,

618
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:09,220
Black Wolf, who's on before us here at VOG Network says it's easier to write the new tracking into

619
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:13,460
your game than it is to build an entire emulation layer to translate what your game is looking for

620
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:19,220
into what the PSVR 2 is actually able to detect. Is it possible? Yes. Well, thank you for at least

621
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:23,940
putting that out there. Would it cost a lot of time and money? Yes. Would it be janky and not

622
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:30,180
a great emulation? Also, yes. And I do understand all that. It's just, I can't, yeah, I can't not

623
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:35,460
sit here and go, ah, it's a bummer, but I get it. I wonder though, if there is a possibility

624
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:40,340
for them, like say that a developer really wanted to like get their game to work with it, if they

625
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:47,060
could like add a compatibility with that stuff, like if they could just rewrite how it works or

626
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:52,420
something like that. I would imagine, I would imagine they've already reached out to the top 10

627
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:59,460
VR game makers and having those conversations. In fact, if you think about it, um, one of the games

628
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:07,140
that I know is very popular on PSVR is No Man's Sky and Hello Games some time ago announced that

629
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:13,540
there was going to be a PSVR 2 version before it was confirmed that it's not going to be compatible

630
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:18,420
with PS because there were some people going, well, yeah, of course there's going to be a VR 2

631
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:23,780
version. They're just going to take the VR 1 version and push the button differently. But now

632
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,380
now that we've all sat down and critically thought about it, oh wait, no, Hello Games is actually

633
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:33,460
going and making a PSVR 2 version of No Man's Sky. So, you know, there, I would say look at

634
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:37,860
the top 10 PlayStation VR games and Sony's probably having conversations and I would bet

635
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:44,500
dimes to dollars No Man's Sky is one of the top 10 games. So we already knew that's coming. So,

636
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:50,500
all right. Uh, let's see Zen Monkey 11 in chat says I'm a PlayStation VR owner and I'm happy

637
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:54,740
it's not backwards compatible. They needed to upgrade that thing. They better have better

638
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:59,620
lenses this time around. No one talks about how bad the lenses were on the PSVR, my main issue

639
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:05,540
with it. Yeah. So, I mean, you know, the, maybe it's just going to feel smoother, feel better,

640
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:10,740
you know, um, just as a device. And so maybe we need to leave the past in the past. I don't know.

641
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:17,300
So, all right. Uh, that was the PlayStation State of Play. Let's talk about now the Nintendo Direct

642
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:23,460
that also happened this week. By the way, neither of these things we knew were happening, although,

643
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:27,700
you know, with Tokyo Game Show this week, you should have probably anticipated it.

644
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:32,180
But we did get a Nintendo Direct that happened this week, and there was quite a few announcements

645
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:38,100
that were made in that as well. Fire Emblem Engage was announced. Fire Emblem is back,

646
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:43,860
and this is a new game in the series that will be out in January of 2023. It Takes Two,

647
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:48,820
which I believe was Game of the Year at the Game Awards last year, is now getting a Nintendo Switch

648
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:53,060
version. So that is coming out on November 4th. But of course, if you want to put down your money

649
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:58,340
for a pre-order, you can already do that now. Fatal Frame, Mask of the Lunar Eclipse.

650
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:03,380
This game was originally on the Wii. It was not released outside of Japan, but guess what? You

651
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:08,660
are getting an English version now in early 2023 on the Switch. And I know, Fatal Frame is

652
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:14,500
definitely one of those like cult hit series of games. So there's going to be some very specific

653
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:19,220
people out here that will be very happy with this news. So, um, congrats to the Fatal Frame fans.

654
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:24,420
Uh, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was just confirmed there's new content coming. That really shouldn't

655
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:29,220
be too much of a surprise, but Eno is coming in the second wave of the expansion pass,

656
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:33,540
and she has new abilities for the roster. There'll be new challenge battles and so on and so on.

657
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:39,220
October 13th is the day for all of that. Guess what? If you love SpongeBob SquarePants and who

658
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:43,060
doesn't love a good SpongeBob SquarePants reaction image, you have a whole new game,

659
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:47,860
the Cosmic Shake. It's a platformer with seven areas, and it's coming next year.

660
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:51,780
All the original voice actors, uh, will be participating in the game.

661
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:58,820
Uh, if you love Fist of the North Star, you can now play fitness boxing, or at least you will in

662
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:06,980
March, which is based on Fist of the North Star. It's basically a rhythm game. Wasn't this a game

663
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:11,140
already? Like, it was back when we did Bamani games.

664
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,900
I'm thinking of the Punch Mania version.

665
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,260
Is it, but was it Fist of the North Star related? The Punch-

666
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,140
No, but-

667
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,300
No, there was one that was Fist of the North Star.

668
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:25,460
Yes, because didn't we play it at Arcade Infinity once? Because when I saw this, I was like,

669
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:29,700
wasn't this at Arcade Infinity, like, years ago? Like, I swear this was a thing.

670
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:36,500
Okay, thank you in chat. Uh, Dartesia says, uh, Hokuto no Ken Punch Mania.

671
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,700
Hokuto no Ken.

672
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,900
Yeah, so-

673
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,580
Which is Fist of the North Star.

674
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:45,460
That's it. So I, okay, so this is kind of something we've seen before, but it's kind of

675
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:50,420
neat. Who thought you'd ever see this come back, right? So we're getting a lot of, like,

676
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:51,860
interesting Japanese revival.

677
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,060
It is a deep cut.

678
01:02:53,060 --> 01:03:00,900
It is a deep cut. This is a B side, but it's cool that it's getting the A treatment.

679
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:06,980
Then we had some farming simulators, starting with Oddballers. Oh no, I'm sorry, Oddballers.

680
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:07,780
No, that's a-

681
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:12,660
My bad. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Oddballers is multiplayer dodgeball. My list is off here.

682
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,380
Uh, that is coming out early next year.

683
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:19,940
Tunic is coming out on September 22nd. We already knew that game was coming,

684
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,620
we got a date for it though.

685
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:27,060
Front Mission 1 and 2. If you're a fan of these, uh, tactical games, uh, that is gonna be coming

686
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:31,220
out in 2023, and there'll be a third game in the series coming out eventually as well.

687
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,180
Now, Story of Seasons, A Wonderful Life, there you go.

688
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:38,340
Uh, there's your farming sim, uh, because don't you love farming sims?

689
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:41,460
Don't you want to play Feh Farm? Don't you want to play that as well?

690
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:48,180
Uh, Octopath Traveler 2. It's coming. It's a thing. It's happening. Eight new,

691
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:53,060
uh, travelers in this game. Uh, it's going to be, uh, taking place in a similar kind of

692
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:58,740
industrial time as the first game. Uh, so yeah, this will be, uh, interesting. It's gonna have

693
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:03,620
a time mechanic, which will mean you have different abilities between daytime and nighttime.

694
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:09,460
Uh, and this time, instead of the completely separate stories, traveler stories will intersect

695
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:13,380
earlier on in the game. February 24th, 2023 is when that's coming out.

696
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:20,580
Honestly, the biggest news for me, uh, and, uh, for anyone with taste, quite frankly,

697
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:27,700
Theatrhythm, final bar line is coming out. Yay. They are finally doing Theatrhythm on the Switch.

698
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:32,260
They're also doing it on PlayStation 4 and 5. It just wasn't a part of the direct,

699
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:38,740
but this makes me very happy. 385 songs from the Final Fantasy series,

700
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:45,460
and if that's not enough, how about 90 download songs? And if that's not enough, how about 27

701
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:50,820
additional songs in the digital deluxe edition? Pretty much, if it is a Square Enix song,

702
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:55,380
outside of Kingdom Hearts, because you have to play Melody of Mediocrity if you want to play the,

703
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,980
um, Kingdom Hearts songs. I think that's what it was called. At least in my head,

704
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,300
that's what it was called. Um, if you want to play the Kingdom Hearts songs, you got to go over

705
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:11,540
there. But, like, there's Nier songs in this, Chrono Trigger. I mean, am I going to drop $100

706
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:18,420
on the digital collector's edition of this? Honestly, probably. Sorry, not sorry, but,

707
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:25,700
again, we had this discussion earlier in the show. Am I a fanboy for Final Fantasy games? Yes.

708
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:30,260
Am I going to drop $100 for, like, 500 different songs across Squares?

709
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:34,020
You can't say that you're not getting your money's worth with 500 songs. Like,

710
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:37,860
if I said, oh, hey, I'm going to buy a DDR game with 500 songs in it, you'd be like,

711
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:44,100
damn, that's a good value. Exactly. Exactly. So, I'm excited. I'll be buying it, and I look forward

712
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:49,220
to playing with Bobby Blackwolf online, and many of you as well. Uh, Mario and Rabbids,

713
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:52,980
Sparks of Hope. We knew that there was a new Mario and Rabbids game. Now we know it's coming

714
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:58,500
on October 20th. Uh, Rune Factory 3 Special. If you were a fan of Rune Factory 3 on the DS,

715
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:03,300
you can have a special time on the Nintendo Switch in 2023.

716
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:09,060
Some new games announced for the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo Switch online. We will be seeing later

717
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:18,580
this year, Pilotwings 64 and Mario Party 1 and 2. And then in 2023, Mario Party 3, Pokemon Stadium

718
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:27,300
1 and 2, 1080 Snowboarding, and Excitebike 64. Oh, and one game that we never thought we would see

719
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:33,300
added to the service, because licensing is a bitch, but they got it worked out,

720
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:40,340
Goldeneye 007. That's right. The Nintendo 64 Classic Goldeneye is also coming out.

721
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:45,460
Now, what was interesting about this, even though they weren't having it direct at the same time,

722
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:52,020
Microsoft, you know, because of the rare connection, at the exact same time announced,

723
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:59,140
they are also getting a remastered version of the original Goldeneye on their platform. However,

724
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:05,540
it will not have online play. This version will because it's already baked into the emulator that

725
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:10,740
Nintendo put out online, but the one on Xbox, they're trying to focus the conversation on couch

726
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:16,820
co-op and all this stuff. Regardless, any way you slice it, this game was better in your memory than

727
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:22,820
it is now. I guarantee it. That game made me so sick I passed out. I'm serious.

728
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:28,500
And here's the other thing about it that maybe plays into this a little bit. Bobby brought up

729
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:35,780
a great point on his show. The standard for controlling first-person games now that Halo and

730
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:41,700
those games have established, this game did not control the same way. So to try to go back and

731
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:46,820
play a game like this after you've played the Halos, the Dooms, the other first-person games

732
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:52,500
of the world, it's not easy to go back and play Goldeneye. So again, I just want to remind you all

733
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:58,180
this game is better in your memory than it is now, but you know what? I bet you're excited anyway.

734
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:02,740
Go off, have fun, enjoy this game for the 15 minutes you'll play it before you move on to

735
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:07,140
something else once it comes out of the Nintendo 64 emulator. But if you're able to recreate that

736
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:15,300
magic of 1998 in your living room, you know what? Go off, have fun. So by the way, they already

737
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:21,380
redid Goldeneye on the Nintendo Wii in 2010. Do you remember that? But I think they had to take

738
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:26,100
out Pierce Brosnan's face and they may have replaced it with Daniel Craig. That was a whole

739
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:32,900
thing that they did. But does anyone remember they've already did and it didn't sell quite

740
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,300
because again, Goldeneye is better.

741
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:40,420
Well, that was Goldeneye Reloaded and it was awful because Activision did it and Activision

742
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:43,140
like half-assed it. So, you know.

743
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,100
We all know that the Goldeneye game was Brosnan's best role as Bond.

744
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:56,420
More games for the Nintendo Direct. Various Daylife, a new RPG for the Switch on from

745
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:01,540
Square Enix, and it's out now. I believe this was already out on mobile devices,

746
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,060
so it's not exactly new.

747
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:06,820
It's funny. Various Daylife sounds like it would be like a subreddit or something with

748
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:09,220
random pictures of people or something.

749
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,820
It was an Apple Arcade.

750
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:16,740
That's okay. That's why I thought it was a mobile title first. Actually, funny enough, you do chores.

751
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,740
I didn't get into it. I didn't really like it.

752
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:24,580
Yeah. You do chores in exchange for job classes. It almost sounds like, what was that level five

753
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:30,180
game? Actually, that game was super underrated though. It was like something life. Somebody

754
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:33,860
will know what I'm talking about in chat. It was a really underground favorite.

755
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:42,100
I think it was the 3DS or the regular DS, and it was a level five game and it never got a sequel.

756
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,420
Fantasy Life. Thank you. That's what it was.

757
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:46,980
That was the game I was trying to think of.

758
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,300
Factorio is coming out for Switch on October 28th.

759
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:58,260
IB is a 2D pixel art horror game coming out in the spring of 2023.

760
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:04,420
Mario Strikers Battle League. It's a new update for the already released Mario Strikers,

761
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:08,980
and Pauline and Diddy Kong are joining the roster. You can check that out later this month.

762
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:14,020
Atelier Ryza 3 is coming out as well, because it is Tokyo Game Show,

763
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:18,340
so why not have some Japanese RPGs? That'll be out on February 24th, 2023.

764
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:25,380
A reminder that there are Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course passes coming.

765
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:29,700
Merry Mountain and Peach Gardens from DS will be available this holiday,

766
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:34,580
so that is on its way out. Nintendo Switch Sports is getting golf,

767
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:36,500
because we knew they were going to be adding games to that.

768
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:44,020
Nintendo did a whole spotlight on Pikmin Bloom, which that game's been out, so well,

769
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,460
I know why they did a spotlight, because they need more people to be playing it.

770
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:53,220
And to be fair, they've made a lot of changes to that game from the first year,

771
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:58,660
and while I didn't love all the changes, I would say, especially the fact that you can now finally,

772
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:04,500
this change just went in a week ago, you can buy expansions and things like that with coins,

773
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,460
instead of having to pay the $2.99 to expand that type of stuff. You can now use the free to play

774
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:14,340
coins, although they're slow to get, but you can get them, to pay for that stuff. So that's a huge

775
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:18,900
quality of life change that they made that's a good thing right there. But anyway, they just,

776
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,420
they need more people playing the game. That's why they did a spotlight on it.

777
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:28,180
I'm surprised that they didn't walk back any pre-COVID changes or COVID changes that they had.

778
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,220
They didn't really make COVID changes to Pikmin Bloom.

779
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:35,300
Oh, they didn't. Well, how nice for Niantic to not do it for that game.

780
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:40,900
Yeah, right. All right. But that all led into a Pikmin 4 announcement. And that's

781
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:44,180
really all we know. We didn't get a screenshot or nothing. Pikmin 4 is coming.

782
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:49,140
No, I thought we got, oh no, that's right. It wasn't Pikmin. I thought we had like screenshots.

783
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,900
Oh, I thought it was like a concept thing. I didn't think it was like an actual screenshot.

784
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:55,300
I mean, okay. So maybe we did get a screenshot.

785
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:00,740
No, they have like some like test footage or whatever they're talking about. Like you're

786
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:03,700
going to be able to play the game from like the Pikmin perspective or something like that.

787
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:12,260
But at the same time, why are we getting another Pikmin game? F-Zero. F-Zero. We've already had,

788
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:16,660
like, we've already had two Pikmin games now in the time that we haven't had F-Zero.

789
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:23,140
And that is a crime. That is a hate crime. I will be writing my congresspeople tomorrow.

790
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,340
Just Dance 2023. Hello. You knew this game was coming because it's coming everywhere else.

791
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:35,300
November 22nd is the day. Harvest Ella because you love your farming games. There's a new demo

792
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,740
on the eShop that just came out if you want to check it out. And you can get the full game on

793
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:44,020
November 4th. You knew we were going to see Bayonetta 3. So it was nice to get a new peak

794
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:51,060
at that. And October 28th, again, is the day for that. Raincode Master Detective Archives. That is

795
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:55,860
Danganronpa. The people that made that game are making this game.

796
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:56,980
Like Jynsoft.

797
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:01,300
Yeah. So they are making this. So I'm sure some people will be checking it out based on that

798
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:07,620
alone. If you want to play Resident Evil, either Village or Biohazard, the seventh game, or the

799
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:12,420
two or three remakes, if you want to play those on the Switch, guess what? You can. But guess what?

800
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:17,220
They're cloud versions. So you have to have a constant internet connection for it to work.

801
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:24,900
But hey, you know what? Some people, they want to have it on their portable device,

802
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,660
even though they can't leave their house. But OK. It's going to be coming.

803
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:36,980
Sifu, a kung fu game coming out November 8th. Crisis Core, Final Fantasy VII Reunion.

804
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:43,220
I'm surprised this was in the Nintendo Direct and not in the PlayStation thing, but OK. December

805
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:50,900
13th is the day this is coming out. Radiant Silver Gun. That was kind of random and cool to hear.

806
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:55,620
That is out on the Switch right now. It was a It's Out Today port announcement.

807
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,340
I'm going to go get it now.

808
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:58,980
I thought you might have already picked it up.

809
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:02,900
Well, I haven't switched my Switch in a while.

810
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:08,980
Sorry, I know there's a lot of games. I'm almost done. Endless Dungeon. It takes place in an

811
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:13,140
abandoned space station. It's a procedurally generated roguelike for four players that's

812
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:17,860
coming out next year. Tales of Symphonia is getting a remaster. So if you're a Tales of

813
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:23,060
Fan, you can check that out. Life is Strange. The Arcadia Bay collection is coming to the Switch.

814
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:29,220
So this is, you know, some of the earlier Life is Strange games all repackaged. Lego Brick Tales.

815
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:32,500
You know, it's coming out everywhere. And of course, it's coming out on the Switch as well.

816
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:39,300
Romancing Saga. The minstrel song remastered. That is coming out on December 1st.

817
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:45,380
Disney Speedstorm. This game looks particularly interesting after the, you know, somewhat success

818
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:50,180
of the Disney Dreamlight Valley. This game is coming out on the Switch as well later this year.

819
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:55,220
The second season of Fall Guys already started. It started on September 15th.

820
01:14:55,860 --> 01:15:00,980
The Return to Dreamland Deluxe. Kirby's Return to Dreamland Deluxe. It's a remake of the

821
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:09,780
2011 Wii game. And this will be out on February 24th, 2023. All right. And then the big finale,

822
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:16,820
the big climax. Breath of the Wild 2 has a real name now. It is The Legend of Zelda,

823
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:23,220
Tears of the Kingdom, which some people have pointed out may have been the reason that the

824
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:28,580
Direct was delayed in Europe because of the passing of the Queen, the Tears of the Kingdom.

825
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:35,220
I don't know if there is any fact in that, but it is awfully interesting. But anyhow,

826
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:40,500
the game is officially called The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. That is the

827
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,740
sequel to Breath of the Wild. There was just a little peek because originally when it first

828
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:49,060
started playing, I was like, are they doing like a Skyward Sword thing? I was like, oh no,

829
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:52,260
it's Breath of the Wild. It's just got the Skyward, you know, all that in it. But we know

830
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:58,100
that's going to be in there with a glider and all that stuff. Also, we got a date May 12th,

831
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:05,540
2023. So the long, long, long wait for Breath of the Wild 2 or now as we know it Tears of the

832
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:14,020
Kingdom is almost over. So some thoughts in chat. Dark Tetsuya says, Yeah, that's what I was

833
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:19,060
thinking. Maybe a bit too close to home. Oh, interesting. Dark Tetsuya says radiant silver

834
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:23,940
apparently got pulled. The rating got changed. I don't know if it's back up yet.

835
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:28,900
That's interesting. So I didn't find it. That might be why it's not there yet. So you might

836
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,980
have to check again in a couple of days. That's interesting. I wonder what happened there. That's

837
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:41,220
a yikes. So yeah. Well, I'm sure it's coming back. But yeah, that is really random. So

838
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:45,220
and what would have changed about the rating? It's not like the game

839
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:52,420
had an excessive amount. I guess. All right. Anyway, let's move on. More and more stuff out

840
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:58,580
of Tokyo Game Show, I guess. And even though things leak, sometimes it doesn't stop the

841
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:02,740
news from coming and having the officialness behind it. But Dark Soccer, what do you got?

842
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:11,620
So I have, well, number one, I have been a big Street Fighter fan for a very long time,

843
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:20,020
and they have leaked the full roster, the launch day roster for Street Fighter 6. And that's more

844
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:28,020
than what they just have on their character page on the website. So the leaked list starts with

845
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:42,260
Aki or AKI, Akuma or Goki, Blanca, Kami, DJ, Dhalsim, Honda, Ed, JP, Judy, Ken, Kimberly.

846
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:48,740
Kimberly is cool. Okay, she's supposed to like, be like, I guess, guys version of Sakura.

847
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:50,100
Oh, neat.

848
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:59,700
Bushin Ryu fangirl. There's Lily, Marisa, Mimi, Rashid, and Zangief. And they've already

849
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:06,900
shown gameplay of Kami wearing her classic costumes. So the theory is that the classic

850
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:11,700
costumes are going to be in there. I'm going to our chat for some reactions,

851
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:14,980
because people have opinions on Street Fighter 6. I do too. I think it looks great.

852
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:21,860
Um, apart from how it looks, though, the control on it is it's kind of a weird fight system.

853
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,860
Interesting. I think a lot of the classic players aren't really going to care for it.

854
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:32,900
But I don't know. I don't know. It's just it's very simplified.

855
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:37,460
It's piquing my interest in a way five never did. So I'm curious.

856
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:43,140
I still think that Street Fighter 4 was up there with probably the pinnacle next to Alpha 2.

857
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:50,260
Oh, I love 4. 4 is yeah, I love 4. Going to chat twitch.tv slash vog network. Mike Deff says

858
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:54,740
Street Fighter 6 looks so good like leagues better than Street Fighter 5 did at launch. Yeah,

859
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:57,540
hard agree on that to be honest. Like all the color splashes,

860
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:05,380
though. I think that that that just is too overwhelming. But but yeah, and and dark test,

861
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:09,780
like dark Tetsuya said there is a closed beta. I've been lined up for it for a little bit.

862
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:19,460
Um, but it's gonna it lists the systems that will be available. So that's PS5, Xbox and Steam.

863
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:26,260
Sorry, Nintendo Switch fans, but it just can't unless they do a cloud version,

864
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:34,340
it probably just can't run six as well as the others can. All right. Well, let's move on.

865
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:41,060
Loki. Yeah, so apparently, the Sims 4 is going to be going free to play.

866
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:46,660
Which makes sense because they have so many expansions for it, they'd probably want to have

867
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:50,820
the base game available for free. So people can get hooked and buy all the expansions.

868
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:58,020
So that is going to be the case. It says Sims 4 will be free to download

869
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:01,460
across PC, Mac and consoles, October 18.

870
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:08,980
I love what Jason said in tonight's intro about this. He said it so well. He said,

871
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:14,500
EA has finally discovered the shareware system of the 1990s. And that it worked

872
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:20,740
that they give you the base for free. And then, like, you know, $1,000. There's a ton of DLC,

873
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:25,940
this game. There is so much and my son was addicted to he's not addicted to but he likes

874
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:29,620
playing the game. So he does spend like his steam money usually is going to

875
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:36,900
buying expansions for this game. Like he has a ton of the Sims 4 expansions. So it's

876
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:41,620
it's funny. And I've said this on the show before is I really think Dead by Daylight ought to do

877
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:46,820
the same thing. But if you think about it, like, they kind of keep giving away based dead by

878
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:54,500
daylight a lot, like whether it's you know, an epic game store giveaway or in Microsoft game pass,

879
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:59,540
you know, depending on if you consider that free or not. I think it was a Sony games. I almost

880
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:03,540
said games with gold. That's not what they call it. PlayStation Plus, I think I think I have an

881
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:08,020
epic. Yeah, it was when it launched an epic store. They gave it away for free that week. So like,

882
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:10,740
Dead by Daylight is one of those games where I also think they ought to just give away the

883
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:14,420
base game for free because you know, they're making their money off battle passes and DLC.

884
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:21,380
But they kind of think it's it's pretty easy to get for free if you just pay attention,

885
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:24,580
you know, and follow, you know, those discount Twitters and stuff.

886
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:31,220
By the way, about Sims 4, I still have a lot of my mods from the Sims resource.

887
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:33,460
If your son wants them.

888
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:37,380
Well, I was actually kind of curious on your take Dark Sakura because you know,

889
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:41,380
some of the longtime listeners of the program remember you being quite the Sims fan,

890
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:45,220
as Joan Hunter-Matton chat says, I remember the early years of the show about Jamie modding the

891
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:49,860
hell out of Sims. So I'm kind of curious, is this something I mean, is have you just kind of

892
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:51,620
kind of gone past this franchise or?

893
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,780
I got bored and I got tired of paying for different things.

894
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:03,540
I'll be honest, I mean, I never really actually played the game, I would just build houses

895
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:07,780
and make them as funky as I could. And then I would be bored.

896
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:08,280
Yeah.

897
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:15,540
I it was all just like the building element for me, you know, designing doing my character creation

898
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:23,380
and my old PC would be like, how many more mods are you going to stuff in this game before I die?

899
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:25,060
And there's there's.

900
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,340
Oh, watch.

901
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:31,700
There's nothing wrong with deciding that, oh, OK, I'm kind of done with this game series for now.

902
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:37,380
I'm into this thing now. You know, friendship ended with Sims. Now Dead by Daylight is my

903
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:40,180
new best friend. It's just it's OK.

904
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:45,620
I would go back to like I went to Sims for a bit after it came out

905
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:55,700
and like I would make different Sims for people, you know, and I don't know, I just I got meh.

906
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:57,160
Yeah.

907
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,860
And like then I was like my other thing I would do in that game was like, look for real buildings

908
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:09,220
and try to recreate them, like, you know, like carriage houses, because I used to have this

909
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:15,620
dream that I would live in a carriage house. And so I made it in the Sims and then I make like

910
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:21,620
underground labyrinthine, you know, secret laboratories and shit and torture dungeons.

911
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:23,160
All right.

912
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:24,200
Yeah.

913
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,000
All right.

914
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:25,880
Alas.

915
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:29,700
I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next story because we are running a little long tonight,

916
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:33,700
so I'm going to do this one quickly because Loki kind of already talked about it,

917
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:38,180
but that's OK. I just want to mention quickly that they did confirm that Like a Dragon Eight

918
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:42,580
is coming out, and this is essentially for all intents and purposes Yakuza eight.

919
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:46,340
Let me talk about the difference in a moment. I'm sure some of you are already typing it in chat.

920
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:52,580
I will mention it in a moment. RGG Studio did a special presentation as part of Tokyo Game Show,

921
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:57,700
and they put out a teaser trailer and they did confirm the sequel is coming in 2024

922
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:05,860
on PlayStation, Xbox and PC. Kazuma Kiryu and Ichiban Kasuga are both in a dual protagonist

923
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:10,980
role in this game, with Kazuma supporting a Silver Fox hairstyle that will be explained in

924
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:16,740
the storyline as part of it. They referred to the game as an RPG, but outside of that, we don't know,

925
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:22,180
you know, specifically the gameplay style. They are saying it is the largest scale Yakuza or Like

926
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:28,420
a Dragon title to date. It will be available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so it is scale downable

927
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:33,300
for whatever that is worth. Also during the showcase, they did announce Like a Dragon

928
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:37,700
Isshin and Like a Dragon Gaiden, the man who erased his name. Both those games are coming

929
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:45,380
as well. So why is this Like a Dragon eight and not Yakuza eight? Well, it's basically because

930
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:53,380
Yakuza Like a Dragon was kind of like, ironically, also the seventh game in the series was kind of

931
01:24:53,380 --> 01:25:00,180
like Resident Evil Biohazard. Like a Dragon is sort of what the series has been called in Japan

932
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:05,700
for years, not literally, but that's roughly what it translates to. But when they released the games

933
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:10,820
over here in the States, they gave it a new name to kind of fit in with a lot of the competing games

934
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:15,060
that were coming out at the time. They wanted it to have like the whole Japanese crime drama stuff,

935
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:21,620
so they called it Yakuza. And so that all happened that way. But now with Like a Dragon eight,

936
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:26,100
they are going to bring it in parody, basically. And so now, and I think this probably is going to

937
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:31,540
have to do with the style of the game changing as well. If they're talking about the RPG and

938
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:38,260
everything I had heard before, I thought they were going to keep the Like a Dragon seven stuff in it.

939
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:43,060
I hope they do because I far prefer that to the fighting game style of the earlier games. But

940
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:51,140
that's it. Yep, they're going to just closely align that with the Japanese name. So I'm very

941
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:56,180
curious to see more about Like a Dragon eight. And I'm sure people want to know,

942
01:25:56,180 --> 01:26:04,740
am I going to finish Like a Dragon seven? We'll see. We'll see. I'm kind of,

943
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:10,260
friendship ended with Like a Dragon. Now Assassin's Creed Odyssey is my new best friend.

944
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:20,900
For now, I'm sure it'll change next week as it always does. All right. Moving on, Dark Sakura.

945
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:26,740
So, you know, I'm actually still wondering when I'm going to get my Dead by Daylight board game,

946
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:33,460
but it's not the only video game getting board games. Team Forged Games is doing

947
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:40,980
an Elden Ring board game. So it'll have miniatures of the game's enemies, the bosses,

948
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:53,700
Margit the Fel Omen. Sorry. But it will basically let one to four quote,

949
01:26:53,700 --> 01:27:04,100
tarnished players go through their adventures on the board game. And a quote is that it's,

950
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:08,020
the game, the video games characteristically challenging fights will be recreated by

951
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:13,860
intelligent dice-free combat, requiring players to strategize and adapt their plans during each

952
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:20,580
encounter, whether that be a lowly Godric soldier or the Grafted King himself. I don't know what

953
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:30,900
they mean by dice-free, so maybe it'll use cards, but the Kickstarter. But the Kickstarter page

954
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:35,940
doesn't even have a date on it. It's just the Elden Ring board game. I'll link it in chat,

955
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:40,820
but it's just like, hi, we're doing this thing at some point.

956
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:46,020
Popular video games often get board games, but it's, I mean, that's not to say they're lesser

957
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:50,900
than or bad. You know, like I have some friends that love the Civ board game. Civilization has

958
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:56,100
a board game. They love it. So yeah, just pencil. I'd be curious to check out the Dead by Daylight

959
01:27:56,100 --> 01:28:01,380
one when you get yours. I need to follow up on that. I don't know. I haven't heard anything

960
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:03,860
since I confirmed all my stuff for it. Interesting.

961
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:07,700
All right. Let's move on to some bummer news, Loki.

962
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:16,100
Yeah, we have more layoffs. So Fanbyte, which is a Tencent-owned gaming site, I guess,

963
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:23,460
they have fired staff without warning. And apparently according to a Fanbyte employee,

964
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:32,980
the layoffs were total shock. And some of those, some that had just been laid off, had been only

965
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:40,820
given like an hour notice. And also they said that I don't know the total number of employees

966
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:46,340
that were laid off there, but there were at least several mentioned that had lost their jobs.

967
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:51,220
It was most of the staff. It sounds like they're keeping people that do the evergreen content,

968
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:54,660
like strategy guides and stuff like that. And that's probably where they're going to

969
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:59,060
try to get their hits. But it sounds like the news part of it is, from what I'm gathering,

970
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:04,420
I have a Twitter buddy who was impacted with this and it's a bummer to hear about.

971
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:15,140
Yeah. And then was it G4 TV also laid off 20 to 30 staff members as well. Now this doesn't

972
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:19,140
mean that they're going to be cutting down on content. They're going to still be producing the

973
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:25,060
same slate of content. It's just, they said this was due to unforeseen, well, I'm sorry,

974
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:30,660
this was due to their growing, I guess. They said it ebbs and flows something to that.

975
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:32,260
They're growing so they have to cut back.

976
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:34,900
Yeah. I don't understand how that works.

977
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:40,420
The Comcast board isn't making enough money, so we have to get it from somewhere.

978
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:48,740
I don't know. Like I haven't really been following G4 to be honest. I know that sounds

979
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:53,700
harsh. I know people that are there too. I'm sorry. Again, it's not a reflection on anyone

980
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:56,660
or anything personally, but it is one of those things where it's like, I just think

981
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:05,620
a TV channel like that now, the world in 2022 is not what it was in 2000. What was the merger of

982
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:12,260
tech TVs, 2006 or something like that? It's not the same world. It's pre-YouTube, pre-Twitch.

983
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:15,620
Like it's a different world we live in now.

984
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:20,980
You know, and it was, yeah, it was just back then it was easier to see it because

985
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:26,660
it was like having an exclusive YouTube channel, a single YouTube channel that basically gave you

986
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:30,900
your gaming news. And so, yeah, it was super popular because there wasn't really anything

987
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:36,660
out there like that outside of like gaming magazines. But nowadays with the internet,

988
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:41,140
anybody out there, there's so many outlets, anybody could give you the gaming news.

989
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:46,260
G4, isn't G4 also kind of a pain in the ass to watch? Like you have to have the special

990
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:52,340
Xfinity internet channel box or something to get it. Like I know some content is online,

991
01:30:52,340 --> 01:31:02,500
but it almost feels like it's hard to get a hold of anyway. I don't know. But honestly,

992
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:06,180
I'm not really looking for it except for some of the viral moments, which actually,

993
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:13,220
and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, there are a lot of the internet that blames it on the one

994
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:18,740
rant the woman made about misogyny in quotes. Well, when you insult your audience, then expect

995
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:27,620
to get laid off. In the words of the wonderful Gordon Ramsey, oh, fuck off. Like just shut up,

996
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:31,060
Twitter. You do not know what the fuck you're talking about because number one,

997
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:38,900
did she get laid off? I don't think so. And number two, that was actually the moment that

998
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:45,940
made me go, oh, I should be paying attention to this over here. G4 probably needs more viral

999
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:54,260
moments like that to be quite honest. So armchair critics who can't stand hearing the truth,

1000
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:56,660
if you can't stand hearing the truth,

1001
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:05,540
just don't. Yeah. It's just, it's a hard sell nowadays, especially with cable stuff. Like most

1002
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:11,300
people are cutting cable and even just still like scream, scream into the void of your three actual

1003
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:17,620
followers and your 45 Russia bots. God, like, like I've got like Comcast cable. I don't have their

1004
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:22,340
box obviously. Cause why would I pay extra for their stupid box? Um, so there's like, yeah,

1005
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:28,180
I don't even know how we'd watch their content outside of what I see like on Twitter. Um,

1006
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:33,460
and even then I'm like, not really motivated to watch any of it. Like I used to love G4, but like,

1007
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:37,940
yeah, I used to, that was a long time ago. Now there's other things I like watching.

1008
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:44,420
So it's hard. Zen monkey 11 in chat. Sorry. I just want to Zen monkey 11 and chat says

1009
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:49,940
G4 viewers since relaunch. Uh, they are on Twitch, YouTube, Pluto TV. They're on everything.

1010
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:55,380
You can watch Pluto and watch. They do the shows live on Twitch and YouTube.

1011
01:32:55,380 --> 01:33:00,980
Uh, and then tiger class says it's on YouTube TV and Pluto TV has a channel called G4 TV select.

1012
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:06,340
See, but that's like, I have to be honest. Like it sounds like it's completely different on YouTube,

1013
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:12,260
Twitch, maybe those are the same thing, but then we have G4 TV select. So that sounds different

1014
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:16,180
than, than the actual station like that. Like, look, and I'm not, again, I'm not knocking it.

1015
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:20,020
I'm not knocking the fans, but I'm just saying that's a little confusing.

1016
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:26,020
Then G4 TV. Is that like live TV or is that just like replaying the old shows?

1017
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:30,820
It sounds like replaying the old shows, but do I really know? I don't know. Uh,

1018
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:34,740
Bobby black Wolf and chat says my mom's house has it. And I turned it on once attack of the

1019
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:39,140
show was on and it looked like a podcast being recorded. Three people sitting around mics and

1020
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:49,780
laptops. Well, now who would watch that? But to be fair, I think a lot of pandemic stuff

1021
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:54,020
kind of changed that, but grant, I get it's 2022. And you know, a lot of that stuff's about.

1022
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:00,820
Wasn't the show that they had, um, didn't they have a show with, um, Scott Rubin

1023
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:05,780
that was three people around microphones or something like that. Wasn't like the G4 TV.

1024
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:11,060
I don't remember what it was called, but they were all in the same room.

1025
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,500
Remember when it was cool to do that?

1026
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:16,100
Oh, it's all remote now still. Right.

1027
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:20,100
I think, well, I don't think there is a G4 TV show anymore.

1028
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:26,900
Bobby black was talking about attack of the show, which was the, essentially the spinoff of, um,

1029
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:32,020
thank you. Screen savers. I was like Leo, the poor tech TV. Yeah. That one,

1030
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:36,500
not, not the other one, which that, that other show that Scott was on with the, um,

1031
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:40,340
the gals that went to go work at Microsoft, uh, that that show has been long gone.

1032
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:44,500
I miss this. I mean, I don't miss the screen savers. Cause I know that, that I think that

1033
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:48,740
still exists or maybe it doesn't exist. They, they had it a new, the new screensavers at one time,

1034
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:54,260
but I don't watch that anymore. But, um, man, I miss the old screen savers though,

1035
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:59,620
that that was some good TV. Uh, Zen monkey 11 says, think of it like big brother.

1036
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:03,140
You have the live feeds with all the cool content like Twitch and YouTube.

1037
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:07,940
And then you have the CBS show Comcast. That's actually actually Zen monkey to give you credit.

1038
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:13,380
That's a great way of putting it. And maybe that's the kind of approach G4 needs to take

1039
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:16,180
and marketing it. So I'm not saying they have to literally compare themselves to big brother,

1040
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:21,540
but maybe, you know, the uncensored stuff is online. I don't know. Or maybe they're doing it.

1041
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:25,540
And I'm just not, I'm too old to be the target marketing demographic. And I've never seen these

1042
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:30,180
ads. I don't know, but I'm just, just thinking this landscape, I'm not going to be surprised

1043
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:37,860
that they fold in three years. Like honestly, like it's hard, you know, like, um, I don't know,

1044
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:43,380
but like, I would not be surprised if that happens because it's just, it's like trying to keep a

1045
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:49,380
gaming magazine up in this day and age. It's just, you can't, you can't compete with it.

1046
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:54,580
And I'm sorry, like, like their, their personalities are great. Like I love,

1047
01:35:54,580 --> 01:36:00,820
you know, Adam, um, what was it? Uh, I love Adam. What's his name? Sessler.

1048
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:06,260
Sessler. Yes. Sorry. I had all these other names. I'm like, it's, it's not Sandler. Don't say

1049
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:14,180
Sandler. I know it's not a Sandler. Like I can see his face. Um, yeah. Adam Sussler. Um, you know,

1050
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:20,820
I just, I don't know. Like, like I was fine with it being gone and just like keeping up with him

1051
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:25,460
on Twitter and stuff instead. Like I just don't need it to come back. But like, I mean,

1052
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:30,420
it has its fans, you know, Zen monkey saying it's been around like three years. They're good. People

1053
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:34,100
don't just didn't know cause they weren't on cable. So they need cable in a way at

1054
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:42,740
that part. I disagree with, there are cable is a dying brand. So this is why I would say it's good

1055
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:49,300
that G4 has a presence on places like Pluto TV, streaming things like, like YouTube and Twitch

1056
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:55,620
and so forth. Cable television is about to be a thing of the past. And once 5g is more widely

1057
01:36:55,620 --> 01:37:01,460
available, that's going to be the death knell for cable. So that is where G4 is doing the right

1058
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:06,740
thing by being on these other places as well for when cable inevitably dies. It's going to.

1059
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:12,180
So, you know, just wait. All right. Anyhow, we got to move on with the show. Uh, I don't want to,

1060
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:14,820
I don't want to be here all night, but you know, I'm finding here a little bit of the night,

1061
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:19,700
but I want to talk about the sweet code and HD remaster, which came a little bit out of left

1062
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:24,500
field. I don't think people were really expecting this. Uh, Konami put on a show at Tokyo game show.

1063
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:29,620
They talked about a beloved series, uh, worldwide coming back and many people assumed it was going

1064
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:36,340
to be silent Hill. Although I sure didn't, but I did think Konami would say it was something else.

1065
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:41,140
I'd be like, Oh, it's gyrus come in, which I do love gyrus, but I thought that was what they

1066
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:44,500
were going to do is like, Oh, it's like, or Contra or something that they've already tried to relaunch

1067
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:49,060
and relatively recently, I actually think it's pretty cool. They are bringing back sweet code.

1068
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:53,220
And it's not just sweet code. What the whole, they started just talking about sweet code one.

1069
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:57,300
And then it was like, Oh, but it's sweet code and two as well. So it's a sweet code and one and two

1070
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:04,580
HD remaster it's coming out for PlayStation four X-Box one switch and PC in 2023. A lot of people

1071
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:10,180
have aptly noticed. Wow. Right around the time I had in Chronicles is also set to release. Isn't

1072
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:16,980
that interesting? Um, so, you know, we've seen some of the, uh, we've seen a trailer,

1073
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:21,860
we've seen that there's graphical improvements. There's new like lighting cloud, shadow animation,

1074
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:25,860
new character drawings, sound improvements. They're saying game system improvements and

1075
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:32,260
so on and so on. This is all fine and good. I I'm very happy to see sweet code and getting love

1076
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:36,980
because this series has needed love for a long time. It's a real bummer that Konami kind of let

1077
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:44,260
it die off. Like they did just about everything else because Konami sucks. That is also why I'm

1078
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:51,300
concerned is that in all of this announcement and hype and stuff, I didn't see any other logos.

1079
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:58,900
And what that means is I didn't see digital clips and two or any of these other companies who are

1080
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:03,780
using Inti creates or these companies that are kind of used to taking older games and making

1081
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:10,020
them HD. None of that. So this appears to be a Konami in-house production.

1082
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:24,900
Now I'm going to hit, someone hit the lever, this wrong lever show time. Now look,

1083
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:31,860
the Suikoden fans, and there are many out there and they are passionate, are quick to say that

1084
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:38,420
the trailer looks good and I'm sure everything will be fine. Look, I'm rooting for this game.

1085
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:42,980
I really am. Believe me, no one wants to see this game succeed more than me. Okay,

1086
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:46,660
maybe a lot of people want to see this game succeed as much as me, but I really do want

1087
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:54,820
this to be good. However, if I have concerns that the company behind the the notorious game

1088
01:39:54,820 --> 01:40:02,660
E-Football is doing this HD remaster, I have every fucking right to be concerned about this

1089
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:09,300
game. The Secret of Mana HD remaster looked really cool at first as well. They did an HD

1090
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:15,380
port of Final Fantasy 6 for mobile devices before the pixel remasters. And do you remember the,

1091
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:22,820
they were bad, but they looked all right in the trailer. So look, I'm just saying I'm going to

1092
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:29,300
need to see some reviews, some serious gameplay. I'm going to need to see a little more about what

1093
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:34,740
this game actually looks like before I really get excited because the fact that Konami is developing

1094
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:43,300
it in-house, yeah, sorry. It's a red flag for me at this point. Especially considering that even

1095
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:51,940
like more polished studios like Rockstar Games, for example, some of the stuff that they've

1096
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:59,140
remastered hasn't turned out well because of the quality of employees that they put in that,

1097
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:03,460
or your companies that they hired to do that. So Christ, I don't know, Konami in-house.

1098
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:08,980
Orange right hit the nail on the fucking head. I can't even believe I didn't think of this one.

1099
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:16,820
The most obvious Konami HD remaster to raise every red flag you own. I was looking forward

1100
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:27,300
to the Silent Hill HD remaster and then it happened. I mean, case point, the prostitution

1101
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:40,900
rests. That's it. Anyway, so yes, I have concerns. I hope I'm wrong. I really do. I hope Konami paid

1102
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:46,180
somebody a lot of money to secretly help them. I really do. They don't have a lot of money to pay

1103
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:54,500
anybody. And that's my concerns. All right. Anyway, let's go back maybe to a simpler time

1104
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:59,540
in our next segment. You know, back in a time like when Konami actually made good games.

1105
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:02,340
So long ago.

1106
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:15,780
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1107
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:20,660
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

1108
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:27,460
But once a month Dark Sakura says I'm doing a handheld, not a game. So what's the handheld Dark

1109
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:40,740
Sakura? They're games. I mean, yeah. Anyway, we are doing the series, the Tomitronic 3D. They

1110
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:49,860
kind of look like view masters, but longer and more spaceship sort of. And they have a light

1111
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:55,700
panel on top. Well, just like a translucent panel on top that lets light come in and illuminates the

1112
01:42:55,700 --> 01:43:03,460
screen. And there were seven games released. There was, and they had different names. So we had

1113
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:13,700
Sky Fighters, also known as Dog Fight and Tandy Sky Duel. We had Thundering Turbo, also known as

1114
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:22,900
Cosmos LeMans Turbo Racer and Thundering Turbos. Sky Attack, AKA Tank Attack. Shark Attack or Jaws

1115
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:30,580
3D. Planet Zeon, AKA Space Laser War, Space Attack. Then Jungle Fighter and Sherman Attack.

1116
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:42,420
The names really varied on their regions. But basically the game was just built right into

1117
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:51,060
the system. It was actually a fairly decent mock-up of 3D the way that they had it set up.

1118
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:58,260
In fact, I think that the one we're looking at right now is one of the turbo ones. And I think

1119
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:05,140
that it looked pretty good for its time. Here's the Tank Attack. I think I have another one of

1120
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:15,300
the variation for the Sky Attack. But I think that the games, for when they came out, it was

1121
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:25,060
as close to actual VR as we were going to get. And it was, in 1983, this was the first dedicated home

1122
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:38,340
3D hardware. So it used twin LCD monitors. And I mean, for 1983, it was something else.

1123
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:43,860
It was something else. And you can see that probably some of the influence of this came from

1124
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:50,100
a lot of the different sci-fi around the time. Like Tron had come out around then.

1125
01:44:50,660 --> 01:45:00,980
So, but I don't know. I think it's something that people need to remember that without this,

1126
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:08,420
where would we have our Wipeout and our other games like that.

1127
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:16,580
Yeah, stuff like this was like the shit in the early 80s. It was so cool. If you had one of

1128
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:22,660
these, I don't remember this one particularly, but obviously there are several electronic

1129
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:30,500
handhelds in a similar vein, we'll say, from in the 80s. And even now I'm looking at the ones that

1130
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:34,020
have the Tron aesthetic to it that you were just talking about, we were just seeing in the video.

1131
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:38,580
And I'm like, that game looks cool. I would have been the coolest kid in school if I had

1132
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:43,860
that in the 80s and brought that to school. It really does give you the sense of depth

1133
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:53,860
and motion, even though it's, and the light is all coming from outside, just linking on the

1134
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:58,020
screen. I was reading that people would come and put their hands over it and then you couldn't see

1135
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:10,980
the game. But I mean, there it is, the Tommytronic 3D from 1983. And I made the video myself,

1136
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:14,420
you're welcome. There you go. So for those watching on Twitch tonight with the video,

1137
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:18,260
or if you're in the archives, which are subscribers, it is September after all,

1138
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:23,140
so I should give a shout out for our subscribers over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork. You can go

1139
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:27,620
back and watch an old episode anytime if you want. If you want to see the video or what have you,

1140
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:36,260
that's available as a bonus to subscribers in our archive. And Amazon Twitch is currently having a

1141
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:41,300
sale on subscriptions for September. So now is as good of a time as any to get on that.

1142
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:45,940
And if you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you already get one free subscription a month. So

1143
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:50,420
if you're not already using that to help your favorite indie creator, why don't you consider

1144
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:59,140
using it over at Vognetwork? For the record, I remember hearing of someone who took a little

1145
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:04,180
flashlight and taped it on top of their thing so they could play at night under the covers.

1146
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:12,100
Oh, the systems we had when we were kids to play things. Same thing with the original Game Boy.

1147
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:16,660
It's like remember, remember the original Game Boy did not have any type of backlight or anything

1148
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:21,460
like that. But they actually sold like those screen magnifiers with a shitty little light

1149
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:26,260
that you could like clip onto the top of the DS. And all it did was make glare. I used to just

1150
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:32,020
sneak into the bathroom and play at night. That's great. Or the snake light says orange,

1151
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:36,820
right? Oh, yeah. God, those are terrible. But we did what we did what we had to do.

1152
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:41,540
Well, you know, my my GBA had we finally put the afterburner in it.

1153
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:47,780
Because mine was the clear pink one, which I just got for, you know, being a little, you know,

1154
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:55,300
ironic. It made my whole system glow. I love those Game Boy advances with the afterburners in them

1155
01:47:55,300 --> 01:48:03,460
looked so good. So good. Yeah. Yeah, I think that Tim did all of our our friend Tim did all of our

1156
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:09,300
upgrades for our GBAs. I had a different friend who I haven't talked to in a very,

1157
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:12,900
very long time. Unfortunately, he used to hang out in the earlier days, OLR. But just, you know,

1158
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:16,500
if we grew apart or whatever, who did mine? I think it was like a birthday present at one point.

1159
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:24,660
So, yeah. All right. Anyhow, let's travel around and check out some other news going on in the

1160
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:31,620
industry. Some rapid fire news. Loki will start with the US. I'm sorry, not my eyes were on world

1161
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:35,300
release dates. We can start with some news from the US too, though, if you want. I don't know

1162
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,220
where this news is from. But once you get to it,

1163
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:43,780
well, it's it's gonna be or not. I mean, so in this case, I guess it's sort of from the US

1164
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:51,780
because it's about the Xbox Game Pass. So Deathloop it's been almost a year now. You know

1165
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:57,940
what that means? Exclusive contract is up with Sony. So now it's coming to Xbox Game Pass on

1166
01:48:57,940 --> 01:49:03,140
September 20th. And it's also going to have a new content update called Golden Loop, which comes out

1167
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:10,740
the same day, adding new abilities and extended ending and secrets. And also, Deathloop will be

1168
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:18,820
getting added to PlayStation Plus Extra as well. Yeah, so that's cool. I'll have to check it out

1169
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:25,460
when it comes out. And then this is kind of funny. I actually saw a clip of this on Twitter.

1170
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:32,980
It's Rose and Camellia. It is a game about slapping, or it's ladies slapping each other.

1171
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:39,860
And it's Japanese only. With gloves. Well, some of them have gloves. I think most of them have

1172
01:49:39,860 --> 01:49:45,540
gloves. Gloves slap, baby gloves slap. Anyone? Remember when the Simpsons was good? Anyone?

1173
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:52,260
All right. So it was a game. It's been out for a long time. I think

1174
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:58,980
it's been, it's a Japanese game. So it is only coming out on the Switch there,

1175
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:05,220
but it's hilarious because you use the Switch Joy-Cons to actually do the motion control for

1176
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:10,020
the slap, which is hilarious. That's why I wanted to mention it. All right.

1177
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:14,900
Dark Sakura, please don't slap me with a glove while you do your rapid fire story.

1178
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:22,900
Well, there is a Gran Turismo movie with David Harbour being produced and Orlando

1179
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:34,020
Bloom has joined the cast. So that's really it. Although he's also, his character is going to be

1180
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:41,220
a marketing executive who loves motor sports and Harbour is playing a retired driver who teaches

1181
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:49,380
a young person to be a race car driver. I also have another little thing real quick.

1182
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:56,820
Yeah, sure. Someone put out a mod for Mass Effect 2 called the Nos Astra

1183
01:50:57,780 --> 01:51:05,540
a Nos Astra mineral exchange that lets you actually have a stock market for your mined goods

1184
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:12,180
created by Team Pyjak and Bekatoria. It's on Nexus.

1185
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:14,580
All right. It's for the legendary edition.

1186
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:20,820
All right. All right. Well, I don't know why I'm talking about this in rapid fire news,

1187
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:25,540
because this is right up your alley, Dark Sakura. I'm sorry. This thing has your name

1188
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:30,100
all over it. Oh, I've already known about it and linked it to Dan.

1189
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:35,540
So for everybody else, here's what I'm talking about. It is yet another

1190
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:40,900
console mini coming out, but what obscure shit are they going to do next?

1191
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:48,980
Obscure here. Yes, obscure here. Key point. But in Japan, after all, it is Tokyo Game Show week,

1192
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:58,020
they have announced that the X68000 is going to be getting a mini. It's the X68000Z. It's about

1193
01:51:58,020 --> 01:52:00,900
two-fifths the scale of the original machine. And this is a machine-

1194
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:02,020
This is a Suzuki.

1195
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:07,460
Yeah. And it never came out here in the States, as we've referenced before. And not only is there

1196
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:15,140
the small model there, you can even get a mouse and keyboard for it. Yeah, exactly. This is a

1197
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:24,180
system that came out in Japan in March of 1987. This was the home of some arcade perfect ports

1198
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:30,340
like Parodius, Final Fight, Ghouls and Ghosts, Castlevania Chronicles. This was the original

1199
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:35,060
platform for that. There was a remake of Castlevania on the NES with updated visuals.

1200
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:40,020
They did put it on the PlayStation later, but still, it was really cool that this is out there.

1201
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:49,300
So yeah, this is awesome. Again, for the US, extremely niche thing, but for those in the know,

1202
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:51,780
very cool. Very cool.

1203
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:55,140
And it looks like it's coming out on the 8th.

1204
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:58,820
Yeah, it's coming out really soon, all things considered.

1205
01:52:58,820 --> 01:52:59,220
Yeah.

1206
01:52:59,220 --> 01:53:00,740
I like how it has a clarion handle.

1207
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:04,020
Oh, because the original did.

1208
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:05,860
Yeah. This is awesome.

1209
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:08,180
I need-

1210
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:12,580
I know. I kind of want it too, even though I wish-

1211
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:14,500
We need someone to order it for us.

1212
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:21,780
We need a collective sugar daddy or mommy or person.

1213
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:25,540
I'm trying to see how much it's going to be because I don't know that it's going to be

1214
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:28,180
super... Okay, there we go.

1215
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:31,860
Well, it would depend if you get the keyboard, mouse and all the bells and whistles.

1216
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:37,620
I'm looking at the limited edition to see what the price isn't anywhere on the blog.

1217
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:39,940
I don't think that's a mouse. I think that's a trackball.

1218
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:40,900
It is.

1219
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:42,260
Oh, my bad.

1220
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:48,820
Sorry, they used the mouse emoji and that's what it translated to, so that's what I read. Sorry,

1221
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:49,460
but yeah.

1222
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:50,500
It looks like a trackball.

1223
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:52,580
Yeah, it's a really oddly shaped mouse.

1224
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:53,060
Yeah.

1225
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:57,380
The price isn't on here. Hold on. Let me look at the tweet real quick.

1226
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:02,740
Well, let me just read some comments over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

1227
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:05,860
Dark Tetsuya says, this is cool. I want one. Fingers crossed-

1228
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:07,300
That's the announcement date, by the way.

1229
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:10,180
Fingers crossed the version of Castlevania comes with it.

1230
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:11,700
Orange-

1231
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:17,060
Just from the tweet, it says, details will be announced on 10.8 and reservations will

1232
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:17,940
start on the same day.

1233
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:22,660
Oh, okay. So that's just the... That's an announcement of an announcement. All right.

1234
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:27,780
Orange Right says, I saw this on Retro Pals, had a lot of great Capcom arcade ports,

1235
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:28,580
among other things.

1236
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:34,900
DJ Rama S says, River City Ransom was on it too. Yeah, so what a fitting tribute.

1237
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:35,400
Yeah.

1238
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:39,540
The Nikketsu Downtown fight.

1239
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:44,020
Yeah, the original name, of course. All right, let's move on. And now we can do some world

1240
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:47,140
release dates. And now we'll start with the US Loki.

1241
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:53,540
Yeah, so very exciting week. We're starting off with Return to Monkey Island on PC and

1242
01:54:53,540 --> 01:55:00,900
Nintendo Switch. I will definitely be picking that up. There is no light on PC.

1243
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:01,860
There are four lights.

1244
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:03,640
Nevermind.

1245
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:05,400
Stop it with your Star Trek references.

1246
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:05,900
I got it.

1247
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:08,760
Amnesia Memories-

1248
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:09,320
Thank you, I love nerds.

1249
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:14,520
And Amnesia Later Cross Crowd on Nintendo Switch.

1250
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:21,960
Construction Simulator on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1251
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:27,640
Hard Space Shipbreaker on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

1252
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:34,520
Uh, Jack Move on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1253
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:41,080

1264
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,800
I think that's actually the same game.

1265
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:31,720

1273
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:20,040

We've got Volus, The Phantasm Soldier Collection 2 on Nintendo Switch.

1280
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:55,960
All right, well, heading over to Japan, some similar stuff to what Loki had just mentioned

1281
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:59,720
there, because in Japan, Taeko no Tatsujin Rhythm Festival is coming out on the Switch,

1282
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:02,680
much to a Mike Deff's delight, although I don't know if he imports those things.

1283
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:05,720
The Dial Field Chronicle is out.

1284
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:10,680
It's an English release, but it is available on the Switch in Japan, a local release.

1285
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:14,840
Valise, The Phantasm Soldier Collection 2, also out on the Switch.

1286
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:22,200
Loki already mentioned it, but that Jayuzenge and Getsusangokuden 1 and 2 is out in a regular

1287
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:25,400
and limited edition on the Switch this week in Japan.

1288
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:27,080
No Place for Bravery.

1289
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:32,200
It's not translated, but it is still being released in Japan this week as well as Potion

1290
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:36,840
Permit and Valise, The Phantasm Soldier Collection 2.

1291
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:37,720
Why is this listed twice?

1292
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:39,240
Oh, because there's a regular limited edition.

1293
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:40,200
That was the limited edition.

1294
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:40,600
My bad.

1295
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:42,920
Let's see.

1296
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:48,920
Going over to the PlayStation 5, and we have the Dial Field Chronicle is out there on the

1297
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:55,480
PlayStation 5 as well, and Necromunda Hired Gun, again, it's in English, but it is getting

1298
01:58:55,480 --> 01:59:00,760
an official release in Japan on the 22nd of September, along with Potion Permit also

1299
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:02,200
on the PlayStation 5.

1300
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,040
So there you go.

1301
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:05,480
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1302
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:08,120
So, of course, a handful.

1303
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:14,680
On the 20th, we have Stray for PlayStation, Thuls Deluxe Edition.

1304
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:21,160
They misspelled edition, I think, for PlayStation and Xbox.

1305
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:24,280
And for the same, we also have Construction Simulator.

1306
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:30,200
On the 22nd, for the three consoles, we have the Dial Field Chronicle, PlayStation and

1307
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:32,280
Xbox, we have Sessions Skate Sim.

1308
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:40,600
For the three, Potion Permit, which is actually, I was, it's on Steam right now.

1309
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:47,400
On the 23rd, we have Tea Time Golf on Switch.

1310
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:51,800
And then for the three, we have Dragons Legends of the Nine Realms.

1311
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:54,300
All right.

1312
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:59,800
We just have a few more stories for you, and then we'll open up the listener roundtable

1313
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:04,920
via our mailbag, which is participate at orangeontrader.com, as well as our Twitter

1314
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:08,200
at O-L-R, and even some phone calls.

1315
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:11,800
You can join our Discord server and continue the conversation throughout the week over,

1316
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:16,040
excuse me, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1317
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:29,640
That's what I get for drinking coke during the show.

1318
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:33,320
All right, let's move on with a few more stories.

1319
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:33,820
Loki.

1320
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:42,600
Yes, so I hate to tell you this, all you Babylon's Fall fans out there, but they're

1321
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:43,800
shutting the game down.

1322
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:47,080
So the servers are gonna be shut off February 2023.

1323
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:50,680
Apparently, the game was not all that popular.

1324
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:59,480
And it says, today we've revealed new information about version 1.0 and the future of Babylon

1325
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:00,840
development.

1326
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:08,440
After the service ends Monday, February 27th, 2023, 11pm Pacific time, you'll no longer

1327
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,320
be able to play the game.

1328
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:14,680
All gameplay data on the game servers will be deleted following the termination of the

1329
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:15,400
service.

1330
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:17,000
It was a $60 game.

1331
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,200
It lasted less than a year.

1332
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:21,960
Live services, the future of gaming.

1333
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:23,240
But up, up, up, up, up.

1334
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:29,240
I was gonna say, what went wrong with Babylon's Fall?

1335
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:30,600
But honestly, I never played it.

1336
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:31,640
I couldn't tell you.

1337
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:33,960
I think I've never heard of it.

1338
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:38,760
I think this was the game that recycled some of the Final Fantasy 14 assets.

1339
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:39,240
It sure did.

1340
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:42,760
But I don't think that's that big of a deal.

1341
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:48,840
Like, it just sounds like the game was a very obvious sort of games as a service kind of

1342
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,240
thing.

1343
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:51,400
And I think, I don't know.

1344
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:54,760
I think gamers have just had their fill of a lot of these, and it's probably hard to

1345
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:57,240
shove an original IP out there with this at this point.

1346
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:58,440
But we'll see.

1347
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:01,640
All right, moving on.

1348
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:02,360
Dark Sakura.

1349
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:09,880
So there already is a little bit of controversy around the multiverses game.

1350
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:17,640
Velma, her power is being changed in the game because she has the ability to call the police.

1351
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:25,800
And since there are black characters in the game, it has definitely, especially in light

1352
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:32,600
of, you know, past white women calling the police for people, you know, doing a barbecue

1353
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:34,120
in a public park, for example.

1354
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:38,920
You know, birds, watering flowers.

1355
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:44,040
She has been referred to as a Karen in the game.

1356
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:52,520
And so the response is that they're going to change her power from being like a big

1357
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:59,160
snitch and Karen to, you know, actually doing something different.

1358
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:03,560
And they say that her abilities changed Thursday.

1359
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:08,200
Instead of calling the police, Velma now solves the mystery and calls the mystery ink gang

1360
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:11,080
and mystery machine to take the bad guys away.

1361
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:14,440
They just replaced the cop car with the mystery machine car.

1362
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:17,960
But it still reads a lot better than it did before.

1363
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:26,200
Well, to keep going back out, Warner Brothers Interactive said that it was welcomed by some

1364
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:31,320
players that, you know, and in fact, one person on Twitter, I'm going to read the quote because

1365
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:36,040
it's apt, Velma got updated to multiverses and now she doesn't call the cops, which good

1366
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:38,280
they shouldn't have gotten there to begin with.

1367
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:40,840
She calls the mystery machine now, which just makes more sense.

1368
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:47,560
Um, and people are saying that they like how responsive the developers are being, but not

1369
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:48,760
everyone really likes it.

1370
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:53,880
Another person says, I'm sick of the whole Velma is a Karen narrative that has come out

1371
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:54,680
of multiverses.

1372
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:58,920
Velma actually does her research and collects evidence before calling the cops on her opponents.

1373
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:00,200
She's clearly not a Karen.

1374
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:08,440
Honestly, though, they're missing the point that she is calling the police on, you know,

1375
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:09,800
black characters in the game.

1376
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:15,080
I mean, it's every character in the game, but it's specific that she, you know, that

1377
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:22,360
there is a definite societal connotation there that isn't the type of message we should be

1378
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:23,160
sending out there.

1379
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:30,120
There's this thing called optics and reading the room and the room was red and yeah.

1380
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:34,840
And that doesn't, they don't, it just shouldn't have been there.

1381
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:35,240
Yeah.

1382
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:39,960
It's the, the only, the only criticism I have about this, I just have one minor, I don't,

1383
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:43,800
I don't care that they, well, actually I think it's good that they replaced the, uh, uh,

1384
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:45,320
cop car with the mystery machine.

1385
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:49,400
My one complaint is that when the mystery machine opens up to put the play or the other

1386
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:52,120
player in there, a cloud of smoke should be coming out of the car.

1387
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:55,880
That's my only complaint, uh, is that they miss that opportunity with the mystery machine.

1388
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:57,080
It is a level of realism.

1389
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:59,720
That's just the person in there and hot box them.

1390
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:02,440
They don't care about doing it anymore.

1391
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:03,080
Exactly.

1392
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:05,320
That's my complaint.

1393
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:06,440
Otherwise, yeah.

1394
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:07,640
All right.

1395
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:09,160
Let's move on.

1396
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:12,040
Just a few more stories for you and then we'll get to the listener round table.

1397
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:12,540
Loki.

1398
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:14,140
All right.

1399
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:20,840
I mean, I am really not surprised when it comes to this company, but Ubisoft is going

1400
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:29,560
to be adapting or adopting a $70 price tag model for their major releases because they

1401
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:37,880
feel that these games on PlayStation four as well from PlayStation five and Xbox series X.

1402
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:41,960
So I don't think it mentioned anything about PlayStation four.

1403
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:45,480
I don't even know if these games are coming out on PlayStation four.

1404
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:53,480
Um, but yeah, not excited about it, especially when you have these companies that put out

1405
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:58,120
games, you know, that this price point and the games are still unpolished.

1406
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:00,440
You know, I'm, I don't know.

1407
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:02,440
I don't think it's worth it, but you know what?

1408
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:05,880
You have to look at your wallet and see if it's worth it.

1409
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:08,440
Here's a great new technique when it comes to these games.

1410
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:15,000
You just wait two years and then they go on Xbox game pass and then you don't pay anything.

1411
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:17,400
Well, I mean, you're paying your game pass.

1412
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:22,760
I don't pay anything more, but honestly, if you know how to work that Microsoft rewards

1413
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:27,400
program, which I I've kind of fallen off the map from doing, I was a lot better at it before.

1414
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:32,600
I was, I was getting a lot of my months of game pass comped by just like, you know,

1415
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:35,320
doing all the surveys and all that crap.

1416
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:40,760
So I honestly, you probably could work the system and get it for free if you actually

1417
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:42,520
are willing to do that.

1418
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,520
Um, I would say with minimal effort, you could probably get every third month comped, uh,

1419
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:51,720
with fairly minimal effort, as long as you check in that app once in a while.

1420
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:56,840
But yeah, there was this additional money going to, uh, fund the people that will be

1421
02:06:56,840 --> 02:07:02,680
looking into ease, come on for all the, uh, propagating of bad culture at the company

1422
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:03,960
and all the sexual harassment.

1423
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:05,240
Is any of that money going to that?

1424
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:11,880
Uh, sadly, I don't think it is, uh, but that's a very fair call out that you, uh, bring up

1425
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:12,440
there.

1426
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:17,240
So, I mean, I feel that, you know, a company with those kinds of quality standards, uh,

1427
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:20,200
within the company certainly is worth an extra $10.

1428
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:23,560
I mean, clearly they've, they've addressed all the issues.

1429
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:23,800
Yes.

1430
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:26,520
I'll pay an extra $10 for your game when you fire ease, come on.

1431
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:30,760
That's, that's the $10 decision that needs to be made.

1432
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:31,080
Yes.

1433
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:36,040
I realize shareholders and that's probably not really going to happen.

1434
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:36,680
It needs to.

1435
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:37,800
All right.

1436
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:41,720
Anyway, meantime, I'll tell you what you can spend your money on.

1437
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:48,440
If you want to do a value in gaming, I'll tell you what.

1438
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:53,560
Whoever has the rights to Garfield boy.

1439
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:54,200
Oh boy.

1440
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:59,240
The people that come up with these Garfield games, they could not come up with an original

1441
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:02,120
idea to, to, to save their life.

1442
02:08:02,120 --> 02:08:07,400
Let me tell you, if somebody had a gun to their head and said, Hey, Garfield people,

1443
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:09,480
you need to come up with original idea.

1444
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:10,280
Well, guess what?

1445
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:16,280
This week it was announced Garfield lasagna party is coming out bang because it's just

1446
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:19,400
a rip off of Mario party basically.

1447
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:20,600
And that's what's coming out.

1448
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:25,800
But it's coming out on PlayStation five, all the Xbox consoles, of course, PS four,

1449
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:27,800
Xbox one, switch and PC.

1450
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:30,120
It's launching in November.

1451
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:30,680
That's right.

1452
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:36,040
You can play party games with Garfield, Odie, Arlene, Nirmal.

1453
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:39,000
I don't know if the rest of the U S acres characters are there.

1454
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:44,920
I wonder if, if Greg is doing any of the voices, if they bring in like the U S acres characters.

1455
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:46,680
Yeah, no idea.

1456
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:48,600
And I don't, I only see those four.

1457
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:52,840
They just say, play us one of the four iconic characters from Jim Davis's iconic comics.

1458
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:56,600
So they don't say anything about the, um, the other characters.

1459
02:08:56,600 --> 02:09:03,800
So we'll see, uh, maybe there'll be DLC, uh, uh, dynamic party game filled with crazy

1460
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:05,240
and tasty mini games.

1461
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:09,400
You can tell this is just a copy paste and press release, uh, pizza square, slicing

1462
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:13,720
challenge, snowballs, throwing competition, obstacle race, and more.

1463
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:25,400
I'm sure this game is going to be unique and never before seen and just groundbreaking.

1464
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:27,640
Anyway, there you go.

1465
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:29,000
Lasagna party.

1466
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:33,160
Uh, I agree with Zen monkey and chat who says we need Heathcliff games.

1467
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:33,560
Yes.

1468
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:34,120
Yes, we do.

1469
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:40,840
Heathcliff in the, uh, that Nintendo all star brawl thing, or is it just Garfield?

1470
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:43,720
Nintendo all star brawl.

1471
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:45,160
Yeah.

1472
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:47,720
I thought they had like a Nintendo one with all the Nicktoons stuff.

1473
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:50,440
Oh, then it's the Nickelodeon.

1474
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:50,760
Also.

1475
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:52,120
No, I think just Garfield's in that.

1476
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:52,440
I'm sorry.

1477
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:55,720
I was thinking Nickelodeon brothers.

1478
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:56,120
What?

1479
02:09:56,120 --> 02:09:57,240
No, no, no.

1480
02:09:57,240 --> 02:10:02,600
I was thinking Nickelodeon for some reason said Nintendo, but, um, yeah.

1481
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:06,920
In the Nickelodeon game, that's where they should throw it on.

1482
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:09,400
They could have a throw it on between Garfield and Heathcliff.

1483
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:12,120
Uh, tiger class says we need eek the cat.

1484
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:13,480
I could sign up for that.

1485
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:14,040
Oh my God.

1486
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:14,760
Eek the cat.

1487
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:19,080
I just, I want some more like old school Nickelodeon fucking base.

1488
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:22,600
And I'm talking, they need to go even deeper for us forties.

1489
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:24,440
They need to go even deeper on set.

1490
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:30,760
Like we need some, we need, we need more Canadian television that they repackaged on

1491
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:32,360
Nickelodeon for the America.

1492
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:34,200
I'm talking today special.

1493
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,760
I'm talking pinwheel special.

1494
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:38,360
You can't do that on television.

1495
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:40,040
Let's get some Mr.

1496
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:41,000
Wizard up in there.

1497
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:47,320
I want, I want moose as a playable character in the Nickelodeon game and, and, uh, Lisa

1498
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:48,120
ruddy.

1499
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:55,160
I want, um, fucking Eureka's castle, Turkey television, duckula, duckula.

1500
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:59,160
I want it all 1990s tomorrow.

1501
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:01,240
People got a danger mouse.

1502
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:03,800
Christ, y'all are on a roll.

1503
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:07,720
That's, that's the Nickelodeon all stars game we deserve.

1504
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:11,560
Like, is there a code I can put in on the menu to unlock danger mouse?

1505
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:12,520
Is that a thing I can do?

1506
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:14,840
Welcome freshman.

1507
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:15,560
Oh my God.

1508
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:18,600
Like your, your talent should be penfold.

1509
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:23,880
What did they, there was this Canadian soap opera and Ryan Reynolds, I think was on it.

1510
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:27,160
That's how, I think they called it 15 here.

1511
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:28,600
Oh yeah.

1512
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:34,520
But it was just, again, all those Nickelodeon shows were like repackaged Canadian shows.

1513
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:39,480
Like, but then they like stuff like, like you can't do that on television.

1514
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:42,280
Those people were more popular here than they were in Canada.

1515
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:45,000
This is funny how that stuff works out.

1516
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,600
So anyway, all right.

1517
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:51,960
Zen monkey 11 and chat says, yeah, it was called 15.

1518
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:53,400
I hated that show.

1519
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:56,520
What did they call then MTV?

1520
02:11:56,520 --> 02:12:00,760
It wasn't a Canadian show at this point, but MTV did a dramatic soap, undressed.

1521
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:03,160
That was, did you have all ever watched undressed?

1522
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:05,880
That show is scandalous.

1523
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:07,080
That show is scandalous.

1524
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:08,040
Yeah.

1525
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:08,440
Anyway.

1526
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:09,720
All right.

1527
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:11,000
Moving on.

1528
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,520
Let's get to the listener round table.

1529
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:15,880
Do we have any emails this week?

1530
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:19,000
Participate at orangesontrader.com is the place to send emails.

1531
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:20,840
Nary a one.

1532
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:21,240
All right.

1533
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:22,120
Ooh.

1534
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:26,360
That does mean we get to divulge into drag race content, but I don't, I there's, I'm

1535
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:27,720
not watching anything now.

1536
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:30,440
They revealed everybody on celebrity drag race.

1537
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:31,800
Oh, did they?

1538
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:32,860
Yeah.

1539
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:37,000
And it's everyone I thought thought it was going to be.

1540
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,520
Well, the, the guy from mean girls was so obvious.

1541
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:41,800
Like that had to be him.

1542
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:42,200
Right.

1543
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:44,120
Like you could tell that was him.

1544
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:45,240
Mark and Delicato.

1545
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:49,000
Um, ugly Betty.

1546
02:12:50,280 --> 02:12:54,840
There was, oh, he was like a little kid then, but that was like 10 years ago.

1547
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:55,960
He's probably in his twenties now.

1548
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:57,080
Yeah.

1549
02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:57,480
Yeah.

1550
02:12:57,480 --> 02:13:00,120
There were, um, Oh God.

1551
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:06,040
Um, Oh, uh, Tatiana, uh, Ali.

1552
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:08,760
Oh, okay.

1553
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:10,120
As in Ashley banks.

1554
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:10,360
Yeah.

1555
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:10,680
Yeah.

1556
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:19,640
Um, some, some comments from chat because now everybody's talking about the, the reminiscing

1557
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:23,560
see a Tiberian chat says undressed on before love line.

1558
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:25,880
Have I had to have told this on OLR at some point, right?

1559
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:29,240
I was, I was on love line, not the TV show, but the radio shows.

1560
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:31,720
Y'all know it was a radio show way before then.

1561
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:33,720
And it was, I was on it once.

1562
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:37,240
And, but I called because I wanted to talk to the celebrity guests.

1563
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:38,040
I did not know.

1564
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:40,920
It's not one of those things where, Ooh, tell us what your question was, Rob.

1565
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:43,240
No, cause it wasn't, it wasn't anything juicy like that.

1566
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:51,480
I wanted to talk to, um, Kennedy, the MTV VJ was on the show and I called in to ask

1567
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:55,880
her a question because that was in my era of that's the type of work I want to do.

1568
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:57,400
Look how far I made it.

1569
02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:02,120
Um, and, uh, uh, I wanted to, I don't remember exactly what the question was.

1570
02:14:02,120 --> 02:14:04,600
Something about like her success and all that stuff.

1571
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:07,240
Um, and uh, yeah, I got to talk to her.

1572
02:14:07,240 --> 02:14:09,240
So that was, that was fun.

1573
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:09,740
Yeah.

1574
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:11,100
So, yeah.

1575
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:12,840
Uh, we, we love it.

1576
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:14,060
Yeah.

1577
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:18,840
Uh, as Joan Hunter Matt reminds us Elvira's birthday was yesterday.

1578
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:19,720
Yeah.

1579
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:21,640
She's, uh, 71 now I think.

1580
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:22,140
Right?

1581
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:24,600
Oh, Cassandra's going strong.

1582
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:25,100
Yep.

1583
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:25,600
Yep.

1584
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:31,040
The, the, uh, uh, I'm sorry, but the, the first big drag queen on television before

1585
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:33,200
RuPaul was Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.

1586
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:41,600
Do not forget the, the, the, probably the best and biggest drag queen of all time is

1587
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:43,360
Cassandra Peterson, Elvira.

1588
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:43,860
Indeed.

1589
02:14:44,640 --> 02:14:45,140
All right.

1590
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:47,760
You know, when, when even Ru says it.

1591
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:50,160
Yeah, Elvira is a drag queen, period.

1592
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:55,040
Like that's just, it's just that, that wasn't the word for it yet, but Elvira is absolutely

1593
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:55,600
a drag queen.

1594
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:56,900
All right.

1595
02:14:57,600 --> 02:14:59,040
Um, let's see what else?

1596
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:00,560
Oh, we have somebody in the green room.

1597
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:02,560
Why don't we get to some calls?

1598
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:06,560
So if you want to join the green room, just go to vognetwork.com slash discord.

1599
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:10,160
And you too can be on Orange Launch Radio, just like this caller here.

1600
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:11,360
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1601
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:11,860
Who's this?

1602
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:14,160
It is the one and only Ron.

1603
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:15,440
How is everybody doing tonight?

1604
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:17,280
Hey, I am fantastic, Ron.

1605
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:18,160
How about yourself?

1606
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:22,240
Except I lost a Loki somehow, but I'll, I'll find him here while you talk to us here.

1607
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:23,920
Use the Konami code.

1608
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:24,480
He'll come back.

1609
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:26,160
Apparently or something.

1610
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:28,720
So I don't know what I'm hiding behind dark sacros.

1611
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:29,040
Fine.

1612
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:29,920
I probably know.

1613
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:31,200
I just moved the scene around.

1614
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:34,160
I'll fix it live on air as I always do, but let's talk.

1615
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:36,560
I've done the same thing when we go live.

1616
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:38,160
I'm like, Oh, I forgot to change the episode.

1617
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:40,000
The title episode changed that real quick.

1618
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:41,600
Yeah, I don't.

1619
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:44,480
I literally like deleted Loki somehow.

1620
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:44,720
All right.

1621
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:45,280
That's all right.

1622
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:48,880
So we'll just, we'll duplicate one of the other ones and get them back.

1623
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:51,440
Well, what's on your mind while I fix it live here?

1624
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:52,240
Rama, how are you?

1625
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:53,600
I'm good.

1626
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:54,400
I'm tired.

1627
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:55,680
I just unpacked from a trip.

1628
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:58,160
Now I've got to pack for a trip for this weekend.

1629
02:15:58,160 --> 02:15:59,120
So, you know, but.

1630
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:01,280
Enough about that.

1631
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:02,080
A couple of things.

1632
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:05,920
I'll be on my merry little way that I can just enjoy the rest of the show dinner and

1633
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:06,880
watch anime.

1634
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:08,800
Now I just find it funny.

1635
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:18,960
Well, yeah, I try to make something interesting as best I possibly can, but this whole Ubisoft

1636
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:20,320
thing, $10 more.

1637
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:26,240
I'm just saying if you want to save the $10, just get the Xbox version because remember

1638
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:29,360
the Xbox version is the same green case.

1639
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:33,680
And when you buy and you pull it out, it says Xbox one Xbox series on it.

1640
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:34,880
So there you go.

1641
02:16:36,640 --> 02:16:37,360
No good point.

1642
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:40,080
And I still say my advice from before also stands.

1643
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:43,760
Just wait for them to give it away because they all inevitably get given away or put

1644
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:48,320
on those like game pass, uh, PlayStation plus like those types of things because there's

1645
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:50,080
money to be made still there.

1646
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:52,000
You know, that is true.

1647
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:56,880
I mean, I picked up cryptid and necro dancer for switch for like four bucks, like over

1648
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:57,520
the weekend.

1649
02:16:57,520 --> 02:17:03,840
So if you're willing, yeah, if you're willing to wait two years to play a game and I get

1650
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:03,920
it.

1651
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:07,920
Sometimes we're not, sometimes we're not like final fantasy 16.

1652
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:08,800
No, bitch.

1653
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:10,960
Day one, day fucking one.

1654
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:12,400
I totally get that.

1655
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:15,520
There are some games I will day one purchase the others.

1656
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:20,240
I'll just put in my honey list and I'll just wait till it tells me, Oh, it's on sale for

1657
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:21,520
such and such price.

1658
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:23,840
And which I did during the pandemic.

1659
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:31,200
And I realized I have probably over $500 worth of physical games I purchased during the pandemic

1660
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:32,560
that is still sealed.

1661
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:34,400
That should be the pandemic.

1662
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:34,640
Yep.

1663
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:35,440
The pandemic.

1664
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:36,240
The pandemic.

1665
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:37,360
I like that.

1666
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:39,520
I'm going to use that for now on the pandemic.

1667
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:42,240
My friends, Patty and Steph coined at the pandemic.

1668
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:43,600
Same Patty.

1669
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:44,640
I know from a jazz.

1670
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:46,080
No, a different Patty.

1671
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:47,040
She's okay.

1672
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:47,200
Yeah.

1673
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:49,120
I have to introduce y'all one day.

1674
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:50,000
You will love her.

1675
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,760
I, you know what?

1676
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:57,040
Miss, Miss Melody and I have been talking and we did text Victoria as well about a return

1677
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:58,800
to New York type of trip.

1678
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:03,520
But what we realized, Rama, the only thing that we kind of are interested in seeing on

1679
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:06,880
Broadway right now is Funny Girl with Lea Michele.

1680
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:11,520
And it's, it's literally one of those, like, we're morbidly curious.

1681
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:13,040
And that's the only way to describe it.

1682
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:16,320
Like, we have to be in the room.

1683
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:20,000
We have to be in the room for a second.

1684
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,600
I thought she was going to say Phantom of the Opera.

1685
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:23,120
I was gonna go, not you too.

1686
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:25,040
No, that news hadn't come out yet.

1687
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:31,120
I feel like Phantom of the Opera plays in like every fucking town in America at some

1688
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:31,360
point.

1689
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:34,320
And it's the same damn thing from a same thing with the Lion King.

1690
02:18:34,320 --> 02:18:36,080
How's the Lion King still on Broadway?

1691
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:39,120
That show comes to every town in America.

1692
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:45,200
You can go to Walla Walla, Washington and see a performance of the Lion King, just like

1693
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:46,080
it is on Broadway.

1694
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:48,080
Maybe not the same stars, but you know what?

1695
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:49,360
It's acted just fine.

1696
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:52,160
I want to take you all to see Beetlejuice.

1697
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:53,520
That was amazing.

1698
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:54,480
Oh, that would have been fun.

1699
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:56,320
No, it's still playing.

1700
02:18:56,320 --> 02:18:56,880
Oh, is it?

1701
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:58,640
It came back.

1702
02:18:58,640 --> 02:18:59,760
It came back.

1703
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:00,400
Oh, nice.

1704
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:00,720
Nice.

1705
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:03,440
Pod Culture says don't knock on Phantom.

1706
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:04,000
I'm not.

1707
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:07,600
I'm just saying it's the same fucking show that tours America all the time.

1708
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:08,800
And it's just as good.

1709
02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:12,080
You're not going to see Sarah Brightman in that show ever again.

1710
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:13,600
So you know what?

1711
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:16,720
Let the other actresses have their moment.

1712
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:18,720
I don't like Sarah Brightman, so I don't care.

1713
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:18,960
Oh, no.

1714
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:19,760
What did she do?

1715
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:20,160
Did she?

1716
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:22,800
No, it's just her voice is too brassy.

1717
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:23,920
Oh, I love her.

1718
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:26,560
I do not like her voice in Phantom.

1719
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:28,000
Legit.

1720
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:28,800
Disagree on that.

1721
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:33,360
Well, honestly, honestly, it was Repo, the genetic opera that sold me on her.

1722
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:35,360
I love her in that movie.

1723
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:36,720
That's the only thing she's been in that I like her in.

1724
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:40,000
Okay, on that we agree that she's good in that.

1725
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:41,920
I still like her in other stuff.

1726
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:46,400
Anyway, look, here's the thing.

1727
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:46,960
Here's the thing.

1728
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:49,760
I'm going to just say this very plainly and very openly.

1729
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:56,400
Sometimes there is music that you want to listen to when you just feel like a gigantic

1730
02:19:57,520 --> 02:19:58,560
homosexual slur.

1731
02:19:58,560 --> 02:20:00,400
Okay, I'm not going to say it, but you know the word.

1732
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:04,320
When you're just in that mood where I feel like a gigantic tonight.

1733
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:08,080
Sarah Brightman is one of those CDs that you will put on.

1734
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:14,160
You will put on and it's just like, I'm just, I am feeling my gay oats tonight.

1735
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:20,080
Listening to some Sarah Brightman deliver me out of the sadness.

1736
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:21,360
It's that 100%.

1737
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:24,000
Rob, are you having a moment right now?

1738
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,160
Because I can always I might be.

1739
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:28,400
I might be putting on some Sarah Brightman after the show tonight.

1740
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:28,880
I might.

1741
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:30,400
You know what?

1742
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:30,960
You know what?

1743
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:36,080
Before I get to the second topic, I just love how when I call in, we don't derail.

1744
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:41,680
We just jump the fucking rail, end up on a track like halfway across town.

1745
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:50,000
When you call in, the train's driver three mode is activated and anything can happen, Rama.

1746
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:55,840
Now, the other thing we're talking about is G4.

1747
02:20:56,400 --> 02:21:02,560
And as I said in the chat, the fact that anything G4 related is not on Peacock.

1748
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:04,800
That's the first thing you should know.

1749
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:11,120
There was no faith in this because any of the Comcast network is on Peacock.

1750
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:13,760
That was my earliest prediction about that whole thing.

1751
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:16,720
When they first announced G4, I was like, oh, they're putting it on Peacock.

1752
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:17,280
That's the whole thing.

1753
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:19,440
And it wasn't that you're right.

1754
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:21,120
Why isn't it on Peacock?

1755
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:24,560
No, no, but WWE is on Peacock, but G4 isn't.

1756
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:25,920
Interesting.

1757
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:32,080
I just, you know, because that again, we talk about cable going away and it's going to go

1758
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:32,640
away.

1759
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:35,600
It's going to be things like Peacock and, you know, all these other.

1760
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:37,840
Unfortunately, it's the battle of the streaming networks.

1761
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:40,960
But you are starting to see consolidation.

1762
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:45,200
You know, you're starting to see that they're realizing, you know, for better and for worse.

1763
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:47,360
So when I say for worse, I mean, discovery.

1764
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:49,120
We all know we all know.

1765
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:49,600
Let's not.

1766
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:50,800
Oh, let's not.

1767
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:52,880
Because I have a napalm with their name on it.

1768
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:53,520
Oh, let's not.

1769
02:21:54,320 --> 02:21:57,120
Careful when you say things like that on a live Internet show.

1770
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:58,400
He's speaking in a hyperbole.

1771
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:05,040
Anyway, but the other thing now, now the train really did derail.

1772
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:06,480
Oh, Showtime.

1773
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:07,760
That was the big one.

1774
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:12,640
So they're realizing people don't want to pay like, what is it, like 10 bucks a month

1775
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:14,000
just for Showtime stuff?

1776
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,360
Yeah, $10 extra.

1777
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:15,520
Yeah.

1778
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:17,760
And so they're going to merge.

1779
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:21,680
They're going to merge Showtime into, I think, Paramount Plus at this point, which it's all

1780
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:26,400
good because there's a bundle deal going on.

1781
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:28,960
If you pay for it, you go into the app, you push up.

1782
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:32,080
It brings up the Showtime stuff, Hulu and Prime.

1783
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:37,440
I did buy Showtime at one point for one specific show.

1784
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:39,760
And then I immediately canceled it when said show is over.

1785
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:40,640
And that was Twin Peaks.

1786
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:43,360
The return I did it for Dexter.

1787
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:45,680
And I'm just severely disappointed how it ended.

1788
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:47,760
So I'm like, I don't care if there's a season two.

1789
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:49,040
I'm not resubbing for it.

1790
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:53,520
Yeah, but I'll resub for a season four of Twin Peaks if it ever happens.

1791
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:57,760
But I don't expect David Lynch to actually do it, but I hope fair.

1792
02:22:58,400 --> 02:23:00,720
Now, here's the thing about G4.

1793
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:07,200
I have no desire because there's nothing on there that caters interest me.

1794
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:13,040
I enjoy watching more tech YouTubers and tech Twitch streams and so forth.

1795
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:14,800
That's more interesting to me.

1796
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:22,480
What G4, I mean, we're at the point where gaming is console and PC.

1797
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:26,560
I understand that G4 has some known streamers on there.

1798
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:29,280
But honestly, it ain't doing a lick of good.

1799
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:33,920
They're too busy fighting back against the woke, which I'm all for.

1800
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:37,840
Because there are people out there who are running their mouth that need not to.

1801
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:42,480
OK, but what G4 needs to do is cater everybody.

1802
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:47,280
Have a show about technology, about building and repairs.

1803
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:52,480
I've always said for the longest I wanted a Geek Squad-esque reality show on there where

1804
02:23:52,480 --> 02:23:56,720
it shows them working on these computers and talking about how people can't do certain

1805
02:23:56,720 --> 02:23:57,040
stuff.

1806
02:23:57,040 --> 02:24:04,320
Yeah, that's my cup of tea.

1807
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:07,040
You know, I'm just getting my depth and chat says, wait, wait, wait.

1808
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:08,080
Fight against the woke.

1809
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:10,880
Can you know what I mean against them?

1810
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:11,920
But, you know.

1811
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:12,880
Oh, OK.

1812
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:17,040
So like earlier what you were saying earlier that I got it, got it, got it, got it.

1813
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:19,920
That's what I meant.

1814
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:22,720
You know, it sounded backwards the way it came out with.

1815
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:23,440
I get I get you now.

1816
02:24:23,440 --> 02:24:23,920
I get you now.

1817
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:27,680
Yeah, normally I kind of have like a little notepad here of everything.

1818
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:28,320
I want to find.

1819
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:29,680
I'm glad I asked.

1820
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:34,800
Fifth Dream says, yeah, G4 is OK, but it's nothing I can't get from any other random

1821
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:35,520
Twitch streamer.

1822
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:40,080
Tiger class says G4 TV needs somebody like a Linus with all the tech stuff.

1823
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:43,520
It it needs a sort of must see TV.

1824
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:47,840
And I feel like right now it's kind of living in a nostalgia realm with things like X play

1825
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:48,720
and so forth, which is fine.

1826
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:50,240
And clearly there's an audience for that.

1827
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:52,400
We have people in our chat that are still watching.

1828
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:52,880
And that's good.

1829
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:55,040
Again, I'm not I'm not here to yuck your yum.

1830
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:56,080
You know, that's great.

1831
02:24:56,080 --> 02:25:02,560
I'm just saying the landscape is a lot different now than it was in 2006 when that was the

1832
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:08,000
only way to see tech content in the media was either tech TV or, you know, when the merger

1833
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,760
first happened or early G4, whatever, whatever side of the fence you're on.

1834
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:13,920
That was the only way to see it back in the day.

1835
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:15,440
That's just not the case anymore.

1836
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:18,320
It has to compete with literally everything else.

1837
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:20,000
So it needs more moments.

1838
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:28,320
And I'm just I'm not sure I'm not sure how resting on the successes of the past are going

1839
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,080
to make it new fans.

1840
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:33,360
I see how it enthuses the old fans.

1841
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:35,840
I don't see how it adds new fans.

1842
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:39,600
But I you know, again, I'm not trying to run a TV network.

1843
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:41,680
It's a lot more complicated than I think.

1844
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:47,440
So, you know, you know what I've done G4 good if they actually did live streams of Evo or

1845
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:49,120
highlights of that, if they had something like that.

1846
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:54,000
Actually, I don't know if you remember a couple of years back coverage what they used to do.

1847
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1848
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:56,720
I believe it was a couple of years back.

1849
02:25:56,720 --> 02:26:00,080
Disney was showing a gaming tournament on their channel.

1850
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:01,280
I was like, wait, what?

1851
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:01,680
Yeah.

1852
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:01,920
You know?

1853
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:04,960
No, that I think you make a good point.

1854
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:10,080
And to be fair and out of interest, the pandemic and all that is probably lowered the opportunities

1855
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:11,920
for G4 to really push into that space.

1856
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:16,560
But I think you bring up an excellent point is that, you know, people always will flock

1857
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:20,880
back to TV and live TV and local TV and that stuff for live events.

1858
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:24,240
And I think the more of that the G4 can kind of bring in, I think I think you're right

1859
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:25,600
that that would be very interesting.

1860
02:26:26,240 --> 02:26:32,480
So Zen Monkey is pointing out one of the ex hosts did a I'm sorry ex host did a full live

1861
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:33,840
stream of a cosplay event.

1862
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:37,600
So they probably just, you know, need to lean into that a little more.

1863
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:43,840
Yeah, because gaming is, it's basically all encompassing gaming, tech, cosplay, anime,

1864
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:44,320
all of that.

1865
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:50,480
I mean, you could you could have shows about not just gaming, but have some shows about

1866
02:26:50,480 --> 02:26:55,120
tech, what's going on, have some shows, like, maybe throw some anime on there stream that

1867
02:26:55,120 --> 02:27:00,320
because remember, tech TV was showing late night anime and that did help, you know, it's

1868
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:05,200
a little bit of everything that could work, you know, because, because let's be real,

1869
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:10,400
I don't want to turn on G4 and watch another episode of Star Trek Next Generation.

1870
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:12,000
Not to have nothing against it.

1871
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,640
But to me personally, it ain't the show to what I expect to find on it.

1872
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:21,360
Now, if they took the video game Star Trek The Next Generation, I was doing parody episodes

1873
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:22,720
with it with the graphics.

1874
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:27,840
Yeah, wasn't that literally there was a show like that on the old old G4.

1875
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:28,960
It was MMOs.

1876
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:30,800
They did lines.

1877
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:31,920
They dubbed over MMOs.

1878
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:37,280
That was like one of the earliest shows on the original G4 before tech TV portal.

1879
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:38,080
This is what that was.

1880
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:39,920
It was called Portal before there was a game called that.

1881
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:43,280
Bring back code monkeys, you know, come on now.

1882
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:46,640
There is so much stuff going on in the gaming industry.

1883
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:48,080
They could easily parody.

1884
02:27:48,080 --> 02:27:50,720
That's like five seasons of content right there.

1885
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:52,720
All right.

1886
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:55,120
Well, my friend, do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1887
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:57,120
Oh, no, that's it.

1888
02:27:57,120 --> 02:27:59,680
Besides the fact I like Jamie's new hairstyle.

1889
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:01,600
It's kind of banging rocket.

1890
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:04,640
I actually was trying to fix the shave myself.

1891
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:06,480
So hold on.

1892
02:28:06,480 --> 02:28:08,160
Let me show you what I ended up doing.

1893
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:13,280
I'm going to actually be going to sport clips like, you know, the place where the dudes

1894
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:14,000
get their hair done.

1895
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:18,800
This is what I did as far as I can do by myself.

1896
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:21,760
I think you did a really good job.

1897
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:24,000
It's a lot better than what I did during the pandemic.

1898
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:26,320
Screw this and just shave my head bald.

1899
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:27,840
OK, I came close to that, though.

1900
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:33,120
But I am after Twitch Con.

1901
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:36,400
I am going to let it grow out.

1902
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:39,680
But when they get the fuzzy underside, it's going to be purple.

1903
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:43,920
Oh, I like I am going to have magneto hair.

1904
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:47,680
I'm going to shave freshly bald for Twitch Con.

1905
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:50,160
So. All right.

1906
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:53,040
Wait, Rob, I have to ask you,

1907
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:55,840
do you do it yourself or do you have someone do it?

1908
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:56,480
Alan, does it?

1909
02:28:57,600 --> 02:28:59,360
That way, I don't miss any spots or anything like that.

1910
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,840
I'm having I'm having Dan touch mine up.

1911
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:03,200
Nice.

1912
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:06,160
That is the purpose of a spouse to shave your head.

1913
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:08,400
All right.

1914
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:12,640
All right, my friend, Rama, anything else on your mind before we let you go?

1915
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:17,600
Give Alan some love for us, because we know he's he's dealing, you know.

1916
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:21,520
He's actually I think I said this at the very beginning, you weren't here yet, but him

1917
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:26,480
and I tested negative on the same day, except it was day 11 for me and I think day seven for him.

1918
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:28,320
But he had Paxlevid.

1919
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:36,960
He didn't get prescribed Paxlevid, but in a genius move by someone's health care company,

1920
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:41,520
they got Paxlevid showing up on their doorstep on day six after it was too late to take it.

1921
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:45,360
So it was too late for me, but it wasn't too late for him.

1922
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:47,120
So you know what I said?

1923
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:47,760
Just take it.

1924
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:48,240
And he did.

1925
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:51,280
And he got over it like, what, four days faster as a result.

1926
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,040
Hey, pay it forward.

1927
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:54,080
Exactly.

1928
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:55,760
And I'm a firework for cosplay.

1929
02:29:55,760 --> 02:30:00,480
I guess I guess I am admitting to some type of, you know, probably federal issue here.

1930
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:02,320
Look, he's my fucking husband.

1931
02:30:02,320 --> 02:30:06,560
And you would do it too for your spouse if you were in the same situation.

1932
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:11,840
So don't fucking come to me with, you know, the rules and regulations.

1933
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:12,400
Exactly.

1934
02:30:12,400 --> 02:30:13,280
Just does it on his own.

1935
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:14,320
Anyone would.

1936
02:30:14,320 --> 02:30:15,600
So all right.

1937
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:21,760
Um, and if you want to blame anybody, blame my health care provider for being so freaking

1938
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:25,680
messy, they didn't get me the meds until it was already day six and didn't even notice

1939
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:26,800
that it was day six.

1940
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:29,040
So you never got prescribed it at all.

1941
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:32,560
That's a whole other issue.

1942
02:30:32,560 --> 02:30:33,360
So anyway.

1943
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:35,280
All right, that's going to do it.

1944
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:37,040
Rama, thank you so much for calling in.

1945
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:38,560
Have a fantastic rest of your night.

1946
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:39,360
Okay.

1947
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:39,680
I will.

1948
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:41,840
You take care and y'all stay fabulous and awesome.

1949
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:42,240
All right.

1950
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:42,640
I will.

1951
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:44,160
It's all it's all I know how to do.

1952
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:44,960
All right.

1953
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:45,520
Bye, my friend.

1954
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:46,800
Bye.

1955
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:47,600
All right.

1956
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:51,600
Uh, let's see the whole reason I never got prescribed, by the way, is because I had a

1957
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:56,080
negative, uh, uh, test, uh, test there.

1958
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:57,840
And then I had a positive antigen test.

1959
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:01,120
That is so interesting.

1960
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:04,400
No, I was just like, I sent you the picture of my results too.

1961
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:04,720
I know.

1962
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:06,240
I was just like, Hey, I have diabetes.

1963
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:07,120
Can I get Paxilid?

1964
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:11,280
And then like three days later it was like, Oh no, I got the boilerplate answer first.

1965
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:13,040
And then three days later, Oh, I'm sorry.

1966
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:15,440
I was out of the office and I'm just now seeing this.

1967
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:17,280
I'll make sure you get it ASAP.

1968
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:20,800
And sure enough, it gets delivered up on my door the next day on day six when it's, you're

1969
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:23,040
not, and if you don't know, you're not supposed to take it after day five.

1970
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:24,720
It's ineffective after day five.

1971
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:28,240
So I'm pretty sure that that's why I never got prescribed it.

1972
02:31:28,240 --> 02:31:33,440
Cause I didn't get my days off and you know, I should have probably had it right at the

1973
02:31:33,440 --> 02:31:36,560
beginning given my other condition, but it is what it is.

1974
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:37,040
I'm with us.

1975
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:37,680
J one hundred mad.

1976
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:38,240
It's ridiculous.

1977
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:40,320
You can't just walk into a store and buy it at this point.

1978
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:48,480
I mean, but I understand though that there are people who don't have it, but I think

1979
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:52,720
and it needs to really be saved for the people who legitimately need it.

1980
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:53,920
It's fair, fair.

1981
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:54,320
All right.

1982
02:31:54,320 --> 02:31:59,200
I want to go to tweets over twitter.com slash O L R and dark Tetsuya reminding me of this

1983
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:00,160
other one.

1984
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:03,360
This other announcement for Tokyo game show and it was specifically Konami.

1985
02:32:03,360 --> 02:32:07,440
And you know, dark Tetsuya had something to say about the creators of La Mulana and what

1986
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:08,240
they're doing next.

1987
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:10,240
But I actually think this is pretty cool.

1988
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:17,760
So do you remember how Konami was running a competition for revitalizing one of their

1989
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,920
old franchises?

1990
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:24,080
If you were an indie developer and you had a good idea, they were going to help you basically

1991
02:32:24,080 --> 02:32:24,960
revitalize.

1992
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:31,760
So long story short, the guy behind La Mulana pitched a maze of galleous remake, which

1993
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:34,800
ironically was the game that inspired La Mulana and he won.

1994
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:40,160
So yeah, so that's the La Mulana.

1995
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:42,080
That's so interesting how that came full circle.

1996
02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:46,800
So it's the game that inspired La Mulana is now going to get a remake or redo by the La

1997
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:47,440
Mulana group.

1998
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:48,960
What's that?

1999
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:50,000
You know, he was tickled.

2000
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:53,040
Oh, well, he was and dark Tetsuya was, that's for sure.

2001
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:53,360
Yes.

2002
02:32:53,360 --> 02:32:54,240
Oh yeah, for sure.

2003
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:55,040
That's huge news.

2004
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:55,920
That's great.

2005
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:57,200
So all right.

2006
02:32:57,840 --> 02:33:01,040
If you want to send us some tweets, twitter.com slash O L R.

2007
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:04,400
But with that, that's the tweets, that's the emails, that's the calls.

2008
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:06,320
So that's the show.

2009
02:33:06,320 --> 02:33:08,160
We had a full show, fun show tonight.

2010
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:10,160
Thank you all for listening and tuning in tonight.

2011
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:11,040
Really appreciate it.

2012
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:15,760
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Tons Radio, please tell a friend or two about

2013
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:16,320
the show.

2014
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:19,280
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

2015
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:21,040
need more voices in the room.

2016
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:25,360
A nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you heard this show.

2017
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:27,920
Those nice five star reviews go an awful long way.

2018
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:29,680
So thank you so much for those.

2019
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:31,920
Be sure to follow us over at VOG Network.

2020
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:33,920
That's V O G Network on Twitch as well.

2021
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:35,440
That is also appreciated.

2022
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:37,840
That is it for now.

2023
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:39,920
We'll be back next week to do it all again.

2024
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:43,920
But just heads up, we will be off in early October.

2025
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:49,360
We are not going to be here the night of October 9th, I think it is.

2026
02:33:49,360 --> 02:33:50,800
You are correct.

2027
02:33:50,800 --> 02:33:51,920
That is TwitchCon.

2028
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:54,800
And you've heard Dark Soccer and I both talking about how we will both be there.

2029
02:33:55,520 --> 02:34:02,160
So, well, actually I may be back just in time, but I'm not going to push it.

2030
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:07,360
So Loki will be here and maybe he'll maybe he'll stream some of his big build or something.

2031
02:34:07,360 --> 02:34:08,080
I don't know.

2032
02:34:08,080 --> 02:34:10,400
But there will be no official we've done by then.

2033
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:11,860
Yeah.

2034
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:13,220
So.

2035
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:14,180
All right.

2036
02:34:16,400 --> 02:34:17,760
That is going to do it.

2037
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:21,440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2038
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:22,880
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

2039
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:27,760
I'm getting sick of all these motherfucking Weskers in this motherfucking game.

2040
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:28,560
Right?

2041
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:29,060
God.

2042
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:31,600
They need to nerve him.

2043
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:32,480
Oh, no.

2044
02:34:32,480 --> 02:34:35,760
On Friday when we were playing, we just all DC'd at the same time.

2045
02:34:35,760 --> 02:34:37,040
And you know, I don't DC.

2046
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:37,600
Yeah, I know.

2047
02:34:39,360 --> 02:34:42,080
His passive does not need to be as strong as it is.

2048
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:46,080
I don't know what they were thinking giving him that in addition to his already existing ability.

2049
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:49,040
His passive needs a huge nerf to it.

2050
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:53,520
Survivors do not need to gain the passive stuff as fast as they do.

2051
02:34:55,280 --> 02:34:57,920
And they shouldn't have nerfed a self-care.

2052
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:01,280
Their locations don't need to be given away when they use an antidote either.

2053
02:35:01,680 --> 02:35:05,040
So they need to nerf that, I think.

2054
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:06,560
And Wesker will be fine.

2055
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:09,840
Anyway, have a good stream, Dark Soccer.

2056
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:10,960
We'll see you next week.

2057
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:12,240
Thank you.

2058
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:14,560
I will see you all in whenever.

2059
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:16,160
Bye, everybody.

2060
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:16,560
Bye-bye.

2061
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:18,240
Let's go to Loki and your final thought tonight.

2062
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:22,160
I didn't really have too much other than I did want to mention I just saw there was

2063
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:26,000
another game announcement for Rise of the Triad Ludicrous Edition.

2064
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:31,120
It's a remaster of the original Rise of the Triad.

2065
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:35,920
Now in 4K, although, I mean, it doesn't really need to be in 4K because, you know,

2066
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:37,360
it was an old DOS game.

2067
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:40,720
But new map editors coming to all consoles and stuff.

2068
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:42,960
And they have a new episode in there as well.

2069
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:43,280
Nice.

2070
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:44,240
Yeah.

2071
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:48,960
My final thought tonight is speaking of streaming.

2072
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:51,360
I am finally coming back to streaming tomorrow night.

2073
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:56,080
Usually after post-DragonCon, I'm really high on the streaming train.

2074
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:59,120
I'm like, I'm super motivated to do stuff and create content.

2075
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:00,800
And then COVID said, ha.

2076
02:36:01,360 --> 02:36:04,000
So I've been out of it for a couple of weeks.

2077
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:04,960
I'm way overdue.

2078
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:09,200
I'm literally two weeks later and I wanted to be on this, but I will finally be streaming

2079
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:11,280
again tomorrow night after work.

2080
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:12,880
So please look forward to that.

2081
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:14,960
I will be doing some Final Fantasy 14 tomorrow.

2082
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:18,240
I'm actually thinking I'm going to have a schedule this week.

2083
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:23,920
And so as of right now, I'm going to do Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and I will be doing Final

2084
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:25,680
Fantasy 14 tomorrow.

2085
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:27,920
I think dead by daylight on Friday.

2086
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:31,440
And it's up in the air on what I'm going to do Wednesday, but something outside my normal

2087
02:36:31,440 --> 02:36:31,760
realm.

2088
02:36:31,760 --> 02:36:34,000
I might actually do Assassin's Creed Odyssey on Wednesday.

2089
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:39,040
So check that out over at my Twitch over at Rob Roberts.

2090
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:42,400
Tiger Claw says I'm still positive and haven't been able to go back to work.

2091
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:43,040
I'm sorry to hear that.

2092
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:43,920
Feel better.

2093
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:46,400
I hope it took me 11 days to test negative.

2094
02:36:46,400 --> 02:36:49,360
I've heard it takes some people a little longer.

2095
02:36:49,360 --> 02:36:51,600
So just crossing my fingers for you, Tiger Claw.

2096
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:52,400
I know it's no fun.

2097
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:54,720
Be safe out there, everyone.

2098
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:56,560
That's it.

2099
02:36:56,560 --> 02:36:57,360
Happy gaming.

2100
02:36:57,360 --> 02:36:58,480
Have a great week, everyone.

2101
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:01,280
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2102
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:01,840
Good night.

2103
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:30,640
Those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor VOG Network, but you know they were all

2104
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:31,520
still true.

2105
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:59,840
Bye.
