Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

22
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,060
where every gamer has a voice.

23
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:53,780
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 929 of our

24
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,400
show for tonight, September the 11th of 2022.

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,520
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined each week here to talk about video games, gaming

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,900
culture, the gamer lifestyle with my friends, although sadly not Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,980
tonight she has the night off, I'm just going to be real with everyone, it's been a week

28
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,900
trademark patent pending and so it's kind of a miracle that we're here doing a show

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,900
tonight but a nobody loves to miss two weeks of shows that's you know what's the secret

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,180
of doing a podcast for over 20 years make sure you stay regular right although I'm sure

31
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,140
everyone would have understood if we took another week off and I'm going to get into

32
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,140
why in a little bit we kind of push forward with tonight however Dark Sakura she is still

33
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,580
recovering from some under the weather stuff and it affects her voice so she's actually

34
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,840
not even doing really her personal streams she just is resting her voice and not talking

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,580
right now to make sure she fully recovers so obviously doing this show would be very

36
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,540
difficult in line with that vision so she has the night off so she can rest however

37
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:03,000
joining me tonight as he does usually do say hello to Loki hi Loki hello how are you doing

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,520
Loki I'm doing okay I guess yeah it's it's been a week for me and it's been a week for

39
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,880
you so my voice is a little off because I think many of you have already seen this on

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,900
like Twitter and social media I got COVID so I'm recovering and this you might be going

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,740
wait a minute didn't you already have COVID yeah I did about six or seven weeks ago I

42
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,380
already had COVID the first time so I had COVID for the second time and this time was

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,660
much worse it was very clearly a different variant because the symptoms were very very

44
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,940
different so if my voice does sound a little bit like like sultry smoker voice not that

45
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,160
I want to glamorize smoking here in the year 2022 but there was a time in my life when

46
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,340
I you know would go see the Rocky Horror Picture Show and smoke clothes behind the theater

47
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,540
I quit a long time ago thank you but my voice is getting back into that range right now

48
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,180
so if my voice does sound off that's what's going on so it's both Dark Sakura and I dealing

49
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,740
with illness issues but I I feel well enough voice wise to do the show and I'm also kind

50
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:15,120
of like I kind of I need to do OLR like after this week I've I've literally gotten to do

51
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,940
nothing I enjoy this entire week Dragon Con was great and I'll get into that in a minute

52
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,760
but I've gotten to do nothing I enjoy this week I always come back from Dragon Con extremely

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:32,480
motivated to make content and do stuff and this COVID put the brakes on all of that so

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,880
that's kind of been a bummer so I'm really glad to be back here doing OLR with you and

55
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,520

64
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,120
says you sound a bit off but not bad thank you dark to see it says yeah I notice it but

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,200
yeah it's fine yeah so I do I want people to know if my voice sounds different tonight

66
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,600
it's not like something in the podcast or it's just the fact that I'm recovering from

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:38,720
from COVID again um Loki you've also had quite a bit of a week I want to give you the space

68
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,300
to talk we will talk about video games uh and I know video games probably for both of

69
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,740
us have been a great and needed distraction this entire week um but I want to give you

70
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,980
some space to talk about your week as well Loki if you want to tell us better let's talk

71
00:04:51,980 --> 00:05:05,420
about my week so um let's see so last Sunday um my mom passed away so she had like like

72
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,560
when I picture like the worst case scenario as far as like how I look at my life as far

73
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,960
as like uh work sucks you know then you retire and then like then um you know you have that

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,200
time to like do whatever you want well so basically she retired last year and you know

75
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:31,160
she was looking to enjoy her retirement uh come around New Year's I think it's like shortly

76
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:39,760
after the first like shortly around New Year's time she got a minor stroke so obviously there

77
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,960
is something going on um so it wasn't too impactful she like lost a tiny bit of her

78
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,880
vision but for the most part was just normal um then they were trying to investigate like

79
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,960
some heart valve issue that she had um that they thought might have been causing the leaking like

80
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,440
causing clots because it was leaking or something like that um in March she had a full-blown stroke

81
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:15,000
which caused her um to lose more vision to lose the ability to speak clearly I guess it's basically

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,800
here speech center so the best you could do was like one or two words and a lot of times those

83
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,240
words would be the wrong words coming out um she could understand just fine but she couldn't like

84
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,240
really talk clearly and it was also like very very mumbly you know very quiet like strained almost to

85
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:42,200
talk um so then they kept pushing back her heart surgery because she obviously had the strokes and

86
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,200
they have her on blood thinners and like we're getting all that so in July she finally has her

87
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,120
valve replacement surgery and everything seemed like okay we're gonna finally address the source

88
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01,600
of the clotting oh and also before that they had she had like fibroids that they thought may have

89
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,240
been cancerous but they weren't able to kind of like tell if they were or not there it was

90
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,480
inconclusive if it was or not um so that was another thing that she would have had to have

91
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,240
a hysterectomy to address that as well as they were assuming that it was cancerous but they

92
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:24,760
weren't sure so anyways valve replacement surgery she's in the ICU for a while and it doesn't seem

93
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:32,000
to be she's having clotting issues now so she's losing blood flow to her hands and her feet and

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,840
tissues starting to die so like her fingertips are starting to go black and wither away her

95
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,800
toes are starting to do that as well so come to find out originally they thought it was an allergic

96
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,600
reaction to heparin which is a blood thinner but after doing different tests and after like

97
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:57,000
basically trying to treat everything they can they came up with the diagnosis that it's catastrophic

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:06,520
APS syndrome or anti let me pronounce this here antiphospholipid syndrome which is basically a

99
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:16,040
catastrophic means it's it's horrible it's very rare to have it that strong it's like one in

100
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,720
a hundred thousand or something like that and it's basically the immune system mistakenly attacks

101
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:29,200
the proteins in the blood causing clots everywhere so she was basically clotting her veins her

102
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:36,520
arteries organs everything which is extremely painful for her you know extremities and all

103
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:48,680
that stuff so fast forward now to gosh it was two weeks ago Monday so the beginning yeah the

104
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,400
beginning of the week from Sunday when she passed so Monday we had a meeting with the doctors and

105
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,120
the whole like nursing team and they basically said there's nothing we can do for her she's

106
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,680
dying so the start off the week I had to tell her because they aren't gonna do it I had to tell her

107
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,360
that she's dying so that was fun to have a conversation with somebody to let her down she

108
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,400
knew she knew what was going on you know obviously she was worried the entire time she wanted to go

109
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,080
home she didn't want to be you thought she was in the ICU for I think three to four weeks so which

110
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,120
is coming out of surgery you're supposed to be there for a couple days and that's it so clearly

111
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,400
knew what that something wasn't up and mean during that time it's possible like she was sleeping a

112
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:41,840
lot it's possible that she could have had other strokes we don't know but anyways she finally got

113
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:49,280
released into hospice care which is basically end-of-life care to us so we had her she was sent

114
00:09:49,280 --> 00:10:01,400
to her home to basically pass away to die so we brought her home on Thursday and then she was you

115
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,760
know it look she was still with it like on Friday and stuff like that and you know able to

116
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,680
communicate it seemed like you know she was comfortable and everything but it just it

117
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:20,080
progressed pretty fast you know we weren't able to you know keep her as comfortable we kept having

118
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,400
the up the morphine and stuff thankfully though because of them it's a horrible syndrome to die

119
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,600
from incredibly painful I can only imagine how scared she was but she was really out of it with

120
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,640
the Ativan and morphine that they were giving her or we were giving her so thankfully I don't think

121
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:45,120
she was really lucid but yeah so she passed away Sunday morning ironically enough my in-laws were

122
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,240
coming to visit and when I first got there Sunday morning I could tell like I could hear her

123
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,080
breathing she had the they called the rattles it's basically you lose the ability to swallow

124
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:05,240
and it's kind of like snoring I guess sort of it's horrible sounding but she was like very loud

125
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,320
when I got there and then like I remember like as the morning went on I was like yeah she seems to

126
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,000
be getting quieter now like I don't know maybe she's starting to pass or whatever and so I had

127
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,600
checked on her and she was I mean at that point she wasn't waking like opening her eyes at all

128
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,120
anymore for like the last 12 hours or whatever and then so by the time my in-laws came to visit

129
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:35,520
when we went back to the room she had passed already so very sad you know it's it wasn't as

130
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:44,120
hard like honestly to see her like pass away it's just knowing how much she suffered for the last

131
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:53,600
like gosh months so it was kind of a relief yeah that but yeah it sucks there's there's a lot

132
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,200
there's a lot of parallels from you know what I went through five years ago as well so I'm not

133
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,160
saying that in a way to make it about me but I'm saying that in a way where it's like I I can really

134
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,040
relate to like you know a lot of what I'm hearing and and so forth and just you know I encourage

135
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,080
you to look at chat right now there's a lot of love from a lot of people in our chat room right

136
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:20,480
now sending their regards and well-races and you're you're absolutely on you're absolutely

137
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,960
right about a couple things one she already knew she was gonna pass away like you weren't right

138
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,680
you weren't really breaking that news you were just probably giving her confidence in what she

139
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:37,300
already knew and you're you're right she's no longer having to suffer or anything so all the

140
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,960
decisions you all made were correct and it was tough like because we had to go visit her in the

141
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,600
hospital like we divide our time between myself and my sister to go visit her each day in the

142
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,960
hospital and it's just it's hard to see her like that it's just constantly like she's you know

143
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,240
looking at her fingers who I mean at the very least they thought okay you know if they can get

144
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,360
the clotting under control it may be that she loses her fingertips but she's able to you know

145
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:10,080
live a normal life and and it honestly if that's all it was it I mean it sounds horrible because

146
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,040
they're like even like I'm like do you have to amputate that oh no I'll just fall off like an

147
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:21,600
umbilical cord I'm like that's horrifying but they like if that's all it was because it was

148
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,320
under her non-dominant hand too that wouldn't be so bad I mean that would suck but it wouldn't be

149
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:34,080
so bad but yeah it was just unfortunate it sucks because like you know I'm looking forward to

150
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:40,520
retirement because I hate my job so it's like this is this is a potential outcome that sucks

151
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:49,680
well it it emphasizes also the very important this is why we have to do things now you know

152
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,240
we have to enjoy all the time that we have now because even getting to 65 and retirement is

153
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,600
never guaranteed yeah yeah it was only 67 is what yeah she wasn't so yeah yeah it's hard to

154
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,960
say I mean you never know you'd be like you can plan for an amazing retirement you still want to

155
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:14,000
take full advantage of your 30s 40s 50s and so on don't be a workaholic and not take advantage

156
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,800
of those fun things now of course yeah don't kill yourself over your job yeah uh but yeah it's it's

157
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:27,000
it's sad but at the same time it's like it's I mean I was expecting this outcome right weeks

158
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,760
ago so it wasn't wasn't unknown and like even like during like last week in this week it's just been

159
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,800
like trying to just get back to normal as quickly as possible just not worry about not focus on it

160
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,640
too much you know it's so it's it's been for the most part pretty okay well I haven't been too

161
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,800
upset about it but yeah it's hard to talk about every now and then but I mean at least she's not

162
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,960
suffering anymore so there's that well well thank you for sharing Loki I know I know it's a

163
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,120
difficult story to share but I think there's a lot you know I definitely identify with a lot of what

164
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,400
you're sharing and I think there's a lot of people in chat that this is hitting home for I think a

165
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:16,000
lot of us too many of us in the past few years have joined the lost parent or parents club and

166
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,200
there's a lot a lot a lot of hugs going around and chat and the family for you so yeah now we're

167
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:30,800
so worried about our grand my grandfather because he's 96 mm-hmm oh it's like yeah that's a matter

168
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,240
of time like cuz yeah she had lost her mom literally last year like almost a year you

169
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,760
know ago so yeah that was hard for her too and it's gotta be I can only imagine when he's going

170
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,920
through to losing his wife and then losing his daughter like that yeah I can't imagine well you

171
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,520
know in in big world news this week of course we know the Queen passed away and she was 96 you

172
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:01,480
know and there's a lot of kind of III obviously there her being a big political figure there's a

173
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,400
lot of takes all over this it which is interesting because she actually has nothing to do with

174
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,280
politics as I understand it she's more of a figurehead but there's way too many opinions

175
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:17,560
on a British monarch in America which is strange to me but I I'm gonna digress it's one of those

176
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:24,960
things where I think a lot of people kind of look at that and go well I mean she's she's 96

177
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,440
let her go quietly and without all this pomp and circumstance and the big deal that people are

178
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,920
making it out to be but I get that she's a different you know type of figure 96 is still

179
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,720
an incredible run you know and people are making all of these comparisons to oh she you know she

180
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,620
was around for this and this and this that happened at the toy she's she's as old as sliced

181
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,060
bread and all the same stuff they were saying about Betty White over here who was basically

182
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:55,460
the Queen of America so you know it's um you know 96 is an incredible run but my grandma made it to

183
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:03,300
99 so you know there might still be a few a few years to go and so many many get past 100 even

184
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:13,380
so yeah yep um so I guess speaking of enjoying things in the moment and doing things while you

185
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,940
can let's talk about my week two so I went to Dragon Con and that's why I missed last show I've

186
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:26,540
been going to Dragon Con for the past God since 20 2013 was my first Dragon Con so this would have

187
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,900
been basically my ninth because technically 2020 I don't count that one yes I know there was a

188
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,620
virtual year and many people still count that for their streak I don't this was the ninth year for

189
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:47,020
me so I would say nine Dragon Cons and one virtual Dragon Con so I went and I had a great honestly

190
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,580
I had a really good time this year the panels I got to host I had some really good ones and some

191
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:58,580
really good experiences Loki I got to do that Red Dead Redemption actors panel which is important

192
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,980
because they're not voice actors and everything in the promo said they were voice actors they

193
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,100
were voice and performance so they're really performance actors and we actually talked a

194
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,860
little bit about at the panel about kind of the difference and that's not it was never a discussion

195
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,540
about minimizing the importance of voice actors just pointing out that they're different art

196
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:22,100
forms right just like you can you can paint with watercolor you can paint with oil right it's it's

197
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,740
just different ways of making art so we talked a lot about the performance capture element of it

198
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,500
and kind of what made that difference over so they were they were a good group I was really happy and

199
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,340
honored to do that panel it was a Monday morning panel so it was not super well attended for a

200
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,340
ballroom panel but it still had a really good crowd there was somebody that came all the way

201
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,580
from China that asked a question and I was like wow that's pretty impressive so yeah it was um

202
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:54,300
it was a good panel I got to do on the video game track some discussions on diversity in games and

203
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,100
microtransactions in games sadly those panels weren't recorded so I don't think you'll see

204
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,180
them anywhere but they were they were a lot of fun to participate in and some really really good

205
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:09,260
points and things brought up I got to do a couple panels on the digital media track I got to do one

206
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,700
about streaming when you're over 40 years old and what was interesting about that that was an

207
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:20,780
interesting panel because we had some very very big name podcasters on that panel the macarons a

208
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,740
couple of the people from the family and they do my brother my brother and me I think is the name

209
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,260
of their big one and they have another big one that's D&D I think it's the whole family playing

210
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:37,100
D&D together some of that I I don't listen to a lot of stuff because I don't want to be influenced

211
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,620
the only shows I really listen to anymore are shows by drag queens and I can say the macarons

212
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,460
are not drag queens so they're just not in my wheelhouse for things I listen to because you

213
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,580
know there's a there's too many and B I don't want to be accidentally influenced or steal from

214
00:19:51,940 --> 00:20:00,060
another show but I I know these folks have a huge following that room was completely full and they

215
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:05,580
had people outside in the hall watching the streaming together while it was streaming out

216
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,100
of the room because the room could only hold like maybe 80 people so it was very interesting to do a

217
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:18,180
panel for other people's fans but I thought it was a good discussion and I thought Bobby did a really

218
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,780
good job moderating it and I thought and I will say the macarons were you could very easily be a

219
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,740
diva in a situation like that and they absolutely weren't they shared the space equally with the

220
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,820
rest of us that were on the panel and I just I really appreciate that and that says speaks to a

221
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,820
very high level of professionalism from them one of them used to be with joystick the blog years

222
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:44,220
ago so they know gaming and I think they they know Bobby from different circles and maybe me I don't

223
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:50,980
know but yeah yeah Bobby says it was technically vogs panel Bobby Bobby Bobby yeah we were the

224
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,260
ones who submitted it but nobody was there to see us well maybe I got actually people did try to

225
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,700
come to see us because I did hear from several people that just didn't realize they would have

226
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:10,100
to get to that panel an hour beforehand to see us so not to say nobody was gonna but just really

227
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:16,060
underestimated the star power I guess that was on that panel so yeah technically it was submitted

228
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,140
by us but it was fun I it was a good panel it was recorded so you will be able to see that on

229
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:28,620
YouTube in a couple weeks when they put that online it's on their twitch channel as well I did

230
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:36,980
another panel which was about I don't remember in the moment what was it oh it was the it was the

231
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:43,860
video to it was the audio to video one that I that vog has done in years past but this year

232
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,660
somebody else did it and Bobby and I were just kind of experts on that panel or whatever you

233
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,660
want to call it that was a good panel to sadly I oh no that one was recorded so I'll be on YouTube

234
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,300
as well sorry sometimes it's hard to keep track what isn't what isn't recorded and then I got to

235
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,900
do a panel on the horror track I know that one was not recorded in any way there's only a few pictures

236
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,380
out there of that but that was one on horror no respect and that was a lot of fun and I was really

237
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,660
jazzed to get to do a panel on the horror track this year with more of the hosting stuff that I

238
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,660
do on the side growing and so forth so that was all great so yeah I met a lot of great people

239
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:22,500
professionally an incredible dragon con professionally an incredible dragon con and I

240
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,220
really see I I'm I don't want to say too much because I don't want to jinx anything but it

241
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,100
looks like 2023 may be an even bigger and better year and that is really really exciting and I'm

242
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:39,740
gonna cross my fingers and toes for all that stuff but then you know I was staying with Bobby

243
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,700
Black Wolf at Black Wolf Manor and Mrs. Black Wolf I was staying there Monday night I used to fly home

244
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,700
on Monday night Labor Day but then we kind of made it a tradition I think the first year was maybe

245
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:57,740
2018 I think that I actually went and I stayed at Bobby's place and it's just it's a nice way to

246
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,420
decompress I got to see their house I get to you know he has that very nice theater sometimes we'll

247
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,980
watch a movie or I'll play a game or you know I think we were watching a little bit of twitch

248
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,820
this year because I think Alan was broadcasting a little bit so we watched him on the the big

249
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,500
screen and you know he has his arcade and I'll talk a little bit about that and all that stuff

250
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:23,340
so it just you know it's just so it's a nice way to like decompress after the con and then get on

251
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:29,260
the flight on Tuesday which is the way to do it and because the airport's a lot less fucky on

252
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,580
Tuesday too that's the other important thing and the flights are a little bit cheaper so all that

253
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:40,300
stuff is very cool Tuesday morning I wake up and I have a pretty bad sore throat and I'm like uh-oh

254
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:48,780
uh-oh but I'm thinking well this can't be COVID because I just had COVID seven weeks ago like I

255
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:54,060
should have antibodies for at least two months I'm I'm good and this is probably you know what

256
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:59,580
I've been taken in the air it's different here it's probably a little bit of concrete because

257
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,780
I was around a bunch of people even though I was masked when I wasn't on a panel I wore my mask

258
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,820
more than most people did and so forth I'm like it's just it's whatever it's just a little thing

259
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:16,380
I caught picked up whatever and I guess I probably could have taken a test but at the same time what

260
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,020
would that have done I was not going to impose on Bobby Blackwolf and Mrs Blackwolf to stay at

261
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:27,660
their house for an additional 10 days and I was not you know really prepared for that sort of

262
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:32,700
thing um and I didn't have any reason to really think it was COVID so I and I had to get to the

263
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:39,980
airport because my flight was going to be leaving so I went to the airport and I flew home and as

264
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:47,420
the day went on my day was getting a lot worse and I started to feel sicker and sicker and sicker

265
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,140
and when I got home I immediately took I'm sorry for the um noise that went through in the

266
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,460
background there I thought I had my alerts turned off uh sorry about that that is not you it is me

267
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:03,740
um I was getting sicker sicker so I took a test and I got home and bam it's COVID and it's it's

268
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:10,220
like the last time I had it I had just like a breath of fate a hint of a line but it was a line

269
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:19,100
this time solid red you're fucked line just shows up on the test so I was like great I just flew

270
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:26,460
home and exposed how many people to COVID but here's the thing can I sit around and feel guilty

271
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:32,620
all day about that no I wore my mask very well the entire way home because I knew if nothing else I

272
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,260
probably had con crud and so forth so I'm like you know what I'm gonna wear my mask diligently

273
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:46,780
I maybe took it off twice for five seconds to take us a down water and shove a handful of

274
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:53,660
pretzels in my mouth and that was it now did the people around me wear masks on the flight no

275
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:04,060
nobody nobody there comes a point where I can't be responsible for other people

276
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:09,420
that know the risk and so forth I did everything I could whether I had COVID or not

277
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:19,020
um speaking of precautions and all of that I I'm not I'm definitely not

278
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:26,060
mad at dragon con or any of that because that would be messed up I'm a big boy and I know

279
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,060
that I was going to a convention that was going to be attended by many many people and that there

280
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:37,980
would be a risk of COVID I thought falsely that my recent COVID would have given me extra protection

281
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,180
but even going into it I knew well weird things happen people can still get it and very clearly

282
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:51,500
I got some other type of variant so I'm a I'm a big boy and I own the fact that I knew the risk

283
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:58,380
I went into this situation I'm not mad at anyone for the fact that I have COVID but but me however

284
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:06,620
I was disappointed that the masking policy and adherence was nothing like it was in 2021

285
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:12,460
in 2021 dragon con man everybody wore their masks and it was you know you people kept it on the

286
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:18,540
whole time the masking was very good everyone did their thing this year it all fell apart and

287
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:24,540
I would say in the hallways and walking around the convention maybe somewhere between 20 and 25 of

288
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:30,220
the people were wearing masks and in the panel rooms maybe a little more because uh people would

289
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,020
some of the door people going into some of the tracks and events were reminding people to put

290
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,940
their mask on and maybe something a little bit more about the enclosed spaces I don't know I

291
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:45,100
could theorize the whole day but the masking was not what it was in 2021 however my understanding

292
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:54,140
is dragon con put out their masking policy only to be followed up by the cdc a week later who the

293
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,820
cdc now comes in and says masking is optional so everybody comes to dragon con and wants to start

294
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,540
pitching a fit and they start pointing at the cdc thing and go but the cdc says masking is optional

295
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:12,060
volunteers of dragon con get sick of this fight after having to do it so many times

296
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:20,780
I don't blame the volunteers for dragon con for giving up at some point the people that are temps

297
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:27,660
working at the hotel also decide to stop giving up this fight because the hotels basically decide

298
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,700
why should we be the bad guy why should the Hyatt the Hilton the Marriott why should we be the bad

299
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,300
guy when dragon con can be the bad guy it's their policy so they give up enforcing it at some point

300
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:45,500
it all fell apart because literally everybody gave up and I still believe something I said

301
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:52,780
from the very beginning precautions work they worked in 2021 they worked at games done quick

302
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:58,460
and those stories you hear from Bobby Blackwolf they didn't work here because there were no

303
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:07,900
precautions taken and that is the fault of the dragon con attendees so shame on y'all

304
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:17,420
you messed up but the reality is is this dragon con is this something unique to dragon con is

305
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:25,100
this dragon con's fault is dragon con a super spreader event no and if you're one of those

306
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,260
people on twitter or you're on social media that's sitting there going well people that

307
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:34,300
went to dragon con they should they should know better they they were going to a super spreader

308
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,980
event they're gonna go home and they're gonna get their family sick and they should feel bad

309
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,380
these people going to dragon con you're stupid if you're going to dragon con I have two words for

310
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:52,620
you fuck off and I'm gonna tell you something that's very ugly but you need to hear it you're

311
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:59,660
on twitter talking to random people because you don't have friends in real life that you can talk

312
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:06,460
to because you've pushed them all away with your shitty fuck attitude I'm telling you that because

313
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:12,780
I care and that type of behavior on social media where you're literally taking pleasure in people

314
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:25,260
getting sick needs to stop shut the fuck up now some people are going to feel very attacked by

315
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:31,020
what I just said and I want to be very clear on something I am very I am only speaking to those

316
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:37,740
people that go on to twitter and start to yell all of this stuff at people because they're taking a

317
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:43,420
risk and they're taking a choice and they know and going into these situations hosting and all

318
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,420
of this stuff that I do and leading panels and moderating and all this stuff this is my job

319
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:54,300
it's not my day job but it's my night job and sometimes I don't like to talk about it but

320
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,940
sometimes it's a paid job stop attacking me for doing things I need to do for my job

321
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:05,820
I knew the risks I weighed the risks and I went into the situation now back to my earlier point

322
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,140
or actually no I want to make sure I clarify this too because otherwise people are gonna

323
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,020
get their panties and wad because they're gonna take what I said out of context

324
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:19,820
if you are choosing to sit home because you don't feel safe at dragon con or any of this other stuff

325
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:28,460
I support you that's your right go do it do what you need to do you know I I understand

326
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,140
this is why we still have a lot of virtual things that are available this is why

327
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,540
zoom is so much more a part of our culture now than it was a few years ago and so forth

328
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:42,300
you have the absolute right to make that choice and do what you need to do for yourself I support

329
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:49,820
that so please if you're in that crowd do not mistake what I just said which is again people

330
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:56,300
attacking others for doing what they need to do that's not the same thing I want to make sure

331
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,820
that is very very clear I respect anyone who didn't go to dragon con because they just felt

332
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,060
a risk they wanted to take that's fine

333
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,620
the reason why I say is it dragon con's fault is dragon con a super spreader event and all

334
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:20,060
this stuff and I say no is because let's be real if I hadn't gotten this at dragon con

335
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:25,420
because I didn't the first time I would have got it somewhere else like I did the first time

336
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,860
I would have got it at a restaurant I would have got it at work I would have got it at Costco

337
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:36,220
I would have got it at the grocery store I would have got it at the movies I would have got it

338
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:43,740
walking going on walks at the gym I would have got it into at one of hundreds of other places

339
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:54,860
because society has decided we're done with precautions and precautions work but without

340
00:32:54,860 --> 00:33:02,620
precautions nothing works anymore that is society's fault not dragon cons dragon

341
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:11,100
con's just one part of society so I I so do I regret going to dragon con absolutely not

342
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:19,340
I'm disappointed and frustrated that a the the masking and all that stuff because again you can

343
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,980
say you can believe I can still say all of this that people should be able to take risk and go

344
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,460
into these situations do what they need to do for their jobs their careers their mental health

345
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,300
let people make that way decision and whatever they need to do I can say all that that is not

346
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:39,980
an anti-masking stance because I can say that and I can also say but we should still take precautions

347
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,140
like getting vaccinated wear your mask and do everything you need to do both of those things

348
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:52,300
in my head are true so that's that's what it is and unfortunately though the the cloth over people's

349
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,660
face has proven to be too much after two years and uh it is what it is it is what it is that's

350
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:04,060
that's society's problem to figure out why we we can't bring ourselves to do that after a few years

351
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:10,700
so uh getting some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network s2100 matt says people

352
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,700
need to understand that many folks are taking risks into their hands it's their choice and they

353
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:19,420
have their reasons mental health is a big reason many folks want to enjoy life the best way they

354
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:27,660
can in this situation yeah exactly exactly and you know what I know a lot of people that saw

355
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:33,180
lady gaga either this weekend within the week or last week you know how many people were at those

356
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:40,700
concerts more than were at dragon con now granted it was outdoors but you see how tight all those

357
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:49,660
people are sitting together it's a it's a risk and what and the reason why I said what I said

358
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:54,940
and I was really nasty to people that need to hear something nasty because their behavior it's

359
00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:00,220
just a reflection of their behavior right now because there are so many of those people that

360
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:06,460
are attacking people on twitter making certain decisions and so all this stuff there are so many

361
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:13,260
people that say that stuff and then turn around and justify but I'm gonna I need to do this one

362
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:24,940
thing that's the behavior that pisses me off is that people will blame dragon con attendees

363
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:30,780
but then talk about their twitch con plans or their anime con plans or their packs plans or

364
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:37,340
whatever it is or their concert they're gonna go to or I can't miss this particular thing or

365
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:43,740
I've got this big family birthday party coming up or whatever it is like the hypocrisy smells it's

366
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:51,180
so bad anyway DJ Ramez says people also forget one thing we are still in a pandemic yes true

367
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:58,940
she-hulk 10 says it's scary especially long COVID absolutely and it sucks and I hope some of these

368
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:06,380
symptoms I'm not going to have for a long time but again this was something that is because of

369
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:14,460
the way society is right now in every place I was probably going to get it eventually well I did I

370
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,300
did and I did I did get it one time already the only thing that really sucks is the fact that I

371
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,500
know now that Alan got it too and at least you don't have kids because that's a whole other

372
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:32,620
entry vector oh god don't you want to talk about another thing but anyway great point

373
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,780
excuse me I will try to mute myself and not cough into the mic but I'm sure you all understand it

374
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:47,100
may happen tonight I got Alan sick we tried our best to distance at home stay apart and so forth

375
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:54,060
and of course I feel bad of course I don't I don't like that this has happened but Alan's

376
00:36:54,860 --> 00:37:00,380
you know in in his typical graceful wonderful way has said you know what it's been 30 months

377
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,100
this is going to happen eventually and he has a very similar outlook I do if it didn't happen now

378
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:11,500
it was going to happen like you got it before and I didn't or you know when it was restaurant or the

379
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,860
gym or something else like this has got it was going to happen eventually so uh she-hulk 10

380
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:23,340
in chat says hopefully it will weaken like the flu and die out soon that's it it does seem to be

381
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:31,100
the way it's going I am not a scientist I can say what I had this last week sucked

382
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:38,460
it was bad it was worse than a cold it was worse than a sinus infection but it wasn't as bad as

383
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:45,420
swine flu I will say that so you might remember that was the thing that we here at OLRL got to

384
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,340
deal with about 10 years ago I know if longer than that probably 12 years it wasn't as bad

385
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:59,500
as swine flu in my opinion but it was up there all right um anyway I know I've said a lot and

386
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,540
like none of it has been about games but I think it was important to say and um you know if I if

387
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:09,580
I made you angry with something I said I just I just want you to stop and think about some of the

388
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,100
things that you say and you put out on social media and so forth and put yourself in other

389
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,900
people's shoes and again you have the right to make your own decisions on what is best for you

390
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:26,220
that is 100 understandable it is not okay for you to attack other people blame other people

391
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:32,300
or make people feel guilty because we're doing the things we need to do to keep our lives in

392
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:41,820
wellness and running and in good state getting covid is not a moral failing repeated after me

393
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,340
getting covid is not a moral failing

394
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:56,540
society our leaders had a chance to minimize and reduce this two years ago in 2012 really in 2019

395
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:03,900
and gone into 2020 we as a society and the leaders that lead us failed to do that we are now all

396
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:14,380
paying the price so if you want to blame something blame that uh looking at chat over at twitch.tv

397
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,460
slash vog network uh bobby blackwell says I respect everyone's risk tolerance and will no

398
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:23,740
longer try to pressure even if it's mock pressure people to come to conventions with vog yeah let

399
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:30,460
people know their options it's what it is uh yeah uh mike defton chat says I'm angry that people

400
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,780
don't actually listen yeah and uh dg ramas says I've been saying similar things for the last two

401
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:41,500
years on my podcast well if you think about it rama it's because we're both right all right I

402
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,900
had to sneak something out there all right let's actually get into some gaming news now that we're

403
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:51,420
what 45 minutes into the show uh hi dark soccer I see dark soccer joined the chat room so uh maybe

404
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:58,140
giving us some thoughts there uh virtually tonight so all right let's get into um excuse me some

405
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:03,580
actual gaming news uh loki you want to start us I have a lot of opinions on this too can't wait

406
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:09,980
you want to start us off with this yeah we can talk about this so um there was the whole d23

407
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:16,620
convention thing this week so there are lots of different announcements by disney regarding marvel

408
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:24,060
star wars lucas arts uh disney properties and different things with that so one of the

409
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:31,340
announcements was a brand new niantic game called marvel world of heroes that is supposed

410
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:38,620
to be coming out in 2023 they had a trailer for it and it looks generic af I don't even know what

411
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,940
the hell this is supposed to be but apparently you're supposed to be able to thwart crime take

412
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:50,940
on missions do nonsense I don't know and you team up with your friends as well as superheroes not

413
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,380
a single frame of game shown of course but this is as is tradition as is tradition for many of

414
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,140
these niantic announcements remember the very first pokemon go announcement did not have a

415
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:05,500
frame of gameplay in it I believe whenever it was they announced wizards unite although that was not

416
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,700
a niantic game that was um portkey games used in partnership with niantic using their stuff

417
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,180
um that I don't believe we saw a frame of footage in the launch trailer either so this is this is

418
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,620
par for the course so we know it's something to do with marvel superheroes and apparently in an

419
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:27,180
interview with one of the developers kind of gets into it's creating your own superhero which is I

420
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,180
guess somewhat of a first in these marvel games I didn't realize there were like no other marvel

421
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,860
games that you where you couldn't create your own hero um but I guess it also does kind of make

422
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:40,060
sense and it sounds like they're aiming for a very robust character creator that reflects you know

423
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:46,860
all the the spectrum of our society and all this stuff right now um so um I mean lego marvel

424
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:52,620
superheroes can create your own characters as well but yeah yeah okay well yeah so yeah I don't

425
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:57,500
but I I they were so I'm only saying that because it was in the interview or whatever they were

426
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,300
saying like oh well we're like the first so I don't I don't know what it is that they're they're

427
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:07,260
first thing but yeah there it is so and dark soccer is saying midnight suns and there was

428
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,380
another marvel phone game as well so some somebody over there is full of it or there's well there

429
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,660
there's one element of it that's new well midnight suns was it's going to be a brand new game but

430
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:24,300
like um there's yeah they have another like game coming out with um captain america and black

431
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,420
panther as well I'm not really sure that's all about but uh yeah this this I saw it I was like

432
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:37,500
cool except also like I don't know it's like doesn't there's so many niantic games that are

433
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,780
being announced and it's like will it really come out yeah we're seeing a lot of things we're not

434
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:48,300
seeing a lot of receipts for the announcements I think it's starting to to bug some people and I

435
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:54,460
get it how many games have they worked on that they just went eh well katan got cancelled we

436
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:58,060
know that one right it was being tested in australia new zealand and a couple other countries

437
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:04,300
as well and they they yanked it um so there's that oh questbusters clarifying in midnight sun

438
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:10,780
you can customize the hero but the hero is a new character created by marvel for the game

439
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,860
so that's the element because I believe in this one the hero is supposed to represent

440
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:19,980
you so you are this so I think that's what they're getting at but we're really getting into

441
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,020
weeds whatever like it doesn't matter as long as the game plays it doesn't it doesn't matter

442
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:30,860
it's the gameplay right it doesn't matter about the character so um although it would be nice if

443
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,020
all these this wide spectrum of society is something that is reflected in the game that's

444
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:41,340
great let me just put it this way now I take it's very easy you'll never recapture pokemon go

445
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:47,180
ever again you can try but it's never gonna happen again that lightning doesn't strike twice even

446
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:52,700
though you have thor but it's just it's never gonna happen I'm sorry you can throw whatever

447
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:58,220
property you want at this it's just not gonna happen um katan ever didn't happen transformers

448
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:02,700
but I believe that was also a third party making that in partnership with niantic that got cancelled

449
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:08,220
niantic laid off some of their staff we don't know why I suspect they were trying to push the

450
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:14,620
more google glass kind of ar gaming a little sooner maybe than it was ready um and maybe

451
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:20,220
that's but I I really don't know I can only speculate um but we also we know niantic has

452
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:26,540
announced recently a uh a game called peridot uh an original ip that we don't know anything about

453
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:31,180
yeah I'm more interested in something like that like I think honestly all these like

454
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:38,300
I mean pokemon was kind of a one-off but like it's just there's no property that really gets

455
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:43,420
me excited I love marvel stuff but like I am not excited at all about this and I get it I may not

456
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:48,460
be their target demographic although I don't know who would be then at that point but like it's just

457
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,380
I like the Pikmin game but I've talked about that a lot on the show and that is more I also

458
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:00,380
unlike you I have a default love for the ar and get outside and explore kind of games I've always

459
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:06,140
been a fan of niantic and that genre so that's you know that's it's obviously something um

460
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,860
something there um so uh what else do we know the nba game was announced that is coming but

461
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,860
we don't know much about that either so I think that's what the problem people are starting to

462
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,940
have when niantic is is that you're you're announcing too many things that either don't

463
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,980
come out or we don't know anything about it so niantic might want to re-examine their pipeline

464
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,900
from announcement to release because they've got too much now that they've announced that

465
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:35,740
they haven't released I get that they they made the announcement now because d23 so yeah that's

466
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,580
fine that makes sense it didn't it didn't have to be d23 it could have been any time

467
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:47,660
but here's here's why I think it's actually super newsworthy um is because when pokemon go came out

468
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:54,460
everybody tried to copy it and make their own type of pokemon go I don't think anyone was

469
00:45:54,460 --> 00:46:01,180
successful at it what we had garfield go uh we had draconian go or whatever it was called

470
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:06,380
we had the jurassic park game which I feel like a couple people played that but I don't even think

471
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,740
that one's a big deal anymore and we just have seen that like in general other companies trying

472
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:17,980
to take on the strength of pokemon go wasn't working and I said from the very beginning it's

473
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:24,220
going to take a very strong ip to compete with pokemon go in fact I think the only company

474
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,100
that could really take on pokemon go would be disney

475
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:36,220
so the part of this news that strikes me as oh that's interesting is that disney isn't taking

476
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:42,700
it on they're partnering up so from my perspective whether you like it or not

477
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:48,540
niantic is now going to have the monopoly on these ar games for quite some time

478
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:55,900
until someone else can figure out a way to build a database of real world locations and collecting

479
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,860
this type of information that niantic is cleverly getting from their player base like portal scans

480
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:05,180
and pokestop scans and all this stuff that shows the stuff on the ground all this

481
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:10,540
unless another company can really think of a way to take that on in a way that niantic is now

482
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:18,220
already two or three steps ahead with this is this is like microsoft and game pass niantic is now

483
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:24,460
already three steps ahead of anyone else and this disney partnership now that there's nobody even

484
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:31,820
in the rearview mirror at this point so I that part to me is what's interesting is that yeah

485
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:37,020
disney just decided if he can't beat him join him mike defton chat says if you can't beat him

486
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,180
buy him I don't could could could disney buy niantic at this point I don't know

487
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:45,100
niantic may be too much money I I think they're worth a lot more than people think

488
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:51,580
but then again disney certainly has no shortage of money so I don't think disney wants to get

489
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:58,460
into gaming per se and they have lucasarts but like they're not really doing much with gaming

490
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:03,420
like it's very clearly they have no interest in making their own ar game so they are letting

491
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:08,140
niantic do it right so I don't think that they would purchase niantic I don't think they're it

492
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:16,060
yeah because for what yeah it like it would have to be like an amazing success like beyond pokemon

493
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:24,460
go to even drum up interest enough to do that yeah the the reason why someone will buy niantic

494
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:32,460
won't be the um games themselves it'll be the data niantic is amassing about the usage and

495
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:37,020
what the ground really looks like at some of those areas and stuff but that's that's the type of data

496
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,500
somebody's gonna want to buy from niantic at some point which is why niantic is kind of smart to

497
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,620
sort of license it in their own thing with the whole light shift but that's a whole

498
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:51,980
whole other thing anyway I think this is very interesting um again it's hard to say uh if the

499
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:56,380
game is going to be any good or not when we have literally not even seen one frame but just as

500
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:01,180
someone who's generally a fan usually of niantic stuff and I've talked at length about them on the

501
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:07,900
show um I wish them well I want to see it be good um good luck I can't wait to actually get my hands

502
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,780
on it hopefully so all right let's talk about the things we have gotten our hands on in this past

503
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:18,860
week let's talk about our gaming weeks I know I've had a lot low-key what about your gaming week what

504
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:25,100
do you mean it's all been minecraft I've been working on a single build for about a month now

505
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:33,260
designing it so it's now being it's done being designed it's probably going to be the largest

506
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:39,580
thing I've ever built I think you're gonna like it you just had something that you built that was

507
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:45,500
like the largest thing you ever built so you're one yeah that was yeah that was a mountain uh

508
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:51,580
a while back those 200,000 blocks I think this is like 300,000 at least it's very large it is

509
00:49:51,580 --> 00:50:00,540
incredibly large but it it's pretty awesome it is mega man themed oh cool but it is it it is not my

510
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:06,060
mega base but it could it could have been my mega base if if I really wanted to be it's that big

511
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:12,140
but it is not a mega base it is just decoration the copper farm all right well everyone stay

512
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:17,580
tuned to Loki's uh youtube channel to uh check that out when it hits all right well as I've been

513
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:23,660
home sick and I I was I was supposed to go back to work Thursday obviously I didn't I've been home

514
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:27,180
pretty much sleeping and playing video games so I've had a lot uh and then of course there was

515
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,620
Dragon Con as well so pull up a chair I've got a few things to get into but I'll try to be quick

516
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:36,220
the game I've been playing most this week this week and weekend is Diablo 3 which I know is

517
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:41,260
kind of old but I've talked about it before I recently got back into it because I didn't really

518
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:47,660
care for Diablo Immortal um after the first 40 levels or so but um it made me realize I really

519
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:54,540
like Diablo 3 and I've been enjoying season 27 I'm up to Paragon 650 which is higher than I've

520
00:50:54,540 --> 00:51:02,220
ever gotten Paragon wise Alan is up to 1200 uh in the season in the season not overall so uh

521
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,340
we've been both playing a lot of that game but it's been something we've been able to play

522
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:10,140
together which is cute so uh we've been having fun with that I have a wizard and I'm up to

523
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,020
greater rift level I think I cleared 90 earlier so I'm trying to work my way up into the hundreds

524
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:22,620
um I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14 Final Fantasy 14 right before I left for Dragon Con

525
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:28,460
released the new island sanctuary mode which is interesting because I know Disney also put out

526
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:33,900
their own Disney dream light which is kind of like this you know farming sim animal crossing sim sort

527
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,700
of game well they've also put something like this into Final Fantasy 14 with the island sanctuary

528
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:45,980
you go around and you gather materials you build things you then uh use the workshops to uh build

529
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:51,500
things you can export for items that you can then turn into cosmetic rewards like mounts and things

530
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:56,540
and all this stuff so you build up your island you can capture animals you keep them in a little part

531
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:02,220
of your sanctuary you grow plants so like it's got this whole little farm sim mode that's very

532
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:07,500
addicting in it right now that's been a lot of fun so I'm logging into that like every day to um

533
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:12,700
progress my island sanctuary so I don't raid my only savage content I do right now is savage

534
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,940
island sanctuary um and I've been having a lot of fun with that I've still been continuing in Dead

535
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:22,940
by Daylight as well uh they just released the project W or the um second Resident Evil pack

536
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:28,940
um which has made way too many Weskers in the killer pool um but he is an interesting killer and

537
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,980
uh you know very very hot like everybody from Resident Evil is so hot like I don't what what

538
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:40,700
is up like now I play Carlos super hot Ada Wong I also really hot like everybody is so hot from

539
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:45,660
Resident Evil um but I've been having fun playing the new characters um and just you know in general

540
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:53,260
leveling up um on the plane ride out to Dragon Con I played some Super Mario Brothers 2 on my Switch

541
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:59,420
because I was like I want to play a retro title and uh you know uh play something I can play start

542
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:07,900
to finish um on a plane ride so that's what I've been playing um then when I was at Dragon Con

543
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:14,780
Dragon Con had a whole little um they had two arcades they had a classic game room that was

544
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:20,460
also a bar and karaoke place and at the classic game room I got to play a bit of gyrus I actually

545
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:25,100
had the high score no I'm sorry the second high score on the gyrus machine for a hot minute because

546
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:30,060
I actually can still remember from the Commodore 64 days where the ship needs to be positioned in

547
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:34,620
the first few stages to get a perfect on everything so that's kind of fun I played some Street Fighter

548
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:39,260
2 with some friends that was very old school uh e Honda if you were wondering uh and then I played

549
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:43,340
some Mortal Kombat 2 as well so they had some great classic games and then I thought this was

550
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:49,980
really funny I watched my friend my friend saw this machine and he goes oh my god it's Galaga

551
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,820
I gotta go play Galaga I used to play so much Galaga when I was growing up and I was like

552
00:53:54,620 --> 00:54:00,300
are you are you talking about Galaga he's he's like Galaga we always call the Galaga and I was

553
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:06,140
like I I think friend I think um I think it's Galaga because like galaxy it's galaxy if you're

554
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:14,860
in the galaxy it's Galaga what no it's it's Galaga and I was like okay well I watched him proceed to

555
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:21,100
get a very very large score on the Galaga machine so he was not just making this shit up he played

556
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:25,740
a lot of Galaga growing up and was still able to do very well for himself and it was the same thing

557
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:33,260
he knew everywhere you needed to be on the screen and so forth and all that stuff so dark soccer and

558
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:39,580
chat says you were always wrong here's the thing he's a friend I'd like him to stay my friend

559
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:47,020
is there hurting anything do I need to shit on his childhood no I I said what I needed to say oh

560
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:52,220
oh I thought it was Galaga like galaxy and he did acknowledge oh yeah you're probably right

561
00:54:52,220 --> 00:55:01,020
and then continued to call it Galaga why why should I stop that what it's there's no harm in it

562
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:09,500
um and uh there was also a Japanese arcade so they used to have Tokyo Attack was the name of

563
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:15,740
the arcade but they Tokyo Attack went under for reasons and things um a couple years ago

564
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:21,980
so now there is a um a new company I think they're called Savepoint Arcade uh Bobby may have to

565
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,700
correct me on the name if I'm wrong but uh they were the ones that now come out and they brought

566
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:33,900
the Japanese like uh centered machines to the con and they had like a BeatMania 2DX Beastrover

567
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,060
I didn't realize they were gonna have freaking EMUs turned on or I would have turned on EMUs

568
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:44,060
so Bobby even got me some footage um of playing that game which he showed on his own show and

569
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:49,900
that was cool to play 2DX machine he they also had a BeatMania the final I hadn't seen one of

570
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:57,020
those machines since god did we go to like I think it was little Tokyo in LA was the last place I

571
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:02,140
ever saw one of those BeatMania the final machines so that was a trip to see that and I could not

572
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:07,500
remember how to play the songs uh on that game arcade infinity I think it's the last time I saw

573
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:13,020
that yeah yeah uh Bobby Blackwolf and chat says save point yes technically they aren't a new

574
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:18,300
company but they have stepped into the business that Tokyo Attack had okay awesome uh and then

575
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,700
the other game I got to play they had a lot more but the other game I actually played was Dance

576
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:27,500
Maniacs because you know if you've it's the one where you wave on the top and on the bottom and

577
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:34,460
it's a lot of fun and I miss that game so uh yeah I got to uh play a little bit of that so um Dark

578
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:39,260
Soccer I do not think this is the same group that does California Extreme because I I they're East

579
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:43,900
Coast based now granted if they're based in Maryland as Bobby says that is still quite the

580
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,980
trip uh but probably coming all the way out to the West Coast is even more of a trip there's

581
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,980
probably another company on the West Coast that does a lot of this stuff out here so um yeah and

582
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:56,780
if the 2DX machine was different then it probably wasn't the same group um but there's probably a

583
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,420
very similar group on the West Coast for sure um but getting over the Rockies with all those

584
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,700
machines is probably a big pain in the butt so you're probably always going to have your West

585
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:08,540
Coast and your East Coast and maybe maybe a Midwest company in there too who knows

586
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:15,660
um and then uh I I know the one you all want to hear about is uh the night I did stay at

587
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:20,540
Black Wolf Manor you know that Bobby Black Wolf has his own arcade right and he has his own

588
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:28,140
uh a few machines he has a Tron machine uh well these are these are um arcade one-ups like the one

589
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,580
the one behind me if you're watching live on Twitch if you're on the podcast feed you don't

590
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:36,460
see it but I have a Burger Time or a Data East arcade one-up replica cabinet

591
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:44,460
uh that sits behind me here um so uh Black Wolf has a Tron one and I joked and I said for some

592
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:48,460
time Bobby I'm coming over to your house I'm getting the high score on your Tron machine

593
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:55,820
and all I did all I did audience I did simply what I was going to say or what I said I was going to

594
00:57:55,820 --> 00:58:02,540
do and I got the high score on his Tron machine with some practice it wasn't a great score so

595
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,220
with some practice Bobby will take it out in the next year and then he'll rub it in I'm sure and

596
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:11,580
it'll be fine I also played his Star Wars machine I did not get the high score on the Star Wars

597
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:15,260
machine I think if you wanted to get the high score on that machine you needed to start on

598
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:21,340
level nine and get the bonus for beating level nine I didn't do that so there was there was that

599
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:27,100
uh I also got to play pinball at Bobby's house Bobby has a Mandalorian machine which I think

600
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:32,620
he had last year because I remember playing that before um but he now has a Rush like the band a

601
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:39,180
Rush pinball table that was a lot of fun to play this was really cool I didn't know anything about

602
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:45,100
this until well it's like I heard here's the thing I'd heard of it and it's one thing to hear it

603
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:50,540
it's another thing to see it and do it and use it and this is the first time I used it

604
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:57,340
and that was Stern's QR code system they have now so they have this site that you can log into

605
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:04,380
uh with Stern pinball and you can actually scan a QR code on machines when you play them so it's

606
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:10,540
insider.sternpinball.com and there's this uh uh thing oh damn it I'm not logged in I was I was

607
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:15,820
going to show you the site otherwise um and you can log in a machine by scanning your QR code

608
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:20,380
and the really cool thing about that you get achievements and it tracks on your phone the

609
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:25,100
things you played and you have your own personal records and stuff like that and I think that is

610
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:32,460
brilliant because it brings something additional to pinball besides just pinball which is great

611
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:38,140
don't get me wrong but the thing with that is that you pay your dollar and you're done and you rarely

612
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:42,860
have anything to show for it it's like okay I had my little thrill for the experience I knocked some

613
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:49,340
balls around teehee and I'm done but now with this QR code thing if it's set up on the machine

614
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:53,340
not every Stern machine has them it's a separate thing they sell but Bobby Bobby put it on his

615
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:58,860
machines that he has with this QR code thing you scan the QR code thing and you get achievements

616
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:04,220
and you get to track your scores and all this really cool stuff so I played the rush table one

617
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:09,100
time and then Bobby told me about the QR code thing and I was like oh cool I gotta try that

618
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,940
and I'm like I want to get some achievements so let me try the rush table again I want to get some

619
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:19,980
achievements so I played the rush table again with my QR code and all this stuff and um balls

620
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:27,100
one and two didn't go so well ball three I went on a fucking bender on ball three I was alive for

621
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:33,100
a very long time on ball three and um I beat Bobby's high score on the rush machine too

622
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:40,540
oh that one I felt a little bad about because I didn't walk in there intending to do that

623
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:48,620
so I may or may not have gotten myself into a little hot water and there may or may not

624
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:55,180
literally be a sign outside of Bobby's arcade with my face on it at this point that says have

625
01:00:55,180 --> 01:01:01,740
you seen this man or whatever it is and I just happen to have a shirt that day that said um

626
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:04,300
sorry I was mean to you on the internet

627
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:12,860
which I'd randomly bought at the mall uh a few weeks ago so I I said that so at that point I

628
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:18,300
wanted to play Mandalorian again I think I played it once just to like register that I'd played as

629
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:24,300
I was too afraid to do well on that machine because I don't want to make Bobby Blackwolf

630
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:30,140
cry like I don't want to make him cry like he's been very good you know what we have a good time

631
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:35,340
at Dragon Con we do some great business partner things together I got to watch him moderate some

632
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:39,820
awesome panels with the guys from Mortal Kombat and all this stuff he lets me stay at it I don't

633
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:46,700
want to make him cry so I had to I had to purposely kind of have a quick game of Mandalorian and let

634
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:54,700
that let that be that so luckily Mrs Blackwolf has already told me that she does not recognize

635
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:59,740
or authorize the ban or the signage that is outside the arcade so Mrs Blackwolf has

636
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:08,620
said I am welcome whenever I want so um Dark Soccer says Tron is at my house right now oh

637
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:13,580
the machine or the table because honestly I'd play either uh you probably don't want me coming over

638
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:18,780
right now uh but maybe in a week or so I'd love to come uh play that uh Dark Soccer says did my

639
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:24,620
friend Annie ever come by to say hi uh no I didn't I didn't meet any Annie so sorry to say but um

640
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:30,700
it there was no uh Dead by Daylight panels or anything like that so um I don't know if she's

641
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:34,780
your friend from that circle or somewhere else I don't know but um yeah didn't run into him

642
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:40,860
I will say one of the panels that we did was was the line capped an hour before the panel

643
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:45,820
and it seems like a lot of people who are trying to say hi to me or Bobby tried to come to that

644
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:52,620
panel uh and it was capped an hour beforehand because the Macarons were also on that so oh she

645
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:57,820
hosts some I heart podcast no I didn't see her sorry to say so um I guess there's always Dragon

646
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:05,100
Con 2023 because I I will be back I sure will I'm bummed that booster shot that's out there

647
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:09,180
now wasn't available two weeks sooner because I absolutely would have got it you know precautions

648
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:16,300
work but it is what it is when precautions are not followed here I am I follow them but everybody

649
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:21,740
has to follow them for them to work all right that's plenty enough about my gaming week oh I

650
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:25,420
should have mentioned the tilt five because Bobby did let me try that for the first time do you know

651
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:33,260
what the tilt five is Loki oh okay so long story short it's these glasses you wear and you stare

652
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:38,300
at this table thing it's they made it more for board games I think Bobby heard about it at Gen

653
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:43,500
Con but they have you know other like concept video games I I played a thing that was we'll

654
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,580
call it marble madness it wasn't actually marble madness but it was like a marble madness type of

655
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:52,460
thing or a monkey ball type of thing and you stare at this table and you see the image on

656
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:56,860
the table and as you look around it like moves with you and so forth because like it's like

657
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:02,060
projecting from the glasses onto this reflective material that's on the table and so it makes it

658
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:08,140
look like it's like um it's it's like a it's not VR it's a little more like AR but it's it's pretty

659
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:14,860
cool um till five is Jerry Ellsworth's AR goggles she was working on the valve cast AR before they

660
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:20,940
went VR that's Bobby's little summary there that was neat to see um but I didn't really get to

661
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:26,220
play any games on it it was just one concept demo so I'll be curious I watched Bobby do something

662
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:30,300
that looked a little Diablo-y to me and I was like what's that and he was uh because I guess

663
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:34,060
they had released some update and some new demos while we were at Dragon Con so he was kind of

664
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,900
trying them all for the first time so it feels like one of those things that still has a little

665
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,980
baking to do um so I'll be curious to see what kind of experiences they put on that that are

666
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:47,900
uniquely um for that tilt five okay now I have definitely talked too much about my gaming week

667
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:55,580
so let's get into some other gaming news uh let's get to it Loki yeah so there was also an Ubisoft

668
01:04:55,580 --> 01:05:03,180
event where they talked about game announcements in a couple franchises um so some of the non

669
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:09,100
Ubisoft Assassin's Creed and Division announcements we had Mario and Rabbids

670
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:15,580
Sparks of Hope they showed off some more um a new trailer I think for that and that's set to come

671
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:27,340
out on the Switch October 20th and um also uh more on Skull and Bones still on its way um apparently

672
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:33,500
if uh you are part of Ubisoft's insider program uh you may be able to get a chance to play an early

673
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:39,660
version of the game uh Riders Republic is getting a season four update called Freestyling that

674
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:46,380
they're going to have um some skate parks and whatnot to actually be able to uh play in and

675
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:54,700
I think they're also adding BMX to that as well and I think that was oh um Netflix uh they're

676
01:05:54,700 --> 01:06:00,700
going to be teaming up with them for a few different things I think Ubisoft related

677
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:08,060
I want to say they have an Assassin's Creed um game and tv show I'm not really sure what that's

678
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:15,260
about um Mighty Quest and Valiant Hearts 2 are I think mobile games that are going to be part of

679
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:23,180
Netflix's like gaming servicing that no one really cares about um Mythic Quest season three had a

680
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:28,460
uh trailer for that I can't believe that's on season three so that's I think still on Apple TV

681
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:38,380
um they talked about a free trial for Ubisoft Plus which is like a game pass on PC thing for

682
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:42,940
Ubisoft titles that's going to be um they're going to have a trail for that starting I think now it

683
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:49,420
runs until October 10th uh Trackmania a new version of that game is coming out supposed to

684
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:53,980
be free to play with no micro transactions so I'm not sure how they're making their money there

685
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:57,500
but there's going to be two premium tiers as well that you can buy into and they said the

686
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:04,460
seasonal updates every three months and that's supposed to be on all the modern consoles as well

687
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:11,660
uh Rocksmith Plus is like a I'm not sure if that's still going to be the similar I don't think

688
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:16,620
still have the accessories that go along with that but maybe a service that you can still learn how

689
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:20,860
to play the guitar and whatnot which is kind of cool uh new Just Dance game because of course

690
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:29,580
um and then a whole lot of Assassin's Creed whole lot Assassin's Creed so Assassin's Creed Mirage

691
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:38,300
which is the next big mainline game uh which is going to take place in um was it 9th century

692
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:45,100
Baghdad uh looks kind of cool they have an Assassin's Creed documentary talking about

693
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:49,340
the development of the game Assassin's Creed Valhalla is getting a last chapter for free

694
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:56,540
Assassin's Creed Codename Jade is going to be a mobile game that takes place in China in uh

695
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:04,060
215 BCE uh Assassin's Creed the the Netflix show we talked about a second ago they're

696
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:11,260
um not really sure what that's still going to be about but they're going to have a TV show as well

697
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:17,180
uh there is Assassin's Creed Codename Red which is supposed to take place in feudal Japan

698
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:23,660
Assassin's Creed Codename Hex which sort of has looks like the Blair Witch or something

699
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:28,460
something that has to do with witchcraft um and Assassin's Creed Infinity which is supposed to

700
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:34,060
somehow tie all this crap together this is what it sounds like when you're milking a franchise to

701
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:40,780
death so somebody has somebody has some lights to keep on over there good luck Ubisoft with that

702
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:49,180
Jesus Christ like um and then of course along with another franchise uh The Division so Tom Clancy's

703
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:58,380
The Division 2 um they're going to be doing like a new uh PvE mode and some other progression stuff

704
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:04,140
uh they said that there's supposed to be a season 10 with some quality life updates and

705
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,100
new difficulty modes and then season 11 is supposed to continue with the main story

706
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:16,620
uh Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland which is going to take place in middle America uh

707
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:26,220
there's also this Division Resurgence which is a mobile game uh that's going to be coming out

708
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:31,980
then Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Mobile also getting um you know obviously it's a mobile game as well

709
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:39,740
what else uh well we have some thoughts from chat uh Sia Tabiri says can I get an Assassin's Creed

710
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:45,180
that's set in the Edwardian area era excuse me and I'm actually just making clothes the entire time

711
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:54,380
don't encourage these people on further spin-offs because you joke but you know what why not a

712
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:59,500
farming sim set in the Assassin's Creed universe it's it's a cool new thing to do right now so

713
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:06,060
why not why not add clothes into that too Assassin's Creed My Little Cottage why not

714
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:11,580
you're also getting Assassin's Creed Symphonic Adventure which is a live concert

715
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:20,940
uh a podcast and a figurine who needs who needs a new podcast who needs any of those

716
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:28,940
I don't know like is there like I get it Assassin's Creed's a good it like I'm just

717
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:33,100
picturing for a second like if this was like Grand Theft Auto like if these were all like

718
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:37,420
Grand Theft Auto games that are being announced I would think that that's even too much like I'd be

719
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:42,380
like hold on like what the hell some of these sound cool like the Codename Red thing looks

720
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:46,220
cool but like that should be the game of the year you can't have like four four Assassin's

721
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:50,380
Creed games coming out at the same time like that is just ridiculous and I know these are

722
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:56,300
not all coming out the same time but like you know I don't need to know the 10 year

723
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:00,620
this is not the Marvel Cinematic Universe I don't need to know like the 10 mainline games

724
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:07,820
you have coming out for this series like just make a good game let's focus on the fruit in

725
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:13,740
the next game make it a good game please um going to an earlier comment in chat from I hope I don't

726
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:18,860
butcher this name Jess seven x uh in chat says will Beyond Good and Evil 2 ever come out

727
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:25,980
well you know it wasn't part of this so probably not you know what Dead Island 2 is apparently

728
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:30,380
finally happening so anything's possible um it ain't happening until it's actually out so

729
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:35,180
what's probably happening is that the fucking thing's getting delayed so much now they have

730
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:39,420
to re-scope it for a new console think about it when that game was first announced it was probably

731
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:46,940
being targeted for playstation 3 xbox 360 we're now on the playstation 5 and the xbox series x

732
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:51,580
like they're probably having to target that or maybe even beyond that at this point so it's

733
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:56,860
you know that that's probably what keeps pushing the thing back if you miss your target you can

734
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:03,340
really really miss your target and now you have to re-scope everything so so yeah but it's it's uh

735
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:07,660
I mean we haven't heard it's gotten cancelled but it could be one of those things where they're

736
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:11,980
basically gonna have to scrap it and start all over uh something more akin to what happened

737
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:20,220
with like final fantasy 15 duke nukem forever so you know let's see uh going to yeah quest buster

738
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:26,300
in chat says even as a ac I keep thinking animal crossing when I say ac which is funny but even as

739
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:32,540
an assassin's creed fan this seems like a lot of assassin's creed yes uh I guess the continues

740
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:37,980
quest buster I guess the uh ac version taking place in japan sounds cool right now but I'm

741
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:42,300
still thinking about ghost of Tsushima and how much more excited I am for an eventual sequel to

742
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:50,220
that uh ssho100 matt says eaves did an interview uh the ceo of ubisoft who you know we hate uh

743
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,660
where he basically strained himself patting himself on the back about the response of the

744
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:58,860
abuse scandal actual ubisoft employees are saying otherwise about said response actually happening

745
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:05,500
lift up those voices to make sure they catch the attention of the media and don't

746
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:11,340
let eaves gilmont drive that dialogue because that's exactly what he's trying to do with his

747
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:17,020
statements to the contrary so I hope uh the media will continue to report on what the workers are

748
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:22,940
actually saying about what's actually happening on that front which is not enough so uh eaves

749
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:28,060
gilmont probably needs to be removed as ceo already and if these 500 assassin's creed games

750
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:32,780
don't sell maybe that might finally happen although I somehow still still seem to doubt it

751
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:38,380
with um you know the amount of the stakeholder they have and all of that right pretty much yeah

752
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:45,580
yeah I can't imagine that'll happen all right um moving on to our next story uh it turns out that

753
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:53,260
facebook gaming is going to be losing their apps now I want to point out this doesn't mean that

754
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:59,580
it's been announced that facebook gaming is going away but this is how mixer started

755
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:06,620
the the beginning of the end basically um so facebook has sent out notifications to

756
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:11,900
partners that the apps will be shutting down in october and I guess one could argue youtube

757
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:17,180
gaming has also already done something similar and youtube gaming still has a presence so

758
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:25,180
it doesn't necessarily mean the end but it should be noted that facebook gaming has not really found

759
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:30,300
meaningful growth uh in game streaming the same way that um twitch and youtube have found those

760
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:39,260
things uh so yeah uh facebook gaming of course is run by meta uh they expanded even to irl streams

761
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:45,820
things like you know chatting art creation excel esports whatever uh they've got it on there uh

762
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:52,220
during the pandemic things like youtube and twitch have really gone up but facebook hasn't so much in

763
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:58,380
fact even facebook as a platform itself has seen declines in monthly active users earlier this year

764
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:07,020
and 20 of its share price uh was lost as a result so hmm so facebook gaming notified partners it is

765
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:13,260
going to be uh ending the mobile game streaming apps uh it is saying that they are continuing to

766
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:18,780
support game streaming within facebook itself but that doesn't mean that it's going to be something

767
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:23,420
they're going to continue to focus on or put a lot of money into and you might know that they've

768
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:30,140
put a lot of money into trying to get uh big talent over at um facebook gaming so

769
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:36,460
yeah it looks like it looks like it might be the beginning of the end for facebook gaming oh and

770
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:41,900
what's this in the article it looks like uh uh when reached out for comment uh rob roberts

771
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:47,020
from orange lounge radio the longest running podcast had the following to say about it

772
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:55,580
nah

773
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,580
i'm only petty sometimes

774
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:17,980
move but let's be real i hated the fact that facebook was getting into this space

775
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:21,980
i never liked them being in it and quite frankly i can't wait for them to get out

776
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:29,740
so sorry to my friends that use that platform to stream on stream on i don't want to say i told you

777
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:30,060
sell

778
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:39,340
have they tried like uh hot tub streams you know because i hear that this needs to be popular

779
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:51,420
low-key all right uh let's move on to uh our next story low-key uh this is funny this is a a

780
01:16:51,420 --> 01:17:02,220
response um or the the playstation boss apparently calls out microsoft over um you know the inadequate

781
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:08,940
call of duty deal they're saying so you may remember that microsoft has committed that

782
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:14,380
call of duty is still going to be on the playstation platforms for now um at least you

783
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:23,420
know for at least several more years um but they're saying that um he basically said i

784
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:27,900
hadn't intended to comment on what i understand to be private business discussion but i feel

785
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:32,060
i need to set the record straight because phil spencer brought this into a public forum

786
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:37,660
throwing shade already um microsoft has only offered call of duty to remain on playstation

787
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:43,660
for three years after the current agreement between activision and sony ends after uh almost

788
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:48,220
20 years of call of duty on playstation their proposal was inadequate on many levels

789
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:55,180
and failed to take an account of the impact on our gamers we want to guarantee playstation gamers

790
01:17:55,180 --> 01:18:00,060
continue to have the highest quality quality experience and microsoft's proposal undermines

791
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:09,420
this principle says the company or wasn't it sony or maybe i'm thinking maybe it was microsoft

792
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:15,820
somebody had like the tomb raider exclusive rights or would they do these timed things all the time

793
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:22,220
so that's like pot con that's the pot calling the kettle black at this point like microsoft sorry

794
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:26,940
like i don't microsoft had rise of the tomb raider for a year yeah yeah exactly but sony still has

795
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:33,340
final fantasy 7 remake exclusive exactly we haven't nailed that exactly and so and they've

796
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:40,860
had other exclusives before that as well um honestly like be glad they gave you three years dude

797
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:47,660
seriously like be glad they gave me look on one hand sony is just doing what they have to do from

798
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:53,260
a business sense like it right it would not be good business for them not to take a swing at it

799
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:58,300
you know however they feel the need to do it it doesn't make them right but i understand why they

800
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:03,740
have to say this stuff because you know legally it would they they are in the business of making

801
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:09,980
money and for them to roll over and you know have this franchise potentially leave them even in four

802
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:15,820
years with as much money as it makes is a big deal yeah it's what here's how it's gonna go down i

803
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:23,180
think is they'll keep it cross-platform for now on sony's platform until the playstation 6 whatever

804
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:28,300
the next xbox console gets announced and we're talking about new console launching and it's like

805
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:32,300
oh hey well if you won't play call of duty you got to come to this console now yeah that's how

806
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:37,500
it's going to go because um right now it is in their best interest to keep it multi-platform

807
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:42,060
because they're going to make a ton of money off of those users but later on when they were trying

808
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:47,980
to sway people to buy into an xbox console that's how you do it leverage with this stuff and i'm

809
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:51,340
sorry but like you can cry all about you want but you're doing the same thing so

810
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:59,020
i don't know whatever um sj100 matt chat says serious question if sony made this deal with abk

811
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:04,460
instead of microsoft would sony be as generous with microsoft or as this or would they pull it

812
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:08,220
from anything that's not pc or sony consoles they would have pulled it immediately you'll have a

813
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:15,980
chance to find out whenever destiny 3 happens so you know sony sony's been buying their own

814
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:22,220
companies lately too uh so you'll have a chance to find out if rumors are to be believed sony

815
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:25,980
will own square enix eventually i don't know how i don't know how much i believe that one but you

816
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:32,220
know anything is possible at this point so uh bobby blackwolf says sony will say we're not

817
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:36,220
doing the same thing with the top selling games in this country as what bobby says in chat so

818
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:43,740
yeah all right meanwhile anybody that's interested in playing any of these games

819
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:50,700
pc man you get sony games you get microsoft games you got everything yeah i mean i love

820
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:56,060
consoles still i do but you know there's lots of great if you but pc you just have to make sure

821
01:20:56,060 --> 01:21:00,860
you have the the pc that can handle these newer games and that's not really in the realm of

822
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:04,780
affordability for a lot of people so there's definitely still a place for consoles for sure

823
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:11,340
um before i get into the next story i wanted to mention this comment on the last story about uh

824
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:17,580
facebook uh from uh sj100 matt who said uh zuckerberg uh couldn't be reached for comment

825
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:25,740
he was in his awkward metaverse that was that i don't how is any how is anybody supposed to

826
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:30,860
believe that the metaverse is the next big thing with those like it looks like something that

827
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:35,660
would have been at least clarified that that was an early screenshot and then they have better

828
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:40,460
stuff but like yeah it doesn't matter though because it's just uninteresting i don't care

829
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:45,740
if it's like super photorealistic it's still boring like it doesn't matter like what are you

830
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:51,660
doing with it like how how does this revolutionize anything other than it being a chat room that you

831
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:57,180
do unnecessary like you want me to go work there too yeah like no uh when pushed for further

832
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:04,860
comments zuckerberg also said solo sucks anyway um let's see also uh in chat uh metaverse bobby

833
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:08,540
blackwolf there's like three people that'll get that joke bobby blackwolf says playstation home

834
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:13,580
looked better than that metaverse yes sj100 matt says second life looks better than that metaverse

835
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:19,900
yes that's a lot of the big problem with it that's for sure all right going to this last story sorry

836
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:24,540
i'm getting the comments out of order but i'm reading as fast as i can um she-hole 10 i thought

837
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:31,420
had a great perspective here saying call of duty will have to replace a broken halo series 343

838
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:36,700
studios dropped the ball on halo yeah you know i have been hearing a lot of not great stuff out

839
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:41,660
of halo like the whole like uh split screen mode ended up getting cancelled and just like

840
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:47,820
they're not but you can glitch it back into the game somehow yeah that the the the road map and

841
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:53,260
and the the direction that halo reach has been going not where they hope that would be that's

842
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:59,340
for sure so that is very interesting what she-hole brings up though is that maybe microsoft needs a

843
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:06,220
shooter to fill a gap that their current shooter is is not filling for people very interesting

844
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:15,180
so yeah all right anyhow uh let's move on and talk about more news uh we were talking about

845
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:19,660
conventions earlier in the show and there's another one uh that was scheduled to come up

846
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:25,260
in january it's awesome games done quick uh but it will no longer be happening in person it was

847
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:30,300
going to be happening in florida but they announced this week that uh games done quick

848
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:35,180
uh the 2023 awesome games done quick event will be online it's going to be virtual again

849
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:41,180
january 8th through the 15th but here's the interesting thing they already had one of these

850
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:48,220
in person so it isn't covid directly that's responsible for the reason why they're shifting

851
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:54,140
this online however there's a couple reasons why they're shifting this online uh the organizers

852
01:23:54,140 --> 01:24:00,380
want to return in person but in order to quote provide a safe and welcoming event to all they

853
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:05,420
need to move away from their plan location in florida in the statement they said given the

854
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:13,900
state's continued disregard for covid 19's dangers including anti-mandate policies and an increased

855
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:20,380
aggression towards lgbtq individuals including the law colloquially known as don't say gay

856
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:27,260
we do not believe it is a safe place for our community that is taking quite a stand on both

857
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:33,260
those fronts uh we know that florida has not exactly been the most covid precaution

858
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:41,660
encouraging state while i believe they could have a mask mandate in florida still on private

859
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:45,900
property at the hotel if the hotel and the convention could reach that agreement like

860
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:50,940
they did in minnesota for that event they just had over the summer i believe they cannot per

861
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:57,180
florida law mandate vaccination and i noticed they didn't call out masks in what they said they said

862
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:04,060
anti-mandate policies so they can't mandate that everybody has to be vaccinated and therefore

863
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:10,140
they're not willing to put people at risk so that's you know what it's it's about time florida

864
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:14,860
paid a price for some of these things that they keep you know it just sucks that it's a charity

865
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:19,660
event but the charity is still going to make money in the online form the charity i don't think will

866
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:24,380
lose anything out of this and you know we're going to get more speed runs submitted from around the

867
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:28,140
world because more people will be able to participate more people will be able to participate

868
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:32,620
virtually so i think that end of it in fact even when they did do it in person it was kind of cool

869
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:36,700
that they still had some stuff that was virtual so they could really get the best of both worlds

870
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:41,980
i think that's the that's the um marathon a lot of us would like to see because in person you get

871
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:46,860
the in-person reactions the in-person memes like there's a lot of guys i'm not saying it should

872
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:53,260
always be online i i love having a little bit of both but i i have to applaud games done quick for

873
01:25:53,260 --> 01:26:00,620
taking a stand and even though they they really try not to be politically uh you know motivated

874
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:04,060
or whatever because you know people have their opinions all over the spectrum and what have you

875
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:10,060
the reality is lgbtq people there's a lot of them that volunteer and work with games done quick

876
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:17,100
and florida doesn't really feel like a safe space for folks right now so i understand why they did

877
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:23,900
it um so i mean the charity will still have it will still make money the event will still happen

878
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:28,380
it'll be online we'll miss the live reaction stuff and so forth but this is what they had to do to get

879
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:33,500
out of the car actually they can't get out of the contract but it's it's it's the easiest way to

880
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:38,220
remedy the situation we'll leave it at that right and it should be fine like it was fine the years

881
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:42,860
that they had to do it online anyways it wasn't like it was a worse event it was just different

882
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:49,340
so yep that is uh gonna be in january of 2022 bobby and chad is pointing out they are risking

883
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:54,540
bankruptcy by doing this um good point because even though it is a charity organization

884
01:26:54,540 --> 01:27:01,260
um they are still an organization that has an income and an out outgoing funds and all that

885
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:06,940
stuff because um they you know they run their channel throughout the year that isn't necessarily

886
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:11,100
a charity fundraiser it helps them fund these different events and so forth so it's going to

887
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:16,300
different events and so forth so it is a company that puts on charity events there's kind of a

888
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:22,060
different sort of thing to it so they they could go bankrupt from this whole thing um

889
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:31,660
but i i i think it would be a really ugly look if the hotel sues this organization into oblivion

890
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:37,100
i i i'm you know it it is what it is we'll see what happens i realize business isn't always

891
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:43,740
nice or about the right thing um so we'll see what happens i wonder if and i bobby i have no

892
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:48,540
idea if you know this or not are they still sending a because i know when they when they

893
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:57,260
still do the virtual ones they send a skeleton crew to the site as basically the base of operations

894
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:04,540
so technically aren't they still for seeing their contract through by sending people to that hotel

895
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:08,540
as the base of operation of course i'm assuming they're still doing that maybe they're not even

896
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:13,580
going to do that because of the uh uh oh they do it from the virginia office says bobby they don't

897
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:17,260
go to the site they do it out of virginia all right then that answers that i thought they went

898
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:25,740
to the hotel and still did it there all right then all right uh let's move on with some more

899
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:31,740
stories loki what do you have for us yes so apparently twitch is permanently removing its

900
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:39,660
host mode on october 3rd um so apparently the hosting command and auto host features

901
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:49,260
will be gone which is really stupid um i don't yeah i'm not a fan they announced their change

902
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:55,820
in an update to their how to host or how to use host mode page uh saying that the experience

903
01:28:55,820 --> 01:29:03,980
it delivers doesn't match their expectations when they come to twitch i i don't understand why you

904
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:09,900
would remove it like i don't see what the gain is i'm doing that i understand that there is confusion

905
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:15,900
between hosting and rating and that whole thing and it causes a little bit of like you know

906
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:20,860
confusion issues for especially for a newer streamer what do i do what's better and so forth

907
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:26,300
but um i think one of the big problems on twitch that everybody complains about

908
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:31,820
is discoverability and what's very interesting especially you know having sat on a few panels and

909
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:36,460
heard a lot of perspectives from this on the digital media track at dragon con this last week

910
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:41,340
it sounds like a platform that does discoverability very well is actually tik tok and i even think

911
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:46,220
about my own experiences with tik tok where i posted a random video that wasn't even funny

912
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:52,300
i have something like 750 views with no promotion so the discoverability on uh algorithm on tik tok

913
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:58,140
is pretty darn good the discoverability on twitch not the greatest usually the people that are on

914
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:03,340
the front page are already partners and it ends up being a rich get richer type of situation

915
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:12,460
so where hosting was good was that if i'm not live i could promote a channel in my place

916
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:17,260
basically on the main page in a little place that says hosting or you know channels being

917
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:22,780
hosted right now and something to keep in mind that i think even twitch forget sometimes is

918
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:28,940
there's a lot of us who still watch on playstation on xbox and so forth and there's a whole little

919
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:34,460
bar that shows the channels that are being hosted right now and i do look through that when none of

920
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:39,100
my friends are live or honestly none of my friends are playing anything i really want to see i'll go

921
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:43,580
look through the hosting and see well what's being hosted that might be interesting to look at

922
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:49,100
so i think where this is frustrating people is that they're taking discoverability away that's

923
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:53,900
what's happening and although twitch tries to say that well rating can take its place and so forth

924
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:58,940
i disagree because rating isn't something that's always there like for instance for us here at vog

925
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:03,980
network we used to say at the end of the show hey put us on your auto host list because there's a lot

926
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:09,580
of you that probably aren't live sunday night but by hosting us then we'll show up as a recommended

927
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:15,340
thing on your friends pages as something to check out that's why hosting is great rating doesn't do

928
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:21,900
any of that so there is a clear difference between those two things rating is a one-time thing hosting

929
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:25,180
is something that was kind of always there so i think that's why it's very frustrating that we're

930
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:31,020
losing it now if twitch were to turn around and say here's some discoverability we're going to

931
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:36,620
put in its place i think it would soften the blow a lot better yeah what they're discovered with

932
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:43,740
their um their suggestions are just give them a shout out to help them gain some followers send

933
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:49,500
your viewers to their channel at the end of your stream suggest channels for viewers to um to

934
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:57,980
viewers when you're offline yeah like that was we could already do that it's just i don't know um

935
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:04,940
yeah no i i agree now if only twitch had something very large planned for about the time that this

936
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:10,460
feature is sun setting to announce something new to enhance discoverability for our friends

937
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:15,500
if only they had a large convention with a keynote speech where they could announce something that

938
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:21,660
could really soften this blow a bit fingers and toes crossed well they said they're they're

939
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:25,980
reasoning for it they said that uh what viewers want to interact with the streamer when they're

940
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:31,020
live and host mode blocks us from happening preventing viewers from interacting with the

941
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:36,780
streamer they are watching also limits the streamer's growth potential um okay well then

942
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:42,780
don't do that like make it so that it auto like it kind of think of it instead of an auto host

943
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:49,500
it's a forwarder types of things you know what's it you know and it's like i do agree with you

944
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:54,220
loki but you know what's interesting i've got an interesting use case for you for why it should be

945
01:32:54,220 --> 01:33:00,220
separate sometimes and that is what we do here at vog network for large events and we're going

946
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:05,820
to lose this because of this so for example when a microsoft keynote is going on if we're having

947
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:13,020
to work or something and bobby and myself or you jamie whoever is unavailable to do a simulcast

948
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:19,820
which we could still do we would usually host it and have our own chat that is a lot less

949
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:24,620
shit posted than the large chat that's happening during a microsoft or playstation event it's

950
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:31,020
just us in a chat watching the same event we could really benefit from that and many people

951
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:35,980
in chat are referencing that right now although bobby is also stating the reality i could honestly

952
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:40,700
count on one hand how many people participated yes that is the honest you know truth there

953
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:47,260
and we can still simulcast them as our schedules permit you know we so it says that the auto host

954
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:52,380
will be changed to suggested channels in your channel settings i don't know what that necessarily

955
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:56,700
means well i'll be curious to see what that looks like and how that might help lead to discovery

956
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:01,500
because maybe that won't be as bad as we think so we'll see we'll have to see what that looks like

957
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:09,820
in practice so yeah all right um let's move on we're going to uh go to a classic segment that

958
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:15,100
we do here on this show even though dark sakura is not here tonight we always have a plan b so

959
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:30,700
let's get to our next segment and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive

960
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:36,780
into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of

961
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:42,860
the week all right and dark soccer is not here tonight so i'm doing this segment instead tonight

962
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:50,060
but i did pull a page out of dark sakura's book and i picked a game that is 10 years old in this

963
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:57,100
last month and this is one you're probably going to be surprised rock band blitz is the classic

964
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:05,260
game of the week which was originally released on the playstation 3 august 28 2012 or on the xbox

965
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:12,620
360 august 29th of 2012 that's right this game just barely qualifies that it as it just turned

966
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:16,620
10 years old a couple of weeks ago and usually that's where we draw the line is that a classic

967
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:21,900
game of the week needs to be about 10 years old and mike defton chat over at uh twitch.tv slash

968
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:26,700
vlog network says i miss this game me too when i saw that this was on the lit because you know i

969
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:30,700
went over and i was like what games you know turned 10 recently and i saw this and i was like

970
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:37,420
no way not this game i loved this game in some ways i like this game even more than the rock band

971
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:40,940
games because you didn't need the plastic instruments to play it let's talk a little bit

972
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:45,420
about rock band blitz those of you that are watching live can see the footage here those

973
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:50,060
of you on the podcast i'll tell you a little bit about it and uh uh what we're seeing on the screen

974
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:55,420
here so this was a game that was released by harmonix in 2012 as i mentioned it was only an

975
01:35:55,420 --> 01:36:00,300
online title so it was not something you could get retail uh it did not come with plastic instruments

976
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:05,820
it was meant to be played with a controller uh the gameplay mechanics were similar to other

977
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:12,140
harmonix titles that had been released prior including frequency amplitude and rock band

978
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:18,220
unplugged which i believe was the vita no the psp i think that one was on uh 25 songs came with

979
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:26,620
the game and the big clincher with this songs from any other version of the game that were exported or

980
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:31,660
downloaded as dlc or anything like that you could use all of it so that was what made this

981
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:38,060
game awesome is that you probably had thanks to rock band you had a library of tons of songs

982
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:45,180
all ready to go with this but here's the bummer about this game and i'm not sure somebody who

983
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:51,740
follows the wiki or either dark soccer herself may know better i don't know if we've had a game that

984
01:36:51,740 --> 01:37:01,420
we've spotlit that you can literally no longer play today i mean i guess well i say that but

985
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:06,780
if you have it on your 360 now nobody uninstalled it through 360 but if you've never played this

986
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:14,300
game before there's no way for you to get it it was delisted on august 28th 2017 so five years ago

987
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:18,460
it was removed so on the five-year anniversary the game was removed and that was due to the music

988
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:23,100
license expirations so we have an interesting classic game where it's like if you don't have

989
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:27,660
this game there is no way for you to get it you're gonna have to find a friend that still

990
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:36,300
has it on their 360 or playstation um or um uh something else oh dark soccer suggests pt

991
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:40,220
she may have done at some point and that would be in a similar boat oh yeah i guess i guess

992
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:46,140
that is a very similar boat where it was also delisted so there is that so anyway uh rock band

993
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:52,380
blitz it's a note matching rhythm game again it's very similar designed a frequency amplitude rock

994
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:59,180
band unplugged you have five lanes that match lead guitar bass guitar drums vocals and keyboard

995
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:04,380
and they go through the different streets oh thanks orange right pt isn't 10 years old so

996
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:11,660
it couldn't have been done yet it's getting close though all right anyway um and uh there's only a

997
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:15,820
single difficulty level i think that's interesting because the rock band games had different uh

998
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:20,700
difficulty levels within the songs uh you can customize the controls but you use the buttons

999
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:26,380
on the gamepad to basically hop between different lanes and you score points for each note that you

1000
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:31,420
get and once you get enough points in a lane you basically capture the lane and that lane auto

1001
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:37,900
plays for a portion of the song uh when you build a blitz meter you move faster along the tracks

1002
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:43,980
until you miss a few notes and you get a scoring bonus during that time once you complete a song

1003
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:49,740
you are rated on a scale of one to five stars which is reflected of your total scores and

1004
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:56,860
you're given both cred which unlocks power-ups and it reflects on your long-term performance

1005
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:04,380
you get overdrive power-ups from the cred as you get white notes it fills the overdrive meter

1006
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:09,660
you can then activate the overdrive power-up which is a two times scoring multiplier or you

1007
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:14,860
can have the computer play one note for one track for you for a period of time or you can do a

1008
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:21,020
bottle rocket which sends out a shock wave uh i guess an out of control car goes through the track

1009
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:27,500
and it scores points for all the notes that are hit you also have note-based uh power-ups uh

1010
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:34,460
where certain notes are marked purple and uh while you hit the notes uh you do the effects of that

1011
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:41,180
power-up for example you can explode all notes on nearby tracks for points you can create a pinball

1012
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:47,420
that while it hits different notes and you keep it in play it will score points that's pretty cool

1013
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:52,460
and a sprite that moves between tracks that you try to catch to earn points and then lastly there

1014
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:56,460
are track-based power-ups uh they're either active on different tracks during the song

1015
01:39:56,460 --> 01:40:01,340
that double the point values of a particular track or it's activated when you switch a track

1016
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:06,140
or whatever so there's all these different things to do it also there was a facebook application for

1017
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:10,620
this rock band world that could actually track online scoreboards so that way you can compete

1018
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:15,420
with friends even between xbox and playstation platforms you also because it's all about the

1019
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:21,660
sales would get recommended dlc uh through uh what your friends are playing and so forth so

1020
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:28,940
the development of this game it was a departure from past rock band titles project director

1021
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:33,900
matthew nordhaus referred to it as saying instead of having the focus on musical authenticity and

1022
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:39,180
a performance simulation this is an arcade game it's fast loud silly and a little over the top

1023
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:47,980
the game was originally called synchrony but then they changed it to rock band blitz uh and because

1024
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:52,460
one of the power-ups was called the blitz and that's i guess what they they got it from uh

1025
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:57,580
they did experiment with some other mechanics like having three notes per lane uh because i

1026
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:02,540
believe there's only two in what was originally or what ended up being set up uh could you use

1027
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:08,220
analog controls for vocal tracks uh and so forth so but they they kind of threw these out we got

1028
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:14,300
we got what we got um they did experiment with instrument controls but ultimately found there

1029
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:19,340
was no easy way to include them in the title and they realized this was going to be a single player

1030
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:23,980
game but this is why they went to social elements like the facebook platform to kind of get that

1031
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:29,740
simulation of playing and challenging other people uh they launched blitz with the rock

1032
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:35,500
band world facebook application and then again it allowed you to compare your progress and so forth

1033
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:41,020
so uh the game was originally premiered at the 2012 penny arcade expo east convention

1034
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:45,420
uh i think that was one that i went to actually and it was shown to members of the press during

1035
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:51,340
the game developers conference in 2012 uh at the end harmonix did say they would remove blitz from

1036
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:56,540
playstation and xbox live due to the expiration of music licensing agreements uh they do not have

1037
01:41:56,540 --> 01:42:00,700
plans to make the games backwards compatible again probably because of those same licensing

1038
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:06,620
issues and this game is not backwards compatible on either xbox or playstation platform at this

1039
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:14,220
time and i don't know if it ever will be uh due to the music issues so um i would go over the list

1040
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:19,820
but there's a lot a lot of songs in the list here so i'll just call out a few favorites you know i

1041
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:24,780
love me some kelly clarkson so stronger was one of the songs that was in the game raise your glass

1042
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:31,580
by pink moves like jagger which was all over the radio uh by maroon 5 uh was was in the game as

1043
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:36,700
well and how about a queen song because we love queens so death on two legs uh was in the game

1044
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:42,060
as well but that's just really just a small portion of the list uh rock band blitz got

1045
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:48,140
generally a positive reception including a 77 on metacritic and a 76.9 on game rankings if you uh

1046
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:54,140
care about that sort of stuff uh it was praised for the core gameplay and the leaderboards but

1047
01:42:54,140 --> 01:43:00,220
there was a criticism that it didn't really draw solo players uh that if you're not into high

1048
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:05,580
scores there wasn't as much of a reason to do it uh it was called out that social hooks could have

1049
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:10,620
been better implemented uh but if you have a large library of rock band tracks hey you're gonna have

1050
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:16,220
a lot here for you so um that's pretty much all i have to say about it i spent a lot of hours on

1051
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:20,540
this game i really like this game i think it really stinks that we don't have a backwards

1052
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:24,940
compatible version of this game i wish they would release just the player for those of us that still

1053
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:29,580
have a large library of rock band tracks maybe take out the music i understand why it's one of

1054
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:34,220
those things that's easier said than done i just you know i thought this game was great and i

1055
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:39,020
really would love to see harmonix visited again sometime even if i didn't love the amplitude

1056
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:43,900
reboot that came after this but that's another story so there it is your classic game of the

1057
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:51,500
week rock band blitz did you ever play rock band blitz loki uh i did when it first came out yeah

1058
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:57,820
not very much yeah um i think i just downloaded because uh you know i played my full library of

1059
01:43:57,820 --> 01:44:03,900
rock band songs and i had a ton of songs so it made sense yeah um was it the opposite too because

1060
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:07,900
i know like with a lot of those games you can kind of move them between different games like i know

1061
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:12,860
with like rock band 2 you can import like yeah lego rock band and stuff like that all those songs

1062
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:18,540
and mike def points out you could also export the rock band blitz songs and play them in the real

1063
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:22,220
real rock band you know the main line i guess or whatever franchise that's what that's what

1064
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:27,580
was worth it for a lot of those like i remember was it um i think it was like a rock band that had

1065
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:32,940
uh like i had the tiger or something like that there was like one of those like i oh i got to

1066
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:38,060
get those songs it was like lego lego rock band had a yeah yeah yeah so like it was it was worth

1067
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:42,460
like just purchasing the game because i think it was like super cheap at one point just to get the

1068
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:47,180
licensed songs so you can pull them in like regular rock bands so that's pretty cool all

1069
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:53,340
right um we really just have a few more stories for you um i know that might seem kind of like

1070
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:58,700
a surprise but um a there wasn't quite as much gaming news this week with the labor day holiday

1071
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:03,900
and you know everything else going on and b i knew i probably wasn't gonna last a full three

1072
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:08,140
hours tonight so we don't have quite as many stories slotted tonight um but i will encourage

yeah like what i um i played uh some dead by daylight um not i didn't stream it except for

1085
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:26,220
a couple of days i did and i regretted it because i lost my voice but um i played with uh nick and

1086
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:34,860
a couple of times and uh played with gwen as finora and you took my place on a stream the

1087
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:41,180
other night well i didn't realize that you were already playing when i reached out before so

1088
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:48,060
yeah no it's and it's it's fine because i i i could i really i i wasn't quite over covid so

1089
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:52,860
i was really and i'm still not really but like it was one of those i could maybe do this for like 90

1090
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:57,100
minutes and then dinner was coming in anyway so it was like all right i'm leaving and then

1091
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:00,700
i left to go eat dinner when i came back i was like oh jamie took my place that's cute i love

1092
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:06,620
that so but it looks like you guys had fun i also had wanted to play with uh tay and black's again

1093
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:11,660
for a while oh yeah there's there's so much fun i love that group they are they are a trip to both

1094
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:17,500
of them yeah and they were increasingly drunk by the end of uh as is typical for friday night

1095
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:26,700
streams yeah right um but man though the state of dbd right now is stinkier and stinkier and

1096
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:34,860
stinkier and west career and west career well it's it's just like the camping has gotten worse

1097
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:45,500
oh yeah it sure has no buena yeah um and um but i mean as far as like i still have a lot of fun

1098
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:51,980
but i have i'm waiting until rank reset to try wesker because i adopted ada and uh rebecca first

1099
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:59,340
day um i'm actually playing i played shiva today because she still had like uh like a couple of

1100
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:05,340
cakes and uh some stuff on her on well it's from it's from playing claire it's and she's quiet it's

1101
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:10,860
the it's i swear that this game right now is just resident evil meets dead by daylight like it's

1102
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:17,820
all resident evil which is but everybody like shiva everybody from resident evil is so hot

1103
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:27,020
i'm gonna go on record though and say i don't think carlos looks good his hair is a hot mess

1104
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:32,540
i don't know i kind of like a guy with messy hair well no i'm not saying it's messy i'm saying it's

1105
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:39,180
poorly rendered the same thing with all of the attack on titan most of the attack on titan hairs

1106
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:46,860
and also most of yui's my like her new ones my imagination fills in the uh

1107
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:56,780
imperfections my brain goes into design nerd stuff so um but uh but at any rate um i have

1108
01:48:56,780 --> 01:49:01,100
been playing cult of the lamb uh that's like my monday thing and of course that'll be a

1109
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:07,100
a silent stream for me because i am i have been on an almost vow of silence

1110

start with loki yep so uh this is kind of cool and uh basically you may remember there's been

1124
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:43,500
a few games that they've done this where they've reverse engineered hobbyists have reverse

1125
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:49,180
engineered a certain nintendo games not even necessarily just nintendo um because i remember

1126
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:53,980
they did that with the i think it was like vice city or something like that for playstation but

1127
01:50:53,980 --> 01:51:01,500
anyways um so now they have reverse engineered the uh legend of zelda link to the past and they

1128
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:09,660
have ported it to pc so it's running natively on pc now uh this is thanks to a github user snes rev

1129
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:16,380
who has uh put together the code to do that now of course you have to have a legally obtained

1130
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:25,500
version of the rom available and then using some uh python scripts you can convert it into an

1131
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:32,460
executable for the pc uh it runs all right right now they don't it's like running but they don't

1132
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:38,860
have like all of you know the fancy features like you know upscaling or uh full screen remappable

1133
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:44,860
controls and that type of stuff yet but you know it's being worked on until it gets shut down by

1134
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:52,700
nintendo so go download it while you can all right i have one quick story for you also out

1135
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:58,700
of the d23 expo and that is that a new tron game is coming and you know this caught my attention

1136
01:51:58,700 --> 01:52:04,460
right it is a game called tron identity but it might not be what you think because this game is

1137
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:09,420
apparently going to be more of a visual novel it's not going to feature anybody from the movies so

1138
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:13,500
it's just kind of set in the tron universe but i'm actually like totally okay with that i actually

1139
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:17,100
like that idea of trying to establish things that are independent from the movies because i

1140
01:52:17,660 --> 01:52:22,220
like the movies have been in development hell for you know we all have heard that there's that

1141
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:26,060
mysterious third movie they're talking about making that jared letto may or may not be involved

1142
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:35,100
with and i hope it's not um but regardless the the the tron um legacy was 2010 it's been 12 years

1143
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:38,540
since that movie so like if a sequel is going to happen you would hope it would happen sooner

1144
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:44,460
rather than later of course it took what 28 years the first time so oh so anyway i i like

1145
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:48,620
that disney is trying to establish some tron things that are outside of the movie universe

1146
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:53,260
so that maybe tron can continue and i'm still jazzed that they are opening a ride i think

1147
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:57,500
they showed test footage of the ride today uh i think they said it's going to be early next year

1148
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:05,500
i'd love to go to something like i was seeing uh because there's a few people on um on youtube that

1149
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:10,700
i follow that do like the park you know like the pov park ride stuff yeah someone was saying like

1150
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:16,300
the people movers are coming back because that's exciting news that is a huge rumor right now is

1151
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:21,100
that people movers are coming back yeah i hope so i love it yeah i would love to see that too

1152
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:27,980
but anyway uh tron identity is a game that is coming out um in 2023 and it is a visual novel

1153
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:32,940
and puzzle game it's being developed by mike befell who made thomas was alone so that's a

1154
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:38,220
pretty big resume item and the solitaire conspiracy uh in the game you will follow

1155
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:43,740
query a detective program that is keeping the peace on an all new grid query is tasked with

1156
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:51,020
unraveling a break-in and theft that occurred um you will advance the story by uh defragging other

1157
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:57,260
programs identity disk um so once you defrag the disk you get to the path that shows the solution

1158
01:53:57,260 --> 01:54:03,500
for the unique puzzles uh it should be noted uh this is and what's interesting this article i'm

1159
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:11,180
looking at says that tron is the first disney uh tron game for pc or console since tron 2.0

1160
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:17,660
that is incorrect uh in 2004 there was a tron runner game that came out and i think that was

1161
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:24,540
the name of it was tron run run are yeah so um how about that way to get way to do your job

1162
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:30,380
gaming journalist uh no i'm just giving him shit there was that tron run our game that was out i

1163
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:37,180
want to say that was around 20 it was a few years after the movie i want to say that 2015 2016

1164
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:43,980
so it's it's been a little bit but yeah uh also um this is completely neglecting

1165
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:52,780
the tron legacy uh xbox 360 and p um maybe that one wasn't on pc but i think it was

1166
01:54:53,580 --> 01:54:59,100
so they neglected that one too it was i think it was called just tron legacy but it was like

1167
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:05,580
a tie-in game that was on like the 360 and playstation 3 yeah that was more of a traditional

1168
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:11,820
adventure game so it's trying evolution try evolution thank you okay that's what it was

1169
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:18,700
so there have been other tron games just so you know all right uh that's it for our rapid

1170
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:23,820
fire news let's travel around the world and check out some release dates loki do me a solid

1171
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:29,100

1172
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:32,940

1173
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:40,540
talking about they just didn't research enough what uh anyways so we have quite a few things

1198
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:20,060
week in japan i think uh on the nintendo switch this week is dragon quest 10 offline so this was

1199
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:25,180
announced a little while ago where this is uh you know the version of dragon quest 10 uh where you

1200
01:59:25,180 --> 01:59:29,980
don't have to pay to do an mmo anymore um i hope i hope this gets localized for the us because we

1201
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:35,020
never got to play dragon quest 10 in any capacity so we'll see uh a regular and deluxe edition are

1202
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:40,140
bound for japan on the 15th uh we also have on the switch fairy fencer f refrain cord comes out

1203
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:47,180
trinity trigger is also out and uh that is it for the switch if we go over to the playstation 5

1204
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:51,580
uh dragon quest 10 offline is also released on the playstation on the playstation 5

1205
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:56,380
uh fairy fencer f and trinity trigger also so i guess those are your big games but there's one

1206
01:59:56,380 --> 02:00:03,340
more on the playstation 5 and that is japan's release of destroy all humans 2 the reprobed

1207
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:09,980
edition also in japan this week you can pick up a playstation 5 horizon forbidden west bundle uh

1208
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:17,660
that is out in a uh regular and uh the digital edition of ps5 so um that is the version of the

1209
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:24,140
that uh i guess just comes included with the game or so i guess the playstation itself doesn't look

1210
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:34,620
any different so okay yeah that's weird all right i'm trying to see if maybe there's like a subtle

1211
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:38,620
engraving or something on it because i when i saw it i assumed it was a limited release console but

1212
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:48,060
i guess not all righty then all right uh let's move on with a couple more stories loki yes so

1213
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:58,140
gamesop has been accused of wiretapping customers um and this is it's not as crazy as it sounds

1214
02:00:58,140 --> 02:01:05,580
so basically what it is they are not complying with the california's invasion of privacy act

1215
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:13,180
which they can't basically website operators can't create transcripts of visitors conversations and

1216
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:20,780
this is happening in their support chat is what's happening um they're saying that apparently the

1217
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:27,020
company is uh taking secret transcripts of those wiretaps and they're sharing them with

1218
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:31,100
a third party that helps them boost its ability to harvest personal data

1219
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:41,980
but anyways so they do have a lawsuit though um that's basically saying that you know that

1220
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:46,380
compliance with sipa is easy and the vast majority of companies comply with the law

1221
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:50,700
by simply notifying website visitors if their conversations are being recorded

1222
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:55,260
so you know how you you know hear those messages whenever you call an 800 number or something like

1223
02:01:55,260 --> 02:02:02,780
that that they're recorded for you know quality and training purposes which is which is you know

1224
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:08,460
because i did work in a call center for a very long time many years ago and they you know uh we

1225
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:13,260
would play the calls and training class absolutely that was something that we would do um to to learn

1226
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:19,900
from them and so forth um but also yeah calls get randomly audited that's how uh companies make sure

1227
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:23,500
because they i don't know how much i should say well i don't work there anymore and it's been a

1228
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:28,700
long time but but they they found out that um some of the people working were um hanging up on

1229
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:32,940
customers and they can only do that through the uh audit process so it's an important part to keep

1230
02:02:32,940 --> 02:02:37,900
the integrity of what's going on in this case they're saying that the uh that game stop is

1231
02:02:37,900 --> 02:02:44,380
allowing zendesk to intercept and use the transcripts from these well zendesk is apparently

1232
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:49,820
a like ticketing system so i don't know how malicious it is that they're doing that but

1233
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:54,700
at the very least they should probably be complying with the the sipa act um in order to

1234
02:02:55,820 --> 02:03:01,900
you know not getting hot water for this stuff but you know it seems benign to me it's not like a

1235
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:06,940
like oh we're capturing all this data and we're selling it to you know advertisers and we're gonna

1236
02:03:06,940 --> 02:03:14,300
figure it out no i think it's it seems a little litigious um but

1237
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:26,300
we'll see if anything comes of this i doubt it all right um let's move on into one more story for the

1238
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:34,140
night um and it's a sad one uh we lost uh a gaming great this last week i think this is

1239
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:40,460
actually the week we were out um but i'm gonna mention it anyway on august 30th uh the president

1240
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:47,580
of miracle kids uh mitsuhiro yoshida passed away suddenly uh although you may not be familiar with

1241
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:54,780
miracle kids with a z uh you would know mitsuhiro yoshida as uh one of the people uh that was on the

1242
02:03:54,780 --> 02:04:02,700
team at uh technos japan who created the series like river city ransom super dodgeball and nintendo

1243
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:08,060
world cup these were all part of the kunio kun series and i believe there's even a compilation

1244
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:14,140
of like kunio kun games that came out just within the past couple years miracle kids was made up

1245
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:19,260
largely of former staff there and they even continued to produce titles in the kunio kun

1246
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:25,420
series most of these are now owned by arc system works um so uh in a statement that was posted to

1247
02:04:25,420 --> 02:04:30,300
twitter uh mitsuhiro yoshida president of miracle kids and one of the key creative figures behind

1248
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:36,380
classic kunio kun titles including nes super dodgeball and river city ransom passed away on

1249
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:41,180
august 30th suddenly that's all they said was suddenly they didn't give any more details

1250
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:49,180
but still what a um what a terrible loss uh for the industry um unfortunately these stories of

1251
02:04:49,180 --> 02:04:55,340
loss do not end there i would need to say something as well about um a very well-known

1252
02:04:55,340 --> 02:05:00,780
video game journalist who also passed away while we were out um on this last week and that was mike

1253
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:06,380
fahey uh who is with kotaku oh wow and say which say what you oh you didn't hear about this no i

1254
02:05:06,380 --> 02:05:11,900
haven't heard about oh well you've been very busy paying attention to other things um no mike fahey

1255
02:05:11,900 --> 02:05:18,300
passed away um at 49 um he passed away on friday and uh you know he he was having some medical

1256
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:26,700
problems over the past couple years um so uh he uh had a aortic dissection in 2018 that is where

1257
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:31,820
the body kind of tear your main artery and it left him paralyzed and he was using a wheelchair

1258
02:05:31,820 --> 02:05:36,940
he had another one of these tears in april and a subsequent infection unfortunately was the cause

1259
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:43,100
of death so it's a very very tragic um say what you will about kotaku over the years um and we've

1260
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:48,860
said plenty um but uh mike fahey definitely seemed like he was always one of the good guys and um

1261
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:54,060
you know i i there's not a lot i i did not have a lot of interactions with him so i can't say a lot

1262
02:05:54,060 --> 02:06:00,940
however i know um our pal bobby blackwolf who we work with here at vog was also in the atlanta area

1263
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:06,540
where mike fahey was and has a lot more to say on his show this week and gives a much better tribute

1264
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:13,660
so i would encourage you to listen to that show but um obviously um you know gaming journalism

1265
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:20,140
of a certain area was absolutely in part shaped by mike fahey so that's a huge loss as well so

1266
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:24,940
um sjo and her matt wants to point out kotaku had a very nice write-up with stories from various

1267
02:06:24,940 --> 02:06:29,340
people in the industry uh yeah i just saw that yeah dartesia says yeah i didn't know him but

1268
02:06:29,340 --> 02:06:33,980
damn if i didn't see his articles on kotaku mike def says mike fahey was one of the few people at

1269
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:41,340
kotaku that was worth reading so um yeah so that's a very unfortunate uh loss as well in the industry

1270
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:48,220
this week so all right well with that i'm going to try to move into our listener roundtable and

1277
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:39,180
something called the uh the rob roberts diet it's kind of similar to you know to to the richard

simmons diet it's been kind of working it's been kind of helping you know oh actually so like more

02:07:49,820 --> 02:07:56,380
no it's good water's good and i i i love richard simmons i i take that as a an ultimate compliment

1281
02:07:56,380 --> 02:08:01,580
he's an amazing human being i could i could do an entire three hour talk on how richard simmons is

1282
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:05,660
completely underappreciated and a gift we don't deserve but anyway i'll save that for another day

1283
02:08:06,300 --> 02:08:09,260
what's on your mind you didn't call it to talk about richard simmons what do you want to talk

1284
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:13,980
about well things but before i continue i do want to say loki my deepest condolences

1285
02:08:14,700 --> 02:08:17,500
i i understand what you're going through and we got you bro

1286
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:24,220
thank you you're welcome uh secondly i i kind of want to

1287
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:32,620
tag along to something what bobby black was said about uh game zone quick let's say for for the

1288
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:40,060
sake of it they they sent like a skeleton team to that to the venue just just just for the sake of

1289
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:46,700
it now upon top of the fact that the company will have to pay cancellation fees from the venue

1290
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:52,460
there's additional fees for the rooms because when you sometimes when you get these venues you got to

1291
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:59,260
promise that you're going to fill x amount of rooms and if you don't fill them you basically

1292
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:07,900
paying like like maybe up to 100 to 150 per room a con that i was violent told that that happened

1293
02:09:07,900 --> 02:09:14,460
its first year and it was kind of surprising they were able to bounce back with a uh year two so

1294
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:21,420
that's i actually have known that from something else i'm working with on the side um that yeah

1295
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:26,540
they're yeah the room guarantees and all that to to get the rates and all that yep that is very

1296
02:09:26,540 --> 02:09:31,580
true and that's something games done quick is going to have to figure out they're probably

1297
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:37,740
going to have to pay it uh and and uh figure it out from their uh list viewership and maybe have

1298
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:41,980
to have some fundraisers because you know they have they have their channel they run that channel

1299
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:47,740
most of the time and it's not always for charity so they might run their own kind of fundraisers

1300
02:09:47,740 --> 02:09:52,940
to sort of you know fundraise to run the funds they like cover that stuff so they don't go

1301
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:56,780
bankrupt i'm sure people would be more than willing to jump in i'm sure they will i'm sure

1302
02:09:56,780 --> 02:10:02,700
they will well that happened to magfest a couple of years back they they cancelled magfest paid

1303
02:10:02,700 --> 02:10:08,220
off the cancellation fees and had a telethon made and made the money back yeah so i'm sure

1304
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:13,180
games done quick could do the same easy and and lastly there was something else but i totally

1305
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:18,060
forgot but that's just how my my memory is got the retention of a goldfish sometimes but um i

1306
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:22,300
kind of want to jump back to what you're talking about dragon con and the conventions and so forth

1307
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:28,060
you know there are times when i have to deal with people like that in my own circles i just

1308
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:35,980
want to just shake them if not shake them slap some sense into them what people don't understand

1309
02:10:35,980 --> 02:10:42,460
is that if a con cancels they got to pay all these fees out and sometimes they don't have

1310
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:49,580
to depending on you know the local ordinances about covet and so forth and once we get past that

1311
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:54,460
you have cons are like okay we're gonna do our thing but you gotta follow these rules you have

1312
02:10:54,460 --> 02:11:02,620
to mask up and all this and so forth and there are people that will push back and i remember

1313
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:07,020
one of my favorite conventions i was actually getting into a pissing fight with somebody over

1314
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:12,700
this and the people that run the convention messaged me begging me to stop and walk away

1315
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:18,940
this one person was demanding that the con go on she didn't care about wearing a mask because she

1316
02:11:18,940 --> 02:11:25,820
said she was dying anyway she just wanted to have a good time and i'm just like who hurt you

1317
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:33,340
you know that's and that's why that's why i don't fault dragon con or any con for what happened

1318
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:38,700
number one i knew what situation i was working walking into number two my understanding is they

1319
02:11:38,700 --> 02:11:42,940
tried and what happened is that people were basically fighting with them those are the people

1320
02:11:42,940 --> 02:11:51,500
that i blame like but rob let me say this you didn't walk into anything you went in full well

1321
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:56,780
knowing what was going on and you followed the protocols so that's what you did that was that's

1322
02:11:56,780 --> 02:12:04,060
perfectly fine indeed you do that not just for personal when you go out you do this for work i

1323
02:12:04,060 --> 02:12:10,620
mean they just said on the subways you do not have to wear a mask oh i saw that yeah i wear a

1324
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:15,980
mask because you know what i don't trust half these people out here i'm just like no no i know

1325
02:12:15,980 --> 02:12:25,020
people who have caught covid like three four times and it freaks me out i'm just saying i've been a

1326
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:32,220
lot i rode it i rode the atlanta subway on tuesday while i was apparently now now that i know i'm

1327
02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:38,380
such a while i was contagious those folks should be thanking me for wearing a mask honestly so

1328
02:12:38,940 --> 02:12:42,780
no i don't i don't need a medal or a treat i had to do what i had to do to get home

1329
02:12:42,780 --> 02:12:46,380
but you know it's just kind of one of those like it's not hard to wear a mask

1330
02:12:47,180 --> 02:12:51,980
it's common sense and as i said before covid one of those things that actually scares me because

1331
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:57,740
i have actually known people who are on the brink of death and just bounced back from it and i'm

1332
02:12:57,740 --> 02:13:06,860
just like you know and next weekend i'm going to a con with somebody she cannot be vaccinated

1333
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:12,540
due to her medical condition and i got masks and everything and i'm just like

1334
02:13:12,540 --> 02:13:17,900
and i'm just hoping that she's she'll be fine through this and she's already survived a round

1335
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:26,700
of covid so um that is uh yeah but it's interesting so you but you saying she's going to the con

1336
02:13:26,700 --> 02:13:30,540
anyway and i think there would be a lot of people out there that would like to tell her

1337
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:38,380
don't do it but you know it's it's her decision it's her decision not yours and that's that's

1338
02:13:38,380 --> 02:13:43,420
that's what was making me angry earlier right but the thing is she'll be wearing a mask so there's

1339
02:13:43,420 --> 02:13:48,380
that now it'd be a different story like there are some conventions that are like they they're

1340
02:13:48,380 --> 02:13:53,340
there are some cons where it's like you must have your your shots you must have your booster

1341
02:13:53,340 --> 02:14:00,700
and you must show proof of a negative test like 24 hours before the con you know and there are

1342
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:05,580
people that argue that and yes there are those conventions that have that restrictive rules

1343
02:14:06,140 --> 02:14:11,900
it still happens but i always argue just wait just wait so everything is said and done you

1344
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:17,820
count the numbers because of how strict they were the numbers on that's going to be very low and

1345
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:23,500
and that's all that really matters i mean hell i went to a con a year and a half ago and i refused

1346
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:31,500
to support them because they had a covid scare they they actually put that someone may have

1347
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:38,300
tested positive and an email blast they sent out congratulating the winners of a raffle they put

1348
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:43,740
that at the bottom and then i found out the next day they posted on their social medias

1349
02:14:43,900 --> 02:14:53,660
i i was just absolutely freaked yes it was a thin chance i caught it but it's just how they handled

1350
02:14:53,660 --> 02:14:59,100
the situation and then i found that one of my friends who's a voice actor in the industry

1351
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:05,580
was a guest at that con and they never told him oh wow so that's yeah and i know i know i know

1352
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:09,340
you were saying that like the convention sort of you know had a responsibility to tell people and

1353
02:15:09,340 --> 02:15:14,300
so forth i i also have to say that rama like i i don't necessarily disagree like at least

1354
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:17,820
it would have been in their best interest to at least put out a tweet that said hey we had

1355
02:15:17,820 --> 02:15:22,540
a lot of people here this weekend you know you should follow these you know covid things for

1356
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:25,660
safety or you should get a test and know your status or whatever like that would have been

1357
02:15:25,660 --> 02:15:31,420
really nice i think it would be a good thing however there it it's also necessary to put

1358
02:15:31,420 --> 02:15:36,460
some fucking accountability on the attendees you went to a convention that was intended by thousands

1359
02:15:36,460 --> 02:15:43,740
and thousands of people if you don't think you were exposed to covid i i i don't i don't know

1360
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:49,660
there are some common sense things i don't know how to explain to people but also there's a

1361
02:15:49,660 --> 02:15:56,220
financial aspect of it like some of the hotels don't want to push back because these people will

1362
02:15:56,220 --> 02:16:02,300
cancel their rooms and that's less money coming in that weekend and given how the economy is you know

1363
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:08,460
you gotta take take the hits where you can without being knocked out which i do understand to a

1364
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:15,420
certain extent i'm one of those it's like if that if i'm running the place if that means y'all don't

1365
02:16:15,420 --> 02:16:22,060
show up and i lose their type of money that's fine the liability has dropped a lot at the end

1366
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:26,940
of the day i will count my blessings count the money and see if we can do something next year

1367
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:31,340
or if i'm running the hotel see we see if we can continue to keep the people on staff to keep the

1368
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:38,300
hotel open you know i i'm sorry there no you're not wrong but there is an important element of

1369
02:16:38,300 --> 02:16:44,460
dragon con you have to remember um with those hotels and that is that there is a lot going on

1370
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:50,860
in atlanta on labor day and even though i can't imagine being in that hotel and not being at

1371
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:56,140
dragon con there are people that go to those hotels that are staying there for the football

1372
02:16:56,140 --> 02:17:01,180
games that are happening in town this weekend and guess who the crowd is that doesn't want to

1373
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:04,300
wear the fucking mask around the hotel and the hotel doesn't want to be the bad guy

1374
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:13,500
there have been times where odor con has happened and right across from the bc i mean from the

1375
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:19,020
convention center you you have a bunt you have camden yards so they're so those people are coming

1376
02:17:19,020 --> 02:17:25,500
out seeing us running around in fabrics are like who are those freaks mind you we see them wearing

1377
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:30,220
sports attire and they're painted up and we're like who are those weirdos you know

1378
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:40,860
well i'm just glad things are starting to get better not at the rate that it should be but

1379
02:17:40,860 --> 02:17:46,700
at least we're getting somewhere you know at least the the evolutions of the virus seem to

1380
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:50,940
be getting weaker and that's you know we just have to hope it keeps going in that direction

1381
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:56,300
like i said earlier this last week has not been pleasant do not let me try to make it sound like

1382
02:17:56,380 --> 02:18:01,500
covid was a pleasant experience the second time or into that stuff no it sucked you do not want this

1383
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:07,900
however swine flu was worse like i said that was i was worse i was i i remember one night when i

1384
02:18:07,900 --> 02:18:15,340
had swine flu i was like this is it this is the end that i mean i i laugh now but it wasn't funny

1385
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:23,580
then so uh i i i i it hasn't been as bad as that but ev your mileage may vary look i got a friend

1386
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:29,260
who caught covid back in december it's been nine months she still has a lingering cough so

1387
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:34,620

1388
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:41,340

1389
02:18:41,340 --> 02:18:45,100
you've heard to your friend you're like how are you doing that man i don't know man yeah i'm all

in the season one premium battle pass um documented or it's like the description for that

1400
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:52,220
which i don't know if they they've pulled that down or not but they actually have like

1401
02:19:52,220 --> 02:20:01,180
i think video or screenshots of the hero uh who has cat ears so um

1402
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:07,100
yeah they're not too happy about that she's gonna be a support character i think i don't

1403
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:09,740
remember oh she's a teleporting fox girl

1404
02:20:13,660 --> 02:20:17,260
sorry i just realized i was muted while i was typing um that sounds like it could be fun

1405
02:20:18,860 --> 02:20:24,300
ever everybody loves a cat girl and a fox girl right of course yeah they said it was uploaded

1406
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:29,500
to a spanish um or uploaded in spanish it was an animated short for the character

1407
02:20:30,060 --> 02:20:35,740
and it said with a still in progress render like tag on it so i'm

1408
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:42,380
i probably shouldn't have been leaked out probably not um but hey it could be like street fighter

1409
02:20:42,380 --> 02:20:48,460
six and your entire roster could have already been leaked so there is that yeah things things

1410
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:52,940
could always be a little worse right it'd be worse yeah all right um i want to see if we have any

1411
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:56,220
tweets i know there was at least one i wanted to read because there was a follow-up to something

1412
02:20:56,220 --> 02:20:59,820
that had come up on a prior episode so i'm looking at twitter right now if you want to

1413
02:20:59,820 --> 02:21:04,140
follow us on twitter we actually we are lucky enough to have a three letter name it's o-l-r

1414
02:21:04,140 --> 02:21:09,980
on twitter you can't even get that anymore o-l-r uh and if you want to follow us uh on twitter you

1415
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:15,420
sure can and you can send us tweets throughout the week uh such as a tweet that we got from

1416
02:21:17,980 --> 02:21:23,580
uh i'm having to scroll through some comments that i made on the marvel game ah here it is um

1417
02:21:24,220 --> 02:21:32,220
zeba uh had tweeted saying here is the vod of cirque's production of clue in final fantasy 14

1418
02:21:32,220 --> 02:21:37,100
they had some technical difficulties and the audio didn't record so they manually put in the

1419
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:43,900
soundtrack there's no in-game sounds it's a bit weird but it's still great so that was a tweet uh

1420
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:49,820
from zeba uh who who sent us that and i actually did so it was uh them doing clue and it was the

1421
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:58,380
movie uh they did it in uh final fantasy 14 and it was pretty um it was pretty neat but

1422
02:21:58,380 --> 02:22:03,420
you could see where the technical limitations kind of unfortunately got in the way a little bit

1423
02:22:03,420 --> 02:22:09,660
because um they like like characters would pop in and out because there were too many people

1424
02:22:09,660 --> 02:22:14,780
that were in the zone and so they weren't able yeah it's so so like characters would kind of

1425
02:22:14,780 --> 02:22:18,060
like come and go and stuff like that i'm actually trying to see if i can bring it up here on the

1426
02:22:18,060 --> 02:22:23,820
other monitor uh for you all oops you don't necessarily need to have the full music from

1427
02:22:23,820 --> 02:22:28,940
the theme but there you go if you've never heard the music from clue let me see actually i really

1428
02:22:28,940 --> 02:22:32,700
want to kill that because that's probably copyright music sorry about that uh let me

1429
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:36,060
go to the other screen here you can actually see so here's the production let me make that

1430
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:41,340
filled to the page there so you could see there is and so you can kind of see how it starts but

1431
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:45,820
then when you really get into like what's happening throughout the event like look at

1432
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:49,820
like all of these people here and whoever's recording this has to get like right up next

1433
02:22:49,820 --> 02:22:57,660
to the dinner table to see what's going on and then in other places i want to do the scenes where

1434
02:22:57,660 --> 02:23:02,060
it's really cutting in and out i think that was right maybe more towards the beginning like you

1435
02:23:02,060 --> 02:23:05,820
could just see how many people are in there and it's kind of hard to see like well who's the

1436
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:09,740
character speaking and what what's happening and characters kind of pop in and out really fast

1437
02:23:10,460 --> 02:23:15,660
but i loved if you actually read like what's going on with the script they actually

1438
02:23:15,660 --> 02:23:21,020
localized things to fit aorza and the final fantasy universe and i thought it was super

1439
02:23:21,020 --> 02:23:25,580
cute like what they were doing with that so it was clever and my honest suggestion would be

1440
02:23:26,380 --> 02:23:32,700
do a performance of this just for the vod like i i know that it's very attractive to do this in

1441
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:37,900
game and get people to the house and all this type of stuff but do a performance for the vod

1442
02:23:37,900 --> 02:23:42,220
like you know and that whole thing and and really show off you know the talent that goes into it

1443
02:23:42,220 --> 02:23:46,380
without the technical problems of having people you know show up and stuff and some comments from

1444
02:23:46,380 --> 02:23:51,180
chat so as joan hunter matt says dinner theater fantasy style and dr cio says wow that's great

1445
02:23:51,180 --> 02:23:56,380
yeah like it's it's really clever and cool and unique and this is one of the those spontaneous

1446
02:23:56,380 --> 02:24:02,220
things that happens to mmos that i love um but just some of the technical issues of the game

1447
02:24:02,780 --> 02:24:08,300
aren't really prepared for it and that's a bummer all right well with that that was it for the

1448
02:24:08,300 --> 02:24:13,420
tweets tonight and we did not get any emails that participate at orangeslaunchradio.com

1449
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:16,940
but i will invite you to send some for next week so again that's participate at

1450
02:24:16,940 --> 02:24:21,420
orangeslaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email i think that's going to do it for the show

1451
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:26,860
my voice is about done with tonight as well so i think we're going to wrap up uh but let's go

1452
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:31,020
around and get uh final thoughts and stuff uh before that i will say thank you as always for

1453
02:24:31,020 --> 02:24:36,620
listening to orange launch radio um if you enjoyed what you heard here please tell a friend about

1454
02:24:36,620 --> 02:24:40,460
the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice and

1455
02:24:40,460 --> 02:24:45,900
in order to get those voices out on air we need more people here a nice five-star review on a

1456
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:51,260
site like itunes spotify or wherever you found this podcast that all goes an awful long way

1457
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:56,620
super appreciate that before i get to my final thought i have to make sure we say this at some

1458
02:24:56,620 --> 02:25:02,540
point as well i know we've had a lot of um bummer news tonight and things in our lives that we're

1459
02:25:02,540 --> 02:25:09,260
dealing with and so forth but on a somewhat more positive note i should note the date is september

1460
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:16,300
11th and no i'm not referring to historical events uh in a in a winsmick way that would be tacky i

1461
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:22,540
am referring to the fact that september 11th happens to be loki's birthday it does happy

1462
02:25:22,540 --> 02:25:27,820
birthday loki thank you did you get to do anything for your day in spite of everything

1463
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:33,580
that's going on i did nothing and it was everything i thought it would be is that a good

1464
02:25:33,580 --> 02:25:38,460
thing because sometimes doing nothing for your birthday is a good thing no i just worked on i

1465
02:25:38,460 --> 02:25:45,260
worked on my uh my build for um my next episode still well you had a productive day then that's

1466
02:25:45,260 --> 02:25:51,500
good yep that's what i've been trying to do i have to go back to work tomorrow which i don't want to

1467
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:58,540
do but um yeah i did want to mention though that i will be uh i think channel 64 is doing her next

1468
02:25:58,540 --> 02:26:05,420
stream weekend on saturday okay so um i may be participating in that as well so just stay tuned

1469
02:26:05,420 --> 02:26:13,900
to uh twitter or my youtube channel probably we'll have uh the schedule for that well the least the

1470
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:19,180
least you could do for loki's birthday everybody is follow him on his youtube and his twitch and

1471
02:26:19,180 --> 02:26:23,500
his socials so yes subscribe to the youtube channel if you're not already every little bit

1472
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:31,020
helps loki olr right yes all right uh okay now that i finally got that out of my system i meant

1473
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:36,700
to say it um earlier but you know we got in a uh debate about something else so um i want to make

1474
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:41,660
sure we got that happy birthday out though it is important so uh do you have any final thoughts

1475
02:26:41,660 --> 02:26:48,300
for our folks tonight loki nope just uh i can't wait for the next episode to be done it well

1476
02:26:48,300 --> 02:26:53,660
hopefully be done this weekend but that's a lot of building i gotta do it's it's really big

1477
02:26:54,620 --> 02:27:02,220
but yeah it's really cool um i can't wait for you to see it uh and i i don't have a lot to say here

1478
02:27:02,220 --> 02:27:06,300
either just um you know i've said a lot earlier in the show i hope to get back into streaming on

1479
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:11,900
my own this week you know i usually leave dragon con so motivated to stream again from all the

1480
02:27:11,900 --> 02:27:16,380
panels and things that i did so it really sucks that covet kind of put the brakes on that um

1481
02:27:16,380 --> 02:27:20,700
because i would have been right back into it this week but it didn't happen but i am hoping i'm

1482
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:23,820
getting better enough especially from doing this show tonight and hopefully that continues tomorrow

1483
02:27:23,820 --> 02:27:30,300
although my number one onus right now needs to be taken care of alan and making sure he has all his

1484
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:35,820
needs net but assuming that is all taken care of i will stream tomorrow i want to make sure i i do

1485
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:38,940
that and kind of get back in the habit of that i have no idea what i'm going to play yet but i'll

1486
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:45,980
play something um so yeah oh really quick quick i did want to mention since we didn't recover before

1487
02:27:45,980 --> 02:27:51,420
for the live folks who are watching on twitch the game behind me is called one dreamer is a game

1488
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:59,420
that came out uh this week and it's like a i think it's a point click adventure game sort of where

1489
02:27:59,420 --> 02:28:05,100
you do coding in it as well i played the the demo a while back and it was pretty awesome i i'm

1490
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:09,580
hoping to get a chance to play this the full game but apparently i think it was made by a single

1491
02:28:09,580 --> 02:28:16,300
person over the course of seven years so it's just it's about kind of i haven't played it all

1492
02:28:16,300 --> 02:28:20,140
the way but i think it's supposed to be about and it's probably going to ring true to a little bit

1493
02:28:20,140 --> 02:28:28,380
to me um about like indie game devs and like these projects that they kind of set aside for a long

1494
02:28:28,380 --> 02:28:34,940
time and going back to like finish them some type of things so i think that that's some of it but

1495
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:39,980
yeah it's pretty cool you should go check it out sounds like it might hit close to home all right

1496
02:28:39,980 --> 02:28:42,940
that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio we'll be back in seven

1497
02:28:42,940 --> 02:28:46,780
days to do it again hopefully dark sakura is feeling up to joining us as well that week and
