0	15620	Do you hear that? All that furious typing? No? Right! Because the pace of news is down
15620	18960	and the media's summer holiday started. At least until summer game sales and listicles
18960	22400	start getting churned out. But don't worry, it's never a completely quiet week. The
22400	26400	evergreen topics live up to their name, new collections, new legals, and bad decisions.
26400	29640	Enough to fill time. Sort of like what I'm doing for this intro.
29640	32660	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to bring you the news
32660	36000	we do have. Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44300	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
44300	51200	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode
51200	59440	number 919 of our show for tonight, June 19 of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I
59440	67800	am joined as always by my co-hosts for the last 19.90 years because next week is a big
67800	71440	number. First off, we have DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
71440	72440	Hi.
72440	73440	Hi, how are you?
73440	76200	I'm all right. How are you?
76200	80600	I'm doing good. I was just obviously listening to Jason's intro and kind of laughing at
80600	84040	that. It's a slow news week to this week in the gaming world. You know, we're coming
84040	89120	off that not E3 period and the, you know, summer breaks and things. And there's a few
89120	97440	things to talk about, but not a ton. And so, yeah, there's that. And then, so on top of
97440	103480	that, then I'm thinking in the real world, there's actually a lot going on today. Juneteenth
103480	108320	is today. Happy Juneteenth. Father's Day. Happy Father's Day to anybody that that applies
108320	114600	to. Pride Month's still going on. It's probably somebody's birthday. What am I forgetting?
114600	119920	There's a lot going on today. So busy, busy June 19th. So I'm happy, happy everything
119920	127520	to all of you out there and play some video games to celebrate. Also want to say hello
127520	133760	to Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki. Who for some reason I'm not hearing tonight. I don't know
133760	135080	if it just cut out for a second.
135080	136080	Made it, that's right.
136080	138640	OK, you see, you got me thinking it's on my end. How are you doing, Loki?
139120	139800	I'm doing fine.
139920	145560	Good. So, yeah, there's a lot of a lot of weird tech odd stuff going on, and that is
145560	148760	because I'm running on a new computer tonight.
149280	152760	During the week this week, I actually got a new to me computer.
153080	155480	I haven't upgraded my computer in the last five years.
156320	163720	And Alan was very much like, I don't want to build a new computer because especially I
163720	164800	don't want to do two.
165440	167080	Can we just buy like a pre-build?
167080	168720	And I was like, sure, let's do it.
168720	170080	Let's buy a pre-build computer.
170320	175160	And so we got matching computers from one of those pre-build companies.
175560	178080	They didn't give it to me for free, so I'm not giving them an ad.
178840	181080	It depends on what you consider expensive.
181640	182640	I'll text you later.
182640	186400	I'm not really comfortable saying the budget on air because, you know, it's yeah, some
186400	190160	people are that's I've wanted to know relative to your to your ideas.
191000	193480	Yeah, yeah, it's I would say it was on the pricier end.
193800	199840	What we did, but we had some some work bonus type things, PTO cash out that we were able
199840	201480	to do to make it work.
201480	205760	So, yeah, so, yeah, we were able to do that.
205760	213240	And actually, it's funny because Bobby Black Wolf actually helped before us here on O.L.R.
213400	218160	because Alan, you know, he is more of a tech mindset, but he wanted a second pair of eyes
218320	220960	and he's like, who else like builds computer stuff?
220960	223360	And I mean, we know a lot of people that do that stuff.
223360	225560	But, you know, it really gets into the weeds of that stuff.
225560	228760	And so he thought of Bobby and I guess Bobby did give the computers his blessing.
229120	234640	So whereas the new computer stuff is great and actually OBS with the import export
234640	238800	functionality of the scenes made it really easy to carry most of the show stuff over.
239240	243000	The audio stuff is really a little bit of a mess tonight.
243000	248040	And what I'm also learning just now for the first time, a bad mistake I made.
248400	252640	Oops, I forgot to install the stream deck software.
254320	256680	But that's not very big or a long install.
257000	261320	No, it's not. And I only really, really, really need it for one thing.
261320	265640	And that is the little sidebar that shows when we're live on Twitch, because we do tape
265640	271040	live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash vog network, the Voice of Geeks network,
271040	274360	nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
274360	279000	And the only thing I really need it for, I can control the scenes if I need to on my list
279000	282640	in OBS, but I use it for the up and down for the right bar.
282880	287680	Now, I do know of and Bobby is probably typing in chat right now, the plan B for that.
287680	288840	I do know there is one.
288840	292880	It's just a lot. It's a lot less convenient, but that's probably what I'll just have to do
292880	294880	for the night until I can actually.
294880	299800	But I knew it's those little things like that I was going to discover as we were going on
300040	301160	through the show tonight.
302880	308360	Looking in chat, Bobby Black Wolf says, Alan gave me the three finalists and I told him I
308360	309280	won two and three.
309280	312560	Yes, they played the computer dating game, basically, which was nice.
313200	317520	And Quest Buster says pricey right now, but that's an investment for the years ahead.
317760	318520	Absolutely.
318520	319920	And I'm going to be perfectly honest.
319920	323200	We're new homeowners and we kind of had a discussion.
323760	328600	We could really use a new kitchen table, but do we want a new kitchen table right now or is
328600	330120	the one that we're using good enough?
330240	333960	And honestly, we kind of need new computers because the computers are what we use more
333960	335160	than anything.
335360	339880	And I think Alan has been feeling a little bit creatively stagnant because he was streaming
339880	341120	on Twitch for a long time.
341360	343120	He stopped for the last little bit.
343120	346440	And I think it's because he was getting frustrated, like the technical limitations of the
346440	352560	computer. And, you know, he can't stream things like Elden Ring because the computer he had
352560	355960	wouldn't run it. Well, trust me, this new one will run it and he can stream it if he
355960	358640	wants whenever he decides to get back up and running with that.
358640	363440	So the same goes for me, really, is I don't have to rely on my Xbox Series X to stream
363440	366280	everything. I should be able to do a lot more on the PC.
366800	372400	On that note, I also saw in chat over Twitch.tv slash Vaga Network, somebody had
372400	376920	suggested, oh, you should start streaming OLR in 1080p.
377160	380800	And actually, I did have this, actually, no, it was Alan that said that early on.
381080	384600	I did have that same thought early on because I was like, oh, that would be fun.
384840	385960	But here's the thing.
385960	392240	Because we aren't partner, Twitch doesn't down sample the stream for everyone else.
392720	397320	So if I broadcast at 1080, everybody would be forced to watch at 1080.
397600	403320	And that might not work with your bandwidth and your Wi-Fi and the way many of you tune
403320	404800	into the show on Sunday nights.
404840	408240	It wouldn't affect anybody on the podcast feed, but I want to be mindful of those that
408240	409640	are here on Sunday nights as well.
409720	412040	And so that's why I chose not to go that route.
412040	415880	However, I did bump it back up to 60 frames a second.
415920	420200	We were only on 30 frames a second, and I'm not sure 60 frames is going to change that
420200	422280	much. But there you go.
422280	426440	I did throw that little, but we're going to still be in 720p for a little bit.
426760	435400	So Bobby actually does say, oh, Twitch does down sample, but it's not guaranteed.
435560	440960	And that's honestly the lack of guarantee is enough for me because the one night I
440960	445960	decide to do 1080p, it'll be, oh, say the 20th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.
446120	448360	And then people are saying, I can't hear it.
448360	450040	I can't hear it. The show's a flop.
450600	451520	And all that stuff.
452560	453880	So, all right.
455680	459880	Anyhow, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.
459880	461640	There's a lot of stuff going on in gaming.
461640	464120	No, there's not. But we're going to pretend there is.
464360	466840	There's a couple big headlines, at least.
467040	470480	So let's get into the big headlines and we'll start with tonight's kickoff topic.
470640	473360	We'll go over to Loki, who's going to start us off tonight.
474120	481560	Yeah, so they did a this is kind of the second part of key three, the not E3 event
481560	488360	that takes place around Summer Game Fest, but Square Enix had their Final Fantasy 7
488360	493480	25th anniversary live stream and they announced stuff for that.
493480	499960	So, of course, the next being the next part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake, which is now
500320	505240	Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and it's continuing on the story there.
505240	508880	And then they said that's going to be coming out, I believe next fall.
509720	514720	And along with that, they confirmed that it is a three part series that's going to be
514720	519200	which kind of we figure as much since the first part kind of took place.
520160	525320	Which, you know, back in the original version of it, like the first disc of the of the game.
525880	529320	So, you know, they're they're going to make it three parts.
529720	535960	And then along with that, of course, we've got them remaking the.
537040	543880	Was that Final Fantasy seven crisis core is going to be remade as well, and that's coming
543880	544840	out this year.
545160	547520	So this fall, which is kind of interesting.
548880	550440	But yeah, I mean, it looks good.
550920	552720	I need to finish playing through it.
553800	555040	Oh, you never finished the remake?
555800	556360	I didn't.
556560	558080	Oh, it's so good.
558160	558880	Well, I have.
558920	560360	OK, so here's the thing.
561000	564560	People have been calling this game Final Fantasy seven remake part two.
564560	567480	And now we know that that isn't really going to be the name.
567480	573280	And it's some of the takes on social media have me kind of wondering who's got a hot take
573280	578160	that actually hasn't played the Final Fantasy seven remake, because I'm going to tell you
578160	580240	what I believe is a minor plot spoiler.
580240	583800	But at this point, Loki, I'm sorry, it's been out for two years.
584120	588160	I feel if the plot points are sensitive, you would have played it by now.
588160	588880	Here's the thing.
590280	596080	If you play through the game, the whole gag about it being a remake is a plot point.
597320	603360	And the fact that the game there is a certain legacy and a certain set of rules that the
603360	609160	game feels like it has to live up to, and there comes a very clear part in the game where
609160	612000	the game says we are going to deviate from this.
612480	618280	And what happens is that a major character is killed who is not supposed to be killed.
619600	625040	And what happens is that basically a outside force and I'm not going to get into everything
625720	630760	kind of rewinds that incident so that that doesn't happen, because when that originally
630760	637480	happens, it's like a what the fuck moment, because that person doesn't die.
638440	644920	For what you know, but that was the game setting the rules to say, this is not the same Final
644920	646640	Fantasy 7 you knew.
647840	653600	This is a Final Fantasy 7 multi, I would say this whole multiverse phenomenon that we've
653600	656440	seen with the Doctor Strange, everything everywhere all at once.
656680	662400	This is really what Final Fantasy 7 is kind of at now is that this is a Final Fantasy 7
662400	668760	separate, Final Fantasy 7 separate universe where a different series of events has taken
668760	669320	place.
669680	675280	And it kind of compounds that when you get towards the end of the game and a series of
675280	679600	events that happens at the end of the game that kind of shows like, wait a minute now, and
679600	685200	this is why it's important that Crisis Core is coming out again, because there's a series of
685200	690720	events where it's like, wait a minute, this isn't the way it played out in Final Fantasy 7.
691720	696680	So yes, fifth dream in chat says, then it's a redo, not a remake.
696800	697800	Absolutely.
697960	703000	And I think a really appropriate way to phrase it is that it's a rebirth.
703360	710000	And that's why I think this title that they have for part two is super appropriate, because it's
710000	711560	Final Fantasy 7 rebirth.
711720	715000	And so everybody's asking, well, is Aerith going to die?
715000	715920	Is Aerith going to die?
717600	719480	It's not guaranteed.
720240	722360	I don't think she will.
723480	724120	Well, I'm not sure.
724120	725920	I'm not so sure I'm going to hedge my bets on that.
726200	729320	They'll kill her and then they'll rewind time again and kill her again.
731240	731880	Maybe.
732080	732680	I don't know.
732880	739160	And I think now that's the big question mark is, is the game going to play out the way we expect
739160	739560	it to?
739560	741280	Because the answer is already no.
742320	745120	And so everything is up for renegotiation.
745720	750200	Every, you know, and there's this whole fact that, like, you know, you had the whole side story, the
750200	753040	DLC, which, to be fair, I have not played through.
753240	758880	But we all know that Yuffie was not in the original game early on in the Midgar component, but they
758880	760400	introduced her here in like a side.
760400	765160	Meanwhile, in another part of the galaxy, I thought there was a way to get her in Midgar.
765160	768840	Like there was like a little playground area that there's a very small chance to get her.
768880	769560	I thought.
771760	774160	Maybe, but we'll just say unintentionally.
774200	778080	That's not like or like that's not really the way most people experience that game.
778080	778400	Right.
778720	782600	And so it's very different in this remake.
782600	788720	So I just I think we need to stop calling this the Final Fantasy seven remake series, because if you
788720	792400	played the first game, you already know this is not a shot for shot remake.
792600	801400	And I thought I quite frankly, I thought it was quite frankly genius in the game that they made the
801440	806120	expectations of doing a remake of Final Fantasy seven a plot point.
807920	813640	Because when I was playing through the game, Alan walked into the room and he was like, you know what
813640	821720	this is, he says this this is this is Nomura, this is a representation of the fans in the game.
821720	824400	He said this is Nomura's fans telling him he can't do this.
824920	826720	By golly, he kind of nailed it.
826920	829400	Like he called what it was like early on.
829440	836360	So I just I that's why I actually thought Final Fantasy seven remake actually was really, really
836360	839760	good, is that it is not a shot for shot remake of Final Fantasy seven.
839760	845000	And when you kind of get to that point, you start to sort of realize, oh, the whole like we're
845000	853480	remaking a legendary game and having to live up to the pressures of that is a plot point.
853480	854600	I actually think it's brilliant.
854600	862760	So anyway, so it's remake, rebirth, and then I'm sure the third part will be re coded, re reborn,
863000	865120	re resurrected.
865360	865880	I don't know.
866080	867080	So but I'm sure.
867280	868240	Oh, you know what?
868560	869680	That's that's it.
870920	872360	I think that's where it ends up going.
872640	878960	Aerith dies, but then they realize that they can change these sorts of fates and Final Fantasy seven
878960	880760	resurrected is bringing her back.
882960	883760	That's my bet.
885400	886040	So we'll see.
887080	893120	But I am excited to give Crisis Core and all that stuff, I play because I didn't really play through
893120	896400	it and when it was originally on PSP or any of that anyway.
896400	903840	So Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the end of remake talks a lot about destiny and how certain
903840	907880	characters know what destiny is and how we're going against destiny.
908080	908640	Yes.
908960	915160	And that was it was a little more subtle in the original Final Fantasy seven, but it really beat
915160	919720	you over the head with it in the remake, and that is the fact that Aerith knew she was going to die
919720	921400	and Sephiroth knew he was going to kill her.
922000	926640	And that in the original Final Fantasy seven, it's more subtle.
926680	928720	It's something you don't really figure it out until the end.
929040	935840	But in the remake, you are it's very explicit that this is something that they know through the
935840	936160	game.
936400	940600	So anyway, I know a lot of you might be going, oh, Rob, it's been two years.
940600	941360	I haven't played the game.
941360	941920	Why did you have to?
942040	949320	Because I'm at a point where I can't let this social media discussion continue from uninformed
949320	953480	individuals who continue to still think this is a literal remake of the game.
954000	958560	And if you haven't got if you've gone the two years and reimaging, yeah, if you've gone the two
958560	962360	years and not played it, then you've told me it's not that much of a high priority to you.
962360	964000	And I need to clear the air.
964760	968920	This once you play the remake, you will understand it is not a remake.
969840	973520	It's a it's a reimagining, a recoding, all those words.
973760	980400	So anyway, Tiger Claw in chat says we've seen stuff like this before, where a character we thought
980400	985080	died was brought back in a follow up and explained how this person somehow survived.
985280	988200	Oh, it happens in movies and stuff all the time, right?
988200	993040	Or or they magically come back through a videotape like Randy and the Scream movies or something
993040	998440	like that. Or, you know, now or they're talking about trying to get Matthew Lillard back in the
998440	1001840	Scream franchise. It's like he very clearly died in the first movie.
1002000	1004800	Well, no one's really dead in a horror movie now, are they?
1004800	1006080	Right. So, yeah.
1006520	1010280	Oh, Bobby Black Wolf also points out Star Trek 2009.
1010560	1016640	That's an excellent comparison to what's happening in the Final Fantasy 7 universe.
1016840	1018520	That is an excellent, excellent comparison.
1018520	1019920	Does the Star Trek reimagined?
1020320	1023800	Hmm. Although it is technically an alternate universe.
1024840	1026040	That is true. Yeah, yeah.
1026040	1032440	Well, yeah, it's very explicitly an alternate universe where Final Fantasy 7 isn't as explicit with that.
1032440	1035040	But yeah, the Kelvin universe or whatever you want to call it.
1035040	1037920	But then then the gag is and why not?
1037920	1040120	Why don't I spoil a Star Trek movie, too?
1040520	1044560	Then when Star Trek, the second one came out, what was the one with Benedict Cumberbatch?
1044560	1045920	What was the subtitle of that?
1045920	1047880	Star Trek Beyond? No, that was third one was Beyond.
1047880	1051400	Star Trek Insurrection was the next one, Into Darkness.
1051400	1052400	OK. Into Darkness.
1052560	1054560	So plot twist for Into Darkness.
1055560	1057560	Into Darkness is just the Wrath of Khan.
1058560	1062320	But they don't tell you that until the end, but they do.
1062320	1070600	But then that one kind of beats you over the head with it because they're kind of like these very clear plot points that happen in Star Trek, the Wrath of Khan.
1070600	1077200	They were like, OK, OK, but what if, what if Kirk and Spock had their roles reversed?
1078880	1085120	And that's why I thought that movie was kind of lame, is that they should adjust from the start, said they were doing a Wrath of Khan remake.
1086520	1089440	That's I don't know. Anyway, all right.
1089600	1095520	I'm getting off track, but I just yeah, I think this Final Fantasy 7 stuff is I'm a spoiler madman.
1095520	1098320	OK, but literally, how old is that Star Trek movie?
1098320	1099440	It's over 10 years old.
1099440	1103120	For an age, the statute of limitations as long as it's passed.
1103120	1103600	It is.
1103600	1108560	I really think when it comes to video games, like six months is about the statute of limitations.
1108560	1110000	And it's been like two years.
1110000	1112320	So just just wanted to say so.
1113360	1118160	All right. Yeah. Bobby says we wanted to do a spoiler cast on Final Fantasy 7 remake after we both finished it.
1118160	1122080	And yeah, it just we never really able to coordinate.
1122080	1123160	And a lot of that is on me.
1123160	1125840	So but yeah, Bobby says Rob and I geeked out over the ending.
1125840	1126600	True, we did.
1126600	1129920	And like because Bobby and I both played it and then we were like talking to each other on phones.
1129920	1132920	It's like I can't talk about this on OLR because I don't want to ruin it for people.
1132920	1134080	But this is so brilliant.
1134080	1136960	This is so like this is not what I expected to happen.
1136960	1137640	It's so good.
1137640	1141200	So but I am intentionally so that you do have a reason to play it.
1141200	1142880	Those of you that haven't done it over the last two years.
1143040	1146840	I'm not telling you what all the changes are that they made because it is interesting.
1147080	1149440	So experience that part for yourselves.
1150480	1154920	But yes, I'm I'm glad they're not calling it Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 2.
1154920	1160520	And in my opinion, anyone that's telling you it should be Remake Part 2 did not play the first game.
1161800	1162160	All right.
1163000	1163400	All right.
1163400	1164120	Thank you, chat.
1164120	1165360	Now they're spoiling everything.
1165360	1165840	All right.
1165840	1166520	Thank you.
1167920	1171520	Gamer Xtafur in chat says, Can I spoil Returnal for everyone then?
1171520	1174400	I love that game and don't mind ruining a few people's dreams.
1174680	1179720	I would prefer you didn't because I still don't have a PS5, but I guess you are past the statute of limitations.
1180040	1180920	Why don't you do this?
1180920	1185360	Xtafur, if you have to spoil someone, text me, but don't ruin the chat.
1185560	1186680	And by the way, it's good to see you.
1188360	1190360	I haven't played it, but you can ruin it for me.
1190360	1199640	I'll be OK because I also know I see like spoilers for Drag Race and Survivor and stuff, and I still watch it because usually the journey is how to get there.
1200680	1202320	So if it's a good story.
1202320	1203760	Isn't that the definition of a journey?
1203840	1205480	Yes, exactly.
1205680	1209200	Or yeah, and E3VL talks about Darth Vader is Luke's father.
1209600	1214000	Anyone our age knows that and probably knew that before.
1214000	1223400	Well, maybe not quite our age because some of us did get to see it in the theater as kids, but most people around our age probably knew that the first time they saw Empire Strikes Back.
1223400	1224200	I know I did.
1224440	1225160	Did that ruin the movie?
1225160	1226200	I saw that in the theater.
1226200	1226480	No.
1227000	1227280	Yeah.
1227280	1231200	I was young, but I saw it in the theater.
1231240	1233800	Actually, I saw Star Wars when I was nine months old, so.
1233800	1236400	And it was quite a revelation at the time, right?
1236440	1236920	Oh, yeah.
1236960	1237400	Oh, yeah.
1237440	1237760	It was huge.
1237800	1240720	Well, I mean, not that I know anything about it since I was nine months old.
1246240	1254880	I was I mean, it's probably the reason why Return of the Jedi is my favorite, because I was actually old enough to have more of a formative memory of seeing it.
1256240	1258200	Or take the movie Titanic.
1258680	1263560	Yes, the boat sinks because it's based on that historical event.
1263560	1267640	But even if you took the fiction part, she's an old lady at the beginning.
1268000	1270120	You know, she lives through the event.
1270800	1273840	You don't see Jack anywhere as an old man.
1274000	1275920	You can guess what happens to Jack.
1276880	1279640	Jack knocked her up and ran off the bum.
1282120	1282720	All right.
1283040	1287440	Yeah, in the real version, he sat on the thing with her and they didn't get hypothermia.
1287440	1289080	And then he was like, oh, you know what?
1289080	1289920	I don't like you anymore.
1289920	1290160	Bye.
1290240	1292000	That's that's the passion of the Christ.
1292000	1292560	I did not.
1292560	1298200	Well, talk about fiction.
1300480	1302480	That's that's the oh, my God.
1302880	1305600	That's the like multiverse movie I want to see.
1305600	1307360	Not Passion of the Christ, but Titanic.
1307640	1309200	I don't need to see torture porn.
1309200	1310560	That's all the passion of the Christ was.
1310560	1316560	But I would I would love to see Titanic, but like the multiverse version that like plays out completely differently.
1316720	1317440	I would love that.
1317440	1318800	They address that in Supernatural.
1318800	1319840	Oh, do they?
1320600	1331800	And and yeah, in this one episode of Supernatural and all because of the Titanic, the the Sam and Dean did not have an Impala.
1331800	1335320	They had a Mustang, which is actually supposed to be the original car they were supposed to drive.
1336040	1338560	Celine Dion did not become famous for the song.
1338760	1340200	In fact, no one knew who she was.
1340200	1341680	She was a lounge singer in Canada.
1341680	1349440	And they were like they they had like all these extra people existing in the universe.
1349440	1352760	That was sort of the reason why they saved the Titanic was to get extra people born.
1354560	1360720	But it was it was pretty funny, like some of the differences that episode was really, really good.
1360720	1367120	It was also it's funny getting to see, you know, one of the fates to out some angels.
1368120	1372400	Some folks in chat talking about what the multiverse of Titanic might look like.
1372400	1377160	Tiger Claw saying a multiverse of Titanic in which a universe the Titanic never sank.
1377560	1381640	You have to be careful walking that line because it was based on a historical event.
1381640	1382680	People really did die.
1382680	1386560	We don't want to be disrespectful, but we can poke all the fun we want at the fictional elements of that.
1386800	1395600	However, I also know that there has been plenty of interesting science fiction type of stories told about major historical events going a different way.
1395840	1398280	Like that is a major plot point in a lot of things.
1398280	1400240	So it doesn't have to be disrespectful.
1400240	1403280	It's just kind of it's just a careful line to walk.
1403280	1404080	That's all I'm saying.
1405000	1420640	But the other thing, too, like thinking, though, just like realistically, you know, if the Titanic hadn't sank or the Olympic or the other ones also like that, that we probably wouldn't have the same safety laws on major sea vessels that we do now.
1420680	1421680	You're absolutely right.
1421840	1422440	You're absolutely right.
1423320	1424200	Let's see other comments.
1424320	1433960	Quest Buster now talks about the total like camp version of that alt history stuff, saying in raise the Titanic, they raise the Titanic to build an anti missile shield.
1433960	1434680	Not joking.
1434680	1436320	Yeah, let's see.
1436720	1442040	Gamer extra for says, anyway, my takeaway from this is that Rose is a murderer in the Alpha Titanic verse.
1442920	1443960	Yeah, yeah.
1444760	1449840	So one other interesting thing, one of my favorite channels is Ask a Mortician.
1450520	1453120	Oh, and oh, yeah.
1453120	1454400	Her channel is fantastic.
1454400	1459960	And also that British drag queen who does all the impersonations did her to it was beautiful.
1461560	1471240	But she she did one about what happened to the bodies and pretty much the bodies have disintegrated.
1472400	1473000	Oh, wow.
1473040	1475320	Because of the underwater pressure.
1475360	1476360	Oh, yeah, yeah.
1476680	1477560	And makes sense.
1478040	1480960	But that's why they would find pairs of shoes.
1481080	1484960	Just by themselves, pair of shoes.
1485960	1488520	Bobby Blackwell says Jamie's learning where to hide your body.
1488520	1489040	Be nice.
1489280	1491880	Well, you know, it's I already know a lot of ways to hide a body.
1491920	1497080	I hope this topic isn't too weird for people, but I want to assure everyone I'm very comfortable talking about this.
1497400	1501760	I have a friend that I met through Rocky Horror who happens to be a mortician.
1502320	1515640	And when my mom passed away, I found that it was actually a really like it was a really good friend to have because he was able to walk me through all these things that are very difficult about the cremation and all that stuff.
1515960	1519880	And I knew I wasn't going to be taken advantage of, like with up sales or anything like that.
1519880	1525440	Like he really was just able to very plainly and effectively tell me and walk me through these steps.
1525440	1531800	And like, there was like such a comfort in that that I can't like articulate very well.
1531800	1536000	But like, I really he sometimes comes into Twitch and watches some of these things.
1536000	1544640	I don't know if he watches OLR, but if he happens to be out there, I just want to say I know we don't talk every day, but I really appreciated that in that moment and having that comfort and so forth.
1544640	1551480	So sometimes it's good to know a mortician and keep some of those tips around because it's one of those things you don't want to use.
1551640	1553800	But when you need it, it's nice.
1554800	1557760	Sometimes it's also good to just be Jewish.
1558840	1561800	Well, faith and religion certainly play a lot.
1561800	1562880	No, there's a reason.
1563040	1565840	Oh, 24 hour burial in a pine box.
1566160	1567880	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1567920	1570520	Yeah, very clear, very clear, very color guidelines.
1570520	1570960	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1571440	1573240	Yep, I'm down for that.
1573240	1577040	Although honestly, I'm going to do the tree pod thing and be planted on federal land.
1578920	1583400	Seriously, if bodies are buried on federal land, it can't be reclaimed for development.
1584800	1589360	Gamer Extifer, on the final note on Titanic here, and then I swear we're moving on.
1589360	1599080	Gamer Extifer says, fun fact, it's common for shoes to wash up on shore with human feet in them because they're the first things to break apart from bodies that get thrown or drown in the ocean.
1599320	1602800	For instance, probably Jack's foot because Rose murdered him.
1603320	1604320	That's a fun fact.
1605520	1608680	Did you notice that his finger breaks off when she lets go of his hand?
1609280	1610440	No.
1611440	1618840	I recognized it the first time I saw the movie that like, it was like his thumb or his finger broke off when she let him go into the water.
1618840	1622920	Are we sure it wasn't a piece of ice that just wasn't clear in 1997 HD?
1622960	1623640	Wow.
1623880	1624720	It was a finger.
1624720	1633160	It was basically this wax model that we have made of him has a faulty finger, either that or a hyper, hyperthermia.
1633200	1633760	Yeah.
1633760	1634600	Hyperthermia.
1634600	1636920	All right, yeah, Dr. Seuss just needs more energy.
1637000	1645840	I love morbid topics like this for the record, and we need to have like another community redeem that's called like, Orange Lounge Morbidio.
1645960	1650880	We still have to make good on the foodie-o redeem, and I keep meaning to schedule that.
1650880	1656240	And then it's like, oh, I'm going to get a new computer and throw everything into, you know, but let's get through the foodie-o.
1656240	1663840	We could do the Memento Mori edition of the Orange Lounge Radio where we just talk about all things death because we know what Memento Mori means.
1663840	1664720	I'm sorry, DJ Ramah.
1664720	1665840	A reminder of death.
1665840	1668400	DJ Ramah S in chat says, it's morbid time.
1671520	1674400	I'll see if my friend will come on the show that week.
1674400	1674680	That'd be cool.
1674680	1675240	That might be fun.
1675240	1675640	All right.
1676280	1685040	Anyway, it would actually be cool to have your friend on when I, when I get my Dead by Daylight thing going, the in-character, the in-character conversation.
1685200	1690800	You actually probably know him, but I'll text you to see I'm not talking about people who aren't here.
1691160	1691800	So, okay.
1692200	1698880	But anyway, I like, uh, the, the science of death, but I hate the economy of it.
1699480	1700080	Yes.
1700160	1700560	Yes.
1701040	1702480	All right, let's move on.
1702560	1704640	Uh, oh, Bobby says two things.
1704640	1706360	Rob needs to check J text Jamie about now.
1707560	1708520	Text her one.
1708560	1712120	See, we multitask here on this show and there's three of us do.
1712280	1713960	And I mean, I'm on a Mac.
1714000	1715560	I can just open my messages.
1715560	1716840	I don't have to look at my phone.
1716840	1719040	Y'all have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.
1719560	1721600	I could be reading fan fiction.
1721840	1726680	I could be plotting, you know, the overthrow of the country because I could run it better.
1727120	1730320	Um, I mean, I'm not going to do any of those things.
1730320	1731160	That's hypothetical.
1731280	1732640	I could do the work zoom call.
1732640	1732920	Oops.
1732960	1735720	I could do the work zoom call thing and have my phone here.
1735760	1738280	Oh, just barely off the camera.
1738280	1739400	I could do that, but.
1739440	1744240	And hey, I work in my pajamas and I draw art while I work.
1744360	1746040	I'm not wearing pants right now.
1746640	1747440	I'm not either.
1747480	1748000	No, I'm just kidding.
1749000	1749880	I have jeans on.
1750080	1751640	I have jeans on everybody.
1751640	1752640	I went out walking.
1752680	1753120	Okay.
1753760	1754080	All right.
1754120	1755360	I'm, I'm wearing shorts.
1756560	1757080	All right.
1757320	1757720	It's fine.
1757720	1758400	Pajama shorts.
1758400	1759200	Dress comfortably.
1759680	1761000	All right, let's move on.
1761000	1767120	We got to get, move on with the show and let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1767360	1767840	Dark soccer.
1767840	1768440	I'm going to start with you.
1768440	1769200	How was your gaming week?
1770120	1771520	Um, it was eventful.
1772080	1772400	Hold on.
1772400	1775600	I'm, I'm telling dark Tetsuya that it's our show and we'll talk about what we want.
1778680	1779320	There you go.
1780160	1781000	So anyway,
1781240	1787920	I love how you had to say it on air and in chat as if there's a chance start to see it doesn't have his audio on right now.
1788760	1796840	No, I, I, I have to reiterate because I'm feeling, I'm feeling a little bit sassy and we can talk about anything we want to.
1796840	1798080	We can talk about corpses.
1798080	1799200	We can talk about hemorrhoids.
1799200	1800640	We can talk about colonoscopies.
1800640	1803960	We can talk about like, the hemophilia.
1804000	1807240	We can talk about anything medical or real life that we want to.
1807760	1808040	Okay.
1808040	1808360	Okay.
1808360	1812480	Loki, this is also the first time that I think I've mentioned a colonoscopy on the show.
1812480	1813680	So, Hey, there you go.
1813720	1814920	Loki, what do you want to talk about?
1814920	1816720	Do you want to talk about your colon or you want to talk about something else?
1817440	1819520	Wait, Loki talked about a colonoscopy before, right?
1820080	1822360	No, no, someone did.
1823280	1827960	No, that was like, you're thinking the kidney stone issues.
1828120	1829200	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
1829560	1829920	Okay.
1830760	1832040	That goes up the other side.
1833440	1833720	Yeah.
1834040	1834520	Well, okay.
1834520	1836280	So I have, I have gaming stuff.
1837280	1839720	And a little bit of expansion on some gaming stuff.
1839720	1842000	We do sell this as a video game podcast.
1842000	1842920	So it would be nice.
1843160	1845400	What the fuck is going on this week, right?
1845400	1856320	I also want to point out if our 20th anniversary should get any media traction, which I doubt it will, but if it does, this is the show people are going to hear leading up to the 20th anniversary.
1856320	1858280	So make it count kids.
1859760	1860440	You know what?
1861640	1862240	Reasons.
1862680	1863120	Anyway.
1864120	1874080	So at any rate, um, I have, I actually, I played Terra Nigma on Wednesday and I got it to the point where I'm just about to beat the game.
1874320	1874720	Nice.
1874800	1881160	So I have stopped and I've put up a poll for what my next game is going to be.
1881760	1886000	And so I believe that final fantasy six went out.
1886360	1892800	Uh, between final fantasy four and final fantasy six, I would, I'm actually looking for a direct translation.
1894080	1898560	I would like my, I voted sticker because I voted for final fantasy four in that poll.
1899640	1905760	Um, at any rate though, I mean, it's either of them are fantastic games.
1905800	1907600	I love to be playing either.
1907880	1911000	Um, but I'm actually thinking the one after that to be star ocean.
1912120	1914440	We had a lot of people interested in me playing star ocean.
1915440	1926000	So, um, but going, uh, back, I've decided that since it is the sixth anniversary for dead by daylight and it's only a two week thing, or as I said, a 13 day thing.
1926840	1939200	Um, I'm basically all of my streams are going to be dead by daylight until it's over, uh, just so that I can make sure I've maximized, uh, my, my blood points and gotten all the goodies.
1939240	1949760	And I had a really fun game, uh, last night on stream where, uh, I was playing pig because I'm a pig main and I don't care what anybody says she's S tier God level.
1950680	1960280	Um, and I decided, and I, there's like one of those, uh, like rift quests to do where you have to find one of the invitation pillars.
1960280	1965320	So basically in the game, you find these pillars that move around at random that have an invitation on them.
1965720	1974840	And when you interact with it, it unlocks a masquerade mask for 12 different characters in the game, you know, all unique to those characters.
1975280	1979280	And I had to do one of those and they were really hard to find.
1979280	1981080	Like I only had six at that point.
1981560	1986280	So I, uh, I went on pig, so, you know, relatively speedy character.
1986680	1995720	I went on, um, and I actually had dead dog, which is I think the smallest map, like the smallest single level map.
1997120	2000000	And basically I just ran around ignoring the survivors.
2000000	2005560	I mean, like I hit a couple of people just, you know, because one of them was a Steven, a Steve and you always hit a Steve.
2006280	2010240	Um, and then I just started wondering around looking for the, uh, the thing.
2010240	2012720	And so they're like, Oh, it's a pig player, boop, boop.
2012720	2014160	And I'm like, okay, get your boops.
2014160	2019600	And then I would turn around and go back to looking for, for the pillar until they realized I was looking for the pillar.
2021480	2025280	So they're like walking along with me, helping me look for the pillar.
2025280	2027680	And someone came and got me and said, there it is.
2027680	2033240	You know, and I was like, cause you know, they can point and I looked over, there's like, Oh my gosh, I almost walked right past it.
2033240	2035960	And cause since it moves, you have to be really quick on it.
2036040	2042440	And I was just like, but it's something that I love about Dead by Daylight, the people that play it.
2043120	2051360	I mean, yeah, you can get like really bully terrible people, you know, that are playing against you and people who don't want to meme with you or any of that.
2051720	2058040	And then you find the people who seem to understand what you're trying to do and help you do it.
2058160	2060440	The nonverbal cue stuff is huge.
2060440	2066840	And you know, it ties into your classic game of the week, last week or the week before was, was Journey from the PlayStation 3.
2067440	2069040	And that was a huge part of that game.
2069080	2076600	I would say Dead by Daylight actually kind of takes its cues from Journey in that regard, where you had like those, that like chirp button is the only way you could communicate with players.
2076800	2080000	But in Dead by Daylight, it's either point or come here.
2080000	2082480	And that's like all the only like two things you can do.
2082480	2089000	So it's really, well, but dance or yeah, you can kind of nods, spins like there are some other things you can do.
2089040	2095120	But for the most part, you're limited to those nonverbal cues and killers have less people get really creative with that.
2095480	2100680	Yeah, like the things that I've learned is that if you're going to help somebody out, you give them the notters.
2101040	2103920	If you don't want to meme around, you shake your head, right?
2105880	2111080	If if you want someone to do an action, you attack the item.
2111080	2118840	Like if I want someone to drop a pallet on me because I had that one where you have to be in chase and have a pallet dropped on you and you break the pallet and then go after them.
2119320	2122080	So I would go back and just hit the pallet and say, hey, hit this.
2122320	2131560	Or if I wanted to let somebody go, I would, you know, or wanted someone to do gens or farm or something, I would hit the generator just with my normal weapon and then kick it.
2131560	2134440	And then, you know, go back and forth, you know, different things like that.
2134440	2141880	Or if, you know, I wanted to like last night I had a doctor game and I was giving somebody and I was actually playing pretty, pretty mean.
2142240	2147840	But I decided that I wanted this one Jill to live and I don't know, just I had this feeling that I wanted this Jill to live.
2147840	2150560	And then I wanted to, you know, hook the bill because fuck Bill.
2152560	2153840	You know how I feel about a bill.
2154320	2154840	I do.
2155960	2158760	Oh, Billiam, oh, Bill, he dies.
2159200	2165960	Anyway, so at any rate, so the I don't think the Jill quite believed me.
2165960	2175480	So I was like, I was doing the electric attack at the at the at the hatch because you can hear when that goes off.
2175480	2176760	And I was like, it's right here, it's right here.
2176920	2183560	And finally, I just went after her and gave her like the super notters and then headed in the direction of the thing.
2183560	2184600	And she's like, oh, I get it.
2184600	2185600	You're being nice.
2185600	2187280	And she went down the hatch.
2187680	2189080	So I love that.
2189080	2190280	But then you get assholes.
2190600	2191040	Yeah, I know.
2191040	2201400	And the assholes have been out in force, like to the point where I'm just keeping a because, you know, now those new what is it?
2201400	2206200	The the build saver things are up.
2206560	2214480	And I have a I have a few that's permanently have light born on it so that no one can flashlight me and then I can laugh at them when I realize that they're doing the oh shit moment.
2215440	2216440	I love that moment.
2218120	2221880	And then, you know, go on about my game and it's been pretty fun.
2222880	2234560	And, you know, I'm not the only one that's noticed that on both sides because, you know, a lot of my survivor main friends are like, oh, these these killers are being like extra sweaty and all of this.
2234560	2238960	And I'm like, well, I mean, it is good for blood points.
2238960	2243120	You know, if everyone brings like the flan, we no longer have cake this year, we have flan.
2244080	2244880	Flantastic.
2245400	2246320	It's flantastic.
2246320	2248080	Yes, a flaniversary.
2249280	2257960	But at any rate, it's it's been a really weird mix and people are also playing weird.
2257960	2258960	Have you noticed that?
2259560	2260560	A little bit.
2260760	2263360	They're not farming like they did during the last event.
2263360	2263800	It's weird.
2263840	2265680	Anyway, not everyone plays dead by daylight.
2265680	2272680	So but can I say one quick thing, though, because this about all games in general, not just dead by daylight, but you talked about it.
2272680	2277440	You talked about the tier list and how you play pig, even though she's not considered S tier.
2277440	2280480	And I think you already know what you're saying to you.
2280480	2281200	She's S tier.
2281200	2282520	But that's the point.
2282520	2287760	That's actually the point is that tier list for any game, Smash Brothers, whatever it is that you're into.
2287960	2290080	Tier lists are bullshit.
2290240	2296560	I'm here to say tier lists are bullshit and they're clickbait and they're there to start an argument.
2296560	2297200	That's all it is.
2297200	2300800	And I don't even care if it's based off statistics.
2300800	2301360	That's right.
2301520	2303600	I'm telling you, I don't care about math.
2303600	2308520	I don't care about facts because video games are supposed to be fun.
2308920	2310480	So the tier list, what?
2311480	2316840	The tier list can be super fun, especially if you make one on stream and you make it like completely ridiculous.
2316840	2320160	If you know that it's ridiculous and not serious.
2320160	2326960	And so when I say like, you know, oh, there's a definitive, you know, some dead by daylight streamer put out the definitive tier list of killers or whatever.
2328600	2330360	Otz Darva puts out those lists.
2330360	2340680	And then when I started playing, I looked at the tier list that existed at that point that Otz made.
2340760	2341120	Yeah.
2341880	2348640	And I was like, okay, I kind of get, you know, reading over, you know, get these perks for these killers, play them in this order.
2348640	2349560	It's a good idea.
2350080	2353720	And then I realized after, you know, I started with plague.
2353720	2355640	I mean, you remember I started with as a plague main.
2356400	2363800	And then I was like, fuck this, Legion's more fun, even though Legion is considered, you know, at the time, not very great.
2364080	2368000	Yeah, it's all about what makes the game fun for you.
2368000	2374400	And for me, I think she's like mid tier on the technical ones or whatever, but I love playing Sadako as the killer.
2374400	2376240	Like she's a lot of fun to me.
2376240	2379200	I love, I really love dredge though, porting around the map.
2379400	2384040	See, and I can't get into dredge the same way I get into Sadako, even though they both have the teleportation mechanic.
2384040	2386880	But Sadako has these add ons that make it really fun.
2386880	2388520	And like, I just really like playing her.
2388520	2389800	So I thought it was fun.
2389800	2390400	Don't get me wrong.
2390400	2391240	I love Sadako.
2391560	2397560	On top of that, she's really short and shorter killers are easier for me to not get motion sick with.
2397600	2400040	Yeah, and it's but that's again, it's taste.
2400040	2402400	So taste greater than tier list.
2402560	2409440	Anyway, I also do like freaking people out with dredge because if you get it just the right moment, you'll scare the shit out of somebody.
2409440	2410840	You can get some good jump scares on him.
2410840	2411340	Yeah.
2411640	2419320	Oh, especially I use this add on where every time he goes through a locker, he exits a locker, all the lockers bang their doors.
2419480	2420720	Oh, that's awful.
2420760	2421760	It's one of his eries.
2422160	2422720	Oh, wow.
2423040	2423360	All right.
2423360	2424000	Yeah.
2424280	2425880	Okay, so back to my other games.
2425920	2426440	Yes.
2426520	2430680	So yeah, it was Terranigma, it was Dead by Daylight, it was wordscapes.
2430680	2438920	But another one I'm going to count because I think that my decisions have helped other people play it or my suggestions is the quarry.
2440520	2446760	So many fucking people are playing the quarry that I feel like I have played it too.
2447720	2450120	Because like, I've gotten into it and like,
2450120	2452120	it's kind of meant to be played like that, though.
2452120	2456800	Like it's, it's a couch co-op game that works really well on Twitch, in a way.
2457480	2462200	Except for, of course, all the QuickTime events, because the person playing it really does need to be on their game.
2462240	2462720	Yeah.
2462760	2465160	Like, especially the ones where you have to shoot things.
2465480	2476000	Oh, but anyway, the the fun thing for me, I mean, and some of the some of the people that have stayed for like long playthroughs have have taken my suggestions.
2476000	2477560	They liked my logic behind it.
2477960	2481920	And so we've had a really, really good time.
2482360	2488600	And I've, I've really kind of gotten into the lore of it now.
2488600	2495040	I'm at the problem right now where I think it will run a Windows 11 ARM because it's an x64 game.
2496000	2508720	But I'm afraid that the the cheat anti cheat on it won't run like I'm having that same problem with VHS and Dead by Daylight through Steam.
2508720	2519400	So I'm, that's why I haven't bought it, but I've watched like playthroughs and everything and the cast in this game is absolutely amazing.
2519720	2522560	Like, I'm just gonna say Ted Raimi's in it and leave it at that.
2522560	2523080	Mic drop.
2524200	2528080	Grace Zebrowski, Laura Palmer's mom is in it.
2528080	2534480	And like I told Shane, I'm like, if you led with that, I would have bought this game day one, because he's been trying to get me to play it.
2535080	2536640	Halston Sage is in it.
2536640	2541040	She she had her the the Dazzler cameo in X-Men Dark Phoenix.
2542040	2544200	The kid from Detective Pikachu, isn't it?
2544240	2547360	Yeah, he played he plays Ryan, the one that people either hate or love.
2547400	2548080	Yeah, yeah.
2549120	2551000	But also Lin Shaye is in it.
2551000	2556840	She was the the elderly woman in the grudge at the beginning of the movie.
2557280	2560920	And she was the psychic in the insidious movies.
2563080	2564120	David Arquette.
2564800	2565320	Mm hmm.
2566040	2572520	Yeah, and like Bobby said this, the other thing I didn't mention is that Halston Sage was also in Orville.
2575240	2577920	But I mean, we've got some like, really good.
2579200	2581520	Really, really good people in it.
2581520	2592200	And I'm actually going to try to confirm something real quick because Mark Silverman plays the near yep, Mark Silverman is the biggest person.
2593200	2597480	The biggest voice mimic for Rod Serling.
2600280	2610280	And when I was listening to the tutorial parts of it, I was like, holy shit, that totally sounds like like, like, you know, Rod Serling.
2610280	2616040	And I was like, I bet it's that guy who does his voice in all of the things like for Tower of Terror.
2616040	2617520	So it was him.
2618520	2619480	It was absolutely him.
2619480	2620160	How funny.
2621040	2622520	And I absolutely love that.
2622520	2624920	They've got like and Brenda Song.
2625520	2626040	Oh, yeah.
2626040	2626520	Hello.
2626520	2627040	Yeah.
2627480	2641080	But like, it's funny, though, how many of these people were in, like, were Disney actors, and then went on to be like in various scary movies.
2641080	2651560	Like we had the guy that played Dylan was in Halloween in the twenty eighteen Halloween, the guy who played Nick as in Star Trek, Picard, we have a lot of oh, and Lance Henriksen is in it.
2651560	2652560	I mean, oh, wow.
2652560	2654200	Can you can you get much cooler?
2654200	2659440	But that's I mean, it just goes to show like how well Until Dawn did that the studio now has.
2659440	2666920	I mean, you know, Until Dawn had what's her name from Heroes, who plays Kirby and scream Hayden Penta near.
2666920	2671320	I don't know if I'm right, but that was like the biggest name that was in that Until Dawn.
2671320	2672520	And now they're getting a lot.
2672520	2684680	I mean, just because either the budget got bigger or the game, you know, because y'all might remember or not, Until Dawn exceeded expectations big time because they really did not market that game.
2684680	2693280	And I don't know if it's because of streaming or what the strong word of mouth, but that game did very, very well where it was all of a sudden like, whoa, there needs to be a franchise here.
2693280	2694840	And so there was the Medal of Adan.
2694840	2700360	But this is like the first true like follow up that is very, very similar to Until Dawn.
2700360	2708400	The one thing is that all these articles that have Ted Raimi listed, they mention Evil Dead, they mention Spider-Man, but they forget his most important role.
2708400	2709400	Jock, sir.
2709400	2710400	Hello.
2710400	2712400	Oh, right.
2712400	2713400	Right.
2713400	2722400	So at any rate, though, there's another little bit of interesting trivia about this, and that is that the game is a little bit different from the original game, but it's a little bit different from the original game.
2722520	2746520	And I would say that the game was, well, I don't know if it's a rumor or if it was based on different, the fact that Google had a partnership with Supermassive, the publisher, or sorry, the developer, but apparently the quarry was supposed to be on Stadia.
2746640	2752640	Because of those developments that happen with the in-house production for different things that fell through the cracks.
2752640	2760640	There's also supposed to be the game High on Life was supposed to, they were, both of them were associated.
2760640	2768640	They were associated by partnership, but never officially associated with Stadia.
2768760	2780760	Supermassive was looking for a publishing partner when the project came to completion, but it ended up, it didn't get released on it.
2780760	2788760	Now, if it had been released on Stadia, I would have paid full fucking price for this and any DLC or whatever would have happened.
2788760	2790760	This would have been mine.
2790880	2797880	They've reached out for comment on it, but, you know, no one's really said anything.
2797880	2804880	And I mean, it's not like Stadia hasn't had some really big games. I mean, they got Resident Evil Village, you know.
2804880	2805880	Right.
2805880	2809880	They have Elder Scrolls Online, they got Mortal Kombat 11.
2809880	2813880	I'm still getting some pretty big titles on there. It's far from dead.
2814000	2818000	So I can be hopeful.
2818000	2823000	Although, I'm going to go ahead and just say this now since I mentioned Capcom.
2823000	2827000	A Resident Evil Village is coming to Mack and fall.
2827000	2829000	Oh, cool.
2829000	2830000	Yep.
2830000	2843000	Apparently the new Metal and the M2 chip when it comes out is more than capable of actually playing games better than a lot of modern graphics cards.
2843120	2845120	And a lot of modern PCs.
2845120	2849120	So I might have to upgrade.
2849120	2850120	All right.
2850120	2852120	Well, that's it for your gaming week.
2852120	2855120	Let's go over to Loki and talk about your gaming week, Loki.
2855120	2862120	It's been very busy with Minecraft still, but I just started Channel 64 season two.
2862120	2868120	So we all kicked that off last night and last afternoon, I guess.
2868120	2870120	But it's been all day.
2870240	2874240	So very excited to get started making content on there.
2874240	2877240	And then this week's going to be busy with making content as well.
2877240	2881240	I took the week off from work to focus on content stuff.
2881240	2884240	So I'm going to see what I can come up with.
2884240	2885240	I've already done a lot.
2885240	2887240	So I got to go through a ton of footage.
2887240	2890240	Early game is always very hard to make content around.
2890240	2895240	At least structured content because it's kind of all over the place and you don't know what's going to happen.
2895240	2899240	So it takes a long time to edit, unfortunately.
2899360	2902360	But I'm confident that I'll be able to put some stuff out.
2902360	2905360	And I got to do some more of my hardcore series as well.
2905360	2908360	So yeah, lots of stuff coming out.
2908360	2909360	All right.
2909360	2912360	Well, best of luck with those videos and all that.
2912360	2915360	So looking forward to seeing the Minecraft content you put out.
2915360	2918360	And I know things have been getting bigger for you over on YouTube a little bit.
2918360	2919360	So congrats.
2919360	2920360	Yeah, a little bit.
2920360	2922360	We're like 460 now, I think.
2922360	2923360	Nice.
2923360	2924360	Almost 500.
2924360	2925360	That's great.
2925360	2928360	Maybe you'll cross 500 in the next week or so, right around the time OLR hits 20.
2928480	2929480	That's awesome.
2929480	2930480	Maybe.
2930480	2931480	Maybe.
2931480	2932480	Cool.
2932480	2933480	All right.
2933480	2934480	Let's see.
2934480	2935480	Moving on.
2935480	2936480	My gaming week.
2936480	2938480	So honestly, most of my week was taken up with a computer transition and just trying
2938480	2942480	to make sure everything would work for tonight and trying to get everything back up and running.
2942480	2944480	I didn't move my drives over.
2944480	2948480	I still have the old computer pretty much put together and I can pull files from it
2948480	2949480	as needed.
2949480	2952480	But for the most part, I just decided to kind of use this as like a fresh start.
2952480	2955480	I didn't want to run the same Windows install or try to do that or anything.
2955480	2957480	So I was just like, you know what, let's just start fresh.
2957600	2961600	And I'll copy over the stuff I need and still have those drives, you know, available if
2961600	2965600	I ever need to pull media off of them like pictures or something like that.
2965600	2968600	So yeah, spending most of my time setting it up.
2968600	2973600	However, you know, of course, I had to bring up Final Fantasy 14 and see how that would
2973600	2974600	run.
2974600	2976600	And it's so smooth.
2976600	2981600	It's like I'm not really playing at a better resolution or anything because I was playing
2981600	2985600	in 4K before, but I definitely noticed the frame rate improvement.
2985720	2990440	And now I'm excited that when I stream, I can actually use the 4K and have it.
2990440	2992440	I can't stream it in 4K.
2992440	2997240	Well, if Twitch allowed me to, I probably do have the computer powerful enough to stream
2997240	3000240	in 4K and I don't have limited bandwidth.
3000240	3005240	So if I was Twitch partner, I probably could stream it at 4K.
3005240	3010320	However, I'm not, I can always do a YouTube maybe, but I'm not really in a hurry to do
3010320	3011320	that.
3011480	3015800	But what I can do is play the game in the full window as opposed to having to size it
3015800	3020280	down just so I can stream it and not have my computer stutter all over the place.
3020280	3021280	So that'd be really nice.
3021280	3023260	I'm looking forward to that for like streaming.
3023260	3028580	So I played a little bit of that this week with Final Fantasy 14, didn't really make
3028580	3029760	any meaningful progress.
3029760	3033320	My paladin is 85, woohoo.
3033320	3036980	And then I also played a little bit of Dead by Daylight, just a little, but I wanted to
3036980	3039600	see how that would look on the new computer.
3039600	3042200	And that one, I mean, Dead by Daylight is a six year old game.
3042200	3043720	We're literally in the six year anniversary event.
3043720	3048040	So it's not like you have this massive 4K mode or anything, but it's nice enough.
3048040	3050880	I definitely noticed again, it's the smoothness.
3050880	3054680	It's a nice enough, and it is, I think a tactical advantage too.
3054680	3058900	I can see things in the background so much better now.
3058900	3062700	And so I can be more aware of things like I can see killers from further away and stuff
3062700	3065420	or make them out better than I could before.
3065420	3069040	So that part is kind of nice in the few games that I played.
3069480	3071600	That's what it's like for me on Stadia.
3071600	3074720	Oh yeah, cause Stadia is already doing the high graphics level processing.
3074720	3075720	Yeah.
3075720	3076720	So that's, that's nice.
3076720	3077720	Yeah.
3077720	3082280	So, yeah, there were definitely like, obviously the new Ninja Turtles game is very much on
3082280	3083280	my radar.
3083280	3087280	Like I'm hearing a lot of positive feedback about that cause that's very much geared at
3087280	3092560	our generation that played that in the pizza parlor, the old Turtles beat them up game.
3092560	3096860	And I have, I see a lot of people going, I wish they do this for the Simpsons.
3096860	3098400	And I think that's a great idea.
3098400	3100160	And what else, am I correct?
3100160	3104840	I believe the studio that made that Shredder's Revenge, I could be wrong, but I thought I
3104840	3109820	heard it's the same studio that did the Dragon Trap remake a couple of years ago.
3109820	3115980	And that was an excellent retro remake that, I mean, like that was like really one of them
3115980	3117320	done really well.
3117320	3118320	Okay.
3118320	3119320	Darktosuya says it's them.
3119320	3120320	Yeah.
3120320	3125720	I can see why this one is getting such positive critiques and the fact that they nailed it
3125720	3129900	because like that dragons, dragon or Wonder Boy, you know what I mean?
3129900	3136000	That game was a very, very good re re-imagining or whatever you want to call it.
3136000	3139160	Something else came out recently too that I wanted to play as well, but I just, you
3139160	3144320	know, I'll have to do it in this next week, but I really, really am hoping I can stream
3144320	3148680	more now because I can stream based off my PC and don't have to rely on the Xbox for
3148680	3150520	everything that's not Final Fantasy.
3150520	3155400	So and the nice thing is the Turtles game, Tunic and all these other games I've been
3155400	3159840	playing, they're on PC as well, so I can just go hog on Game Pass and stream it from
3159840	3160840	the PCs.
3160840	3161840	That'd be nice.
3161840	3166280	So S2100Matt says I'm still running Windows 7 on one machine here.
3166280	3172880	Well, can I point out, Matt, what a long way we've come from the studio that we were in
3172880	3177960	pre-pandemic at my old house where you might recall right before the pandemic happened
3177960	3183000	and we took the show virtual, you might remember I was running a machine that still had Windows
3183000	3184000	XP.
3184000	3187280	I almost said Windows 95, but it was Windows XP.
3187280	3188720	We're still running on that machine.
3188720	3195080	So and now my how far we've come in that short amount of time, relatively, I've gone from
3195080	3197980	an XP machine to 10 to now 11.
3197980	3200920	Now I'm ahead of a lot of people.
3200920	3203400	So yeah, tonight's show is on 11 now.
3203400	3205720	So yeah, Tiger Class says it's the new computer running on 11.
3205720	3206720	Yes it is.
3206720	3211880	And the start menu changes are really taking me some getting used to, but otherwise it's
3211880	3212880	fine.
3213680	3218460	Most of it hasn't changed from 10, at least as far as the user experience goes.
3218460	3223600	And that's a good thing in my opinion, like the taskbar stuff enough is a weird enough
3223600	3225680	change is taking me some getting used to.
3225680	3230920	But Jamie, I know you're an Apple device user and you would appreciate the insight that
3230920	3233360	my husband made on this whole thing.
3233360	3237400	After the first time he used Windows 11 and he said, you know, every new version of Windows,
3237400	3239880	they're just making it more and more like Mac OS.
3239880	3245640	I figured you'd appreciate that comment.
3245640	3246640	All right.
3246640	3249400	Um, Dr. C says it's not like eight.
3249400	3250400	Is it?
3250400	3251400	Oh no, it's nothing like eight.
3251400	3252400	They eight.
3252400	3255000	The reason why eight flopped is that eight was tried.
3255000	3260220	They tried to bring the tablet experience to a desktop didn't work.
3260220	3262520	So no, it's, it's not like eight at all.
3262520	3264120	So but 11 is fine.
3264120	3266200	Tiger class says you can change it to look more like 10.
3266200	3267200	Oh shit.
3267200	3268200	Maybe I need to do that.
3268200	3275560	The look of 11, but it's, I can, it's either or so anyway, let's move on.
3275560	3279800	Let's talk about some more news and, uh, we'd actually don't have a lot of headlines tonight.
3279800	3280800	I have to be honest.
3280800	3282800	We're about half the usual headlines.
3282800	3286800	So it could end up being a shorter show, but we talked about morbid shit for an hour.
3286800	3288360	So I don't know.
3288360	3291040	What do you expect here to LR, but we'll get into our first story.
3291040	3294160	I should say though, sorry, Logie.
3294160	3302200	I should officially say 20 comma O L R next week, the 20th anniversary of orange launch
3302200	3303200	radio.
3303200	3305500	This show started June 23rd, 2002.
3305500	3306500	It scrolls along the bottom.
3306500	3308160	You've probably seen it.
3308160	3313000	So we're celebrating 20 years on the air next week.
3313000	3315840	I don't have confetti cannons.
3315840	3317420	There is a cute little announcement.
3317420	3321960	There is a fan project that's been worked on and I'm going to tell you more about that
3321960	3322960	next week.
3323400	3326320	Uh, that's one little, so an announcement of an announcement.
3326320	3327640	Yes, I just did that.
3327640	3330720	So there will be a little something cute to look forward to otherwise.
3330720	3331720	You know what?
3331720	3335640	I'm just hoping we hear from some people we haven't heard from in a long time.
3335640	3337880	That's always the fun about hitting a big anniversary show.
3337880	3340620	I would love to hear from some people we haven't heard from from a long time.
3340620	3341620	Don't forget.
3341620	3342620	We have an email bag.
3342620	3343620	Participate at orange launch radio.com.
3343620	3344620	Twitter.
3344620	3346720	You need to get some cake at O L R.
3346720	3347720	I would love some cake.
3347720	3350240	Are you going to bring me some cake?
3350240	3352880	You can come over and have cake.
3352880	3355880	All right.
3355880	3357120	Now we can get him to some news.
3357120	3359040	So Loki, why don't you start us off?
3359040	3360920	Got some great news.
3360920	3367120	Activision has investigated themselves and they found no evidence that they've ignored
3367120	3368400	harassment.
3368400	3369520	And you know what?
3369520	3371400	I think I can trust them.
3371400	3376520	Activision, the company that's totally trustworthy to investigate themselves.
3376520	3381240	Because if you were guilty, I mean, you would totally be honest about all the guilty things
3381240	3382240	that you did.
3382240	3385200	You wouldn't just like say, oh, we didn't do that.
3385200	3389360	Oh, I didn't see all that evidence over there.
3389360	3391640	So case closed.
3391640	3396760	I mean, I guess the gaming industry is great now.
3396760	3397760	Harassment's dead.
3397760	3399400	We've solved it.
3399400	3402400	Activision's done it.
3402400	3406080	Oh, no.
3406080	3411600	So we were so close this time.
3411600	3416560	Mike Defton Chat says, I trust ABK with that investigation as much as I trust Riot with
3416560	3417560	theirs.
3417560	3418560	Facts.
3418560	3427480	I mean, congratulations on your internal investigations showing nothing when your employees have told
3427480	3430880	you there is something.
3430880	3432800	What's the problem here?
3432800	3441040	You've put together this whole, you know, show theatrics to try to prove your own employees
3441040	3444040	wrong?
3444040	3447380	They're just proving how well they've ignored the problem.
3447380	3453160	So they've ignored it so well that they can't see the problem anymore.
3453160	3454920	I hope and I don't think it will.
3454920	3457120	I mean, here's reality.
3457120	3460000	Activision may have cleared itself of an internal investigation.
3460000	3464640	Let us not forget how this whole thing started.
3464640	3469900	State of California is doing its own investigation into what's going on.
3469900	3476600	So there's still an external investigation pending, and that's the one that means something.
3476600	3482360	And don't they think that publishing results like this is really poor form?
3482360	3483360	Yeah.
3483360	3484840	And I saw you just agree with this comment.
3484840	3487880	I was about to read too, which hello to a VO by Kurt.
3487880	3488880	Kurt, good to see you.
3488880	3494720	Who says in chat, even if their investigations are real and whatnot, the optics alone are
3494720	3496500	the worst PR.
3496500	3497500	So short-sighted.
3497500	3505880	Very that, very that is that why have this whole press release and trout out this, this
3505880	3510800	should have been an internal PowerPoint.
3510800	3512840	And that's it.
3512840	3519520	It should not be a talking point or a bragging point or a dismissing your employees concerns
3519520	3526080	point, which is what it's turning into.
3526080	3533920	I think that's that chat comment is spot on is that it's terrible optics, even if they
3533920	3537320	think they're doing nothing wrong.
3537320	3543280	So we'll see what the external investigation, because if the external investigation finds
3543280	3548520	stuff, which it already has for this to be in the news in the first place, the fact that
3548520	3552800	the internal investigation shows nothing is just going to show that the internal investigation
3552800	3555040	was full of garbage.
3555040	3558920	And now Activision gets to own that.
3558920	3563300	The only investigation that's going to matter is the external.
3563300	3564300	Exactly that.
3564300	3566800	So, all right.
3566800	3572000	Let's move on and talk about, we talked earlier in the show about some announcements that
3572000	3578800	came out of Square regarding Final Fantasy 7, but let's talk about the next story, which
3578800	3582640	has to do with Capcom stuff.
3582640	3590120	So Capcom did their own press event this week and sorry, I'm having problems on the technical
3590120	3593800	end for whatever reason, the bar doesn't want to advance.
3593800	3594800	Okay.
3594800	3595800	That's weird.
3595800	3603240	So talking about Capcom, they've had a little announcement of their own, of a few things,
3603240	3607680	including what Dark Sakura just addressed earlier is that Resident Evil is kind of expanding
3607680	3614300	and we have Resident Evil Village is coming to Stadia, but we also got some new versions,
3614300	3615300	if you will.
3615300	3616300	It's already on Stadia.
3616300	3617300	Oh, sorry.
3617300	3624820	It's already launched on Stadia, but Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 are getting a minor update.
3624860	3630380	They're not new, they're basically like free upgrades, if you will, to be next gen compatible
3630380	3634700	for PlayStation 5, Xbox series, and PC and so forth.
3634700	3639320	So that is a free next gen upgrade, then that came out.
3639320	3643500	There will be a gold edition expansion for Resident Evil Village.
3643500	3646140	So they are detailing some of that DLC.
3646140	3649020	It will also contain a third person mode.
3649020	3653560	So you can play the game like the old school Resident Evils, if that's more your style,
3653560	3660320	I know Dark Sakura's talked before about how first person can be very, you know, sick
3660320	3661320	inducing.
3661320	3662320	So...
3662320	3666880	Do we get the shirtless mods for Leon and Chris and all them?
3666880	3671880	Always on the internet, but never officially from Capcom.
3671880	3676880	There will also be a story involving Rose and all this comes out just in time for Halloween
3676880	3679340	on October 28th of this year.
3679340	3681680	So that's pretty cool.
3681680	3687700	They also, for whatever reason, they confirmed it after the fact, but they did confirm that
3687700	3691480	Dragon's Dogma 2 is a thing that's going to be happening.
3691480	3697320	Although in the actual press event, they were like, we're celebrating the video, but whatever
3697320	3700480	they did confirm a Dragon's Dogma 2 is coming.
3700480	3704560	That is a game that kind of has grown a lot of fans over the years.
3704560	3707360	So folks will be very happy to hear that.
3707360	3712800	And Monster Hunter Rise has its first, I think expansion, I think it's the first expansion,
3712800	3718080	Sunbreak is coming and there will be a demo for that that's coming out on June 14th.
3718080	3722740	So lots of things going on in Capcom's world for them to have their own little video, which
3722740	3728120	is also interesting considering there was no E3 this year that Capcom kind of did this
3728120	3729120	instead.
3729120	3733080	Now, Capcom was the type of studio that would do their own press event in the past anyway,
3733080	3736680	but it's just interesting how it kind of played out this way when all was said and
3736680	3738560	done after all.
3738560	3746960	So anyway, did anyone watch that and think anything about the Capcom announcements?
3746960	3751980	I watched some of it, but like I was kind of skimming through like a lot of it.
3751980	3753760	I didn't notice the Dragon's Dogma thing.
3753760	3759720	I wasn't, I didn't play the original, but like I was just trying to see if they had
3759720	3760720	new information.
3760720	3764280	It's a lot of it seemed like it was kind of the same stuff, maybe a little bit more
3764280	3771640	expanded of what they already had shown during like the Xbox conference thing or even not
3771640	3776000	so much Xbox, but like during the Summer Games Fest stuff.
3776000	3779080	So I was just, I don't know.
3779080	3782120	Dark to see you in chat says I did like what I saw of Street Fighter 6.
3782120	3783120	You know what?
3783120	3784120	Me too.
3784120	3785120	And I'm just getting that vibe.
3785120	3788120	I'm just getting that vibe that Street Fighter is going to be like Star Trek or like the
3788120	3790200	even numbered ones are the good ones.
3790200	3794480	Not to slander Street Fighter 3 too hard, but let's be real, it wasn't 4 and it wasn't
3794480	3795480	2.
3795480	3797080	Street Fighter 3 3rd Impact was fantastic.
3797080	3798080	Oh yeah.
3798080	3803160	By the time they finally refined it, yeah, it was, it was a lot better, but I don't know.
3803160	3807000	It still didn't land with me the way 4 and 2 do.
3807000	3810860	And then Street Fighter 5, like honestly is like a non-factor to me.
3810860	3811860	I just, I tried it.
3811860	3817320	I played, they gave it away at one point, I was just kind of not into it, but I'm interested
3817320	3818320	in it.
3818320	3821080	I was pissed off the Street Fighter 4 soundtrack was taken down out of Apple Music.
3821080	3822720	Oh, I didn't know that.
3822720	3823720	That's weird.
3823720	3828640	Because it had like some of my favorite versions of the songs.
3828640	3834360	Well you'll just have to turn to piracy or importing or whatever from Japan, I suppose
3834360	3835360	would be the answer.
3835360	3836360	I should say.
3836360	3838040	We'll see how much I care about it.
3838040	3839040	Yeah.
3839040	3840040	All right.
3840040	3841400	Let's move on to some more news.
3841400	3843680	Dark Sakura with some unfortunate news.
3844040	3848520	Well, we have a big womp womp for Halo Infinite.
3848520	3858000	343 Industries had to issue an apology and a change in Halo Infinite for one of their
3858000	3859560	cosmetics that they released.
3859560	3866340	Now today is Juneteenth, it's June 19th, which is the annual commemoration of the end of
3866340	3869880	slavery in the United States.
3869880	3878920	So for Halo Infinite, they released an emblem with, you know, for some reason, it's not
3878920	3882280	showing it, but you know, nice colors and everything.
3882280	3889440	But it was, the palette option was called Bonobo, which is a kind of ape.
3889440	3897880	And whoever let that go, or whoever even named it that in the beginning, need to be fucking
3897880	3906520	fired, saying, but after it was pointed out, they updated the name to be Freedom and the
3906520	3908520	official statement.
3908520	3913100	And this comes from Bonnie Ross, the founder and head.
3913100	3917780	We were made aware of a palette option for our Juneteenth emblem that contained a term
3917780	3919700	that was offensive and hurtful.
3919700	3922840	The team immediately addressed this issue via an update.
3922840	3927640	We are a studio and franchise that is committed to inclusivity where everyone is welcome and
3927640	3929760	supported to be their true selves.
3929760	3935620	On behalf of 343, I apologize for making a celebrated moment a hurtful moment.
3935620	3938580	That actually, I like how that was phrased.
3938580	3940660	I'm glad she took accountability.
3940660	3945740	Like the situation sucks, but I think we all know, Bobby Kotick would have phrased this
3945740	3947180	a lot differently.
3947180	3950620	And I appreciate that she at least, she didn't try to pass the buck.
3950620	3952240	She didn't try to place blame.
3952240	3954440	She said, I'm sorry.
3954440	3957620	And we don't have enough CEOs to say that in this industry.
3957620	3963760	There's also a statement from their community manor, John Junisic, I think is how it's pronounced.
3963760	3968360	We strive to create a diverse and inclusive gaming communities while the original name
3968360	3970580	refers to an internal tool set.
3970580	3975280	It was not intended to be applied to this context and we recognize the harm it may have
3975280	3976280	caused.
3976280	3977280	Yeah.
3977280	3979740	I was gonna say, I thought I had heard somewhere that that name was a reference to an internal
3979740	3983980	tool set, but still, I mean, I'm not, I'm not excusing what happened because you still
3983980	3990900	have to wonder how did it go through all these steps to actually being released without
3990900	3996060	anyone catching that is a yikes.
3996060	4002860	It's not the first time though, that we've seen unfinished items be published or things
4002860	4006160	get published early or the wrong versions of things get published.
4006160	4012300	You know, it, it happens, I mean, in the digital age, it can now be quickly and easily corrected,
4012300	4015980	but still, I, that's a pretty big one.
4015980	4017980	That's a pretty big one.
4017980	4020740	A yikes to say the least.
4020740	4021740	Yeah.
4021740	4027300	Um, but I, I guess if there's anything to be hopeful about, again, at least you can
4027300	4034700	kind of look at, okay, when a shitty situation happens, how does a person react to that?
4034700	4037900	Do they, do they delete their Twitter account, India Farah?
4037900	4045080	Do they, do they do that or do they, um, take accountability and ownership and, you know,
4045080	4046080	and that whole thing.
4046080	4047440	And, and at least she did that.
4047440	4054980	So I'm again, not acute situation, not good, but let's be hopeful that when she says it,
4054980	4059760	it should never happen again, that there is a little bit of substance behind that.
4059760	4060760	We hope.
4060760	4061760	Yeah.
4061760	4066820	So, all right, well, moving on Loki.
4066820	4068460	All right.
4068460	4072660	Something the internet and the people of, uh, the gamers won't be accountable for is
4072660	4074700	this, but we'll, we'll talk about this.
4074700	4080060	Well, people are not happy with Diablo immortal, um, especially after seeing Diablo four and
4080060	4087620	how great that looks, um, basically, you know, bombing it on Metacritic as what they do.
4087620	4093660	And so now it is the lowest rated user score or has the lowest rated user score of all
4093660	4101380	time because you know, of their horrible monetization practices with it, it's just
4101380	4102380	very pay to win.
4102380	4109460	So not surprised as what happens, but did you, did you hear the followup from yesterday
4109460	4115420	or today about not, not about Metacritic, but about how well Diablo mortal's doing.
4115420	4116420	Yeah.
4116420	4117420	Yeah.
4117420	4123260	That in the first two weeks they've made, was it $24 million?
4123260	4126140	They've made $24 million in two weeks.
4126140	4127140	Great.
4127140	4129820	And this is why the behavior is never going to change.
4129820	4131740	Great job holding that.
4131740	4136380	Great job dragging this whole thing through the mud, talk and doing these greatest on
4136380	4137380	scores.
4137380	4140540	Here is a fucking wake up call.
4140540	4145980	Those scores on Metacritic do not mean shit.
4145980	4152780	You are wasting your fucking time writing them.
4152780	4157860	That $24 million this game just earned, that's what matters.
4157860	4162740	You fucked up because, and I, you know what, maybe I have to take accountability cause
4162740	4164420	I did say I downloaded the game.
4164420	4165780	I tried it out.
4165780	4171980	I didn't give them any money, but you know, fine.
4171980	4176540	I played into the $8 million figure, but I told you it's complicated for a lot of us
4176540	4181260	because I do know people that worked on that game and deserve to have success even if their
4181260	4184780	managers and higher ups don't.
4184780	4190340	So it's tricky, but I'm just saying this whole Metacritic thing, and this is my point.
4190340	4193620	It doesn't mean shit when this is happening.
4193620	4195580	Like it's, it's a wasted effort.
4195580	4202700	Your Metacritic, your change.orgs will do nothing.
4202700	4205500	You know what you need to do?
4205500	4210820	Stop watching the streamers that are spending $15,000 to tell you something you already
4210820	4211860	know.
4211860	4217180	And all of these other, and you've got to wonder where's this $24 million come from?
4217180	4221740	How many streamers have we heard of that are dumping thousands of dollars into this game?
4221740	4226940	I'm not going to tell you how to spend your money, but where do you think the streamers
4226940	4236260	got that money to do that from you watching them and doing your biddies and your subs?
4236260	4241780	They learned it from you in turn enabled this $24 million.
4241780	4248740	So if you are out there writing these Metacritic reviews and you're watching these streamers
4248740	4253260	at the same time and giving them money so that they in turn can go pay it in Diablo
4253260	4261780	Immortal, you are fucking up.
4261780	4264460	Rob Roberts, your friend, here to tell it to you like it is.
4264460	4267100	Sorry, it's not always cute.
4267100	4274180	teacher Rob Estin Chat says, ah shit, uncle Rob taking them to school.
4274180	4275180	You know what?
4275180	4280460	Sometimes, sometimes you just have to break it down for a bitch.
4280460	4285300	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I saw a video from James Stephanie Sterling on the Diablo Immortal
4285300	4286300	fuckery.
4286300	4289300	Apparently it costs somewhere in the $100,000 range to max your character.
4289300	4297580	Yeah, there was a headline going around about that and, but here's, can I, in, in defense
4297580	4303780	of the frontline workers who worked hard on Diablo Immortal, who maybe had nothing to
4303780	4307160	do with this whole pay to win scheme.
4307160	4315020	Is that, do you have to have the best of the best equipment to enjoy the game?
4315020	4317580	Because I've played, I mean, I haven't installed it on the new computers.
4317580	4322140	I haven't really touched it this week, but like I played a good five, six hours without
4322140	4326740	dropping a dime on the game and I relatively enjoyed myself.
4326740	4331020	I heard once you get to the end game, you're really, really pressured to spend more money.
4331020	4332020	I might.
4332260	4336340	No, I probably won't actually like if I've gone this long without, yeah, I probably not
4336340	4337340	going to do it.
4337340	4338340	I'm not going to.
4338340	4340220	And especially, you know, hearing these stories about how much it takes, I'm not going to
4340220	4342300	do it.
4342300	4347160	Like how hard is it to just not give it money?
4347160	4351340	And before I understand, there's this whole thing on social media about it's enabling
4351340	4354460	gambling addiction and it's enabling all this.
4354460	4355460	Okay.
4355460	4360720	At some point you have to take personal accountability for that type of shit.
4360720	4367000	And if that is a trap for you, then you have to not walk in that, that could be many games
4367000	4369600	out there, not just Diablo Immortal.
4369600	4371800	Many games are doing this exact same thing.
4371800	4377700	So I sort of find that argument to be a little bit, but I just, there, there is a way to
4377700	4383160	enjoy this game and play the game and not spend money.
4383160	4386440	And DJ Ramesh says, if you need to spend money to beef up your character to beat the game,
4386440	4387440	is it really worth playing?
4387440	4388440	I would say no.
4388440	4390280	And that's the point where I would stop.
4390280	4391280	Yeah.
4391280	4396160	Bonstablo 6 says, I cannot wrap my head around paying and paying and paying to play a game
4396160	4398440	or games in general.
4398440	4406440	You know, I pay a monthly fee to play Final Fantasy 14 online and I don't regret it whatsoever.
4406440	4410540	I pay money to dress up the survivors I don't play in Dead by Daylight.
4410540	4414060	So on one hand, you have to spend money on the stuff that makes you happy.
4414060	4420420	I feel that what I'm paying is justified because I know what I'm getting.
4420420	4423460	And that's a big difference from this Diablo Immortal situation.
4423460	4427780	And even when Jamie's talking about playing dress up, she knows what she's getting.
4427780	4432240	And these games, both Dead by Daylight and Final Fantasy, they continue to support with
4432240	4434900	regular updates and so forth that I feel like I'm paying into.
4434900	4437420	I think it's, you know, it's, it's that whole thing.
4437420	4438420	Yeah.
4438420	4440180	DJ Ramesh says, I'll pay to remove the ads from the game.
4440180	4442760	Def says, I'll pay the Pokemon Unite Battle Pass.
4442760	4446840	No one is here to tell you how you should spend your money.
4446840	4454420	But if it costs, I mean, if the odds in Diablo are that shitty to get these items, you kind
4454420	4456380	of have to just say no at some point.
4456380	4458920	You really do.
4458920	4462120	And Prince Brightstar in chat says, or the government just outright bans it.
4462120	4464440	There are certain countries where people can't play it.
4464440	4472060	And honestly, I think I'm surprised that Blizzard is not required to publish the odds.
4472060	4477940	And I think it's just a matter of time before this game gets in front of the lawmakers that
4477940	4478940	need to see it.
4478940	4481740	And we're going to see that become a law, at least in some states.
4481740	4485380	The government is slow, but it's going to happen.
4485380	4486380	Mark my word.
4486380	4490940	This game, this game, Diablo Immortal, is going to cause states to pass laws where the
4490940	4495380	odds have to be transparent.
4495380	4498140	The government doesn't do a lot, but it'll do that.
4498140	4499780	All right.
4500680	4503980	As Joe and Hunter Matt wants to point out, also keep in mind that some streamers are
4503980	4508840	also paid by the devs with in-game currency to spend to make these loot box videos.
4508840	4513380	The logic behind it is that if a streamer inspires a viewer to possibly buy into the
4513380	4516780	game and its loot boxes, they see it as solid advertising.
4516780	4519820	EA does this with ultimate team streamers.
4519820	4523220	It's all that influencer presence.
4523220	4528460	Because it's also, and this is important, it's also not unique to gaming.
4528500	4536380	For example, I have a friend who is a drag influencer, and this person got sent a makeup
4536380	4542100	kit from a makeup company to do an unboxing video on Instagram and show off all the makeup
4542100	4544420	to their Instagram followers.
4544420	4550440	It is the exact same thing, but with makeup.
4550440	4559720	I get mobile game invites for betas.
4559720	4565120	So I just all want you to remember, your Diablo Immortal $15,000 spending streams is just
4565120	4566120	makeup.
4566120	4567120	Remember.
4567120	4570080	Hey, makeup's great.
4570080	4572760	Like you know what?
4572760	4573760	You know, I'm not-
4573760	4574760	Mine is.
4574760	4575760	Yes, your makeup is great.
4575960	4581360	I know there's been a lot, I think in 2022 we've come a long way with some of these stereotypes,
4581360	4584280	but even for guys, you know what?
4584280	4586880	A little foundation will cover up a lot of stuff.
4586880	4588920	Nail polish, kind of cool.
4588920	4590720	Like a lot of rock stars use it.
4590720	4594060	It's not what it used to be, so anyway.
4594060	4595920	The guy liner must return.
4595920	4596920	I know, right?
4596920	4598480	I kind of miss guy liner.
4598480	4602440	Quest Buster says, I had to dig to find the odds on drops in Diablo Immortal and found
4602440	4604640	out about its version of a pity system.
4604640	4608640	In comparison, a gotcha like Genshin Impact literally provides the odds up front for their
4608640	4609640	banners.
4609640	4610640	Yep.
4610640	4611640	Yep.
4611640	4612640	All right, let's move on.
4612640	4618920	Let's talk about a game instead that, you know, isn't going to be a nickel and dime
4618920	4619920	thing.
4619920	4620920	At least I don't think it is.
4620920	4622180	I'd be very depressed if it was.
4622180	4626240	This is actually a game called Atari Vault, or I'm sorry, excuse me, Atari Mania.
4626240	4628040	Atari Vault was a former collection.
4628040	4630960	Atari Mania is a collection that was just announced.
4630960	4639160	It's 150 micro games that are incorporating the 1970s and 80s classic Atari games.
4639160	4645560	It's going to be coming out on Switch, PC via Steam, and the Atari VCS, remember that?
4645560	4648960	Finally, it has a game that, you know, but okay.
4648960	4651800	But it's coming out on Steam and Switch, and let's be real, that's where most of you are
4651800	4653520	going to check it out.
4653520	4656600	And it's waiting for them to celebrate Atari's 50th anniversary.
4656600	4661880	Now here's the thing, I gotta say, in actually looking at the game a little bit, and let
4661880	4665520	me see if I can pull this up, at least for the Twitch viewers here.
4665520	4670920	Let me do a quick little presto change-o on my new setup here to show you what this
4670920	4671920	looks like.
4671920	4675300	I'm sorry, this is a great technical breakthrough.
4675300	4681720	Your boxes don't go gray anymore when I switch because you're on the Discord app, I'm sorry.
4681720	4685200	I know none of you know what I'm talking about, but I just had a very exciting technical breakthrough
4685200	4686200	on this side.
4686200	4691160	Anyway, but my point is, here we go, on the other screen, this is what the Atari Classics
4691160	4693640	look like now in this game.
4693640	4697020	So they've, even though we're talking, like that was Yars' Revenge, hold on, let me go
4697020	4698120	back in the video there.
4698120	4702960	That was very clearly, that here, see that, even though it's a little faded, and sorry
4702960	4707440	for the folks in the podcast feed, but we're looking at Yars' Revenge, but with very clearly
4707440	4709720	some different and upgraded graphics.
4709720	4715360	So it's not just that they're, again, repackaging all of their old shit and putting it out,
4715360	4719680	they're actually reimagining a lot of these things, and that part is kind of interesting,
4719680	4720680	I actually think.
4720680	4723200	Like NES Remix, but Atari?
4723200	4729520	Yeah, kinda, or actually it's NES Remix meets WarioWare meets Atari, because these are micro
4729520	4730800	games, they're saying.
4730800	4734220	See, that's how they should be doing that kind of stuff.
4734220	4735360	That's the way to do it.
4735360	4737280	That's like the Namco approach almost.
4737280	4741880	That's why this actually kind of caught my attention, because I was like, wait a minute,
4741880	4743860	this is different.
4743860	4748740	And what is also kind of neat about this is that you have the mashup games, they also
4748740	4755900	say it is a neo-retro art update to the classic Atari 2600 style, and you can do fully playable
4755900	4761860	versions in the treasure trove of these remastered Atari classics that you unlock by completing
4761860	4764860	cheeky challenges, that's how you know it's a British dev.
4764860	4770180	It's cheeky challenges that you will complete to do this.
4770180	4775620	So it caught my attention, because you know I love retro shit, my only thing about this
4775620	4781780	is I'm like, this game, honestly, is like 15 years late.
4781780	4783980	This game is 15 years late.
4783980	4788620	This should have been, like somebody is really late to the party, but alright, they finally
4788620	4792900	figured out that something like this could be pretty big, so I wish them luck, I really
4792900	4793900	really do.
4793900	4799620	So, yeah, let's see, Tigerclass says, I remember that remake of Yars Revenge that wasn't like
4799620	4803180	the original, it was the game with the name Yars Revenge slapped on it.
4803180	4809020	That was just Atari selling their IP for a quick buck, because they were otherwise financially
4809020	4810060	insolvent.
4810060	4812100	So that's all that was.
4812100	4815060	They did it with Centipede, I think it's or Millipede or one of them.
4815060	4818500	Dartisius says, I did pick up the other Atari collection on Switch, but this sounds a lot
4818500	4819500	more fun.
4819500	4823700	Yeah, it's a little jazzed up, and it's a little kind of revisiting those games.
4823700	4829820	And if you think about it, those Atari 2600 games were kind of micro games.
4829820	4832540	They were very repetitive.
4832540	4838620	That's kind of the charm and the zen of them, in my opinion, but video games were very different
4838620	4846940	when you only had, what, what does 4K translate into, 4,092 characters to code with?
4846940	4851060	Yeah, your games got a little repetitive, because you only had so much space to actually
4851060	4855660	code with, and they had to do some really clever things to make things fit in that much
4855660	4856660	space.
4856660	4857660	So.
4857660	4858660	All right.
4858660	4863140	Anyway, before we get to our next story, I see Dark Sakura commenting, Loki, on your
4863140	4866840	video and some of the characters there, like Deepcoat.
4866840	4869160	And I didn't- It's hilarious that it's Deepcoat.
4869160	4872620	I didn't ask in the beginning of the show, like I usually do, because I was too distracted
4872620	4874780	by having to run things tonight.
4874780	4877120	What is the game playing behind you live on Twitch tonight?
4877120	4879060	It's Fashion Police Squad.
4879060	4880060	Oh.
4880060	4883020	I think you got Captain Jack hanging out there.
4883020	4884020	That's funny.
4884020	4885020	Okay.
4885020	4886020	It looks pretty awesome.
4886020	4887200	I want to check that out.
4887200	4890220	I would take it that Deepcoat is supposed to be a reference to Deepthroat.
4890220	4891220	Oh, I'm sure.
4891220	4892220	I'm sure.
4892220	4893220	Yeah.
4893220	4894220	But that Fashion Police- Look at the history, people.
4894220	4895220	Looked funny.
4895220	4898600	Fashion Police is the first person shooter, but it's, you're literally the Fashion Police,
4898600	4903860	so I mean- It's like Doom, but you're, you know, basically running around and shooting
4903860	4907820	people to make them, you know, more fashionable.
4907820	4908820	Yes.
4908820	4910660	You're shooting them with style.
4910660	4913220	Dark Soccer, one of us needs to play this on stream, or both of us.
4913220	4914220	It's like fun.
4914220	4915220	All right.
4915220	4916220	We'll see.
4916220	4917220	We'll see.
4917220	4918220	All right.
4918220	4919220	Let's move on.
4919220	4920220	Dark Soccer, we can go to you.
4920220	4922020	Well, how about like super cool games?
4922020	4927580	Like one of my favorite series is the Raiden series.
4927580	4934020	And Limited Run Games, bless them, is doing physical releases, actually a combined physical
4934020	4942500	release of Raiden 4 x Mikado Remix and Raiden 5 Director's Cut Duel.
4942500	4950500	It's actually the- The Duel Pack is what they're all called together, but anyway, it is like
4950500	4958820	two of the- I mean, honestly, to me, the pinnacle of the series was Raiden DX Deluxe, but still.
4958820	4963180	But even so, I think it's really awesome that this is coming out.
4963180	4969540	They are available separately in the Nintendo eShop, but if you like physical copies and
4969540	4978100	one of both, the orders are up for the games as of June 21st, which is two days from today
4978100	4981940	for us here on Sunday, so that'll be Tuesday.
4981940	4991260	The price will be $49.99 US, and it's honestly, I mean, it's a write-in game.
4991260	4992480	How could you go wrong?
4992480	4998560	And also, Raiden 5 Director's Cut had like a cheer attack in it that I thought was kind
4998560	5004840	of interesting, and voice acting in the series.
5004840	5011640	So some pretty neat stuff in there, but I mean, come on, you know the weapon everybody
5011640	5014920	wants in the Raiden games?
5014920	5017200	The electric thing.
5017200	5020640	That is the coolest weapon that exists.
5020640	5025200	Did I ever tell you about the time I beat Raiden on PlayStation while I was drunk on
5025200	5026200	Everclear?
5026200	5027200	No.
5027200	5032840	Well, you remember also at my birthday party at Dave & Buster's, when I was playing Luminess
5032840	5037120	and got to like level 30-something, very drunk.
5037120	5042100	I don't know what it is, but if I'm like super inebriated like that, I will either completely
5042100	5047840	bomb something or kick so much ass at it, because I think I'm playing just like on instinct.
5048040	5054400	That night, after many shots of Everclear, I beat Raiden on PlayStation.
5054400	5055600	I don't know how.
5055600	5057380	It was magic.
5057380	5059580	Magical Everclear.
5059580	5060580	It certainly was.
5060580	5061580	Please drink responsibly.
5061580	5063000	I felt like it was magic.
5063000	5069240	My liver might not have, and also that was the, was it that night or the one in Ocean
5069240	5070240	Sweets?
5070240	5072040	But anyway, it was like, I think that was one of the nights I learned that I can't get
5072040	5073040	a hangover.
5073040	5074040	Huh.
5074040	5075040	All right.
5075240	5076240	All right.
5076240	5078040	Well, I thought I thought you'd enjoy that story.
5078040	5079040	Dark Sakura.
5079040	5080040	It seems.
5080040	5081040	Yeah, I did.
5081040	5084040	I linked it to Dan right away, because why wouldn't we have this?
5084040	5089440	I mean, probably because we are oh, I need to take a tangent.
5089440	5090440	OK, it's fine.
5090440	5092440	We have room for that tonight.
5092440	5093440	Yeah.
5093440	5094440	So Dan sold Mustang.
5094440	5095440	Oh, shit.
5095440	5096440	I didn't know that.
5096440	5097440	Oh, wow.
5097440	5098440	OK.
5098440	5099440	He sold it to a friend.
5099440	5100440	Keep it in the family.
5100440	5102800	And he has started working on converting our garage to a game room.
5102800	5106760	I was like, you needed the room in the garage for more pinball machines that badly where
5106760	5108360	he finally sold the Mustang.
5108360	5111440	Well, I want I want them out of the living room for sure.
5111440	5114880	I mean, I'd like to actually be able to, you know, go back to doing my weightlifting in
5114880	5115880	the living room.
5115880	5116880	Uh huh.
5116880	5129040	But he he's already looking into sound tiles to to lay out in it and in the shape of one
5129040	5130400	of the Space Invaders.
5130400	5133720	Oh, I love that.
5133720	5138680	And looking into like carpeting options, like I saw some things on our Amazon view list
5138680	5140960	because Dan and I share our Amazon account.
5140960	5143840	That's so you get to have a garage arcade.
5143840	5147320	Loki gets to have a garage arcade with his DDR machine.
5147320	5148320	My age.
5148320	5149320	You have a garage.
5149320	5150320	Yeah.
5150320	5152640	My HOA rules force us to park the cars in the garage.
5152640	5154200	So whomp.
5154200	5156080	But that's why I you know what?
5156080	5157080	I have my own office.
5157080	5159800	And I said, what you don't see on cam.
5159800	5160800	I'll show it.
5160800	5164000	I'm it's not going to look as good on stream, but I'm thinking about it.
5164000	5170680	I have a big walk in closet right to the side of where the machine is.
5170680	5174840	And it would hold about four or five of those arcade one ups very nicely.
5174840	5177960	It's actually a full on like you can walk in there and stuff.
5177960	5179840	So I'm actually a little bit bigger than mine.
5179840	5180840	Yeah.
5180840	5183740	I'm thinking about moving the cabinets in there, even though it might not make as good
5183740	5186480	of a background for when I'm streaming and stuff.
5186480	5188520	I think that would be fun.
5188720	5194200	I'll tell you what one of my friends does with her walk in closet, who's also a podcaster.
5194200	5198600	She converted her closet completely to a studio.
5200920	5201920	Oh.
5201920	5202920	With sound tiles.
5202920	5203920	Oh yeah.
5203920	5204920	Because lights and things.
5204920	5205920	It's so yeah.
5205920	5206920	Noise dampening in there.
5206920	5207920	Yeah.
5207920	5208920	Yeah.
5208920	5209920	It's not a bad idea.
5209920	5210920	Yeah.
5210920	5211920	It would be easy to do.
5211920	5216280	I mean, you could even, you know, if you really got, you know, interested in it, you could
5216280	5219120	paint like whatever backdrop chroma key green.
5219120	5220120	Yeah.
5220120	5225440	Cause I was going to say that works well for a podcast only, but for doing the video stuff,
5225440	5229080	it's not the most engaging background and less, but it sounds like your friend kind
5229080	5231360	of did some work arounds to make it better.
5231360	5236800	So that's why you have like, you know, lights hanging from the door or, you know, neat little
5236800	5238520	sign behind you.
5238520	5239520	Yeah.
5239520	5240520	Anything is possible.
5240520	5241520	True.
5241520	5242520	True.
5242520	5243520	Yeah.
5243520	5244520	All right.
5244760	5249080	I'm going to be your fashion expert, your interior decorator for decorating closet.
5249080	5250960	So you're going to play fashion police IRL.
5250960	5252960	No, I'm not going to be a police.
5252960	5254760	I'm not going to like shoot people with style.
5254760	5255760	Oh, okay.
5255760	5258360	I'm just going to be like, you could do better.
5258360	5259360	Okay.
5259360	5264840	Girl, if you're going to be in the closet, at least make sure the closet is pretty.
5264840	5266640	Some good advice here on pride month.
5266640	5267640	All right.
5267640	5273320	Let's move on to our next story, Logie.
5274520	5282040	So Nintendo has now been striking down YouTube musicians who have been covering different
5282040	5285320	tracks of Nintendo's properties.
5285320	5294040	So one of one person that got a strike recently or was Cinemax, who is a child dedicated music
5294040	5300080	and he was creating he was doing some covers of some Metroid Prime songs.
5300080	5304160	And apparently that got their attention, which is weird because like I've seen a lot of other
5304160	5307360	like, I mean, there's so many like Nintendo remixes.
5307360	5313200	I'm surprised they haven't gone after like, you know, some of these other remix sites
5313200	5314200	and stuff.
5314200	5320160	But apparently, you know, they're sending copyright claims, you know, they have the
5320160	5324760	legal right to take the content down and, you know, Cinemax acknowledges that the songs
5324760	5327680	are owned and copyrighted by Nintendo.
5327680	5334780	However, you know, doesn't really agree with their aggressive tactics for like kind of
5334780	5343080	treating like the fans and people that make fan creations based off of some of their IP.
5343080	5345680	So this I found very interesting.
5345680	5350040	So Bobby got into this on his show tonight and he's in chat kind of reinforcing some
5350040	5352240	of the same stuff he got into on his show.
5352240	5357640	And I thought he made a damn good point about this whole story is he said that in the story
5357640	5361720	that the person who got the copyright claim or whatever said they were called by Nintendo's
5361720	5365680	lawyers to take him down.
5365680	5368240	We have to stop and think about that statement for a minute.
5368240	5372220	Since when have Nintendo's lawyers ever talked to people on the phone?
5372220	5374480	And I guess it's never they're not going to do that.
5374480	5381260	They're not going to do that because if it's legal, they have to have proof that it happened.
5381260	5385600	And the way that there's you can't prove a phone conversation because recording recorded
5385600	5388840	conversations are not a miserable evidence.
5388840	5394320	The proof is a registered or certified letter that is in writing that you mailed to the
5394320	5397320	person or the company or whoever the offending is.
5397320	5400840	That's why it's a cease and desist letter that you always hear.
5400840	5401840	That's why it's the term.
5401840	5403540	It's never a cease and desist phone call.
5403540	5409400	And also with it being in writing from attorney also makes it privileged information.
5409400	5412080	Sorry, I had a little spill here.
5412160	5415560	So Loki, I'm not trying to step on your toes or anything, but I'm pointing out something
5415560	5421200	that's interesting that's happening here with the internet wildfire of this story that's
5421200	5422320	going on.
5422320	5427520	And I get everybody likes to dunk on Nintendo's copyright thing.
5427520	5433040	And they've earned this, that people are able to jump to this conclusion.
5433040	5440260	But something doesn't add up and I'm not, you know, again, I, but I'm not saying, I'm
5440260	5446860	not saying that this person is necessarily lying because somebody else who had a beef
5446860	5452700	with this person could have called posing to be Nintendo's lawyers and doing this whole
5452700	5453700	thing.
5453700	5457500	So I'm not saying this person is necessarily a bad actor at face value.
5457500	5461060	I wouldn't want to say that because then his lawyers could send me a letter accusing me
5461060	5467380	of something, but I'm just saying lawyers don't call people.
5467380	5468700	Something doesn't add up here.
5471260	5473260	It is a little strange.
5473260	5478600	The only remote thing that I could even think of to give it some feasibility is if the guy
5478600	5485060	actually had like a buddy that worked at Nintendo and someone gave him a warning or I don't,
5485060	5490140	that wouldn't even be, that's like the only thing I could remotely think.
5490140	5492060	I can see.
5492060	5493060	Yeah.
5493060	5494980	I don't know if, but I, yeah.
5494980	5499220	And like maybe somebody is doing the phone call as a favor and that whole thing where
5499220	5503100	it's like, it gets translated into, I was told to stop.
5503100	5508580	No, a friend told you, you should stop or else the lawyer's going to get involved.
5508580	5511040	But you took that to here.
5511040	5514300	I got told to stop by the lawyer.
5514300	5517660	Let that, and we all, we can all think of a case in our lives, whether it happened to
5517660	5522060	us or somebody else where that game of telephone absolutely played out.
5522060	5523060	It is really weird though.
5523060	5528300	Cause like I, there's so many, I mean, unless they were really close to like the original
5528300	5533580	pieces of music, I mean, there's so many Nintendo music channels out there that are
5533580	5539900	just like remixes and like, I just, it doesn't make any sense.
5539900	5544580	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, also this cover artist only has about 7K subs, not a big fish
5544580	5545860	in the cover music pond.
5545860	5548260	So this is great for your attention.
5548260	5549260	So yeah.
5549260	5552720	And again, Loki, I'm not, you know, you're, you're just bringing, again, this is a show
5552720	5555300	about video games and video game culture.
5555300	5557200	And this story is everywhere right now.
5558000	5562720	And that's why I'm saying, hold up, tap the break because we do have a tendency sometimes
5562720	5566900	to copy paste these stories, these headlines and things to share on social media without
5566900	5569740	stopping to look and say, does the math add up?
5569740	5573280	Because there's a question mark here.
5573280	5579360	And again, it might not be this, you know, I, it might not be the individual, the cover
5579360	5587000	artist is probably could, could for all we know, completely be accounting the truth as
5587000	5589280	they see it.
5589280	5595560	But as SSJ 100 Matt says in chat, and this is it, nail meathead, if people can swat someone,
5595560	5597720	they can fake a Nintendo lawyer call.
5597720	5602160	Yeah, I mean, it makes sense.
5602160	5607040	So anyway, just something to think about.
5607440	5610760	Let's see, yeah, Mike Defton chat says not to make them less.
5610760	5616480	Yeah, I mean, like, and I will sit here and say, this guy has more subs than our podcast
5616480	5617000	does.
5617000	5619080	So kudos to him on that.
5619800	5622800	There are way bigger remix channels and haven't got struck down or something.
5622800	5623680	Yeah, it's a little weird.
5623680	5629360	Like, why would you go after the little guy unless, unless your video game covers were laced
5629360	5634320	with disparaging comments about Nintendo or something or false accusation?
5634320	5637920	I'm not saying they are, I'm just saying that might be a way that your smaller channel would
5637920	5639000	get more attention.
5639000	5640440	But I don't think that's the case here.
5641360	5646520	So, so you know what I just said, since we're a small podcast, we can say anything we want.
5647280	5649560	I know, just so much freedom.
5653160	5659920	Although the one time we did say something that somebody didn't like, somebody did get a phone
5659920	5662880	call, actually, now that I think about it, but we won't go there.
5663320	5664960	This is a time of celebration.
5667360	5667840	All right.
5668160	5668880	Oh, you.
5669880	5673160	Moving on, let's go to our next story.
5674080	5678280	Oh, this is one that I thought was pretty cool, because this is like a one from the vaults type of
5678280	5678720	story.
5679200	5683240	This is about an unreleased NES prototype that has come to light.
5683440	5685800	It is the game The Fairyland Story.
5685920	5692520	It was originally in arcades in 1985, and now we have found that this was being ported at one
5692520	5698960	point to the NES by Hard Four Games and Forest of Illusion, I think are the ones that actually
5698960	5699840	found this game.
5701160	5703720	But it was going to be released in 86, 87.
5703720	5705880	It had a brief mention in a Japanese magazine.
5706080	5706800	It didn't happen.
5708000	5713520	There were some differences from the arcade game, such as there's only 50 levels in the game
5713520	5716320	instead of 101 and the 50 loop over and over.
5716680	5721680	But what's kind of neat is that this old ROM has been rediscovered.
5722280	5723320	So you can check that out.
5723680	5725640	Also, it should be pointed out.
5725880	5731480	There is this NES original, but if you want to support the real thing, it's also on arcade
5731480	5734400	archives, because you know how Nintendo has that whole arcade.
5734400	5739720	I've seen PlayStation 4 and 5 have it too, is the arcade archives.
5739720	5743080	If you actually want to play the original arcade version, but if you want to play the
5743080	5746160	unreleased version, that ROM is out there on the Internet.
5746280	5749440	It's not hard to find because this story is everywhere right now.
5749520	5753200	But I'll give you a hint, forestdelusion.com is the site that hasn't.
5753440	5755680	So I think it's kind of neat.
5756160	5759920	It's always neat to see games that like we weren't supposed to see.
5761720	5763360	So it's a little piece of gaming history.
5765080	5770360	I might have already gotten the ROM right after it came out.
5771200	5772080	Did you play it yet?
5772560	5773120	No, not yet.
5773680	5777640	I remember I've been playing through a bunch of other stuff, so it's back there.
5777640	5786000	I have a few other prototypes actually that I need to take a look at, like, hold on, I'm
5786000	5788760	actually going to pull up the list of the ones I need to play.
5789640	5801880	But I've got like Bio Force Ape and I have Fairyland, I have Fighting Golf.
5803360	5805960	I have another one called Hattori.
5806960	5815400	So I also have a prototype of Rensaber, Star Soldier prototype for the NES.
5815400	5816320	Random stuff.
5817320	5819640	Yeah, just really, really random.
5820720	5821240	All right.
5821280	5826200	Well, since we brought up classic games, I think it's a great segue into our next segment.
5836880	5844200	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5844600	5847400	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5847520	5853480	But once a month, DarkSakura says, you know what, I'm going to mix it up and pick a classic electronic handheld.
5853480	5855560	So what is the classic handheld of the month?
5856200	5858240	We have a digital monster.
5859240	5872000	Basically, when Bandai released the Tamagotchi, they also released a, you know, just because the Tamagotchi was really marketed more for like girls.
5873000	5881680	So in true gendered, you know, tradition, they released one for the boys called the digital monster or Digimon.
5882680	5887560	It was, you know, it's another type of virtual pet, but this one could be a fighting pet.
5888080	5898600	So you would, you know, raise your pet and then you had these little, like these little connectors at the bottom where your Digimon could battle or more like at the top.
5899000	5901720	But going back to it, let's just start with a little bit of history on it.
5901720	5909680	So it was released by Bandai on June 26, 1997 in Japan and December 5, 1997 in North America.
5909680	5924000	The original digital monster model sold 14 million units worldwide, including 13 million in Japan and 1 million overseas by March 2004.
5926720	5935800	And by 2005, it had, there were more than 24 million digital monster units sold worldwide.
5935800	5948560	In 2017, they did a 20th anniversary edition that was released in Japan that let the owner choose any of the eggs from the first five versions of the toy and then some new unlocked ones through various different methods.
5948600	5955720	And that came out worldwide in 2019, which was the anniversary outside of Japan.
5956720	5960800	So we're going to go ahead and start with just the basics with this.
5960800	5985800	I mean, you can see in the video for those who are watching, you know, feed them a little squishy, whatever, Mon, but you can check the pet status, age, weight, strength, hunger, energy, or feed the Digimon to make him full, increase its strength, increase its energy, you know, train the Digimon so that it loses weight and increases strength.
5985800	5996800	You have your battle mode where you link the two together through these little readers on the top, and then they can have a battle.
5997800	6008800	You can also clean up their poo. If you don't clean up their poo, the Digimon becomes sick. You can toggle the light, like, okay, it's that right here in the video is what the little connectors look like.
6008800	6028800	But you can turn the light on and off in this little virtual house so that the Digimon can sleep. If you leave the light on while they're sleeping, then their condition decreases and you would not have a chance of a high powered evolution.
6028800	6039800	And then there's healing your Digimon. If your Digimon gets sick or injured in battle, you would have to heal them before they can battle again.
6040800	6047800	So the original Digimon device had three buttons and a reset button all on the right hand side of the screen.
6048800	6055800	There's A to go through your icons and options. The middle B would activate the function and C cancels whatever is on the screen.
6056800	6071800	And pressing A and C simultaneously toggles the sound, which, you know, mutes or unmutes in the reset button, is that little tiny hole that was between the B and C button and you would have to use like a pen or a pen to do the reset.
6071800	6083800	The metal contacts is where they would touch to be able to communicate. Well, that wasn't all for Digimon.
6084800	6095800	So we got, in 1998, the Pendulum series came out that introduced the Jogress function. So you could combine your Digimon.
6095800	6115800	The Pendulum would count the number of times the device has been shaken. And then there was the Pendulum Progress series. After that, the Pendulum X series that was accompanied by Digimon Chronicle for the, it was a story that came out.
6116800	6134800	There was Digimon Mini. There was a Wonderswan that had the original Digimon as a game. There's the 20th Anniversary one, Digimon Pendulum 20th Anniversary, Digimon X, which was the original one that had the 20th Anniversary features, and the Pendulum X series.
6134800	6147800	There's Digimon Pendulum Z. All kinds of stuff. I mean, well, and then let's not forget what spawned from this little, you know, brick looking thing.
6148800	6167800	We had the Digimon, there were Digimon anime that, and you know how I feel about the Digimon anime. I think that the first two series are super superior to basically any other thing.
6167800	6179800	And then Digimon Tribe makes my heart happy and a little bit sad in some ways. There's also a manga called Come On Digimon. There were just all kinds of stuff in it.
6179800	6199800	And then I also had like the, the D3, which were the, actually I had a Digivice and Dan gave it to Julie. And I kept saying, don't give it to her. It's mine. You cannot give something that is mine to somebody else.
6199800	6212800	And I still want it back to this day, but no one knows where anything is at Julie's house. And then I had the, the D3 and I had the black D3 with the little laptop thingy that they had.
6212800	6222800	Cause I, like I said, I was super into Digimon 02 and I actually ended up giving them to a friend who was a really big fan only to realize that the D3, the black D3 was the short pack.
6223800	6239800	So, oh well. So yeah, I mean, there has been like nine Digimon series and a bunch of films and a bunch of games and a bunch of manga.
6239800	6254800	And there was a Ma Hua in China. There was a Dark Horse comics. There's a Italian one or called, done by a group called Panini.
6254800	6271800	It was, it's just, there's the card game. There's a card game too. So, I mean, there's just all kinds of merchandising and it all came from this little brick, this little brick wall looking thing.
6271800	6289800	And I had the blue one. My, I would always somehow or another evolve a Devimon without fail. I don't know how, but I always had a Devimon. So, and there we go. It is, it's the digital monster.
6290800	6299800	A quick comment from our chat where as Joe and Hunter Matt says, oh God, I remember confiscating these from kids when I was summer camp counselor, and of course returning them at the end of the day.
6299800	6306800	We did this because they would always lose it and then we'd have to hear about it or run around hunting them down. Those kids were five at the time.
6306800	6312800	Now those kids are going to be 28 to 29 now. BRB going to find a corner to rock and cry in the fetal position for a bit.
6313800	6325800	Glad you could feel the same thing. We feel a lot here on this program. But yeah, these things, these things are also very well known for getting taken away from kids at school quite often.
6327800	6337800	We were all like in our early twenties and we all had our Digimon and our pocket Pikachu. And I had my Puyo Lin because I was cooler than everybody.
6338800	6341800	What's a Puyo Lin? Puyo Puyo is the best. Shut up.
6342800	6345800	I was gonna say, I'm pretty sure I had it like a Tamagotchi in like college.
6346800	6362800	Yeah. Well, I mean, I remember it was just like, we would always bust a mountain, see who would win. And we were like different like, and everyone like else, like had their Tamagotchi and we had our Digimon and we're like, we're edgier. We're cooler.
6362800	6364800	So we're so fucking edgy.
6365800	6372800	All right. Let's travel around and check out some edgy headlines. No, literally, they're on the edge of tonight's show. Roll just a few quick headlines.
6372800	6375800	You'll pay for the whole seat, but you'll only need the edge.
6378800	6381800	Some rapid fire news. Loki, why don't you start us off?
6381800	6393800	I'll leave it up to modders to put in characters in the games that they wanted, but never got. So we have Chrono from Chrono Trigger being added to Smash Brothers Ultimate.
6395800	6403800	I'm not sure who this character actually replaces, but it even gives Kirby a custom outfit as well, which is kind of funny.
6403800	6409800	It's an, I'm sorry, Chrono is an alternative costume for Hero from Dragon Quest.
6409800	6410800	That makes sense.
6410800	6411800	Neat.
6411800	6413800	Character model looks really good.
6413800	6415800	Yeah, it does. It looks pretty cool.
6415800	6421800	And I'm really impressed with modding communities. This is amazing.
6421800	6432800	And then we have the Nintendo 64 version of Pokemon Snap coming to the Nintendo Switch online on June 24th as part of the online expansion pack.
6435800	6436800	I'm paying for it still.
6436800	6442800	I know. I was like, honestly, this is the most compelling case yet for me to maybe sign up for that pack.
6442800	6445800	You know, I still don't have it after all this time. Never got the expansion.
6445800	6449800	Maybe, maybe I'll break one of these days. We'll see. But not yet.
6449800	6453800	All right. Let's go to Dark Soccer.
6453800	6455800	I think you have one quick story.
6455800	6458800	Treasure. Treasure is one of my favorite companies.
6458800	6468800	They have given me so many wonderful games, including one of my husband's favorite games, Gunstar Heroes and Silhouette Mirage.
6468800	6474800	And Doki Doki Mischief Makers, Wario World, Sin and Punishment.
6474800	6487800	But there was a tweet put out by by Treasure's Twitter that said that they are working on a highly requested title in a tweet that was celebrating their 30th anniversary.
6487800	6494800	It roughly translates to on June 19th, 2022, Treasure Inc celebrates its 30th anniversary.
6494800	6501800	In this 30th anniversary year, we are working hard to release quote that unquote title that has been requested by many of you.
6501800	6506800	We look forward to your continued support of Treasure.
6506800	6507800	We don't know what it'll be.
6507800	6512800	I think that the the byline on this one is please be Sin and Punishment three.
6512800	6515800	It'll be that game.
6515800	6517800	They just it's that it's a game called that.
6517800	6521800	I would like another Silhouette Mirage.
6521800	6522800	We'll see. We'll see.
6522800	6525800	They did it. They did a Gunstar Heroes follow up.
6525800	6526800	Yeah.
6527800	6530800	So I wonder if it'll be a Sin and Punishment three.
6530800	6532800	I bet a lot of people would be very happy to see that.
6532800	6533800	So, yeah.
6533800	6534800	All right.
6534800	6544800	Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games you'll be playing a lot sooner than you will Sin and Punishment three.
6544800	6546800	I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games.
6546800	6547800	I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games.
6547800	6550800	I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games.
6550800	6565800	I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games this week, but we've got looks like Fall Guys getting a release on PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series and Nintendo Switch.
6565800	6572800	Shadowrun trilogy is going to be out on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
6572800	6576800	We've got Wreckfest coming to Nintendo Switch.
6576800	6585800	And then, let's see, Sonic Origins on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.
6585800	6593800	AI, the Sonium Files, Nirvana Initiative on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6593800	6600800	Capcom Fighting Collection on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
6600800	6606800	And last but not least, Fire Emblem Three Hopes on Nintendo Switch.
6606800	6614800	Going over to Japan. Yeah, it's a it's a fairly busy week there and some of the same tentpole games that Loki said for the US are also hitting Japan the same week.
6614800	6618800	That includes Fire Emblem Warriors Three Hopes on the Switch.
6618800	6623800	Also on the Switch, we have the Capcom Fighting Collection making its way there as well.
6623800	6628800	We also have that AI Somnium Files Nirvana Initiative that Loki referenced.
6628800	6630800	We also have a game called Nine Nine.
6630800	6633800	So it's the number nine and then it's the word nine spelled out.
6633800	6635800	That is also coming out in Japan.
6635800	6639800	And it looks like it looks like another like dating sim type of thing.
6639800	6641800	So we'll leave it at that.
6641800	6642800	I think a visual novel though.
6642800	6644800	Yeah, visual novel type of thing.
6644800	6648800	Ayoku no Istuya, Angel's Blessing in a regular limited edition.
6648800	6651800	Miike no Looper Celia in a regular limited edition.
6651800	6655800	Also hitting the Switch this week and Code Realize future blessings.
6655800	6657800	Also making its way out to Japan this week.
6657800	6661800	All of that on the Switch on the PlayStation five this week.
6661800	6663800	Nothing.
6663800	6668800	But the PlayStation four sees many of those same releases we already outlined on the Switch.
6668800	6672800	I don't really see a whole lot of differences or anything unique.
6672800	6674800	It's pretty much a lot of the same games I've seen.
6674800	6677800	So we'll go over to Japan, Dark Sakura.
6677800	6678800	We're going to Europe.
6678800	6679800	I'm sorry.
6679800	6682800	We're going to leave Japan and go to Europe.
6682800	6687800	On the 21st for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch, we have Zorro the Chronicles.
6687800	6690800	Also on the 21st for Switch, we have Wreckfest.
6690800	6694800	On the 23rd for PlayStation, we have Audubon Police Simulator 3.
6694800	6698800	And on the 24th for Switch, we have Fire Emblem Warriors 3.
6698800	6699800	And that's it.
6699800	6700800	All right.
6700800	6703800	Got a few titles there that are coming out worldwide.
6703800	6704800	All right.
6704800	6707800	Well, that was all we had for headlines tonight.
6707800	6710800	So we get to go to have an empty mailbox.
6710800	6711800	We have an empty mailbox.
6711800	6712800	That's a shame.
6712800	6713800	I just want to point.
6713800	6717800	I don't want to guilt you all or anything, but I do want to point out next week is our
6717800	6720800	20th anniversary.
6720800	6722800	And Rob, what do you want to say?
6722800	6725800	I want to point out that next week is our 20th anniversary.
6726800	6727800	And Rob wants to make me work.
6727800	6728800	I'd love to hear you.
6728800	6732800	I'm willing to share the responsibilities if we were to actually get flooded with emails,
6732800	6737800	especially some of you we haven't heard from in a very long time or ever.
6737800	6741800	Consider this your cordial invitation to email us.
6741800	6743800	Participate at orangelaundry.com.
6743800	6744800	Are you lazy?
6744800	6745800	Fine.
6745800	6746800	Write a tweet at OLR.
6746800	6748800	I don't always read the tweets, but I'll read them next week.
6748800	6749800	Do?
6749800	6750800	What's that?
6750800	6751800	Voice to text.
6751800	6752800	Yeah.
6752800	6753800	Dictation.
6753800	6754800	Yeah.
6754800	6755800	Yeah.
6755800	6756800	Just any of that.
6756800	6761800	Uh, I would just love to hear since it is the 20 year anniversary, just tell us like,
6761800	6764800	what, why do you listen?
6764800	6766800	Like, what, what can we do more of?
6766800	6767800	What do you like?
6767800	6768800	What do you not like?
6768800	6769800	You know what?
6769800	6770800	It's a birthday show.
6770800	6771800	Don't tell us what you don't like.
6771800	6772800	Tell us what you like.
6772800	6775800	Then the next week, tell us what you don't like.
6775800	6778800	Um, tell us how you started listening to us and what's kept you here.
6778800	6780800	I just, I would love to hear from you.
6780800	6782800	So, uh, yeah.
6782800	6784800	Send us those emails, tweets, whatever.
6784800	6785800	Sure.
6785800	6786800	TikTok says Bobby Black Wolf.
6786800	6787800	Why not?
6787800	6788800	Why not?
6788800	6790960	But in the meantime, we do have our green room.
6790960	6796640	We have live phone calls, uh, available and we do have somebody who wants to call in tonight.
6796640	6798560	So I think we should get to that person.
6798560	6799560	Hello.
6799560	6800560	You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
6800560	6801560	Who's this?
6801560	6803260	Hey, it's the one and only Rama.
6803260	6804320	How is everybody doing tonight?
6804320	6805680	I am doing great.
6805680	6806800	And it's great to hear from you.
6806800	6807800	Rama.
6807800	6808800	How are you?
6808800	6809800	Good.
6809800	6810800	Good.
6810800	6811800	There we go.
6811800	6814080	I love having an extended vacation, extended weekend.
6814080	6815080	You know.
6815080	6816080	How did we lose Loki?
6816080	6817640	Well, Happy Juneteenth.
6817640	6818640	Now on this.
6818640	6819640	Thank you.
6819640	6820640	Thank you.
6820640	6821640	All right.
6821640	6827240	Now, so while I fix the camera, to what do we owe this lovely phone call tonight?
6827240	6828280	A couple of things.
6828280	6839040	Number one, Final Fantasy 7, I just want to say, as I played through the game, I noticed
6839040	6840040	some differences.
6840040	6843720	I'm just like, okay, let's see where this goes.
6843720	6848880	When I finished the first game, I was talking to one of my besties, Chibi Tifa.
6848880	6854760	We basically said, by the time you finish the first game, if you don't realize this
6854760	6860600	is not the original FF7 you're playing, you need to go back to the drawing board.
6860600	6865440	We were watching people on Twitter lose their proverbial shit over this because they're
6865440	6871560	getting angry and upset at how much this deviates from the original.
6871560	6875480	As somebody who has played through the original game, I'm all for it.
6875480	6879640	I don't know how you could miss that it deviates from the original.
6879640	6882600	Again, I'm not trying to spoil every detail.
6882600	6888280	They kill someone who wasn't killed in the original as a way to explain that this is
6888280	6889280	different.
6889280	6891320	Rob, it's been 25 years.
6891320	6892320	Spoil away.
6892320	6893320	I'm sorry.
6893320	6894320	Like y'all said earlier.
6894320	6895320	In the remakes.
6895320	6897320	The remake's two years old, so yeah.
6897320	6898320	Okay.
6898320	6900080	The remake's been two years.
6900080	6901600	It's dirt cheap now.
6901600	6903960	It's been on PlayStation Plus.
6903960	6904960	I'm sorry.
6904960	6907040	There's no NDA on spoiling it at this point.
6907040	6908040	Yes, I know.
6908040	6909040	I know.
6909040	6911760	But I'm going to leave it at that.
6911760	6912920	I made my point.
6912920	6915840	I'll leave it at that.
6915840	6918360	People are quite upset about this.
6918360	6920840	I get it and I understand it.
6920840	6927280	I'm like this, here's a chance to retell the entire series.
6927280	6932880	I mean, hell, if you have the official strategy guide, it has everything listed out for eras,
6932880	6937280	weapons, all of that, and you mean to tell me in the original game, the only way I could
6937280	6940080	play her after she dies is to use a GameShark?
6940080	6941080	Come on.
6941080	6942080	Come on.
6942080	6946200	Well, you know, it's for plot purposes.
6946200	6949680	What do you think about the whole renaming of the game too?
6949680	6952900	Because a lot of people were expecting it would be called Remake Part 2, but now we
6952900	6955240	know that the game is called Rebirth.
6955240	6957540	What did you think when you heard the title?
6957540	6964000	I was legitimately curious because I could not put my finger on it as to why it's Rebirth,
6964000	6966160	but you nailed it.
6966160	6967160	You nailed it.
6967160	6972400	That makes the most amount of sense because part one, yes, it's a remake.
6972400	6977800	Going back to the board, they're remaking certain things, they're fleshing certain stories
6977800	6980620	about certain tropes, characters.
6980620	6985840	By the time you finish the first game, you automatically know it's going somewhere else.
6985840	6991920	So that Rebirth, all right, it's like, we're going to go back to the drawing board one
6991920	6993000	more time.
6993000	6997360	We're going to do things way different and we're going to go in a different direction.
6997360	7002160	I'm going to place money on the third part being called Resurrected or Resurrection,
7002160	7003260	some form of that.
7003260	7005040	I'm going to say this.
7005040	7007620	There is the particular character that dies.
7007620	7011880	Now we all know originally she was killed.
7011880	7019040	I believe in the new trilogy, if she does die, it's her choice.
7019040	7025060	She understands everything that's going on and it's her choice to do it.
7025060	7026060	Yes.
7026060	7027060	Yes.
7027060	7031500	I think that will be a very big element that couldn't be explored in the original.
7031500	7035380	I think you're spot on with that and you can say it's Eryth because again, for the 25 year
7035380	7039500	old game, I don't care about the spoiler, for the two year old game, I'll try to watch
7039500	7042980	my mouth and that's all you get.
7042980	7047680	But I'm not going to, if it falls out, if I say, oops.
7047680	7051740	But as far as that goes, I think you're absolutely right.
7051740	7059020	I think if she does die, she wanted to, or she felt a need that she had to, which was
7059020	7060800	kind of that way in the original.
7060800	7062820	She felt she had to.
7062820	7068180	But yeah, I think it's going to be a lot more explicit in a way that it wasn't before.
7068180	7073140	Ooh, Bobby Black Wolf suggests Resolution as the third game title.
7073140	7074140	Oh, I like that.
7074140	7075140	I like that.
7075140	7076140	That could work, yeah.
7076140	7079140	Re-vengeance says Mike Deft.
7079140	7080140	No.
7080140	7081140	Re-vengeance.
7081140	7087580	Revolution, like Dance Dance Revolution, but people will get the wrong, people wouldn't
7087580	7088860	get that reference, so nevermind.
7088860	7090340	I'm trying to think what other RE.
7090340	7096340	Questmaster says Restoration, ah, OK, OK, Restoration.
7096340	7097940	Like restoring the original timeline.
7097940	7098940	We'll see.
7098940	7099940	I don't know.
7099940	7100940	I don't know.
7100940	7101940	I'll say this much.
7101940	7105300	At least I have time to get a PlayStation 5, you know?
7105300	7106300	Yeah, right.
7106300	7107300	That's where I'm at.
7107300	7114460	Final Fantasy XVI and VII Rebirth are in 2023, then I have until 2023.
7114460	7119640	And it seems very obvious, XVI is loading up the first half of the year, Rebirth is
7119640	7122480	bringing up the rear, so if they even make it.
7122480	7124240	I don't think it'll make it.
7124240	7129080	I'm still a little salty that, you know, they didn't announce it for Xbox Series X, even
7129080	7135680	though both consoles are basically the same, I would assume as exclusivity, I'm not really
7135680	7140400	upset by it, because I said from jump, I'm going to get both consoles.
7140400	7147040	And right now, there's only two games on PS5 that I want, and one of them is on PS4 now.
7147040	7148240	I'm not even too worried about it.
7148240	7152400	I'll get both consoles as well, love my Series X, but yeah, there's just going to be stuff
7152400	7153920	I need to get a PS5 for.
7153920	7157360	The only reason I'm holding out now is I'm just holding out to see if they do a hardware
7157360	7158360	refresh.
7158360	7159360	That's it.
7159360	7163080	Because I know otherwise the minute I buy one, oh, the PS5 Mini or the PS5 Pro or the
7163080	7167360	PS5B, whatever is going to come out.
7167360	7172280	I'm seeing now at the point where when they announce PlayStation 5s are available, you
7172280	7175240	can actually, you don't have to rush the websites to get it.
7175240	7179680	I've seen them sitting online for up to a day before they're sold out.
7179680	7184800	So I'm like, at least I have a fighting chance, at least now I can be like, do I really want
7184800	7185800	one?
7185800	7189360	Yeah, it's started a website, sold out, I'll wait for the next one.
7189360	7194040	You know what else is partially to thank?
7194040	7204160	Bitcoin eating shit, because now Bitcoin and let's be clear, Ramen, before we toast, let's
7204160	7210000	be clear, all cryptocurrency eating massive shit.
7210000	7211000	Okay.
7211000	7212000	Okay.
7212000	7213000	All right.
7213000	7214000	Okay.
7214000	7215000	Okay.
7215000	7219840	I wanted to talk about Shredder's Revenge, but back away, I've only told two people this.
7219840	7224080	I'm going to tell you all this because y'all are awesome and y'all not going to judge me
7224080	7225600	and I still don't care.
7225600	7235160	I just want you to know from September of last year to I would say January of this year,
7235160	7243360	I have lost about $7,500 in crypto, but here's the thing, I'm not upset by it.
7243360	7245240	I'm not really worried by it.
7245240	7250680	I've been investing in crypto for like three, four years, total of like three grand.
7250680	7252960	It was a long-term investment.
7252960	7258880	It was just something where after everything is said and done, I'm retiring, cash it out.
7258880	7259880	That's all that was.
7259880	7264440	And I'm looking at my account, I'm just like, I got my 401k, I got this, I ain't worried
7264440	7265440	about it.
7265440	7269880	It's just a long-term thing for me.
7269880	7271240	If you want to judge me, go right ahead.
7271240	7272240	I'm not going to judge you.
7272240	7274080	Some people foolishly dumped everything in it.
7274080	7275080	Yeah.
7275080	7279100	I'm not going to judge you because I got on the hype wagon for like maybe for my Reno
7279100	7281840	budget in 2021, $150.
7281840	7285240	That's it.
7285240	7290200	I put in like $5 and cashed it out at $10.
7290200	7291200	Good job.
7291200	7293040	You're the only one that made money.
7293040	7294040	I did Ethereum.
7294040	7296280	That's why I did too.
7296280	7299880	So at least you have a good attitude about it, Rama.
7299880	7303240	So here's to fucking up.
7303240	7305080	And I started noticing going down, like, you know what?
7305080	7306080	I'm going to stop investing.
7306080	7307680	I'm going to leave it right here.
7307680	7311880	I'm just going to let whatever's in there roll over and it's slowly making its way back
7311880	7312880	up.
7312880	7315760	If it hits the original amount by end of the year, good.
7315760	7318160	If it does not, is what it is.
7318160	7319720	I can still pay my bills.
7319720	7321360	I can still live my life.
7321360	7325880	I'm not knocking on relatives door begging for money because I dropped my entire paycheck
7325880	7327920	into crypto.
7327920	7329480	You know, it's kind of funny.
7329480	7335180	It's like, I'm anti NFT, but I'm okay with crypto because I kind of know you're going
7335180	7337000	to get something out of crypto.
7337000	7340480	NFT is like a photocopy receipt.
7340480	7346820	And Matt in chat has this and says, main thing is you're not a crypto bro that is calling
7346820	7348440	a sheep and that we're wrong.
7348440	7349440	Yes.
7349440	7350440	That's the clear difference.
7350440	7351640	You're a big boy.
7351640	7353480	You made a big boy decision.
7353480	7355940	A big boy consequence happened.
7355940	7361120	And you're just going to have a big boy attitude and say, well, I knew the risk, oops.
7361120	7362200	I'm like, I lost.
7362200	7363200	It is what it is.
7363200	7364480	I'm not crying.
7364480	7369280	You know, it's like, it's just like playing the stock market half the time.
7369280	7370280	Yeah, exactly.
7370280	7371280	Exactly.
7371280	7372280	Always remember.
7372280	7374620	And Questmaster says, always remember, it could have been much, much worse.
7374620	7377820	Never invest or bet more than you can stomach to lose.
7377820	7385120	Very good advice, especially true with Diablo Immortal and other gotcha games out there.
7385120	7389720	I also don't understand why Metacritic shreds the shit out of Diablo Immortal.
7389720	7392160	Well, I do, but listen to my full statement here.
7392160	7397120	I don't understand why Metacritic shreds the shit out of that game and not plenty of
7397120	7400720	other games out there that are just as guilty.
7400720	7403840	I think because of the name that's attached to it.
7403840	7404840	Of course it is.
7404840	7405840	Of course it is.
7405840	7406840	Do you think-
7406840	7407840	High expectations.
7407840	7412760	Do you, do you know what a fuck fest that Nino, I don't know how else to describe it.
7412760	7417640	Do you know what a fuck fest that Nino Cooney game is that just came out?
7417640	7419640	Like that game is a mess.
7419640	7420640	Don't get me started.
7420640	7421640	Do not get me started.
7422120	7423440	That game is a mess.
7423440	7425240	She's messy, your honor.
7425240	7428760	You have been found guilty of public mess.
7428760	7430640	You have been a mess.
7430640	7433720	Rob, the last mobile game-
7433720	7437120	Mario Kondo can't even fix you, Nino Cooney.
7437120	7444600	Look, the last game I actually devoted my time away into playing with Sailor Moon Drops
7444600	7446760	until they shut the servers down.
7446760	7448360	I wouldn't have to play little other-
7448360	7451600	You got my fucking husband into that game too, damn you.
7452560	7454480	Hey, you know, you know it's a damn good game.
7454480	7455480	Come on now.
7455480	7458360	Someone's trying to bring it back, but good luck to them.
7458360	7461000	But when I heard about Nino Cooney, I was like, yo, I am all up in this.
7461000	7462280	I'm going to jump into this.
7462280	7463760	I heard something about NFT.
7463760	7464760	Nope.
7464760	7465760	Nope.
7465760	7466760	I'm out.
7466760	7467760	Yeah.
7467760	7468760	That's right.
7468760	7469760	You know what?
7469760	7470760	If you are one of those people that has spent thousands of dollars on Diablo Immortal and
7470760	7473640	you're really mad at us for the earlier conversation, let me give you this.
7473640	7477760	At least you haven't spent any time playing Nino Cooney.
7477760	7480480	Well, I won't say it was me.
7480480	7482480	So you can sleep okay tonight.
7482480	7485680	I could definitely sleep okay, but I will say this.
7485680	7492160	There are people who will just blindly spend that type of money on gotchas left and right.
7492160	7497680	I have seen the worst end of that and it ain't pretty.
7497680	7502960	Questbuster in chat says Nino Cooney mobile is so bad that players are complaining of
7502960	7508320	half an hour queue times because bots are hogging up all the spots to farm crypto in
7508320	7509500	the game.
7509500	7514180	There's even an in-game event slated in the future that requires you to link a crypto
7514180	7517660	wallet and people aren't happy.
7517660	7521940	See that kind of reminds me of when people start playing WoW years ago and the whole
7521940	7523460	gold farming and all of that.
7523460	7526580	I'm just like, well, you know, hey.
7526580	7527580	Anyway.
7527580	7530660	Oh, you want to talk about Shredder's Revenge?
7530660	7533180	Can we can we have a nice palate cleanser, please?
7533180	7534180	Absolutely.
7534180	7538500	So what are we having VOD game night to play some play some Shredder's Revenge, man?
7538500	7540980	I am absolutely loving this game.
7540980	7545900	You can't see it, but I actually took out my fighting game joystick just to play this
7545900	7546900	game.
7546900	7553180	I felt like twelve fucking years old in the laundromat playing as Donatello going through
7553180	7554180	this game.
7554180	7560120	I I don't know about you, but I won't say the main thing.
7560120	7562340	I won't play that game with you, Rama.
7562340	7563340	Why?
7563340	7564580	Because I also played Donatello.
7564580	7565580	So fuck you.
7565580	7569420	Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.
7569420	7570420	You my boy.
7570420	7572780	I will gladly switch Leonardo for you.
7572780	7573780	That was so good.
7573780	7574780	I'm sorry.
7574780	7575780	That was so good.
7575780	7576780	Wasn't it?
7576780	7581060	So I fucking love you.
7581060	7583460	Love all of y'all.
7583460	7585340	I also am happy to play Leonardo.
7585340	7588980	I actually had to step away for a second because there's a spider.
7588980	7590980	I'll be right back.
7590980	7592140	This you'd be nice to it.
7592140	7593540	Is the house going to burn down?
7593540	7594540	Are you going to be OK?
7594700	7595700	Good.
7595700	7599860	Just escorted out of the house and thank you for its work and eating other bugs in your
7599860	7600860	house.
7600860	7601860	I don't know.
7601860	7602860	But.
7602860	7603860	But.
7603860	7604860	If Loki's connection goes down.
7604860	7608660	While Raphael is my favorite turtle, my favorite to play is Donatello.
7608660	7609660	Yeah.
7609660	7613980	It was because the staff had the range and like I didn't like playing Raphael because
7613980	7616180	the side didn't have the range at all.
7616180	7619300	But I imagine some people that would play him were really good as him.
7619300	7622420	So it's just, you know, you you sacrifice distance for speed.
7622420	7623420	Yeah.
7623420	7624420	Speed, too.
7624420	7625420	So.
7625420	7628340	But there's always the badass one.
7628340	7635540	There is one thing about the game and I that they did and I absolutely lost my shit over.
7635540	7636780	It's the font.
7636780	7643100	The main font in the game is the original font from the first from both arcade games.
7643100	7649020	For me, that's like an ultimate Easter egg, because that's like to me personally, you
7649020	7654740	know, it's a turtles game when it's that particular font for like where you're putting
7654740	7658940	in your name and the rankings and the credits and stuff like that.
7658940	7660140	That had me.
7660140	7664860	I'm sure if she wanted to, Dark Soccer could give us a whole seminar on how typography
7664860	7666300	invokes emotion.
7666300	7667620	And that's kind of the point.
7667620	7669620	I see her smiling over there.
7669620	7675660	That's why I didn't say anything, because I've said it enough that you know that I'm
7675660	7678680	thinking the typography thoughts in my head.
7678680	7679680	Exactly.
7679680	7689000	So yes, even art invokes emotion and even something as silly as a font will probably
7689000	7690560	make you think of certain things.
7690560	7696560	Like I don't want to I don't want to like talk us up too much, but you will notice the
7696560	7700000	font that we use here at VOG Network on the site.
7700000	7704160	It's a font you see a lot of places and sometimes you might see it and go, oh, that's like the
7704160	7705160	VOG writing.
7705160	7706560	But it's a font.
7706560	7707560	It's a font.
7707560	7708560	You can see it around.
7708560	7710520	I can tell everyone what it is, if you want to know.
7710520	7713080	Yeah, it's well, it's your your style.
7713080	7714080	Yeah.
7714080	7719560	So I thought that it looked very futuristic and honestly, it was easy to modify it into
7719560	7721200	a power button and it looked really good.
7721200	7722200	Yeah.
7722200	7726720	Your modified version that's like the VOG logo is great, is totally what a logo should
7726720	7727720	be.
7727720	7728720	So, yeah.
7728720	7729720	Yeah.
7729720	7730720	Anyway.
7730720	7735040	However, I will go on record and say that I like writing letters in Futura and leave
7735040	7736600	it at that.
7736640	7739680	Articius says, surprised y'all aren't using serpentine bold.
7739680	7746440	I get that reference and I almost wanted to use it for the top font here, but it's just
7746440	7747440	a little too.
7747440	7753240	I didn't love the way it looked, which I actually since I did move everything over from the
7753240	7754240	old computer.
7754240	7756840	OK, so I'm on Futura bold.
7756840	7760500	So since you brought it up.
7760500	7761500	That's what it looks like.
7761500	7766940	I don't love it because it's a little too thick for me.
7766940	7770540	You're not going to hear me say that very often.
7770540	7774420	He's got honestly enough, but it actually is.
7774420	7777460	It actually is pretty balanced, interesting.
7777460	7781780	It's a little like for but for for the top part, I think so.
7781780	7785880	But for the bottom half, like I feel like it kind of takes away from where the eyes
7785880	7787460	ought to be here.
7787460	7788460	Yeah.
7788460	7789460	Yeah.
7789460	7791340	So that's that's my only issue with it.
7791340	7796540	So anyway, it kind of reminds me of the font that we use for anime jam session, because
7796540	7801240	let's be real, everybody hates Comic Sans.
7801240	7803300	So I stumbled across the comic new way.
7803300	7805620	I'm like, oh, this is nice.
7805620	7809880	I will tell you one thing about Comic Sans, though, that I learned is that it's easier
7809880	7813060	for dyslexic people to read it.
7813060	7819900	Interesting, but there's also much better dyslexic centered fonts now.
7820460	7825340	Rama, I will take you up on that Turtles game night very soon.
7825340	7826340	Stay tuned for details.
7826340	7831660	As soon as they get everything settled here, which should be soon, we'll have a go at it.
7831660	7834260	Anything else on your mind tonight you want to talk to us about?
7834260	7838860	They are brand new digivices out there that look like smartwatches called the Digivices.
7838860	7839860	Yeah, I know.
7839860	7840860	Yeah.
7840860	7842860	There's a couple of people on my Facebook that are kind of wanting them.
7842860	7843860	So.
7843860	7844860	Awesome.
7844860	7845860	All right, my friend.
7845860	7847440	Well, I will let you go.
7847480	7850320	Take care, anime jam session.
7850320	7851480	Listen to it.
7851480	7852900	Love it.
7852900	7854600	I wish I would touch it.
7854600	7859360	We had a big it wasn't anime, but we had a big convention here in SAC this weekend called
7859360	7863480	Sinister Creature Con, which is like horror movies and FX.
7863480	7866960	I would love to call into your show to talk about it because it's close enough that they
7866960	7867960	got cosplay.
7867960	7869760	They got all that same stuff, right?
7869760	7874640	Actually, you know, that would be in our wheelbarrow because we did cover a couple of steampunk
7874640	7878480	conventions years ago when it was popular.
7878480	7882320	And one of my friends, she does a lot of those types of conventions anyway.
7882320	7883840	One small problem.
7883840	7884840	I didn't go.
7884840	7889720	And the reason why is that I just had conflicts with timing this weekend.
7889720	7893400	I hosted the after party that they did.
7893400	7897200	We actually had Voltaire, big nerd musician that's done music.
7897200	7902040	He's like a DragonCon staple and it's so because I'm like, I even said to him, I said, it's
7902040	7907320	so nice to see you like outside DragonCon.
7907320	7912280	I totally get that because in September I'm going to a convention called retro cons.
7912280	7917240	It's all like 80s and 90s cartoons and toys and stuff.
7917240	7922480	And the main reason why I'm going is Venus Terzo is going to be a guest there.
7922480	7926560	So you know, I have to get my Ron will have art book autographed by her.
7926560	7928160	Oh, I love that.
7928160	7929160	Excuse me.
7929160	7930160	I love that.
7930160	7931160	I love that.
7931280	7936160	Right now, me and my friend, we're going to do Velma and Shaggy for the con or Luigi and
7936160	7937160	Daisy.
7937160	7938160	We just haven't figured it out yet.
7938160	7939960	I will say really quick on the Voltaire thing.
7939960	7943040	I wanted to take a quick step back because it actually wasn't DragonCon that introduced
7943040	7944040	me to him.
7944040	7947000	It was Deft that introduced me to him.
7947000	7951380	And because he originally covered that when he was writing, like, I love the song articles
7951380	7953920	for the early stages of VOG network site.
7953920	7958720	And I remember because I actually really dug the song that he had picked and I did not
7958720	7959720	realize.
7959720	7962480	Apparently Voltaire is actually just generally pretty popular in Mexico because he told this
7962480	7969280	whole story on stage about how his girlfriend heard the song of his at the Mexican DMV and
7969280	7971840	like called him to say like your songs on.
7971840	7973740	So he had this whole little monologue about it.
7973740	7978000	He's a very good performer in the fact that he tells stories with his music.
7978000	7979000	So it's good.
7979000	7981680	And then he played the song in English and Spanish, which I thought was really cute.
7981680	7983800	So yeah, that is really cool.
7983800	7984800	Yeah.
7984800	7992040	Let's do a cosplay crossover with Luigi, you know, from Luigi's Mansion and Shaggy.
7992040	7993040	Okay.
7993040	7998640	Before we get into that, Matt, I don't think you've seen it, but I have done Ghostbusters
7998640	7999640	Luigi.
7999640	8004320	It is called Boo Busters Luigi, proton pack jumpsuit.
8004320	8009160	The pack here is a ghost from Super Mario Brothers and it glows in the dark.
8009160	8013120	I will post photos on the OLR page for y'all to see it.
8013120	8014120	I've seen it.
8014120	8015120	I love them.
8015120	8016120	All right.
8016120	8017400	All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go.
8017400	8018400	Take care.
8018400	8019400	And thanks for the call tonight.
8019400	8020400	No problem.
8020400	8021400	Love you guys.
8021400	8022400	Appreciate you all.
8022400	8023400	See you on the flip side.
8023400	8024400	Hugs and kisses.
8024400	8025400	Bye.
8025400	8026400	Cheesecake.
8026400	8027400	Right.
8027400	8032000	Good to hear from folks.
8032000	8035120	Participate at orangesontraded.com to send us emails.
8035120	8042680	Also in chat, this was posted like 30 minutes ago in chat, but I want to make sure I answer
8042680	8046640	it because from our very own Bobby Black Wolf who said, so what are you looking forward
8046640	8051600	to at SGDQ, which is coming up next week?
8051600	8053240	I don't even know now.
8053240	8054240	Next week.
8054240	8055240	Next week.
8055240	8058800	He's, I don't think it actually starts, starts until the same night as OLR.
8058800	8062840	I don't remember if it starts that Sunday or if it actually doesn't start till Monday,
8062840	8067420	but I'm looking forward to our very own Bobby Black Wolf doing more announcing, but this
8067420	8069720	time live and in person.
8069720	8072560	So that will be, he, I know he's doing.
8072560	8077960	Yakuza like a dragon is the big one and I don't mean to say any speed run is bigger
8077960	8078960	than others.
8078960	8083620	However, Bobby is kind of an honorary part of the Yakuza speed run community at this
8083620	8086040	point, I think, cause he's hosted a lot of them.
8086040	8087800	So that'll be a fun one to see.
8087800	8091360	Although I guess I can only really watch the beginning because I still haven't beat the
8091360	8092360	game.
8092360	8096240	And we know it will spoil the end, but I know he's hosting some other games as well.
8096240	8098040	And so that'll be, that'll be fun.
8098040	8099920	I don't know what, oh, go ahead.
8099920	8100920	All right.
8100920	8104960	Bobby says it starts Sunday at noon Eastern, um, respectfully, I have a lot of, of other
8104960	8106560	things on my mind on Sunday.
8106560	8109440	So if there's a run, I really have to see, at least they put everything on YouTube, but
8109440	8112320	I'll watch later in the week for sure.
8112320	8114920	I was going to say, I don't know what this is, but it sounds awesome.
8114920	8119800	Mega Man extreme versus Mega Man extreme two, a hundred percent extreme mode.
8119800	8121520	Oh, that's Game Boy color.
8121520	8122520	Okay.
8122520	8126880	Oh, looking forward to all the money that will be raised for a worthy cause.
8126880	8127880	Yes.
8127960	8131440	Is this the prevent cancer one or is this Doctors Without Borders?
8131440	8136440	One of them is either one, you know, no, no, they're both worthy causes, but the winner
8136440	8138720	one is always one charity and the summer one's always the other.
8138720	8139720	Okay.
8139720	8140720	Doctors Without Borders.
8140720	8144760	Was it Final Fantasy six worlds collide randomizer.
8144760	8148800	That sounds cool.
8148800	8150200	I love the randomizers.
8150200	8151200	I would love to watch that.
8151200	8153680	I think the randomizer strategies are really interesting.
8153680	8157040	So those, those, those are the things I look forward to.
8157040	8162840	And um, off awful games or silly games or whatever they call it, the, the, the silly
8162840	8163840	game block.
8163840	8164840	Yeah.
8164840	8165840	Yeah.
8165840	8166840	Yeah.
8166840	8171840	I saw, um, there was a McDonald's game that looked pretty funny.
8171840	8176880	Um, I don't know.
8176880	8178680	Super Mario maker two relay races.
8178680	8179680	Those are always good.
8179680	8181240	Kaiser, super Metroid.
8181240	8182640	I want to see that.
8182640	8183680	Oh God.
8183680	8185720	That's going to be wild.
8185720	8188600	And super hot VR, but that'd be pretty exciting to watch.
8188600	8192240	And then they're going to do of course, Elden ring to cap it all off.
8192240	8193240	You know what?
8193240	8197340	I think y'all just need to watch the whole thing except a Sunday.
8197340	8200760	You know, they're going to need Sunday to get warmed up.
8200760	8204160	You know, it's the first one in person in a while, so let them get warmed up on Sunday
8204160	8208200	and then Monday on YouTube and be in both.
8208200	8209200	You could do both.
8209200	8212960	You could, you could catch on how many channels I lurk in at one time.
8212960	8213960	Yes.
8213960	8220280	Um, all the ones I watch.
8220280	8221280	It's not my fault.
8221280	8223280	I'm there first.
8223280	8224280	All right.
8224280	8227720	I think with that, it's about time to wrap up the show as so that dark soccer can do
8227720	8232360	her own stream and, uh, the rest of us can enjoy the rest of our weekend or what have
8232360	8233360	you.
8233360	8237880	Um, we'll be back in seven days to do it all again with the 20th anniversary show.
8237880	8243160	If you can believe we haven't been canceled after all these years, uh, before we do that,
8243160	8245120	we're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts.
8245120	8248840	Oh, I should say, of course, as I always do, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange
8248840	8252340	Lawn Studio, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
8252340	8254600	but we need more voices to put out here on air.
8254600	8257040	So, um, tell a friend or two about the show.
8257040	8259600	Tell somebody you don't like about the show because maybe they'll like it too.
8259600	8264200	A nice five star review, however you found this show, a nice five star review on a site
8264200	8267920	like iTunes, Spotify, wherever you found this, uh, would go a long way as well.
8267920	8271300	Uh, hosts on Twitch, followers on Twitch for VOG Network.
8271300	8272300	We'll take it all.
8272420	8274260	Um, thank you again so much for being here.
8274260	8275660	I appreciate you all.
8275660	8278180	Dark Sakura, your final thoughts tonight?
8278180	8283820	My final thought is that I follow this person called, uh, Eddie who, um, on Twitter who
8283820	8292300	does Dead by Daylight doujinshi and they are putting up for doujinshi right now and I am
8292300	8293460	going to be able to get them.
8293460	8294460	I'm very happy.
8294460	8295460	Awesome.
8295460	8296460	All right.
8296460	8297820	Have a good post stream.
8297820	8298820	We'll see you next time.
8298820	8299820	Later taters.
8299820	8300820	All right.
8301020	8303340	And uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?
8303340	8305700	I can't believe it's going to be 20 years next week.
8305700	8306700	I know.
8306700	8307700	Right?
8307700	8308940	Like literally where did the time go?
8308940	8310960	It's it's bonkers bananas.
8310960	8311960	That's for sure.
8311960	8314540	Uh, 20 years and no one still knows who we are.
8314540	8315540	Yay.
8315540	8316540	Yay.
8316540	8322180	Uh, my final thought is, um, you know, I was expecting a lot more tech hiccups tonight
8322180	8323180	and it did.
8323180	8327020	We definitely had a couple, but overall I'm very pleased with this investment in the new
8327020	8332900	computer and just the fact that having the nice fresh restart to clear out all the old
8332900	8337700	drivers and everything like it's just, it's nice and everything's running so smoothly.
8337700	8341280	I don't think we've missed hardly any frames tonight.
8341280	8345780	It's been very lovely and uh, yeah, I'm looking forward to being encouraged to get back into
8345780	8346900	streaming some more games.
8346900	8348500	I definitely have a backlog myself.
8348500	8350140	I do want to get into that.
8350140	8354620	So thank you for bearing with me while I've been waiting to have a computer that's a little
8354620	8356240	more capable of doing that.
8356240	8358280	So I'm out of excuses now.
8358280	8360240	Um, that's it.
8360240	8363840	We'll see you in seven days to do this all again.
8363840	8368040	Um, it's a pretty big week and I hope, I hope some blasts in the past will show up.
8368040	8369040	I hope you will show up.
8369040	8370320	Thank you so much for being here.
8370320	8372280	Um, have a great week everybody.
8372280	8373280	Bye.
