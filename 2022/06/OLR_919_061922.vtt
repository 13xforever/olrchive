WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.620
Do you hear that? All that furious typing? No? Right! Because the pace of news is down

00:15.620 --> 00:18.960
and the media's summer holiday started. At least until summer game sales and listicles

00:18.960 --> 00:22.400
start getting churned out. But don't worry, it's never a completely quiet week. The

00:22.400 --> 00:26.400
evergreen topics live up to their name, new collections, new legals, and bad decisions.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.640
Enough to fill time. Sort of like what I'm doing for this intro.

00:29.640 --> 00:32.660
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to bring you the news

00:32.660 --> 00:36.000
we do have. Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.300
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:44.300 --> 00:51.200
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

00:51.200 --> 00:59.440
number 919 of our show for tonight, June 19 of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I

00:59.440 --> 01:07.800
am joined as always by my co-hosts for the last 19.90 years because next week is a big

01:07.800 --> 01:11.440
number. First off, we have DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.440
Hi.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.440
Hi, how are you?

01:13.440 --> 01:16.200
I'm all right. How are you?

01:16.200 --> 01:20.600
I'm doing good. I was just obviously listening to Jason's intro and kind of laughing at

01:20.600 --> 01:24.040
that. It's a slow news week to this week in the gaming world. You know, we're coming

01:24.040 --> 01:29.120
off that not E3 period and the, you know, summer breaks and things. And there's a few

01:29.120 --> 01:37.440
things to talk about, but not a ton. And so, yeah, there's that. And then, so on top of

01:37.440 --> 01:43.480
that, then I'm thinking in the real world, there's actually a lot going on today. Juneteenth

01:43.480 --> 01:48.320
is today. Happy Juneteenth. Father's Day. Happy Father's Day to anybody that that applies

01:48.320 --> 01:54.600
to. Pride Month's still going on. It's probably somebody's birthday. What am I forgetting?

01:54.600 --> 01:59.920
There's a lot going on today. So busy, busy June 19th. So I'm happy, happy everything

01:59.920 --> 02:07.520
to all of you out there and play some video games to celebrate. Also want to say hello

02:07.520 --> 02:13.760
to Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki. Who for some reason I'm not hearing tonight. I don't know

02:13.760 --> 02:15.080
if it just cut out for a second.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.080
Made it, that's right.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.640
OK, you see, you got me thinking it's on my end. How are you doing, Loki?

02:19.120 --> 02:19.800
I'm doing fine.

02:19.920 --> 02:25.560
Good. So, yeah, there's a lot of a lot of weird tech odd stuff going on, and that is

02:25.560 --> 02:28.760
because I'm running on a new computer tonight.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.760
During the week this week, I actually got a new to me computer.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.480
I haven't upgraded my computer in the last five years.

02:36.320 --> 02:43.720
And Alan was very much like, I don't want to build a new computer because especially I

02:43.720 --> 02:44.800
don't want to do two.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.080
Can we just buy like a pre-build?

02:47.080 --> 02:48.720
And I was like, sure, let's do it.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.080
Let's buy a pre-build computer.

02:50.320 --> 02:55.160
And so we got matching computers from one of those pre-build companies.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.080
They didn't give it to me for free, so I'm not giving them an ad.

02:58.840 --> 03:01.080
It depends on what you consider expensive.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.640
I'll text you later.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.400
I'm not really comfortable saying the budget on air because, you know, it's yeah, some

03:06.400 --> 03:10.160
people are that's I've wanted to know relative to your to your ideas.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.480
Yeah, yeah, it's I would say it was on the pricier end.

03:13.800 --> 03:19.840
What we did, but we had some some work bonus type things, PTO cash out that we were able

03:19.840 --> 03:21.480
to do to make it work.

03:21.480 --> 03:25.760
So, yeah, so, yeah, we were able to do that.

03:25.760 --> 03:33.240
And actually, it's funny because Bobby Black Wolf actually helped before us here on O.L.R.

03:33.400 --> 03:38.160
because Alan, you know, he is more of a tech mindset, but he wanted a second pair of eyes

03:38.320 --> 03:40.960
and he's like, who else like builds computer stuff?

03:40.960 --> 03:43.360
And I mean, we know a lot of people that do that stuff.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.560
But, you know, it really gets into the weeds of that stuff.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.760
And so he thought of Bobby and I guess Bobby did give the computers his blessing.

03:49.120 --> 03:54.640
So whereas the new computer stuff is great and actually OBS with the import export

03:54.640 --> 03:58.800
functionality of the scenes made it really easy to carry most of the show stuff over.

03:59.240 --> 04:03.000
The audio stuff is really a little bit of a mess tonight.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.040
And what I'm also learning just now for the first time, a bad mistake I made.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.640
Oops, I forgot to install the stream deck software.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.680
But that's not very big or a long install.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.320
No, it's not. And I only really, really, really need it for one thing.

04:21.320 --> 04:25.640
And that is the little sidebar that shows when we're live on Twitch, because we do tape

04:25.640 --> 04:31.040
live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash vog network, the Voice of Geeks network,

04:31.040 --> 04:34.360
nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:34.360 --> 04:39.000
And the only thing I really need it for, I can control the scenes if I need to on my list

04:39.000 --> 04:42.640
in OBS, but I use it for the up and down for the right bar.

04:42.880 --> 04:47.680
Now, I do know of and Bobby is probably typing in chat right now, the plan B for that.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.840
I do know there is one.

04:48.840 --> 04:52.880
It's just a lot. It's a lot less convenient, but that's probably what I'll just have to do

04:52.880 --> 04:54.880
for the night until I can actually.

04:54.880 --> 04:59.800
But I knew it's those little things like that I was going to discover as we were going on

05:00.040 --> 05:01.160
through the show tonight.

05:02.880 --> 05:08.360
Looking in chat, Bobby Black Wolf says, Alan gave me the three finalists and I told him I

05:08.360 --> 05:09.280
won two and three.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.560
Yes, they played the computer dating game, basically, which was nice.

05:13.200 --> 05:17.520
And Quest Buster says pricey right now, but that's an investment for the years ahead.

05:17.760 --> 05:18.520
Absolutely.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.920
And I'm going to be perfectly honest.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.200
We're new homeowners and we kind of had a discussion.

05:23.760 --> 05:28.600
We could really use a new kitchen table, but do we want a new kitchen table right now or is

05:28.600 --> 05:30.120
the one that we're using good enough?

05:30.240 --> 05:33.960
And honestly, we kind of need new computers because the computers are what we use more

05:33.960 --> 05:35.160
than anything.

05:35.360 --> 05:39.880
And I think Alan has been feeling a little bit creatively stagnant because he was streaming

05:39.880 --> 05:41.120
on Twitch for a long time.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.120
He stopped for the last little bit.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.440
And I think it's because he was getting frustrated, like the technical limitations of the

05:46.440 --> 05:52.560
computer. And, you know, he can't stream things like Elden Ring because the computer he had

05:52.560 --> 05:55.960
wouldn't run it. Well, trust me, this new one will run it and he can stream it if he

05:55.960 --> 05:58.640
wants whenever he decides to get back up and running with that.

05:58.640 --> 06:03.440
So the same goes for me, really, is I don't have to rely on my Xbox Series X to stream

06:03.440 --> 06:06.280
everything. I should be able to do a lot more on the PC.

06:06.800 --> 06:12.400
On that note, I also saw in chat over Twitch.tv slash Vaga Network, somebody had

06:12.400 --> 06:16.920
suggested, oh, you should start streaming OLR in 1080p.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.800
And actually, I did have this, actually, no, it was Alan that said that early on.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.600
I did have that same thought early on because I was like, oh, that would be fun.

06:24.840 --> 06:25.960
But here's the thing.

06:25.960 --> 06:32.240
Because we aren't partner, Twitch doesn't down sample the stream for everyone else.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.320
So if I broadcast at 1080, everybody would be forced to watch at 1080.

06:37.600 --> 06:43.320
And that might not work with your bandwidth and your Wi-Fi and the way many of you tune

06:43.320 --> 06:44.800
into the show on Sunday nights.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.240
It wouldn't affect anybody on the podcast feed, but I want to be mindful of those that

06:48.240 --> 06:49.640
are here on Sunday nights as well.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.040
And so that's why I chose not to go that route.

06:52.040 --> 06:55.880
However, I did bump it back up to 60 frames a second.

06:55.920 --> 07:00.200
We were only on 30 frames a second, and I'm not sure 60 frames is going to change that

07:00.200 --> 07:02.280
much. But there you go.

07:02.280 --> 07:06.440
I did throw that little, but we're going to still be in 720p for a little bit.

07:06.760 --> 07:15.400
So Bobby actually does say, oh, Twitch does down sample, but it's not guaranteed.

07:15.560 --> 07:20.960
And that's honestly the lack of guarantee is enough for me because the one night I

07:20.960 --> 07:25.960
decide to do 1080p, it'll be, oh, say the 20th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.360
And then people are saying, I can't hear it.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.040
I can't hear it. The show's a flop.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.520
And all that stuff.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.880
So, all right.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.880
Anyhow, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.640
There's a lot of stuff going on in gaming.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.120
No, there's not. But we're going to pretend there is.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.840
There's a couple big headlines, at least.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.480
So let's get into the big headlines and we'll start with tonight's kickoff topic.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.360
We'll go over to Loki, who's going to start us off tonight.

07:54.120 --> 08:01.560
Yeah, so they did a this is kind of the second part of key three, the not E3 event

08:01.560 --> 08:08.360
that takes place around Summer Game Fest, but Square Enix had their Final Fantasy 7

08:08.360 --> 08:13.480
25th anniversary live stream and they announced stuff for that.

08:13.480 --> 08:19.960
So, of course, the next being the next part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake, which is now

08:20.320 --> 08:25.240
Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and it's continuing on the story there.

08:25.240 --> 08:28.880
And then they said that's going to be coming out, I believe next fall.

08:29.720 --> 08:34.720
And along with that, they confirmed that it is a three part series that's going to be

08:34.720 --> 08:39.200
which kind of we figure as much since the first part kind of took place.

08:40.160 --> 08:45.320
Which, you know, back in the original version of it, like the first disc of the of the game.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.320
So, you know, they're they're going to make it three parts.

08:49.720 --> 08:55.960
And then along with that, of course, we've got them remaking the.

08:57.040 --> 09:03.880
Was that Final Fantasy seven crisis core is going to be remade as well, and that's coming

09:03.880 --> 09:04.840
out this year.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.520
So this fall, which is kind of interesting.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.440
But yeah, I mean, it looks good.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.720
I need to finish playing through it.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.040
Oh, you never finished the remake?

09:15.800 --> 09:16.360
I didn't.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.080
Oh, it's so good.

09:18.160 --> 09:18.880
Well, I have.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.360
OK, so here's the thing.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.560
People have been calling this game Final Fantasy seven remake part two.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.480
And now we know that that isn't really going to be the name.

09:27.480 --> 09:33.280
And it's some of the takes on social media have me kind of wondering who's got a hot take

09:33.280 --> 09:38.160
that actually hasn't played the Final Fantasy seven remake, because I'm going to tell you

09:38.160 --> 09:40.240
what I believe is a minor plot spoiler.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.800
But at this point, Loki, I'm sorry, it's been out for two years.

09:44.120 --> 09:48.160
I feel if the plot points are sensitive, you would have played it by now.

09:48.160 --> 09:48.880
Here's the thing.

09:50.280 --> 09:56.080
If you play through the game, the whole gag about it being a remake is a plot point.

09:57.320 --> 10:03.360
And the fact that the game there is a certain legacy and a certain set of rules that the

10:03.360 --> 10:09.160
game feels like it has to live up to, and there comes a very clear part in the game where

10:09.160 --> 10:12.000
the game says we are going to deviate from this.

10:12.480 --> 10:18.280
And what happens is that a major character is killed who is not supposed to be killed.

10:19.600 --> 10:25.040
And what happens is that basically a outside force and I'm not going to get into everything

10:25.720 --> 10:30.760
kind of rewinds that incident so that that doesn't happen, because when that originally

10:30.760 --> 10:37.480
happens, it's like a what the fuck moment, because that person doesn't die.

10:38.440 --> 10:44.920
For what you know, but that was the game setting the rules to say, this is not the same Final

10:44.920 --> 10:46.640
Fantasy 7 you knew.

10:47.840 --> 10:53.600
This is a Final Fantasy 7 multi, I would say this whole multiverse phenomenon that we've

10:53.600 --> 10:56.440
seen with the Doctor Strange, everything everywhere all at once.

10:56.680 --> 11:02.400
This is really what Final Fantasy 7 is kind of at now is that this is a Final Fantasy 7

11:02.400 --> 11:08.760
separate, Final Fantasy 7 separate universe where a different series of events has taken

11:08.760 --> 11:09.320
place.

11:09.680 --> 11:15.280
And it kind of compounds that when you get towards the end of the game and a series of

11:15.280 --> 11:19.600
events that happens at the end of the game that kind of shows like, wait a minute now, and

11:19.600 --> 11:25.200
this is why it's important that Crisis Core is coming out again, because there's a series of

11:25.200 --> 11:30.720
events where it's like, wait a minute, this isn't the way it played out in Final Fantasy 7.

11:31.720 --> 11:36.680
So yes, fifth dream in chat says, then it's a redo, not a remake.

11:36.800 --> 11:37.800
Absolutely.

11:37.960 --> 11:43.000
And I think a really appropriate way to phrase it is that it's a rebirth.

11:43.360 --> 11:50.000
And that's why I think this title that they have for part two is super appropriate, because it's

11:50.000 --> 11:51.560
Final Fantasy 7 rebirth.

11:51.720 --> 11:55.000
And so everybody's asking, well, is Aerith going to die?

11:55.000 --> 11:55.920
Is Aerith going to die?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.480
It's not guaranteed.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.360
I don't think she will.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.120
Well, I'm not sure.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.920
I'm not so sure I'm going to hedge my bets on that.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.320
They'll kill her and then they'll rewind time again and kill her again.

12:11.240 --> 12:11.880
Maybe.

12:12.080 --> 12:12.680
I don't know.

12:12.880 --> 12:19.160
And I think now that's the big question mark is, is the game going to play out the way we expect

12:19.160 --> 12:19.560
it to?

12:19.560 --> 12:21.280
Because the answer is already no.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.120
And so everything is up for renegotiation.

12:25.720 --> 12:30.200
Every, you know, and there's this whole fact that, like, you know, you had the whole side story, the

12:30.200 --> 12:33.040
DLC, which, to be fair, I have not played through.

12:33.240 --> 12:38.880
But we all know that Yuffie was not in the original game early on in the Midgar component, but they

12:38.880 --> 12:40.400
introduced her here in like a side.

12:40.400 --> 12:45.160
Meanwhile, in another part of the galaxy, I thought there was a way to get her in Midgar.

12:45.160 --> 12:48.840
Like there was like a little playground area that there's a very small chance to get her.

12:48.880 --> 12:49.560
I thought.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.160
Maybe, but we'll just say unintentionally.

12:54.200 --> 12:58.080
That's not like or like that's not really the way most people experience that game.

12:58.080 --> 12:58.400
Right.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.600
And so it's very different in this remake.

13:02.600 --> 13:08.720
So I just I think we need to stop calling this the Final Fantasy seven remake series, because if you

13:08.720 --> 13:12.400
played the first game, you already know this is not a shot for shot remake.

13:12.600 --> 13:21.400
And I thought I quite frankly, I thought it was quite frankly genius in the game that they made the

13:21.440 --> 13:26.120
expectations of doing a remake of Final Fantasy seven a plot point.

13:27.920 --> 13:33.640
Because when I was playing through the game, Alan walked into the room and he was like, you know what

13:33.640 --> 13:41.720
this is, he says this this is this is Nomura, this is a representation of the fans in the game.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.400
He said this is Nomura's fans telling him he can't do this.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.720
By golly, he kind of nailed it.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.400
Like he called what it was like early on.

13:49.440 --> 13:56.360
So I just I that's why I actually thought Final Fantasy seven remake actually was really, really

13:56.360 --> 13:59.760
good, is that it is not a shot for shot remake of Final Fantasy seven.

13:59.760 --> 14:05.000
And when you kind of get to that point, you start to sort of realize, oh, the whole like we're

14:05.000 --> 14:13.480
remaking a legendary game and having to live up to the pressures of that is a plot point.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.600
I actually think it's brilliant.

14:14.600 --> 14:22.760
So anyway, so it's remake, rebirth, and then I'm sure the third part will be re coded, re reborn,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.120
re resurrected.

14:25.360 --> 14:25.880
I don't know.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.080
So but I'm sure.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.240
Oh, you know what?

14:28.560 --> 14:29.680
That's that's it.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.360
I think that's where it ends up going.

14:32.640 --> 14:38.960
Aerith dies, but then they realize that they can change these sorts of fates and Final Fantasy seven

14:38.960 --> 14:40.760
resurrected is bringing her back.

14:42.960 --> 14:43.760
That's my bet.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.040
So we'll see.

14:47.080 --> 14:53.120
But I am excited to give Crisis Core and all that stuff, I play because I didn't really play through

14:53.120 --> 14:56.400
it and when it was originally on PSP or any of that anyway.

14:56.400 --> 15:03.840
So Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the end of remake talks a lot about destiny and how certain

15:03.840 --> 15:07.880
characters know what destiny is and how we're going against destiny.

15:08.080 --> 15:08.640
Yes.

15:08.960 --> 15:15.160
And that was it was a little more subtle in the original Final Fantasy seven, but it really beat

15:15.160 --> 15:19.720
you over the head with it in the remake, and that is the fact that Aerith knew she was going to die

15:19.720 --> 15:21.400
and Sephiroth knew he was going to kill her.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.640
And that in the original Final Fantasy seven, it's more subtle.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.720
It's something you don't really figure it out until the end.

15:29.040 --> 15:35.840
But in the remake, you are it's very explicit that this is something that they know through the

15:35.840 --> 15:36.160
game.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.600
So anyway, I know a lot of you might be going, oh, Rob, it's been two years.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.360
I haven't played the game.

15:41.360 --> 15:41.920
Why did you have to?

15:42.040 --> 15:49.320
Because I'm at a point where I can't let this social media discussion continue from uninformed

15:49.320 --> 15:53.480
individuals who continue to still think this is a literal remake of the game.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.560
And if you haven't got if you've gone the two years and reimaging, yeah, if you've gone the two

15:58.560 --> 16:02.360
years and not played it, then you've told me it's not that much of a high priority to you.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.000
And I need to clear the air.

16:04.760 --> 16:08.920
This once you play the remake, you will understand it is not a remake.

16:09.840 --> 16:13.520
It's a it's a reimagining, a recoding, all those words.

16:13.760 --> 16:20.400
So anyway, Tiger Claw in chat says we've seen stuff like this before, where a character we thought

16:20.400 --> 16:25.080
died was brought back in a follow up and explained how this person somehow survived.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.200
Oh, it happens in movies and stuff all the time, right?

16:28.200 --> 16:33.040
Or or they magically come back through a videotape like Randy and the Scream movies or something

16:33.040 --> 16:38.440
like that. Or, you know, now or they're talking about trying to get Matthew Lillard back in the

16:38.440 --> 16:41.840
Scream franchise. It's like he very clearly died in the first movie.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.800
Well, no one's really dead in a horror movie now, are they?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.080
Right. So, yeah.

16:46.520 --> 16:50.280
Oh, Bobby Black Wolf also points out Star Trek 2009.

16:50.560 --> 16:56.640
That's an excellent comparison to what's happening in the Final Fantasy 7 universe.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.520
That is an excellent, excellent comparison.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.920
Does the Star Trek reimagined?

17:00.320 --> 17:03.800
Hmm. Although it is technically an alternate universe.

17:04.840 --> 17:06.040
That is true. Yeah, yeah.

17:06.040 --> 17:12.440
Well, yeah, it's very explicitly an alternate universe where Final Fantasy 7 isn't as explicit with that.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.040
But yeah, the Kelvin universe or whatever you want to call it.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.920
But then then the gag is and why not?

17:17.920 --> 17:20.120
Why don't I spoil a Star Trek movie, too?

17:20.520 --> 17:24.560
Then when Star Trek, the second one came out, what was the one with Benedict Cumberbatch?

17:24.560 --> 17:25.920
What was the subtitle of that?

17:25.920 --> 17:27.880
Star Trek Beyond? No, that was third one was Beyond.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.400
Star Trek Insurrection was the next one, Into Darkness.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.400
OK. Into Darkness.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.560
So plot twist for Into Darkness.

17:35.560 --> 17:37.560
Into Darkness is just the Wrath of Khan.

17:38.560 --> 17:42.320
But they don't tell you that until the end, but they do.

17:42.320 --> 17:50.600
But then that one kind of beats you over the head with it because they're kind of like these very clear plot points that happen in Star Trek, the Wrath of Khan.

17:50.600 --> 17:57.200
They were like, OK, OK, but what if, what if Kirk and Spock had their roles reversed?

17:58.880 --> 18:05.120
And that's why I thought that movie was kind of lame, is that they should adjust from the start, said they were doing a Wrath of Khan remake.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.440
That's I don't know. Anyway, all right.

18:09.600 --> 18:15.520
I'm getting off track, but I just yeah, I think this Final Fantasy 7 stuff is I'm a spoiler madman.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.320
OK, but literally, how old is that Star Trek movie?

18:18.320 --> 18:19.440
It's over 10 years old.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.120
For an age, the statute of limitations as long as it's passed.

18:23.120 --> 18:23.600
It is.

18:23.600 --> 18:28.560
I really think when it comes to video games, like six months is about the statute of limitations.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.000
And it's been like two years.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.320
So just just wanted to say so.

18:33.360 --> 18:38.160
All right. Yeah. Bobby says we wanted to do a spoiler cast on Final Fantasy 7 remake after we both finished it.

18:38.160 --> 18:42.080
And yeah, it just we never really able to coordinate.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.160
And a lot of that is on me.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.840
So but yeah, Bobby says Rob and I geeked out over the ending.

18:45.840 --> 18:46.600
True, we did.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.920
And like because Bobby and I both played it and then we were like talking to each other on phones.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.920
It's like I can't talk about this on OLR because I don't want to ruin it for people.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.080
But this is so brilliant.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.960
This is so like this is not what I expected to happen.

18:56.960 --> 18:57.640
It's so good.

18:57.640 --> 19:01.200
So but I am intentionally so that you do have a reason to play it.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.880
Those of you that haven't done it over the last two years.

19:03.040 --> 19:06.840
I'm not telling you what all the changes are that they made because it is interesting.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.440
So experience that part for yourselves.

19:10.480 --> 19:14.920
But yes, I'm I'm glad they're not calling it Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 2.

19:14.920 --> 19:20.520
And in my opinion, anyone that's telling you it should be Remake Part 2 did not play the first game.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.160
All right.

19:23.000 --> 19:23.400
All right.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.120
Thank you, chat.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.360
Now they're spoiling everything.

19:25.360 --> 19:25.840
All right.

19:25.840 --> 19:26.520
Thank you.

19:27.920 --> 19:31.520
Gamer Xtafur in chat says, Can I spoil Returnal for everyone then?

19:31.520 --> 19:34.400
I love that game and don't mind ruining a few people's dreams.

19:34.680 --> 19:39.720
I would prefer you didn't because I still don't have a PS5, but I guess you are past the statute of limitations.

19:40.040 --> 19:40.920
Why don't you do this?

19:40.920 --> 19:45.360
Xtafur, if you have to spoil someone, text me, but don't ruin the chat.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.680
And by the way, it's good to see you.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.360
I haven't played it, but you can ruin it for me.

19:50.360 --> 19:59.640
I'll be OK because I also know I see like spoilers for Drag Race and Survivor and stuff, and I still watch it because usually the journey is how to get there.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.320
So if it's a good story.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.760
Isn't that the definition of a journey?

20:03.840 --> 20:05.480
Yes, exactly.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.200
Or yeah, and E3VL talks about Darth Vader is Luke's father.

20:09.600 --> 20:14.000
Anyone our age knows that and probably knew that before.

20:14.000 --> 20:23.400
Well, maybe not quite our age because some of us did get to see it in the theater as kids, but most people around our age probably knew that the first time they saw Empire Strikes Back.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.200
I know I did.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.160
Did that ruin the movie?

20:25.160 --> 20:26.200
I saw that in the theater.

20:26.200 --> 20:26.480
No.

20:27.000 --> 20:27.280
Yeah.

20:27.280 --> 20:31.200
I was young, but I saw it in the theater.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.800
Actually, I saw Star Wars when I was nine months old, so.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.400
And it was quite a revelation at the time, right?

20:36.440 --> 20:36.920
Oh, yeah.

20:36.960 --> 20:37.400
Oh, yeah.

20:37.440 --> 20:37.760
It was huge.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.720
Well, I mean, not that I know anything about it since I was nine months old.

20:46.240 --> 20:54.880
I was I mean, it's probably the reason why Return of the Jedi is my favorite, because I was actually old enough to have more of a formative memory of seeing it.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.200
Or take the movie Titanic.

20:58.680 --> 21:03.560
Yes, the boat sinks because it's based on that historical event.

21:03.560 --> 21:07.640
But even if you took the fiction part, she's an old lady at the beginning.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.120
You know, she lives through the event.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.840
You don't see Jack anywhere as an old man.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.920
You can guess what happens to Jack.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.640
Jack knocked her up and ran off the bum.

21:22.120 --> 21:22.720
All right.

21:23.040 --> 21:27.440
Yeah, in the real version, he sat on the thing with her and they didn't get hypothermia.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.080
And then he was like, oh, you know what?

21:29.080 --> 21:29.920
I don't like you anymore.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.160
Bye.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.000
That's that's the passion of the Christ.

21:32.000 --> 21:32.560
I did not.

21:32.560 --> 21:38.200
Well, talk about fiction.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.480
That's that's the oh, my God.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.600
That's the like multiverse movie I want to see.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.360
Not Passion of the Christ, but Titanic.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.200
I don't need to see torture porn.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.560
That's all the passion of the Christ was.

21:50.560 --> 21:56.560
But I would I would love to see Titanic, but like the multiverse version that like plays out completely differently.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.440
I would love that.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.800
They address that in Supernatural.

21:58.800 --> 21:59.840
Oh, do they?

22:00.600 --> 22:11.800
And and yeah, in this one episode of Supernatural and all because of the Titanic, the the Sam and Dean did not have an Impala.

22:11.800 --> 22:15.320
They had a Mustang, which is actually supposed to be the original car they were supposed to drive.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.560
Celine Dion did not become famous for the song.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.200
In fact, no one knew who she was.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.680
She was a lounge singer in Canada.

22:21.680 --> 22:29.440
And they were like they they had like all these extra people existing in the universe.

22:29.440 --> 22:32.760
That was sort of the reason why they saved the Titanic was to get extra people born.

22:34.560 --> 22:40.720
But it was it was pretty funny, like some of the differences that episode was really, really good.

22:40.720 --> 22:47.120
It was also it's funny getting to see, you know, one of the fates to out some angels.

22:48.120 --> 22:52.400
Some folks in chat talking about what the multiverse of Titanic might look like.

22:52.400 --> 22:57.160
Tiger Claw saying a multiverse of Titanic in which a universe the Titanic never sank.

22:57.560 --> 23:01.640
You have to be careful walking that line because it was based on a historical event.

23:01.640 --> 23:02.680
People really did die.

23:02.680 --> 23:06.560
We don't want to be disrespectful, but we can poke all the fun we want at the fictional elements of that.

23:06.800 --> 23:15.600
However, I also know that there has been plenty of interesting science fiction type of stories told about major historical events going a different way.

23:15.840 --> 23:18.280
Like that is a major plot point in a lot of things.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.240
So it doesn't have to be disrespectful.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.280
It's just kind of it's just a careful line to walk.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.080
That's all I'm saying.

23:25.000 --> 23:40.640
But the other thing, too, like thinking, though, just like realistically, you know, if the Titanic hadn't sank or the Olympic or the other ones also like that, that we probably wouldn't have the same safety laws on major sea vessels that we do now.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.680
You're absolutely right.

23:41.840 --> 23:42.440
You're absolutely right.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.200
Let's see other comments.

23:44.320 --> 23:53.960
Quest Buster now talks about the total like camp version of that alt history stuff, saying in raise the Titanic, they raise the Titanic to build an anti missile shield.

23:53.960 --> 23:54.680
Not joking.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.320
Yeah, let's see.

23:56.720 --> 24:02.040
Gamer extra for says, anyway, my takeaway from this is that Rose is a murderer in the Alpha Titanic verse.

24:02.920 --> 24:03.960
Yeah, yeah.

24:04.760 --> 24:09.840
So one other interesting thing, one of my favorite channels is Ask a Mortician.

24:10.520 --> 24:13.120
Oh, and oh, yeah.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.400
Her channel is fantastic.

24:14.400 --> 24:19.960
And also that British drag queen who does all the impersonations did her to it was beautiful.

24:21.560 --> 24:31.240
But she she did one about what happened to the bodies and pretty much the bodies have disintegrated.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.000
Oh, wow.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.320
Because of the underwater pressure.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

24:36.680 --> 24:37.560
And makes sense.

24:38.040 --> 24:40.960
But that's why they would find pairs of shoes.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.960
Just by themselves, pair of shoes.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.520
Bobby Blackwell says Jamie's learning where to hide your body.

24:48.520 --> 24:49.040
Be nice.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.880
Well, you know, it's I already know a lot of ways to hide a body.

24:51.920 --> 24:57.080
I hope this topic isn't too weird for people, but I want to assure everyone I'm very comfortable talking about this.

24:57.400 --> 25:01.760
I have a friend that I met through Rocky Horror who happens to be a mortician.

25:02.320 --> 25:15.640
And when my mom passed away, I found that it was actually a really like it was a really good friend to have because he was able to walk me through all these things that are very difficult about the cremation and all that stuff.

25:15.960 --> 25:19.880
And I knew I wasn't going to be taken advantage of, like with up sales or anything like that.

25:19.880 --> 25:25.440
Like he really was just able to very plainly and effectively tell me and walk me through these steps.

25:25.440 --> 25:31.800
And like, there was like such a comfort in that that I can't like articulate very well.

25:31.800 --> 25:36.000
But like, I really he sometimes comes into Twitch and watches some of these things.

25:36.000 --> 25:44.640
I don't know if he watches OLR, but if he happens to be out there, I just want to say I know we don't talk every day, but I really appreciated that in that moment and having that comfort and so forth.

25:44.640 --> 25:51.480
So sometimes it's good to know a mortician and keep some of those tips around because it's one of those things you don't want to use.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.800
But when you need it, it's nice.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.760
Sometimes it's also good to just be Jewish.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.800
Well, faith and religion certainly play a lot.

26:01.800 --> 26:02.880
No, there's a reason.

26:03.040 --> 26:05.840
Oh, 24 hour burial in a pine box.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.520
Yeah, very clear, very clear, very color guidelines.

26:10.520 --> 26:10.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.240
Yep, I'm down for that.

26:13.240 --> 26:17.040
Although honestly, I'm going to do the tree pod thing and be planted on federal land.

26:18.920 --> 26:23.400
Seriously, if bodies are buried on federal land, it can't be reclaimed for development.

26:24.800 --> 26:29.360
Gamer Extifer, on the final note on Titanic here, and then I swear we're moving on.

26:29.360 --> 26:39.080
Gamer Extifer says, fun fact, it's common for shoes to wash up on shore with human feet in them because they're the first things to break apart from bodies that get thrown or drown in the ocean.

26:39.320 --> 26:42.800
For instance, probably Jack's foot because Rose murdered him.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.320
That's a fun fact.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.680
Did you notice that his finger breaks off when she lets go of his hand?

26:49.280 --> 26:50.440
No.

26:51.440 --> 26:58.840
I recognized it the first time I saw the movie that like, it was like his thumb or his finger broke off when she let him go into the water.

26:58.840 --> 27:02.920
Are we sure it wasn't a piece of ice that just wasn't clear in 1997 HD?

27:02.960 --> 27:03.640
Wow.

27:03.880 --> 27:04.720
It was a finger.

27:04.720 --> 27:13.160
It was basically this wax model that we have made of him has a faulty finger, either that or a hyper, hyperthermia.

27:13.200 --> 27:13.760
Yeah.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.600
Hyperthermia.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.920
All right, yeah, Dr. Seuss just needs more energy.

27:17.000 --> 27:25.840
I love morbid topics like this for the record, and we need to have like another community redeem that's called like, Orange Lounge Morbidio.

27:25.960 --> 27:30.880
We still have to make good on the foodie-o redeem, and I keep meaning to schedule that.

27:30.880 --> 27:36.240
And then it's like, oh, I'm going to get a new computer and throw everything into, you know, but let's get through the foodie-o.

27:36.240 --> 27:43.840
We could do the Memento Mori edition of the Orange Lounge Radio where we just talk about all things death because we know what Memento Mori means.

27:43.840 --> 27:44.720
I'm sorry, DJ Ramah.

27:44.720 --> 27:45.840
A reminder of death.

27:45.840 --> 27:48.400
DJ Ramah S in chat says, it's morbid time.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.400
I'll see if my friend will come on the show that week.

27:54.400 --> 27:54.680
That'd be cool.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.240
That might be fun.

27:55.240 --> 27:55.640
All right.

27:56.280 --> 28:05.040
Anyway, it would actually be cool to have your friend on when I, when I get my Dead by Daylight thing going, the in-character, the in-character conversation.

28:05.200 --> 28:10.800
You actually probably know him, but I'll text you to see I'm not talking about people who aren't here.

28:11.160 --> 28:11.800
So, okay.

28:12.200 --> 28:18.880
But anyway, I like, uh, the, the science of death, but I hate the economy of it.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.080
Yes.

28:20.160 --> 28:20.560
Yes.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.480
All right, let's move on.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.640
Uh, oh, Bobby says two things.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.360
Rob needs to check J text Jamie about now.

28:27.560 --> 28:28.520
Text her one.

28:28.560 --> 28:32.120
See, we multitask here on this show and there's three of us do.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.960
And I mean, I'm on a Mac.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.560
I can just open my messages.

28:35.560 --> 28:36.840
I don't have to look at my phone.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.040
Y'all have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.600
I could be reading fan fiction.

28:41.840 --> 28:46.680
I could be plotting, you know, the overthrow of the country because I could run it better.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.320
Um, I mean, I'm not going to do any of those things.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.160
That's hypothetical.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.640
I could do the work zoom call.

28:52.640 --> 28:52.920
Oops.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.720
I could do the work zoom call thing and have my phone here.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.280
Oh, just barely off the camera.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.400
I could do that, but.

28:59.440 --> 29:04.240
And hey, I work in my pajamas and I draw art while I work.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.040
I'm not wearing pants right now.

29:06.640 --> 29:07.440
I'm not either.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.000
No, I'm just kidding.

29:09.000 --> 29:09.880
I have jeans on.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.640
I have jeans on everybody.

29:11.640 --> 29:12.640
I went out walking.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.120
Okay.

29:13.760 --> 29:14.080
All right.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.360
I'm, I'm wearing shorts.

29:16.560 --> 29:17.080
All right.

29:17.320 --> 29:17.720
It's fine.

29:17.720 --> 29:18.400
Pajama shorts.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.200
Dress comfortably.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.000
All right, let's move on.

29:21.000 --> 29:27.120
We got to get, move on with the show and let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

29:27.360 --> 29:27.840
Dark soccer.

29:27.840 --> 29:28.440
I'm going to start with you.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.200
How was your gaming week?

29:30.120 --> 29:31.520
Um, it was eventful.

29:32.080 --> 29:32.400
Hold on.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.600
I'm, I'm telling dark Tetsuya that it's our show and we'll talk about what we want.

29:38.680 --> 29:39.320
There you go.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.000
So anyway,

29:41.240 --> 29:47.920
I love how you had to say it on air and in chat as if there's a chance start to see it doesn't have his audio on right now.

29:48.760 --> 29:56.840
No, I, I, I have to reiterate because I'm feeling, I'm feeling a little bit sassy and we can talk about anything we want to.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.080
We can talk about corpses.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.200
We can talk about hemorrhoids.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.640
We can talk about colonoscopies.

30:00.640 --> 30:03.960
We can talk about like, the hemophilia.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.240
We can talk about anything medical or real life that we want to.

30:07.760 --> 30:08.040
Okay.

30:08.040 --> 30:08.360
Okay.

30:08.360 --> 30:12.480
Loki, this is also the first time that I think I've mentioned a colonoscopy on the show.

30:12.480 --> 30:13.680
So, Hey, there you go.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.920
Loki, what do you want to talk about?

30:14.920 --> 30:16.720
Do you want to talk about your colon or you want to talk about something else?

30:17.440 --> 30:19.520
Wait, Loki talked about a colonoscopy before, right?

30:20.080 --> 30:22.360
No, no, someone did.

30:23.280 --> 30:27.960
No, that was like, you're thinking the kidney stone issues.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.200
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:29.560 --> 30:29.920
Okay.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.040
That goes up the other side.

30:33.440 --> 30:33.720
Yeah.

30:34.040 --> 30:34.520
Well, okay.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.280
So I have, I have gaming stuff.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.720
And a little bit of expansion on some gaming stuff.

30:39.720 --> 30:42.000
We do sell this as a video game podcast.

30:42.000 --> 30:42.920
So it would be nice.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.400
What the fuck is going on this week, right?

30:45.400 --> 30:56.320
I also want to point out if our 20th anniversary should get any media traction, which I doubt it will, but if it does, this is the show people are going to hear leading up to the 20th anniversary.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.280
So make it count kids.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.440
You know what?

31:01.640 --> 31:02.240
Reasons.

31:02.680 --> 31:03.120
Anyway.

31:04.120 --> 31:14.080
So at any rate, um, I have, I actually, I played Terra Nigma on Wednesday and I got it to the point where I'm just about to beat the game.

31:14.320 --> 31:14.720
Nice.

31:14.800 --> 31:21.160
So I have stopped and I've put up a poll for what my next game is going to be.

31:21.760 --> 31:26.000
And so I believe that final fantasy six went out.

31:26.360 --> 31:32.800
Uh, between final fantasy four and final fantasy six, I would, I'm actually looking for a direct translation.

31:34.080 --> 31:38.560
I would like my, I voted sticker because I voted for final fantasy four in that poll.

31:39.640 --> 31:45.760
Um, at any rate though, I mean, it's either of them are fantastic games.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.600
I love to be playing either.

31:47.880 --> 31:51.000
Um, but I'm actually thinking the one after that to be star ocean.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.440
We had a lot of people interested in me playing star ocean.

31:55.440 --> 32:06.000
So, um, but going, uh, back, I've decided that since it is the sixth anniversary for dead by daylight and it's only a two week thing, or as I said, a 13 day thing.

32:06.840 --> 32:19.200
Um, I'm basically all of my streams are going to be dead by daylight until it's over, uh, just so that I can make sure I've maximized, uh, my, my blood points and gotten all the goodies.

32:19.240 --> 32:29.760
And I had a really fun game, uh, last night on stream where, uh, I was playing pig because I'm a pig main and I don't care what anybody says she's S tier God level.

32:30.680 --> 32:40.280
Um, and I decided, and I, there's like one of those, uh, like rift quests to do where you have to find one of the invitation pillars.

32:40.280 --> 32:45.320
So basically in the game, you find these pillars that move around at random that have an invitation on them.

32:45.720 --> 32:54.840
And when you interact with it, it unlocks a masquerade mask for 12 different characters in the game, you know, all unique to those characters.

32:55.280 --> 32:59.280
And I had to do one of those and they were really hard to find.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.080
Like I only had six at that point.

33:01.560 --> 33:06.280
So I, uh, I went on pig, so, you know, relatively speedy character.

33:06.680 --> 33:15.720
I went on, um, and I actually had dead dog, which is I think the smallest map, like the smallest single level map.

33:17.120 --> 33:20.000
And basically I just ran around ignoring the survivors.

33:20.000 --> 33:25.560
I mean, like I hit a couple of people just, you know, because one of them was a Steven, a Steve and you always hit a Steve.

33:26.280 --> 33:30.240
Um, and then I just started wondering around looking for the, uh, the thing.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.720
And so they're like, Oh, it's a pig player, boop, boop.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.160
And I'm like, okay, get your boops.

33:34.160 --> 33:39.600
And then I would turn around and go back to looking for, for the pillar until they realized I was looking for the pillar.

33:41.480 --> 33:45.280
So they're like walking along with me, helping me look for the pillar.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.680
And someone came and got me and said, there it is.

33:47.680 --> 33:53.240
You know, and I was like, cause you know, they can point and I looked over, there's like, Oh my gosh, I almost walked right past it.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.960
And cause since it moves, you have to be really quick on it.

33:56.040 --> 34:02.440
And I was just like, but it's something that I love about Dead by Daylight, the people that play it.

34:03.120 --> 34:11.360
I mean, yeah, you can get like really bully terrible people, you know, that are playing against you and people who don't want to meme with you or any of that.

34:11.720 --> 34:18.040
And then you find the people who seem to understand what you're trying to do and help you do it.

34:18.160 --> 34:20.440
The nonverbal cue stuff is huge.

34:20.440 --> 34:26.840
And you know, it ties into your classic game of the week, last week or the week before was, was Journey from the PlayStation 3.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.040
And that was a huge part of that game.

34:29.080 --> 34:36.600
I would say Dead by Daylight actually kind of takes its cues from Journey in that regard, where you had like those, that like chirp button is the only way you could communicate with players.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.000
But in Dead by Daylight, it's either point or come here.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.480
And that's like all the only like two things you can do.

34:42.480 --> 34:49.000
So it's really, well, but dance or yeah, you can kind of nods, spins like there are some other things you can do.

34:49.040 --> 34:55.120
But for the most part, you're limited to those nonverbal cues and killers have less people get really creative with that.

34:55.480 --> 35:00.680
Yeah, like the things that I've learned is that if you're going to help somebody out, you give them the notters.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.920
If you don't want to meme around, you shake your head, right?

35:05.880 --> 35:11.080
If if you want someone to do an action, you attack the item.

35:11.080 --> 35:18.840
Like if I want someone to drop a pallet on me because I had that one where you have to be in chase and have a pallet dropped on you and you break the pallet and then go after them.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.080
So I would go back and just hit the pallet and say, hey, hit this.

35:22.320 --> 35:31.560
Or if I wanted to let somebody go, I would, you know, or wanted someone to do gens or farm or something, I would hit the generator just with my normal weapon and then kick it.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.440
And then, you know, go back and forth, you know, different things like that.

35:34.440 --> 35:41.880
Or if, you know, I wanted to like last night I had a doctor game and I was giving somebody and I was actually playing pretty, pretty mean.

35:42.240 --> 35:47.840
But I decided that I wanted this one Jill to live and I don't know, just I had this feeling that I wanted this Jill to live.

35:47.840 --> 35:50.560
And then I wanted to, you know, hook the bill because fuck Bill.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.840
You know how I feel about a bill.

35:54.320 --> 35:54.840
I do.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.760
Oh, Billiam, oh, Bill, he dies.

35:59.200 --> 36:05.960
Anyway, so at any rate, so the I don't think the Jill quite believed me.

36:05.960 --> 36:15.480
So I was like, I was doing the electric attack at the at the at the hatch because you can hear when that goes off.

36:15.480 --> 36:16.760
And I was like, it's right here, it's right here.

36:16.920 --> 36:23.560
And finally, I just went after her and gave her like the super notters and then headed in the direction of the thing.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.600
And she's like, oh, I get it.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.600
You're being nice.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.280
And she went down the hatch.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.080
So I love that.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.280
But then you get assholes.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.040
Yeah, I know.

36:31.040 --> 36:41.400
And the assholes have been out in force, like to the point where I'm just keeping a because, you know, now those new what is it?

36:41.400 --> 36:46.200
The the build saver things are up.

36:46.560 --> 36:54.480
And I have a I have a few that's permanently have light born on it so that no one can flashlight me and then I can laugh at them when I realize that they're doing the oh shit moment.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.440
I love that moment.

36:58.120 --> 37:01.880
And then, you know, go on about my game and it's been pretty fun.

37:02.880 --> 37:14.560
And, you know, I'm not the only one that's noticed that on both sides because, you know, a lot of my survivor main friends are like, oh, these these killers are being like extra sweaty and all of this.

37:14.560 --> 37:18.960
And I'm like, well, I mean, it is good for blood points.

37:18.960 --> 37:23.120
You know, if everyone brings like the flan, we no longer have cake this year, we have flan.

37:24.080 --> 37:24.880
Flantastic.

37:25.400 --> 37:26.320
It's flantastic.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.080
Yes, a flaniversary.

37:29.280 --> 37:37.960
But at any rate, it's it's been a really weird mix and people are also playing weird.

37:37.960 --> 37:38.960
Have you noticed that?

37:39.560 --> 37:40.560
A little bit.

37:40.760 --> 37:43.360
They're not farming like they did during the last event.

37:43.360 --> 37:43.800
It's weird.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.680
Anyway, not everyone plays dead by daylight.

37:45.680 --> 37:52.680
So but can I say one quick thing, though, because this about all games in general, not just dead by daylight, but you talked about it.

37:52.680 --> 37:57.440
You talked about the tier list and how you play pig, even though she's not considered S tier.

37:57.440 --> 38:00.480
And I think you already know what you're saying to you.

38:00.480 --> 38:01.200
She's S tier.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.520
But that's the point.

38:02.520 --> 38:07.760
That's actually the point is that tier list for any game, Smash Brothers, whatever it is that you're into.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.080
Tier lists are bullshit.

38:10.240 --> 38:16.560
I'm here to say tier lists are bullshit and they're clickbait and they're there to start an argument.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.200
That's all it is.

38:17.200 --> 38:20.800
And I don't even care if it's based off statistics.

38:20.800 --> 38:21.360
That's right.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.600
I'm telling you, I don't care about math.

38:23.600 --> 38:28.520
I don't care about facts because video games are supposed to be fun.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.480
So the tier list, what?

38:31.480 --> 38:36.840
The tier list can be super fun, especially if you make one on stream and you make it like completely ridiculous.

38:36.840 --> 38:40.160
If you know that it's ridiculous and not serious.

38:40.160 --> 38:46.960
And so when I say like, you know, oh, there's a definitive, you know, some dead by daylight streamer put out the definitive tier list of killers or whatever.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.360
Otz Darva puts out those lists.

38:50.360 --> 39:00.680
And then when I started playing, I looked at the tier list that existed at that point that Otz made.

39:00.760 --> 39:01.120
Yeah.

39:01.880 --> 39:08.640
And I was like, okay, I kind of get, you know, reading over, you know, get these perks for these killers, play them in this order.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.560
It's a good idea.

39:10.080 --> 39:13.720
And then I realized after, you know, I started with plague.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.640
I mean, you remember I started with as a plague main.

39:16.400 --> 39:23.800
And then I was like, fuck this, Legion's more fun, even though Legion is considered, you know, at the time, not very great.

39:24.080 --> 39:28.000
Yeah, it's all about what makes the game fun for you.

39:28.000 --> 39:34.400
And for me, I think she's like mid tier on the technical ones or whatever, but I love playing Sadako as the killer.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.240
Like she's a lot of fun to me.

39:36.240 --> 39:39.200
I love, I really love dredge though, porting around the map.

39:39.400 --> 39:44.040
See, and I can't get into dredge the same way I get into Sadako, even though they both have the teleportation mechanic.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.880
But Sadako has these add ons that make it really fun.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.520
And like, I just really like playing her.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.800
So I thought it was fun.

39:49.800 --> 39:50.400
Don't get me wrong.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.240
I love Sadako.

39:51.560 --> 39:57.560
On top of that, she's really short and shorter killers are easier for me to not get motion sick with.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.040
Yeah, and it's but that's again, it's taste.

40:00.040 --> 40:02.400
So taste greater than tier list.

40:02.560 --> 40:09.440
Anyway, I also do like freaking people out with dredge because if you get it just the right moment, you'll scare the shit out of somebody.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.840
You can get some good jump scares on him.

40:10.840 --> 40:11.340
Yeah.

40:11.640 --> 40:19.320
Oh, especially I use this add on where every time he goes through a locker, he exits a locker, all the lockers bang their doors.

40:19.480 --> 40:20.720
Oh, that's awful.

40:20.760 --> 40:21.760
It's one of his eries.

40:22.160 --> 40:22.720
Oh, wow.

40:23.040 --> 40:23.360
All right.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.000
Yeah.

40:24.280 --> 40:25.880
Okay, so back to my other games.

40:25.920 --> 40:26.440
Yes.

40:26.520 --> 40:30.680
So yeah, it was Terranigma, it was Dead by Daylight, it was wordscapes.

40:30.680 --> 40:38.920
But another one I'm going to count because I think that my decisions have helped other people play it or my suggestions is the quarry.

40:40.520 --> 40:46.760
So many fucking people are playing the quarry that I feel like I have played it too.

40:47.720 --> 40:50.120
Because like, I've gotten into it and like,

40:50.120 --> 40:52.120
it's kind of meant to be played like that, though.

40:52.120 --> 40:56.800
Like it's, it's a couch co-op game that works really well on Twitch, in a way.

40:57.480 --> 41:02.200
Except for, of course, all the QuickTime events, because the person playing it really does need to be on their game.

41:02.240 --> 41:02.720
Yeah.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.160
Like, especially the ones where you have to shoot things.

41:05.480 --> 41:16.000
Oh, but anyway, the the fun thing for me, I mean, and some of the some of the people that have stayed for like long playthroughs have have taken my suggestions.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.560
They liked my logic behind it.

41:17.960 --> 41:21.920
And so we've had a really, really good time.

41:22.360 --> 41:28.600
And I've, I've really kind of gotten into the lore of it now.

41:28.600 --> 41:35.040
I'm at the problem right now where I think it will run a Windows 11 ARM because it's an x64 game.

41:36.000 --> 41:48.720
But I'm afraid that the the cheat anti cheat on it won't run like I'm having that same problem with VHS and Dead by Daylight through Steam.

41:48.720 --> 41:59.400
So I'm, that's why I haven't bought it, but I've watched like playthroughs and everything and the cast in this game is absolutely amazing.

41:59.720 --> 42:02.560
Like, I'm just gonna say Ted Raimi's in it and leave it at that.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.080
Mic drop.

42:04.200 --> 42:08.080
Grace Zebrowski, Laura Palmer's mom is in it.

42:08.080 --> 42:14.480
And like I told Shane, I'm like, if you led with that, I would have bought this game day one, because he's been trying to get me to play it.

42:15.080 --> 42:16.640
Halston Sage is in it.

42:16.640 --> 42:21.040
She she had her the the Dazzler cameo in X-Men Dark Phoenix.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.200
The kid from Detective Pikachu, isn't it?

42:24.240 --> 42:27.360
Yeah, he played he plays Ryan, the one that people either hate or love.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.080
Yeah, yeah.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.000
But also Lin Shaye is in it.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.840
She was the the elderly woman in the grudge at the beginning of the movie.

42:37.280 --> 42:40.920
And she was the psychic in the insidious movies.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.120
David Arquette.

42:44.800 --> 42:45.320
Mm hmm.

42:46.040 --> 42:52.520
Yeah, and like Bobby said this, the other thing I didn't mention is that Halston Sage was also in Orville.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.920
But I mean, we've got some like, really good.

42:59.200 --> 43:01.520
Really, really good people in it.

43:01.520 --> 43:12.200
And I'm actually going to try to confirm something real quick because Mark Silverman plays the near yep, Mark Silverman is the biggest person.

43:13.200 --> 43:17.480
The biggest voice mimic for Rod Serling.

43:20.280 --> 43:30.280
And when I was listening to the tutorial parts of it, I was like, holy shit, that totally sounds like like, like, you know, Rod Serling.

43:30.280 --> 43:36.040
And I was like, I bet it's that guy who does his voice in all of the things like for Tower of Terror.

43:36.040 --> 43:37.520
So it was him.

43:38.520 --> 43:39.480
It was absolutely him.

43:39.480 --> 43:40.160
How funny.

43:41.040 --> 43:42.520
And I absolutely love that.

43:42.520 --> 43:44.920
They've got like and Brenda Song.

43:45.520 --> 43:46.040
Oh, yeah.

43:46.040 --> 43:46.520
Hello.

43:46.520 --> 43:47.040
Yeah.

43:47.480 --> 44:01.080
But like, it's funny, though, how many of these people were in, like, were Disney actors, and then went on to be like in various scary movies.

44:01.080 --> 44:11.560
Like we had the guy that played Dylan was in Halloween in the twenty eighteen Halloween, the guy who played Nick as in Star Trek, Picard, we have a lot of oh, and Lance Henriksen is in it.

44:11.560 --> 44:12.560
I mean, oh, wow.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.200
Can you can you get much cooler?

44:14.200 --> 44:19.440
But that's I mean, it just goes to show like how well Until Dawn did that the studio now has.

44:19.440 --> 44:26.920
I mean, you know, Until Dawn had what's her name from Heroes, who plays Kirby and scream Hayden Penta near.

44:26.920 --> 44:31.320
I don't know if I'm right, but that was like the biggest name that was in that Until Dawn.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.520
And now they're getting a lot.

44:32.520 --> 44:44.680
I mean, just because either the budget got bigger or the game, you know, because y'all might remember or not, Until Dawn exceeded expectations big time because they really did not market that game.

44:44.680 --> 44:53.280
And I don't know if it's because of streaming or what the strong word of mouth, but that game did very, very well where it was all of a sudden like, whoa, there needs to be a franchise here.

44:53.280 --> 44:54.840
And so there was the Medal of Adan.

44:54.840 --> 45:00.360
But this is like the first true like follow up that is very, very similar to Until Dawn.

45:00.360 --> 45:08.400
The one thing is that all these articles that have Ted Raimi listed, they mention Evil Dead, they mention Spider-Man, but they forget his most important role.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.400
Jock, sir.

45:09.400 --> 45:10.400
Hello.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.400
Oh, right.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.400
Right.

45:13.400 --> 45:22.400
So at any rate, though, there's another little bit of interesting trivia about this, and that is that the game is a little bit different from the original game, but it's a little bit different from the original game.

45:22.520 --> 45:46.520
And I would say that the game was, well, I don't know if it's a rumor or if it was based on different, the fact that Google had a partnership with Supermassive, the publisher, or sorry, the developer, but apparently the quarry was supposed to be on Stadia.

45:46.640 --> 45:52.640
Because of those developments that happen with the in-house production for different things that fell through the cracks.

45:52.640 --> 46:00.640
There's also supposed to be the game High on Life was supposed to, they were, both of them were associated.

46:00.640 --> 46:08.640
They were associated by partnership, but never officially associated with Stadia.

46:08.760 --> 46:20.760
Supermassive was looking for a publishing partner when the project came to completion, but it ended up, it didn't get released on it.

46:20.760 --> 46:28.760
Now, if it had been released on Stadia, I would have paid full fucking price for this and any DLC or whatever would have happened.

46:28.760 --> 46:30.760
This would have been mine.

46:30.880 --> 46:37.880
They've reached out for comment on it, but, you know, no one's really said anything.

46:37.880 --> 46:44.880
And I mean, it's not like Stadia hasn't had some really big games. I mean, they got Resident Evil Village, you know.

46:44.880 --> 46:45.880
Right.

46:45.880 --> 46:49.880
They have Elder Scrolls Online, they got Mortal Kombat 11.

46:49.880 --> 46:53.880
I'm still getting some pretty big titles on there. It's far from dead.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
So I can be hopeful.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
Although, I'm going to go ahead and just say this now since I mentioned Capcom.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
A Resident Evil Village is coming to Mack and fall.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Oh, cool.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Yep.

47:10.000 --> 47:23.000
Apparently the new Metal and the M2 chip when it comes out is more than capable of actually playing games better than a lot of modern graphics cards.

47:23.120 --> 47:25.120
And a lot of modern PCs.

47:25.120 --> 47:29.120
So I might have to upgrade.

47:29.120 --> 47:30.120
All right.

47:30.120 --> 47:32.120
Well, that's it for your gaming week.

47:32.120 --> 47:35.120
Let's go over to Loki and talk about your gaming week, Loki.

47:35.120 --> 47:42.120
It's been very busy with Minecraft still, but I just started Channel 64 season two.

47:42.120 --> 47:48.120
So we all kicked that off last night and last afternoon, I guess.

47:48.120 --> 47:50.120
But it's been all day.

47:50.240 --> 47:54.240
So very excited to get started making content on there.

47:54.240 --> 47:57.240
And then this week's going to be busy with making content as well.

47:57.240 --> 48:01.240
I took the week off from work to focus on content stuff.

48:01.240 --> 48:04.240
So I'm going to see what I can come up with.

48:04.240 --> 48:05.240
I've already done a lot.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.240
So I got to go through a ton of footage.

48:07.240 --> 48:10.240
Early game is always very hard to make content around.

48:10.240 --> 48:15.240
At least structured content because it's kind of all over the place and you don't know what's going to happen.

48:15.240 --> 48:19.240
So it takes a long time to edit, unfortunately.

48:19.360 --> 48:22.360
But I'm confident that I'll be able to put some stuff out.

48:22.360 --> 48:25.360
And I got to do some more of my hardcore series as well.

48:25.360 --> 48:28.360
So yeah, lots of stuff coming out.

48:28.360 --> 48:29.360
All right.

48:29.360 --> 48:32.360
Well, best of luck with those videos and all that.

48:32.360 --> 48:35.360
So looking forward to seeing the Minecraft content you put out.

48:35.360 --> 48:38.360
And I know things have been getting bigger for you over on YouTube a little bit.

48:38.360 --> 48:39.360
So congrats.

48:39.360 --> 48:40.360
Yeah, a little bit.

48:40.360 --> 48:42.360
We're like 460 now, I think.

48:42.360 --> 48:43.360
Nice.

48:43.360 --> 48:44.360
Almost 500.

48:44.360 --> 48:45.360
That's great.

48:45.360 --> 48:48.360
Maybe you'll cross 500 in the next week or so, right around the time OLR hits 20.

48:48.480 --> 48:49.480
That's awesome.

48:49.480 --> 48:50.480
Maybe.

48:50.480 --> 48:51.480
Maybe.

48:51.480 --> 48:52.480
Cool.

48:52.480 --> 48:53.480
All right.

48:53.480 --> 48:54.480
Let's see.

48:54.480 --> 48:55.480
Moving on.

48:55.480 --> 48:56.480
My gaming week.

48:56.480 --> 48:58.480
So honestly, most of my week was taken up with a computer transition and just trying

48:58.480 --> 49:02.480
to make sure everything would work for tonight and trying to get everything back up and running.

49:02.480 --> 49:04.480
I didn't move my drives over.

49:04.480 --> 49:08.480
I still have the old computer pretty much put together and I can pull files from it

49:08.480 --> 49:09.480
as needed.

49:09.480 --> 49:12.480
But for the most part, I just decided to kind of use this as like a fresh start.

49:12.480 --> 49:15.480
I didn't want to run the same Windows install or try to do that or anything.

49:15.480 --> 49:17.480
So I was just like, you know what, let's just start fresh.

49:17.600 --> 49:21.600
And I'll copy over the stuff I need and still have those drives, you know, available if

49:21.600 --> 49:25.600
I ever need to pull media off of them like pictures or something like that.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.600
So yeah, spending most of my time setting it up.

49:28.600 --> 49:33.600
However, you know, of course, I had to bring up Final Fantasy 14 and see how that would

49:33.600 --> 49:34.600
run.

49:34.600 --> 49:36.600
And it's so smooth.

49:36.600 --> 49:41.600
It's like I'm not really playing at a better resolution or anything because I was playing

49:41.600 --> 49:45.600
in 4K before, but I definitely noticed the frame rate improvement.

49:45.720 --> 49:50.440
And now I'm excited that when I stream, I can actually use the 4K and have it.

49:50.440 --> 49:52.440
I can't stream it in 4K.

49:52.440 --> 49:57.240
Well, if Twitch allowed me to, I probably do have the computer powerful enough to stream

49:57.240 --> 50:00.240
in 4K and I don't have limited bandwidth.

50:00.240 --> 50:05.240
So if I was Twitch partner, I probably could stream it at 4K.

50:05.240 --> 50:10.320
However, I'm not, I can always do a YouTube maybe, but I'm not really in a hurry to do

50:10.320 --> 50:11.320
that.

50:11.480 --> 50:15.800
But what I can do is play the game in the full window as opposed to having to size it

50:15.800 --> 50:20.280
down just so I can stream it and not have my computer stutter all over the place.

50:20.280 --> 50:21.280
So that'd be really nice.

50:21.280 --> 50:23.260
I'm looking forward to that for like streaming.

50:23.260 --> 50:28.580
So I played a little bit of that this week with Final Fantasy 14, didn't really make

50:28.580 --> 50:29.760
any meaningful progress.

50:29.760 --> 50:33.320
My paladin is 85, woohoo.

50:33.320 --> 50:36.980
And then I also played a little bit of Dead by Daylight, just a little, but I wanted to

50:36.980 --> 50:39.600
see how that would look on the new computer.

50:39.600 --> 50:42.200
And that one, I mean, Dead by Daylight is a six year old game.

50:42.200 --> 50:43.720
We're literally in the six year anniversary event.

50:43.720 --> 50:48.040
So it's not like you have this massive 4K mode or anything, but it's nice enough.

50:48.040 --> 50:50.880
I definitely noticed again, it's the smoothness.

50:50.880 --> 50:54.680
It's a nice enough, and it is, I think a tactical advantage too.

50:54.680 --> 50:58.900
I can see things in the background so much better now.

50:58.900 --> 51:02.700
And so I can be more aware of things like I can see killers from further away and stuff

51:02.700 --> 51:05.420
or make them out better than I could before.

51:05.420 --> 51:09.040
So that part is kind of nice in the few games that I played.

51:09.480 --> 51:11.600
That's what it's like for me on Stadia.

51:11.600 --> 51:14.720
Oh yeah, cause Stadia is already doing the high graphics level processing.

51:14.720 --> 51:15.720
Yeah.

51:15.720 --> 51:16.720
So that's, that's nice.

51:16.720 --> 51:17.720
Yeah.

51:17.720 --> 51:22.280
So, yeah, there were definitely like, obviously the new Ninja Turtles game is very much on

51:22.280 --> 51:23.280
my radar.

51:23.280 --> 51:27.280
Like I'm hearing a lot of positive feedback about that cause that's very much geared at

51:27.280 --> 51:32.560
our generation that played that in the pizza parlor, the old Turtles beat them up game.

51:32.560 --> 51:36.860
And I have, I see a lot of people going, I wish they do this for the Simpsons.

51:36.860 --> 51:38.400
And I think that's a great idea.

51:38.400 --> 51:40.160
And what else, am I correct?

51:40.160 --> 51:44.840
I believe the studio that made that Shredder's Revenge, I could be wrong, but I thought I

51:44.840 --> 51:49.820
heard it's the same studio that did the Dragon Trap remake a couple of years ago.

51:49.820 --> 51:55.980
And that was an excellent retro remake that, I mean, like that was like really one of them

51:55.980 --> 51:57.320
done really well.

51:57.320 --> 51:58.320
Okay.

51:58.320 --> 51:59.320
Darktosuya says it's them.

51:59.320 --> 52:00.320
Yeah.

52:00.320 --> 52:05.720
I can see why this one is getting such positive critiques and the fact that they nailed it

52:05.720 --> 52:09.900
because like that dragons, dragon or Wonder Boy, you know what I mean?

52:09.900 --> 52:16.000
That game was a very, very good re re-imagining or whatever you want to call it.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.160
Something else came out recently too that I wanted to play as well, but I just, you

52:19.160 --> 52:24.320
know, I'll have to do it in this next week, but I really, really am hoping I can stream

52:24.320 --> 52:28.680
more now because I can stream based off my PC and don't have to rely on the Xbox for

52:28.680 --> 52:30.520
everything that's not Final Fantasy.

52:30.520 --> 52:35.400
So and the nice thing is the Turtles game, Tunic and all these other games I've been

52:35.400 --> 52:39.840
playing, they're on PC as well, so I can just go hog on Game Pass and stream it from

52:39.840 --> 52:40.840
the PCs.

52:40.840 --> 52:41.840
That'd be nice.

52:41.840 --> 52:46.280
So S2100Matt says I'm still running Windows 7 on one machine here.

52:46.280 --> 52:52.880
Well, can I point out, Matt, what a long way we've come from the studio that we were in

52:52.880 --> 52:57.960
pre-pandemic at my old house where you might recall right before the pandemic happened

52:57.960 --> 53:03.000
and we took the show virtual, you might remember I was running a machine that still had Windows

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
XP.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.280
I almost said Windows 95, but it was Windows XP.

53:07.280 --> 53:08.720
We're still running on that machine.

53:08.720 --> 53:15.080
So and now my how far we've come in that short amount of time, relatively, I've gone from

53:15.080 --> 53:17.980
an XP machine to 10 to now 11.

53:17.980 --> 53:20.920
Now I'm ahead of a lot of people.

53:20.920 --> 53:23.400
So yeah, tonight's show is on 11 now.

53:23.400 --> 53:25.720
So yeah, Tiger Class says it's the new computer running on 11.

53:25.720 --> 53:26.720
Yes it is.

53:26.720 --> 53:31.880
And the start menu changes are really taking me some getting used to, but otherwise it's

53:31.880 --> 53:32.880
fine.

53:33.680 --> 53:38.460
Most of it hasn't changed from 10, at least as far as the user experience goes.

53:38.460 --> 53:43.600
And that's a good thing in my opinion, like the taskbar stuff enough is a weird enough

53:43.600 --> 53:45.680
change is taking me some getting used to.

53:45.680 --> 53:50.920
But Jamie, I know you're an Apple device user and you would appreciate the insight that

53:50.920 --> 53:53.360
my husband made on this whole thing.

53:53.360 --> 53:57.400
After the first time he used Windows 11 and he said, you know, every new version of Windows,

53:57.400 --> 53:59.880
they're just making it more and more like Mac OS.

53:59.880 --> 54:05.640
I figured you'd appreciate that comment.

54:05.640 --> 54:06.640
All right.

54:06.640 --> 54:09.400
Um, Dr. C says it's not like eight.

54:09.400 --> 54:10.400
Is it?

54:10.400 --> 54:11.400
Oh no, it's nothing like eight.

54:11.400 --> 54:12.400
They eight.

54:12.400 --> 54:15.000
The reason why eight flopped is that eight was tried.

54:15.000 --> 54:20.220
They tried to bring the tablet experience to a desktop didn't work.

54:20.220 --> 54:22.520
So no, it's, it's not like eight at all.

54:22.520 --> 54:24.120
So but 11 is fine.

54:24.120 --> 54:26.200
Tiger class says you can change it to look more like 10.

54:26.200 --> 54:27.200
Oh shit.

54:27.200 --> 54:28.200
Maybe I need to do that.

54:28.200 --> 54:35.560
The look of 11, but it's, I can, it's either or so anyway, let's move on.

54:35.560 --> 54:39.800
Let's talk about some more news and, uh, we'd actually don't have a lot of headlines tonight.

54:39.800 --> 54:40.800
I have to be honest.

54:40.800 --> 54:42.800
We're about half the usual headlines.

54:42.800 --> 54:46.800
So it could end up being a shorter show, but we talked about morbid shit for an hour.

54:46.800 --> 54:48.360
So I don't know.

54:48.360 --> 54:51.040
What do you expect here to LR, but we'll get into our first story.

54:51.040 --> 54:54.160
I should say though, sorry, Logie.

54:54.160 --> 55:02.200
I should officially say 20 comma O L R next week, the 20th anniversary of orange launch

55:02.200 --> 55:03.200
radio.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.500
This show started June 23rd, 2002.

55:05.500 --> 55:06.500
It scrolls along the bottom.

55:06.500 --> 55:08.160
You've probably seen it.

55:08.160 --> 55:13.000
So we're celebrating 20 years on the air next week.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.840
I don't have confetti cannons.

55:15.840 --> 55:17.420
There is a cute little announcement.

55:17.420 --> 55:21.960
There is a fan project that's been worked on and I'm going to tell you more about that

55:21.960 --> 55:22.960
next week.

55:23.400 --> 55:26.320
Uh, that's one little, so an announcement of an announcement.

55:26.320 --> 55:27.640
Yes, I just did that.

55:27.640 --> 55:30.720
So there will be a little something cute to look forward to otherwise.

55:30.720 --> 55:31.720
You know what?

55:31.720 --> 55:35.640
I'm just hoping we hear from some people we haven't heard from in a long time.

55:35.640 --> 55:37.880
That's always the fun about hitting a big anniversary show.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.620
I would love to hear from some people we haven't heard from from a long time.

55:40.620 --> 55:41.620
Don't forget.

55:41.620 --> 55:42.620
We have an email bag.

55:42.620 --> 55:43.620
Participate at orange launch radio.com.

55:43.620 --> 55:44.620
Twitter.

55:44.620 --> 55:46.720
You need to get some cake at O L R.

55:46.720 --> 55:47.720
I would love some cake.

55:47.720 --> 55:50.240
Are you going to bring me some cake?

55:50.240 --> 55:52.880
You can come over and have cake.

55:52.880 --> 55:55.880
All right.

55:55.880 --> 55:57.120
Now we can get him to some news.

55:57.120 --> 55:59.040
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

55:59.040 --> 56:00.920
Got some great news.

56:00.920 --> 56:07.120
Activision has investigated themselves and they found no evidence that they've ignored

56:07.120 --> 56:08.400
harassment.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.520
And you know what?

56:09.520 --> 56:11.400
I think I can trust them.

56:11.400 --> 56:16.520
Activision, the company that's totally trustworthy to investigate themselves.

56:16.520 --> 56:21.240
Because if you were guilty, I mean, you would totally be honest about all the guilty things

56:21.240 --> 56:22.240
that you did.

56:22.240 --> 56:25.200
You wouldn't just like say, oh, we didn't do that.

56:25.200 --> 56:29.360
Oh, I didn't see all that evidence over there.

56:29.360 --> 56:31.640
So case closed.

56:31.640 --> 56:36.760
I mean, I guess the gaming industry is great now.

56:36.760 --> 56:37.760
Harassment's dead.

56:37.760 --> 56:39.400
We've solved it.

56:39.400 --> 56:42.400
Activision's done it.

56:42.400 --> 56:46.080
Oh, no.

56:46.080 --> 56:51.600
So we were so close this time.

56:51.600 --> 56:56.560
Mike Defton Chat says, I trust ABK with that investigation as much as I trust Riot with

56:56.560 --> 56:57.560
theirs.

56:57.560 --> 56:58.560
Facts.

56:58.560 --> 57:07.480
I mean, congratulations on your internal investigations showing nothing when your employees have told

57:07.480 --> 57:10.880
you there is something.

57:10.880 --> 57:12.800
What's the problem here?

57:12.800 --> 57:21.040
You've put together this whole, you know, show theatrics to try to prove your own employees

57:21.040 --> 57:24.040
wrong?

57:24.040 --> 57:27.380
They're just proving how well they've ignored the problem.

57:27.380 --> 57:33.160
So they've ignored it so well that they can't see the problem anymore.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.920
I hope and I don't think it will.

57:34.920 --> 57:37.120
I mean, here's reality.

57:37.120 --> 57:40.000
Activision may have cleared itself of an internal investigation.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.640
Let us not forget how this whole thing started.

57:44.640 --> 57:49.900
State of California is doing its own investigation into what's going on.

57:49.900 --> 57:56.600
So there's still an external investigation pending, and that's the one that means something.

57:56.600 --> 58:02.360
And don't they think that publishing results like this is really poor form?

58:02.360 --> 58:03.360
Yeah.

58:03.360 --> 58:04.840
And I saw you just agree with this comment.

58:04.840 --> 58:07.880
I was about to read too, which hello to a VO by Kurt.

58:07.880 --> 58:08.880
Kurt, good to see you.

58:08.880 --> 58:14.720
Who says in chat, even if their investigations are real and whatnot, the optics alone are

58:14.720 --> 58:16.500
the worst PR.

58:16.500 --> 58:17.500
So short-sighted.

58:17.500 --> 58:25.880
Very that, very that is that why have this whole press release and trout out this, this

58:25.880 --> 58:30.800
should have been an internal PowerPoint.

58:30.800 --> 58:32.840
And that's it.

58:32.840 --> 58:39.520
It should not be a talking point or a bragging point or a dismissing your employees concerns

58:39.520 --> 58:46.080
point, which is what it's turning into.

58:46.080 --> 58:53.920
I think that's that chat comment is spot on is that it's terrible optics, even if they

58:53.920 --> 58:57.320
think they're doing nothing wrong.

58:57.320 --> 59:03.280
So we'll see what the external investigation, because if the external investigation finds

59:03.280 --> 59:08.520
stuff, which it already has for this to be in the news in the first place, the fact that

59:08.520 --> 59:12.800
the internal investigation shows nothing is just going to show that the internal investigation

59:12.800 --> 59:15.040
was full of garbage.

59:15.040 --> 59:18.920
And now Activision gets to own that.

59:18.920 --> 59:23.300
The only investigation that's going to matter is the external.

59:23.300 --> 59:24.300
Exactly that.

59:24.300 --> 59:26.800
So, all right.

59:26.800 --> 59:32.000
Let's move on and talk about, we talked earlier in the show about some announcements that

59:32.000 --> 59:38.800
came out of Square regarding Final Fantasy 7, but let's talk about the next story, which

59:38.800 --> 59:42.640
has to do with Capcom stuff.

59:42.640 --> 59:50.120
So Capcom did their own press event this week and sorry, I'm having problems on the technical

59:50.120 --> 59:53.800
end for whatever reason, the bar doesn't want to advance.

59:53.800 --> 59:54.800
Okay.

59:54.800 --> 59:55.800
That's weird.

59:55.800 --> 01:00:03.240
So talking about Capcom, they've had a little announcement of their own, of a few things,

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.680
including what Dark Sakura just addressed earlier is that Resident Evil is kind of expanding

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:14.300
and we have Resident Evil Village is coming to Stadia, but we also got some new versions,

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.300
if you will.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.300
It's already on Stadia.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.300
Oh, sorry.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:24.820
It's already launched on Stadia, but Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 are getting a minor update.

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:30.380
They're not new, they're basically like free upgrades, if you will, to be next gen compatible

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:34.700
for PlayStation 5, Xbox series, and PC and so forth.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:39.320
So that is a free next gen upgrade, then that came out.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.500
There will be a gold edition expansion for Resident Evil Village.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.140
So they are detailing some of that DLC.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:49.020
It will also contain a third person mode.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:53.560
So you can play the game like the old school Resident Evils, if that's more your style,

01:00:53.560 --> 01:01:00.320
I know Dark Sakura's talked before about how first person can be very, you know, sick

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320
inducing.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320
So...

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.880
Do we get the shirtless mods for Leon and Chris and all them?

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.880
Always on the internet, but never officially from Capcom.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.880
There will also be a story involving Rose and all this comes out just in time for Halloween

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.340
on October 28th of this year.

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.680
So that's pretty cool.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:27.700
They also, for whatever reason, they confirmed it after the fact, but they did confirm that

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:31.480
Dragon's Dogma 2 is a thing that's going to be happening.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:37.320
Although in the actual press event, they were like, we're celebrating the video, but whatever

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.480
they did confirm a Dragon's Dogma 2 is coming.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.560
That is a game that kind of has grown a lot of fans over the years.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.360
So folks will be very happy to hear that.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.800
And Monster Hunter Rise has its first, I think expansion, I think it's the first expansion,

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.080
Sunbreak is coming and there will be a demo for that that's coming out on June 14th.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:02.740
So lots of things going on in Capcom's world for them to have their own little video, which

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:08.120
is also interesting considering there was no E3 this year that Capcom kind of did this

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120
instead.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.080
Now, Capcom was the type of studio that would do their own press event in the past anyway,

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:16.680
but it's just interesting how it kind of played out this way when all was said and

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.560
done after all.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:26.960
So anyway, did anyone watch that and think anything about the Capcom announcements?

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.980
I watched some of it, but like I was kind of skimming through like a lot of it.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.760
I didn't notice the Dragon's Dogma thing.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.720
I wasn't, I didn't play the original, but like I was just trying to see if they had

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.720
new information.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.280
It's a lot of it seemed like it was kind of the same stuff, maybe a little bit more

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:51.640
expanded of what they already had shown during like the Xbox conference thing or even not

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:56.000
so much Xbox, but like during the Summer Games Fest stuff.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.080
So I was just, I don't know.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:02.120
Dark to see you in chat says I did like what I saw of Street Fighter 6.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.120
You know what?

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.120
Me too.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.120
And I'm just getting that vibe.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.120
I'm just getting that vibe that Street Fighter is going to be like Star Trek or like the

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.200
even numbered ones are the good ones.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.480
Not to slander Street Fighter 3 too hard, but let's be real, it wasn't 4 and it wasn't

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.480
2.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.080
Street Fighter 3 3rd Impact was fantastic.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.080
Oh yeah.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:23.160
By the time they finally refined it, yeah, it was, it was a lot better, but I don't know.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.000
It still didn't land with me the way 4 and 2 do.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.860
And then Street Fighter 5, like honestly is like a non-factor to me.

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:31.860
I just, I tried it.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:37.320
I played, they gave it away at one point, I was just kind of not into it, but I'm interested

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.320
in it.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.080
I was pissed off the Street Fighter 4 soundtrack was taken down out of Apple Music.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.720
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720
That's weird.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:48.640
Because it had like some of my favorite versions of the songs.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:54.360
Well you'll just have to turn to piracy or importing or whatever from Japan, I suppose

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.360
would be the answer.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.360
I should say.

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.040
We'll see how much I care about it.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.040
Yeah.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.040
All right.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.400
Let's move on to some more news.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.680
Dark Sakura with some unfortunate news.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.520
Well, we have a big womp womp for Halo Infinite.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:18.000
343 Industries had to issue an apology and a change in Halo Infinite for one of their

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.560
cosmetics that they released.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:26.340
Now today is Juneteenth, it's June 19th, which is the annual commemoration of the end of

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.880
slavery in the United States.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:38.920
So for Halo Infinite, they released an emblem with, you know, for some reason, it's not

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.280
showing it, but you know, nice colors and everything.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:49.440
But it was, the palette option was called Bonobo, which is a kind of ape.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:57.880
And whoever let that go, or whoever even named it that in the beginning, need to be fucking

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:06.520
fired, saying, but after it was pointed out, they updated the name to be Freedom and the

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.520
official statement.

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:13.100
And this comes from Bonnie Ross, the founder and head.

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:17.780
We were made aware of a palette option for our Juneteenth emblem that contained a term

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.700
that was offensive and hurtful.

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:22.840
The team immediately addressed this issue via an update.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.640
We are a studio and franchise that is committed to inclusivity where everyone is welcome and

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.760
supported to be their true selves.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:35.620
On behalf of 343, I apologize for making a celebrated moment a hurtful moment.

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:38.580
That actually, I like how that was phrased.

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:40.660
I'm glad she took accountability.

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:45.740
Like the situation sucks, but I think we all know, Bobby Kotick would have phrased this

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.180
a lot differently.

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:50.620
And I appreciate that she at least, she didn't try to pass the buck.

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.240
She didn't try to place blame.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.440
She said, I'm sorry.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.620
And we don't have enough CEOs to say that in this industry.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:03.760
There's also a statement from their community manor, John Junisic, I think is how it's pronounced.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.360
We strive to create a diverse and inclusive gaming communities while the original name

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.580
refers to an internal tool set.

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:15.280
It was not intended to be applied to this context and we recognize the harm it may have

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.280
caused.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.280
Yeah.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.740
I was gonna say, I thought I had heard somewhere that that name was a reference to an internal

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:23.980
tool set, but still, I mean, I'm not, I'm not excusing what happened because you still

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:30.900
have to wonder how did it go through all these steps to actually being released without

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:36.060
anyone catching that is a yikes.

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:42.860
It's not the first time though, that we've seen unfinished items be published or things

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:46.160
get published early or the wrong versions of things get published.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:52.300
You know, it, it happens, I mean, in the digital age, it can now be quickly and easily corrected,

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.980
but still, I, that's a pretty big one.

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.980
That's a pretty big one.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.740
A yikes to say the least.

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:01.740
Yeah.

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:07.300
Um, but I, I guess if there's anything to be hopeful about, again, at least you can

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:14.700
kind of look at, okay, when a shitty situation happens, how does a person react to that?

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.900
Do they, do they delete their Twitter account, India Farah?

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:25.080
Do they, do they do that or do they, um, take accountability and ownership and, you know,

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.080
and that whole thing.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.440
And, and at least she did that.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:34.980
So I'm again, not acute situation, not good, but let's be hopeful that when she says it,

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:39.760
it should never happen again, that there is a little bit of substance behind that.

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.760
We hope.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.760
Yeah.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:46.820
So, all right, well, moving on Loki.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.460
All right.

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:52.660
Something the internet and the people of, uh, the gamers won't be accountable for is

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.700
this, but we'll, we'll talk about this.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:08:00.060
Well, people are not happy with Diablo immortal, um, especially after seeing Diablo four and

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:07.620
how great that looks, um, basically, you know, bombing it on Metacritic as what they do.

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:13.660
And so now it is the lowest rated user score or has the lowest rated user score of all

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:21.380
time because you know, of their horrible monetization practices with it, it's just

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:22.380
very pay to win.

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:29.460
So not surprised as what happens, but did you, did you hear the followup from yesterday

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:35.420
or today about not, not about Metacritic, but about how well Diablo mortal's doing.

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.420
Yeah.

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:37.420
Yeah.

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:43.260
That in the first two weeks they've made, was it $24 million?

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:46.140
They've made $24 million in two weeks.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.140
Great.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:49.820
And this is why the behavior is never going to change.

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:51.740
Great job holding that.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:56.380
Great job dragging this whole thing through the mud, talk and doing these greatest on

01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:57.380
scores.

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:00.540
Here is a fucking wake up call.

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:05.980
Those scores on Metacritic do not mean shit.

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:12.780
You are wasting your fucking time writing them.

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:17.860
That $24 million this game just earned, that's what matters.

01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:22.740
You fucked up because, and I, you know what, maybe I have to take accountability cause

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.420
I did say I downloaded the game.

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:25.780
I tried it out.

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:31.980
I didn't give them any money, but you know, fine.

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:36.540
I played into the $8 million figure, but I told you it's complicated for a lot of us

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:41.260
because I do know people that worked on that game and deserve to have success even if their

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:44.780
managers and higher ups don't.

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:50.340
So it's tricky, but I'm just saying this whole Metacritic thing, and this is my point.

01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:53.620
It doesn't mean shit when this is happening.

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.580
Like it's, it's a wasted effort.

01:09:55.580 --> 01:10:02.700
Your Metacritic, your change.orgs will do nothing.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.500
You know what you need to do?

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:10.820
Stop watching the streamers that are spending $15,000 to tell you something you already

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:11.860
know.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:17.180
And all of these other, and you've got to wonder where's this $24 million come from?

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:21.740
How many streamers have we heard of that are dumping thousands of dollars into this game?

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:26.940
I'm not going to tell you how to spend your money, but where do you think the streamers

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:36.260
got that money to do that from you watching them and doing your biddies and your subs?

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:41.780
They learned it from you in turn enabled this $24 million.

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:48.740
So if you are out there writing these Metacritic reviews and you're watching these streamers

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:53.260
at the same time and giving them money so that they in turn can go pay it in Diablo

01:10:53.260 --> 01:11:01.780
Immortal, you are fucking up.

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:04.460
Rob Roberts, your friend, here to tell it to you like it is.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:07.100
Sorry, it's not always cute.

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:14.180
teacher Rob Estin Chat says, ah shit, uncle Rob taking them to school.

01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:15.180
You know what?

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:20.460
Sometimes, sometimes you just have to break it down for a bitch.

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:25.300
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I saw a video from James Stephanie Sterling on the Diablo Immortal

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:26.300
fuckery.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.300
Apparently it costs somewhere in the $100,000 range to max your character.

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:37.580
Yeah, there was a headline going around about that and, but here's, can I, in, in defense

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:43.780
of the frontline workers who worked hard on Diablo Immortal, who maybe had nothing to

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:47.160
do with this whole pay to win scheme.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:55.020
Is that, do you have to have the best of the best equipment to enjoy the game?

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.580
Because I've played, I mean, I haven't installed it on the new computers.

01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:02.140
I haven't really touched it this week, but like I played a good five, six hours without

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:06.740
dropping a dime on the game and I relatively enjoyed myself.

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:11.020
I heard once you get to the end game, you're really, really pressured to spend more money.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.020
I might.

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:16.340
No, I probably won't actually like if I've gone this long without, yeah, I probably not

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:17.340
going to do it.

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.340
I'm not going to.

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.220
And especially, you know, hearing these stories about how much it takes, I'm not going to

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.300
do it.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:27.160
Like how hard is it to just not give it money?

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.340
And before I understand, there's this whole thing on social media about it's enabling

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:34.460
gambling addiction and it's enabling all this.

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.460
Okay.

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:40.720
At some point you have to take personal accountability for that type of shit.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:47.000
And if that is a trap for you, then you have to not walk in that, that could be many games

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.600
out there, not just Diablo Immortal.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.800
Many games are doing this exact same thing.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:57.700
So I sort of find that argument to be a little bit, but I just, there, there is a way to

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:03.160
enjoy this game and play the game and not spend money.

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.440
And DJ Ramesh says, if you need to spend money to beef up your character to beat the game,

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.440
is it really worth playing?

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.440
I would say no.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.280
And that's the point where I would stop.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.280
Yeah.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.160
Bonstablo 6 says, I cannot wrap my head around paying and paying and paying to play a game

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.440
or games in general.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:26.440
You know, I pay a monthly fee to play Final Fantasy 14 online and I don't regret it whatsoever.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:30.540
I pay money to dress up the survivors I don't play in Dead by Daylight.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:34.060
So on one hand, you have to spend money on the stuff that makes you happy.

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:40.420
I feel that what I'm paying is justified because I know what I'm getting.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:43.460
And that's a big difference from this Diablo Immortal situation.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:47.780
And even when Jamie's talking about playing dress up, she knows what she's getting.

01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:52.240
And these games, both Dead by Daylight and Final Fantasy, they continue to support with

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.900
regular updates and so forth that I feel like I'm paying into.

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.420
I think it's, you know, it's, it's that whole thing.

01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.420
Yeah.

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.180
DJ Ramesh says, I'll pay to remove the ads from the game.

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.760
Def says, I'll pay the Pokemon Unite Battle Pass.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.840
No one is here to tell you how you should spend your money.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:14.420
But if it costs, I mean, if the odds in Diablo are that shitty to get these items, you kind

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.380
of have to just say no at some point.

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.920
You really do.

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:22.120
And Prince Brightstar in chat says, or the government just outright bans it.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.440
There are certain countries where people can't play it.

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:32.060
And honestly, I think I'm surprised that Blizzard is not required to publish the odds.

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:37.940
And I think it's just a matter of time before this game gets in front of the lawmakers that

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:38.940
need to see it.

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:41.740
And we're going to see that become a law, at least in some states.

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:45.380
The government is slow, but it's going to happen.

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.380
Mark my word.

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:50.940
This game, this game, Diablo Immortal, is going to cause states to pass laws where the

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:55.380
odds have to be transparent.

01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:58.140
The government doesn't do a lot, but it'll do that.

01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.780
All right.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:03.980
As Joe and Hunter Matt wants to point out, also keep in mind that some streamers are

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:08.840
also paid by the devs with in-game currency to spend to make these loot box videos.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.380
The logic behind it is that if a streamer inspires a viewer to possibly buy into the

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:16.780
game and its loot boxes, they see it as solid advertising.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.820
EA does this with ultimate team streamers.

01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:23.220
It's all that influencer presence.

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:28.460
Because it's also, and this is important, it's also not unique to gaming.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:36.380
For example, I have a friend who is a drag influencer, and this person got sent a makeup

01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:42.100
kit from a makeup company to do an unboxing video on Instagram and show off all the makeup

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:44.420
to their Instagram followers.

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:50.440
It is the exact same thing, but with makeup.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:59.720
I get mobile game invites for betas.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:05.120
So I just all want you to remember, your Diablo Immortal $15,000 spending streams is just

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.120
makeup.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.120
Remember.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.080
Hey, makeup's great.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.760
Like you know what?

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.760
You know, I'm not-

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.760
Mine is.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.760
Yes, your makeup is great.

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:21.360
I know there's been a lot, I think in 2022 we've come a long way with some of these stereotypes,

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.280
but even for guys, you know what?

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.880
A little foundation will cover up a lot of stuff.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.920
Nail polish, kind of cool.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.720
Like a lot of rock stars use it.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.060
It's not what it used to be, so anyway.

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:35.920
The guy liner must return.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.920
I know, right?

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.480
I kind of miss guy liner.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.440
Quest Buster says, I had to dig to find the odds on drops in Diablo Immortal and found

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.640
out about its version of a pity system.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.640
In comparison, a gotcha like Genshin Impact literally provides the odds up front for their

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.640
banners.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:50.640
Yep.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.640
Yep.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.640
All right, let's move on.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:58.920
Let's talk about a game instead that, you know, isn't going to be a nickel and dime

01:16:58.920 --> 01:16:59.920
thing.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:00.920
At least I don't think it is.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.180
I'd be very depressed if it was.

01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:06.240
This is actually a game called Atari Vault, or I'm sorry, excuse me, Atari Mania.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.040
Atari Vault was a former collection.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.960
Atari Mania is a collection that was just announced.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:19.160
It's 150 micro games that are incorporating the 1970s and 80s classic Atari games.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:25.560
It's going to be coming out on Switch, PC via Steam, and the Atari VCS, remember that?

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.960
Finally, it has a game that, you know, but okay.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.800
But it's coming out on Steam and Switch, and let's be real, that's where most of you are

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.520
going to check it out.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:36.600
And it's waiting for them to celebrate Atari's 50th anniversary.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.880
Now here's the thing, I gotta say, in actually looking at the game a little bit, and let

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:45.520
me see if I can pull this up, at least for the Twitch viewers here.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:50.920
Let me do a quick little presto change-o on my new setup here to show you what this

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:51.920
looks like.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.300
I'm sorry, this is a great technical breakthrough.

01:17:55.300 --> 01:18:01.720
Your boxes don't go gray anymore when I switch because you're on the Discord app, I'm sorry.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.200
I know none of you know what I'm talking about, but I just had a very exciting technical breakthrough

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.200
on this side.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:11.160
Anyway, but my point is, here we go, on the other screen, this is what the Atari Classics

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.640
look like now in this game.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:17.020
So they've, even though we're talking, like that was Yars' Revenge, hold on, let me go

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.120
back in the video there.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.960
That was very clearly, that here, see that, even though it's a little faded, and sorry

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.440
for the folks in the podcast feed, but we're looking at Yars' Revenge, but with very clearly

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.720
some different and upgraded graphics.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:35.360
So it's not just that they're, again, repackaging all of their old shit and putting it out,

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:39.680
they're actually reimagining a lot of these things, and that part is kind of interesting,

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:40.680
I actually think.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.200
Like NES Remix, but Atari?

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:49.520
Yeah, kinda, or actually it's NES Remix meets WarioWare meets Atari, because these are micro

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:50.800
games, they're saying.

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:54.220
See, that's how they should be doing that kind of stuff.

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.360
That's the way to do it.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.280
That's like the Namco approach almost.

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:01.880
That's why this actually kind of caught my attention, because I was like, wait a minute,

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.860
this is different.

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:08.740
And what is also kind of neat about this is that you have the mashup games, they also

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:15.900
say it is a neo-retro art update to the classic Atari 2600 style, and you can do fully playable

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:21.860
versions in the treasure trove of these remastered Atari classics that you unlock by completing

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.860
cheeky challenges, that's how you know it's a British dev.

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:30.180
It's cheeky challenges that you will complete to do this.

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:35.620
So it caught my attention, because you know I love retro shit, my only thing about this

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:41.780
is I'm like, this game, honestly, is like 15 years late.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.980
This game is 15 years late.

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:48.620
This should have been, like somebody is really late to the party, but alright, they finally

01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:52.900
figured out that something like this could be pretty big, so I wish them luck, I really

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:53.900
really do.

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:59.620
So, yeah, let's see, Tigerclass says, I remember that remake of Yars Revenge that wasn't like

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:03.180
the original, it was the game with the name Yars Revenge slapped on it.

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:09.020
That was just Atari selling their IP for a quick buck, because they were otherwise financially

01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.060
insolvent.

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.100
So that's all that was.

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:15.060
They did it with Centipede, I think it's or Millipede or one of them.

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.500
Dartisius says, I did pick up the other Atari collection on Switch, but this sounds a lot

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:19.500
more fun.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:23.700
Yeah, it's a little jazzed up, and it's a little kind of revisiting those games.

01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:29.820
And if you think about it, those Atari 2600 games were kind of micro games.

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:32.540
They were very repetitive.

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:38.620
That's kind of the charm and the zen of them, in my opinion, but video games were very different

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:46.940
when you only had, what, what does 4K translate into, 4,092 characters to code with?

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:51.060
Yeah, your games got a little repetitive, because you only had so much space to actually

01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:55.660
code with, and they had to do some really clever things to make things fit in that much

01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:56.660
space.

01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:57.660
So.

01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.660
All right.

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:03.140
Anyway, before we get to our next story, I see Dark Sakura commenting, Loki, on your

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:06.840
video and some of the characters there, like Deepcoat.

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.160
And I didn't- It's hilarious that it's Deepcoat.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:12.620
I didn't ask in the beginning of the show, like I usually do, because I was too distracted

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.780
by having to run things tonight.

01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:17.120
What is the game playing behind you live on Twitch tonight?

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.060
It's Fashion Police Squad.

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:20.060
Oh.

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:23.020
I think you got Captain Jack hanging out there.

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:24.020
That's funny.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.020
Okay.

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.020
It looks pretty awesome.

01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:27.200
I want to check that out.

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.220
I would take it that Deepcoat is supposed to be a reference to Deepthroat.

01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:31.220
Oh, I'm sure.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.220
I'm sure.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.220
Yeah.

01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:34.220
But that Fashion Police- Look at the history, people.

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:35.220
Looked funny.

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.600
Fashion Police is the first person shooter, but it's, you're literally the Fashion Police,

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:43.860
so I mean- It's like Doom, but you're, you know, basically running around and shooting

01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:47.820
people to make them, you know, more fashionable.

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:48.820
Yes.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.660
You're shooting them with style.

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:53.220
Dark Soccer, one of us needs to play this on stream, or both of us.

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:54.220
It's like fun.

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:55.220
All right.

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:56.220
We'll see.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.220
We'll see.

01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.220
All right.

01:21:58.220 --> 01:21:59.220
Let's move on.

01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:00.220
Dark Soccer, we can go to you.

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:02.020
Well, how about like super cool games?

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:07.580
Like one of my favorite series is the Raiden series.

01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:14.020
And Limited Run Games, bless them, is doing physical releases, actually a combined physical

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:22.500
release of Raiden 4 x Mikado Remix and Raiden 5 Director's Cut Duel.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:30.500
It's actually the- The Duel Pack is what they're all called together, but anyway, it is like

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:38.820
two of the- I mean, honestly, to me, the pinnacle of the series was Raiden DX Deluxe, but still.

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:43.180
But even so, I think it's really awesome that this is coming out.

01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:49.540
They are available separately in the Nintendo eShop, but if you like physical copies and

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:58.100
one of both, the orders are up for the games as of June 21st, which is two days from today

01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.940
for us here on Sunday, so that'll be Tuesday.

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:11.260
The price will be $49.99 US, and it's honestly, I mean, it's a write-in game.

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.480
How could you go wrong?

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:18.560
And also, Raiden 5 Director's Cut had like a cheer attack in it that I thought was kind

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:24.840
of interesting, and voice acting in the series.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:31.640
So some pretty neat stuff in there, but I mean, come on, you know the weapon everybody

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:34.920
wants in the Raiden games?

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.200
The electric thing.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.640
That is the coolest weapon that exists.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:45.200
Did I ever tell you about the time I beat Raiden on PlayStation while I was drunk on

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.200
Everclear?

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.200
No.

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:52.840
Well, you remember also at my birthday party at Dave & Buster's, when I was playing Luminess

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:57.120
and got to like level 30-something, very drunk.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:02.100
I don't know what it is, but if I'm like super inebriated like that, I will either completely

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:07.840
bomb something or kick so much ass at it, because I think I'm playing just like on instinct.

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:14.400
That night, after many shots of Everclear, I beat Raiden on PlayStation.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.600
I don't know how.

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.380
It was magic.

01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:19.580
Magical Everclear.

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:20.580
It certainly was.

01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:21.580
Please drink responsibly.

01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.000
I felt like it was magic.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.240
My liver might not have, and also that was the, was it that night or the one in Ocean

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.240
Sweets?

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.040
But anyway, it was like, I think that was one of the nights I learned that I can't get

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.040
a hangover.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.040
Huh.

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.040
All right.

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.240
All right.

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:38.040
Well, I thought I thought you'd enjoy that story.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:39.040
Dark Sakura.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.040
It seems.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.040
Yeah, I did.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:44.040
I linked it to Dan right away, because why wouldn't we have this?

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:49.440
I mean, probably because we are oh, I need to take a tangent.

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.440
OK, it's fine.

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.440
We have room for that tonight.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.440
Yeah.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.440
So Dan sold Mustang.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.440
Oh, shit.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.440
I didn't know that.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.440
Oh, wow.

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.440
OK.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.440
He sold it to a friend.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.440
Keep it in the family.

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.800
And he has started working on converting our garage to a game room.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:06.760
I was like, you needed the room in the garage for more pinball machines that badly where

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.360
he finally sold the Mustang.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.440
Well, I want I want them out of the living room for sure.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.880
I mean, I'd like to actually be able to, you know, go back to doing my weightlifting in

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.880
the living room.

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.880
Uh huh.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:29.040
But he he's already looking into sound tiles to to lay out in it and in the shape of one

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.400
of the Space Invaders.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.720
Oh, I love that.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.680
And looking into like carpeting options, like I saw some things on our Amazon view list

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.960
because Dan and I share our Amazon account.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.840
That's so you get to have a garage arcade.

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:47.320
Loki gets to have a garage arcade with his DDR machine.

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.320
My age.

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.320
You have a garage.

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.320
Yeah.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.640
My HOA rules force us to park the cars in the garage.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.200
So whomp.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.080
But that's why I you know what?

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.080
I have my own office.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.800
And I said, what you don't see on cam.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.800
I'll show it.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:04.000
I'm it's not going to look as good on stream, but I'm thinking about it.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:10.680
I have a big walk in closet right to the side of where the machine is.

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.840
And it would hold about four or five of those arcade one ups very nicely.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.960
It's actually a full on like you can walk in there and stuff.

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.840
So I'm actually a little bit bigger than mine.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.840
Yeah.

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.740
I'm thinking about moving the cabinets in there, even though it might not make as good

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:26.480
of a background for when I'm streaming and stuff.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:28.520
I think that would be fun.

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:34.200
I'll tell you what one of my friends does with her walk in closet, who's also a podcaster.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:38.600
She converted her closet completely to a studio.

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:41.920
Oh.

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:42.920
With sound tiles.

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:43.920
Oh yeah.

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:44.920
Because lights and things.

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:45.920
It's so yeah.

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:46.920
Noise dampening in there.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:47.920
Yeah.

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920
Yeah.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:49.920
It's not a bad idea.

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:50.920
Yeah.

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:51.920
It would be easy to do.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.280
I mean, you could even, you know, if you really got, you know, interested in it, you could

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:59.120
paint like whatever backdrop chroma key green.

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.120
Yeah.

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:05.440
Cause I was going to say that works well for a podcast only, but for doing the video stuff,

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:09.080
it's not the most engaging background and less, but it sounds like your friend kind

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:11.360
of did some work arounds to make it better.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:16.800
So that's why you have like, you know, lights hanging from the door or, you know, neat little

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.520
sign behind you.

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.520
Yeah.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.520
Anything is possible.

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.520
True.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.520
True.

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.520
Yeah.

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.520
All right.

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:29.080
I'm going to be your fashion expert, your interior decorator for decorating closet.

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.960
So you're going to play fashion police IRL.

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.960
No, I'm not going to be a police.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.760
I'm not going to like shoot people with style.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.760
Oh, okay.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.360
I'm just going to be like, you could do better.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:39.360
Okay.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:44.840
Girl, if you're going to be in the closet, at least make sure the closet is pretty.

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.640
Some good advice here on pride month.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.640
All right.

01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:53.320
Let's move on to our next story, Logie.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:02.040
So Nintendo has now been striking down YouTube musicians who have been covering different

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:05.320
tracks of Nintendo's properties.

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:14.040
So one of one person that got a strike recently or was Cinemax, who is a child dedicated music

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:20.080
and he was creating he was doing some covers of some Metroid Prime songs.

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:24.160
And apparently that got their attention, which is weird because like I've seen a lot of other

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:27.360
like, I mean, there's so many like Nintendo remixes.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:33.200
I'm surprised they haven't gone after like, you know, some of these other remix sites

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.200
and stuff.

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:40.160
But apparently, you know, they're sending copyright claims, you know, they have the

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.760
legal right to take the content down and, you know, Cinemax acknowledges that the songs

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.680
are owned and copyrighted by Nintendo.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:54.780
However, you know, doesn't really agree with their aggressive tactics for like kind of

01:28:54.780 --> 01:29:03.080
treating like the fans and people that make fan creations based off of some of their IP.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:05.680
So this I found very interesting.

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:10.040
So Bobby got into this on his show tonight and he's in chat kind of reinforcing some

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:12.240
of the same stuff he got into on his show.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:17.640
And I thought he made a damn good point about this whole story is he said that in the story

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:21.720
that the person who got the copyright claim or whatever said they were called by Nintendo's

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.680
lawyers to take him down.

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.240
We have to stop and think about that statement for a minute.

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.220
Since when have Nintendo's lawyers ever talked to people on the phone?

01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:34.480
And I guess it's never they're not going to do that.

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:41.260
They're not going to do that because if it's legal, they have to have proof that it happened.

01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:45.600
And the way that there's you can't prove a phone conversation because recording recorded

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.840
conversations are not a miserable evidence.

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:54.320
The proof is a registered or certified letter that is in writing that you mailed to the

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.320
person or the company or whoever the offending is.

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:00.840
That's why it's a cease and desist letter that you always hear.

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:01.840
That's why it's the term.

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.540
It's never a cease and desist phone call.

01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:09.400
And also with it being in writing from attorney also makes it privileged information.

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:12.080
Sorry, I had a little spill here.

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.560
So Loki, I'm not trying to step on your toes or anything, but I'm pointing out something

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:21.200
that's interesting that's happening here with the internet wildfire of this story that's

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.320
going on.

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:27.520
And I get everybody likes to dunk on Nintendo's copyright thing.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:33.040
And they've earned this, that people are able to jump to this conclusion.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:40.260
But something doesn't add up and I'm not, you know, again, I, but I'm not saying, I'm

01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:46.860
not saying that this person is necessarily lying because somebody else who had a beef

01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:52.700
with this person could have called posing to be Nintendo's lawyers and doing this whole

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:53.700
thing.

01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:57.500
So I'm not saying this person is necessarily a bad actor at face value.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:01.060
I wouldn't want to say that because then his lawyers could send me a letter accusing me

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:07.380
of something, but I'm just saying lawyers don't call people.

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:08.700
Something doesn't add up here.

01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:13.260
It is a little strange.

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:18.600
The only remote thing that I could even think of to give it some feasibility is if the guy

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:25.060
actually had like a buddy that worked at Nintendo and someone gave him a warning or I don't,

01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:30.140
that wouldn't even be, that's like the only thing I could remotely think.

01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:32.060
I can see.

01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:33.060
Yeah.

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.980
I don't know if, but I, yeah.

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:39.220
And like maybe somebody is doing the phone call as a favor and that whole thing where

01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:43.100
it's like, it gets translated into, I was told to stop.

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:48.580
No, a friend told you, you should stop or else the lawyer's going to get involved.

01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:51.040
But you took that to here.

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:54.300
I got told to stop by the lawyer.

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:57.660
Let that, and we all, we can all think of a case in our lives, whether it happened to

01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:02.060
us or somebody else where that game of telephone absolutely played out.

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.060
It is really weird though.

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:08.300
Cause like I, there's so many, I mean, unless they were really close to like the original

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:13.580
pieces of music, I mean, there's so many Nintendo music channels out there that are

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:19.900
just like remixes and like, I just, it doesn't make any sense.

01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.580
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, also this cover artist only has about 7K subs, not a big fish

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:25.860
in the cover music pond.

01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:28.260
So this is great for your attention.

01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.260
So yeah.

01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:32.720
And again, Loki, I'm not, you know, you're, you're just bringing, again, this is a show

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:35.300
about video games and video game culture.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:37.200
And this story is everywhere right now.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.720
And that's why I'm saying, hold up, tap the break because we do have a tendency sometimes

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:46.900
to copy paste these stories, these headlines and things to share on social media without

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:49.740
stopping to look and say, does the math add up?

01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:53.280
Because there's a question mark here.

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:59.360
And again, it might not be this, you know, I, it might not be the individual, the cover

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:07.000
artist is probably could, could for all we know, completely be accounting the truth as

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.280
they see it.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:15.560
But as SSJ 100 Matt says in chat, and this is it, nail meathead, if people can swat someone,

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.720
they can fake a Nintendo lawyer call.

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:22.160
Yeah, I mean, it makes sense.

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:27.040
So anyway, just something to think about.

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:30.760
Let's see, yeah, Mike Defton chat says not to make them less.

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:36.480
Yeah, I mean, like, and I will sit here and say, this guy has more subs than our podcast

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.000
does.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.080
So kudos to him on that.

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:42.800
There are way bigger remix channels and haven't got struck down or something.

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:43.680
Yeah, it's a little weird.

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:49.360
Like, why would you go after the little guy unless, unless your video game covers were laced

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:54.320
with disparaging comments about Nintendo or something or false accusation?

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:57.920
I'm not saying they are, I'm just saying that might be a way that your smaller channel would

01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.000
get more attention.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.440
But I don't think that's the case here.

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:06.520
So, so you know what I just said, since we're a small podcast, we can say anything we want.

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.560
I know, just so much freedom.

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:19.920
Although the one time we did say something that somebody didn't like, somebody did get a phone

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.880
call, actually, now that I think about it, but we won't go there.

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.960
This is a time of celebration.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:27.840
All right.

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:28.880
Oh, you.

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:33.160
Moving on, let's go to our next story.

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.280
Oh, this is one that I thought was pretty cool, because this is like a one from the vaults type of

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:38.720
story.

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.240
This is about an unreleased NES prototype that has come to light.

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.800
It is the game The Fairyland Story.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:52.520
It was originally in arcades in 1985, and now we have found that this was being ported at one

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:58.960
point to the NES by Hard Four Games and Forest of Illusion, I think are the ones that actually

01:34:58.960 --> 01:34:59.840
found this game.

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.720
But it was going to be released in 86, 87.

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:05.880
It had a brief mention in a Japanese magazine.

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:06.800
It didn't happen.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.520
There were some differences from the arcade game, such as there's only 50 levels in the game

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.320
instead of 101 and the 50 loop over and over.

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:21.680
But what's kind of neat is that this old ROM has been rediscovered.

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.320
So you can check that out.

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.640
Also, it should be pointed out.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:31.480
There is this NES original, but if you want to support the real thing, it's also on arcade

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:34.400
archives, because you know how Nintendo has that whole arcade.

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.720
I've seen PlayStation 4 and 5 have it too, is the arcade archives.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:43.080
If you actually want to play the original arcade version, but if you want to play the

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:46.160
unreleased version, that ROM is out there on the Internet.

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.440
It's not hard to find because this story is everywhere right now.

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:53.200
But I'll give you a hint, forestdelusion.com is the site that hasn't.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.680
So I think it's kind of neat.

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:59.920
It's always neat to see games that like we weren't supposed to see.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.360
So it's a little piece of gaming history.

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:10.360
I might have already gotten the ROM right after it came out.

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.080
Did you play it yet?

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.120
No, not yet.

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:17.640
I remember I've been playing through a bunch of other stuff, so it's back there.

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:26.000
I have a few other prototypes actually that I need to take a look at, like, hold on, I'm

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.760
actually going to pull up the list of the ones I need to play.

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:41.880
But I've got like Bio Force Ape and I have Fairyland, I have Fighting Golf.

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.960
I have another one called Hattori.

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:55.400
So I also have a prototype of Rensaber, Star Soldier prototype for the NES.

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.320
Random stuff.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.640
Yeah, just really, really random.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.240
All right.

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.200
Well, since we brought up classic games, I think it's a great segue into our next segment.

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:24.200
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:27.400
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:33.480
But once a month, DarkSakura says, you know what, I'm going to mix it up and pick a classic electronic handheld.

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.560
So what is the classic handheld of the month?

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:38.240
We have a digital monster.

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:52.000
Basically, when Bandai released the Tamagotchi, they also released a, you know, just because the Tamagotchi was really marketed more for like girls.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:01.680
So in true gendered, you know, tradition, they released one for the boys called the digital monster or Digimon.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:07.560
It was, you know, it's another type of virtual pet, but this one could be a fighting pet.

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:18.600
So you would, you know, raise your pet and then you had these little, like these little connectors at the bottom where your Digimon could battle or more like at the top.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.720
But going back to it, let's just start with a little bit of history on it.

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:29.680
So it was released by Bandai on June 26, 1997 in Japan and December 5, 1997 in North America.

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:44.000
The original digital monster model sold 14 million units worldwide, including 13 million in Japan and 1 million overseas by March 2004.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:55.800
And by 2005, it had, there were more than 24 million digital monster units sold worldwide.

01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:08.560
In 2017, they did a 20th anniversary edition that was released in Japan that let the owner choose any of the eggs from the first five versions of the toy and then some new unlocked ones through various different methods.

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:15.720
And that came out worldwide in 2019, which was the anniversary outside of Japan.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:20.800
So we're going to go ahead and start with just the basics with this.

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:45.800
I mean, you can see in the video for those who are watching, you know, feed them a little squishy, whatever, Mon, but you can check the pet status, age, weight, strength, hunger, energy, or feed the Digimon to make him full, increase its strength, increase its energy, you know, train the Digimon so that it loses weight and increases strength.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:56.800
You have your battle mode where you link the two together through these little readers on the top, and then they can have a battle.

01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:08.800
You can also clean up their poo. If you don't clean up their poo, the Digimon becomes sick. You can toggle the light, like, okay, it's that right here in the video is what the little connectors look like.

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:28.800
But you can turn the light on and off in this little virtual house so that the Digimon can sleep. If you leave the light on while they're sleeping, then their condition decreases and you would not have a chance of a high powered evolution.

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:39.800
And then there's healing your Digimon. If your Digimon gets sick or injured in battle, you would have to heal them before they can battle again.

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:47.800
So the original Digimon device had three buttons and a reset button all on the right hand side of the screen.

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:55.800
There's A to go through your icons and options. The middle B would activate the function and C cancels whatever is on the screen.

01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:11.800
And pressing A and C simultaneously toggles the sound, which, you know, mutes or unmutes in the reset button, is that little tiny hole that was between the B and C button and you would have to use like a pen or a pen to do the reset.

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:23.800
The metal contacts is where they would touch to be able to communicate. Well, that wasn't all for Digimon.

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:35.800
So we got, in 1998, the Pendulum series came out that introduced the Jogress function. So you could combine your Digimon.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:55.800
The Pendulum would count the number of times the device has been shaken. And then there was the Pendulum Progress series. After that, the Pendulum X series that was accompanied by Digimon Chronicle for the, it was a story that came out.

01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:14.800
There was Digimon Mini. There was a Wonderswan that had the original Digimon as a game. There's the 20th Anniversary one, Digimon Pendulum 20th Anniversary, Digimon X, which was the original one that had the 20th Anniversary features, and the Pendulum X series.

01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:27.800
There's Digimon Pendulum Z. All kinds of stuff. I mean, well, and then let's not forget what spawned from this little, you know, brick looking thing.

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:47.800
We had the Digimon, there were Digimon anime that, and you know how I feel about the Digimon anime. I think that the first two series are super superior to basically any other thing.

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:59.800
And then Digimon Tribe makes my heart happy and a little bit sad in some ways. There's also a manga called Come On Digimon. There were just all kinds of stuff in it.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:19.800
And then I also had like the, the D3, which were the, actually I had a Digivice and Dan gave it to Julie. And I kept saying, don't give it to her. It's mine. You cannot give something that is mine to somebody else.

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:32.800
And I still want it back to this day, but no one knows where anything is at Julie's house. And then I had the, the D3 and I had the black D3 with the little laptop thingy that they had.

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:42.800
Cause I, like I said, I was super into Digimon 02 and I actually ended up giving them to a friend who was a really big fan only to realize that the D3, the black D3 was the short pack.

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:59.800
So, oh well. So yeah, I mean, there has been like nine Digimon series and a bunch of films and a bunch of games and a bunch of manga.

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:14.800
And there was a Ma Hua in China. There was a Dark Horse comics. There's a Italian one or called, done by a group called Panini.

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:31.800
It was, it's just, there's the card game. There's a card game too. So, I mean, there's just all kinds of merchandising and it all came from this little brick, this little brick wall looking thing.

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:49.800
And I had the blue one. My, I would always somehow or another evolve a Devimon without fail. I don't know how, but I always had a Devimon. So, and there we go. It is, it's the digital monster.

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:59.800
A quick comment from our chat where as Joe and Hunter Matt says, oh God, I remember confiscating these from kids when I was summer camp counselor, and of course returning them at the end of the day.

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:06.800
We did this because they would always lose it and then we'd have to hear about it or run around hunting them down. Those kids were five at the time.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:12.800
Now those kids are going to be 28 to 29 now. BRB going to find a corner to rock and cry in the fetal position for a bit.

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:25.800
Glad you could feel the same thing. We feel a lot here on this program. But yeah, these things, these things are also very well known for getting taken away from kids at school quite often.

01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:37.800
We were all like in our early twenties and we all had our Digimon and our pocket Pikachu. And I had my Puyo Lin because I was cooler than everybody.

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.800
What's a Puyo Lin? Puyo Puyo is the best. Shut up.

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:45.800
I was gonna say, I'm pretty sure I had it like a Tamagotchi in like college.

01:45:46.800 --> 01:46:02.800
Yeah. Well, I mean, I remember it was just like, we would always bust a mountain, see who would win. And we were like different like, and everyone like else, like had their Tamagotchi and we had our Digimon and we're like, we're edgier. We're cooler.

01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.800
So we're so fucking edgy.

01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:12.800
All right. Let's travel around and check out some edgy headlines. No, literally, they're on the edge of tonight's show. Roll just a few quick headlines.

01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.800
You'll pay for the whole seat, but you'll only need the edge.

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:21.800
Some rapid fire news. Loki, why don't you start us off?

01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:33.800
I'll leave it up to modders to put in characters in the games that they wanted, but never got. So we have Chrono from Chrono Trigger being added to Smash Brothers Ultimate.

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:43.800
I'm not sure who this character actually replaces, but it even gives Kirby a custom outfit as well, which is kind of funny.

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:49.800
It's an, I'm sorry, Chrono is an alternative costume for Hero from Dragon Quest.

01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.800
That makes sense.

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:51.800
Neat.

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:53.800
Character model looks really good.

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.800
Yeah, it does. It looks pretty cool.

01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:01.800
And I'm really impressed with modding communities. This is amazing.

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:12.800
And then we have the Nintendo 64 version of Pokemon Snap coming to the Nintendo Switch online on June 24th as part of the online expansion pack.

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:16.800
I'm paying for it still.

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:22.800
I know. I was like, honestly, this is the most compelling case yet for me to maybe sign up for that pack.

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.800
You know, I still don't have it after all this time. Never got the expansion.

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:29.800
Maybe, maybe I'll break one of these days. We'll see. But not yet.

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:33.800
All right. Let's go to Dark Soccer.

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:35.800
I think you have one quick story.

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:38.800
Treasure. Treasure is one of my favorite companies.

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:48.800
They have given me so many wonderful games, including one of my husband's favorite games, Gunstar Heroes and Silhouette Mirage.

01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:54.800
And Doki Doki Mischief Makers, Wario World, Sin and Punishment.

01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:07.800
But there was a tweet put out by by Treasure's Twitter that said that they are working on a highly requested title in a tweet that was celebrating their 30th anniversary.

01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:14.800
It roughly translates to on June 19th, 2022, Treasure Inc celebrates its 30th anniversary.

01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:21.800
In this 30th anniversary year, we are working hard to release quote that unquote title that has been requested by many of you.

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:26.800
We look forward to your continued support of Treasure.

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:27.800
We don't know what it'll be.

01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:32.800
I think that the the byline on this one is please be Sin and Punishment three.

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.800
It'll be that game.

01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:37.800
They just it's that it's a game called that.

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.800
I would like another Silhouette Mirage.

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:42.800
We'll see. We'll see.

01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:45.800
They did it. They did a Gunstar Heroes follow up.

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:46.800
Yeah.

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.800
So I wonder if it'll be a Sin and Punishment three.

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:52.800
I bet a lot of people would be very happy to see that.

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:53.800
So, yeah.

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:54.800
All right.

01:48:54.800 --> 01:49:04.800
Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games you'll be playing a lot sooner than you will Sin and Punishment three.

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:06.800
I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games.

01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:07.800
I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games.

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:10.800
I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games.

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:25.800
I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games this week, but we've got looks like Fall Guys getting a release on PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series and Nintendo Switch.

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:32.800
Shadowrun trilogy is going to be out on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:36.800
We've got Wreckfest coming to Nintendo Switch.

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:45.800
And then, let's see, Sonic Origins on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:53.800
AI, the Sonium Files, Nirvana Initiative on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:49:53.800 --> 01:50:00.800
Capcom Fighting Collection on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:06.800
And last but not least, Fire Emblem Three Hopes on Nintendo Switch.

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:14.800
Going over to Japan. Yeah, it's a it's a fairly busy week there and some of the same tentpole games that Loki said for the US are also hitting Japan the same week.

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:18.800
That includes Fire Emblem Warriors Three Hopes on the Switch.

01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:23.800
Also on the Switch, we have the Capcom Fighting Collection making its way there as well.

01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:28.800
We also have that AI Somnium Files Nirvana Initiative that Loki referenced.

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.800
We also have a game called Nine Nine.

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:33.800
So it's the number nine and then it's the word nine spelled out.

01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:35.800
That is also coming out in Japan.

01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:39.800
And it looks like it looks like another like dating sim type of thing.

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:41.800
So we'll leave it at that.

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:42.800
I think a visual novel though.

01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:44.800
Yeah, visual novel type of thing.

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.800
Ayoku no Istuya, Angel's Blessing in a regular limited edition.

01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:51.800
Miike no Looper Celia in a regular limited edition.

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:55.800
Also hitting the Switch this week and Code Realize future blessings.

01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:57.800
Also making its way out to Japan this week.

01:50:57.800 --> 01:51:01.800
All of that on the Switch on the PlayStation five this week.

01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:03.800
Nothing.

01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:08.800
But the PlayStation four sees many of those same releases we already outlined on the Switch.

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:12.800
I don't really see a whole lot of differences or anything unique.

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:14.800
It's pretty much a lot of the same games I've seen.

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:17.800
So we'll go over to Japan, Dark Sakura.

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:18.800
We're going to Europe.

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:19.800
I'm sorry.

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:22.800
We're going to leave Japan and go to Europe.

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:27.800
On the 21st for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch, we have Zorro the Chronicles.

01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:30.800
Also on the 21st for Switch, we have Wreckfest.

01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:34.800
On the 23rd for PlayStation, we have Audubon Police Simulator 3.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:38.800
And on the 24th for Switch, we have Fire Emblem Warriors 3.

01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:39.800
And that's it.

01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:40.800
All right.

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:43.800
Got a few titles there that are coming out worldwide.

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:44.800
All right.

01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:47.800
Well, that was all we had for headlines tonight.

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:50.800
So we get to go to have an empty mailbox.

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:51.800
We have an empty mailbox.

01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:52.800
That's a shame.

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:53.800
I just want to point.

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:57.800
I don't want to guilt you all or anything, but I do want to point out next week is our

01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:00.800
20th anniversary.

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.800
And Rob, what do you want to say?

01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:05.800
I want to point out that next week is our 20th anniversary.

01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:07.800
And Rob wants to make me work.

01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:08.800
I'd love to hear you.

01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:12.800
I'm willing to share the responsibilities if we were to actually get flooded with emails,

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:17.800
especially some of you we haven't heard from in a very long time or ever.

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:21.800
Consider this your cordial invitation to email us.

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:23.800
Participate at orangelaundry.com.

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:24.800
Are you lazy?

01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:25.800
Fine.

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:26.800
Write a tweet at OLR.

01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:28.800
I don't always read the tweets, but I'll read them next week.

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:29.800
Do?

01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:30.800
What's that?

01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:31.800
Voice to text.

01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:32.800
Yeah.

01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:33.800
Dictation.

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:34.800
Yeah.

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:35.800
Yeah.

01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:36.800
Just any of that.

01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:41.800
Uh, I would just love to hear since it is the 20 year anniversary, just tell us like,

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:44.800
what, why do you listen?

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:46.800
Like, what, what can we do more of?

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:47.800
What do you like?

01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:48.800
What do you not like?

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:49.800
You know what?

01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:50.800
It's a birthday show.

01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:51.800
Don't tell us what you don't like.

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:52.800
Tell us what you like.

01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:55.800
Then the next week, tell us what you don't like.

01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:58.800
Um, tell us how you started listening to us and what's kept you here.

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:00.800
I just, I would love to hear from you.

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:02.800
So, uh, yeah.

01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:04.800
Send us those emails, tweets, whatever.

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:05.800
Sure.

01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:06.800
TikTok says Bobby Black Wolf.

01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:07.800
Why not?

01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:08.800
Why not?

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:10.960
But in the meantime, we do have our green room.

01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:16.640
We have live phone calls, uh, available and we do have somebody who wants to call in tonight.

01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:18.560
So I think we should get to that person.

01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:19.560
Hello.

01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:20.560
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.560
Who's this?

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:23.260
Hey, it's the one and only Rama.

01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:24.320
How is everybody doing tonight?

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:25.680
I am doing great.

01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:26.800
And it's great to hear from you.

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:27.800
Rama.

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:28.800
How are you?

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:29.800
Good.

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:30.800
Good.

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.800
There we go.

01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:34.080
I love having an extended vacation, extended weekend.

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.080
You know.

01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:36.080
How did we lose Loki?

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:37.640
Well, Happy Juneteenth.

01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:38.640
Now on this.

01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:39.640
Thank you.

01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:40.640
Thank you.

01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:41.640
All right.

01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:47.240
Now, so while I fix the camera, to what do we owe this lovely phone call tonight?

01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:48.280
A couple of things.

01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:59.040
Number one, Final Fantasy 7, I just want to say, as I played through the game, I noticed

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.040
some differences.

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:03.720
I'm just like, okay, let's see where this goes.

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:08.880
When I finished the first game, I was talking to one of my besties, Chibi Tifa.

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:14.760
We basically said, by the time you finish the first game, if you don't realize this

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:20.600
is not the original FF7 you're playing, you need to go back to the drawing board.

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:25.440
We were watching people on Twitter lose their proverbial shit over this because they're

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:31.560
getting angry and upset at how much this deviates from the original.

01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:35.480
As somebody who has played through the original game, I'm all for it.

01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:39.640
I don't know how you could miss that it deviates from the original.

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:42.600
Again, I'm not trying to spoil every detail.

01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:48.280
They kill someone who wasn't killed in the original as a way to explain that this is

01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:49.280
different.

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:51.320
Rob, it's been 25 years.

01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:52.320
Spoil away.

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.320
I'm sorry.

01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:54.320
Like y'all said earlier.

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.320
In the remakes.

01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.320
The remake's two years old, so yeah.

01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:58.320
Okay.

01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:00.080
The remake's been two years.

01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:01.600
It's dirt cheap now.

01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:03.960
It's been on PlayStation Plus.

01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:04.960
I'm sorry.

01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.040
There's no NDA on spoiling it at this point.

01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.040
Yes, I know.

01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:09.040
I know.

01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:11.760
But I'm going to leave it at that.

01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:12.920
I made my point.

01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:15.840
I'll leave it at that.

01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:18.360
People are quite upset about this.

01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:20.840
I get it and I understand it.

01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:27.280
I'm like this, here's a chance to retell the entire series.

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:32.880
I mean, hell, if you have the official strategy guide, it has everything listed out for eras,

01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:37.280
weapons, all of that, and you mean to tell me in the original game, the only way I could

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:40.080
play her after she dies is to use a GameShark?

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:41.080
Come on.

01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:42.080
Come on.

01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:46.200
Well, you know, it's for plot purposes.

01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:49.680
What do you think about the whole renaming of the game too?

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:52.900
Because a lot of people were expecting it would be called Remake Part 2, but now we

01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:55.240
know that the game is called Rebirth.

01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:57.540
What did you think when you heard the title?

01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:04.000
I was legitimately curious because I could not put my finger on it as to why it's Rebirth,

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.160
but you nailed it.

01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:07.160
You nailed it.

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:12.400
That makes the most amount of sense because part one, yes, it's a remake.

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:17.800
Going back to the board, they're remaking certain things, they're fleshing certain stories

01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:20.620
about certain tropes, characters.

01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:25.840
By the time you finish the first game, you automatically know it's going somewhere else.

01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:31.920
So that Rebirth, all right, it's like, we're going to go back to the drawing board one

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:33.000
more time.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.360
We're going to do things way different and we're going to go in a different direction.

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:42.160
I'm going to place money on the third part being called Resurrected or Resurrection,

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:43.260
some form of that.

01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:45.040
I'm going to say this.

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.620
There is the particular character that dies.

01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:51.880
Now we all know originally she was killed.

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:59.040
I believe in the new trilogy, if she does die, it's her choice.

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:05.060
She understands everything that's going on and it's her choice to do it.

01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:06.060
Yes.

01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:07.060
Yes.

01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:11.500
I think that will be a very big element that couldn't be explored in the original.

01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:15.380
I think you're spot on with that and you can say it's Eryth because again, for the 25 year

01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:19.500
old game, I don't care about the spoiler, for the two year old game, I'll try to watch

01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:22.980
my mouth and that's all you get.

01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:27.680
But I'm not going to, if it falls out, if I say, oops.

01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:31.740
But as far as that goes, I think you're absolutely right.

01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:39.020
I think if she does die, she wanted to, or she felt a need that she had to, which was

01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:40.800
kind of that way in the original.

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.820
She felt she had to.

01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:48.180
But yeah, I think it's going to be a lot more explicit in a way that it wasn't before.

01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:53.140
Ooh, Bobby Black Wolf suggests Resolution as the third game title.

01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:54.140
Oh, I like that.

01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:55.140
I like that.

01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:56.140
That could work, yeah.

01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:59.140
Re-vengeance says Mike Deft.

01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:00.140
No.

01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:01.140
Re-vengeance.

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:07.580
Revolution, like Dance Dance Revolution, but people will get the wrong, people wouldn't

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:08.860
get that reference, so nevermind.

01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:10.340
I'm trying to think what other RE.

01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:16.340
Questmaster says Restoration, ah, OK, OK, Restoration.

01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:17.940
Like restoring the original timeline.

01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:18.940
We'll see.

01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:19.940
I don't know.

01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:20.940
I don't know.

01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:21.940
I'll say this much.

01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:25.300
At least I have time to get a PlayStation 5, you know?

01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:26.300
Yeah, right.

01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:27.300
That's where I'm at.

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:34.460
Final Fantasy XVI and VII Rebirth are in 2023, then I have until 2023.

01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:39.640
And it seems very obvious, XVI is loading up the first half of the year, Rebirth is

01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:42.480
bringing up the rear, so if they even make it.

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:44.240
I don't think it'll make it.

01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:49.080
I'm still a little salty that, you know, they didn't announce it for Xbox Series X, even

01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:55.680
though both consoles are basically the same, I would assume as exclusivity, I'm not really

01:58:55.680 --> 01:59:00.400
upset by it, because I said from jump, I'm going to get both consoles.

01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:07.040
And right now, there's only two games on PS5 that I want, and one of them is on PS4 now.

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.240
I'm not even too worried about it.

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:12.400
I'll get both consoles as well, love my Series X, but yeah, there's just going to be stuff

01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:13.920
I need to get a PS5 for.

01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:17.360
The only reason I'm holding out now is I'm just holding out to see if they do a hardware

01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:18.360
refresh.

01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:19.360
That's it.

01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:23.080
Because I know otherwise the minute I buy one, oh, the PS5 Mini or the PS5 Pro or the

01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:27.360
PS5B, whatever is going to come out.

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:32.280
I'm seeing now at the point where when they announce PlayStation 5s are available, you

01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:35.240
can actually, you don't have to rush the websites to get it.

01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:39.680
I've seen them sitting online for up to a day before they're sold out.

01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:44.800
So I'm like, at least I have a fighting chance, at least now I can be like, do I really want

01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:45.800
one?

01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:49.360
Yeah, it's started a website, sold out, I'll wait for the next one.

01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:54.040
You know what else is partially to thank?

01:59:54.040 --> 02:00:04.160
Bitcoin eating shit, because now Bitcoin and let's be clear, Ramen, before we toast, let's

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:10.000
be clear, all cryptocurrency eating massive shit.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Okay.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Okay.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.000
All right.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Okay.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Okay.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.840
I wanted to talk about Shredder's Revenge, but back away, I've only told two people this.

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:24.080
I'm going to tell you all this because y'all are awesome and y'all not going to judge me

02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:25.600
and I still don't care.

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:35.160
I just want you to know from September of last year to I would say January of this year,

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:43.360
I have lost about $7,500 in crypto, but here's the thing, I'm not upset by it.

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:45.240
I'm not really worried by it.

02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:50.680
I've been investing in crypto for like three, four years, total of like three grand.

02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:52.960
It was a long-term investment.

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:58.880
It was just something where after everything is said and done, I'm retiring, cash it out.

02:00:58.880 --> 02:00:59.880
That's all that was.

02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:04.440
And I'm looking at my account, I'm just like, I got my 401k, I got this, I ain't worried

02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:05.440
about it.

02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:09.880
It's just a long-term thing for me.

02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:11.240
If you want to judge me, go right ahead.

02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:12.240
I'm not going to judge you.

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:14.080
Some people foolishly dumped everything in it.

02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:15.080
Yeah.

02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:19.100
I'm not going to judge you because I got on the hype wagon for like maybe for my Reno

02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:21.840
budget in 2021, $150.

02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:25.240
That's it.

02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:30.200
I put in like $5 and cashed it out at $10.

02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:31.200
Good job.

02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:33.040
You're the only one that made money.

02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:34.040
I did Ethereum.

02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:36.280
That's why I did too.

02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:39.880
So at least you have a good attitude about it, Rama.

02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:43.240
So here's to fucking up.

02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:45.080
And I started noticing going down, like, you know what?

02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:46.080
I'm going to stop investing.

02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:47.680
I'm going to leave it right here.

02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:51.880
I'm just going to let whatever's in there roll over and it's slowly making its way back

02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:52.880
up.

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:55.760
If it hits the original amount by end of the year, good.

02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:58.160
If it does not, is what it is.

02:01:58.160 --> 02:01:59.720
I can still pay my bills.

02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:01.360
I can still live my life.

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:05.880
I'm not knocking on relatives door begging for money because I dropped my entire paycheck

02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:07.920
into crypto.

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.480
You know, it's kind of funny.

02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:15.180
It's like, I'm anti NFT, but I'm okay with crypto because I kind of know you're going

02:02:15.180 --> 02:02:17.000
to get something out of crypto.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.480
NFT is like a photocopy receipt.

02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:26.820
And Matt in chat has this and says, main thing is you're not a crypto bro that is calling

02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:28.440
a sheep and that we're wrong.

02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:29.440
Yes.

02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:30.440
That's the clear difference.

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.640
You're a big boy.

02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:33.480
You made a big boy decision.

02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:35.940
A big boy consequence happened.

02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:41.120
And you're just going to have a big boy attitude and say, well, I knew the risk, oops.

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.200
I'm like, I lost.

02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:43.200
It is what it is.

02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:44.480
I'm not crying.

02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:49.280
You know, it's like, it's just like playing the stock market half the time.

02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:50.280
Yeah, exactly.

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:51.280
Exactly.

02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:52.280
Always remember.

02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:54.620
And Questmaster says, always remember, it could have been much, much worse.

02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:57.820
Never invest or bet more than you can stomach to lose.

02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:05.120
Very good advice, especially true with Diablo Immortal and other gotcha games out there.

02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:09.720
I also don't understand why Metacritic shreds the shit out of Diablo Immortal.

02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:12.160
Well, I do, but listen to my full statement here.

02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:17.120
I don't understand why Metacritic shreds the shit out of that game and not plenty of

02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:20.720
other games out there that are just as guilty.

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:23.840
I think because of the name that's attached to it.

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:24.840
Of course it is.

02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:25.840
Of course it is.

02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:26.840
Do you think-

02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:27.840
High expectations.

02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:32.760
Do you, do you know what a fuck fest that Nino, I don't know how else to describe it.

02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:37.640
Do you know what a fuck fest that Nino Cooney game is that just came out?

02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:39.640
Like that game is a mess.

02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:40.640
Don't get me started.

02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:41.640
Do not get me started.

02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.440
That game is a mess.

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:45.240
She's messy, your honor.

02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:48.760
You have been found guilty of public mess.

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:50.640
You have been a mess.

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:53.720
Rob, the last mobile game-

02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:57.120
Mario Kondo can't even fix you, Nino Cooney.

02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:04.600
Look, the last game I actually devoted my time away into playing with Sailor Moon Drops

02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:06.760
until they shut the servers down.

02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:08.360
I wouldn't have to play little other-

02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.600
You got my fucking husband into that game too, damn you.

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.480
Hey, you know, you know it's a damn good game.

02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:15.480
Come on now.

02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:18.360
Someone's trying to bring it back, but good luck to them.

02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:21.000
But when I heard about Nino Cooney, I was like, yo, I am all up in this.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.280
I'm going to jump into this.

02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:23.760
I heard something about NFT.

02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:24.760
Nope.

02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:25.760
Nope.

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:26.760
I'm out.

02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:27.760
Yeah.

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:28.760
That's right.

02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:29.760
You know what?

02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:30.760
If you are one of those people that has spent thousands of dollars on Diablo Immortal and

02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:33.640
you're really mad at us for the earlier conversation, let me give you this.

02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:37.760
At least you haven't spent any time playing Nino Cooney.

02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:40.480
Well, I won't say it was me.

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:42.480
So you can sleep okay tonight.

02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:45.680
I could definitely sleep okay, but I will say this.

02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:52.160
There are people who will just blindly spend that type of money on gotchas left and right.

02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:57.680
I have seen the worst end of that and it ain't pretty.

02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:02.960
Questbuster in chat says Nino Cooney mobile is so bad that players are complaining of

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:08.320
half an hour queue times because bots are hogging up all the spots to farm crypto in

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:09.500
the game.

02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:14.180
There's even an in-game event slated in the future that requires you to link a crypto

02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:17.660
wallet and people aren't happy.

02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:21.940
See that kind of reminds me of when people start playing WoW years ago and the whole

02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:23.460
gold farming and all of that.

02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:26.580
I'm just like, well, you know, hey.

02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:27.580
Anyway.

02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:30.660
Oh, you want to talk about Shredder's Revenge?

02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:33.180
Can we can we have a nice palate cleanser, please?

02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:34.180
Absolutely.

02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:38.500
So what are we having VOD game night to play some play some Shredder's Revenge, man?

02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:40.980
I am absolutely loving this game.

02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:45.900
You can't see it, but I actually took out my fighting game joystick just to play this

02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:46.900
game.

02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:53.180
I felt like twelve fucking years old in the laundromat playing as Donatello going through

02:05:53.180 --> 02:05:54.180
this game.

02:05:54.180 --> 02:06:00.120
I I don't know about you, but I won't say the main thing.

02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:02.340
I won't play that game with you, Rama.

02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:03.340
Why?

02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:04.580
Because I also played Donatello.

02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:05.580
So fuck you.

02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:09.420
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:10.420
You my boy.

02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:12.780
I will gladly switch Leonardo for you.

02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:13.780
That was so good.

02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:14.780
I'm sorry.

02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:15.780
That was so good.

02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:16.780
Wasn't it?

02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:21.060
So I fucking love you.

02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:23.460
Love all of y'all.

02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:25.340
I also am happy to play Leonardo.

02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:28.980
I actually had to step away for a second because there's a spider.

02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:30.980
I'll be right back.

02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:32.140
This you'd be nice to it.

02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:33.540
Is the house going to burn down?

02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:34.540
Are you going to be OK?

02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:35.700
Good.

02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:39.860
Just escorted out of the house and thank you for its work and eating other bugs in your

02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:40.860
house.

02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:41.860
I don't know.

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:42.860
But.

02:06:42.860 --> 02:06:43.860
But.

02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:44.860
If Loki's connection goes down.

02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:48.660
While Raphael is my favorite turtle, my favorite to play is Donatello.

02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:49.660
Yeah.

02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:53.980
It was because the staff had the range and like I didn't like playing Raphael because

02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:56.180
the side didn't have the range at all.

02:06:56.180 --> 02:06:59.300
But I imagine some people that would play him were really good as him.

02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:02.420
So it's just, you know, you you sacrifice distance for speed.

02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:03.420
Yeah.

02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:04.420
Speed, too.

02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:05.420
So.

02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:08.340
But there's always the badass one.

02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:15.540
There is one thing about the game and I that they did and I absolutely lost my shit over.

02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:16.780
It's the font.

02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:23.100
The main font in the game is the original font from the first from both arcade games.

02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:29.020
For me, that's like an ultimate Easter egg, because that's like to me personally, you

02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:34.740
know, it's a turtles game when it's that particular font for like where you're putting

02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:38.940
in your name and the rankings and the credits and stuff like that.

02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:40.140
That had me.

02:07:40.140 --> 02:07:44.860
I'm sure if she wanted to, Dark Soccer could give us a whole seminar on how typography

02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:46.300
invokes emotion.

02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:47.620
And that's kind of the point.

02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:49.620
I see her smiling over there.

02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:55.660
That's why I didn't say anything, because I've said it enough that you know that I'm

02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:58.680
thinking the typography thoughts in my head.

02:07:58.680 --> 02:07:59.680
Exactly.

02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:09.000
So yes, even art invokes emotion and even something as silly as a font will probably

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.560
make you think of certain things.

02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:16.560
Like I don't want to I don't want to like talk us up too much, but you will notice the

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:20.000
font that we use here at VOG Network on the site.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:24.160
It's a font you see a lot of places and sometimes you might see it and go, oh, that's like the

02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:25.160
VOG writing.

02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:26.560
But it's a font.

02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:27.560
It's a font.

02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:28.560
You can see it around.

02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:30.520
I can tell everyone what it is, if you want to know.

02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:33.080
Yeah, it's well, it's your your style.

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:34.080
Yeah.

02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:39.560
So I thought that it looked very futuristic and honestly, it was easy to modify it into

02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:41.200
a power button and it looked really good.

02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:42.200
Yeah.

02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:46.720
Your modified version that's like the VOG logo is great, is totally what a logo should

02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:47.720
be.

02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:48.720
So, yeah.

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:49.720
Yeah.

02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:50.720
Anyway.

02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:55.040
However, I will go on record and say that I like writing letters in Futura and leave

02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:56.600
it at that.

02:08:56.640 --> 02:08:59.680
Articius says, surprised y'all aren't using serpentine bold.

02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:06.440
I get that reference and I almost wanted to use it for the top font here, but it's just

02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:07.440
a little too.

02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:13.240
I didn't love the way it looked, which I actually since I did move everything over from the

02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:14.240
old computer.

02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:16.840
OK, so I'm on Futura bold.

02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:20.500
So since you brought it up.

02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:21.500
That's what it looks like.

02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:26.940
I don't love it because it's a little too thick for me.

02:09:26.940 --> 02:09:30.540
You're not going to hear me say that very often.

02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:34.420
He's got honestly enough, but it actually is.

02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:37.460
It actually is pretty balanced, interesting.

02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:41.780
It's a little like for but for for the top part, I think so.

02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:45.880
But for the bottom half, like I feel like it kind of takes away from where the eyes

02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:47.460
ought to be here.

02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:48.460
Yeah.

02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:49.460
Yeah.

02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:51.340
So that's that's my only issue with it.

02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:56.540
So anyway, it kind of reminds me of the font that we use for anime jam session, because

02:09:56.540 --> 02:10:01.240
let's be real, everybody hates Comic Sans.

02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:03.300
So I stumbled across the comic new way.

02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:05.620
I'm like, oh, this is nice.

02:10:05.620 --> 02:10:09.880
I will tell you one thing about Comic Sans, though, that I learned is that it's easier

02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:13.060
for dyslexic people to read it.

02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:19.900
Interesting, but there's also much better dyslexic centered fonts now.

02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:25.340
Rama, I will take you up on that Turtles game night very soon.

02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:26.340
Stay tuned for details.

02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:31.660
As soon as they get everything settled here, which should be soon, we'll have a go at it.

02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:34.260
Anything else on your mind tonight you want to talk to us about?

02:10:34.260 --> 02:10:38.860
They are brand new digivices out there that look like smartwatches called the Digivices.

02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:39.860
Yeah, I know.

02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:40.860
Yeah.

02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:42.860
There's a couple of people on my Facebook that are kind of wanting them.

02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:43.860
So.

02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:44.860
Awesome.

02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:45.860
All right, my friend.

02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:47.440
Well, I will let you go.

02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:50.320
Take care, anime jam session.

02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:51.480
Listen to it.

02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:52.900
Love it.

02:10:52.900 --> 02:10:54.600
I wish I would touch it.

02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:59.360
We had a big it wasn't anime, but we had a big convention here in SAC this weekend called

02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:03.480
Sinister Creature Con, which is like horror movies and FX.

02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:06.960
I would love to call into your show to talk about it because it's close enough that they

02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:07.960
got cosplay.

02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:09.760
They got all that same stuff, right?

02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:14.640
Actually, you know, that would be in our wheelbarrow because we did cover a couple of steampunk

02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:18.480
conventions years ago when it was popular.

02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:22.320
And one of my friends, she does a lot of those types of conventions anyway.

02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:23.840
One small problem.

02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:24.840
I didn't go.

02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:29.720
And the reason why is that I just had conflicts with timing this weekend.

02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:33.400
I hosted the after party that they did.

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:37.200
We actually had Voltaire, big nerd musician that's done music.

02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:42.040
He's like a DragonCon staple and it's so because I'm like, I even said to him, I said, it's

02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:47.320
so nice to see you like outside DragonCon.

02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:52.280
I totally get that because in September I'm going to a convention called retro cons.

02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:57.240
It's all like 80s and 90s cartoons and toys and stuff.

02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:02.480
And the main reason why I'm going is Venus Terzo is going to be a guest there.

02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:06.560
So you know, I have to get my Ron will have art book autographed by her.

02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:08.160
Oh, I love that.

02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:09.160
Excuse me.

02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:10.160
I love that.

02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:11.160
I love that.

02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:16.160
Right now, me and my friend, we're going to do Velma and Shaggy for the con or Luigi and

02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:17.160
Daisy.

02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:18.160
We just haven't figured it out yet.

02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:19.960
I will say really quick on the Voltaire thing.

02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:23.040
I wanted to take a quick step back because it actually wasn't DragonCon that introduced

02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:24.040
me to him.

02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:27.000
It was Deft that introduced me to him.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:31.380
And because he originally covered that when he was writing, like, I love the song articles

02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:33.920
for the early stages of VOG network site.

02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:38.720
And I remember because I actually really dug the song that he had picked and I did not

02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:39.720
realize.

02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:42.480
Apparently Voltaire is actually just generally pretty popular in Mexico because he told this

02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:49.280
whole story on stage about how his girlfriend heard the song of his at the Mexican DMV and

02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:51.840
like called him to say like your songs on.

02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:53.740
So he had this whole little monologue about it.

02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:58.000
He's a very good performer in the fact that he tells stories with his music.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.000
So it's good.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.680
And then he played the song in English and Spanish, which I thought was really cute.

02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:03.800
So yeah, that is really cool.

02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:04.800
Yeah.

02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:12.040
Let's do a cosplay crossover with Luigi, you know, from Luigi's Mansion and Shaggy.

02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:13.040
Okay.

02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:18.640
Before we get into that, Matt, I don't think you've seen it, but I have done Ghostbusters

02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:19.640
Luigi.

02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:24.320
It is called Boo Busters Luigi, proton pack jumpsuit.

02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:29.160
The pack here is a ghost from Super Mario Brothers and it glows in the dark.

02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:33.120
I will post photos on the OLR page for y'all to see it.

02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:34.120
I've seen it.

02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:35.120
I love them.

02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:36.120
All right.

02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:37.400
All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go.

02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:38.400
Take care.

02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:39.400
And thanks for the call tonight.

02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:40.400
No problem.

02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:41.400
Love you guys.

02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:42.400
Appreciate you all.

02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:43.400
See you on the flip side.

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:44.400
Hugs and kisses.

02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:45.400
Bye.

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:46.400
Cheesecake.

02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:47.400
Right.

02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:52.000
Good to hear from folks.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.120
Participate at orangesontraded.com to send us emails.

02:13:55.120 --> 02:14:02.680
Also in chat, this was posted like 30 minutes ago in chat, but I want to make sure I answer

02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:06.640
it because from our very own Bobby Black Wolf who said, so what are you looking forward

02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:11.600
to at SGDQ, which is coming up next week?

02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:13.240
I don't even know now.

02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:14.240
Next week.

02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:15.240
Next week.

02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:18.800
He's, I don't think it actually starts, starts until the same night as OLR.

02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:22.840
I don't remember if it starts that Sunday or if it actually doesn't start till Monday,

02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:27.420
but I'm looking forward to our very own Bobby Black Wolf doing more announcing, but this

02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:29.720
time live and in person.

02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:32.560
So that will be, he, I know he's doing.

02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:37.960
Yakuza like a dragon is the big one and I don't mean to say any speed run is bigger

02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:38.960
than others.

02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:43.620
However, Bobby is kind of an honorary part of the Yakuza speed run community at this

02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:46.040
point, I think, cause he's hosted a lot of them.

02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:47.800
So that'll be a fun one to see.

02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:51.360
Although I guess I can only really watch the beginning because I still haven't beat the

02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:52.360
game.

02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:56.240
And we know it will spoil the end, but I know he's hosting some other games as well.

02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:58.040
And so that'll be, that'll be fun.

02:14:58.040 --> 02:14:59.920
I don't know what, oh, go ahead.

02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:00.920
All right.

02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:04.960
Bobby says it starts Sunday at noon Eastern, um, respectfully, I have a lot of, of other

02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:06.560
things on my mind on Sunday.

02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:09.440
So if there's a run, I really have to see, at least they put everything on YouTube, but

02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:12.320
I'll watch later in the week for sure.

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:14.920
I was going to say, I don't know what this is, but it sounds awesome.

02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:19.800
Mega Man extreme versus Mega Man extreme two, a hundred percent extreme mode.

02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:21.520
Oh, that's Game Boy color.

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:22.520
Okay.

02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:26.880
Oh, looking forward to all the money that will be raised for a worthy cause.

02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:27.880
Yes.

02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:31.440
Is this the prevent cancer one or is this Doctors Without Borders?

02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:36.440
One of them is either one, you know, no, no, they're both worthy causes, but the winner

02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:38.720
one is always one charity and the summer one's always the other.

02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:39.720
Okay.

02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:40.720
Doctors Without Borders.

02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:44.760
Was it Final Fantasy six worlds collide randomizer.

02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:48.800
That sounds cool.

02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:50.200
I love the randomizers.

02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:51.200
I would love to watch that.

02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:53.680
I think the randomizer strategies are really interesting.

02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:57.040
So those, those, those are the things I look forward to.

02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:02.840
And um, off awful games or silly games or whatever they call it, the, the, the silly

02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:03.840
game block.

02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:04.840
Yeah.

02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:05.840
Yeah.

02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:06.840
Yeah.

02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:11.840
I saw, um, there was a McDonald's game that looked pretty funny.

02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:16.880
Um, I don't know.

02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:18.680
Super Mario maker two relay races.

02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:19.680
Those are always good.

02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:21.240
Kaiser, super Metroid.

02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:22.640
I want to see that.

02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:23.680
Oh God.

02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:25.720
That's going to be wild.

02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:28.600
And super hot VR, but that'd be pretty exciting to watch.

02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:32.240
And then they're going to do of course, Elden ring to cap it all off.

02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:33.240
You know what?

02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:37.340
I think y'all just need to watch the whole thing except a Sunday.

02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:40.760
You know, they're going to need Sunday to get warmed up.

02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:44.160
You know, it's the first one in person in a while, so let them get warmed up on Sunday

02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:48.200
and then Monday on YouTube and be in both.

02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:49.200
You could do both.

02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:52.960
You could, you could catch on how many channels I lurk in at one time.

02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:53.960
Yes.

02:16:53.960 --> 02:17:00.280
Um, all the ones I watch.

02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:01.280
It's not my fault.

02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:03.280
I'm there first.

02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:04.280
All right.

02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:07.720
I think with that, it's about time to wrap up the show as so that dark soccer can do

02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:12.360
her own stream and, uh, the rest of us can enjoy the rest of our weekend or what have

02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:13.360
you.

02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:17.880
Um, we'll be back in seven days to do it all again with the 20th anniversary show.

02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:23.160
If you can believe we haven't been canceled after all these years, uh, before we do that,

02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:25.120
we're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:28.840
Oh, I should say, of course, as I always do, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange

02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:32.340
Lawn Studio, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:34.600
but we need more voices to put out here on air.

02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:37.040
So, um, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:39.600
Tell somebody you don't like about the show because maybe they'll like it too.

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:44.200
A nice five star review, however you found this show, a nice five star review on a site

02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:47.920
like iTunes, Spotify, wherever you found this, uh, would go a long way as well.

02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:51.300
Uh, hosts on Twitch, followers on Twitch for VOG Network.

02:17:51.300 --> 02:17:52.300
We'll take it all.

02:17:52.420 --> 02:17:54.260
Um, thank you again so much for being here.

02:17:54.260 --> 02:17:55.660
I appreciate you all.

02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:58.180
Dark Sakura, your final thoughts tonight?

02:17:58.180 --> 02:18:03.820
My final thought is that I follow this person called, uh, Eddie who, um, on Twitter who

02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:12.300
does Dead by Daylight doujinshi and they are putting up for doujinshi right now and I am

02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:13.460
going to be able to get them.

02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:14.460
I'm very happy.

02:18:14.460 --> 02:18:15.460
Awesome.

02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:16.460
All right.

02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:17.820
Have a good post stream.

02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:18.820
We'll see you next time.

02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:19.820
Later taters.

02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:20.820
All right.

02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:23.340
And uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:25.700
I can't believe it's going to be 20 years next week.

02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:26.700
I know.

02:18:26.700 --> 02:18:27.700
Right?

02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:28.940
Like literally where did the time go?

02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:30.960
It's it's bonkers bananas.

02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:31.960
That's for sure.

02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:34.540
Uh, 20 years and no one still knows who we are.

02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:35.540
Yay.

02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:36.540
Yay.

02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:42.180
Uh, my final thought is, um, you know, I was expecting a lot more tech hiccups tonight

02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:43.180
and it did.

02:18:43.180 --> 02:18:47.020
We definitely had a couple, but overall I'm very pleased with this investment in the new

02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:52.900
computer and just the fact that having the nice fresh restart to clear out all the old

02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:57.700
drivers and everything like it's just, it's nice and everything's running so smoothly.

02:18:57.700 --> 02:19:01.280
I don't think we've missed hardly any frames tonight.

02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:05.780
It's been very lovely and uh, yeah, I'm looking forward to being encouraged to get back into

02:19:05.780 --> 02:19:06.900
streaming some more games.

02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:08.500
I definitely have a backlog myself.

02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:10.140
I do want to get into that.

02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:14.620
So thank you for bearing with me while I've been waiting to have a computer that's a little

02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:16.240
more capable of doing that.

02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:18.280
So I'm out of excuses now.

02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:20.240
Um, that's it.

02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:23.840
We'll see you in seven days to do this all again.

02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:28.040
Um, it's a pretty big week and I hope, I hope some blasts in the past will show up.

02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:29.040
I hope you will show up.

02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:30.320
Thank you so much for being here.

02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:32.280
Um, have a great week everybody.

02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:33.280
Bye.

02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:38.160
