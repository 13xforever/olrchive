00:00.000 --> 00:14.240
20 years ago, the news reported on a scary arcade game that featured booty booty booty

00:14.240 --> 00:18.120
bass music. A few songs on which featured backgrounds with animations showing syringes

00:18.120 --> 00:23.020
and pills, including a sexy nurse, but also the word medicine overlaid multiple times.

00:23.020 --> 00:27.640
The news was negative. Geeks were outraged. 20 years later, most of the world has been

00:27.640 --> 00:34.680
stuck with syringes multiple times, some also taking a pill in addition. The irony hurts.

00:34.680 --> 00:38.600
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to continue reminiscing

00:38.600 --> 00:44.160
and bring you gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:44.160 --> 00:54.200
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back once again and again and

00:54.200 --> 01:00.460
again to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio

01:00.460 --> 01:09.360
live once again for tonight, June the 26th of 2022, episode number 920 of our show. And

01:09.360 --> 01:16.500
as you might've heard the week that we have turned 20 years old as a show, a show that

01:16.500 --> 01:24.980
dated back to our very first episode, June 23rd of 2002, when as Jason referenced there

01:24.980 --> 01:30.500
in the intro, we were talking about controversy in the Dance Dance Revolution scene from,

01:30.500 --> 01:36.140
oh my gosh, syringes and pills being shown in a background video. Who could imagine it?

01:36.140 --> 01:40.460
And here we are 20 years later and syringes and pills, no big deal. That's commonplace

01:40.460 --> 01:46.140
during the pandemic. By we, I mean, of course, myself, Rob Roberts joined as always by my

01:46.180 --> 01:50.540
co-hosts. Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:50.540 --> 01:53.180
Hey, what's up? I'm wearing the shirt.

01:53.180 --> 01:57.780
Or as you've been known to say on the show for a very long time, what's up bitches?

01:57.780 --> 01:59.420
What's up bitches?

01:59.420 --> 02:03.740
You kind of made that, you kind of made that little motion tonight. What's up bitches?

02:03.740 --> 02:06.020
With your OL army shirt, which I love.

02:06.020 --> 02:10.300
I think I got this maybe after our third year.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.180
Yeah, you've had it a while.

02:12.940 --> 02:19.820
Kristen and I went to a trip to San Francisco and we had shirts made.

02:19.820 --> 02:20.660
I love it.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.900
I'll show you the back of it.

02:22.900 --> 02:27.540
And on the back for those on the podcast feed, it says Dark Sakura with the number zero on the back.

02:27.540 --> 02:28.020
Yep.

02:28.020 --> 02:32.860
What number would I be on the team? If you're zero, which one am I?

02:32.860 --> 02:33.900
0.69.

02:33.900 --> 02:38.940
0.69, I'll take it. And then of course, of course, I have to ask the one and only

02:38.940 --> 02:40.820
tech master, Loki.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.220
Which number he would be. Hi, Loki.

02:43.220 --> 02:46.500
I don't know.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.740
Loki would be R.

02:48.740 --> 02:50.940
The number R.

02:50.940 --> 02:52.740
How about I would say 20.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.380
Do you know why I would say 20?

02:55.380 --> 02:59.420
Because that was the episode number when Dark Sakura and I were like, you know what?

02:59.420 --> 03:01.020
Loki's been here every single week.

03:01.020 --> 03:04.540
We're just retconning him as a full host for the whole thing.

03:04.540 --> 03:07.900
So that was that was episode 20 because, you know, OK, so I'm going to go back.

03:07.900 --> 03:14.220
Let's go back to the back down memory lane, because we're going to be doing that a little bit tonight as we look back on 20 years of the show.

03:14.220 --> 03:31.420
Is that way back on the very first episode of OLR, which, by the way, for those of you that listen here at VOG Network, because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, Twitch.TV slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:31.420 --> 03:35.020
Bobby wasn't on tonight, but I'll come back to that in a minute.

03:35.020 --> 03:47.940
But anyway, we said a long time ago on this show, originally it was just Dark Sakura and I were going to start this show because we were on another show that was on for a long time, over 10 years, called Undersedation Live.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.540
Dark Sakura was a guest host, but it was kind of like Loki.

03:50.540 --> 03:51.700
She was there like all the time.

03:52.060 --> 03:52.540
So.

03:53.620 --> 03:55.540
Going in for for Jessica.

03:55.540 --> 03:56.300
Yeah, a lot.

03:56.340 --> 03:56.740
Yeah.

03:56.740 --> 03:57.220
Yeah.

03:57.380 --> 03:57.700
Yeah.

03:57.700 --> 04:01.260
So so anyway, it was originally Dark Sakura and I.

04:01.260 --> 04:14.700
But then the original vision of Orange Lounge Radio, and I've said this a lot, a lot, is that we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at the arcade, and then we would go from the arcade to the little cafe that was in front of Rose Hill Golf Land.

04:14.820 --> 04:23.700
And we would eat mozzarella sticks to just put back those calories we just lost playing DDR and talk a little smack about video games, but in a fun way, because we love video games.

04:24.420 --> 04:31.340
And the original episodes of OLR, we're trying to kind of like invoke that same thing where we would have everybody over at the house.

04:31.340 --> 04:33.780
We invited like a lot of DDR people over it.

04:33.780 --> 04:51.380
Like if you go back and listen to the first episode of Orange Lounge Radio, which you can do at VOG Network, because last year for the 19th anniversary, we did a special show where we all listened and reacted to episode one, which is which and I think we all kind of walked away going, that wasn't as bad as we thought it would be.

04:52.780 --> 04:53.380
So that was fun.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.020
So that is in the archives over at VOG Network for subscribers.

04:57.140 --> 04:59.020
So what were you gonna say, Jayden?

04:59.900 --> 05:02.940
I said, no, it was a it was pretty decent, actually.

05:02.940 --> 05:07.180
It wasn't as bad as cringe as I expected it to be.

05:07.300 --> 05:07.940
It wasn't.

05:07.940 --> 05:08.700
It really wasn't.

05:09.860 --> 05:13.900
And first off, because, you know, we do like to say we're the show where every gamer has a voice.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.300
I know the situation with the pandemic.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.340
We're doing this virtually now.

05:18.700 --> 05:22.180
And it's just kind of now we've been used to doing it this way for so long.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.900
We kind of don't really get together in the same room anymore.

05:25.140 --> 05:31.540
But I'm so thankful that all of you in chat are here to share these weeks with us, whether you're

05:31.540 --> 05:35.300
here every single week, like Dark Tetsuya, I'm just going to I'm going to name names.

05:35.740 --> 05:40.820
Dark Tetsuya has been here pretty much every single week since the very first episode.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.460
He may have missed an episode here or there, but so is Dark Sakura.

05:43.460 --> 05:44.100
So is Loki.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.340
So so have I.

05:45.860 --> 05:47.700
There was there were a couple of shows I wasn't even at.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.780
So like, you know, we all missed a show here and there.

05:49.820 --> 05:51.980
Dark Tetsuya has been there since the very beginning as well.

05:52.180 --> 05:52.980
In our chat room.

05:52.980 --> 05:58.700
So whether you're Dark Tetsuya or anybody else, if you're just I'm seeing so many names I haven't seen

05:58.700 --> 06:01.140
in years tonight in chat.

06:01.140 --> 06:05.100
So I just I really want to say thank you and show the love back.

06:05.100 --> 06:09.780
And also I am just blown away.

06:09.780 --> 06:11.540
I don't even know the word vocabulary.

06:11.540 --> 06:12.820
I failed tonight.

06:13.020 --> 06:18.020
One of my co-hosts has to help me is that you all are so generous.

06:18.020 --> 06:23.260
Like we had a hype train level five before the show even went live.

06:24.220 --> 06:25.620
And that's huge.

06:25.780 --> 06:28.980
And I will I will read all your names and acknowledge you after the show.

06:28.980 --> 06:33.660
For those that haven't been here in a while, because we're doing this on Twitch TV, we don't you really do it

06:33.660 --> 06:36.340
like other Twitch channels because we're recording our podcast.

06:36.540 --> 06:41.740
So we don't like to do that awkward stop every time someone donates and say, hey, Dark Sakura, thanks for the sub.

06:41.900 --> 06:42.940
But we will acknowledge.

06:42.940 --> 06:44.660
Please, please know we see you.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.780
It's I'm looking at some of these bitty totals.

06:47.820 --> 06:51.700
This is astounding. People are donating like a thousand bits, twenty seven hundred bits at a time.

06:52.540 --> 07:00.580
The hype train, twenty four gifts and sorry, twenty four subs and six thousand four hundred and thirty bits.

07:00.580 --> 07:04.900
That's screenshotted at four hundred and four percent huge.

07:05.100 --> 07:08.820
I'm just like I I'm not going to cry tonight because I said I'm not going to fucking do it.

07:09.380 --> 07:14.300
Do it. But your your generosity is amazing.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.740
And thank you. You really have been the motivation to be here.

07:18.140 --> 07:24.660
Throughout the shitty pandemic and everything else going on in the world, which I do need to call this out.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.220
We are a video game podcast.

07:26.220 --> 07:30.860
We talk about gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, but and we're celebrating tonight.

07:30.860 --> 07:32.260
This is a huge celebration.

07:32.340 --> 07:41.380
No other live Internet show that's weekly that we know of has gotten to 20 years, at least in the video game world.

07:41.380 --> 07:42.660
Maybe some tech shows out there.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.020
I just I can't follow everything.

07:44.180 --> 07:48.100
But in the video game world, there's no like weekly Internet show that's gotten to 20 years.

07:48.980 --> 07:50.740
So this is this is really historic.

07:50.740 --> 07:55.580
And I'm saying that with all humility and humbleness that this is it's because of you guys.

07:55.580 --> 07:57.540
And it's really that drive there.

07:58.620 --> 07:59.740
And we're celebrating tonight.

07:59.740 --> 08:04.540
But we is a night to do some horn tooting.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.020
Yeah. Yeah, I know it is.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.860
It is. But I'm going to be honest.

08:07.860 --> 08:09.980
And you all know, I don't shy away from these topics.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.500
We have a platform, even though it is a small platform.

08:13.500 --> 08:21.980
And I need to use this platform to say what happened in this country on Friday from the Supreme Court is fucking bullshit.

08:21.980 --> 08:25.380
And you can bold that, underline it, italicize it.

08:25.780 --> 08:30.260
And although, yes, we're celebrating tonight and that's a huge part of what's in our hearts.

08:30.860 --> 08:33.900
There's also a big part of our hearts that is very sad.

08:34.220 --> 08:40.580
I am I am so sad for the women and people with uteruses in this country that are affected by this decision.

08:40.580 --> 08:50.500
And you know what? We're all affected by this decision because we all have a wife or a sister or a niece or a cousin or a daughter or a mother, et cetera, et cetera.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.540
We all have someone that is affected by this.

08:53.540 --> 08:56.540
And I'm going to say this very bluntly.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.300
If you haven't had an abortion, you know someone who has.

09:03.340 --> 09:06.740
And this affects everything.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.620
And yes, I am well aware.

09:08.660 --> 09:14.660
Thank you for the five thousand messages directed at me that said they're coming for you next.

09:14.900 --> 09:19.420
I'm well aware they're coming for all of us.

09:19.620 --> 09:21.780
Clarence Thomas said it himself already.

09:22.540 --> 09:29.260
Of course, you want to know who is also responsible for getting Clarence Thomas instated as a justice?

09:30.180 --> 09:31.060
Our president.

09:31.180 --> 09:33.140
Yeah, believe Anita Hill.

09:34.140 --> 09:34.500
Yeah.

09:35.660 --> 09:48.540
Anyway, I do want to try to keep the mood celebratory on our show, but it would be irresponsible of us to not say something about that situation and acknowledge that it's some bullshit.

09:48.860 --> 09:51.620
There are a lot of funds out there that you can donate to.

09:51.860 --> 09:55.620
The number one thing you can do is make noise and talk to people.

09:56.220 --> 10:04.020
You have to remember there's another side of this argument that uses the imagery of dead babies to try to control people.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.220
And that's what it is.

10:05.220 --> 10:06.580
This is about control.

10:06.820 --> 10:22.220
And when people don't even know science, when people say dead babies, that's what they're trying to do is use that horrific imagery to control you and ask anyone who understands what this argument is really about.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.180
It is not about dead babies.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.300
And I'm just going to leave it at that.

10:26.340 --> 10:31.620
Like when you when you say that, you just tell me that you're only listening to shock imagery.

10:31.940 --> 10:32.300
I'm sorry.

10:33.300 --> 10:38.580
As the person on this podcast who owns a uterus, I would like to make a comment, please.

10:40.380 --> 10:42.180
I'm going to go into a little bit of science on here.

10:42.900 --> 10:46.980
Number one, there is not a heartbeat when people are saying their heartbeat.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.100
It's electrical pulses.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.460
There's no heart formed to beat.

10:51.260 --> 11:03.620
Number two, an abortion provided during the first trimester typically is when the fetus is not large enough to require being physically pulled out of the body like they like they claim happen.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.660
Most abortions happen during the first trimester.

11:06.860 --> 11:13.740
One is given a pill, one passes the fetus and it hurts and it's terrible.

11:14.420 --> 11:18.860
It is a pain that has it's pretty much on par.

11:19.460 --> 11:29.500
Well, maybe not as bad as actual childbirth, but on par with the same pressures the body goes through, not to mention the hormonal imbalances after the fact.

11:30.580 --> 11:41.620
And then on top of that, you know, say that you're somebody who is who's wanted this child, has carried it, and then you find out that the pregnancy isn't viable, that it could kill you.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.220
And you have to make that decision.

11:44.620 --> 12:13.180
People who have to make that, they're basically condemning many people to death over their religious opinion, which, first of all, bless the satanic temple, I'm sorry, the satanic temple for doing the right work, for going in guns blazing and calling out the religious violation.

12:13.540 --> 12:18.500
And personal violations that this is doing, I love them to bits, I support them in what they do.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.340
And you say this as a proud Jewish person.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.860
I'm also a card carrying Satanist.

12:24.100 --> 12:24.980
Yeah, no, I get it.

12:24.980 --> 12:25.380
I get it.

12:25.380 --> 12:25.740
Yeah.

12:27.740 --> 12:30.820
Well, on top of that, they were actually formed by a Jewish person, just FYI.

12:31.220 --> 12:44.980
Anyway, I want to say that every last one of you owes it to yourself to number one, educate yourself on what actually happens in an abortion.

12:46.100 --> 12:57.900
Number two, also educate yourself on what happens during childbirth and what a uterus possessing person goes through.

12:58.660 --> 13:18.700
On top of that, it's going to make it even harder for lower income women to, I'm going to say women generically in this sense, you know, to go seek out health care for things like endometriosis, which is already a bitch to get diagnosed.

13:19.100 --> 13:29.660
I've had several friends not get their endo, what's the word I'm thinking of, diagnosis until they, you know, like eight, 10 years later.

13:29.660 --> 13:34.220
And by that time they can't get pregnant because of the damage done to their bodies.

13:35.100 --> 13:39.660
It's going to make it harder for people who wish to get sterilized to be sterilized.

13:40.300 --> 13:45.580
I was lucky enough that I basically stood my ground when they tried to talk me out of it.

13:45.580 --> 13:47.420
I'm like, it's my body.

13:47.420 --> 13:48.860
I want the shit out.

13:48.860 --> 13:50.140
And we live in California.

13:50.940 --> 13:51.440
Yes.

13:52.540 --> 14:02.380
It's this value that's only placed on women that your value is as an incubator.

14:03.340 --> 14:06.540
And then we're going to go ahead and actually look at the other half of this.

14:07.820 --> 14:10.700
What are they going to do when the child is born?

14:11.660 --> 14:14.300
They're not going to want to support education.

14:14.300 --> 14:18.780
They're not going to want to support the social programs that will help the majority

14:18.780 --> 14:21.580
of low-income families support said children.

14:22.300 --> 14:25.020
They're not going to want to provide them a college education.

14:25.020 --> 14:30.540
And I'll tell you a big thing about that is, and this is why, I mean, if you look back in history,

14:30.540 --> 14:38.700
why in some cases it was illegal for the, the quote lower class to seek an education,

14:38.700 --> 14:43.660
because an educated population will make an educated decision.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.460
Especially when it comes time to vote.

14:48.060 --> 14:52.380
I think this is how they hold onto their power.

14:53.180 --> 14:55.660
And we have to take that power back.

14:56.540 --> 14:59.740
We need to get away from Republican and Democrat.

15:01.020 --> 15:02.940
It's time to do something different.

15:02.940 --> 15:08.060
The definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

15:09.020 --> 15:13.660
And right now, and I say this with all the respect to our allies,

15:15.180 --> 15:24.540
but if you do not have a uterus and you are trying to claim some of this stuff as fact,

15:24.540 --> 15:31.980
when you are incorrect, when your religion has no place in science or government, I don't care.

15:31.980 --> 15:32.780
Shut the fuck up.

15:33.180 --> 15:36.620
Go educate yourself and then come back with an opinion.

15:36.620 --> 15:38.460
And then maybe we'll have a discussion.

15:40.460 --> 15:44.940
And just, just to, to, on a note to end on with this, is that like,

15:44.940 --> 15:49.900
I think the thing that pees me the most about this is that the people that are trying to shut

15:49.900 --> 15:55.660
this down and you know it, you watch enough news, you see the people trying to shut this down and

15:56.460 --> 16:04.780
you know it either have had or have been the reason for, in most cases, an abortion.

16:04.780 --> 16:05.980
You know it.

16:07.260 --> 16:08.620
You know that to be true.

16:08.620 --> 16:13.660
And it's, it's this hypocrisy that is the most dangerous and deadly thing that

16:13.660 --> 16:15.260
continues to go on in this country.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.140
So look at that.

16:18.140 --> 16:18.620
Oh, go ahead.

16:19.180 --> 16:21.100
I'm even going to go beyond that.

16:21.180 --> 16:28.300
And I'm going to say it's not just, we have the people in power providing their line,

16:28.300 --> 16:30.460
even whether or not they actually believe it.

16:30.460 --> 16:32.300
I'm going to, I'm going to throw that out there.

16:32.300 --> 16:38.620
That is the hypocrisy behind it is that any of these rich politicians or anyone in the higher

16:38.620 --> 16:43.820
brackets of income will still be able to go somewhere and get an abortion.

16:43.820 --> 16:47.340
It's going to affect anyone, middle-class and lower income.

16:48.300 --> 16:58.540
But the other half of this equation is the willful ignorance of the general population,

16:58.540 --> 17:02.140
the people who believe them with this cult-like mentality.

17:02.140 --> 17:09.980
And the moment that you try to introduce an idea that is contrary, and I'm actually thinking

17:09.980 --> 17:16.060
of my mother when I say this, that is contrary to their internalized belief system.

17:17.820 --> 17:23.340
They react like, like they're having some sort of mental breakdown.

17:23.340 --> 17:27.020
That's the only way I can describe it that they become angry.

17:27.020 --> 17:28.060
They become violent.

17:28.060 --> 17:34.060
It's almost like, like this grieving, like they're starting to go into the denial part

17:34.060 --> 17:38.220
of the, of the grieving process because a part of their belief is being attacked and

17:38.220 --> 17:39.580
might die, you know?

17:39.580 --> 17:53.260
And it has to be that we need to find a way to introduce education in so undeniable and

17:53.260 --> 17:59.580
digestible of a way that they have no choice but to learn the truth.

18:01.740 --> 18:07.820
And that's, we have a handful of people with archaic ideas that don't reflect the majority

18:07.820 --> 18:12.540
of people in this country creating the decisions for the people in this country.

18:14.540 --> 18:20.460
Anyway, we've just spent multiple minutes at the top of what is supposed to be our biggest

18:20.460 --> 18:23.580
episode ever talking about this issue.

18:23.580 --> 18:26.940
And I think this should show how serious it is, I would think.

18:26.940 --> 18:32.140
So with that, we will put the soapbox back behind the curtain for the moment.

18:33.660 --> 18:36.700
Anyhow, I do want to, of course, say hello to those of you that are in our chat room

18:36.780 --> 18:42.620
over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where you're getting, or, you know, we're getting

18:42.620 --> 18:48.700
a lot of cheers and support in chat for the soapbox that we are currently standing on.

18:49.340 --> 18:51.500
But I do want to point out some of the other comments in chat.

18:52.300 --> 18:56.540
Let's see, Pod Culture talking about the celebration and all that earlier says,

18:57.180 --> 19:01.820
you will have to do it in person next year since the show will be old enough to drink.

19:01.820 --> 19:05.260
You know, we would have loved to have done an in-person show this year.

19:05.260 --> 19:12.140
I think the, just the, still the big question mark around the pandemic and everything has

19:12.140 --> 19:14.140
made it difficult to plan.

19:14.140 --> 19:18.060
I think it would have been very frustrating if we had tried to plan an in-person something

19:18.060 --> 19:19.980
and then here comes an outbreak.

19:19.980 --> 19:24.700
I mean, just earlier today I was playing, is it allergies or is it COVID?

19:24.700 --> 19:26.620
Because I'm feeling a little bit eh.

19:26.620 --> 19:32.060
Now I took a test and it appears the answer is it's allergies, but you just can't be

19:32.060 --> 19:32.940
too sure right now.

19:32.940 --> 19:37.180
It's a little wild.

19:37.900 --> 19:38.940
Like you're playing the game.

19:38.940 --> 19:40.140
What's the sniffle?

19:40.140 --> 19:41.900
Yeah, exactly.

19:41.900 --> 19:44.060
It's like, what was the game show?

19:44.060 --> 19:45.900
Let's see what's behind door number one.

19:45.900 --> 19:46.300
Exactly.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.340
Is it COVID?

19:47.340 --> 19:49.820
Door number two is the sinus infection.

19:49.820 --> 19:52.620
Door number three, meningitis outbreak in Florida.

19:52.620 --> 19:55.260
Like just the hilarity goes on these days.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.460
Is it monkey pox?

19:56.460 --> 19:57.740
That one was floating too.

19:57.740 --> 19:58.700
I know, I know.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.460
And then let's see, look at your treatment.

20:00.460 --> 20:04.220
You choose box number two, nothing.

20:04.220 --> 20:06.700
You get absolutely nothing.

20:06.700 --> 20:11.340
You so stupid to quote UHF on Wheel of Fish.

20:13.260 --> 20:13.740
Let's see.

20:13.740 --> 20:22.620
Going back to our chat, let's see other comments that had or said, Rama said, OLR next year

20:22.620 --> 20:23.900
can officially drink.

20:23.900 --> 20:24.620
Yes.

20:24.620 --> 20:30.460
Tyre Con chat says, OLR has been around long before podcasts existed.

20:31.420 --> 20:33.100
Yeah, in a way, yeah.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.980
And again, I don't know.

20:35.980 --> 20:42.620
Long is a relative term, but podcasting, I know the first OLR to go edition was in like

20:42.620 --> 20:45.420
December of 2004, January 2005.

20:45.420 --> 20:46.460
It was early.

20:46.460 --> 20:47.500
It was very early.

20:48.540 --> 20:52.620
And I want to say podcasting kind of started probably around 2004.

20:52.620 --> 20:56.300
It probably started the year before we jumped on with our to go edition.

20:56.300 --> 21:00.620
Because the history is, yes, we were a live show on live 365.

21:00.620 --> 21:03.340
Then as soon as podcasting was a thing, we jumped on that.

21:03.340 --> 21:08.540
And then we kind of like merged the two shows together because when we were talking mostly

21:08.540 --> 21:13.820
about music games on the live show, the music game scene kind of went through a drought.

21:13.820 --> 21:17.580
And then we merged the shows and like not even six months later, Guitar Hero came out

21:17.580 --> 21:20.620
and started a big resurgence of music games, but it's fine.

21:20.620 --> 21:21.660
At my house.

21:21.660 --> 21:25.260
Yeah, I love where the show has gone since then.

21:25.260 --> 21:26.300
So there is that.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.020
Oh, I love this.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.420
Fanara in chat.

21:29.420 --> 21:29.980
I love this.

21:30.620 --> 21:34.300
Says OLR lasted five times longer than the Confederacy.

21:35.740 --> 21:36.940
Yes, it has.

21:36.940 --> 21:37.820
Yes, it has.

21:39.580 --> 21:40.300
Amen to that.

21:41.180 --> 21:42.300
Loki, I didn't even tie.

21:42.300 --> 21:46.540
And so speaking of things from OLR's history, I usually ask what's playing behind you on

21:46.540 --> 21:47.100
Twitch.

21:47.100 --> 21:48.860
What is playing behind you on Twitch tonight?

21:49.580 --> 21:54.060
It is a video they posted on the Orange Lounge Radio channel.

21:55.100 --> 22:00.140
I don't know how long ago, 15 years ago, it was probably the last time our YouTube was

22:00.140 --> 22:00.780
actually updated.

22:00.780 --> 22:03.900
It's it's it's the historical press.

22:03.900 --> 22:09.020
It's the historical preservation of the Grand Theft Auto modded death match games I used

22:09.020 --> 22:09.500
to play.

22:10.540 --> 22:15.980
Oh, God, years ago, you know, some of the best gaming moments ever.

22:16.700 --> 22:17.340
It's a good video.

22:17.980 --> 22:22.140
Unfortunately, unfortunately, they had patched that stuff out long ago.

22:22.140 --> 22:29.100
But, you know, being experienced or being exposed to that for so long, maybe an even

22:29.100 --> 22:32.540
better Grand Theft Auto player, because it's like, OK, well, you know, here we've been

22:32.540 --> 22:35.980
playing with like nukes and just like rapid fire grenade launchers and stuff.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.940
Now we have to contend with a shotgun.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.300
I think I can handle that.

22:40.300 --> 22:43.740
And so but it was a lot of fun.

22:43.740 --> 22:47.900
If you want to see some OLR blasts from the past, like when we were on the news a couple

22:47.900 --> 22:55.020
times, when we have some random ass E3 videos, Loki's video he's talking about now, Loki

22:55.020 --> 22:56.780
drunk playing Mario Kart.

22:56.780 --> 22:59.660
If you want to see all that, like check out the OLR YouTube channel.

22:59.660 --> 23:00.940
It's just Orange Lounge Radio on YouTube.

23:00.940 --> 23:02.700
You can see a lot of crazy shit there.

23:02.700 --> 23:03.100
It's it's pretty rough.

23:03.100 --> 23:05.020
I'm pulling something out of this bag.

23:05.020 --> 23:05.260
All right.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.460
Can I get a comment from chat?

23:07.660 --> 23:09.420
Oh, that's when we were in the paper.

23:09.420 --> 23:10.620
That is the old.

23:10.620 --> 23:12.140
Is that the old place Loki and I lived at?

23:12.140 --> 23:12.780
Yeah, it is.

23:12.780 --> 23:13.340
Yes, it is.

23:13.340 --> 23:14.380
So wild.

23:14.380 --> 23:15.180
That is so wild.

23:15.180 --> 23:15.500
Yep.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.020
That's nice standing up there.

23:17.740 --> 23:20.300
I didn't laminate mine, so mine kind of fell apart.

23:20.300 --> 23:22.620
And this isn't really laminated.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.460
It did yellow out a little bit.

23:24.460 --> 23:30.140
I just had this like binder thing that I kept it in forever and it never.

23:32.300 --> 23:32.860
Look at that.

23:32.860 --> 23:33.500
I think that's.

23:34.460 --> 23:35.660
Oh, that's is that Travis?

23:36.700 --> 23:38.060
No, that's somebody else.

23:38.060 --> 23:38.780
I think it's somebody else.

23:38.780 --> 23:41.740
Yeah, that's some dude that there's a guy.

23:41.740 --> 23:44.940
Like, was it about bicycling or something like that?

23:44.940 --> 23:50.060
So the caption on here, Orange Lounge Radio Dance Dance Revolution is a video game in

23:50.060 --> 23:52.860
which players dance on the touch pad to the beat of the music.

23:52.860 --> 24:00.860
Orange Lounge Radio podcast dance music and commentary by podcast creators Matt, Rob and

24:00.860 --> 24:01.100
me.

24:01.660 --> 24:02.380
Oh, my gosh.

24:02.380 --> 24:05.100
It had my unmarried name.

24:05.740 --> 24:06.220
Oh, wow.

24:08.220 --> 24:11.180
I had to literally stop and think about what that name is.

24:11.180 --> 24:11.740
But anyway.

24:12.860 --> 24:16.460
Well, you remember I used to get Jessica's former fiance's mail.

24:16.460 --> 24:16.940
No, I know.

24:16.940 --> 24:17.260
I know.

24:18.140 --> 24:21.500
I want to get this comment from chat because I think this is from a blast from the past

24:21.500 --> 24:24.060
listener KevBZ3 in our chat.

24:24.060 --> 24:27.900
If I'm not mistaking, that is the artist formerly known as DDR Kevin.

24:27.900 --> 24:33.020
So hello and great to see you tonight in chat says it's pretty interesting how the whole

24:33.020 --> 24:40.060
live to podcast to live trend kind of played out over the last 20 years with the advancement

24:40.060 --> 24:42.300
of various platforms over the time span.

24:43.260 --> 24:46.460
This is so true, Bestie, as the kids would say today.

24:47.260 --> 24:53.100
It is fascinating how that live to podcast to live because you may or may not recall

24:53.100 --> 24:55.020
there was a year or two.

24:55.020 --> 24:56.860
It was around the time Final Fantasy 13 was new.

24:56.860 --> 25:01.900
It was probably 2006, 2007 when we were broadcasting this show on Justin TV.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.980
And it wasn't really a blip.

25:04.620 --> 25:09.500
And Bobby had his Friday night gaming show, and he was being told who wants to watch other

25:09.500 --> 25:11.900
people play video games while you do a podcast.

25:11.900 --> 25:14.940
And it isn't that fascinating that now it's the norm.

25:14.940 --> 25:19.980
I'm not trying to like toot our own horn about being like ahead of the curve or whatever,

25:19.980 --> 25:24.060
maybe a little bit, but it does go to show you that generally because I bet we weren't

25:24.060 --> 25:26.700
the only only people in the entire universe either.

25:26.700 --> 25:29.740
You know, many people mentioned they found us through all games, and there were a lot

25:29.740 --> 25:32.940
of people on that network back in the day who are doing very similar things.

25:32.940 --> 25:37.500
So this was a path we forged as indie creators.

25:37.500 --> 25:43.980
So the indie folks really were the trendsetters here, and it wasn't until IGN or whatever

25:43.980 --> 25:46.380
started doing it that it got really cool, I guess.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.140
So there's that.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.620
But yeah, it's wild.

25:50.620 --> 25:53.500
I have other questions that we get asked a lot.

25:53.500 --> 25:57.020
I'm going to get to in a moment, but I have a couple other things I need to get to first.

25:57.020 --> 25:58.620
I have a lot of announcements and things tonight.

25:58.620 --> 26:03.980
OK, so number one, I mentioned that Bobby Black Wolf was not here tonight.

26:03.980 --> 26:07.020
However, Bobby has sent us a special message.

26:07.100 --> 26:10.860
I'm going to apologize to my co-host because the way this show is wired, you're not going

26:10.860 --> 26:14.300
to be able to hear this as the audience does, but I'll recap here at the end.

26:14.300 --> 26:15.020
So I apologize.

26:15.020 --> 26:19.420
So let's go to a special pre-taped message from our pal Bobby Black Wolf.

26:19.420 --> 26:20.540
Hello, OLR.

26:20.540 --> 26:22.060
It's Bobby Black Wolf.

26:22.060 --> 26:25.740
Sorry I couldn't be there live tonight on your 20th anniversary.

26:25.740 --> 26:26.780
I really wanted to be there.

26:26.780 --> 26:32.940
I really wanted to be in Sacramento, but instead I'm in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bloomington,

26:32.940 --> 26:36.220
actually, for Summer Games Done Quick 2022.

26:36.220 --> 26:40.300
I am hosting Summer Games Done Quick this year.

26:40.300 --> 26:44.860
I'm going to be hosting early Monday morning as well as Tuesday afternoon.

26:44.860 --> 26:47.580
Check gamesdonequick.com for the schedule for that.

26:47.580 --> 26:50.940
But I wanted to make something and even show you a little bit of what Games Done Quick

26:50.940 --> 26:55.580
looks like when you're not looking at it from their official Twitch stream.

26:55.580 --> 26:56.860
That's what I'm running here.

26:56.860 --> 27:00.700
I'm going to be taking more videos during the week, and I should be back next week so

27:00.700 --> 27:02.380
I can delay OLR's start.

27:02.380 --> 27:03.660
But happy birthday, OLR.

27:03.660 --> 27:05.100
I did not delay your start tonight.

27:05.100 --> 27:08.860
You were able to start on time for your 20th anniversary.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.100
Thank you so much for being a friend to me.

27:11.660 --> 27:17.900
And y'all are the reason that I'm still doing this and probably why I'm here at SGDQ.

27:17.900 --> 27:23.420
It's because I continued doing the podcast with y'all and being your lead-in, being

27:23.420 --> 27:27.420
your opening band for the past 15, 16 years.

27:27.420 --> 27:30.060
And hopefully we'll be doing it for much longer.

27:30.060 --> 27:31.180
So thank you, OLR.

27:31.180 --> 27:34.620
Congratulations on 20 years on the air.

27:35.420 --> 27:36.780
Well, thank you so much for that, Bobby.

27:36.780 --> 27:37.580
Appreciate it.

27:37.580 --> 27:40.780
And you know we don't consider you an opening act.

27:40.780 --> 27:43.020
We consider you a co-headliner.

27:43.020 --> 27:46.460
So congratulations on going back to Summer Games Done Quick.

27:46.460 --> 27:49.260
I know you guys couldn't hear the audio, but you could probably see the video.

27:49.260 --> 27:52.700
And obviously he's showing a little bit of what Summer Games looks like when it's not

27:52.700 --> 27:54.940
on Twitch, like what it actually looks like there in person.

27:54.940 --> 27:59.100
And boy, you can see the precautions they're taking this year.

27:59.100 --> 28:00.860
Like everything is spaced out.

28:01.100 --> 28:04.060
That arcade, that was wild.

28:04.060 --> 28:06.860
But I mean, I'm glad they're taking it seriously.

28:06.860 --> 28:11.180
And I'm glad they're allowing people that are even, because my understanding is there's

28:11.180 --> 28:15.500
quite a few immunocompromised people that are either involved with Games Done Quick

28:15.500 --> 28:18.860
or are speedrunners or a variety of those things.

28:18.860 --> 28:23.500
So it's really great that while there's a lot of people that are just like, eh, COVID's

28:23.500 --> 28:27.020
done with, it's really great that they are still like going above and beyond and taking

28:27.020 --> 28:27.820
those precautions.

28:27.900 --> 28:31.100
And it's how nice to have something like that back.

28:31.100 --> 28:36.140
So Bobby will definitely be watching, not just when you are doing donations, but I'm

28:36.140 --> 28:37.980
sure throughout the week as well.

28:37.980 --> 28:39.420
That'll be really cool.

28:39.420 --> 28:42.060
So thank you for that message.

28:42.060 --> 28:42.940
Really appreciate that.

28:43.580 --> 28:46.940
OK, I have another kind of special-ish announcement.

28:47.660 --> 28:54.940
And the interesting thing about this is that it is actually nothing that myself, Dark Sakura,

28:54.940 --> 28:55.820
or Loki did.

28:56.060 --> 29:01.500
So it's a special little treat for Orange Lounge Radio's 20th anniversary.

29:01.500 --> 29:05.020
And this is something that Dark Tetsuya actually put together.

29:05.020 --> 29:06.860
I think he had a lot of help with this.

29:06.860 --> 29:12.140
I don't know all of the people that helped with this, but it is a new website.

29:12.140 --> 29:17.820
And if you want to get to this website, it's bit.ly.

29:18.780 --> 29:29.180
So that traditional URL shortener, bit.ly slash o-l-r-cive and the number two, because

29:29.180 --> 29:34.380
o-l-r-cive one was gone, the skydrive or whatever folded.

29:34.380 --> 29:42.380
So o-l-r-cive two is a new archive of Blast from the Past of the show.

29:42.380 --> 29:45.900
If you want to go back and listen to episode one, you can do that.

29:45.900 --> 29:46.540
It's here for you.

29:46.780 --> 29:48.140
In fact, he actually even broke it up into seasons.

29:48.140 --> 29:53.260
I believe this is just about every single live episode of the show we ever did is here.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.260
And I'll come back to this in a minute because there's another exciting thing here too.

29:57.260 --> 30:02.700
And then even some of the specials, I didn't even remember we did a Christmas special in

30:02.700 --> 30:03.580
2007.

30:04.140 --> 30:08.140
There was the roast to Travis and whatever.

30:08.140 --> 30:13.980
The best April Fool's joke we ever did, the giggling lesbian gaming show is here.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.020
You can get all of it.

30:15.100 --> 30:16.460
It's all on the o-l-r-cive.

30:17.260 --> 30:21.180
I am going to give the usual disclaimer that I give when it comes to Orange Launch Radio

30:21.180 --> 30:21.660
old shit.

30:22.380 --> 30:30.220
This is a 20 year old show and the humor and the jokes and the catch phrases that we may

30:30.220 --> 30:35.580
have said back in 2002 would not necessarily be things we would say today.

30:35.580 --> 30:39.580
I hope you all know that, but you and I both know that there are haters out there in the

30:39.580 --> 30:43.660
world that would love nothing more than to crawl through these archives and look for

30:43.660 --> 30:50.220
something where maybe I repeated hot T word mess because I heard it on an episode of Project

30:50.220 --> 30:51.660
Runway and thought it was funny.

30:51.660 --> 30:56.220
And I didn't realize until a few years ago, it actually isn't funny to a large group of

30:56.220 --> 30:56.700
people.

30:56.700 --> 30:58.780
So I stopped saying that.

30:58.780 --> 31:02.620
So I just want to kind of put that out there as the general disclaimer when it comes to

31:02.620 --> 31:03.100
old shit.

31:03.740 --> 31:06.380
Please treat it like it is old shit.

31:07.020 --> 31:11.500
But thank you very much to Dark Tits, I almost said Dark Soccer.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.420
Well, thank you to Dark Soccer for being a part of those shows.

31:13.820 --> 31:16.620
Thank you to Dark Tits for putting that all together.

31:16.620 --> 31:19.500
Now, here's the part where it gets wild.

31:20.620 --> 31:26.540
Not only to Dark Tits put together that whole archive of shows, but last year we went back

31:26.540 --> 31:29.500
and listened to episode one of Orange Launch Radio.

31:29.500 --> 31:34.300
And there was kind of a joke that was being said that, oh, maybe next year you should

31:34.300 --> 31:36.300
go back and listen to episode two.

31:36.940 --> 31:42.700
And the answer was we can't because the recording of episode two was so fucked up.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.780
It has popping all over the place.

31:44.780 --> 31:49.580
It has just all this, like the MP3 is broken and it is unlistenable.

31:49.580 --> 31:50.300
Well, guess what?

31:50.940 --> 31:56.700
If you go to the new oil archive, which I hope somebody's put that URL in chat by now,

31:57.340 --> 32:04.140
you're going to notice in season one, this episode two is the 2022 remastered version.

32:05.100 --> 32:13.420
Dark Tits Suya went through that entire episode, three hour episode, cut out every single pop

32:14.060 --> 32:17.820
and adjusted the pitch to make it coherent.

32:18.700 --> 32:25.260
It is a little rough on the ears still because it's a little garbled, but you can still

32:25.260 --> 32:26.940
at least understand what we're saying.

32:27.660 --> 32:33.820
And I am just impressed at the fact that that is that is like, do you remember in

32:34.460 --> 32:40.380
returns the best Batman movie when the penguin went through all the shredded documents that

32:40.380 --> 32:44.940
that Shrek did and he held them up and he said a whole lot of patience will get you

32:44.940 --> 32:45.660
a long way.

32:45.660 --> 32:49.660
And he like had the whole things all stitched back together that had been through the shredder.

32:49.660 --> 32:56.060
It's very that so kudos to Dark Tits Suya, our very own penguin here at Orange Lounge

32:56.060 --> 32:59.500
Radio for putting that whole thing back together.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.980
That is more than impressive.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.380
And I want to say thank you for that.

33:04.380 --> 33:08.220
And Dark Tits Suya says you have no idea how long that took me.

33:08.220 --> 33:11.820
I can guess that is that is wild, wild, wild.

33:11.820 --> 33:15.420
And G.G. Rama is going, bro, I would have helped you on that.

33:15.420 --> 33:16.220
Good shit, man.

33:16.220 --> 33:16.720
Good shit.

33:17.660 --> 33:25.340
So, yeah, but that is that is a little gift from the community to us and the community.

33:25.340 --> 33:29.660
And honestly, Dark Soccer, Loki and I can really sit here and say we had nothing to

33:29.660 --> 33:30.160
do with that.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.720
They did nothing.

33:32.720 --> 33:33.920
It's a secret to everyone.

33:33.920 --> 33:37.280
Yeah, it was a secret to everyone, no, I mean, he clued us in about a month ago.

33:37.280 --> 33:41.840
He was working on it, but I didn't know he well, because you don't really all our forms,

33:41.840 --> 33:42.340
but that's all right.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.920
Yeah, I know you have the forms.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.200
No, that we have that secret of our form, but it doesn't matter.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.680
So, you know, I actually I couldn't get into it.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.120
I know you were having problems.

33:53.120 --> 33:53.520
It's fine.

33:53.520 --> 33:54.480
It's whatever.

33:54.480 --> 33:55.920
But oh, whoops.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.440
Now I just let out a big secret.

33:57.440 --> 33:59.680
Now people in shadow like the forums are still active.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.120
No, no, they're gone.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.040
There's nothing for you to see there.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.440
We have a 20 year confession time.

34:07.440 --> 34:08.880
We have a hidden forum.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.640
That's why they're still up at all, where we still collaborate on what's going to be

34:12.640 --> 34:13.840
on the show every week.

34:13.840 --> 34:17.920
So it's so we can like story dump our stories and all that good stuff.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.640
So that's the only email Rob that shit.

34:22.720 --> 34:23.220
All right.

34:24.480 --> 34:29.360
So moving on into our kickoff topic tonight, which usually we would tackle a topic in

34:29.360 --> 34:30.800
the gaming industry.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.560
But tonight I thought, eh, you know what the big headline is tonight?

34:35.200 --> 34:36.640
We're turning 20.

34:36.640 --> 34:38.480
So let's make the kickoff topic about us.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.960
So we'll talk about Gamescom or some of this other stuff later.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.240
Let's talk about us a little bit.

34:45.200 --> 34:48.320
And I would like to go through and talk a little bit as we reflect.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.760
We like to raise a toast to me.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.240
I love that.

34:54.240 --> 34:54.880
Yes, I'd like to.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.440
What is the thing you and Dan always say?

34:57.440 --> 35:01.760
I'd like to raise a toast to ourselves and who's like us, damn few.

35:01.760 --> 35:04.080
Oh, no, that's not us that came up with that.

35:04.080 --> 35:07.440
Oh, I thought it's like who's like us, damn few.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.160
And they're all dead.

35:08.880 --> 35:09.600
Okay, that's it.

35:10.640 --> 35:10.960
All right.

35:11.520 --> 35:18.880
So I thought maybe to go back on 20 years of OLR, I have assembled a list of questions

35:18.880 --> 35:25.280
tonight that are the most common questions we get having a 20 year old podcast.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.760
And I thought we could go through and answer them.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.360
So y'all ready for some Q&A?

35:29.360 --> 35:30.080
Y'all ready?

35:30.080 --> 35:30.580
All right.

35:31.200 --> 35:37.680
So the first question I'd like to go over tonight is what's the secret to keeping a

35:37.680 --> 35:41.360
show or podcast going for 20 years?

35:42.080 --> 35:44.720
So what's the secret to keeping this shit up for 20 years?

35:45.280 --> 35:48.240
Routine and unwilling to change your routine, I guess.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.400
Can you elaborate on that?

35:50.400 --> 35:52.560
Like, what do you mean by like unwilling to change routine?

35:52.960 --> 35:55.280
Because like, this is what I do every Sunday.

35:55.840 --> 36:00.160
So I don't know what I guess I'd play more Minecraft if it wasn't doing this.

36:01.680 --> 36:05.760
But yeah, before that, you know, it this is just what I do every Sunday.

36:05.760 --> 36:08.320
So it's, you know, it's routine at this point.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.040
Dark Sakura?

36:11.040 --> 36:11.760
Make it a routine.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.200
I have no idea.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.960
I can speak to a diet like this.

36:16.960 --> 36:17.760
Being stubborn?

36:18.560 --> 36:22.560
I think actually, as much as you may say that tongue in cheek, I think there's definitely

36:22.560 --> 36:23.600
some truth in this to that.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.880
I think stubbornness.

36:24.880 --> 36:32.000
There's a lot of, not a lot, but there's memorable people out there that hoped this

36:32.000 --> 36:32.800
show would fail.

36:34.480 --> 36:41.040
There are people out there that will still try to discredit this show as whatever it

36:41.040 --> 36:41.680
is, I'm sure.

36:43.680 --> 36:46.640
Let me know so I can kick him in the teeth or something.

36:47.600 --> 36:52.080
Well, you know, back in the DDR days, there were certain people in the community that

36:52.080 --> 36:54.000
didn't like us for whatever reason.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.640
Yeah, but we're still here and they're not.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.160
Bingo, bingo.

36:58.720 --> 37:04.240
So one of the biggest haters I can think of worked in the game industry for a little while.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.240
And then as far as I know, isn't anymore.

37:06.240 --> 37:09.040
So it's just something that's just interesting.

37:09.040 --> 37:09.440
Spite.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.480
Spite motivates me.

37:10.480 --> 37:10.800
Yeah.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.640
Spite is a huge motivator, to be honest.

37:12.640 --> 37:17.760
And actually it is a good bit of spite on my part, because as Questbuster just said,

37:17.760 --> 37:20.480
success is the best revenge in a way.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.040
Yeah, it is.

37:21.040 --> 37:25.920
I mean, this show is going to have to end someday and I don't want it to be seen as

37:25.920 --> 37:27.120
a failure when it does.

37:27.760 --> 37:32.880
But the fact that Loki's kids are going to take it over and they're too lazy for that.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.080
I don't think it's going to happen.

37:34.080 --> 37:39.520
The fact that we've gotten to this point and really achieve something that no other show

37:39.520 --> 37:44.240
has, well, I shouldn't say show, but like no other video game related Internet show

37:44.240 --> 37:47.120
or whatever has, is huge.

37:47.120 --> 37:52.880
And even to, you know, there is a club of shows out there that have gone past 10 years.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.160
You know, Bobby's in that.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.720
And that is no small achievement.

37:56.720 --> 38:00.560
Hell, shit, getting past one year is a huge achievement.

38:00.560 --> 38:04.320
And all of that is to be celebrated, whether Spite got you there or what it is.

38:05.280 --> 38:09.360
My answer would be pretty similar to Loki, though, is that when you make it part of your

38:09.360 --> 38:16.320
routine, and it's tricky because you don't want your show to be a job, but you do want

38:16.320 --> 38:18.480
to treat it like a valued hobby.

38:19.440 --> 38:26.880
And I would say to many people, that's church, you know, and many people make church their

38:26.880 --> 38:30.400
thing that they do every Sunday and they get up and they do it.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.320
So in a way, OLR is like church.

38:32.320 --> 38:35.280
And I don't, I don't mean to, especially in light of the things we were talking about

38:35.280 --> 38:38.640
earlier in the show, I don't want to make it sound like sacrilegious or that this is

38:38.640 --> 38:39.760
the replacement for that.

38:39.760 --> 38:40.320
It is not.

38:40.320 --> 38:45.520
But just that that is like the mentality of this, if that makes sense.

38:46.080 --> 38:51.040
So what you're saying is we need to file for a tax exempt status as a church.

38:53.680 --> 38:54.800
I'm reading you.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.000
Yeah, absolutely.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.200
Absolutely.

38:57.200 --> 38:59.040
So let's see.

38:59.040 --> 39:04.240
Looking at some other comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, Tigerthon

39:04.240 --> 39:08.000
chat says having stuff to talk about every week, even during times when there was no

39:08.000 --> 39:10.480
news, you always find something to talk about.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.880
Well, you guys were a huge part of that.

39:12.880 --> 39:19.920
And without sucking up too much, I do want to say, I think the choice for us to have

39:19.920 --> 39:26.000
a live chat ever since the first day, keep that in mind, we were on IRC ever since the

39:26.000 --> 39:30.960
first day, we've always had a live chat and a audience element.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.600
We were taking calls via Skype.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.840
I'm convinced I can't claim this in good faith.

39:35.840 --> 39:43.760
I'm convinced no other show, none, took live calls via Skype before we did.

39:43.760 --> 39:47.600
I am confident we were the first, but unfortunately, I can't prove it.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.000
Maybe the SOL Archive will help.

39:50.000 --> 39:50.560
I have to dig up.

39:50.560 --> 39:51.840
Wait, it's likely.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.360
Yeah, it's very likely.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.280
And again, I'm not trying to toot our own horn.

39:55.280 --> 40:02.240
Indies did pave the way, but I'm just trying to say that that element and that freshness,

40:02.240 --> 40:08.000
that unsurprisingly, or that surprisingness that all that listener elements, I think really

40:08.000 --> 40:09.120
have kept us on our toes.

40:09.120 --> 40:13.840
And what TigerClaw said has allowed there to be something to talk about on this show

40:13.840 --> 40:18.240
when it feels like there's nothing else to talk about because there's always community.

40:18.240 --> 40:22.960
There's always what's going on in our brains and in our hearts.

40:22.960 --> 40:27.840
Or as you heard earlier in the show, what's going on in the real world that's affecting

40:27.840 --> 40:33.520
us that because we're a family of sorts that have been together in similarity with church,

40:33.520 --> 40:35.840
we're a family of sorts that have been together the last 20 years.

40:35.840 --> 40:38.720
There are things in the real world that affect us as well.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.040
That sometimes we have to get off our chest before we get to the games.

40:41.680 --> 40:42.960
It's all a part of it.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.200
So let's see.

40:45.200 --> 40:49.840
Looking at some other class, Sean 322 in chat says routine is a good answer.

40:49.840 --> 40:52.640
Sunday nights are known for The Simpsons and OLR.

40:53.280 --> 40:56.000
Hey, there's something that's longer than this show.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.520
The Simpsons run on TV.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.040
We can't beat that.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.080
We sure can't.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.600
We just have more episodes on them, though.

41:02.480 --> 41:03.280
Oh, yeah.

41:03.280 --> 41:03.680
Have we?

41:03.680 --> 41:04.160
Yeah, we do.

41:04.720 --> 41:05.360
By a lot.

41:05.360 --> 41:05.600
Yeah.

41:05.600 --> 41:09.600
A normal TV show or whatever puts out only about, what, 23 episodes a year, and we've

41:09.600 --> 41:11.280
done closer to 45.

41:11.280 --> 41:16.160
I mean, you would think with 52 weeks in a year, we should be past episode 1000.

41:16.160 --> 41:19.760
And I said this when another podcast crossed that threshold of 1000.

41:19.760 --> 41:24.640
Well, that's a huge achievement, and I'm not going to yuck someone's yum.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.040
But they do multiple episodes a week sometimes.

41:27.040 --> 41:29.040
And during E3, I think they did a ton of them.

41:29.040 --> 41:30.160
So I mean, that's great.

41:30.160 --> 41:31.920
But that's still a huge achievement.

41:31.920 --> 41:32.800
1000 episodes.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.080
We do take a week off here and there.

41:36.080 --> 41:39.120
So we haven't been 1000 weeks in a row.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.520
But real life happens.

41:41.520 --> 41:42.080
Yeah.

41:42.080 --> 41:44.880
We've never missed more than two weeks in a row.

41:44.880 --> 41:49.040
And it takes a bit like when my mom passed, we missed two weeks in a row.

41:49.040 --> 41:52.480
That was, you know, and there's been a couple other instances.

41:52.480 --> 41:56.880
But otherwise, I would say we've always gotten at least two episodes out in a month.

41:56.880 --> 41:57.280
Always.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.160
So there's that, if nothing else.

42:02.480 --> 42:05.680
Salvelus in chat says, 20 years old, still a twink.

42:05.680 --> 42:06.640
Yeah, there's that.

42:06.640 --> 42:07.440
There's that.

42:07.440 --> 42:08.960
All right, let's get to the next question.

42:09.600 --> 42:18.480
Next question is, what's been the biggest story in the past 20 years?

42:19.440 --> 42:20.960
We've covered a lot of stories.

42:20.960 --> 42:22.560
Remember, these are the most common questions we get.

42:23.360 --> 42:25.280
We've covered a lot of stuff here on OLR.

42:25.280 --> 42:28.160
What's been the biggest story in the past 20 years?

42:28.160 --> 42:28.660
Loki?

42:30.000 --> 42:31.200
Of course, come to me first.

42:34.160 --> 42:35.680
Like, I don't know.

42:35.680 --> 42:36.640
There's like so much.

42:36.640 --> 42:37.760
Where do you even choose?

42:38.400 --> 42:39.680
I would say probably.

42:43.280 --> 42:43.760
I don't know.

42:44.560 --> 42:50.160
Gosh, if I'm going to have to pick something, I would say.

42:54.400 --> 42:58.240
The announcement of Bungee Ferret talk scene.

42:58.240 --> 43:03.120
That was a pretty amazing story that didn't get covered by the mainstream media.

43:04.480 --> 43:12.320
No, but I love that answer, because those little OLR cameos in other video games have

43:12.320 --> 43:16.560
been quite the treat for us and quite the reward that even.

43:16.560 --> 43:21.040
And yes, there's been those times where the three of us are extraordinarily frustrated

43:21.040 --> 43:22.800
that we didn't get bigger.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.160
We're not more well known.

43:25.680 --> 43:26.560
And that's OK.

43:26.560 --> 43:31.280
I made peace with that a long time ago myself, because I also realized I don't have the time

43:32.240 --> 43:38.640
that a show needs to really work on that social networking presence to get the show as well

43:38.640 --> 43:40.480
known as it probably needs to be.

43:40.560 --> 43:44.880
I think people that are very well known, it's usually their jobs or something they've been

43:44.880 --> 43:47.600
able to dedicate a lot more time to than I've been able to.

43:47.600 --> 43:48.240
And that's OK.

43:49.600 --> 43:53.200
But those little things like somebody made a text adventure game.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.120
That was the very first one way back in the day.

43:55.120 --> 43:56.880
It was a text adventure OLR game.

43:56.880 --> 43:59.840
And then, of course, YYRS Bungee Ferret tossing was huge.

44:00.800 --> 44:04.080
And then the little cameos that certain unnamed people.

44:04.080 --> 44:08.640
I can't tell you who they are, but it lets you know you got friends in high places.

44:08.640 --> 44:13.120
When we showed up in like the Namco Museum on PlayStation 3, and I just talked about

44:13.120 --> 44:14.240
this like four weeks ago on the show.

44:14.240 --> 44:18.160
But as a reminder, because we have some folks who have been here for a while on the PlayStation

44:18.160 --> 44:22.960
3 of Namco Museum, when you boot up the game, it shows you a sample high score table.

44:22.960 --> 44:27.920
And the high score table says Dark Sakura Sky, which was the name I went by for a long

44:27.920 --> 44:29.120
time, Loki.

44:29.120 --> 44:31.120
And then I think it's like Tangle or something.

44:31.120 --> 44:35.360
They couldn't use Tingle, but they were trying to make a joke of Loki as Tingle as a lot

44:35.360 --> 44:36.640
of people have over the years.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.720
So it was like Tangle or something else like that.

44:38.720 --> 44:41.520
So and that's in a game.

44:41.520 --> 44:46.320
And there was a game on the Wii, an RPG on the Wii.

44:46.960 --> 44:48.640
And I can't remember that it started with an O.

44:48.640 --> 44:49.200
Apuna?

44:49.200 --> 44:49.840
Was that the game?

44:49.840 --> 44:50.880
Yes, it was Apuna.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.040
Our logo is in it.

44:53.040 --> 44:54.080
It doesn't say OLR.

44:54.080 --> 44:56.240
Do you remember the old, old OLR logo?

44:56.240 --> 44:58.560
It's not one we use anymore because it was designed by my ex.

44:59.600 --> 45:01.200
And this is before Jamie had her degree.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.080
It was that little orange looking thing with the stem.

45:04.640 --> 45:06.880
I think it's still on our website because our website's that old.

45:06.880 --> 45:10.080
But that little thing that's in the Apuna game.

45:11.440 --> 45:14.480
So it's very subtle little things like that.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.560
So and that's amazing.

45:16.560 --> 45:17.600
So thank you.

45:17.600 --> 45:18.560
Thank you for that.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.560
So yeah, the gamer tag.

45:20.560 --> 45:22.080
Yeah, yeah.

45:22.080 --> 45:24.240
Def says the gamer tag for OLR.

45:24.240 --> 45:25.600
That was pretty incredible as well.

45:25.600 --> 45:31.280
So and that was because of our relationship with all games and the great years we had

45:32.160 --> 45:32.400
there.

45:33.120 --> 45:38.240
And it also goes to show together we are stronger and can leverage things like that.

45:38.240 --> 45:42.480
So that's all good memories.

45:42.480 --> 45:50.000
So yeah, I think for us personally, over the last 20 years, yeah, little cameos in video

45:50.000 --> 45:54.240
games and in the industry have really shown that we've made it in a weird way.

45:54.240 --> 45:55.440
So thank you for that.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.160
Dark Soccer, do you want to tackle the question?

45:58.160 --> 46:02.080
What's been the biggest story of the past 20 years for you?

46:02.080 --> 46:03.440
The most common questions we get?

46:07.200 --> 46:08.080
I don't know.

46:08.080 --> 46:14.080
I mean, there's been like so many actually big stories that I can't really put a finger

46:14.080 --> 46:15.120
on a single one.

46:15.920 --> 46:23.280
But I reckon for me, like the thing that I guess for something I guess that would have

46:23.280 --> 46:24.400
happened would have been.

46:26.320 --> 46:31.760
The the just the various like news coverage, maybe the president cat thing.

46:33.440 --> 46:38.080
Oh, yeah, when that happened, that was the one time we did kind of break through a little

46:38.080 --> 46:42.000
bit and we all were tweeting the president cat company trying to get that game, which

46:42.000 --> 46:42.720
was never called.

46:42.720 --> 46:43.680
We gave it that name.

46:43.680 --> 46:47.840
Jamie gave it that name because she was like, this name kind of translates to this.

46:48.560 --> 46:55.600
I said that it was sort of like and I meant president as in a president of a company or

46:56.160 --> 46:58.240
and everyone was like President Cat.

46:58.240 --> 47:00.800
And I'm like, it's not quite what that means.

47:00.800 --> 47:01.360
That's all right.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.000
That's all right.

47:02.000 --> 47:02.800
But it caught on.

47:02.800 --> 47:07.040
It was, you know, because that was that was the same year Obama got elected the first

47:07.040 --> 47:07.280
time.

47:07.280 --> 47:08.960
It must have been 2008, right?

47:08.960 --> 47:12.480
So it was the same year he got elected the first time because I remember people were

47:12.480 --> 47:16.240
making the posters that look like his and everything that had President Cat on it.

47:16.240 --> 47:19.440
So, yeah, that was pretty, pretty stunning.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.360
I've had a little time to think about this question, so I'll give you an answer here.

47:23.360 --> 47:27.680
I've got it's really hard for me to not give two and I'll explain why.

47:27.680 --> 47:31.440
So my first answer, I would say the biggest story of the past 20 years is probably the

47:31.440 --> 47:34.640
launch of Xbox Live and that.

47:34.640 --> 47:40.240
But the thing is, Xbox Live launched six months after this show did.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.240
November of 2002 is when Xbox Live started.

47:45.200 --> 47:52.080
So it's been interesting because we've been able to, like, follow that through the

47:52.080 --> 47:55.680
years and see how that has changed gaming's culture.

47:56.240 --> 48:01.600
Xbox Live and the online play and the voice chat has really changed gaming culture.

48:01.600 --> 48:07.920
And I would say evolutions of that, which would be like Discord, quite frankly, are

48:07.920 --> 48:13.280
things that we relied on during the pandemic to keep us gamers connected.

48:13.840 --> 48:17.680
We've always lamented the deaths of arcades here on this show.

48:17.680 --> 48:20.240
Well, in 2020, arcades weren't an option.

48:21.040 --> 48:27.040
So it was because of technology that Xbox Live, I think, started or really made mainstream.

48:27.040 --> 48:31.760
I mean, some would argue that computer chat clients like Ventrilo or whatever that predate

48:31.760 --> 48:31.920
that.

48:31.920 --> 48:36.640
But I would argue that Xbox Live made it mainstream because it put it on consoles for

48:36.640 --> 48:37.600
the first time.

48:37.600 --> 48:41.600
And I think Xbox Live is probably the biggest thing that's happened in the last 20 years,

48:41.600 --> 48:42.160
to be honest.

48:44.080 --> 48:45.120
So that would be that.

48:46.720 --> 48:54.880
But since that is sort of around the same time we started, I would say the other one

48:54.880 --> 49:00.800
that was definitely something we saw the beginning, the middle and the continuation of, I

49:00.800 --> 49:06.720
would say the biggest story in gaming in the last 20 years was the launch of Pokemon Go.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.320
I think.

49:09.680 --> 49:15.360
And the reason why I say that is that we all remember the summer of 2016.

49:16.560 --> 49:17.440
We all remember.

49:19.200 --> 49:24.240
For some people and some conspiracy theorists, that was the summer before the world ended.

49:24.240 --> 49:28.000
And now we're in an alternate universe desperate to get back.

49:29.200 --> 49:35.840
And I think Pokemon Go was a huge part of that because our generation grew up as kids

49:36.880 --> 49:42.320
pretending, you know, maybe those of us here behind the mics right now were maybe a little

49:42.320 --> 49:43.760
more college age.

49:43.760 --> 49:49.680
But we still come from a generation that was like, you know what, mom, I'm going to leave

49:49.680 --> 49:50.880
the house for an hour.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.400
I'm going out to hunt some Pokemon.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.320
And that became a reality in 2016.

49:57.280 --> 50:04.800
And I think as well, I think the other thing of that is that it really legitimized mobile

50:04.800 --> 50:10.880
phone gaming, which I think up until that point, most people were writing off mobile

50:10.880 --> 50:16.080
gaming, including me most of the time, as a bunch of crap because a lot of it was a

50:16.080 --> 50:17.200
bunch of crap.

50:17.200 --> 50:22.240
Or it was stuff where they were trying to force things like, say, a Sonic 2 port or

50:22.240 --> 50:22.400
so.

50:22.400 --> 50:26.640
I don't know why I'm picking on that, but I am a Sonic 2 port that's playable on iPhone

50:26.640 --> 50:31.600
and Android that kind of blows because they try to make a traditional controller work

50:31.600 --> 50:33.280
with a touch controller and it doesn't work.

50:34.000 --> 50:39.040
But Pokemon Go was designed not just with touch controls and that sort of thing in mind,

50:39.040 --> 50:48.560
but to use your location in the real world to pinpoint and really be the first real AR

50:48.560 --> 50:50.480
gaming in the world.

50:51.680 --> 50:54.320
I think that was a huge moment for video games.

50:54.320 --> 50:58.720
And as much as folks joke about Pokemon Go as a dead game, and we even have a story coming

50:58.720 --> 51:02.800
up on it later tonight, I still think it's earned its place in the history books because

51:02.880 --> 51:08.400
if nothing else, that summer we all needed it and we all loved it and we all experienced

51:08.400 --> 51:08.880
that.

51:08.880 --> 51:14.800
And mobile phone gaming broke through like it never had before, as had AR gaming.

51:14.800 --> 51:18.640
So that's my take on the biggest story of the last 20 years.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.800
Okay, let's go to the next question.

51:23.920 --> 51:30.800
What's been your favorite video game of the last 20 years, but besides DDR and Bimani,

51:30.800 --> 51:34.720
because that would be too easy considering that is where this show started.

51:34.720 --> 51:40.000
So what has been your favorite video game of the last 20 years besides DDR and Bimani

51:40.000 --> 51:40.640
type of stuff?

51:42.560 --> 51:43.760
I'll start with this one.

51:47.280 --> 51:52.400
It's actually a tricky one, but I think at the end of the day, I'm going to say Mass

51:52.400 --> 51:52.960
Effect 3.

51:54.080 --> 51:55.840
It would be series, isn't it?

51:55.840 --> 51:57.200
So then just Mass Effect series?

51:57.920 --> 51:59.360
Yeah, because that's really what it is.

51:59.360 --> 52:00.880
It's the Mass Effect series.

52:00.880 --> 52:05.120
The reason why I call out 3 in particular was that the multiplayer put so many more

52:05.120 --> 52:10.640
hours in it, and I didn't hate the story the way the internet did, although I get it, you

52:10.640 --> 52:11.440
know, and all that stuff.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.280
I get why people were upset with it.

52:13.280 --> 52:18.560
And yeah, again, versus Mass Effect 2 even, but just the whole trilogy is really what

52:18.560 --> 52:19.520
it is for me.

52:19.520 --> 52:26.080
And I think that was just the game that I played where I was like, God, I'm so attached

52:26.080 --> 52:27.280
to these characters.

52:27.280 --> 52:36.240
I'm so captured by this game and this experience, and it had that and getting to kill aliens

52:36.240 --> 52:38.800
with friends online and that whole mode and that.

52:38.800 --> 52:41.440
And I think I just got so many good hours out of that.

52:41.440 --> 52:45.840
I mean, yeah, I probably sunk more hours and like Final Fantasy 14 or maybe even World

52:45.840 --> 52:49.200
of Warcraft, really, if we're talking the last 20 years, I probably sunk more hours

52:49.200 --> 52:49.840
in those games.

52:49.840 --> 52:55.040
But I think just overall, when I walked away from the experience going, wow, that was a

52:55.040 --> 53:01.840
video game I was really happy to play, and that was a fucking great video game, I think

53:01.840 --> 53:04.000
was the Mass Effect series.

53:04.000 --> 53:09.840
A close second, Journey, which we just talked about a couple of weeks on the show when Dark

53:09.840 --> 53:11.520
Soccer picked it for the Classic Game of the Week.

53:11.520 --> 53:14.640
I think Journey on the PlayStation 3 is a very close runner up.

53:15.840 --> 53:20.960
To my co-host, Dark Soccer, favorite video game of the last 20 years, not DDR?

53:20.960 --> 53:27.120
I'm going to go with the Mass Effect series and I'm going to go with Dead by Daylight.

53:28.640 --> 53:31.920
I mean, those are just the biggest two off the top of everything.

53:31.920 --> 53:40.480
But I mean, honestly, if I was going to go for something more overall, I would also just

53:40.480 --> 53:49.120
throw in like the whole Beatmania series, like five key Beatmania, because that's kind

53:49.120 --> 53:57.680
of what got me started back in on the path was playing BM98 back in 98 before there was

53:57.680 --> 54:01.520
an Orange Lounge radio, before I had moved to the state.

54:01.520 --> 54:01.760
Right.

54:02.320 --> 54:04.720
Well, if it wasn't for those games, we would know each other.

54:04.720 --> 54:07.200
And that's the simplest that really.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.800
Yeah, I wouldn't have been shaking my butt on Para Para the first day we hung out.

54:12.800 --> 54:13.040
Yeah.

54:14.720 --> 54:16.000
All right, Loki, what about you?

54:16.000 --> 54:18.640
What's been your favorite video game of the last 20 years?

54:19.360 --> 54:24.320
If I had to pick which game I had the most fun in outside of DDR.

54:25.520 --> 54:27.120
It's going to be Grand Theft Auto four.

54:27.120 --> 54:32.640
I had a feeling for sure that it's by far the most fun I've had in a video game.

54:32.640 --> 54:34.560
Close second would have to be Minecraft.

54:36.880 --> 54:39.680
And then probably after that, I would say.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.360
Like Skyrim, probably.

54:43.360 --> 54:44.400
Oh, OK.

54:44.400 --> 54:45.120
It's a good answer.

54:45.120 --> 54:47.040
Yeah, lots of multiple games.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.280
Yep, that is the key.

54:49.280 --> 54:50.160
I love it.

54:50.160 --> 54:53.440
Let's go to chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

54:53.440 --> 54:55.440
E3VL says Persona 5 Royal.

54:56.640 --> 54:58.400
Savalus says Flappy Bird.

54:58.400 --> 55:01.680
I think that might be a little bit tongue in cheek, but you know, you want to talk about

55:01.680 --> 55:04.160
mobile games that really stopped the world for a hot minute.

55:04.160 --> 55:04.960
That would be there.

55:05.760 --> 55:11.280
Bonds 006 kind of left a whole list, but it started with Rock Band.

55:11.280 --> 55:14.000
That's a clever way around the DDR Bamani rule.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.240
Dark Tetsuya says La Mulana.

55:18.240 --> 55:18.960
No surprise here.

55:18.960 --> 55:20.000
I know you love that game.

55:20.000 --> 55:20.640
I know you love it.

55:21.920 --> 55:26.080
Some of the comments on biggest stories of the past 20 years as well, because I didn't

55:26.080 --> 55:26.800
read from that.

55:27.520 --> 55:29.600
Savalus says Leroy Jenkins.

55:30.800 --> 55:31.360
You know what?

55:31.360 --> 55:34.400
I'm pretty sure the biggest meme of the 20 years.

55:34.400 --> 55:38.480
Yeah, Savalus is probably trolling a little bit, which by the way, is Grandpa from Hoard

55:38.480 --> 55:41.920
House, who also said the biggest news story of the last 20 years was when Hoard House

55:41.920 --> 55:42.560
launched.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.680
So hi, Grandpa.

55:44.720 --> 55:49.520
But memes are a huge part of gaming culture now.

55:49.520 --> 55:53.200
And I would say Leroy Jenkins was one of the first.

55:53.200 --> 55:58.480
I don't think you could say the first, but one of the first that just caught on, you

55:58.480 --> 56:04.000
know, that and YouTube's launch kind of was the perfect storm of a meme, you know?

56:04.000 --> 56:06.160
So I'll even say this.

56:06.160 --> 56:11.840
I will, at regular intervals, find a survivor with Jenkins in their name.

56:12.640 --> 56:14.480
In Dead by Daylight.

56:15.600 --> 56:16.160
I love that.

56:16.960 --> 56:17.360
Let's see.

56:18.000 --> 56:23.040
SheHulk10 saying, I thought Loki played Saints Row and GTA 4 the most.

56:23.040 --> 56:27.040
I would imagine Saints Row is somewhere in your list of like top 10 at least.

56:27.040 --> 56:29.040
Yeah, it's like top 10 for sure.

56:29.040 --> 56:29.540
For sure.

56:30.160 --> 56:31.680
All right, let's get to some more questions.

56:31.680 --> 56:32.480
I have two more questions.

56:32.480 --> 56:33.120
Two more questions.

56:34.320 --> 56:35.040
Let's get to the next one.

56:35.040 --> 56:38.400
Next one is what advice do you remember?

56:38.400 --> 56:40.320
These are the most common questions we get.

56:40.320 --> 56:43.520
And I know I get this one at least once a year.

56:44.240 --> 56:50.560
What advice do you have for people wanting to start a new podcast or if you will, because

56:50.560 --> 56:53.120
that's kind of where it's going these days, a new stream or YouTube?

56:53.760 --> 56:58.400
And this is something, you know, Loki does YouTube, Dark Sakura streams, as do I on the

56:58.400 --> 56:59.520
side outside of OLR.

56:59.520 --> 57:01.200
And of course, collectively, we do a podcast.

57:01.200 --> 57:06.800
What advice do you have for people wanting to start a new podcast?

57:06.800 --> 57:08.160
Does anyone want to jump in and go first?

57:09.040 --> 57:12.720
I will start because I literally gave advice to somebody on Thursday.

57:12.720 --> 57:13.280
Okay.

57:13.280 --> 57:17.520
Who actually already has an amazing Twitch channel.

57:17.520 --> 57:20.160
It's the Elk Grove Pinball Twitch.

57:20.160 --> 57:20.800
Oh, sure.

57:22.000 --> 57:28.960
But he is wondering why he couldn't set up, you know, subs or anything, and it's because

57:28.960 --> 57:31.920
he hadn't fit the requirements for affiliate yet.

57:31.920 --> 57:32.800
Right.

57:32.800 --> 57:43.520
And so I was like, the key, I think, to making it as a streamer or podcaster or, or any

57:43.520 --> 57:53.120
of these things is to be consistent and to have your niche and to have something that

57:53.120 --> 58:02.320
you're offering that no one else really has, or a flavor of something that people enjoy.

58:03.040 --> 58:08.000
I mean, I think, I don't know if this is right.

58:08.000 --> 58:15.200
I think that the followers that I have like to hear me complain during the match and then

58:15.200 --> 58:24.320
be all sweetness and sunshine in the endgame chat, you know, or just, you know, trying

58:24.320 --> 58:29.120
to do things in hard mode with, you know, this thumb track ball controller.

58:29.920 --> 58:37.360
Or, you know, you just got to do something that's a little bit different than what everybody

58:37.360 --> 58:38.160
else is doing.

58:38.160 --> 58:39.760
And you have to be consistent.

58:40.880 --> 58:42.960
The consistency is the best part.

58:42.960 --> 58:46.240
And on top of that, you kind of have to be a little bit annoying.

58:46.240 --> 58:53.200
You got to pimp yourself out, you know, that's why every time I go live, even though our

58:53.200 --> 58:57.040
orange lounge thing reposts it, I post it.

58:57.040 --> 58:59.040
I post again halfway through.

58:59.040 --> 59:01.200
I do an announcement on my discord.

59:01.840 --> 59:10.400
I get, you got to be able to shout your own name out to expect other people to also shout

59:10.400 --> 59:10.960
it out too.

59:11.680 --> 59:15.600
And yeah, and like Ron-Chan says, you have to have a love for it.

59:16.160 --> 59:20.400
You have to, you have to, it has to be something that you got to put your heart into.

59:21.120 --> 59:26.640
It's like, you know, when I was getting really burned on playing Dead by Daylight all the

59:26.640 --> 59:30.800
time, you know, because it's not super rewarding to always play killer.

59:33.200 --> 59:41.280
I would, that's when I brought about my classic SNES RPG two days a week, especially because

59:41.280 --> 59:44.160
it's easier to do when I'm just getting off of work.

59:44.720 --> 59:49.520
But, you know, which I put aside during the Dead by Daylight anniversary.

59:50.160 --> 59:57.280
And then I also think that having those special one-offs are also good because they keep things

59:57.280 --> 59:57.760
exciting.

59:57.760 --> 59:59.280
They add a little bit more to your formula.

59:59.280 --> 59:59.920
They're special.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:08.400
That's why I do like a subathon or a follow-a-thon like every few months or so.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:15.040
Um, and also I think that it really helps for you to also find a cause to support.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:26.240
Um, like I'm planning on doing, um, a charity stream down the line once I figure out how

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.120
I want to handle it.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:36.800
But I also think that I'm not saying use someone else's cause as a platform for yourself, but

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:43.120
I mean, get involved in the community and causes that you care about and you get other

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.120
people to get involved with you.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:53.600
So being a force for good in your community is a great thing to do as well.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.920
I mean, again, I'm not saying be, be kind for exposure.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:05.360
That is not at all what I'm saying, but I'm saying get yourself involved, be someone who

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.160
gets involved in the community around you.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.720
Um, I think you've said, oh, of course you've said a lot of excellent points with streaming.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:20.880
The only thing I would really add to that is that, um, it can be very frustrating sometimes

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.120
when it feels like no one is watching.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.760
And if you want to be successful on Twitch, you have to get used to the fact that nobody's

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.760
going to be watching for a little while and you still have to be able to put on a show

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.800
for nobody.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.920
And I know that sounds difficult, but keep in mind your viewer count only updates once

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.200
every five minutes.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.800
You don't know when someone's dropping in just because they happen to come up on the

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.800
recommended or something's going on there.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.120
So you always, yeah, you always want to act like if nothing else, you've got the camera

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:49.920
watching.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.440
And even when it seems like I'm sitting here talking to myself, you know what, tell us

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.720
what's going on in your brain.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.640
Tell us about the decisions you're making in the game.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.640
Tell us why you're doing the things you do.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.880
Tell us, you know, it doesn't always have to be like you have an agenda of topics and

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.440
things like that.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.640
Just give us some insight to the game that you're playing and that your reactions, your

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.680
thoughts and so forth.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.840
It goes a long way.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.400
And when that personality shines through, that's what makes people click the follow

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:14.720
button.

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.520
And I think, you know, and to kind of go back to podcasting a little bit, the only thing

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:25.120
I'd add, because I think you nailed it, with consistency, you have to stick with it.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:30.960
And the minute you start making excuses, you know what, I'm going to cancel my stream

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.640
tonight because I got to fart.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:39.360
Like when you start canceling things for stupid reasons, you're just letting it go.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.160
And so you've got to stick with it.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.520
And that's why a schedule, I don't make a streaming schedule, but a schedule is very

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.640
important for many people.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.400
I do have a streaming schedule for this, and that's kept for 20 years.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.240
And then the last thing I would add to that, you have to have an enthusiasm for what you're

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:56.720
doing.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:03.840
And I don't mean, hi everybody, hi gay, welcome to Pride Month here at Orange Lounge

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.320
Radio.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:09.840
I'm not saying you have to have that kind of over enthusiastic type of tone.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:17.200
I'm just saying you have to enjoy what you're doing because when podcasts really blew up

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.480
when iTunes first launched podcasting and lots of people started doing them, you know

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.080
there were those podcasts that were like, oh, this was so, if you want to go back to

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.920
Horde House, there were so many World of Warcraft podcasts where you would download them

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.360
and be like, this fucking game, this fucking game sucks.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.720
You know, you just play in this game, these changes that they're doing, they suck.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.480
This whole expansion is terrible.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.360
And I don't know, these quests are so lame.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.680
We were doing this raid and the boss was, man, does anyone even test this fucking game?

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:51.360
It's so, what is the product that you're putting out?

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.920
You're not being edgy.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.280
You're being pathetic.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.200
Because you are, and the reason why I'm saying it, like a true friend is going to tell you

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:06.560
this fact because you're advertising, we're doing a show about gaming and then you're

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.840
sitting there just shitting on games the entire time.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.760
That doesn't mean you can't be critical, especially constructively of games.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.560
I like to think that's what we do here at OLR all the time.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:23.680
And I know Loki gets a lot of shit sometimes from listeners because of Nintendo.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.360
I'm always constructive.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.840
But you do, and here we go, y'all ready for me to use a tired analogy?

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.000
Cause I'm gonna do it one more time for the 20th.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.160
It's when Tyra Banks yelled at that supermodel on America's Next Top Model.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.440
We were rooting for you.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.040
We were all rooting for you.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.000
How dare you?

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.840
That is what Nintendo makes us feel sometimes with some of their choices.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.200
They'll get with this century eventually.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.280
They're just only a couple decades behind.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:49.780
It's fine.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.080
So anyway, Loki, I want to give you a chance to chime in, too.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:01.040
What advice do you have for people wanting to start a new podcast or stream or YouTube

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.480
or what have you, any of those things, really?

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:06.320
Like we went back before, it's consistency for sure.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:12.160
You want to make sure that you are uploading content on a regular basis.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.000
Try to be consistent with your schedule.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.160
It may not necessarily be like, oh, hey, I'm going to release on every Friday or something

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:20.960
like that.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:25.040
It's just try to release on a regular basis.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:32.720
As far as more YouTube specific stuff, so algorithm is everything, obviously.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:37.680
So you have to look at search engine optimization.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:45.680
So that could be a lot of like how you phrase stuff, keywords that you put in your description,

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.720
keywords that you put in tags, even though they say tags don't work.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.680
That is nonsense.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.960
Keywords that you put in your title, stuff like that.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:58.640
And you can get plugins, for example, for YouTube to show you what other people use.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.480
And so you just look at like, hey, people that are making some real content.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.320
What kind of tags are they using?

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.960
And then you just put that stuff in there and then you start doing it.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.000
And then all of a sudden it works.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.360
But that's not necessarily important.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.640
It may get more eyes on your content, especially with YouTube.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:20.160
You have to have a good thumbnail because you want to make sure people are clicking

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:20.800
on your content.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.880
But at the same time, you also want to be engaging.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:29.360
Don't come off as in your descriptions, in your content itself.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.840
You know, don't come off as like, oh, I'm just not really good at this.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.760
And I just, you know, I really suck.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:40.720
And, you know, just I'm sorry that my content so bad and all that stuff.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.760
Don't ever do that.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:46.720
Just make content because what you think is bad, a lot of people will think is really

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.360
great.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.200
And I found that out quite a bit like where there's people like, this is amazing.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.080
I'm like, really?

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.280
Is it OK?

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.040
If you say so, it's wild.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.320
But yeah, it's just putting out quality content.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.600
People eventually find it.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.960
And it's all about momentum.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.760
It's just you need to be consistent.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.640
You need to make sure that you're putting out quality content.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:14.240
Eventually, things will kind of pick up speed as you start getting more subscribers and

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:14.720
whatnot.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.800
And it'll eventually keep growing.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.760
But you need to have that momentum and get that momentum eventually.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.240
And don't be afraid to like kind of change up things once in a while, especially when

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:30.400
I do mostly Minecraft content, you know, that revolves around survival multiplayer.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.840
That's not necessarily for everybody.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.400
So also for yourself, so you don't get burnt out, trying different things is nice, too,

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.520
because if you're doing one thing all the time, you're just going to get bored with

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.840
it and you may want to move to something else.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:46.800
So just do similar analogous things to what you're doing.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.320
So in this case, like a hardcore series or something like that, you may get new viewers

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:50.880
from that.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.160
But as far as the podcast goes, obviously having a topic that something that you're

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:04.400
going to want to talk about for weeks on end, having people that you want to talk to as

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:10.000
well, like if you have multiple hosts and whatnot, you want to be able to have people

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.280
that you gel with and they have a good rapport with that type of stuff.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:18.800
So and really any of the content you do, it's just going to be yourself that's coming

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.200
through and people are going to watch it for you.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.480
And that's kind of how it is once you get big enough as well.

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:28.160
It's like it doesn't matter what you do at that point, because people are coming to

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.520
watch you do it.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.640
You know, they are clicking on the video because they want to see you play this game or they

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.280
want to hear you talk about this topic.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.600
So that's really what it kind of I mean, I don't have the whole YouTube thing figured

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.000
out, but we're getting close to 500 subs.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.240
We're like so close work.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.520
Loki on YouTube.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.020
Get him over.

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:51.060
So so we're almost there and you know, we're having it kind of goes in the gaming week,

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.660
but like you got to check out my new video.

01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:54.020
It's super awesome.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:59.460
The intro took a whole day, so it's hand animated frame by frame.

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.180
So that was fun.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.140
But yeah, it's a lot of just experimenting with things and stuff.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.900
So it's just have fun doing it.

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.180
That's really the most important.

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:12.100
If you're having fun doing it and you're enthusiastic about it, if you're having fun,

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.460
it's really not work.

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:16.740
But I mean, it is a lot of work to put out quality content.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:17.700
Just don't overdo it.

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:20.580
You just lose track of it, of the time you're spending on it.

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:23.140
I think it's it's extremely stressful.

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:28.580
I mean, I have nothing to dissuade anybody, but like for me, it's always like it's always

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:29.080
a clock.

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:33.540
It's always a clock because like I put something out, it's like the clock resets.

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:36.980
But I always feel that clock ticking all the time.

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:41.700
And so it's just like I need to get something else out and you get something else out because

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.140
I need that clock to reset.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:48.260
And then there's never seems like a break, but I don't know, you can kind of work it,

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:51.540
you know, maybe not feel so stressed out by that.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:56.980
But if you really want to like drive the momentum and put out more frequent content, I mean,

01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:59.700
that's what you're going to have to do is really push towards doing it.

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:04.020
But also remember these folks that have like millions of subscribers.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.780
This is their full time job.

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:11.780
If you're if you're an adult that has, you know, you already can be like, you know, a

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:16.500
kid that has school or a job and a family like all that takes time.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.460
So you're not going to be able to dedicate the same amount of time.

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.780
And don't worry about not being like perfect.

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.020
Nobody's expecting you to be perfect.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:25.540
They just want you to be entertaining.

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:26.040
Yeah.

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.980
Viewer count is not a measure of your personal success.

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.500
And you'll learn from your mistakes.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.940
Make those mistakes early and frequently so that you learn from them.

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:41.380
I want to give you this comment in chat here over twitch.tv slash vog network from a new

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:41.780
listener.

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:42.660
Good to see you here.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:45.460
Arrington 20 in chat says for sure.

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:48.420
Collab is always excellent for great content.

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:49.300
Absolutely.

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:52.500
I love I will go on like any podcast within reason.

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.260
I want to make sure there's a legitimacy to it.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:11:01.140
And you're sticking shout out to my fellow Channel 64 brother in hearing.

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:02.580
OK, but great.

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:08.260
OK, great example, though, through this Minecraft stuff that you've really stuck with and doing

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:12.100
this YouTube, even when it felt like Loki, nobody was watching.

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:13.220
And you've said that on the show.

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:16.820
Nobody's watching my YouTube, so I don't even know why I keep talking about it.

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.340
You've said something similar to that before.

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.300
And now look how that's come full circle.

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.580
Now you've done enough with it.

01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.540
You stuck with it.

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:27.780
Now you got a crew that wants to work with you and collab on great content.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.900
And now because of that, now people are coming over here.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.660
It's all about fights.

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.020
Yeah, it's synergy.

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:34.580
That's great.

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:36.260
It's all about show Arrington.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:40.980
It's all about finding people that are as enthusiastic about it as you because I've

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:44.020
been with lots of different people and not knocking any of them.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:45.780
Those communities have all been great.

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.820
They've all been great.

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:53.460
It's just that, you know, I was looking for a group of people to be able to be as enthusiastic

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:53.780
about it.

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:58.260
And I have an unrealistic amount of enthusiasm about putting out Minecraft content.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.700
So I was looking for a group of people that shared that kind of enthusiasm.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.820
And it's hard.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.500
You can get like with different groups.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.660
And there may be a couple people that are like that.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:09.700
But so far, you know, with this group, it's everybody.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.300
Everybody has that same enthusiasm.

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:13.620
And it's just great because you just feed off each other.

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.620
It's just really organic.

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:16.340
And I love that.

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:19.380
All right, one more question.

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:22.020
I know we're spending a long time on this, but we're 20 years old tonight.

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.220
It's probably going to be a long show.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:23.860
Okay, here we go.

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:31.140
So one more question, and that is, do you still play DDR or listen to the music?

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.460
Do you still play DDR Bomani or listen to the music?

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:36.660
And I got this is probably one of the biggest questions we get.

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:43.220
I think it's been addressed with the recent saga drama of the YouTube and the sorry, the

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:48.580
Discord challenge that YYR and Rama were going back and forth on a little bit.

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:52.420
So I think this is kind of come up recently, but I will pose it here on our 20th anniversary.

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:54.820
Do you still play DDR Bomani or listen to the music?

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:57.620
Anyone who wants to go first?

01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:04.260
I don't as much as I don't really listen to the music too much.

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.340
At least it's not in my Spotify rotation.

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:07.940
Probably some of it is.

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:15.860
But and I really should be playing more since I have a machine in the garage to do that.

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.060
So it is something I want in your garage, though.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:21.780
And summer is 100 degrees, so it's like 100.

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:26.980
Yeah, the garage gets up to 120 degrees, 130 degrees.

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:31.940
So but you know what, though, when I was actually good about exercising on a regular basis and

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:36.660
doing that diet and exercise stuff like I didn't let the 100 degree heat bother me.

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:40.820
I would just roll up the garage door and just do it, just bear with it.

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.780
But yeah, I haven't done it for a while.

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:48.820
I played like a few weeks ago, but I really need to go back and do it more.

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:58.980
Um, my answer would be I smile whenever I hear a DDR song from like Max 2 and before

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:02.740
Nah, Xtreme and before, because I heard the cartoon hero Speedy Mix the other day and

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:03.460
I did smile.

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:09.940
I still smile when I hear those songs, because I think about a time past, you know, and meeting

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:12.420
my friends and good memories at the arcade.

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.540
I can't say I actively play DDR anymore.

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:23.460
I think a lot of that, a lot of that probably has to do with just access and availability

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:28.180
of a DDR machine and partially my unwillingness to get up in front of like the teenagers that

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:28.820
are playing it today.

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.860
Today's my 44th birthday, okay?

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:37.940
There comes a certain shyness about wanting to play the game around all these young kiddos

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:44.500
anymore these days, but once that new place opens up, I can go over there while school's

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.060
in session.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.540
Yeah, that's what I'm waiting for.

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:51.860
I want that to open up so I can play Dance Rush because I've been looking at that and

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.500
that looks fun.

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:58.660
So, uh, looking at chat, Savilas says, fuck, you're old.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.380
Yeah, I know.

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.580
Pop Culture says 44.

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:03.220
Rob is like, yeah, screw all of you.

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:07.140
But I also have taken the mantle of Twitch's drunk auntie.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.140
I love that.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:11.460
Well, Dark Soccer, what's your answer to the question?

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.620
Do you still play DDR or listen to the music?

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:22.340
I cannot play DDR like I used to, um, just because of, of, I have arthritis in my hip,

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:30.180
I'll admit, you know, I can't do it, but I, you know, if I see a BeatMania machine out

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:31.940
in the wild, I'll stop and play it.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:35.940
I do, uh, you know, when we were going to California Extreme, I would, I would play.

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:42.260
And I mean, in, in my streaming music, my background music that I play during my, my

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:49.220
live streams, I've got like a lot of Taku in there, like stoic and, uh, a few other

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:49.780
things.

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:58.500
Um, I have some, uh, other, you know, songs that have been turned into Bemani songs, like

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.740
Cat's Eye, you know?

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:07.300
Um, but I also was a fan of, of, you know, those original TV shows, you know, that they're

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:07.940
theme songs.

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:15.700
Um, I, uh, and, you know, there's some things that we were fans of before they got into

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:20.740
DDR that I'll still listen to, like, you know, sandstorm sometimes I'll, I'll feel like wanting

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:23.380
to listen to the old, the old things.

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:29.700
Um, you know, I'll even catch myself humming something even when I haven't even listened

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:30.180
to it.

01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:34.660
Like I was trying to clean up the other day and I was actually humming three, two, one

01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:40.100
stars and I was chasing the cat around and it was hilarious.

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:40.260
Yeah.

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:44.100
I actually do have Captain Jack in my playlist rotation right now.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:50.820
I have in the army, I have some erotic in my playlist that I play on stream.

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:54.180
Um, uh, like, especially the ABBA stuff.

01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:58.180
Do that ABBA album is fire in there too.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:16:59.860
Um, oh yeah.

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:03.860
And erotic is actually still putting out, uh, they have like, I think an album, a couple

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:07.300
of, uh, weeks ago, smile DK.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:07.940
Yeah.

01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:11.780
Um, which I remember, I remember, okay.

01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:12.420
Story time.

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:15.780
Anime expo 2000.

01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.140
I w it was my Jill Valentine cosplay.

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:32.020
They had a DDR third mix and people like were doing the code to play, uh, uh, flat mode.

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:36.580
They could play it like second mix, remember, um, or putting in the code for vivid.

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:41.940
And I remember hearing the, the, uh, smile D was it this?

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:43.220
No, it wasn't smell DK.

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:47.300
It was the Olivia project with Xanadu.

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:49.940
And again, thank you for this.

01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:55.140
Funara Xanadu is one of my favorite movies and I was singing along with it and then just

01:17:55.140 --> 01:18:02.740
realized this is coming from DDR and promptly had to play Xanadu in combat boots that had

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:06.900
not been broken in for me and full Jill Valentine cosplay.

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:16.580
And now who's in, who's in dead by daylight, Jill, and I play Claire, but my feet were

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.220
also super torn up after that.

01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.580
That was, it was great.

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:31.620
Um, and, uh, and I remembered being better prepared to play DDR because I had second

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:36.660
mix for dreamcast with those slippery ass dance pads that wanted to break my neck.

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:41.380
And I remember Julie bought another dance pad so that she could play it.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:44.660
Well, Julie has a habit of buying stuff and then never reclaiming it.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:45.460
So now it's mine.

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:48.500
And I learned how to do doubles at home.

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:58.020
And I, I just remember, you know, that, that it was, I still, I still am in love with the

01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:58.420
music.

01:18:58.420 --> 01:18:59.780
I mean, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:02.420
Oh, I just knocked Evie over.

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:03.620
I just knocked Psyduck over.

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:05.540
This thing.

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:06.820
Oh yeah.

01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:07.460
Those things.

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.860
I think those, they're cute, but I think they're kind of, they're kind of crap, but they're

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:12.260
cute.

01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:13.540
It's not, it's a novelty.

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:14.420
It's a novelty.

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:14.900
Yeah.

01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:16.020
And now I need to figure it out.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.020
Oh, but I'm sorry for the podcast listeners.

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:19.460
She held up the little, um, toy.

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:23.380
We have to remember that there's a little toy DDR machine thing that she held up, uh,

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:25.140
that you've probably seen at target recently.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:25.780
And then.

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:26.900
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:27.140
All right.

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:33.540
But anyway, but, but going back to the point on it is that every so often I want to hear

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.340
the old stuff.

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:41.380
And I want to remember, I have a lot of visual memory attached to sound as well.

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:49.460
And so when I have that, when I hear something, it brings back a visual memory with it, including

01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:54.820
the one night I stayed for four hours until I could beat paranoia.

01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.140
Spite goes a long way.

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.420
It goes a long way.

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.300
It's a theme today.

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:01.860
All right.

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:06.340
Those were the five most commonly asked questions we get over the last 20 years.

01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:07.540
Thank you.

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:09.860
Um, for, for indulging us with that.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:12.900
Gosh, that took us a lot of time for our kickoff topic, but that's all right.

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:14.260
It's a special show tonight.

01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:17.940
Um, there was actually another question that came in that I thought was very interesting.

01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:18.340
So sure.

01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:19.300
I'll add one more.

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:24.020
I just don't have a fancy, um, logo or slide for it, which many people are saying nice

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.060
PowerPoint.

01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:25.620
Excuse me.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.900
It's open office.

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:27.540
Thank you very much.

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:30.260
This is a keynote household.

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.220
So, uh, let's see here.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:34.340
Where was the question?

01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:36.980
Um, and again, I just, I really can't stress this enough.

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:38.740
Thank you for the generosity tonight.

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.900
We are doing a podcast, so we don't really stop and read them all live.

01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:46.020
I will acknowledge everybody at the end and we're probably going to have a 10 minute

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:46.980
editing tonight.

01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.100
Um, but thank you so much.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:48.820
I really appreciate it.

01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:49.060
Okay.

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:52.100
Here's the question, um, that came in earlier that I thought was pretty good.

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:55.860
And I want to entertain this and then we'll move on to, um, our gaming weeks and headlines.

01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:04.020
Um, pod culture asked, what's the best and the worst criticism you guys have received

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:07.380
over the years, the best and the worst criticism.

01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:10.340
I have a feeling, I know where your brain is going, Jamie, and I'll let you go first

01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:13.220
because for me, it's the easy answer is the worst.

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:23.140
But if you shit, whoever that was, that I, that I need to stop talking about video games

01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:24.500
and go back to the kitchen.

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:28.020
Number one, fuck wad.

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:34.180
I probably was playing video games longer than you were alive, even back then.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:38.100
And number two, fuck your misogyny.

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.980
You know, you don't want me to make a sandwich.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.260
I'll put razorblades in it.

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:49.380
You can eat that shit and then shit out razorblades and intestines and all kinds of crap.

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.260
I don't care.

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:54.020
That's, that's the easy answer is what's the worst criticism.

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:57.780
And I, even if that criticism wasn't directed at me, I would still, I would have still said

01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.300
the same type of answer.

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:02.340
Well, and I've actually, I'll say this.

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:09.620
I've had an email that's, or I, not me, wasn't me personally, or was it the mail bag?

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:10.580
You might have to remind me, Jamie.

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:11.860
This was a long time ago.

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:16.900
Somebody wrote into the show that they enjoyed listening to our banter and they enjoyed

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:22.740
listening to us talk about the news and stuff and our viewpoints, but that they were praying

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:31.060
for me because of my lifestyle as a gay man who I don't think I was with Alan at the time

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:31.460
yet.

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.060
So I think this was before that.

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:37.220
I think this would have been, I mean, most of these weird ass emails came in around the

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:39.460
time podcasting launched in, in Apple.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:43.060
Cause that's when Jamie got her sandwich email and that's, that's when this one came in around

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:43.700
that same time.

01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:50.580
And so it was just very, like, I, I don't know, like, you know, I could get on a whole

01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:56.820
soapbox and go, it's not on pride month, not today, but I think you all know where my brain

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:57.620
is going with this.

01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:58.820
It's just one of those.

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:05.220
I don't know what this individual thought would be accomplished from an email like that,

01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:09.940
other than a backhanded compliment, which is really what it is, is that.

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.340
They'll have this shit going on today.

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:12.660
Yeah.

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:15.940
I like your news and I like your witty things.

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:19.700
I just don't like your, I just don't like your life.

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:25.300
And it's like, how do you think I got being gay as part of who I am?

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:31.140
You know, I'm not, I like to think I'm not a one note and I'm just gay, this gay, that

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:34.580
I'm not like, um, Jack from will and grace.

01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:34.900
Okay.

01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:39.060
I'm not that I have a more, I'm not a 30 minute sitcom gay.

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:39.860
I have a life.

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:43.060
I do all these things, but it is a part of who I am.

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:49.220
And I wouldn't have the witty banter with Loki and dark soccer or the insight to the

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.100
news and all that.

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:53.860
I wouldn't have that if I wasn't gay and I didn't choose to be gay.

01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:58.420
Let me tell you with all the shit that happened in high school and some of the things I've

01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:01.780
gotten, do you think I would choose to get emails like that?

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:03.220
I didn't fucking choose that.

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:07.620
Anyway, but you know what?

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:08.660
Here's what I wonder.

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:14.420
I wonder in 2022, you know, we've been on the air 20 years is a long time.

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:24.260
And while I bring that up, we have seen gay marriage be legal, then repealed by prop eight,

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:26.500
then repealed again.

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:31.140
So the gay marriage is legal again, down to justice Thomas's comment.

01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:33.620
This last week, we already talked about that stuff at the top of the show.

01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:39.140
I'm not going to go back down to that slope, but we've seen that whole process go through.

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:42.020
And in the last 20 years, I have seen minds change.

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.060
And I wonder if that person is still out there.

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:48.180
And I wonder if they would write that same email today.

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:54.260
And I hope in my heart, maybe they've had an epiphany and maybe they regret writing

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:54.660
that.

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:57.300
In which case, I forgive you if you're out there.

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:05.060
Uh, yeah.

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:07.700
Oh, yes.

01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:09.140
Yes, Marissa.

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:11.140
Nothing wrong with Jack level gay either.

01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.500
Absolutely not.

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:16.580
But I was more trying to comment on in a 30 minute sitcom.

01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:19.060
It's all you get to see of his personality.

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:23.460
I hope that element of my comment isn't lost or what have you.

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:25.300
Okay.

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:26.340
And let's see.

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:30.900
So what about the best criticism that we've gotten over the years?

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:34.260
I don't know.

01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:36.500
This is a tricky one.

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:38.180
I did.

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:40.820
This is more coming from a discussion.

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:49.380
A discussion that I had back with Meg Z back in the day about the power of impact versus

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:49.940
intent.

01:25:52.100 --> 01:26:00.500
And you can intend on a certain thing with what you say, but it's the impact of what

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.100
you say that's going to go further.

01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:10.980
And when we who are in this position where, yes, there are people who listen to us and

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:16.580
I would even go out on a limb and say that we do have a degree of influence out there

01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:22.180
just for people who trust our opinions and like what we have to say, that you also have

01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:29.780
a responsibility then to look at what you say and kind of judge the impact that it might

01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:30.100
have.

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:43.140
Like, you know, if I were to go out and say, well, I think this person needs to do this

01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.620
differently because blah, blah, blah.

01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:51.060
And then it will come out, oh, well, she thinks that all of this is a thing and that everyone

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:51.940
should stop doing it.

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:54.740
People are going to take it out of proportion as well.

01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:57.140
That's something else to also keep in mind.

01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:03.380
But the thing is, is to look at the impact of the words that you say.

01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:05.460
Does that make sense?

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:06.260
Absolutely.

01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:07.060
I think that's huge.

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:09.700
It reminds me of that quote.

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.220
I believe it's a Maya Angelou quote.

01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:15.540
I'm going to butcher it, but it's that whole people won't remember what you say, but they'll

01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.220
remember how you made them feel.

01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:18.980
And it's very that to me.

01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:20.500
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:27.860
Oh, and I mean, also to quote Eddie Izzard too, you know, it's not what you say, but

01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:28.820
how you say it.

01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:31.300
Oh, God, yes, God, yes.

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:36.260
But I mean, like, okay, I actually, I actually know what one of the examples was.

01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:40.100
It's this whole, you know, when, when people were complaining about the ending of Supernatural

01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:49.060
and about the episode, there's an episode where there were Castiel confesses his love

01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:49.540
for Dean.

01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:52.980
And then everyone's like, oh, it's the ship is real, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:27:52.980 --> 01:28:00.500
And I'm like, but you can, you know, I was actually pointing out that it's also okay

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:08.020
to accept that while one man may have a romantic feeling, it's also okay for someone to not

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.420
reciprocate it the same way, you know?

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:15.460
And I was like, I know that you're excited about your ship and I am happy.

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:18.260
If that's the way that you interpret it, then good.

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:20.180
We need more of that in the world.

01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:26.020
I am fully behind you, but I also want to make sure that for those of us, you know,

01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:33.700
that for people who are ace like myself, that it's also fine to understand that, that two

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:36.980
men can love each other platonically.

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:41.700
It can even be a degree of romanticism and not want to go fuck people, you know?

01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:46.340
And it was in that discussion that people were like, oh, homophobia, blah, blah, blah.

01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:47.940
I'm like, do you know who I am?

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:54.020
First of all, and then second of all, I was like, you're not even paying attention to

01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:59.140
it, but that's the thing that you have to think about exactly lining out word by word,

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:04.980
the way you are going to state your opinion so that it won't be taken out of context and

01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.660
have an unintended effect.

01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:15.940
I'm trying to think of the best piece of advice and I'm kind of torn between either

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:19.620
the person that, and I don't even remember who said this, but the person that said,

01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:25.460
you know, one of these days, nobody's going to be playing DDR anymore and you have to,

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.740
then what's your show going to be about?

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:30.820
And that sort of allowed us to, and I'm not knocking, I know many of you are still very

01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:35.780
passionate about the game and so forth, but I think getting away from just talking about

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:40.740
DDR music games was huge for this show and so important in what it is now that I'm very

01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.420
thankful somebody spoke up and said that.

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:46.980
The other best piece of advice would probably be, you know, I was saying earlier that if

01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:51.220
you go back to a lot of those old OLR episodes, there's probably things that we would have

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:57.060
said, like, you know, I mentioned Project Runway inserted the phrase hot blank mess

01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.540
into our vernacular that is inappropriate today.

01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:05.540
Or like, was it like some of the match game stuff where we just try to think of the most

01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:13.380
most inappropriate, uh, it basically, I mean, it was kind of, we played it like, um, cards

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:16.980
against humanity, basically stay the most inappropriate things we could think of.

01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:20.500
Not that we'd actually think that, but it's just like, we're trying to find the most

01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:22.820
shocker.

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:23.460
Yeah.

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:28.260
Whereas now it's like, nah, it doesn't really seem appropriate to do any of that.

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:33.540
Well, and on top of that, the truth came out about the cards against humanity company,

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:38.420
how their office was a toxic workplace and how they abuse their employees.

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:45.380
So I remember we used to sit around playing that, that particular game all the time and

01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:51.540
just how hurtful a lot of the things on there were that, you know, you couldn't do that.

01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:52.040
Yeah.

01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:58.260
So I, I appreciate, and my point with that is I appreciate those that have corrected

01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.340
me from a place of love.

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:02.980
So, um, and concern.

01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:04.260
So thank you.

01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.740
And I would say that's the best feedback, honestly.

01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:09.140
Um, Loki, do you have anything you want to add to that?

01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:10.740
Uh, I know we've talked a lot again.

01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:13.620
Now I have one more question that I've got to do, but you know what?

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:16.580
I don't, if we do questions all night and don't even get to the fucking news, I don't

01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:16.900
care.

01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:19.860
So let's just do more questions.

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:22.100
I didn't really have anything to add to that, unfortunately.

01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:22.580
All right.

01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:22.820
Okay.

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:23.540
That's fine.

01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:25.540
Uh, let me get to this other question here.

01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:28.740
Um, because I thought this was, this was good, uh, from Tay.

01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.740
And I'm not sure if you were here earlier, Tay, and a big shout out to Tay plays games.

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.660
Who is in the last year?

01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:39.460
And I've been on Twitch for like 10 years since it was just in TV.

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:44.020
I haven't taken it seriously since probably VOG came over to Twitch and all that.

01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:48.660
But my point is just in the past year, I've learned a lot from Tay.

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:56.260
Just like really good ideas and like, just like the knowledge share that he's shared

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:56.820
with his audience.

01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:57.780
So just big shout out.

01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:02.580
And, you know, I think he's great and, um, uh, give him a follow, but I want to get to

01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:02.980
this question.

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:05.860
I don't know if you were here earlier because we answered a similar question, but there's

01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:09.460
a, there's a unique component of this that I think makes this worth answering.

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:13.940
And so Tay says, I have two questions for Rob, Jamie and Loki.

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:19.460
What do you think is the single best thing to happen to gaming culture in the last 20

01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:19.860
years?

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:26.100
What do you think is the single worst thing to happen to gaming culture in the last 20

01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:26.420
years?

01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:32.900
So the best and the worst, um, of culture.

01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:37.780
And I think that's, it's not about like gaming stories or news, like we talked about earlier,

01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:38.740
but gaming culture.

01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:43.940
And for me, again, I hate to start with the worst, but I like the answer is just like,

01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:46.260
oh, easy, uh, gamer gate.

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:50.420
What it is, what a piece of trash that whole thing was.

01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:58.820
I mean, just, and it's weird because in a way I would almost say Twitter was also some

01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:07.700
of the best because Twitter gave us like that direct access to game creators for better

01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:08.660
and for worse.

01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:14.980
And believe me, there's a lot of worse as was exhibited by gamer gate, but there's been

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.900
a lot of wholesome moments as well.

01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:23.460
Um, such as when that president cat thing happened and we were all tweeting that Japanese

01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:28.260
developer and some, some poor social media answer, uh, intern or whatever on a Monday

01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:33.380
morning over in Japan is literally tweeting back going, I'm not sure why so many people

01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:36.100
in America are tweeting us, but thank you for the love.

01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:40.180
And we hope to hope to have our game there someday or something like that.

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:44.340
It was just so there was a meeting in an office somewhere because of us.

01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:47.460
Yes, there was a, there was definitely a boardroom meeting somewhere because of us,

01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:51.380
but I loved that, that.

01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:54.900
And to me, that was a, that was a great part of gamer culture.

01:33:54.900 --> 01:34:01.300
So I would say, I would say Twitter and that social media has brought us both extremes.

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.380
It's been the best and it's been the worst.

01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:04.020
I'm sorry.

01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:05.140
What would you want to elaborate?

01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:10.820
Um, I can actually add in one of the really bad things about it.

01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.580
And that's, Oh my God, JV Mon.

01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:13.640
Hi.

01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:15.300
Sorry.

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:18.900
I had to, cause I know there's a lot of old faces tonight, Ella and new ones too.

01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:25.220
Um, but I'm going to go back and to elaborate a little bit on that one, as far as the really

01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:36.340
dark underside, as I'm going to go to in cell culture and the attacks on, on female presenting

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.100
people in gaming.

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:46.340
And mind you, we now exceed the overall population of gamers in general.

01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:53.220
Um, it's, uh, I'm trying to go back to it.

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:59.220
It's these little angry boys on the internet.

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:00.260
I'm just going to say it that way.

01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:05.700
Who for some reason, they, they can't get a date.

01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:16.740
They, they can't, you know, they feel ignored or, you know, the, for whatever reason goes

01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:23.700
on is they think then that this gives them the right to use the anonymity of the internet

01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:27.060
to harass, uh, you know, women in chat.

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:34.420
You, you remember I got bullied off of Twitch before for a bunch of misogynist pieces of

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:37.220
shit that just kept pushing at me and wouldn't stop.

01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:42.180
And I was fucking playing a pigeon dating game, you know?

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:53.780
And, and basically it's, it's really disgusting and really sad because these are the same

01:35:53.780 --> 01:36:00.980
people that are now going out and shooting up schools and malls and attacking populations

01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:08.580
of people because of their own inadequacies, their own sense of inadequacies, not feeling

01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:10.500
supported.

01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:15.940
And, and there is, there's, you know, that ties back into a bigger social aspect of it,

01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:21.460
but that was originally going to be where I was going with this.

01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:26.180
And I mean, there's lots of positives to the advent of podcasting itself has opened

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.820
up very large education channels.

01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:32.340
That's a damn good answer.

01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:37.140
Like just, just like streaming culture in general and the fact that we all have more

01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:37.620
voices.

01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:40.740
I mean, it, but again, there's a dark side to that.

01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:45.860
We all know that, but I would like to say because we can all choose how to curate that

01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:46.340
experience.

01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:48.100
There's been more good than bad for me.

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:48.820
Well, you know what?

01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:50.980
One of my favorite movies is Pump Up the Volume.

01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:52.580
Oh yes.

01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:58.020
And I keep thinking of the end of that movie where after they arrest Christian Slater's

01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:00.660
character and what was her name?

01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:06.980
I want to say Martha Plimpton, but that wasn't her that played the Eat Me, Beat Me lady.

01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:09.380
I don't know.

01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:10.580
It's been so long.

01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:12.820
Yeah, but the two of them get arrested at the end.

01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:16.500
And then after that, you know, again, this is like the mid nineties.

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:22.340
People start busting out shortwave radio sets and trying to say, Hey, I have things to say.

01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:23.380
I have things to say.

01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:24.660
Pirate radio, basically.

01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:35.380
And now we are legally able to go out and broadcast the things that we have to say to

01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:38.420
whoever the fuck wants to listen to it.

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:39.380
Right?

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:42.180
And you know what?

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:47.860
I don't have to be this docile little flower of femininity.

01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:52.020
I can be a loud and obnoxious bitch if I feel like it.

01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:54.820
I can speak my mind.

01:37:54.820 --> 01:38:01.300
I don't have to adhere to whatever cultural norm you think should apply to me just because

01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:02.500
I possess the uterus.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:05.460
And it's freedom.

01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:08.660
It's so freeing that we have this outlet.

01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:14.980
And, and I'm pretty careful about, you know, keeping people from knowing where I live,

01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:16.980
although, uh, Grandpa is where I live.

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:25.220
But, uh, you know, I try to maintain that I've had, you know, my, my stage name forever.

01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:31.700
Rob and I have both had to deal with, with stalkers, you know, again, internet culture.

01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:32.580
Oh yeah.

01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:33.780
I forgot about that.

01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:34.900
Yeah.

01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:43.380
But I think right now for me personally, I'm thinking that the pros of having this voice,

01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:50.100
and also I'm going to say another positive in this whole thing is being in my forties.

01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:54.500
I give fewer shits, number one.

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:55.220
Cheers to that.

01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:59.860
Behold the field in which I grow my fucks and lay thine eyes upon it and see that it is

01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:04.340
buried, but also I have perspective.

01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:08.740
I've grown up with a controller in my hand.

01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:11.540
I grew up playing pinball.

01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:15.300
I still cannot play Frogger well, unless I'm in roller skates.

01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:22.500
And on top of that, the fact that we're staying with both the old and the new, we are continuing

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:26.180
to grow with it and have the perspective to see where it all came from.

01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:33.540
That right then and there, I'm going to say that us old ass gamers are a positive.

01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:38.900
We are one of the best phenomenons that's happened to gaming.

01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:40.580
I love that.

01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:43.140
Loki, I don't know.

01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:45.940
I don't know if you want to follow that, but do you have anything that jumps out for best

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:47.060
and worst in gaming culture?

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:51.300
Yeah, so I I'll just go a different direction, I guess.

01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:54.340
Um, so for worst, it would have to be swatting.

01:39:55.300 --> 01:40:01.780
Oh, that's so good call because because people I mean, you can kind of tie it back with the

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:04.980
whole, you know, culture of like in selling all that stuff.

01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:08.340
But like, yes, swatting where, you know, people can actually die.

01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:09.860
So that's that's bad, obviously.

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:15.860
The best stuff I would probably have to go with, like YouTube and like Twitch, like the

01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:19.460
streaming, you know, getting exposed to a lot of different people, different unique

01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:25.540
things, you know, different ways to play games, different ways to experience stuff, you know,

01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:31.460
even going back to like the beginning, you know, with machinima, there's, you know,

01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:35.060
let's play series, there's all these different personalities that came out of it.

01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:42.020
There's even the extent where we're going beyond like Twitch with, you know, user interaction,

01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:43.220
Twitch plays stuff.

01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:49.380
More recent, I like watching, for example, Doug Doug, who will incorporate his chat with

01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:50.180
different things.

01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:51.380
And that's hilarious.

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:59.940
So a lot of that stuff, I think, is really kind of elevated gaming, especially the way

01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:06.180
we experience as like an entertainment form, you know, beyond what we've had in the last

01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:06.740
20 years.

01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:09.700
I excellent.

01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:12.820
I just wanted to add to that, Jamie.

01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:15.220
It's well said.

01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:15.860
Yeah, well said.

01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:19.700
Okay, we're getting some more questions in chat.

01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:20.180
You know what?

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.780
I'm about to make an executive decision.

01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:23.300
I think we're just gonna say screw the news tonight.

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:25.460
Can I say one thing?

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:28.660
Yeah, we can do like, like, if you have a headline you really want to do, we can still

01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:28.900
do it.

01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:31.220
But yeah, Stadia ain't dead, bitches.

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:38.660
They're expanding their servers to allow some Intel graphics servers.

01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:40.820
And they're hiring.

01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:41.540
You know what I'll do?

01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:42.020
I will.

01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:46.820
I will literally run through the news and we can spend 15 seconds on each headline, but

01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:47.700
I'll do that at the end.

01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:50.180
Okay, but I still want to do classic game and some of our staples.

01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:52.340
Hey, she is not in denial about Stadia.

01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:53.780
I can show you the links.

01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:54.180
All right.

01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.540
I've got the receipts.

01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:56.040
All right.

01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:00.260
Let me get because you guys have some great questions here.

01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:01.700
So I want to get to these.

01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:04.260
I'm trying to like copy paste these to a thing.

01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:06.980
So we were talking about segments and so forth.

01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:09.620
Shehole10 had a really good question here.

01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:13.540
And that is, why did you get rid of the FUs of the week?

01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:17.860
And not everybody may know, but we used to have a segment on the show and it was capped

01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:21.220
off by playing the song One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.

01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:26.500
I think we had some different songs throughout the years, but that was the legendary song.

01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:30.740
And we used to rant about whatever was going on.

01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:36.100
And we actually had, do you remember in the earlier days of OLR, in the Bamani days, we

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:38.260
had Explicit was his name, Jonas.

01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:43.060
And when he was here for the FUs of the week, he would go on and on for like five, six,

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:43.700
seven minutes.

01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:44.340
Love Jonas.

01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:44.500
Yeah.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:45.460
I adore that guy.

01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:49.860
He does a lot of stuff with gaming rooms, anime conventions, or at least he did.

01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:51.140
I don't know if he still does, but yeah.

01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:52.340
I think he was still a part of that.

01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:52.820
Yeah.

01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:53.320
Yeah.

01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:58.180
So it's great to see folks moving on and up and doing these things.

01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:00.660
But why did we get rid of the FUs of the week?

01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:05.300
And well, Jamie, it was a segment you had kind of started and I also saw you answer

01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:06.500
this a little bit in chat.

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:08.500
You want to start with this and I'll follow up on it.

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:09.300
That's our secret.

01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:10.260
We're always angry.

01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:15.380
No, we just wanted to, I mean, especially since it was toward the end of the show, we

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:19.860
wanted to have a little bit more positivity, I think, but I don't know.

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:22.980
We've been sort of at the start of our show.

01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:26.500
I mean, especially with recent things, we have been taking a go off on it.

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:27.940
So maybe it's time to revive it.

01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:33.300
I, for me and the FUs of the week, like I think that's what it is, is that, you know,

01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:37.700
we just said earlier in the show, like the advice that we have is be enthusiastic, be

01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:38.180
positive.

01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:42.980
And it was always weird to kind of talk about the news, but then stop and we're going to

01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:44.100
rant about things.

01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:47.300
And I kind of felt like we were becoming that thing with that.

01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:53.140
Like even if it wasn't really that, it was allowing it to become that thing that I don't

01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:54.580
like in other podcasts.

01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:55.700
And so I was like, why are we doing this?

01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:59.060
We're like stopping the show to do these rants when we don't even have things that we're

01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:00.020
usually ranty about.

01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:05.460
I understand that it is humorous to play one winged angel when we talk about these kinds

01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:11.220
of things, but I don't think that juxtaposition was required in every episode from here on

01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:11.380
out.

01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:15.300
I think if we did FUs again, we need to have happy music playing in the background, like

01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:16.900
the Ohaska or something.

01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:22.340
And I would argue in the first 20 minutes of tonight's show, we did a giant FU of the

01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:22.820
week.

01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:29.140
We just didn't call it the FUs of the week, but She-Hulk and all of our listeners, that

01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:30.900
was an FU of the week for sure.

01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:39.700
So that's why that segment kind of got retired, but it still lives on an ad hoc basis as needed,

01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:41.540
as you saw tonight, for sure.

01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:44.100
Let's see.

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:49.220
And it's also like, we have Twitter now, so it's like, we don't have to wait for the

01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:51.700
episode to come out to complain about something.

01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:54.900
And honestly, there's so much to complain about every week.

01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:56.420
It's just, I don't know.

01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:58.340
I think people just don't want to hear it.

01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:00.660
It may be entertaining, but we can be entertaining in other ways.

01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:09.460
Sorry, my keyboard is so clacky that when I have my mic hot, you can hear it.

01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:11.220
So I have to turn my mic on and off.

01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:15.940
So it's interesting because chat is going back and forth a little bit about Stadia.

01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:21.220
And I thought this comment from Tay is a lot of where my mind is at, is that I think cloud

01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:24.980
gaming in general is a huge achievement that's still in its infancy.

01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:27.620
I'm really excited to see what it looks like in five years.

01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:31.700
And that was in reply to a comment that Pod Culture said that was, there is an argument

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:34.740
to be made that Stadia is a huge gaming moment in the past 20 years.

01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:37.220
Yes, to both those things.

01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:42.980
And I would say that when we're looking back at gaming in 30 years, I mean, who knows if

01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:48.980
OLR is around at 30 years, but if we're looking back on 30 years of gaming, I think cloud

01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:50.740
gaming will be at that moment.

01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:55.940
Maybe, like I said earlier in the show, I think Xbox Live was huge.

01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:00.740
I think we have to see where cloud gaming goes and what the derivatives of that end

01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:01.060
up being.

01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:02.260
And I think we're seeing a little bit of that.

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:08.580
I'm not just talking about straight up copycats like Luna, but also a little bit of what Xbox

01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:15.300
Live is doing and how they are not just having the streaming that is either on your computer,

01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:20.740
it's on the phone, you have access to wherever, but also the fact that they're leveraging

01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:26.740
the cloud processing and all of that in more traditional types of games.

01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:31.300
And I suppose Nintendo, believe it or not, to an extent, does this too by even being

01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:35.140
able to deliver a game like Control on the Nintendo Switch in the first place.

01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:41.540
So I do think we're still seeing the early days of cloud gaming, but we need more people

01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:49.140
to get rid of bandwidth caps, such as Xfinity's infamous bandwidth cap.

01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:50.740
Oh, it can't because they have monopolies.

01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:54.980
So, yeah, more companies are going to have to be pressured to get rid of those before

01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:56.340
cloud gaming can really take off.

01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:58.740
Now, you all know I have a new provider now.

01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:02.340
I have an uncapped provider and it's marvelous.

01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:09.300
And I even told my former provider who was Xfinity, I said, this is the reason why I

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:09.620
left.

01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:11.140
They don't have a cap.

01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:11.460
You do.

01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:17.220
You would think with it, you know, as GPI being gone, that we would be getting some

01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:18.420
momentum on that front.

01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:20.260
But like, it's nothing.

01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:21.460
No, it's a bummer.

01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:26.260
OK, let's get to some more questions.

01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:28.980
And if you haven't, what's that?

01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:29.540
I have cake.

01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:31.460
Yes, you do.

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:33.220
How come you got cake for our birthday?

01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:41.060
Because I told a certain spouse of mine that I really wanted tiramisu.

01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:46.180
A spouse offered to go to said grocery store and find me tiramisu and brought me a tiramisu

01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:46.980
cake.

01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:47.700
Oh, that's nice.

01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:52.340
I'm like, it's my actual birthday today, too.

01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:53.940
I want freaking cake.

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:55.300
But actually, I'm diabetic.

01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:56.260
I don't want cake.

01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:59.780
My husband did give me birthday Chipotle, so I'm very happy for that.

01:47:59.780 --> 01:48:00.820
So I will.

01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:01.220
I will.

01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.460
I will take your burrito and there you go.

01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:04.820
Cake Chipotle.

01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:08.100
I like this one, too.

01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:08.980
So let's go to this.

01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:14.420
I like all the questions, but let's go to this question from Mike Deft, who asks, what's

01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:22.660
OLR's proudest moment, the episode or moment you would show to anyone who doesn't know

01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:23.940
anything about the show?

01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:30.980
What is OLR's proudest moment, the episode or moment you would show to anyone who doesn't

01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:32.020
know anything about the show?

01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:34.900
Proud of when you came out on the show, Rob.

01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:37.620
That's right.

01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:39.380
I forgot that I did.

01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:42.580
You know, and this kind of ties back to something I was talking about earlier.

01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:48.180
Those first couple of years of OLR, I did make a choice where I was like, you know what?

01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:52.260
I don't want to just be the show's token gay, so I'm not really going to talk about it on

01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:52.980
the show.

01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:56.980
And I wasn't necessarily trying to stay closeted.

01:48:56.980 --> 01:48:59.780
I was just saying, I don't want to talk about it.

01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:02.740
So this subject is not something that I want coming up on the show.

01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:03.540
And that was that.

01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:10.180
But there was, I don't remember the moment that changed my mind.

01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:16.660
But I think I had a fuck it moment, as sometimes is ought to happen, where you just say, fuck

01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:16.820
it.

01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:17.540
I'm going to do it.

01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:21.700
And I did.

01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:23.220
And I certainly don't regret it.

01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:29.300
I will say some of the best reward I've had from doing OLR and going back to the best

01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:29.780
feedback.

01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:35.300
You know, I talked about a difficult email I got earlier, but I've also gotten emails

01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:37.140
from three different people.

01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:44.260
And I remember them all over the years that have said, hearing you on OLR and talk about

01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:51.300
your life and how you live out gay and all that stuff, it's helped me accept a lot of

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:51.700
things.

01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:57.460
Sorry, I said I'm not going to do it tonight.

01:49:58.340 --> 01:50:03.460
It's helped me accept a lot of things about who I am.

01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:11.460
And I'm not sure there's been, although I certainly don't like seeing people go through

01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:12.900
that sort of struggle.

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:13.540
I've been there.

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:14.180
I've done that.

01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:15.780
I empathize with that.

01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:22.340
I'm not sure there has been a greater reward in the years of me doing this show than those

01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:22.820
emails.

01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:28.420
End of thought.

01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:28.900
End of thought.

01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:38.660
So thank you, Jamie, for remembering that because I actually forgot.

01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.140
You're right.

01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:40.820
In the beginning, I wasn't out.

01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:41.700
I forgot about that.

01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:46.820
I mean, it wasn't hard to figure out, but I wasn't out.

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:51.220
I didn't have a word for what my deal was at the time.

01:50:52.260 --> 01:50:53.460
A lot's changed over the years.

01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:54.420
Yeah.

01:50:55.140 --> 01:51:02.580
Um, well, since I don't get fan emails, sorry, I don't have anything to add to it.

01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:07.540
But no, I would say like the best moment, I don't really have a moment that would show

01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:13.940
somebody, but like it would be like the early shows when we shared an apartment and it was

01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:15.940
just like everybody gathered there.

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:20.660
I think those would probably be some moments I would show to people.

01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:25.060
Now, the shows were obviously low tech at the time, so it probably wouldn't translate

01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:25.460
very well.

01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:30.580
But those were like peak fun, basically, because you had everybody have that party atmosphere

01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:32.020
like the entire time and stuff.

01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:34.100
So that was fun for sure.

01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:38.340
We so like, you know, I know a lot of people joke about Episode 69.

01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:41.540
And considering tonight, we're on Episode 920.

01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:43.220
So this was a very long time ago.

01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:45.860
Episode number 69 was pretty fucking funny.

01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:50.420
And there's a reason why that show is legendary, because it is that it was at Loki's.

01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:51.700
And I's apartment.

01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:58.740
Sadly, Dark Sakura wasn't there, but her presence was felt the drunk show that the way Yeah,

01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:01.060
there were other shows like it too.

01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:01.940
And the fuck show.

01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:04.980
We tried to be we tried to be PG.

01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:12.580
I remember being drunk off my ass with a microphone in my hand doing this show, kicking the wall,

01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:13.940
yelling, I'm in the matrix.

01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:14.900
I'm in the matrix.

01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:21.860
I don't know if I'm member being drunk in the back room and eating up all of Loki's

01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:22.420
waffles.

01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:26.340
I don't know if I'm necessarily proud of those shows.

01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:31.380
But at the same time, I recognize they were pretty fucking funny.

01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:39.380
And a moment in time, if you will, like, those are not like if somebody was like, why should

01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:40.500
I listen to orange on radio?

01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:42.340
I'm not going to show them the drunk episode.

01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:48.020
I'm probably more proud of the episodes where we have had an impact on the real world and

01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:52.340
maybe taken a stand for things we believe in, such as, like, you know, what we started

01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:54.980
off the show with tonight, not to toot the horn too much.

01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:57.620
But I think some of those moments have been huge.

01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:03.060
I think some of the ways we have been personally affected in our lives.

01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:09.620
I think that first pandemic episode where Jamie may or may not have had COVID and we

01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:13.140
were talking about pneumonia.

01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:19.620
Yeah, we were talking about Death Stranding remotely and talking about some of how that

01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:24.020
is felt, you know, with the weird way the world is like some of those, like, real life

01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:24.500
things.

01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:29.140
I remember the episode the night that Obama went on the news and said they killed Bin

01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:29.700
Laden.

01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:31.860
That all happened while we were on OLR.

01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:32.420
Yeah.

01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:38.500
Yeah, it's things like that where, like, the real world kind of seeped in and we as gamers

01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:41.220
and our family and our culture kind of got to react to that.

01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:47.140
I think those were some of the moments that I thought were, like, these were real moments

01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:48.420
for sure.

01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:56.740
And I would say, honestly, on a completely different note, another, like, best moment,

01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:59.380
E3 2004 to 2006.

01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:07.940
And I know I give the ESA and E3 a lot of shit now in 2022, but damn, let Grandpa tell

01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:11.220
you a story about when E3 was awesome.

01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:19.540
And when we got to go and, you know, we were kids that grew up reading about E3 and Nintendo

01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:21.700
Power and other magazines like that.

01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:24.740
And because of this show, we got to go.

01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:26.580
That was pretty awesome.

01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:31.700
My favorite picture of us was from E3 in 2005.

01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:32.200
Yeah.

01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:36.340
Going to E3 and hanging out in the Konami booth was fun.

01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:43.220
And, like, honestly, like, taking a step back, how special and unreal was that?

01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:49.220
That, like, we were doing a show about DDR and Bamani and Konami, back when they were

01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:52.660
cool, knew about it and noticed us.

01:54:53.540 --> 01:55:01.940
Or that was the press event that they had in San Francisco and they unveiled DDR Super

01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:06.260
Nova and I got to play DDR Super Nova before everybody else.

01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:13.460
Loki was the first person in the US outside of Konami to play DDR Super Nova.

01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:14.900
He was.

01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:15.700
I was there.

01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:20.820
What about us being able to do the Silent Hill stuff for DDR?

01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:21.460
Yeah.

01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:22.500
Oh, the track.

01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:25.700
Yeah, because our friends started working there, which was wild.

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:31.860
And then not just that, but do you remember from DDR Hawaii when they were still around

01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:35.700
and rest in peace still wind because he was a huge part of this and he passed away several

01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:37.780
years ago and you probably knew that.

01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:44.340
But he knew of this show, found this show, and thanks to him, we got to debut songs from

01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:44.740
DDR.

01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:49.540
We basically announced the song list for DDR Ultra Mix 4 before anybody else.

01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:51.940
And that was because of that.

01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:54.900
And you all helping the show to be successful.

01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:55.460
I mean, it's just.

01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:57.060
Holy shit.

01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:57.560
Wow.

01:55:58.420 --> 01:55:59.300
Didn't we have, like.

01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:04.100
We didn't do, like, Max 2 remixes or anything like that, or was there something with the

01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:04.500
remix?

01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:04.980
I don't remember.

01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:05.860
Maybe that's Ultra Mix.

01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:06.500
I'm thinking of.

01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:08.820
What?

01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:09.860
Elaborate.

01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:10.260
What do you mean?

01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:16.100
I thought there was, like, songs that we played on our show that were it wasn't like Max 2

01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:16.900
remixes or anything.

01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:17.780
It was Ultra Mix 4.

01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:21.460
It's the same thing that I was just talking about, basically.

01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:24.740
Yeah, the Max 300 remix for Xbox, says JVMon.

01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:25.220
Right.

01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:28.180
And JVMon also says the Xbox DDR games are so great.

01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:29.220
They really were.

01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:32.260
They were like, DDR Hawaii did such good shit.

01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:37.700
And it's just we need to take a moment to really appreciate what was unappreciated by

01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:38.580
most at the time.

01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:42.260
And that is the DDR Xbox games, because they were all so good.

01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:44.820
And I'm not just saying that because we had friends that worked on them.

01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:47.300
But yeah, it's just amazing.

01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:49.540
So let's see.

01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:53.060
I thought I feel like I missed a question somewhere along the way.

01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:55.460
If I didn't get to your question, will you please post it?

01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:59.460
Just because there's so many of you in chat tonight, and I'm so thankful.

01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:02.180
Hugs, but I'm having a hard time keeping up on chat.

01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:05.700
But we did get another question that came in down here towards the recent stuff.

01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:06.900
So let me get to this.

01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:14.340
So Tay said, if we're keeping this AMA open, I do have another question.

01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:14.900
Sure.

01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:15.860
You know what we already said?

01:57:15.860 --> 01:57:17.940
We're gonna say fuck the news tonight and just do your questions.

01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:22.020
I'd love to know more about the logistics of the show.

01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:26.420
Do you all chat about the show topics the night before?

01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:27.860
30 minutes before?

01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:30.420
Is there a shared Google Doc about topics?

01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:31.860
Who picks the topics?

01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:33.780
Who does the editing and recording?

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.020
Who uploads stuff to podcast services?

01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:37.460
Who does social media?

01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:39.540
Is there one person or do you split it?

01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:41.140
Feel free to answer any of those.

01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:45.460
Okay, so there's a lot of components there.

01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:49.380
So let me just explain what goes through an average OLR episode.

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:52.020
So I kind of gave away earlier in the show.

01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:57.220
There's a secret forum that is the reason why forums still exist on VOG Network.

01:57:57.220 --> 01:58:00.980
And on that forum, people will post stories throughout the week.

01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:03.460
And that is meant to be kind of like a sticky board.

01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:05.460
So like a Google Doc type of thing.

01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:07.380
So Loki will post his stories.

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:09.300
Dark Tetsuya posts things.

01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:12.340
VX Jason, our voiceover guy, shout out to Jason.

01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:15.220
Couldn't have made it 20 years without you in many, many ways.

01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:18.580
And Bobby sometimes will chime in with the topic as well.

01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:23.460
I don't really post stuff there because I'll explain why in a minute, but they'll all post

01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:24.180
things there.

01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:29.460
Dark soccer emails it to me because for some reason, her computer doesn't like the old

01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:30.580
forum software, to be fair.

01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:32.340
It's probably a compatibility issue with the old forum software.

01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:34.740
Like it keeps you setting my password for some stupid reason.

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:41.940
Well, I found that my new system kept trying to block it through the AT&T firewall and

01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:44.900
I had to like set VOG Network as an exception to get around it.

01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:46.660
So it's just, there's some dated tech.

01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:48.580
That's the problem with running a 20 year old show.

01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:49.700
It's dated tech.

01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:58.180
But anyway, so I will then compile all of that into one show role that I basically use

01:58:58.180 --> 01:59:02.500
OpenOffice Excel to put together every week.

01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:03.460
And you know what?

01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:05.620
Since you all asked, why not?

01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:09.300
Let's be completely transparent.

01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:09.860
There you go.

01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:11.540
That's what an average show looks like.

01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:12.980
And that's the one for tonight.

01:59:12.980 --> 01:59:15.620
And it shows you everything we're going to be talking about tonight.

01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:17.300
That we were supposed to be talking about.

01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:20.740
Yeah, so that's why I'm showing this one, because we're not going to get around to

01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:23.220
these topics, but this is what we would have been talking about tonight.

01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:26.820
I also know it's very tiny because, let me see, I'll just do a control scroll.

01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:28.500
So there you can see what it actually looks like there.

01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:31.940
So you can just see like, that's everything.

01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:36.500
So I compiled this into that Excel kind of template that we've used.

01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:38.980
We've used this template over 10 years.

01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:40.820
It used to be a Word doc.

01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:43.460
And then at some point it sort of switched to this thing.

01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:45.380
So it's just, you know, once in a while we changed that.

01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:46.260
Wrong shot.

01:59:48.020 --> 01:59:48.420
Let's see.

01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:50.820
I'm forgetting components of that question.

01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:51.300
So then what?

01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:56.340
Then, so no, we don't really meet beforehand because we kind of know, like the show roll

01:59:56.340 --> 01:59:58.580
kind of lays out who's going to talk about what.

01:59:58.580 --> 02:00:03.620
But we all also, we have a relationship over the past 20 years where we just know.

02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:07.060
We might step on each other's toes a little bit and you just have to roll with it.

02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:08.100
It's live radio.

02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:09.620
That's what we signed up to do.

02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:11.220
There is no second takes.

02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:13.140
Well, there can be.

02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:15.060
If I fuck up the intro, there'll be a second take.

02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:17.220
We've had the do over on occasion.

02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:23.140
But there's very rare second takes, you know, of like actual content in the show.

02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:25.540
And usually it's because of tech issues or whatever.

02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:27.220
That sort of thing.

02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:30.980
So that is kind of how the show all comes together.

02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:36.980
Now I am the one pushing the streaming button and all of that stuff because remember Tay,

02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:42.580
and you may not know this because I think we've only met during the pandemic, but pre-pandemic

02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:44.580
we did this show in person.

02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:51.780
So Jamie and Loki came over to my house and for a little while it was at Jamie's house.

02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:54.260
I would say in the, what era was that?

02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:59.300
It was probably the Shermy era, probably around 2009 to 2012 or something like that.

02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:04.100
It was at Jamie's house, but there was like, Rob had a computer because I just kind of

02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:07.060
knew I, at this point, I just knew how to do it.

02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:09.780
And like, Jamie could back me up if she had to.

02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:10.660
And she did one night.

02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:13.940
Like I remember Tiara hosted one night and I wasn't here and they took over the show

02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:14.440
for a night.

02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:20.500
But like most of the time, you know, I was doing it and that was, you know, it's whatever.

02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:23.540
It's just what happened over 20 years is I just learned how to produce.

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:28.420
So I'm still doing that to this day, basically, even in the virtual environment that we're

02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:28.920
in now.

02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:31.300
And Tay says, oh, I didn't realize that.

02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:35.460
Yeah, so it was a little, so even the show role and all that stuff, that was the exact

02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:37.140
same way when we were in person.

02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:38.660
So that's how that was done.

02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:44.820
And then as far as uploading and putting it on the feed, I do it, but it's not as intensive

02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:47.300
as you think it is because all I do.

02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:54.660
So while this is broadcasting to Twitch, I am also recording a localized movie file of

02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:55.220
this.

02:01:55.220 --> 02:01:57.380
My solid state drives allow me to do this.

02:01:57.380 --> 02:02:02.820
After the show, I will open up the movie file in my audition from like the year 2006 that

02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:05.380
still works and is what I edit the show on.

02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:11.940
And I will crop the show, meaning I'm cutting out the like, you know, the cat video and

02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:14.660
the things that you see on Twitch, you know, it's here in the podcast.

02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:18.660
And then at the very end, the part after, OK, we're done, let's wrap it up, you know,

02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:20.500
that that so it's just the show.

02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:28.740
And then I post that MP3, the website everything is running on was built is really maintained

02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:30.420
by Jason, our voiceover guy.

02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:35.460
If not for Jason, there would not be a place to put this show.

02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:39.300
And that's why I say Jason helps this show in many ways you don't even hear.

02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:42.580
And we're incredibly thankful for that.

02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:47.060
And the actual website that's like Joomla, which is really old, but Deep Man did that

02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:48.020
a long time ago.

02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:54.340
I completely realize the website is showing its age, but I also argue is a website as

02:02:54.340 --> 02:03:00.660
important these days as a Twitter, as a Twitch, as our Twitch channels got to be more good

02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:04.980
looking than a website at this point, because you all subscribe in iTunes and probably don't

02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:05.860
visit the website.

02:03:05.860 --> 02:03:06.980
It's that so.

02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:10.260
God, did I hit all the questions?

02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:12.580
There were a lot of questions there, which is great.

02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:15.300
I'm totally fine giving you a peek behind the curtain there.

02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:18.260
Who uploads stuff to pocket?

02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:19.460
Who does social media?

02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:27.380
Mostly me on Twitter, although Facebook, we don't really use that very often, but we've

02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:28.740
all been known to kind of hop on that.

02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:30.900
Facebook is garbage anyway.

02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:33.780
Yeah, I don't use it so much anymore.

02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:39.460
Social media, and that is probably the blind spot that I wish we got more involved with

02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:44.340
and we probably need to, and especially try to keep up with the newer trends like TikTok.

02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:48.500
I don't fucking know how to clip this show for TikTok.

02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:50.420
And that's where I might need a little help.

02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:52.180
Just play it really, really, really, really fast.

02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:54.980
I can handle that.

02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:56.340
I mean, that part's not hard.

02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:59.220
It's what I do with my stream when I remember to.

02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:04.020
Okay, let's see.

02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:06.340
Some more questions.

02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:08.980
I'm trying to load my queue here so I don't forget anything.

02:04:08.980 --> 02:04:14.980
Okay, let's go to Pod Culture who asks,

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:19.940
you guys mentioned the best games in the past 20 years.

02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:24.340
What's the worst or most disappointing?

02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:27.060
And I think that opens the door to some very different answers.

02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:28.980
WCW Thunder.

02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:34.820
That was so bad that Dan and I returned it to the store, to the blockbuster video.

02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:40.020
Loki, worst game?

02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:45.220
I'm trying to think most disappointing.

02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:48.020
I know there's going to be something and I can't think of it.

02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:51.700
And then as soon as I think of something, it's going to, I'm going to remember what it is.

02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:59.860
Gosh, I don't know.

02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:02.100
I mean, I don't know.

02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:03.300
Give it a couple months.

02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:06.180
I would say, okay, no, no, no.

02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:11.780
Most disappointing, I think for me would be Saints Row four.

02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:14.180
That's most disappointing for me.

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:17.460
Possibly the new Saints Row game when it comes out.

02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:18.740
Although that looks pretty good.

02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:19.620
I mean, it looks okay.

02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:23.060
I mean, I kind of just ignore the characters right now, but.

02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:28.020
Yeah, Saints Row four, I think was pretty disappointing.

02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:30.900
I know there's other things that are more disappointing that

02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:33.380
I'm probably just not thinking of right now.

02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:41.940
If I use my DDR Bahmani roots as a little bit of a crutch here, but I think it's a real

02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:42.660
good answer.

02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:48.340
I would say beat and groovy on the Xbox 360, because that was what we got to represent

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:51.940
the very popular Japanese arcade series, pop and music.

02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:53.860
And boy, did they fuck it up.

02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:55.780
Boy, did they fuck up that game.

02:05:55.780 --> 02:06:02.020
And that could have been like the launch of a new music franchise on Xbox arcade.

02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:03.780
And they could have done such a good job with it.

02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:07.460
But what they gave us felt half baked and incomplete.

02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:08.260
It was terrible.

02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:11.220
It was embarrassing as a Bahmani fan.

02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:11.460
Yeah.

02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:13.460
Dark Two Seas says that game had nine songs.

02:06:13.460 --> 02:06:15.460
Beat and groovy was embarrassing.

02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:21.940
So I think just as somebody who, you know, who star on this show is because of music

02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:23.460
games and that sort of thing.

02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:25.060
That game fucking sucked.

02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:26.340
And that was, yeah.

02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:26.900
Orange Wright says-

02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:27.540
A disappointment.

02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:27.780
Yeah.

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:31.380
Orange Wright says beat and groovy felt like a game they released just to protect a patent.

02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:32.500
Absolutely.

02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:37.380
I'm trying to think if I have a more shocking answer, like a big budget game or something

02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:39.540
that I bought and I just really didn't like.

02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:44.260
But honestly, I don't know if anything was more disappointing than that, to be quite

02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:44.660
honest.

02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:46.340
I'm really trying to struggle to think.

02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:49.460
And I'm not sure I'm coming up with something.

02:06:49.460 --> 02:06:50.100
I'm trying to think.

02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:54.500
I feel like there's been like a remake or something that really pissed me off.

02:06:56.420 --> 02:06:58.020
But I'm coming up short in the moment.

02:06:58.580 --> 02:06:59.540
No, I'm good.

02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:00.100
Good.

02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:00.660
Good call.

02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:03.300
Pod Culture, No Man's Sky version one.

02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:05.700
I didn't hate it as much as everyone else did.

02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:11.700
I don't love it as much as I love it now, but I also didn't buy into a lot of that pre-game

02:07:11.700 --> 02:07:12.020
hype.

02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:15.700
Oh, Orange Wright.

02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:16.100
Yes.

02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:19.060
Original Final Fantasy 14.

02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:20.020
What a turd.

02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:24.740
What a turd of a game that was just, just bad.

02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:28.340
Tay says Spore was a fucking massive disappointment.

02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:34.020
I actually don't know if I hated it as much as everyone else did, but you know what?

02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:39.700
Going back to the earlier question about best moments and because of Orange's radio and

02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:40.660
everything that's been done here.

02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:45.860
I got to it E3 2005, maybe 2006.

02:07:45.860 --> 02:07:54.180
I got to sit in a room, a small room, and watch Will Wright, the man himself, play Spore.

02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:56.660
And walk us through that game.

02:07:56.660 --> 02:08:01.380
And maybe it's because of that memory and the fact I have that sentimental kind of thing

02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:06.660
to it that I forgive that game a lot more than most people.

02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:09.620
And that was a moment to get to see him.

02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:14.020
And it's like, wait, this is the great game maker, Will Wright, actually playing this

02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:15.460
in front of me right now.

02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:16.340
This is incredible.

02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:20.340
At that same E3, I heard it.

02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:22.660
Now I didn't see this one, but I heard that was the one.

02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:28.740
And as famous as where Robin Williams showed up and he did one of the Spore walkthroughs

02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:31.140
and it was apparently pretty legendary.

02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:36.420
And, you know, again, one of the latest, late greatest people anywhere.

02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:40.260
You know, that was that's just kind of it built a lot of hype for that game, for sure.

02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:41.460
But yeah.

02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:43.380
OK.

02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:49.780
Pixel Pacas asks a very good question here.

02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:52.820
And I must say, last call for questions.

02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:56.260
Last call, if you have one or two more, we'll get those and then we'll do some of our other

02:08:56.260 --> 02:08:57.140
segments.

02:08:57.140 --> 02:09:04.980
Pixel Pacas in chat says, Where did you go to find information about how to start broadcasting

02:09:04.980 --> 02:09:06.820
OLR online to begin with?

02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:13.140
Today, it's easy to find how to guides or YouTube videos, but I'll assume that level

02:09:13.140 --> 02:09:14.820
of help didn't exist at the time.

02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:17.780
That's a great fucking question.

02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:20.820
And I'm really having to tap my memory bank.

02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:29.060
So I remember originally reading about podcasting on a Web forum, and I don't remember which

02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:36.260
forum, I'm sorry to say, but I remember reading it described as TiVo, but for the radio.

02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:37.780
And that's how I heard it described.

02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:44.020
And that's when I said we need to fucking get on that because, you know, we were at

02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:48.260
that point with doing Orange Lounge Radio where I was like, man, we're really like,

02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:51.540
I feel like more people are listening to us, but man, I really wish I knew how we could

02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:52.420
just like even push.

02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:57.140
And then when I thought somebody could just download the show and listen to it whenever

02:09:57.140 --> 02:09:58.100
they want.

02:09:58.100 --> 02:09:58.820
Oh, fuck.

02:09:58.820 --> 02:09:59.620
That's that's it.

02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:02.420
That's what we got to do, because I've had so many people tell me I'd love to listen

02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:04.260
to OLR, but I'm busy Sunday nights.

02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:05.540
I do this other thing Sunday nights.

02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:07.940
So I said we need to get on that.

02:10:07.940 --> 02:10:08.740
Absolutely.

02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:13.060
But then I also realized, oh, and some of you know this about the old OLR.

02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:15.780
And if you go to the archives, you'll see this, the old live show.

02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:17.380
We played music breaks.

02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:20.260
We played DDR music and dance meetings during the breaks.

02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:27.060
So I was like, copyright isn't going to let us put that out on a podcast and let us

02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:27.860
download it.

02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:30.180
We're going to have to do a separate show.

02:10:31.140 --> 02:10:32.740
What could we do a separate show about?

02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:34.980
OK, OK, so there's music games.

02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:39.860
What if we did a separate show about all the games, all video games?

02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:45.620
And that's where the first 20 minutes to go edition came from, was us doing other headlines

02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:47.700
and not playing copyrighted music.

02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:53.060
And yeah, there was a while when we would do a three hour with music Orange Launch Radio

02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:59.700
and then 20 minutes to go afterwards and then 30 minutes and then 40 minutes and then 60

02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:00.500
minutes.

02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:07.460
And now it's we're spending four hours, sometimes more here doing all of this.

02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:11.780
And it's like fucking 1030 before I have to drive home.

02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:15.140
I meaning dark soccer, Logie, whatever.

02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:16.340
And do you know what?

02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:18.020
And so it was like, oh shit.

02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:24.420
And then somewhere in the middle of that, Apple launched podcasts and there was a brief

02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:29.700
amount of time where there were thousands of people listening to this show every week.

02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:30.500
Thousands.

02:11:31.380 --> 02:11:34.820
And there were 45 that were here live.

02:11:35.460 --> 02:11:37.140
We love the live audience.

02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:38.980
We love you all.

02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:40.100
You guys turn it out.

02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:45.700
But surely you have to understand the perspective, the sudden conundrum we were faced with is

02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:49.380
that your spinoff show is now popular than your main show.

02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:50.740
How do you fix this?

02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:58.900
And so we reinvented the main show to remove the music breaks and basically become an elongated

02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:00.020
to go edition.

02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:05.780
But with some of our segments, like classic game of the week, I'm not sure it started

02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:06.180
at that point.

02:12:06.180 --> 02:12:08.740
It might have still been like your website of the week or one of those segments that

02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:09.780
came before it.

02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:15.220
But I remember doing website of the week and then the Weebill and Bob folks messaged us.

02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:17.540
Oh, my God.

02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:18.660
That's right.

02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:20.100
Oh, that was wild.

02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:21.380
That is.

02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:21.860
Yeah.

02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:23.860
So yeah, I just have to stop.

02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:26.980
I just saw Didi Archaholic in chat.

02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:28.180
Oh, my God.

02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:29.140
Blast from the past.

02:12:29.140 --> 02:12:30.580
I am so happy to see you.

02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:33.380
It's so nice to hear and see you guys again.

02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:34.900
The seeing part is amazing.

02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:37.540
Now you guys have come so far, isn't it?

02:12:37.540 --> 02:12:37.940
Isn't it?

02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:39.860
Technology is wild, my friend.

02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:40.820
It's so good to see you.

02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:43.620
Yes, I will stop this entire fucking show just to say hi to you.

02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:43.940
All right.

02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:51.460
So anyway, gosh, where was I?

02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:53.380
I don't know.

02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:56.740
My whole excitement for seeing Didi Archaholic totally derailed where my brain was with that

02:12:56.740 --> 02:12:57.140
question.

02:12:57.140 --> 02:12:59.460
But oh, yeah, the question was about how to guides.

02:13:00.820 --> 02:13:04.420
So I don't remember.

02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:08.900
I remember trying to figure out how to get to the podcast.

02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:12.500
I had to download a thing called Lemon Pod, I think was the first because it wasn't an

02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:12.900
iTunes yet.

02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:15.700
So I had to learn about how that all worked.

02:13:16.420 --> 02:13:17.460
I want to say.

02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:25.780
Jason, somebody behind the scenes kind of was like audio RSS.

02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:27.140
I think I know how to do that.

02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:29.140
I don't think that doesn't seem too hard because that's all it is.

02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:32.100
It's like RSS, like a blog, but it's attached audio file.

02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:33.380
I think I know how to set that up.

02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:35.300
And that was it.

02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:36.980
So I did have a lot of help.

02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:44.020
So on the back end, because Jason built the podcast script that is still in use today.

02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:48.660
Might I point out that was built for the original Orange Songs Radio To Go edition.

02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:50.500
Episode one is still in use today.

02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:52.180
And Jason built that.

02:13:52.180 --> 02:13:53.780
I didn't do anything with the tech with that.

02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:56.580
So I guess I had a little help PixelPakas.

02:13:57.300 --> 02:14:03.300
It's nice to have friends and community that help you with that sort of thing.

02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:08.580
We're always thankful for that.

02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:09.220
That's for sure.

02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:12.020
Okay.

02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:15.060
I don't know if any other questions came in, but I'm looking through chat.

02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:16.500
Drew Nami showed up.

02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:18.100
Oh, talk about blast in the past.

02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:18.500
It's so.

02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:21.060
I'm like, you better get your ass in here.

02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:24.580
This is better than going to your high school reunion, which I never went to any of mine,

02:14:24.580 --> 02:14:27.220
but this is even better than that.

02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:35.860
I feel like I missed a question somewhere along the way that said something about the

02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:37.380
next 20 years.

02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:39.620
And like, what was it?

02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:43.300
I might've missed it, but something about the next 20 years and I'm sad I missed it.

02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:50.260
But honestly, my original reaction to that question was I'm not sure this goes another

02:14:50.260 --> 02:15:01.060
20 years, and I don't want to sound defeatist or whatever, but keep in mind another 20 years,

02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:07.220
we're going to be 64, 65.

02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:17.540
I think we kind of have to accept that there's going to come a time when it's time to say

02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:28.100
we did a great thing here, and now we're going to hang up the mantle and let others carry the torch.

02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:36.020
I know Dark Sakura's joked about Loki's kids doing it or Julian or whoever out there.

02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:42.420
It's kind of funny because I know there are podcasts out there about the DDR scene today,

02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:45.620
and I know they don't know who the fuck we are, and that's okay.

02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:50.980
I still see it a little bit as passing the torch, if that makes sense.

02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:54.340
So it's like when you start to see that next generation come up and you kind of go,

02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:56.340
yeah, the kids are going to be all right.

02:15:57.060 --> 02:16:04.580
I think is when you start to say maybe it's okay to start to wind it down.

02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:12.580
So I just kind of, but at the same time, I've been saying that since episode 100.

02:16:15.620 --> 02:16:18.660
So we'll see.

02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:25.460
Yeah, now people are saying OLR in the multiverse and all that stuff.

02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:31.060
JVMON, oh my God, so good to see you, says, nah, OLR till the 50th anniversary.

02:16:31.700 --> 02:16:36.580
TayPlaysGame says, in 20 years we will be rebranding to AARP radio.

02:16:36.580 --> 02:16:38.900
DarkTosia says, OLR the next generation.

02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:41.380
Or PodCulture says, strange new worlds.

02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:44.020
Yeah, a whole universe.

02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:50.340
Well, I mean, if you think about universe, OLR was a spinoff show.

02:16:51.540 --> 02:16:54.500
I'm not going to hide or be embarrassed because I'm not.

02:16:54.500 --> 02:17:00.340
I'm proud of the fact that this show is a spinoff of sorts, of Travis Donovan's

02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:06.740
Understandation Live, and Travis Donovan was the man that taught me any idiot can podcast.

02:17:09.620 --> 02:17:12.180
And I'm so thankful to him for it.

02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:17.220
And this show, I'm well aware, and I'm thankful, has spun off other shows.

02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:22.660
Rama's been very upfront and saying anime jam session is a big part of, you know,

02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:26.260
it's spinoff from what we do here at Orange Launch Radio and all that good stuff.

02:17:28.100 --> 02:17:29.380
And all of that.

02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:35.940
So it's funny because we, but there is kind of an OLR universe already that we fit into.

02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:39.700
So yeah, go ahead.

02:17:40.340 --> 02:17:49.140
I would also like to point out that 60 isn't really that old anymore, being in your 60s.

02:17:50.020 --> 02:17:50.500
No, I know.

02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:55.780
And who knows, maybe OLR won't be around, but maybe we'll still be podcasting.

02:17:56.340 --> 02:17:57.300
Exactly.

02:17:57.300 --> 02:17:57.860
Exactly.

02:17:59.860 --> 02:18:03.460
And some other comments in chat here.

02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:05.780
Where is Travis, says Rama.

02:18:05.780 --> 02:18:08.580
Ultimately, and I'm not trying to say this in a shady or whatever way,

02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:10.420
you'll have to ask him.

02:18:11.060 --> 02:18:17.620
But Travis did retire from this biz, and he's probably hanging with the wife and kids.

02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:18.260
And that's OK.

02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:24.260
You know, so that's what he's, you know, I can still say I'm so thankful that, you know,

02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:28.100
he helped show us how to set up a studio and things like that.

02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:29.940
I knew the audio components I would need.

02:18:29.940 --> 02:18:36.660
I knew what needed to be there to be going into a live 365 station.

02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:39.220
But ultimately, you're going to have to ask him.

02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:44.260
He may not even honestly, because this happens to also be my actual birthday.

02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:49.300
Nothing I'm posting on Facebook is going to get through today.

02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:52.660
So Travis may not even realize it was tonight, to be quite honest.

02:18:52.660 --> 02:18:53.220
And that's OK.

02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:55.860
He doesn't have to circle it on his calendar or whatever.

02:18:56.500 --> 02:19:00.580
So let's see.

02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:02.340
JV Mon says, where's Shane?

02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:03.140
Text him.

02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:04.580
If he's here, he lurks.

02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:11.620
But I will say, holy shit, Shane and I had a hilarious stream on Friday night, I think

02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:16.020
it was, because Final Fantasy 14 wasn't working.

02:19:16.020 --> 02:19:19.220
It was super laggy and it was cutting in and out and all this stuff.

02:19:19.220 --> 02:19:22.580
So I was like, all right, I'm just going to switch to Dead by Daylight because I have

02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:23.780
that up and ready to go.

02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:26.260
It's very easy for me to hit the button to stream that.

02:19:26.260 --> 02:19:28.020
I'm going to do that as opposed to something else.

02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:31.140
And Shane was like, I'll stay on, whatever.

02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:33.540
And I'm like, OK, you know nothing about this game.

02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:35.220
He's like, yeah, it'll be fun.

02:19:35.220 --> 02:19:37.860
He's like, ooh, ooh, you should let me pick your killer.

02:19:37.860 --> 02:19:39.380
And I'm like, all right, let's do this.

02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:40.740
That was funny.

02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:47.540
And then, oh, my God, it's like listening to grandma describe Pokemon because he literally

02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:51.300
didn't fucking know who Freddy Krueger was.

02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:52.180
Or Myers.

02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:53.140
Or Myers.

02:19:53.140 --> 02:19:57.060
And he would be like, oh, no, Bubba Leatherface.

02:19:57.060 --> 02:19:59.140
He was like, that's Butthead, right?

02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:00.100
From Beavis and Butthead.

02:20:00.900 --> 02:20:05.060
It was so I made a highlight of it.

02:20:05.060 --> 02:20:06.820
It's on my personal channel at Rob Roberts.

02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:08.500
I highlighted that whole section.

02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:09.300
It was so funny.

02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:10.580
He guessed pig, right?

02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:12.340
Well, he said no, he said Miss Piggy.

02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:14.660
He said Miss Piggy, but still close enough.

02:20:19.060 --> 02:20:20.900
I like what did he call nurse?

02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:23.060
Pillow face.

02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:24.420
Pillow face or something like that.

02:20:25.860 --> 02:20:29.460
Pillow face, which was fairly accurate there, too.

02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:30.820
She had a pillowcase overhead.

02:20:30.820 --> 02:20:31.060
Yeah.

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:34.100
So that was a fun little side stream.

02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:39.380
And you got a fucking 5K with Ghostface with whatever weird ass build he made for you.

02:20:39.380 --> 02:20:39.540
Yeah.

02:20:39.540 --> 02:20:42.740
He also picked my build and he was giving me shit perks because he doesn't know what

02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:43.460
he's picking.

02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:47.940
I actually had my you weren't there because you came in when Tay raided me.

02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:48.580
Right.

02:20:48.580 --> 02:20:54.500
So you only saw that he had just he was picking his perks for you.

02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:56.980
So you didn't see my survivor matches.

02:20:56.980 --> 02:21:00.340
And in my survivor matches, I said, okay, Shane, pick any perk.

02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:03.860
And like the first one he says, he goes carpal tunnel syndrome.

02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:04.820
Do that one.

02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:06.180
I'm like carpal tunnel syndrome.

02:21:06.180 --> 02:21:06.820
Which one's that?

02:21:07.540 --> 02:21:08.180
No, neither.

02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:10.260
Oh, was the one he was.

02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:10.900
I said no.

02:21:10.900 --> 02:21:13.140
I said, Shane, I'm going to put my foot down.

02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:20.100
That is the one perk you are not allowed to pick because it's the only perk that actively

02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:21.540
hurts your character.

02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:23.140
And it's going to get me targeted.

02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:25.300
Thank you for saying it correctly.

02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:26.020
I looked it up.

02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:27.060
Oh, yeah.

02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:28.820
It's no, neither.

02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:30.580
Yeah, I've heard enough streamers say that.

02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:36.580
It is Northern English slang for being annoyed for bitching.

02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:42.420
So it's like if you can't be bothered or can't be annoyed by it, it's no, neither.

02:21:42.420 --> 02:21:47.220
But yeah, but I love Shane's day for carpal tunnel syndrome is the name of the perk.

02:21:50.180 --> 02:21:50.580
All right.

02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:55.780
But I got fucking tunneled out of the game by a nemesis my first match.

02:21:56.340 --> 02:22:00.180
Like my teammates were being awesome and trying to take hits and stuff.

02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:01.620
And that nemesis didn't care.

02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:04.740
And we think it was because of the pride charm, which sucks.

02:22:04.740 --> 02:22:10.660
But that shows how long ways we have to go in gaming.

02:22:10.660 --> 02:22:11.860
Me trying to play Claudette.

02:22:14.260 --> 02:22:15.300
Got tunneled.

02:22:15.300 --> 02:22:20.740
It's just some people's children.

02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:22.900
And not prestige, but adapted her.

02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:23.220
Nice.

02:22:23.860 --> 02:22:25.620
I have seven survivor adapts, Rob.

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:29.380
As of right now, they're easier than the killer ones though.

02:22:29.380 --> 02:22:30.100
Aren't they?

02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:30.420
Right.

02:22:32.660 --> 02:22:36.020
But, but I mean, this is what I'm doing.

02:22:36.020 --> 02:22:39.780
I'm actually taking a, I'm doing what I'm doing with all the new killers right now.

02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:43.940
And just the first time I play them, I'm only using their default stuff.

02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:48.340
And once I adapt them, then I can, you know, like right now.

02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:52.180
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:53.700
I have to tell you something about that.

02:22:53.700 --> 02:22:55.540
Cause Rob and I were talking about this before.

02:22:55.540 --> 02:22:56.500
I know I'm going off topic.

02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:02.740
So Tay asks, spinoff podcast.

02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:03.240
When?

02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:10.340
So I've been talking with Rob and I've been talking with Finara about doing the state

02:23:10.340 --> 02:23:17.540
of DBD in character hosted by miss Amanda Young, the pig.

02:23:17.540 --> 02:23:23.460
But there's stuff going on about that.

02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:28.500
Cause I'm also doing a visual novel style comic sort of thing.

02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:30.740
That's also kind of in the backend of some stuff.

02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:35.380
Finara and I have actually been getting like screenshots and some, some stuff playing together.

02:23:36.020 --> 02:23:43.860
But but that one's going to be the adventures of Amanda and Meg, the secret besties.

02:23:44.500 --> 02:23:52.820
Um, but, uh, but I think, I think that that's got merit and I need more voice people to be guests.

02:23:55.540 --> 02:23:56.900
I'll go ahead and just throw it out there.

02:23:56.900 --> 02:23:59.140
Now it's, it's, it's something I'm working on in the background.

02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:00.180
Get Tay to do a voice.

02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:01.860
I think who should Tay voice?

02:24:02.580 --> 02:24:03.080
Claudette.

02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:05.700
No, I don't think he should voice Claudette.

02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:08.180
I'm trying, I think he would definitely be a killer.

02:24:08.180 --> 02:24:11.620
And I'm trying to think which killer, uh, which killer would Tay be?

02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:16.340
Probably it's gotta be somebody he really thinks is sweaty and doesn't like.

02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:18.120
Trickster?

02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:20.740
No, we need someone actually new.

02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:21.300
Legion.

02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:23.460
No, cause I bet you or Finara want to do Legion.

02:24:23.460 --> 02:24:24.660
No, I was going to do Julie.

02:24:25.460 --> 02:24:25.940
Bubba.

02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:26.740
Bubba's a good one.

02:24:26.740 --> 02:24:28.100
Tay should definitely do Bubba.

02:24:28.100 --> 02:24:29.140
No, Tay should be Frank.

02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:30.420
All right.

02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:31.940
Anyway, Frank and Bubba.

02:24:31.940 --> 02:24:33.220
You're going to be Frank and Bubba.

02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:34.260
I'm hiring you.

02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:36.500
We've made that transition clearly into our-

02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:37.620
Rob is going to be Nia.

02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:41.460
We've, we've made that transition clearly into our gaming weeks.

02:24:41.620 --> 02:24:44.820
So let's talk a little bit about the other games we've been playing this week.

02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:48.500
Dark Soccer, I don't want to spend an hour on Dead by Daylight, but I did notice you

02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:49.620
are now playing Survivor.

02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:52.580
You finally broke the ice in playing Survivor.

02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:53.460
And I feel like-

02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:54.580
I got forced into it.

02:24:54.580 --> 02:24:58.260
I was like, now that you've had your first hit, I feel like you're kind of, I, I feel

02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:01.780
I'm getting the read, you're kind of into it, but why don't you tell us what's, what's,

02:25:01.780 --> 02:25:02.900
what's the latest on DVD?

02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:03.400
Okay.

02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:08.580
So back in the day, I tried to play Survivor and I hated it.

02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:10.420
That was at least in the demo.

02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:11.700
There's video of this.

02:25:12.500 --> 02:25:18.180
It's on my TikTok of me going around saying, stop healing me.

02:25:18.180 --> 02:25:18.900
I want to die.

02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:30.420
So at any rate, I played, I played two games with, for Thirst Trap, the thing that, that

02:25:30.420 --> 02:25:31.460
Nick and Isaaco do.

02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:35.380
And one game I think Homotron was in it.

02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:40.020
And the other one was Anti Vortex, if I want to, if I remember correctly.

02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:40.980
Nope.

02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:41.300
Nope.

02:25:41.300 --> 02:25:47.860
Cosinon was in one and Anti Vortex was in the other, but at any rate, and I had a hundred

02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:49.060
percent survival rate.

02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:50.260
They covered my butt.

02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:53.300
I, I went to the wrong gate both times and just opened it and left.

02:25:54.820 --> 02:25:56.180
But it was all right.

02:25:56.180 --> 02:26:00.500
You know, I was, I was screaming the entire time and going, oh shit and fucking stuff

02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:00.660
up.

02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:06.900
And, you know, I got hooked exactly once and I was like, okay, I have a hundred percent

02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:07.700
survival rate.

02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:08.660
I'm not going to ruin it.

02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:09.860
No more Survivor.

02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:16.660
And then the anniversary came out and there was a cosmetic, cause you know, my favorite

02:26:16.660 --> 02:26:19.620
thing to do with my survivors is to make them a fashion show.

02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:23.300
Glamour is the end game of any game as a service.

02:26:23.940 --> 02:26:27.700
That is my whole point for even having survivors is to dress them up pretty.

02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:37.060
And there's cosmetic came out for Hattie, the new survivor that I needed all of it.

02:26:37.060 --> 02:26:38.340
It was so cute.

02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:39.380
I needed it.

02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:46.660
And so I, I told Venara, look, I have to play Hattie and please play with me.

02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:47.380
Keep me alive.

02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:52.020
And Venara has been my backbone, my, my gaming partner.

02:26:52.020 --> 02:26:54.980
We were, we were, uh, college roommates.

02:26:54.980 --> 02:26:58.820
I have known Venara more than some of you have been alive.

02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:04.100
So, um, she's been the Nancy to your Drew, but not literally Nancy.

02:27:04.900 --> 02:27:05.460
Hmm.

02:27:05.460 --> 02:27:06.260
I don't know.

02:27:06.260 --> 02:27:11.140
I'm trying to think of famous, uh, uh, crime fighting duo is in history.

02:27:11.140 --> 02:27:13.860
The hard is like the, what's your face to my Daria.

02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:14.180
Okay.

02:27:14.180 --> 02:27:16.100
Oh, Jane, Jane.

02:27:16.100 --> 02:27:17.140
She's a Jane to my Daria.

02:27:17.700 --> 02:27:25.540
Um, but anyway, um, I, I, I played and I was like, okay, I'm just going to start off and

02:27:25.540 --> 02:27:28.020
do a depths, you know, just adapt the whole time.

02:27:28.660 --> 02:27:32.820
Um, and I got through a few games and I was like, you know what?

02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:34.980
This doesn't exactly suck.

02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:39.140
And the thing is what really cinched it for me.

02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:39.460
Okay.

02:27:39.460 --> 02:27:39.780
Yeah.

02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:40.980
I did Michaela next.

02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:41.940
I had points in her.

02:27:41.940 --> 02:27:42.900
I did Claire next.

02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:45.620
I had points in her because I had wanted, you know, Claire.

02:27:45.620 --> 02:27:46.580
Cause that was my thing.

02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:50.580
And I played Meg because I like Meg and Meg was pretty fun.

02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:52.340
It was like GTFO powers.

02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:52.740
I'm down.

02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:56.740
But what cinched it for me was playing Mia.

02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:01.220
Little sneaky ass ninja girl, Nia.

02:28:01.620 --> 02:28:04.340
I am an urban evading.

02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:08.420
You are an urban evasion, Nia.

02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:11.140
And you are not going to apologize for it.

02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:16.340
I am an urban evasion, a balanced landing pebble Nia.

02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:25.700
I tried for the record to use Dead Hard once.

02:28:27.140 --> 02:28:28.420
I don't like Dead Hard.

02:28:28.420 --> 02:28:29.220
They're changing that.

02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:30.020
They're all changing.

02:28:30.740 --> 02:28:32.340
They're all, all those perks are changing anyway.

02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:35.140
Well, yeah, but still I figured I'm just going to use it while I can.

02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:39.620
And booming, I felt completely filthy the whole time on Michaela.

02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:47.540
So I was like, but sneaking around and throwing the pebble and I have like self-heal on her

02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:53.300
for right now, just because people have been kind of, but our self-care.

02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:58.100
But Nia's actually been pretty fun.

02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:01.620
And I'm kind of digging it, although I'm going to work.

02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:03.060
I did Claudette as well.

02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:04.580
It was okay.

02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:05.300
Little boring.

02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:05.620
Sorry.

02:29:05.620 --> 02:29:07.060
I know Tay, Claudette's your girl.

02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:10.340
It's kind of boring to me, but I'm going to do Fang next.

02:29:12.100 --> 02:29:16.500
And then I'm probably going to do Cheryl, but I don't know.

02:29:17.460 --> 02:29:21.540
My Nia is like level 48 right now.

02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:25.780
And this is me playing her for exactly two days.

02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:31.380
So, I mean, yeah, we are getting the bonus points and everything, but well, I don't know

02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:31.620
Tay.

02:29:31.620 --> 02:29:32.500
I have a, all right.

02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:36.020
So Tay says, I mean, all survivors are literally just reskins to hold perks, but I don't take

02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:36.740
it personally.

02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:39.220
No, some survivors though are loud as fuck and annoying.

02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:45.380
I don't, my problem with Claudette is that she sounds like a whimpering puppy when she's

02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:49.860
hurt and I can hear her across any freaking map.

02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:56.900
And I'm like, if I can hear a Claudette from halfway across the map, they'll be able to

02:29:56.900 --> 02:30:01.060
hear me or who else is loud and annoying?

02:30:02.020 --> 02:30:02.500
Yujin?

02:30:03.860 --> 02:30:04.660
Just a few of them.

02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:07.540
Jill, Jill's kind of annoying.

02:30:08.580 --> 02:30:13.300
Nia, however, if she's in crouch mode, you don't hear shit.

02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:13.860
I love her.

02:30:14.420 --> 02:30:17.220
She is the Ninja and that, and I have her in a brown outfit with green hair.

02:30:18.100 --> 02:30:20.340
Just dump me on mother's dwelling and I will hide.

02:30:21.780 --> 02:30:25.540
But anyway, it all started because of my need for cosmetics.

02:30:26.980 --> 02:30:32.100
It's Nia, N-E-A, the November Echo Alpha.

02:30:32.500 --> 02:30:34.020
Did I NATO Alpha that right?

02:30:34.020 --> 02:30:34.740
Close enough.

02:30:35.460 --> 02:30:35.860
Yeah.

02:30:35.860 --> 02:30:36.580
And she's Swedish.

02:30:38.980 --> 02:30:45.700
But anyway, but anyway, that is, that is what got me into playing survivor and the thing

02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:55.860
that I actually find fun about it is that because I've played killer so long, I know

02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:59.540
a lot of tricks that people who only play survivor don't.

02:31:02.180 --> 02:31:06.900
Now, my problem is that because I have to use this, you know, thumb trackball for ergonomic

02:31:06.900 --> 02:31:13.940
reasons, I can't look behind me when I run, but I've found it's actually kind of easy

02:31:13.940 --> 02:31:14.740
to spin people.

02:31:14.740 --> 02:31:20.100
Like I have a hard time if people try to spin me as killer and my, uh, counteraction to

02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:24.180
that is that when people start to do the spin, I stop and they run into me and then I stab

02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:25.380
them in the face and it's awesome.

02:31:26.420 --> 02:31:29.620
But I was spinning this nurse yesterday.

02:31:29.620 --> 02:31:32.980
I mean, she was getting me, you know, at other times, but I was getting some good spins on

02:31:32.980 --> 02:31:33.140
that.

02:31:33.140 --> 02:31:34.580
And on top of that, I was like, is this Elsie?

02:31:34.580 --> 02:31:35.620
Cause it was a compo nurse.

02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:39.780
And then the, um, the weapon was the wrong weapon.

02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:42.980
And then this person obviously wasn't Elsie.

02:31:42.980 --> 02:31:43.700
I'll just put it that way.

02:31:43.700 --> 02:31:46.100
If I could spin her, it wasn't, it wasn't Elsie.

02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:46.500
No.

02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:46.900
Yeah.

02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:48.420
Um, it was a bit at any rate.

02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:53.300
That was, it was my, uh, aesthetic senses that got me into playing survivor.

02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:53.780
There you go.

02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:56.500
And I'm having fun because I'm playing with friends.

02:31:56.500 --> 02:31:58.340
Now we'll hear from both coasts on Dev I daily.

02:31:58.340 --> 02:31:59.700
And I love playing with you too, Rob.

02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:00.660
That was awesome.

02:32:00.660 --> 02:32:03.780
I joined for a little bit on, I think two of your streams actually.

02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:04.900
So yeah, you did.

02:32:04.900 --> 02:32:05.380
You did.

02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:11.380
Cause I, I, I did, I actually, I was going to do all killer on Thursday and Friday.

02:32:11.380 --> 02:32:15.940
And then, uh, I did, uh, I ended up doing survivor both of those days.

02:32:15.940 --> 02:32:18.660
And then I forgot I was streaming last night for some stupid reason.

02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:19.700
I just wanted your flan.

02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:21.540
Yeah.

02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:25.300
But I played two games with, uh, Elsie and company last night.

02:32:26.020 --> 02:32:26.740
That's fun.

02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:28.500
And they were playing protect the Sakura.

02:32:29.860 --> 02:32:30.420
It was cute.

02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:34.740
Getting involved in the streamer communities and stuff is really, really fun.

02:32:34.740 --> 02:32:35.140
I think.

02:32:35.140 --> 02:32:35.380
Yeah.

02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:37.300
Funara the meat shield.

02:32:38.260 --> 02:32:41.300
And then, uh, and then Sierra was like, aren't you supposed to be streaming?

02:32:41.300 --> 02:32:42.820
And I'm like, oh yeah.

02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:46.180
So I did a bunch of killer matches and help people farm.

02:32:46.180 --> 02:32:50.260
And just, uh, I was trying to finish getting the community achievement.

02:32:51.380 --> 02:32:56.180
And I couldn't, because I'm not that good at evasion as survivor yet.

02:32:56.180 --> 02:32:57.940
I did the chaser one is killer.

02:32:58.660 --> 02:33:00.420
Um, and that was pretty fun.

02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:05.940
And I met new people and I made new friends and now I'm 15 followers away from 500.

02:33:06.180 --> 02:33:07.300
Oh, so close.

02:33:07.300 --> 02:33:08.180
Get there, get there close.

02:33:08.180 --> 02:33:10.500
We have some people who haven't visited in a long time tonight.

02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:12.100
Be sure to drop your Twitch in there.

02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:17.700
Uh, of course I'll still be playing afterwards and maybe not for my full three hours now,

02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:19.380
but I might be playing for a little bit after.

02:33:19.380 --> 02:33:19.940
Yeah.

02:33:19.940 --> 02:33:20.420
All right.

02:33:20.420 --> 02:33:20.920
Yeah.

02:33:21.700 --> 02:33:22.740
I'll shout myself out.

02:33:23.940 --> 02:33:25.060
Um, let's see.

02:33:25.060 --> 02:33:28.020
Um, so my gaming week, I'll, I'll just keep it real brief.

02:33:28.020 --> 02:33:31.700
Um, with the new computer, I've been playing a lot of the same stuff, but it's just so

02:33:31.700 --> 02:33:35.380
nice to play things like Final Fantasy 14 and it's so smooth.

02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:38.660
Uh, and, uh, I also play a little dead by daylight as we talked about earlier.

02:33:38.660 --> 02:33:41.940
And then I've actually been spending a lot of time on Diablo two resurrected.

02:33:41.940 --> 02:33:47.540
I know like how random, but I did, it was, it was a little, it played okay on my old

02:33:47.540 --> 02:33:49.300
computer, but on this one, Oh, it's butter.

02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:50.500
And it looks so good.

02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:52.340
And the reflections are so nice.

02:33:52.340 --> 02:33:55.940
And, uh, the whole thing just has me hype for Diablo four, to be honest.

02:33:55.940 --> 02:33:57.780
I'm not sure I'm going to play much more Diablo two.

02:33:57.780 --> 02:34:00.740
Cause it's just like, Oh yeah, that old game was really grindy.

02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:02.580
You had to drop a lot of hours in this game.

02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:05.780
But, um, it has me hype for Diablo four.

02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:08.420
And I'm, I'm just excited to see the pretty graphics.

02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:10.180
I also played no man's sky.

02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:11.940
What I, um, big shock, right?

02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:13.700
But here's the pleasant surprise.

02:34:13.700 --> 02:34:17.780
I've always said that the Microsoft stuff and the things you earn there, you can't use

02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:19.140
them in the steam version.

02:34:19.140 --> 02:34:19.940
Well, guess what?

02:34:19.940 --> 02:34:24.900
If you download the windows game pass version instead, everything transfers over because

02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:26.340
it's still Xbox.

02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:28.580
So I can play on PC and keep all my crap.

02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:32.180
I just have to play in the windows store and I'm totally fine doing that.

02:34:32.340 --> 02:34:34.340
It really doesn't fucking matter to me what store it's on.

02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:35.620
I just want to play the game.

02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:39.940
So I stayed in my steamer, like for dead by daylight, if I can ever get dead by daylight

02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:45.140
to run on steam, then all of my, uh, achievements and cosmetics will carry over.

02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:46.180
Oh yeah.

02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:46.420
Yeah.

02:34:46.420 --> 02:34:48.020
Cause the, yeah, that's nice for that game.

02:34:48.020 --> 02:34:48.580
Yeah.

02:34:48.580 --> 02:34:50.020
So, um, that's it.

02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:50.660
I'll keep it short.

02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:53.860
Cause I know we still have like our classic game and stuff, but Loki, I want to get to

02:34:53.860 --> 02:34:54.180
you too.

02:34:54.180 --> 02:34:55.140
How was your gaming week?

02:34:55.700 --> 02:34:56.980
It was Minecraft.

02:34:56.980 --> 02:34:57.780
Surprise.

02:34:57.780 --> 02:35:05.700
Um, no, this week we, I started off on the new, actually it was last week, um, on that

02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:09.300
Saturday started on channel 64, the new SMP that I'm playing on.

02:35:09.300 --> 02:35:15.380
And so I put out my first episode this week, which is, um, a little bit shorter than I

02:35:15.380 --> 02:35:15.780
want to.

02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:20.500
The problem was I did so much in that like first few days that I couldn't really fit

02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:21.940
what I wanted to include in there.

02:35:21.940 --> 02:35:27.060
So that's going to be kind of this next episode plus a build, uh, which I'm working on right

02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:27.700
now.

02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:31.460
Um, so yeah, it's been, it's been a lot of fun.

02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:33.220
So I've been really enjoying that.

02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:38.660
And then as far as other things, there weren't other things as usual.

02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:39.620
All right.

02:35:40.180 --> 02:35:40.820
But you got some.

02:35:40.820 --> 02:35:41.380
Oh no, no, no.

02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:41.700
I'm sorry.

02:35:41.700 --> 02:35:41.940
Sorry.

02:35:41.940 --> 02:35:42.420
Sorry.

02:35:42.420 --> 02:35:45.220
There was one other thing also Minecraft.

02:35:45.220 --> 02:35:53.540
Um, so I film what probably will be the last episode of my hardcore series in which I fought

02:35:53.540 --> 02:35:59.380
the under dragon with about eight to 10 wardens also running around at the same time.

02:35:59.940 --> 02:36:00.980
So that was fun.

02:36:00.980 --> 02:36:03.380
So think that'll be coming out.

02:36:03.380 --> 02:36:07.860
I don't know if I want to continue that series anymore or if I can, you know, I don't want

02:36:07.860 --> 02:36:09.060
to spoil anything.

02:36:09.060 --> 02:36:14.100
Um, so that may be the end, but that'll be coming out soon.

02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:15.380
I just have to edit it down.

02:36:16.980 --> 02:36:17.380
All right.

02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:18.820
Okay.

02:36:18.820 --> 02:36:23.300
Uh, because of all the great questions, our Q and a segment tonight went pretty much took

02:36:23.300 --> 02:36:24.900
up the entire show, which is fine.

02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:28.180
I don't, I wouldn't want to spend our 20th show any other way, but we did kind of end

02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:29.620
up saying, fuck the news.

02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:32.580
Uh, we will quickly run through the headlines this week.

02:36:32.580 --> 02:36:36.820
We're going to spend no more than like two sentences on each headline.

02:36:36.820 --> 02:36:40.180
So our first story, Sony is skipping games com.

02:36:40.180 --> 02:36:41.700
I don't know if there's a lot more to say than that.

02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:43.940
Loki, they're not going to be there.

02:36:44.980 --> 02:36:46.340
Maybe they'll do their own thing.

02:36:46.340 --> 02:36:47.060
Is it a big deal?

02:36:48.420 --> 02:36:51.060
Um, I don't know if they have anything in the show.

02:36:51.060 --> 02:36:54.580
Honestly, I think they might just be saving for their own thing.

02:36:54.580 --> 02:36:58.180
Um, and I think there'd be a lot of questions about VR too and stuff.

02:36:58.180 --> 02:37:03.140
I just think, you know, even though many people have decided the pandemic is over, I don't

02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:04.340
think it really is.

02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:05.780
And there's a lot of that.

02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:09.060
That's probably of a concern to Sony as well, where it's like, maybe now just isn't really

02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:12.580
the time, especially if they want to, if they want to show off a VR headset, the middle

02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:14.500
of the pandemic is not a great time to do that.

02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:16.580
So no recession.

02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:17.080
Yeah.

02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:19.540
Activision stockholders.

02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:24.260
I know that, um, Bobby Kotick is still going to be on the board, which has a lot of people

02:37:24.260 --> 02:37:27.220
saying literally what the fuck is happening.

02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:29.220
Um, because that's some bullshit.

02:37:29.220 --> 02:37:34.660
Um, but otherwise there's this weird thing where the stockholders had voted to release

02:37:34.660 --> 02:37:39.700
the annual harassment reports and the company has said, we'll consider doing that.

02:37:41.940 --> 02:37:46.580
The stockholders seriously need to revolt and Bobby Kotick needs to be thrown out on

02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:48.180
his stupid ass.

02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:54.660
I just, that guy's day of reckoning is long overdue, long overdue, um, dark soccer.

02:37:54.660 --> 02:37:58.580
This ties into the beginning of the show, but the, um, video game companies talking

02:37:58.580 --> 02:38:00.020
about the Supreme court ruling.

02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:01.060
Oh yeah.

02:38:01.060 --> 02:38:02.180
Bungie blasted them.

02:38:02.180 --> 02:38:07.940
So many other companies are standing in solidarity and there's a lot of companies out there that

02:38:07.940 --> 02:38:13.300
are, uh, basically already offering to pay travel expenses for people who have to go

02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:16.900
out of state for, uh, for their healthcare.

02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:17.400
Yeah.

02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:23.640
Uh, Sonic origins ha had, um, it launched, but I guess it's got issues, right?

02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:24.140
Logie.

02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:25.080
Yeah.

02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:30.920
It was developed under a major time crunches and it was also not necessarily perfect when

02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:31.800
it came out.

02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:37.800
And according to some of the devs, they were complaining about, um, some of the performance,

02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:41.720
you know, that they had basically, you know, that their performance under such pressure,

02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:46.440
but you know, everyone is very unhappy about the state of origins and even the Sonic three

02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:47.000
component.

02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:53.720
Um, I know they're like Sonic three, for example, also had like some of the music changed in

02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:56.440
it because of licensing issues, which this is great.

02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:02.280
Cause we did get a confirmation from Yuji Naka that Michael Jackson did end up composing

02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:03.400
music for Sonic three.

02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:05.240
It was heavily suggested.

02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:07.640
Now the internet can shut the fuck up about that.

02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:08.040
God.

02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:10.600
But like it was legit actually though.

02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:11.160
It's funny though.

02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:16.360
Cause there is a video I watched about talking about the, um, comparison by game explain

02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:20.440
and actually some of the music isn't necessarily from Michael Jackson.

02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:28.680
One of them is literally like a chip tune version of a, um, actual like song that wasn't

02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:29.960
by Michael Jackson.

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:34.680
So they couldn't include that as well because, you know, you didn't license that song.

02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:36.680
So oops, oops.

02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:38.040
All right.

02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:39.640
Um, let's see.

02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:43.880
Our next story was that there was a Xenoblade Chronicles three direct this week, uh, from

02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:44.280
Nintendo.

02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:47.240
So Nintendo did a direct, but it was all about Xenoblade Chronicles three.

02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:50.840
And honestly, it just kind of made me think I need to go back and really beat the first

02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:51.000
game.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.040
Cause it was really fun.

02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:55.480
I played like 10, 15 hours of it, but I never actually beat it because that game can take

02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:56.680
hundreds of hours.

02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:01.080
I wasn't as into the second game, but I wonder if it's because I didn't really finish the

02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:03.800
first one, although the two stories are disconnected.

02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:07.560
But yeah, I know the people that are really hyped for that series really enjoyed the direct.

02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:10.200
A lot of different things are planning to do with it, like amiibo support and things

02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:10.600
like that.

02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:12.200
So it's going to be a real good summer.

02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:16.840
If you're a Xenoblade fan, cause there's a whole nother game for you to eat up, uh,

02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:19.160
dark soccer, you'd reference Stadia earlier in the show.

02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:27.880
Stadia is hiring right now for, um, an engineering manager, immersive stream for games, Stadia.

02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:35.080
Um, and basically, uh, they are looking into major projects.

02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:40.360
So basically wanting someone to major, uh, to lead a team for designers.

02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:47.480
Um, and then, um, of course there's also that expansion into having Intel compatible games.

02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:55.480
Um, they're still not leaving the AMD universe, but there's also, uh, as seen in their change

02:40:55.480 --> 02:41:00.920
log, there's also, uh, uh, evidence that there's going to be a saints row release.

02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:07.880
Um, and, uh, they're gonna, they're go leading to Stadia 4.18.

02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:13.720
So there will be different exploration, uh, 1440p and motion controls.

02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:19.000
So long story short Stadia is not as dead as a lot of people seem to think it is.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.440
They're still expanding.

02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:20.940
Yup.

02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:26.760
Uh, Loki, I talked about this game earlier, Pokemon go and we're debating it again, right?

02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:31.960
It's it's, it's just more of the same stuff we've been hearing for a while now about how

02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:39.320
Niantic keeps pulling back different things that they had put in place during the pandemic

02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:41.240
that people kind of got accustomed to.

02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:46.600
And now, um, you know, especially like with remote rating, um, they stopped giving out

02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:53.320
the free, uh, weekly one, uh, coin remote rate pass, um, that was available.

02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:59.080
And then now they've chart or they're upping the cost of the three remote rate passes.

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:05.080
So now that's instead of, you know, paying 250 where you get like a 50 coin discount

02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:12.040
for buying three, uh, it is now just 100 coins each pass, which is kind of annoying.

02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:16.680
Plus they also decided that half the length of the community day from the six to three

02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:20.120
hours, uh, from 11 AM to 2 PM only.

02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:27.880
So, and they're saying that there's, was it the ability to ask or that players are also

02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:32.760
going to be able to extend the day past 2 PM by taking part in a new type of gym.

02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:36.280
That was the whole real new thing that they did with this community day, which I didn't

02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:37.240
care for.

02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:39.720
Um, this part, because Mike Deaf says this is old news.

02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:43.480
Yeah, the, the, the recapping going on this week is kind of encompassing both what happened

02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:47.480
before and what they did with this community day, which they made some changes and it made

02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:50.520
the evolved form of dino spawn more often.

02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:51.800
I did community day.

02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:52.840
It was hot out.

02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:54.200
I did not have a good time.

02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:58.040
I caught my three shinies and I was done and it was a lot harder to catch shinies cause

02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:00.360
that stupid evolved zelius or whatever.

02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:04.280
Well, it was nice to, I understand people wanted it for the exile candy, but those things

02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:06.440
can't be shiny and it was silly.

02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:10.920
And then the raid thing, it was like, I'm not, I can't, the, the problem with Niantic's

02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:13.400
thinking about, we're going to get out everybody in person.

02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:17.960
Well, when they limit it to certain timeframes and stuff, it was a hundred degrees here.

02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:19.400
No, I'm not doing that.

02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:24.840
So it was just, I, there's still a lot of, a lot of kinks to be worked out.

02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:25.880
That's for sure.

02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:28.760
And that's the weather isn't all like the Bay area.

02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:29.480
Exactly.

02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:33.080
Everywhere in the country, in the ferry building where Niantic's located.

02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:33.400
All right.

02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:34.840
Anyway, uh, moving on.

02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:39.720
Halo master chief collection is looking at adding microtransactions, which is surprising

02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:43.400
is that game is eight years old, but, um, I kind of go, you know what?

02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:47.320
Mario Kart eight is also that old and they're still releasing DLC.

02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:48.360
So you know what?

02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:52.440
If they want to extend the life of that game, just make the microtransactions have value.

02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:55.240
I'm not sure if it's silly cosmetics, it'll have value, but

02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:02.120
Halo master chief collection is kind of like the Wii sports of game pass.

02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:06.360
And I feel like even though, yes, that game is eight years old, it's like that greatest

02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:07.560
hits collection.

02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:09.240
It's like Abba gold.

02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:12.920
It's a CD that's going to sell for years and years and years and years.

02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:14.360
Cause it's just the classics.

02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:15.960
And I think that's kind of where Halo master chief.

02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:19.160
But I don't think this is, I don't think this is like that though, because they're

02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:24.280
adding an in game currency, which it's because they want to do a battle pass.

02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:25.480
I'm sure with the multiplayer.

02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:25.640
Yeah.

02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:30.440
But like you could just sell that stuff for like real money.

02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:31.400
Like you just buy it.

02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:33.160
You don't have to buy an in game current.

02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:33.880
I mean, I get it.

02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:35.720
They want to turn it into a live service.

02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:38.600
Maybe because Halo Infinite's not working as well for them.

02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:39.080
I don't know.

02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:40.920
Or maybe they just double dip that stuff.

02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:43.560
But, um, yeah, I don't like it.

02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:45.720
Do do something else.

02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:49.320
Like if you're going to do that, or like, you know, the master chief collection is not

02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:52.440
free, you know, make, make it free then.

02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:54.280
No, but it is, it is a game pass.

02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:57.880
And I think a lot of people are, are which, but I know game pass is free.

02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:02.120
I'm just saying, I think they're loading it a little bit because they know this is like

02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:03.400
a go-to staple.

02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:05.000
Many people install with game pass.

02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:07.080
Sort of my thought on that.

02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:09.320
Just, you know, vote with your wallet.

02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:09.800
That's right.

02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:11.240
Vote with your wallet at the end of the day.

02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:12.680
All right.

02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:16.600
Well, now we're going to, in our next segment, take a trip down memory lane to a game that

02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:21.560
is way too old for them to patch with microtransactions.

02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:24.040
And I'm sure many of you are very curious.

02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:25.480
What did Jamie pick?

02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:26.920
20 year old show tonight.

02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:29.320
Let's go roll the bumper.

02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:45.240
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:47.560
out a classic and tell you about it.

02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:50.200
It's time for the classic game of the week.

02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:56.120
And I have to admit, I'm only a little surprised at this pick because I thought, oh, she'll

02:45:56.120 --> 02:45:59.960
do like Bamani DDR or something, but you went kind of a different direction.

02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:05.400
You were like, I'm going to pick a classic bold, underlined, italic.

02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:14.280
Like this game is how we have many other, many other games, a genre of games, but dark

02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:15.320
soccer, I will say no more.

02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:18.200
What did you pick for the classic game of the week?

02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:20.200
I picked asteroids.

02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:22.760
We're going old school with this.

02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:28.360
So Asteroids is a multi-directional shooting game.

02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:31.800
It was designed by Lyle Rains and Ed Log.

02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:38.680
It was released in arcades in North America, November, 1979 by Atari.

02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:46.200
You are a spaceship in an asteroid field, you have some flying saucers go by, but you

02:46:46.200 --> 02:46:51.320
have to shoot and destroy the asteroids and the saucers while not colliding into either

02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:53.320
or being hit in the crossfire.

02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:57.480
And the game, of course, gets harder as you go.

02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:03.720
This is considered to be one of the very first from the golden age of arcade games.

02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:08.200
It sold over 70,000 arcade cabinets.

02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:12.680
And it's been a hyper influential over the decades.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:19.800
And I would actually fifth dream says this is No Man's Sky Zero, right?

02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:23.800
I'd say actually, probably without this one, we wouldn't have No Man's Sky.

02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:25.080
We wouldn't have a lot of games.

02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:32.840
And indeed, this game was considered to be a direct influencer of Defender and Gravatar

02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:34.440
and a few other games.

02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:43.000
So Asteroids was, they came up with it when Log and Rains used some of the hardware that

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:50.680
was developed by Howard Delman that had been used on Lunar Lander to make a game and they

02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:55.400
based it off an unfinished game called Cosmos using its physics model, the control scheme

02:47:55.960 --> 02:48:01.400
and gameplay elements that also were from Spacewar!, Computer Space and Space Invaders

02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:02.360
and they refined it.

02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:10.840
The game is rendered on a vector display with a two dimensional view that wraps around both

02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:11.640
screen axes.

02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:20.200
So going into this, this is also one of those games that taught us how to exploit some of

02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:24.920
the code in it because there's what's called a lurking exploit.

02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:31.800
So basically, the saucers were supposed to begin shooting when they appeared and it got

02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:32.200
changed.

02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:36.600
And additionally, they could only aim at the player ship on screen and they are not able

02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:39.000
to see beyond the game boundaries.

02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:45.720
So you could lurk near the edge of the screen opposite the saucer and so basically it couldn't

02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:46.200
shoot you.

02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:57.240
They did put out, they have Atari patched the game, they patched the EPROM and removed the

02:48:57.240 --> 02:48:57.800
exploits.

02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:00.520
So here's also an early example of game patches.

02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:13.640
But going back to the design of the game, basically, Log was really impressed with the

02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:20.200
Atari video computer system, which was retitled to the Atari 2600.

02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:23.800
And so he joined Atari's co-op division to work on Dirtbike.

02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:25.160
It's a game that never came out.

02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:30.120
It had an unsuccessful field test, also joined by Paul Mancuso.

02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:37.720
He was on the development team as the asteroid's technician and engineer Howard Delman also

02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:40.280
worked on the hardware.

02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:49.960
And so the other fella in this reigns discussed a game called Planet Grab, which is a multiplayer

02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:52.680
arcade game that was renamed to Cosmos.

02:49:55.560 --> 02:50:06.440
And basically it went from there and so basically it just ended up, well, actually the game

02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:11.320
Cosmos that they had in its unfinished version, it had a giant indestructible asteroid.

02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:16.040
And so Reigns asked Log, well, why don't we have a game where you shoot the rocks and

02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:16.840
blow them up?

02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:19.000
And so the concept was born.

02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:22.680
It was developed as a vector game.

02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:28.280
So, of course, the lines are all drawn, the graphics are all drawn on a vector monitor.

02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:35.160
Although Reigns originally wanted it to be done in raster graphics, but Log wanted Vector

02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:40.520
because it would allow more precise aiming and a higher quality image.

02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:54.680
And so it's a modified MOS 6502 and QuadraScan, which is the high res vector processor that

02:50:54.680 --> 02:50:56.120
Atari developed.

02:50:56.120 --> 02:50:58.760
And it's referred to as an XY display system.

02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:02.760
The digital vector generator is the other term.

02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:10.120
So at any rate, they all came out of science and engineering, which was Atari's off campus

02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:13.320
research lab in Grass Valley, which is not far from us.

02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:14.920
Oh, wow.

02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:16.520
I didn't realize it was there.

02:51:16.520 --> 02:51:17.080
That's cool.

02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:18.040
Yeah.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.560
And of course, that design was first used on Lunar Lander.

02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:33.240
So the modified board had five buttons, 13 sound effects and additional RAM, and it was

02:51:33.240 --> 02:51:34.600
used to develop asteroids.

02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:38.920
The board itself is four by four inches linked up to a monitor.

02:51:40.760 --> 02:51:51.880
So eventually, the prototype, once it existed, different members of the Atari staff, engineers

02:51:51.880 --> 02:51:54.840
would just walk between labs and stop and play the game.

02:51:55.640 --> 02:52:00.120
And people just were getting into it.

02:52:00.120 --> 02:52:05.320
So Atari tested the game first in arcades.

02:52:05.320 --> 02:52:06.120
Guess where, Rob?

02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:09.000
Also near here?

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:09.880
Like here in Zach?

02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:10.920
Sacramento.

02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:12.040
Wow, cool.

02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:14.680
There's a reason why I brought this up.

02:52:16.120 --> 02:52:18.840
And they would basically watch people while they play it.

02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:24.600
Players were...

02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:28.200
I made a complaint they didn't get too much of a break in the game, especially those who

02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:29.560
were used to Space Invaders.

02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:38.440
But what they did is they ended up just making little adjustments to the game.

02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:42.920
So Atari will slow down as you gain 50 to 100 lives.

02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:46.040
But there's no limit on the lives you display.

02:52:46.040 --> 02:52:50.360
You can lose the game if more than 250 lives are collected.

02:52:51.640 --> 02:52:53.800
So let's get on to the home versions.

02:52:54.680 --> 02:53:00.520
Asteroids was released for the Atari VCS, AKA the Atari 2600, and the Atari 8-bit family

02:53:00.520 --> 02:53:02.680
of computers in 1981.

02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:08.440
And then the Atari 7800 in 1986.

02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:10.760
There was a port for the 5200.

02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:12.840
It was supposed to be just like the 8-bit version.

02:53:13.880 --> 02:53:16.040
It was developed in 82 and not published.

02:53:16.040 --> 02:53:19.640
And I do believe that we have a prototype of it.

02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:20.280
One of the...

02:53:20.280 --> 02:53:21.400
We released prototypes.

02:53:22.440 --> 02:53:24.440
I mean, we've got two Atari 5200s.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:30.280
The 7800 version was a launch title and had co-op play.

02:53:30.280 --> 02:53:35.480
And Asteroids had colorful textures, but they did keep the heartbeat sound from the original.

02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:48.280
And basically, though, the programmers who had to get it onto a 4 kilobyte cartridge

02:53:50.040 --> 02:53:50.520
started...

02:53:51.880 --> 02:53:56.520
When they worked on it, they basically made this game the first console to use bank switching.

02:53:57.080 --> 02:54:01.880
So a technique that basically switches a ROM size from 4 kilobytes to 8 kilobytes.

02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:05.000
This game was ridiculously popular.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:15.000
It displaced space invaders, had 70,000 units, earned about 150 million in sales from the game,

02:54:15.640 --> 02:54:19.160
and a further 500 million in coin drops.

02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:28.360
Basically, because it had been based on the Lunar Lander vector thing,

02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:30.360
it actually shipped in Lunar Lander cabinets.

02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:39.240
And then they had to put larger coin boxes in the games to accommodate all the people

02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:42.520
who were spending money on it.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:54.680
It was the highest ranking game on the US replay amusement arcade charts in 1980.

02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:02.280
And it became the highest grossing arcade video game of 1980 in the US after space invaders.

02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:07.080
Now, here's the side thing, though.

02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:09.720
Actually, let me go back a little bit more.

02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:20.280
They did an asteroid deluxe unit that also did fairly well,

02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:25.720
but it was a failure in Japan when it was released in 1980 because of the complex controls.

02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:29.800
And the Japanese market was losing interest in space shooters at the time.

02:55:30.440 --> 02:55:33.960
I mean, I think they just came out of the whole space invaders

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.480
huge craze that was causing the yen shortage.

02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:45.720
But at any rate, it got really good ratings.

02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:46.920
It was really fun.

02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:53.240
It was one of the first games that tracked your initials and allow you to put in your high score.

02:55:55.240 --> 02:55:57.320
It was praised for its vector graphics.

02:55:58.200 --> 02:56:04.600
It was, in 1996, Next Generation listed as number 39 of their top 100 games of all years.

02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:07.480
Retro Gamer put it in the top 25.

02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:12.840
It was added to the Museum of Modern Art's collection of video games.

02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:18.520
The Guardian listed Asteroids as the second greatest game of 1970, just below Galaxian.

02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:27.560
And I mean, it's just got like all kinds of just accolades.

02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:35.880
And also in Saturday Night Live, the characters of Mr. Bill and Sluggo were

02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:44.600
they were referring to the saucers in an Esquire article.

02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:52.840
And so, Lug got a cease and desist letters from a lawyer with the Mr. Bill trademark.

02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:54.760
Very, very silly.

02:56:56.680 --> 02:56:58.440
There were sequels.

02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:05.800
1981, our Asteroids Deluxe came out and the enhancements were made by Dave Shepard

02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:07.320
with Outlog's involvement.

02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:13.080
The objects were tinted blue, hyperspace replaced by a shield that depletes.

02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:17.080
There's a killer satellite, had a holographic backdrop.

02:57:18.120 --> 02:57:20.040
And then after that, there was Space Duel,

02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:26.600
where the rocks were colorful geometric shapes and had co-op two player.

02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:32.280
And then a game that I have covered for a classic game was Blasteroids in 1987.

02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:37.080
They had branching levels and bosses and docking your ships and multiplayer.

02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:40.600
And it was raster graphics instead of vector.

02:57:41.240 --> 02:57:45.720
So for re-releases on the Lynx, we had Super Asteroids and Missile Command.

02:57:46.680 --> 02:57:51.880
Activision released it for many different series in their collections.

02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:56.200
Crave did Asteroids Hyper 64.

02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:01.320
There was a version for by, I think, for the Jaguar.

02:58:02.680 --> 02:58:07.080
Just so many different like game room versions and mobile phone versions

02:58:07.080 --> 02:58:13.560
and just all kinds that are a little bit too many to mention.

02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:19.960
And then we had the clones because back in the day, it was all about send in the clones.

02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:24.520
Quality Software did Asteroids in Space for the Apple II.

02:58:26.360 --> 02:58:29.800
There were Appleoids was another one.

02:58:29.880 --> 02:58:33.160
Mindstorm for the Vetrex, Acornsoft's meteors.

02:58:33.160 --> 02:58:34.840
Moons of Jupiter for the VIC-20.

02:58:35.800 --> 02:58:39.800
Planetoids for the TRS-80.

02:58:41.240 --> 02:58:44.280
Meteor Storm for the Sinclair Zetec Spectrum.

02:58:45.080 --> 02:58:51.000
And another very bad Asteroids clone for the VIC-20 was out there.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:54.280
There's also a Mattel Intellivision game meteor

02:58:54.280 --> 02:58:59.160
that was canceled due to a lawsuit for Asteroids and was reworked as Astro Smash.

02:59:00.200 --> 02:59:02.360
Um, world records.

02:59:03.480 --> 02:59:04.600
Yeah, Twin Galaxies.

02:59:04.600 --> 02:59:06.360
And I'm not going to go with Twin Galaxies, so whatever.

02:59:07.480 --> 02:59:13.080
But I mean, think of all the other games that have come out that are kind of based on that.

02:59:13.080 --> 02:59:16.600
I would wager like Geometry Wars, you know?

02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:17.100
Oh, yeah.

02:59:17.960 --> 02:59:24.920
And you know, one of my favorite games ever of on the ColecoVision is Space Fury.

02:59:24.920 --> 02:59:30.600
One would argue that Space Fury was based off of Asteroids.

02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:33.000
I would say it's definitely based off Asteroids.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:33.500
Yep.

02:59:35.640 --> 02:59:38.360
Just all kinds of games like that, you know?

02:59:38.360 --> 02:59:49.480
And like I was saying, this one paved the way for generations of space motion games, I would say.

02:59:50.440 --> 02:59:59.080
You know, I think without Asteroids, it was the next big thing to push the industry.

02:59:59.080 --> 03:00:03.000
And on top of that, again, it led to very, uh, you know, innovations that we take for

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.400
granted today, like being able to put in your high score.

03:00:06.120 --> 03:00:07.160
That was Asteroids.

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:13.000
So, uh, I'm claiming that for Classic Game and I'm sticking to it.

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.880
No, great pick for the Classic Game of the Week here on our

03:00:16.520 --> 03:00:21.960
20th anniversary show, episode number 920, Asteroids, which many people in chat are kind

03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:25.080
of lighting up saying, this is the first video game I remember playing.

03:00:25.640 --> 03:00:28.680
So it's definitely, definitely a classic in that regard.

03:00:29.480 --> 03:00:30.040
All right.

03:00:30.040 --> 03:00:40.120
I, um, there is somewhere with a picture of me like four years old in like 1980 playing

03:00:40.120 --> 03:00:43.160
an asteroid standing on a stool somewhere out there.

03:00:43.800 --> 03:00:47.560
There's, there's a picture of me like that, but Crystal Castles is the game.

03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:49.560
Yeah.

03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:49.960
All right.

03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:52.520
We're going to skip a couple of segments here.

03:00:52.520 --> 03:00:55.560
We're going to skip our rapid fire news and our world release dates.

03:00:55.560 --> 03:00:59.560
And we're just going to rip, uh, Bernie Stiller.

03:01:00.120 --> 03:01:00.360
Yes.

03:01:00.360 --> 03:01:00.600
Sorry.

03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:02.120
I forgot that was in rapid fire news tonight.

03:01:02.680 --> 03:01:06.920
Um, let's take a look at the, uh, last few headlines here.

03:01:06.920 --> 03:01:08.440
I think Loki, this first one was yours.

03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:09.720
Yep.

03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:14.440
So, uh, the X cloud stuff is getting mouse and keyboard support, which is pretty nice.

03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:17.000
So that's the thing.

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:17.160
Yeah.

03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:18.120
I'm excited to try that.

03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:18.620
That'd be great.

03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:19.720
Yeah.

03:01:19.720 --> 03:01:21.000
Uh, dark Sakura.

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:25.240
I don't know if you can make this one short, but a study on child intelligence involving

03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:25.740
games.

03:01:26.760 --> 03:01:31.880
Um, basically a video games can boost child's intelligent TV and social media had no, uh,

03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:33.960
effects in this way.

03:01:33.960 --> 03:01:38.440
Um, and intelligence is not a constant.

03:01:39.080 --> 03:01:46.360
So it has to be, uh, judged in situational areas and ongoing for it to have a solid measure

03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:46.680
of it.

03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:49.400
So this, uh, study has been going on for a while.

03:01:50.520 --> 03:01:54.040
Uh, Loki, this next one, this is kind of something I want to download and try.

03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:55.240
Yeah.

03:01:55.240 --> 03:01:57.560
Unfortunately, you're probably not going to be able to do that unless you have a modded

03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:04.200
switch system, but, um, some, some crafty modders have made super Mario Odyssey multiplayer.

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:12.840
Um, and it is a 10 player mod that works on modded consoles, allows you to play with a

03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:13.720
bunch of people.

03:02:13.720 --> 03:02:16.600
You can all, um, it's all synced together.

03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:22.040
You can collect moons together and, uh, lots of different custom game modes.

03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:24.280
Nintendo will shut it down immediately.

03:02:24.840 --> 03:02:29.000
This is really something that they should implement in the actual super Mario Odyssey

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:30.760
game, but they'll never do it.

03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:35.240
No, not at this point, but you know, if rumors are true that they're working on a Luigi

03:02:35.240 --> 03:02:40.520
Odyssey or some type of super Mario Odyssey to, you know, listen up clearly fans want

03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:41.000
this, right?

03:02:41.720 --> 03:02:43.080
Yeah, it'd be pretty cool.

03:02:43.080 --> 03:02:47.320
Um, the last story, there was a lot of, uh, press things going around about Final Fantasy

03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:48.680
16, this week's new interviews.

03:02:48.680 --> 03:02:52.520
And one of them was confirmed that, um, Final Fantasy 16 will not be open world.

03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:54.840
Um, but honestly, I don't think that's that big of a deal.

03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:59.800
The only one that was open world was 15 and a lot of people didn't care for 15.

03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:04.520
Um, and you know, if you look at 14, you know, for being in an MMO, it takes place

03:03:04.520 --> 03:03:06.040
in segmented zones.

03:03:06.040 --> 03:03:08.920
And that sounds a lot like what they have planned for 16.

03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:13.640
And at the end of the day, honest to God, creative business unit three fixed Final

03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:18.120
Fantasy 14 and made it one of the greatest games out there right now, especially in the

03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:18.840
MMO space.

03:03:19.640 --> 03:03:21.400
I'm just going to trust them.

03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:25.720
If this is their creative decision for 16, if they've changed the combat so that you

03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:29.000
only play one person and you do have a party, but you don't really use them.

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:29.240
All right.

03:03:29.240 --> 03:03:29.640
You know what?

03:03:30.200 --> 03:03:31.240
I'm going to just hear it out.

03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:35.000
I'm going to, I'm going to see what they bring to the table because, you know, 14 was so

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:35.720
good.

03:03:35.720 --> 03:03:40.600
I'm, I'm willing to give it a chance, but I'm just to see, say the bar, the bar is very

03:03:40.600 --> 03:03:40.840
high.

03:03:41.720 --> 03:03:46.280
Um, we are past the three hour mark tonight, so I'm going to beg that we roll over the,

03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:49.320
um, Twitter and mailbag stuff to next week.

03:03:49.320 --> 03:03:56.520
I will just say big, big thank you to, um, everybody who sent stuff in.

03:03:56.520 --> 03:03:58.200
Uh, I saw the tweets.

03:03:58.200 --> 03:04:01.720
A lot of you were very lovely on Twitter today, and I want to thank you for that.

03:04:02.520 --> 03:04:05.560
I didn't even consider that there were people that wanted to call in tonight.

03:04:05.560 --> 03:04:06.200
Of course they do.

03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:08.200
It's the 20th year and we always do Collins.

03:04:08.200 --> 03:04:11.400
I'm going to, I'm going to do the two minute rule tonight.

03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:13.160
We're doing quick phone calls tonight.

03:04:13.160 --> 03:04:16.200
So you got to introduce yourself and say what you got to say.

03:04:16.200 --> 03:04:17.480
So here we go.

03:04:17.480 --> 03:04:18.920
I'm going to start bringing people in.

03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:24.200
If you want to call in vognetwork.com and slash discord, excuse me, vognetwork.com

03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:28.120
slash discord, and then you can join the green room.

03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:31.400
We'll bring in our first contestant tonight.

03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:31.800
Hi there.

03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:32.760
You're on orange launch radio.

03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:33.240
Who's this?

03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:37.400
Hello there.

03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:39.640
I don't know if you know, I just brought you in the room, but hi, you're on orange

03:04:39.640 --> 03:04:40.040
launch radio.

03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:40.520
Who's this?

03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:43.640
Okay.

03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:44.520
Oh, Nope.

03:04:44.520 --> 03:04:45.000
They left.

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:46.760
So we'll try bringing in someone else.

03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:47.800
Let's try another contestant.

03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:48.760
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:49.240
Who's this?

03:04:49.960 --> 03:04:51.400
This is Brad from pod culture.

03:04:51.400 --> 03:04:52.920
Hey, Brad from pod culture.

03:04:52.920 --> 03:04:55.800
It's great to hear from you the two minute rules in effect tonight.

03:04:55.800 --> 03:04:57.320
So what's on your mind real quick?

03:04:58.840 --> 03:05:01.960
Just calling to say congratulations on 20, man.

03:05:01.960 --> 03:05:02.920
Thank you so much.

03:05:02.920 --> 03:05:05.560
And I know pod culture was a show.

03:05:05.560 --> 03:05:08.040
You're named after a show that you had for a very long time.

03:05:08.920 --> 03:05:13.960
That was no small spring chicken itself.

03:05:13.960 --> 03:05:14.520
You know what I mean?

03:05:14.520 --> 03:05:18.120
It had a great life.

03:05:18.120 --> 03:05:19.080
I miss it, my friend.

03:05:21.320 --> 03:05:27.480
Let's just say that well, OLR inspired kind of the early days of pod culture, and that's

03:05:27.480 --> 03:05:28.360
why I was calling in.

03:05:28.360 --> 03:05:33.080
It's you guys were a huge influence on how we set up the feel of our shows.

03:05:33.080 --> 03:05:37.000
Just three or four friends sitting around shooting the shit about stuff that they like.

03:05:39.720 --> 03:05:46.680
Let's just say there might be something in the works where we can all record virtually.

03:05:46.680 --> 03:05:48.360
I will look forward to it.

03:05:48.360 --> 03:05:48.760
Good luck.

03:05:48.760 --> 03:05:49.320
Pod culture.

03:05:49.320 --> 03:05:50.360
We'll look forward to seeing it.

03:05:50.360 --> 03:05:51.240
Have a good one, my friend.

03:05:51.800 --> 03:05:52.920
Happy anniversary, guys.

03:05:52.920 --> 03:05:53.880
Thank you.

03:05:53.880 --> 03:05:55.160
Thanks for being here all these years.

03:05:55.160 --> 03:05:55.640
All right.

03:05:55.640 --> 03:05:56.040
Bye bye.

03:05:56.040 --> 03:05:56.280
Bye.

03:05:56.760 --> 03:05:57.000
All right.

03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:00.760
Let's try to bring you one more real quick, and we'll see if this works this time.

03:06:00.760 --> 03:06:01.720
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:06:01.720 --> 03:06:02.220
Who's this?

03:06:03.960 --> 03:06:09.000
I think it's actually working this time because Discord decided to mute me when I had everything

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:09.640
all set.

03:06:09.640 --> 03:06:10.840
I mean, what the heck?

03:06:10.840 --> 03:06:11.080
All right.

03:06:11.080 --> 03:06:12.440
Well, the two minute rules in effect tonight.

03:06:12.440 --> 03:06:13.560
So what's on your mind, my friend?

03:06:13.560 --> 03:06:16.360
And it's great to hear and see you DJ Rama S.

03:06:16.360 --> 03:06:17.000
I love your shirt.

03:06:17.640 --> 03:06:17.880
All right.

03:06:17.880 --> 03:06:18.280
Thank you.

03:06:18.280 --> 03:06:21.880
I decided to wear this as an honor for 20 amazing years.

03:06:22.760 --> 03:06:23.720
It's perfect.

03:06:23.720 --> 03:06:24.200
I love it.

03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:30.120
So I'm bringing back our tradition, and I'll make this as quick as possible.

03:06:30.120 --> 03:06:34.280
So I have the first one for Loki.

03:06:34.280 --> 03:06:34.780
I do it.

03:06:35.720 --> 03:06:41.960
The straight man, the voice of reason, the angriest SOB when it comes to gaming.

03:06:41.960 --> 03:06:45.880
So when he gets mad, you sit down, you shut up, and you listen.

03:06:47.400 --> 03:06:49.400
And by the way, Ron must take it a shot.

03:06:49.400 --> 03:06:51.400
And Bobby does have a good point.

03:06:51.400 --> 03:06:53.160
If you're audio only, we don't know what's on the shirt.

03:06:53.240 --> 03:06:54.280
What is on the shirt tonight?

03:06:54.280 --> 03:06:55.720
It's like Sailor Moon fighting.

03:06:56.440 --> 03:06:56.760
Yeah.

03:06:56.760 --> 03:06:59.080
So we all know Marvel versus Capcom.

03:06:59.080 --> 03:07:01.960
And what's popular are these cool types of T shirts.

03:07:01.960 --> 03:07:06.840
This one is a parody of the Marvel versus Capcom fighting select screen, but it's all

03:07:06.840 --> 03:07:11.400
the classic anime series from the 90s and 2000s.

03:07:11.400 --> 03:07:17.960
So currently on my shirt, you have Kenshin Himuro from Rurouni Kenshin and Sailor Moon

03:07:17.960 --> 03:07:21.080
going up against Hikaru from Magic Knight Ray Earth.

03:07:21.080 --> 03:07:23.720
And Yusuke Urameshi from Yu Yu Hockey Show.

03:07:23.720 --> 03:07:24.280
I'd love it.

03:07:26.280 --> 03:07:29.560
We do still call that out in my house from time to time.

03:07:29.560 --> 03:07:31.800
You'll hear Dan just randomly call that out.

03:07:32.840 --> 03:07:33.340
Oh, yeah?

03:07:33.960 --> 03:07:35.400
Because I'm sorry.

03:07:36.920 --> 03:07:37.160
Great.

03:07:37.160 --> 03:07:37.880
Now I can't think of.

03:07:39.720 --> 03:07:40.680
Quabra?

03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:41.180
Yeah.

03:07:41.640 --> 03:07:42.280
That was his guy.

03:07:43.240 --> 03:07:45.400
I always have trouble trying to pronounce his name too.

03:07:46.040 --> 03:07:48.680
No, I couldn't remember his name off the top of my head.

03:07:48.680 --> 03:07:54.360
I was like, something like I'm having my two minute rule.

03:07:54.360 --> 03:07:56.040
And Rama's got some more toast to do.

03:07:56.040 --> 03:07:56.680
I'm sorry.

03:07:56.680 --> 03:07:57.560
I have to be that guy.

03:07:57.560 --> 03:08:01.800
But we're long to this one for Jamie Dark Sakura.

03:08:01.800 --> 03:08:04.680
And I say this in the most lovingly way of possible.

03:08:04.680 --> 03:08:06.280
The head bitch in charge.

03:08:06.280 --> 03:08:09.560
When you hear her talk, if you don't listen, that's your ass.

03:08:11.400 --> 03:08:12.120
Love you bestie.

03:08:12.760 --> 03:08:13.260
Salut.

03:08:14.760 --> 03:08:15.260
L'chaim.

03:08:16.040 --> 03:08:16.540
L'chaim.

03:08:17.320 --> 03:08:22.280
And to Rob, the sassiest motherfucker I have ever met.

03:08:23.400 --> 03:08:23.900
Thank you.

03:08:24.760 --> 03:08:26.840
When you speak, we listen.

03:08:27.880 --> 03:08:31.400
Because the show has become, we just come out and hang out

03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:33.720
and we talk and we have a damn good time.

03:08:33.720 --> 03:08:37.160
So Rob, thanks for everything.

03:08:37.160 --> 03:08:39.320
The fish, the whole nine yards.

03:08:39.320 --> 03:08:41.080
And I remember having a cup like that.

03:08:42.120 --> 03:08:42.760
I adore you.

03:08:44.360 --> 03:08:45.000
The last one.

03:08:45.880 --> 03:08:46.920
Oh, please trust.

03:08:47.480 --> 03:08:48.360
Here's to you.

03:08:48.360 --> 03:08:49.080
Here's to me.

03:08:49.080 --> 03:08:50.600
The best of friends will ever be.

03:08:50.600 --> 03:08:52.120
If we should ever happen to disagree.

03:08:52.120 --> 03:08:53.320
Well, then fuck you.

03:08:53.320 --> 03:08:53.880
And here's to me.

03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:00.120
And now I must bid adieu because I have to get up at 7 a.m.

03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:00.600
For work.

03:09:00.600 --> 03:09:02.360
So good night, Joe.

03:09:02.360 --> 03:09:03.160
Good night, Rama.

03:09:03.880 --> 03:09:04.600
Party without you.

03:09:06.120 --> 03:09:08.920
Anime Jam session, Tuesday nights, 9 p.m.

03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:09.320
Eastern.

03:09:09.320 --> 03:09:09.880
See you then.

03:09:09.880 --> 03:09:10.380
Bye.

03:09:10.760 --> 03:09:11.260
Bye.

03:09:11.260 --> 03:09:11.880
I love this.

03:09:11.880 --> 03:09:12.200
All right.

03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:16.040
Let's just to play the music like the Oscars.

03:09:16.040 --> 03:09:16.920
Pull in a few more.

03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:17.320
Yeah, I know.

03:09:17.320 --> 03:09:17.560
Right.

03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:20.600
Swell the music up as we give people the hook.

03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:21.800
Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio.

03:09:21.800 --> 03:09:22.280
Who's this?

03:09:23.400 --> 03:09:24.760
Hey, this is Mike Deft.

03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:25.560
Mike Deft.

03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:26.440
It's good to hear from you.

03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:29.960
As you know, the two minute rules in effect tonight.

03:09:29.960 --> 03:09:32.200
But it's great to hear what's on your mind.

03:09:32.200 --> 03:09:33.480
I'm going to keep it short.

03:09:33.480 --> 03:09:37.480
And again, I want to thank you or congratulate you first

03:09:37.480 --> 03:09:39.400
for the 20th anniversary.

03:09:40.040 --> 03:09:48.600
And also thank you, each one of you, because, yeah, it's been an amazing 20 years for you.

03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:54.360
I'm obviously haven't been 20 years here, but something I said earlier.

03:09:54.360 --> 03:09:55.880
It feels like you've been here since the beginning.

03:09:55.880 --> 03:09:57.400
But I mean that as a compliment.

03:09:57.400 --> 03:09:57.880
I hope you know.

03:09:58.520 --> 03:09:58.760
Yeah.

03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:05.240
But something I said in chat earlier that the best compliment you can get is basically

03:10:06.200 --> 03:10:10.920
the inspiration you set on other people to do their own thing.

03:10:11.720 --> 03:10:21.000
And I really want to emphasize in that, that if your grandma is doing his podcast,

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:25.960
if I'm doing my podcast, so many people who have inspired over the years.

03:10:25.960 --> 03:10:29.480
And I'm really thankful for being part of our lives.

03:10:30.120 --> 03:10:31.640
Like, it's been amazing.

03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:38.360
And hopefully you can keep doing this at least for a long time, or at least a few years more.

03:10:38.360 --> 03:10:42.040
And again, thanks so much for all you do.

03:10:42.760 --> 03:10:43.800
Thank you so much.

03:10:43.800 --> 03:10:46.920
It truly is the greatest compliment.

03:10:46.920 --> 03:10:49.160
And I said, I'm not going to cry tonight.

03:10:49.160 --> 03:10:50.440
I'm not going to do it.

03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:52.120
But thank you so much for that.

03:10:52.120 --> 03:10:53.160
We can cry, Rob.

03:10:53.160 --> 03:10:54.760
I know, but I'm not going to.

03:10:56.680 --> 03:10:58.040
Do you have no tears left to cry?

03:10:58.040 --> 03:11:01.400
No, by the way, who also shares my birthday today?

03:11:02.200 --> 03:11:02.280
Ariana Grande.

03:11:02.280 --> 03:11:02.920
Thank you very much.

03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:03.960
I'm so honored.

03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:04.280
All right.

03:11:04.280 --> 03:11:05.800
I have Tim Curry, though.

03:11:05.800 --> 03:11:07.720
Deft with the GFM cast.

03:11:07.720 --> 03:11:10.600
Or should I say, hey, F-A-M-A cast, right?

03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:11.000
I say that right.

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:12.200
Hey, F-A-M-A cast.

03:11:12.200 --> 03:11:12.600
Awesome.

03:11:13.080 --> 03:11:13.720
All right.

03:11:13.720 --> 03:11:14.120
Enjoy.

03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:16.520
It's all in Spanish, though.

03:11:16.520 --> 03:11:18.920
So it helps to be able to speak the language.

03:11:18.920 --> 03:11:24.600
I would love to come on your show if I could hang with the language, but I could do a bumper.

03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:26.360
I got Google Translate.

03:11:28.120 --> 03:11:28.440
All right.

03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:29.960
That would be awesome.

03:11:29.960 --> 03:11:30.280
All right.

03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:30.920
Take care, Deft.

03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:31.720
It's great to hear from you.

03:11:32.680 --> 03:11:33.160
Thanks.

03:11:33.160 --> 03:11:33.400
All right.

03:11:33.400 --> 03:11:33.900
Bye-bye.

03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:35.560
All right.

03:11:35.560 --> 03:11:36.520
We got a couple more.

03:11:36.520 --> 03:11:37.160
Last chance.

03:11:37.160 --> 03:11:39.400
Get you a butt in the green room if you want to call in.

03:11:39.400 --> 03:11:41.080
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:41.580
Who's this?

03:11:42.760 --> 03:11:43.880
Hey, this is YYR.

03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:45.080
Hey, YYR.

03:11:45.080 --> 03:11:46.280
It's good to hear from you.

03:11:46.280 --> 03:11:46.760
What's up?

03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:47.160
I'm sorry.

03:11:47.160 --> 03:11:49.160
The two-minute rule is in effect tonight, though.

03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:50.280
Oh, that is just fine.

03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:52.680
I know this is difficult, but you have to keep it short.

03:11:52.680 --> 03:11:53.960
What's on your mind?

03:11:53.960 --> 03:11:54.600
I do.

03:11:54.600 --> 03:11:55.400
I will.

03:11:55.400 --> 03:11:58.520
Listen, first, I just want to say.

03:11:58.520 --> 03:11:59.020
Right.

03:11:59.480 --> 03:12:04.360
Congratulations on 20 years, and I just want to also say thank you.

03:12:05.400 --> 03:12:12.520
I had no idea that when this, you know, a friend of mine named Matt, who you all know as SSJ100Matt,

03:12:13.320 --> 03:12:19.960
told me about this podcast all the way back in 2008 and said, hey, you know, maybe you

03:12:19.960 --> 03:12:22.680
could plug your game Snake 360 on there.

03:12:22.680 --> 03:12:27.960
I had no idea that this would be the start of a beautiful relationship and also just,

03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:32.040
you know, it's entertaining to listen to you guys week in and week out.

03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:33.080
So thank you.

03:12:33.080 --> 03:12:34.440
I really appreciate that.

03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:40.840
But actually, I just wanted to mention, because, you know, a few of the things that have been

03:12:40.840 --> 03:12:44.520
said on the show have led to me creating games.

03:12:45.880 --> 03:12:52.600
And a few times, I've heard something, and my immediate reaction was, I have to do that.

03:12:53.240 --> 03:13:00.360
There is one outstanding moment on this show that I had that reaction to that I have not

03:13:00.360 --> 03:13:04.600
been able to make good on yet, and I figured, hopefully, it'll come through my mic.

03:13:04.600 --> 03:13:06.600
I would like to go ahead and play it.

03:13:07.480 --> 03:13:13.640
It is way back from episode 775 that took place in 2019.

03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:22.840
This part immediately happened after, Rob, you introduced a story about Platinum Games,

03:13:22.840 --> 03:13:27.560
and they were mentioning that they had a couple of projects in development that were too early

03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:33.320
to announce, but they promised they were like nothing that had ever come before, to which

03:13:33.320 --> 03:13:34.440
Loki replied,

03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:09.400
Please, please do not say you are surprise announcing Wrecked Gun here on the show.

03:14:10.600 --> 03:14:15.320
I have nothing to announce yet, but I promise it will be like nothing you've ever seen before.

03:14:17.480 --> 03:14:18.520
Or want to see.

03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:26.200
And with that, I say congratulations once again, and I will bid you adieu.

03:14:27.080 --> 03:14:32.440
You make dreams a reality here at Orange Launch Radio, and I really can't thank you enough,

03:14:33.080 --> 03:14:40.200
even though I'm really about to cuss you out, so I'm going to let you go.

03:14:41.880 --> 03:14:43.800
Have a great night and a great week.

03:14:43.800 --> 03:14:44.280
Take care.

03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:47.480
At least it's not like Gatling cock or something.

03:14:48.040 --> 03:14:49.000
Oh my God.

03:14:50.200 --> 03:14:54.040
We said that on episode 775, and that man remembered.

03:14:54.040 --> 03:14:59.880
Do not blow it out your ass.

03:14:59.880 --> 03:15:00.380
Literally.

03:15:02.040 --> 03:15:03.720
I see it's a very correct.

03:15:04.680 --> 03:15:06.600
Okay, we still have a couple more calls.

03:15:06.600 --> 03:15:07.640
Let's get you and I love it.

03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:10.040
These are names I don't get to see very often, so let's do it.

03:15:10.040 --> 03:15:11.480
Let's bring in another caller.

03:15:11.480 --> 03:15:13.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:13.500
Who's this?

03:15:17.080 --> 03:15:19.160
Oh, oh, hi.

03:15:19.160 --> 03:15:20.280
Hi, it's Orange, right?

03:15:20.280 --> 03:15:20.760
You're here.

03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:21.720
Hey, Orange, right?

03:15:21.720 --> 03:15:22.840
It's good to hear from you.

03:15:22.840 --> 03:15:24.440
I don't think we hear from you a lot.

03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:27.240
Sorry about that.

03:15:28.040 --> 03:15:29.400
No, I know it's very jarring.

03:15:29.400 --> 03:15:30.280
It's like you're sitting in a room.

03:15:31.400 --> 03:15:32.120
This kind of thing.

03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:39.800
I'm watching the Twitch feed and the Discord at the same time, so it's all good.

03:15:39.800 --> 03:15:40.360
All good.

03:15:40.360 --> 03:15:41.960
Well, what is on your mind tonight, my friend?

03:15:41.960 --> 03:15:45.160
Unfortunately, the two minute rules in effect tonight, so I got to keep it quick.

03:15:45.160 --> 03:15:45.660
What's up?

03:15:46.520 --> 03:15:46.840
All right.

03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:52.040
I just wanted to I wish I came in with a real question, but I just wanted to say congratulations

03:15:52.040 --> 03:15:59.240
on the 20 years and thank you for making my Sunday nights that much more special.

03:16:00.040 --> 03:16:01.000
Thank you for being here.

03:16:01.560 --> 03:16:05.320
It wouldn't be so fun if we didn't have the chat room and you've been a huge presence

03:16:05.320 --> 03:16:09.720
in our chat room with your insightful comments and you've got a very rich knowledge about

03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:13.800
a lot of games and you do a lot of live fact checking on the show and I appreciate that.

03:16:14.680 --> 03:16:17.880
It's better to fact check live than get the email the next week.

03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:19.800
Boy, you guys really fucked up that one story.

03:16:19.960 --> 03:16:25.160
It's so nice to have that live and just super appreciate that, my friend.

03:16:26.040 --> 03:16:26.920
Thank you.

03:16:26.920 --> 03:16:27.480
All right.

03:16:27.480 --> 03:16:31.400
Well, Orange Wright, you take care and I hope we hear from you again when we're not running

03:16:31.400 --> 03:16:32.120
three and a half hours.

03:16:32.840 --> 03:16:33.160
All right.

03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:34.760
Take care, my friend.

03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:35.240
Bye bye.

03:16:37.080 --> 03:16:40.760
So I'm intentionally leaving someone in there to be last.

03:16:40.760 --> 03:16:46.440
So just to be clear, I'm not purposely pulling it.

03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:48.760
I'm not purposely letting people jump the line.

03:16:48.760 --> 03:16:51.560
I'm purposely letting having one person have the last word.

03:16:51.560 --> 03:16:54.600
We have another call coming in, though, so let's get to it.

03:16:54.600 --> 03:16:55.160
Hello.

03:16:55.160 --> 03:16:56.200
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:16:56.200 --> 03:16:56.600
Who's this?

03:16:59.240 --> 03:17:05.560
Okay, you might be muted or you're just not realizing we picked you up on Discord yet.

03:17:10.600 --> 03:17:11.000
Hello.

03:17:11.640 --> 03:17:12.120
Hola.

03:17:12.120 --> 03:17:14.360
Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

03:17:16.280 --> 03:17:16.760
Okay.

03:17:16.840 --> 03:17:18.760
We're having some mic trouble.

03:17:18.760 --> 03:17:19.560
Yeah.

03:17:19.560 --> 03:17:22.760
Hey, call us next week because I would love to hear from you.

03:17:23.880 --> 03:17:27.320
All right, let's get to the last call.

03:17:28.760 --> 03:17:29.320
This is it.

03:17:31.160 --> 03:17:32.680
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:17:32.680 --> 03:17:33.160
Who's this?

03:17:36.360 --> 03:17:38.920
No, don't tell me they don't know their mics on or not here.

03:17:38.920 --> 03:17:39.560
Hello.

03:17:39.560 --> 03:17:40.760
If you hear me, you're on the air.

03:17:40.760 --> 03:17:48.200
Ah, I don't know how to.

03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:49.560
What are we?

03:17:49.560 --> 03:17:51.640
Are we doing something wrong where, like, people don't know?

03:17:51.640 --> 03:17:53.960
Like, it's probably not like beeping or something like that.

03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:55.560
So let me see.

03:17:58.920 --> 03:18:01.480
I'm gonna just ping them in chat, see if they.

03:18:04.120 --> 03:18:05.320
He's not muted.

03:18:05.320 --> 03:18:07.080
No, it's not muted on Discord.

03:18:07.080 --> 03:18:08.120
Unless it's a hard mute.

03:18:08.120 --> 03:18:10.200
So for whatever reason, the mic isn't picking it up.

03:18:11.480 --> 03:18:13.080
All right.

03:18:14.360 --> 03:18:14.760
You know what?

03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:18.520
We have a return.

03:18:19.640 --> 03:18:21.960
We are going to deposit you back in the green room and try

03:18:21.960 --> 03:18:22.520
one more time.

03:18:23.720 --> 03:18:24.200
Okay.

03:18:24.200 --> 03:18:26.200
Meanwhile, let's try this.

03:18:26.200 --> 03:18:27.320
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:18:27.320 --> 03:18:27.820
Who's this?

03:18:28.280 --> 03:18:29.480
This is Drew.

03:18:29.480 --> 03:18:29.960
Drew.

03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:31.160
It's good to hear from you.

03:18:31.160 --> 03:18:31.960
You got it to work.

03:18:31.960 --> 03:18:33.320
What's up, my friend?

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:37.640
What'd you say?

03:18:37.640 --> 03:18:39.720
Haven't seen you in a long time.

03:18:40.760 --> 03:18:42.920
Thank God we're in a virtual environment now.

03:18:42.920 --> 03:18:45.320
So you can't break anything.

03:18:47.400 --> 03:18:48.680
That you know of.

03:18:48.680 --> 03:18:49.880
I'm breaking hearts every day.

03:18:49.880 --> 03:18:50.680
What are you talking about?

03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:54.120
Drew, I have to ask you something, and I don't want to hear

03:18:54.120 --> 03:18:57.080
the answer to this, but I'm gonna ask this question anyway,

03:18:57.080 --> 03:18:58.360
and I'm gonna be very upset.

03:18:59.320 --> 03:19:00.280
How old are you now?

03:19:02.680 --> 03:19:05.000
Just a little less older than the show.

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:05.640
No, I'm kidding.

03:19:07.080 --> 03:19:08.360
Do you really want the answer?

03:19:09.080 --> 03:19:10.280
Unfortunately, yes.

03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:15.800
Ah, I share a birthday with good old Orange Lounge Radio.

03:19:15.800 --> 03:19:17.320
So I am now 37.

03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:18.760
Row.

03:19:22.840 --> 03:19:23.160
Hello.

03:19:23.160 --> 03:19:23.480
Hello.

03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:27.560
Yes, in a total row.

03:19:27.560 --> 03:19:28.840
Yes, there you go.

03:19:28.840 --> 03:19:30.680
And he's going to be in a total row about it.

03:19:32.120 --> 03:19:35.720
I remember this kid was like 21 the first time he came on

03:19:35.720 --> 03:19:36.200
OLR.

03:19:36.920 --> 03:19:37.800
Oh, Jesus.

03:19:37.800 --> 03:19:39.880
I was younger than that when you were.

03:19:42.760 --> 03:19:47.000
Oh, you have made those so much progress, and I'm ridiculously

03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:47.560
proud of you.

03:19:48.680 --> 03:19:50.920
All right, you have.

03:19:50.920 --> 03:19:52.360
Good God, you've come a long way.

03:19:54.520 --> 03:19:55.240
And I got the right.

03:19:57.800 --> 03:19:59.240
So let me ask this.

03:19:59.240 --> 03:20:00.280
The two minute rules in effect.

03:20:00.280 --> 03:20:00.760
I'm so sorry.

03:20:00.760 --> 03:20:02.520
I'd love to talk to you longer, but quickly.

03:20:03.480 --> 03:20:08.040
What do you want to tell people about the old days of OLR?

03:20:08.040 --> 03:20:09.800
Because believe it or not, we have a lot of newer listeners

03:20:09.800 --> 03:20:10.520
because of Twitch and all that.

03:20:10.520 --> 03:20:13.560
So not everybody was here back in the Rob's Garage day and

03:20:13.560 --> 03:20:14.520
things like that.

03:20:14.520 --> 03:20:17.080
What's like a memory from the old OLR, something people

03:20:17.080 --> 03:20:17.800
should know about it?

03:20:18.680 --> 03:20:19.480
Oh, my God.

03:20:20.920 --> 03:20:26.120
If there's any one mascot there that screams OLR or rather

03:20:26.120 --> 03:20:28.760
chirps OLR, it is that old bush baby ferret.

03:20:29.720 --> 03:20:32.840
And I know it's been a very, very, very long time since

03:20:32.840 --> 03:20:34.680
that same thing has been on the airwaves.

03:20:36.840 --> 03:20:40.120
That thing doesn't even work anymore, but I have it.

03:20:40.120 --> 03:20:41.720
It ended up in a wood chipper.

03:20:41.720 --> 03:20:44.120
No, it was this little thing that made a noise that said,

03:20:44.120 --> 03:20:44.760
Excuse me.

03:20:45.320 --> 03:20:48.520
No, because Loki found like a store that had like five more.

03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:51.080
And I remember he dumped a whole box out one episode.

03:20:51.080 --> 03:20:54.120
I think Angel or one of our other fans took one.

03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:57.240
One of them got on the Grotto Mori.

03:20:57.240 --> 03:20:57.960
Oh, yeah, that's right.

03:20:57.960 --> 03:21:00.680
One of them got stuck on the Katamari at E3 that one year.

03:21:00.680 --> 03:21:02.040
That was fucking funny.

03:21:02.040 --> 03:21:03.960
So at E3, they were hyping.

03:21:03.960 --> 03:21:06.840
I think the sequel was like beautiful Katamari or one of

03:21:06.840 --> 03:21:09.320
those games, and they actually had a Katamari you could stick

03:21:09.320 --> 03:21:09.880
things to.

03:21:09.880 --> 03:21:13.480
And one of those ferrets ended up on the fucking Katamari

03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:14.760
they had at E3.

03:21:14.760 --> 03:21:17.160
That's probably sitting in a Namco office somewhere now or

03:21:17.160 --> 03:21:17.720
a dumpster.

03:21:17.720 --> 03:21:18.220
Who knows?

03:21:19.160 --> 03:21:22.280
But just in case y'all thought that everybody was entirely

03:21:22.280 --> 03:21:24.920
serious all the time, even back then, ferrets.

03:21:25.240 --> 03:21:26.600
Every time.

03:21:27.720 --> 03:21:29.880
Check out Bungie Ferret Tossing on 360.

03:21:29.880 --> 03:21:31.160
Somebody made a game about that.

03:21:31.160 --> 03:21:33.480
Just I don't know if you were here for that, but it's pretty

03:21:33.480 --> 03:21:36.120
wild how things came full circle.

03:21:36.120 --> 03:21:37.080
You have a hand in that?

03:21:38.200 --> 03:21:39.560
No, this is all YYR.

03:21:40.760 --> 03:21:43.560
I think we might have done voices or something, but there's

03:21:43.560 --> 03:21:46.840
pictures of our pets in there that sadly, some of them have

03:21:46.840 --> 03:21:47.480
left this realm.

03:21:47.480 --> 03:21:49.640
But yeah, because it's kind of an older game at this point.

03:21:50.680 --> 03:21:53.000
All right, Drew, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up.

03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:54.760
We're seriously at the three and a half hour point.

03:21:55.160 --> 03:21:55.960
Take care, my friend.

03:21:56.760 --> 03:21:57.160
You too.

03:21:57.160 --> 03:21:58.280
Congratulations, y'all.

03:21:58.280 --> 03:21:58.760
Thank you.

03:21:58.760 --> 03:21:59.160
Thanks.

03:21:59.160 --> 03:22:00.280
Thanks for being a part of it.

03:22:00.920 --> 03:22:01.480
Take care.

03:22:01.480 --> 03:22:02.920
Proud to be real.

03:22:04.120 --> 03:22:05.000
37.

03:22:07.160 --> 03:22:08.040
37.

03:22:11.080 --> 03:22:14.040
Let's try one more time with this last caller tonight.

03:22:14.040 --> 03:22:14.600
Hello.

03:22:14.600 --> 03:22:16.760
You are on Orange Lawn's radio.

03:22:16.760 --> 03:22:17.240
Who's this?

03:22:20.520 --> 03:22:22.440
Oh, no, I think it's still broken.

03:22:22.440 --> 03:22:26.440
And I just I don't know if this individual can hear us.

03:22:26.440 --> 03:22:28.920
It's a bummer, because back in the Skype days, we used to say

03:22:28.920 --> 03:22:31.000
call Echo 123 to test your connection.

03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:32.920
There's nothing like that on Discord, so we kind of have to

03:22:32.920 --> 03:22:34.440
figure this stuff out live.

03:22:34.440 --> 03:22:38.600
So I'm going to try one more time.

03:22:40.280 --> 03:22:43.880
See if this person can, because I don't know if Discord

03:22:43.880 --> 03:22:45.640
always beeps in your ear.

03:22:45.640 --> 03:22:49.080
So if you and what I'm worried people might be doing is that

03:22:49.080 --> 03:22:54.440
they're muting Discord and listening on Twitch.

03:22:54.440 --> 03:22:57.000
And so they don't hear that they got brought into the room.

03:22:57.560 --> 03:22:59.960
Oh, the camera's switching.

03:22:59.960 --> 03:23:03.000
So maybe it's getting figured out.

03:23:05.240 --> 03:23:05.800
Who knows?

03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:09.800
But Bobby says they do have Discord settings to test your

03:23:09.800 --> 03:23:12.600
device. It records and it plays audio back to you.

03:23:15.560 --> 03:23:17.560
My heart is breaking, but I don't think it's working.

03:23:18.520 --> 03:23:22.280
It's just we're getting the spinning hourglass wheel.

03:23:23.400 --> 03:23:25.880
Man. Bummer.

03:23:27.080 --> 03:23:27.960
All right.

03:23:27.960 --> 03:23:29.240
I'm sorry, Dark Tetsuya.

03:23:29.240 --> 03:23:31.880
I would love to hear from you and let you have the final word.

03:23:31.880 --> 03:23:32.840
Oh, it's trying one more time.

03:23:33.640 --> 03:23:35.000
I'm worried if it even gets through.

03:23:37.240 --> 03:23:37.480
No.

03:23:39.320 --> 03:23:40.280
I see it spinning.

03:23:40.280 --> 03:23:41.080
It hating.

03:23:41.080 --> 03:23:41.880
Yeah, it's hating.

03:23:41.880 --> 03:23:43.320
I'm sorry, Dark Tetsuya.

03:23:43.320 --> 03:23:45.720
Yeah, he said his internet wasn't working right properly

03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:49.880
either, but I'm sure you understand it is live radio and

03:23:49.880 --> 03:23:50.920
we've got to wrap it up.

03:23:50.920 --> 03:23:52.120
We're at the three and a half hour mark.

03:23:52.120 --> 03:23:55.000
Please send in your thoughts and just know I saved you for

03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:56.920
last because I know you've been here since the very first

03:23:56.920 --> 03:23:59.080
episode. I wanted you to be the final voice tonight.

03:23:59.640 --> 03:24:02.840
It's a bummer technology sucks, but thank you for all that

03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:05.000
you've done over the years for us, my friend.

03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:07.240
And we'll see you next week.

03:24:07.240 --> 03:24:08.760
I hope we see everybody next week.

03:24:08.760 --> 03:24:12.120
I know we've had a long, long show tonight, but we've had a

03:24:12.120 --> 03:24:13.560
long history.

03:24:14.360 --> 03:24:19.240
It's been 20 years of this, and thank you all for your

03:24:19.240 --> 03:24:19.640
support.

03:24:20.360 --> 03:24:21.320
I can't even.

03:24:21.320 --> 03:24:21.640
I know.

03:24:21.640 --> 03:24:22.280
I can't even.

03:24:22.280 --> 03:24:25.560
It's one of those things where, like, I can't even like

03:24:25.560 --> 03:24:27.720
I hear, Oh, we've been going for 20 years.

03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:30.600
I have a hard time even, like, conceptualizing, like, what

03:24:30.600 --> 03:24:33.400
it is or even though I'm like, I'm living it.

03:24:33.400 --> 03:24:35.240
It's weird to think like, Oh, 20 years.

03:24:35.240 --> 03:24:35.560
Wow.

03:24:38.760 --> 03:24:40.360
It's wild.

03:24:40.360 --> 03:24:41.240
It is.

03:24:41.240 --> 03:24:42.840
It's absolutely intense.

03:24:42.840 --> 03:24:43.160
It is.

03:24:44.840 --> 03:24:47.400
Well, what do I say here at the end as we start to recap

03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:49.880
tonight? Thank you all for being a part of this, whether

03:24:49.880 --> 03:24:52.440
it was just tonight, whether it's been for the last 20

03:24:52.440 --> 03:24:54.760
years, whether it's been for the last 20 minutes.

03:24:56.520 --> 03:24:58.600
I just want to say thank you so much for being a part of

03:24:58.600 --> 03:24:59.720
Orange Launch Radio.

03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:01.560
Thanks for being a part of this family and our Sunday

03:25:01.560 --> 03:25:05.560
night little gathering here and playing a part in it.

03:25:07.640 --> 03:25:10.200
So many dreams have really come true because of this show

03:25:10.200 --> 03:25:13.800
as talking about earlier, getting to do E3 in the beginning,

03:25:13.800 --> 03:25:17.080
getting games and cameos and video games because of this

03:25:17.080 --> 03:25:19.080
show, getting to meet people.

03:25:19.080 --> 03:25:20.360
I travel to cities.

03:25:21.960 --> 03:25:23.720
I don't want to say around the world because I'm not quite

03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:25.880
that well traveled by travel to cities around the US and

03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:28.920
Canada and any city I go to.

03:25:28.920 --> 03:25:32.040
It's like I know somebody here, and if it's not because of

03:25:32.040 --> 03:25:35.240
OLR directly, it's because somebody I met because of OLR

03:25:35.240 --> 03:25:36.280
and that whole sort of thing.

03:25:36.280 --> 03:25:39.400
And just the impact that the show has had is just incredible.

03:25:39.480 --> 03:25:41.320
And the opportunities I've been given to do things like

03:25:41.320 --> 03:25:44.840
panels at Dragon Con, which has led to other big things.

03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:46.600
It's just incredible.

03:25:46.600 --> 03:25:49.080
And I don't know what else to say, but thank you for being

03:25:49.080 --> 03:25:49.640
a part of it.

03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:52.680
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

03:25:52.680 --> 03:25:54.120
tell a friend or two about the show.

03:25:54.120 --> 03:25:55.960
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every

03:25:55.960 --> 03:25:58.280
gamer has a voice, but we need more voices.

03:25:58.280 --> 03:25:58.600
Always.

03:25:58.600 --> 03:25:59.880
We're still in search of new voices.

03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:03.160
Let's get some more.

03:26:03.160 --> 03:26:04.360
Let's get some new faces.

03:26:04.360 --> 03:26:05.480
We love the old faces too.

03:26:05.480 --> 03:26:08.120
Let's get some new faces for some new opinions as we move

03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:12.200
into our 21st year starting next week and approaching the

03:26:12.200 --> 03:26:13.080
legal drinking age.

03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:17.400
Let's go around to get everybody's final thoughts tonight.

03:26:18.040 --> 03:26:19.240
Loki, I will start with you.

03:26:19.240 --> 03:26:19.960
Your final thought.

03:26:20.760 --> 03:26:23.000
My final thought is I would like to remind everybody that

03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:28.280
the Steam Summer Sale is going on right now and certain YYR

03:26:28.280 --> 03:26:32.520
games and a certain game about, you know, poop and NES and

03:26:32.520 --> 03:26:34.360
stuff may be on sale right now.

03:26:34.360 --> 03:26:36.040
Also on itch.io is also on sale.

03:26:36.600 --> 03:26:39.960
So check out Pixel Poops number two for $6.99.

03:26:40.920 --> 03:26:42.520
Way to bury the lead.

03:26:42.520 --> 03:26:43.720
You should have said that at the start.

03:26:43.720 --> 03:26:46.440
But no, I hope you sell lots.

03:26:49.640 --> 03:26:52.200
Dark Sakura, I know you're still going to do some Debbie

03:26:52.200 --> 03:26:53.720
tonight, even with the long run time.

03:26:53.720 --> 03:26:54.920
What is your final thought tonight?

03:26:56.120 --> 03:26:57.400
Reject false icons.

03:26:58.280 --> 03:26:59.160
What a throwback.

03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:00.040
Have a good night, Jamie.

03:27:00.600 --> 03:27:01.960
Have a good stream later.

03:27:01.960 --> 03:27:02.600
Later, Tater.

03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:05.000
And then my final thought tonight.

03:27:08.200 --> 03:27:09.320
I'm 44 today.

03:27:09.320 --> 03:27:11.560
We haven't talked a lot about the fact that it is my birthday

03:27:11.560 --> 03:27:13.400
because we're focusing on OLR's birthday right now.

03:27:14.360 --> 03:27:16.920
I was supposed to be in Europe today.

03:27:16.920 --> 03:27:18.360
Yes, I was going to miss this show.

03:27:18.360 --> 03:27:21.240
We would have just had the 20th anniversary be next week or

03:27:21.240 --> 03:27:21.800
something.

03:27:21.800 --> 03:27:24.360
But I was originally going to be in Europe today because I

03:27:24.360 --> 03:27:27.080
was going to see ABBA Voyage, which if you know me, you know

03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:28.760
I'm a huge ABBA stan.

03:27:28.760 --> 03:27:29.560
I love them.

03:27:29.560 --> 03:27:31.560
And seeing Voyage would have been like the closest thing to

03:27:31.560 --> 03:27:32.920
actually seeing them live.

03:27:32.920 --> 03:27:34.840
It didn't work out that way.

03:27:34.840 --> 03:27:38.360
Just because since I bought the tickets that have now gone

03:27:38.360 --> 03:27:41.960
to waste with it away, I got diagnosed with diabetes.

03:27:42.840 --> 03:27:46.040
We bought the house, but we weren't able to get as much help

03:27:46.040 --> 03:27:48.120
on the house as we were originally going to get because

03:27:48.120 --> 03:27:49.000
of some family things.

03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:49.800
That's all I'm going to say.

03:27:51.400 --> 03:27:52.760
And just some things happen.

03:27:52.760 --> 03:27:55.080
And so the Europe trip wasn't able to happen this time.

03:27:57.160 --> 03:27:57.960
But that's okay.

03:27:57.960 --> 03:27:59.560
Things have a way of working out.

03:27:59.560 --> 03:28:01.880
And I'm really trying to be thankful for the things I do

03:28:01.880 --> 03:28:08.360
have. Great job, great health under control now that I know

03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:09.080
what's going on.

03:28:10.600 --> 03:28:17.480
And this and all of you that give a shit and go the extra

03:28:17.480 --> 03:28:18.600
mile with this every week.

03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:21.560
I'm very thankful for that.

03:28:21.560 --> 03:28:24.920
And it gives me a lot to be happy about on my birthday today

03:28:24.920 --> 03:28:26.200
as well as OLR's birthday.

03:28:26.200 --> 03:28:26.760
So thank you.

03:28:27.400 --> 03:28:30.360
And to kind of piggyback on something that was said earlier

03:28:30.360 --> 03:28:32.520
in the show, I don't feel 44.

03:28:33.240 --> 03:28:34.360
Do I look 44?

03:28:34.360 --> 03:28:35.320
Don't answer that.

03:28:35.320 --> 03:28:36.680
I don't feel 44.

03:28:36.680 --> 03:28:37.640
I still feel young.

03:28:37.640 --> 03:28:42.200
And I think if this show does go until I'm 64, probably not

03:28:42.200 --> 03:28:43.880
going to realize it then either.

03:28:43.880 --> 03:28:51.000
So yeah, I don't know what else to say for the first time

03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:52.360
in a 20 year history.

03:28:52.360 --> 03:28:53.240
I'm out of words.

03:28:55.160 --> 03:28:56.200
Thank you, everyone.

03:28:56.200 --> 03:28:57.000
We'll see you next week.

03:28:57.000 --> 03:28:58.280
Have a wonderful night.

03:28:58.280 --> 03:28:58.760
Good night.

03:29:26.200 --> 03:29:28.280
But you know they were all still true.

03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:32.280
See you next week.
