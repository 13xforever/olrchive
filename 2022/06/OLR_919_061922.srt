1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,620
Do you hear that? All that furious typing? No? Right! Because the pace of news is down

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,960
and the media's summer holiday started. At least until summer game sales and listicles

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
start getting churned out. But don't worry, it's never a completely quiet week. The

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,400
evergreen topics live up to their name, new collections, new legals, and bad decisions.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,640
Enough to fill time. Sort of like what I'm doing for this intro.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,660
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to bring you the news

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,000
we do have. Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,300
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:51,200
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:59,440
number 919 of our show for tonight, June 19 of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:07,800
am joined as always by my co-hosts for the last 19.90 years because next week is a big

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,440
number. First off, we have DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

13
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
Hi.

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Hi, how are you?

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,200
I'm all right. How are you?

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,600
I'm doing good. I was just obviously listening to Jason's intro and kind of laughing at

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,040
that. It's a slow news week to this week in the gaming world. You know, we're coming

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,120
off that not E3 period and the, you know, summer breaks and things. And there's a few

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:37,440
things to talk about, but not a ton. And so, yeah, there's that. And then, so on top of

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,480
that, then I'm thinking in the real world, there's actually a lot going on today. Juneteenth

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,320
is today. Happy Juneteenth. Father's Day. Happy Father's Day to anybody that that applies

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,600
to. Pride Month's still going on. It's probably somebody's birthday. What am I forgetting?

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,920
There's a lot going on today. So busy, busy June 19th. So I'm happy, happy everything

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,520
to all of you out there and play some video games to celebrate. Also want to say hello

25
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,760
to Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki. Who for some reason I'm not hearing tonight. I don't know

26
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,080
if it just cut out for a second.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Made it, that's right.

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,640
OK, you see, you got me thinking it's on my end. How are you doing, Loki?

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm doing fine.

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,560
Good. So, yeah, there's a lot of a lot of weird tech odd stuff going on, and that is

31
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,760
because I'm running on a new computer tonight.

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,760
During the week this week, I actually got a new to me computer.

33
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,480
I haven't upgraded my computer in the last five years.

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,720
And Alan was very much like, I don't want to build a new computer because especially I

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,800
don't want to do two.

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,080
Can we just buy like a pre-build?

37
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,720
And I was like, sure, let's do it.

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,080
Let's buy a pre-build computer.

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,160
And so we got matching computers from one of those pre-build companies.

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,080
They didn't give it to me for free, so I'm not giving them an ad.

41
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,080
It depends on what you consider expensive.

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
I'll text you later.

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,400
I'm not really comfortable saying the budget on air because, you know, it's yeah, some

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,160
people are that's I've wanted to know relative to your to your ideas.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,480
Yeah, yeah, it's I would say it was on the pricier end.

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,840
What we did, but we had some some work bonus type things, PTO cash out that we were able

47
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,480
to do to make it work.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,760
So, yeah, so, yeah, we were able to do that.

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,240
And actually, it's funny because Bobby Black Wolf actually helped before us here on O.L.R.

50
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,160
because Alan, you know, he is more of a tech mindset, but he wanted a second pair of eyes

51
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,960
and he's like, who else like builds computer stuff?

52
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,360
And I mean, we know a lot of people that do that stuff.

53
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,560
But, you know, it really gets into the weeds of that stuff.

54
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,760
And so he thought of Bobby and I guess Bobby did give the computers his blessing.

55
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,640
So whereas the new computer stuff is great and actually OBS with the import export

56
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,800
functionality of the scenes made it really easy to carry most of the show stuff over.

57
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,000
The audio stuff is really a little bit of a mess tonight.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,040
And what I'm also learning just now for the first time, a bad mistake I made.

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,640
Oops, I forgot to install the stream deck software.

60
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,680
But that's not very big or a long install.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,320
No, it's not. And I only really, really, really need it for one thing.

62
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,640
And that is the little sidebar that shows when we're live on Twitch, because we do tape

63
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,040
live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash vog network, the Voice of Geeks network,

64
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,360
nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

65
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,000
And the only thing I really need it for, I can control the scenes if I need to on my list

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,640
in OBS, but I use it for the up and down for the right bar.

67
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,680
Now, I do know of and Bobby is probably typing in chat right now, the plan B for that.

68
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,840
I do know there is one.

69
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,880
It's just a lot. It's a lot less convenient, but that's probably what I'll just have to do

70
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
for the night until I can actually.

71
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,800
But I knew it's those little things like that I was going to discover as we were going on

72
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,160
through the show tonight.

73
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,360
Looking in chat, Bobby Black Wolf says, Alan gave me the three finalists and I told him I

74
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,280
won two and three.

75
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,560
Yes, they played the computer dating game, basically, which was nice.

76
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,520
And Quest Buster says pricey right now, but that's an investment for the years ahead.

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,520
Absolutely.

78
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,920
And I'm going to be perfectly honest.

79
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,200
We're new homeowners and we kind of had a discussion.

80
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,600
We could really use a new kitchen table, but do we want a new kitchen table right now or is

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,120
the one that we're using good enough?

82
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,960
And honestly, we kind of need new computers because the computers are what we use more

83
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,160
than anything.

84
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,880
And I think Alan has been feeling a little bit creatively stagnant because he was streaming

85
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,120
on Twitch for a long time.

86
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
He stopped for the last little bit.

87
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,440
And I think it's because he was getting frustrated, like the technical limitations of the

88
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,560
computer. And, you know, he can't stream things like Elden Ring because the computer he had

89
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,960
wouldn't run it. Well, trust me, this new one will run it and he can stream it if he

90
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,640
wants whenever he decides to get back up and running with that.

91
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,440
So the same goes for me, really, is I don't have to rely on my Xbox Series X to stream

92
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,280
everything. I should be able to do a lot more on the PC.

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,400
On that note, I also saw in chat over Twitch.tv slash Vaga Network, somebody had

94
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,920
suggested, oh, you should start streaming OLR in 1080p.

95
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,800
And actually, I did have this, actually, no, it was Alan that said that early on.

96
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,600
I did have that same thought early on because I was like, oh, that would be fun.

97
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,960
But here's the thing.

98
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,240
Because we aren't partner, Twitch doesn't down sample the stream for everyone else.

99
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,320
So if I broadcast at 1080, everybody would be forced to watch at 1080.

100
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,320
And that might not work with your bandwidth and your Wi-Fi and the way many of you tune

101
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,800
into the show on Sunday nights.

102
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,240
It wouldn't affect anybody on the podcast feed, but I want to be mindful of those that

103
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,640
are here on Sunday nights as well.

104
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,040
And so that's why I chose not to go that route.

105
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,880
However, I did bump it back up to 60 frames a second.

106
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,200
We were only on 30 frames a second, and I'm not sure 60 frames is going to change that

107
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,280
much. But there you go.

108
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,440
I did throw that little, but we're going to still be in 720p for a little bit.

109
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:15,400
So Bobby actually does say, oh, Twitch does down sample, but it's not guaranteed.

110
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,960
And that's honestly the lack of guarantee is enough for me because the one night I

111
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,960
decide to do 1080p, it'll be, oh, say the 20th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.

112
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,360
And then people are saying, I can't hear it.

113
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,040
I can't hear it. The show's a flop.

114
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,520
And all that stuff.

115
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,880
So, all right.

116
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,880
Anyhow, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

117
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,640
There's a lot of stuff going on in gaming.

118
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,120
No, there's not. But we're going to pretend there is.

119
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,840
There's a couple big headlines, at least.

120
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,480
So let's get into the big headlines and we'll start with tonight's kickoff topic.

121
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,360
We'll go over to Loki, who's going to start us off tonight.

122
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:01,560
Yeah, so they did a this is kind of the second part of key three, the not E3 event

123
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,360
that takes place around Summer Game Fest, but Square Enix had their Final Fantasy 7

124
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,480
25th anniversary live stream and they announced stuff for that.

125
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,960
So, of course, the next being the next part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake, which is now

126
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,240
Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and it's continuing on the story there.

127
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,880
And then they said that's going to be coming out, I believe next fall.

128
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,720
And along with that, they confirmed that it is a three part series that's going to be

129
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,200
which kind of we figure as much since the first part kind of took place.

130
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,320
Which, you know, back in the original version of it, like the first disc of the of the game.

131
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,320
So, you know, they're they're going to make it three parts.

132
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,960
And then along with that, of course, we've got them remaking the.

133
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,880
Was that Final Fantasy seven crisis core is going to be remade as well, and that's coming

134
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,840
out this year.

135
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,520
So this fall, which is kind of interesting.

136
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,440
But yeah, I mean, it looks good.

137
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,720
I need to finish playing through it.

138
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,040
Oh, you never finished the remake?

139
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,360
I didn't.

140
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,080
Oh, it's so good.

141
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,880
Well, I have.

142
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,360
OK, so here's the thing.

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,560
People have been calling this game Final Fantasy seven remake part two.

144
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,480
And now we know that that isn't really going to be the name.

145
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,280
And it's some of the takes on social media have me kind of wondering who's got a hot take

146
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,160
that actually hasn't played the Final Fantasy seven remake, because I'm going to tell you

147
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,240
what I believe is a minor plot spoiler.

148
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,800
But at this point, Loki, I'm sorry, it's been out for two years.

149
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,160
I feel if the plot points are sensitive, you would have played it by now.

150
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,880
Here's the thing.

151
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,080
If you play through the game, the whole gag about it being a remake is a plot point.

152
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,360
And the fact that the game there is a certain legacy and a certain set of rules that the

153
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,160
game feels like it has to live up to, and there comes a very clear part in the game where

154
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,000
the game says we are going to deviate from this.

155
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,280
And what happens is that a major character is killed who is not supposed to be killed.

156
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,040
And what happens is that basically a outside force and I'm not going to get into everything

157
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,760
kind of rewinds that incident so that that doesn't happen, because when that originally

158
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:37,480
happens, it's like a what the fuck moment, because that person doesn't die.

159
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,920
For what you know, but that was the game setting the rules to say, this is not the same Final

160
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,640
Fantasy 7 you knew.

161
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,600
This is a Final Fantasy 7 multi, I would say this whole multiverse phenomenon that we've

162
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,440
seen with the Doctor Strange, everything everywhere all at once.

163
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,400
This is really what Final Fantasy 7 is kind of at now is that this is a Final Fantasy 7

164
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:08,760
separate, Final Fantasy 7 separate universe where a different series of events has taken

165
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,320
place.

166
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,280
And it kind of compounds that when you get towards the end of the game and a series of

167
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,600
events that happens at the end of the game that kind of shows like, wait a minute now, and

168
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,200
this is why it's important that Crisis Core is coming out again, because there's a series of

169
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,720
events where it's like, wait a minute, this isn't the way it played out in Final Fantasy 7.

170
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,680
So yes, fifth dream in chat says, then it's a redo, not a remake.

171
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Absolutely.

172
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,000
And I think a really appropriate way to phrase it is that it's a rebirth.

173
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,000
And that's why I think this title that they have for part two is super appropriate, because it's

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,560
Final Fantasy 7 rebirth.

175
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,000
And so everybody's asking, well, is Aerith going to die?

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,920
Is Aerith going to die?

177
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,480
It's not guaranteed.

178
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,360
I don't think she will.

179
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,120
Well, I'm not sure.

180
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,920
I'm not so sure I'm going to hedge my bets on that.

181
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,320
They'll kill her and then they'll rewind time again and kill her again.

182
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,880
Maybe.

183
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,680
I don't know.

184
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,160
And I think now that's the big question mark is, is the game going to play out the way we expect

185
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,560
it to?

186
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,280
Because the answer is already no.

187
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,120
And so everything is up for renegotiation.

188
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,200
Every, you know, and there's this whole fact that, like, you know, you had the whole side story, the

189
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,040
DLC, which, to be fair, I have not played through.

190
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,880
But we all know that Yuffie was not in the original game early on in the Midgar component, but they

191
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,400
introduced her here in like a side.

192
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,160
Meanwhile, in another part of the galaxy, I thought there was a way to get her in Midgar.

193
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,840
Like there was like a little playground area that there's a very small chance to get her.

194
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,560
I thought.

195
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,160
Maybe, but we'll just say unintentionally.

196
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,080
That's not like or like that's not really the way most people experience that game.

197
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,400
Right.

198
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,600
And so it's very different in this remake.

199
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,720
So I just I think we need to stop calling this the Final Fantasy seven remake series, because if you

200
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,400
played the first game, you already know this is not a shot for shot remake.

201
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:21,400
And I thought I quite frankly, I thought it was quite frankly genius in the game that they made the

202
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,120
expectations of doing a remake of Final Fantasy seven a plot point.

203
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,640
Because when I was playing through the game, Alan walked into the room and he was like, you know what

204
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:41,720
this is, he says this this is this is Nomura, this is a representation of the fans in the game.

205
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,400
He said this is Nomura's fans telling him he can't do this.

206
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,720
By golly, he kind of nailed it.

207
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,400
Like he called what it was like early on.

208
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,360
So I just I that's why I actually thought Final Fantasy seven remake actually was really, really

209
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,760
good, is that it is not a shot for shot remake of Final Fantasy seven.

210
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,000
And when you kind of get to that point, you start to sort of realize, oh, the whole like we're

211
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,480
remaking a legendary game and having to live up to the pressures of that is a plot point.

212
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,600
I actually think it's brilliant.

213
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:22,760
So anyway, so it's remake, rebirth, and then I'm sure the third part will be re coded, re reborn,

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,120
re resurrected.

215
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,880
I don't know.

216
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
So but I'm sure.

217
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,240
Oh, you know what?

218
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,680
That's that's it.

219
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,360
I think that's where it ends up going.

220
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,960
Aerith dies, but then they realize that they can change these sorts of fates and Final Fantasy seven

221
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,760
resurrected is bringing her back.

222
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,760
That's my bet.

223
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,040
So we'll see.

224
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:53,120
But I am excited to give Crisis Core and all that stuff, I play because I didn't really play through

225
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,400
it and when it was originally on PSP or any of that anyway.

226
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:03,840
So Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the end of remake talks a lot about destiny and how certain

227
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,880
characters know what destiny is and how we're going against destiny.

228
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,640
Yes.

229
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,160
And that was it was a little more subtle in the original Final Fantasy seven, but it really beat

230
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,720
you over the head with it in the remake, and that is the fact that Aerith knew she was going to die

231
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,400
and Sephiroth knew he was going to kill her.

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,640
And that in the original Final Fantasy seven, it's more subtle.

233
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,720
It's something you don't really figure it out until the end.

234
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,840
But in the remake, you are it's very explicit that this is something that they know through the

235
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,160
game.

236
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,600
So anyway, I know a lot of you might be going, oh, Rob, it's been two years.

237
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,360
I haven't played the game.

238
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,920
Why did you have to?

239
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:49,320
Because I'm at a point where I can't let this social media discussion continue from uninformed

240
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,480
individuals who continue to still think this is a literal remake of the game.

241
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,560
And if you haven't got if you've gone the two years and reimaging, yeah, if you've gone the two

242
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,360
years and not played it, then you've told me it's not that much of a high priority to you.

243
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,000
And I need to clear the air.

244
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,920
This once you play the remake, you will understand it is not a remake.

245
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,520
It's a it's a reimagining, a recoding, all those words.

246
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,400
So anyway, Tiger Claw in chat says we've seen stuff like this before, where a character we thought

247
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,080
died was brought back in a follow up and explained how this person somehow survived.

248
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,200
Oh, it happens in movies and stuff all the time, right?

249
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,040
Or or they magically come back through a videotape like Randy and the Scream movies or something

250
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,440
like that. Or, you know, now or they're talking about trying to get Matthew Lillard back in the

251
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,840
Scream franchise. It's like he very clearly died in the first movie.

252
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,800
Well, no one's really dead in a horror movie now, are they?

253
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,080
Right. So, yeah.

254
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,280
Oh, Bobby Black Wolf also points out Star Trek 2009.

255
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,640
That's an excellent comparison to what's happening in the Final Fantasy 7 universe.

256
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,520
That is an excellent, excellent comparison.

257
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,920
Does the Star Trek reimagined?

258
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,800
Hmm. Although it is technically an alternate universe.

259
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,040
That is true. Yeah, yeah.

260
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,440
Well, yeah, it's very explicitly an alternate universe where Final Fantasy 7 isn't as explicit with that.

261
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,040
But yeah, the Kelvin universe or whatever you want to call it.

262
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,920
But then then the gag is and why not?

263
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,120
Why don't I spoil a Star Trek movie, too?

264
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,560
Then when Star Trek, the second one came out, what was the one with Benedict Cumberbatch?

265
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,920
What was the subtitle of that?

266
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,880
Star Trek Beyond? No, that was third one was Beyond.

267
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,400
Star Trek Insurrection was the next one, Into Darkness.

268
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
OK. Into Darkness.

269
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
So plot twist for Into Darkness.

270
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Into Darkness is just the Wrath of Khan.

271
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,320
But they don't tell you that until the end, but they do.

272
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:50,600
But then that one kind of beats you over the head with it because they're kind of like these very clear plot points that happen in Star Trek, the Wrath of Khan.

273
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:57,200
They were like, OK, OK, but what if, what if Kirk and Spock had their roles reversed?

274
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,120
And that's why I thought that movie was kind of lame, is that they should adjust from the start, said they were doing a Wrath of Khan remake.

275
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,440
That's I don't know. Anyway, all right.

276
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,520
I'm getting off track, but I just yeah, I think this Final Fantasy 7 stuff is I'm a spoiler madman.

277
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,320
OK, but literally, how old is that Star Trek movie?

278
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,440
It's over 10 years old.

279
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,120
For an age, the statute of limitations as long as it's passed.

280
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,600
It is.

281
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,560
I really think when it comes to video games, like six months is about the statute of limitations.

282
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,000
And it's been like two years.

283
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,320
So just just wanted to say so.

284
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,160
All right. Yeah. Bobby says we wanted to do a spoiler cast on Final Fantasy 7 remake after we both finished it.

285
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,080
And yeah, it just we never really able to coordinate.

286
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,160
And a lot of that is on me.

287
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,840
So but yeah, Bobby says Rob and I geeked out over the ending.

288
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,600
True, we did.

289
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,920
And like because Bobby and I both played it and then we were like talking to each other on phones.

290
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
It's like I can't talk about this on OLR because I don't want to ruin it for people.

291
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,080
But this is so brilliant.

292
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,960
This is so like this is not what I expected to happen.

293
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,640
It's so good.

294
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,200
So but I am intentionally so that you do have a reason to play it.

295
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,880
Those of you that haven't done it over the last two years.

296
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,840
I'm not telling you what all the changes are that they made because it is interesting.

297
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,440
So experience that part for yourselves.

298
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,920
But yes, I'm I'm glad they're not calling it Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 2.

299
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,520
And in my opinion, anyone that's telling you it should be Remake Part 2 did not play the first game.

300
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,160
All right.

301
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,400
All right.

302
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,120
Thank you, chat.

303
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,360
Now they're spoiling everything.

304
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,840
All right.

305
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,520
Thank you.

306
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,520
Gamer Xtafur in chat says, Can I spoil Returnal for everyone then?

307
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,400
I love that game and don't mind ruining a few people's dreams.

308
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,720
I would prefer you didn't because I still don't have a PS5, but I guess you are past the statute of limitations.

309
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,920
Why don't you do this?

310
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,360
Xtafur, if you have to spoil someone, text me, but don't ruin the chat.

311
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,680
And by the way, it's good to see you.

312
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
I haven't played it, but you can ruin it for me.

313
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:59,640
I'll be OK because I also know I see like spoilers for Drag Race and Survivor and stuff, and I still watch it because usually the journey is how to get there.

314
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,320
So if it's a good story.

315
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
Isn't that the definition of a journey?

316
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,480
Yes, exactly.

317
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,200
Or yeah, and E3VL talks about Darth Vader is Luke's father.

318
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,000
Anyone our age knows that and probably knew that before.

319
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:23,400
Well, maybe not quite our age because some of us did get to see it in the theater as kids, but most people around our age probably knew that the first time they saw Empire Strikes Back.

320
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,200
I know I did.

321
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,160
Did that ruin the movie?

322
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,200
I saw that in the theater.

323
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,480
No.

324
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,280
Yeah.

325
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,200
I was young, but I saw it in the theater.

326
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,800
Actually, I saw Star Wars when I was nine months old, so.

327
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,400
And it was quite a revelation at the time, right?

328
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:36,920
Oh, yeah.

329
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,400
Oh, yeah.

330
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,760
It was huge.

331
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,720
Well, I mean, not that I know anything about it since I was nine months old.

332
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:54,880
I was I mean, it's probably the reason why Return of the Jedi is my favorite, because I was actually old enough to have more of a formative memory of seeing it.

333
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,200
Or take the movie Titanic.

334
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,560
Yes, the boat sinks because it's based on that historical event.

335
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,640
But even if you took the fiction part, she's an old lady at the beginning.

336
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,120
You know, she lives through the event.

337
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,840
You don't see Jack anywhere as an old man.

338
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,920
You can guess what happens to Jack.

339
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,640
Jack knocked her up and ran off the bum.

340
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,720
All right.

341
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,440
Yeah, in the real version, he sat on the thing with her and they didn't get hypothermia.

342
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,080
And then he was like, oh, you know what?

343
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,920
I don't like you anymore.

344
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,160
Bye.

345
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,000
That's that's the passion of the Christ.

346
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,560
I did not.

347
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:38,200
Well, talk about fiction.

348
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
That's that's the oh, my God.

349
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,600
That's the like multiverse movie I want to see.

350
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,360
Not Passion of the Christ, but Titanic.

351
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,200
I don't need to see torture porn.

352
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,560
That's all the passion of the Christ was.

353
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:56,560
But I would I would love to see Titanic, but like the multiverse version that like plays out completely differently.

354
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,440
I would love that.

355
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,800
They address that in Supernatural.

356
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,840
Oh, do they?

357
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:11,800
And and yeah, in this one episode of Supernatural and all because of the Titanic, the the Sam and Dean did not have an Impala.

358
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,320
They had a Mustang, which is actually supposed to be the original car they were supposed to drive.

359
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,560
Celine Dion did not become famous for the song.

360
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,200
In fact, no one knew who she was.

361
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,680
She was a lounge singer in Canada.

362
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:29,440
And they were like they they had like all these extra people existing in the universe.

363
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,760
That was sort of the reason why they saved the Titanic was to get extra people born.

364
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,720
But it was it was pretty funny, like some of the differences that episode was really, really good.

365
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,120
It was also it's funny getting to see, you know, one of the fates to out some angels.

366
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,400
Some folks in chat talking about what the multiverse of Titanic might look like.

367
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,160
Tiger Claw saying a multiverse of Titanic in which a universe the Titanic never sank.

368
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,640
You have to be careful walking that line because it was based on a historical event.

369
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,680
People really did die.

370
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,560
We don't want to be disrespectful, but we can poke all the fun we want at the fictional elements of that.

371
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:15,600
However, I also know that there has been plenty of interesting science fiction type of stories told about major historical events going a different way.

372
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,280
Like that is a major plot point in a lot of things.

373
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,240
So it doesn't have to be disrespectful.

374
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,280
It's just kind of it's just a careful line to walk.

375
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,080
That's all I'm saying.

376
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:40,640
But the other thing, too, like thinking, though, just like realistically, you know, if the Titanic hadn't sank or the Olympic or the other ones also like that, that we probably wouldn't have the same safety laws on major sea vessels that we do now.

377
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
You're absolutely right.

378
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,440
You're absolutely right.

379
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,200
Let's see other comments.

380
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:53,960
Quest Buster now talks about the total like camp version of that alt history stuff, saying in raise the Titanic, they raise the Titanic to build an anti missile shield.

381
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,680
Not joking.

382
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,320
Yeah, let's see.

383
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,040
Gamer extra for says, anyway, my takeaway from this is that Rose is a murderer in the Alpha Titanic verse.

384
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,960
Yeah, yeah.

385
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,840
So one other interesting thing, one of my favorite channels is Ask a Mortician.

386
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,120
Oh, and oh, yeah.

387
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,400
Her channel is fantastic.

388
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,960
And also that British drag queen who does all the impersonations did her to it was beautiful.

389
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:31,240
But she she did one about what happened to the bodies and pretty much the bodies have disintegrated.

390
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,000
Oh, wow.

391
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,320
Because of the underwater pressure.

392
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

393
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,560
And makes sense.

394
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,960
But that's why they would find pairs of shoes.

395
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,960
Just by themselves, pair of shoes.

396
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,520
Bobby Blackwell says Jamie's learning where to hide your body.

397
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,040
Be nice.

398
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,880
Well, you know, it's I already know a lot of ways to hide a body.

399
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,080
I hope this topic isn't too weird for people, but I want to assure everyone I'm very comfortable talking about this.

400
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,760
I have a friend that I met through Rocky Horror who happens to be a mortician.

401
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:15,640
And when my mom passed away, I found that it was actually a really like it was a really good friend to have because he was able to walk me through all these things that are very difficult about the cremation and all that stuff.

402
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,880
And I knew I wasn't going to be taken advantage of, like with up sales or anything like that.

403
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,440
Like he really was just able to very plainly and effectively tell me and walk me through these steps.

404
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,800
And like, there was like such a comfort in that that I can't like articulate very well.

405
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,000
But like, I really he sometimes comes into Twitch and watches some of these things.

406
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,640
I don't know if he watches OLR, but if he happens to be out there, I just want to say I know we don't talk every day, but I really appreciated that in that moment and having that comfort and so forth.

407
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,480
So sometimes it's good to know a mortician and keep some of those tips around because it's one of those things you don't want to use.

408
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,800
But when you need it, it's nice.

409
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,760
Sometimes it's also good to just be Jewish.

410
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,800
Well, faith and religion certainly play a lot.

411
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,880
No, there's a reason.

412
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,840
Oh, 24 hour burial in a pine box.

413
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,520
Yeah, very clear, very clear, very color guidelines.

415
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:10,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

416
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,240
Yep, I'm down for that.

417
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,040
Although honestly, I'm going to do the tree pod thing and be planted on federal land.

418
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,400
Seriously, if bodies are buried on federal land, it can't be reclaimed for development.

419
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,360
Gamer Extifer, on the final note on Titanic here, and then I swear we're moving on.

420
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:39,080
Gamer Extifer says, fun fact, it's common for shoes to wash up on shore with human feet in them because they're the first things to break apart from bodies that get thrown or drown in the ocean.

421
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,800
For instance, probably Jack's foot because Rose murdered him.

422
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
That's a fun fact.

423
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,680
Did you notice that his finger breaks off when she lets go of his hand?

424
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,440
No.

425
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,840
I recognized it the first time I saw the movie that like, it was like his thumb or his finger broke off when she let him go into the water.

426
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,920
Are we sure it wasn't a piece of ice that just wasn't clear in 1997 HD?

427
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,640
Wow.

428
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,720
It was a finger.

429
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:13,160
It was basically this wax model that we have made of him has a faulty finger, either that or a hyper, hyperthermia.

430
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,760
Yeah.

431
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,600
Hyperthermia.

432
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,920
All right, yeah, Dr. Seuss just needs more energy.

433
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:25,840
I love morbid topics like this for the record, and we need to have like another community redeem that's called like, Orange Lounge Morbidio.

434
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,880
We still have to make good on the foodie-o redeem, and I keep meaning to schedule that.

435
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,240
And then it's like, oh, I'm going to get a new computer and throw everything into, you know, but let's get through the foodie-o.

436
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:43,840
We could do the Memento Mori edition of the Orange Lounge Radio where we just talk about all things death because we know what Memento Mori means.

437
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,720
I'm sorry, DJ Ramah.

438
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,840
A reminder of death.

439
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,400
DJ Ramah S in chat says, it's morbid time.

440
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,400
I'll see if my friend will come on the show that week.

441
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:54,680
That'd be cool.

442
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,240
That might be fun.

443
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,640
All right.

444
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:05,040
Anyway, it would actually be cool to have your friend on when I, when I get my Dead by Daylight thing going, the in-character, the in-character conversation.

445
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,800
You actually probably know him, but I'll text you to see I'm not talking about people who aren't here.

446
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,800
So, okay.

447
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:18,880
But anyway, I like, uh, the, the science of death, but I hate the economy of it.

448
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,080
Yes.

449
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,560
Yes.

450
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,480
All right, let's move on.

451
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,640
Uh, oh, Bobby says two things.

452
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,360
Rob needs to check J text Jamie about now.

453
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,520
Text her one.

454
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,120
See, we multitask here on this show and there's three of us do.

455
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,960
And I mean, I'm on a Mac.

456
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,560
I can just open my messages.

457
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,840
I don't have to look at my phone.

458
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,040
Y'all have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.

459
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,600
I could be reading fan fiction.

460
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,680
I could be plotting, you know, the overthrow of the country because I could run it better.

461
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,320
Um, I mean, I'm not going to do any of those things.

462
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,160
That's hypothetical.

463
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,640
I could do the work zoom call.

464
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:52,920
Oops.

465
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,720
I could do the work zoom call thing and have my phone here.

466
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,280
Oh, just barely off the camera.

467
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,400
I could do that, but.

468
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,240
And hey, I work in my pajamas and I draw art while I work.

469
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,040
I'm not wearing pants right now.

470
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,440
I'm not either.

471
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,000
No, I'm just kidding.

472
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,880
I have jeans on.

473
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,640
I have jeans on everybody.

474
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,640
I went out walking.

475
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,120
Okay.

476
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,080
All right.

477
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,360
I'm, I'm wearing shorts.

478
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,080
All right.

479
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,720
It's fine.

480
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,400
Pajama shorts.

481
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,200
Dress comfortably.

482
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,000
All right, let's move on.

483
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,120
We got to get, move on with the show and let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

484
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,840
Dark soccer.

485
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,440
I'm going to start with you.

486
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,200
How was your gaming week?

487
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,520
Um, it was eventful.

488
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,400
Hold on.

489
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,600
I'm, I'm telling dark Tetsuya that it's our show and we'll talk about what we want.

490
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,320
There you go.

491
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,000
So anyway,

492
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,920
I love how you had to say it on air and in chat as if there's a chance start to see it doesn't have his audio on right now.

493
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:56,840
No, I, I, I have to reiterate because I'm feeling, I'm feeling a little bit sassy and we can talk about anything we want to.

494
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,080
We can talk about corpses.

495
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,200
We can talk about hemorrhoids.

496
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
We can talk about colonoscopies.

497
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,960
We can talk about like, the hemophilia.

498
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,240
We can talk about anything medical or real life that we want to.

499
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,040
Okay.

500
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,360
Okay.

501
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,480
Loki, this is also the first time that I think I've mentioned a colonoscopy on the show.

502
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,680
So, Hey, there you go.

503
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,920
Loki, what do you want to talk about?

504
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,720
Do you want to talk about your colon or you want to talk about something else?

505
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,520
Wait, Loki talked about a colonoscopy before, right?

506
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,360
No, no, someone did.

507
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,960
No, that was like, you're thinking the kidney stone issues.

508
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,200
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:29,920
Okay.

510
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,040
That goes up the other side.

511
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,720
Yeah.

512
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,520
Well, okay.

513
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,280
So I have, I have gaming stuff.

514
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,720
And a little bit of expansion on some gaming stuff.

515
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,000
We do sell this as a video game podcast.

516
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,920
So it would be nice.

517
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,400
What the fuck is going on this week, right?

518
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:56,320
I also want to point out if our 20th anniversary should get any media traction, which I doubt it will, but if it does, this is the show people are going to hear leading up to the 20th anniversary.

519
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,280
So make it count kids.

520
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,440
You know what?

521
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,240
Reasons.

522
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,120
Anyway.

523
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:14,080
So at any rate, um, I have, I actually, I played Terra Nigma on Wednesday and I got it to the point where I'm just about to beat the game.

524
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:14,720
Nice.

525
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:21,160
So I have stopped and I've put up a poll for what my next game is going to be.

526
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,000
And so I believe that final fantasy six went out.

527
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:32,800
Uh, between final fantasy four and final fantasy six, I would, I'm actually looking for a direct translation.

528
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,560
I would like my, I voted sticker because I voted for final fantasy four in that poll.

529
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,760
Um, at any rate though, I mean, it's either of them are fantastic games.

530
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,600
I love to be playing either.

531
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,000
Um, but I'm actually thinking the one after that to be star ocean.

532
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,440
We had a lot of people interested in me playing star ocean.

533
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:06,000
So, um, but going, uh, back, I've decided that since it is the sixth anniversary for dead by daylight and it's only a two week thing, or as I said, a 13 day thing.

534
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:19,200
Um, I'm basically all of my streams are going to be dead by daylight until it's over, uh, just so that I can make sure I've maximized, uh, my, my blood points and gotten all the goodies.

535
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:29,760
And I had a really fun game, uh, last night on stream where, uh, I was playing pig because I'm a pig main and I don't care what anybody says she's S tier God level.

536
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:40,280
Um, and I decided, and I, there's like one of those, uh, like rift quests to do where you have to find one of the invitation pillars.

537
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,320
So basically in the game, you find these pillars that move around at random that have an invitation on them.

538
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:54,840
And when you interact with it, it unlocks a masquerade mask for 12 different characters in the game, you know, all unique to those characters.

539
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,280
And I had to do one of those and they were really hard to find.

540
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,080
Like I only had six at that point.

541
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,280
So I, uh, I went on pig, so, you know, relatively speedy character.

542
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:15,720
I went on, um, and I actually had dead dog, which is I think the smallest map, like the smallest single level map.

543
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,000
And basically I just ran around ignoring the survivors.

544
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,560
I mean, like I hit a couple of people just, you know, because one of them was a Steven, a Steve and you always hit a Steve.

545
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,240
Um, and then I just started wondering around looking for the, uh, the thing.

546
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,720
And so they're like, Oh, it's a pig player, boop, boop.

547
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,160
And I'm like, okay, get your boops.

548
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,600
And then I would turn around and go back to looking for, for the pillar until they realized I was looking for the pillar.

549
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,280
So they're like walking along with me, helping me look for the pillar.

550
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,680
And someone came and got me and said, there it is.

551
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:53,240
You know, and I was like, cause you know, they can point and I looked over, there's like, Oh my gosh, I almost walked right past it.

552
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,960
And cause since it moves, you have to be really quick on it.

553
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:02,440
And I was just like, but it's something that I love about Dead by Daylight, the people that play it.

554
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:11,360
I mean, yeah, you can get like really bully terrible people, you know, that are playing against you and people who don't want to meme with you or any of that.

555
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:18,040
And then you find the people who seem to understand what you're trying to do and help you do it.

556
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,440
The nonverbal cue stuff is huge.

557
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:26,840
And you know, it ties into your classic game of the week, last week or the week before was, was Journey from the PlayStation 3.

558
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,040
And that was a huge part of that game.

559
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:36,600
I would say Dead by Daylight actually kind of takes its cues from Journey in that regard, where you had like those, that like chirp button is the only way you could communicate with players.

560
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,000
But in Dead by Daylight, it's either point or come here.

561
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,480
And that's like all the only like two things you can do.

562
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,000
So it's really, well, but dance or yeah, you can kind of nods, spins like there are some other things you can do.

563
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,120
But for the most part, you're limited to those nonverbal cues and killers have less people get really creative with that.

564
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,680
Yeah, like the things that I've learned is that if you're going to help somebody out, you give them the notters.

565
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,920
If you don't want to meme around, you shake your head, right?

566
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,080
If if you want someone to do an action, you attack the item.

567
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:18,840
Like if I want someone to drop a pallet on me because I had that one where you have to be in chase and have a pallet dropped on you and you break the pallet and then go after them.

568
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,080
So I would go back and just hit the pallet and say, hey, hit this.

569
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:31,560
Or if I wanted to let somebody go, I would, you know, or wanted someone to do gens or farm or something, I would hit the generator just with my normal weapon and then kick it.

570
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,440
And then, you know, go back and forth, you know, different things like that.

571
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,880
Or if, you know, I wanted to like last night I had a doctor game and I was giving somebody and I was actually playing pretty, pretty mean.

572
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,840
But I decided that I wanted this one Jill to live and I don't know, just I had this feeling that I wanted this Jill to live.

573
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,560
And then I wanted to, you know, hook the bill because fuck Bill.

574
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,840
You know how I feel about a bill.

575
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,840
I do.

576
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,760
Oh, Billiam, oh, Bill, he dies.

577
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,960
Anyway, so at any rate, so the I don't think the Jill quite believed me.

578
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:15,480
So I was like, I was doing the electric attack at the at the at the hatch because you can hear when that goes off.

579
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,760
And I was like, it's right here, it's right here.

580
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,560
And finally, I just went after her and gave her like the super notters and then headed in the direction of the thing.

581
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,600
And she's like, oh, I get it.

582
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
You're being nice.

583
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,280
And she went down the hatch.

584
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,080
So I love that.

585
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,280
But then you get assholes.

586
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,040
Yeah, I know.

587
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:41,400
And the assholes have been out in force, like to the point where I'm just keeping a because, you know, now those new what is it?

588
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,200
The the build saver things are up.

589
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:54,480
And I have a I have a few that's permanently have light born on it so that no one can flashlight me and then I can laugh at them when I realize that they're doing the oh shit moment.

590
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
I love that moment.

591
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,880
And then, you know, go on about my game and it's been pretty fun.

592
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:14,560
And, you know, I'm not the only one that's noticed that on both sides because, you know, a lot of my survivor main friends are like, oh, these these killers are being like extra sweaty and all of this.

593
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,960
And I'm like, well, I mean, it is good for blood points.

594
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,120
You know, if everyone brings like the flan, we no longer have cake this year, we have flan.

595
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,880
Flantastic.

596
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,320
It's flantastic.

597
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,080
Yes, a flaniversary.

598
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:37,960
But at any rate, it's it's been a really weird mix and people are also playing weird.

599
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Have you noticed that?

600
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
A little bit.

601
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,360
They're not farming like they did during the last event.

602
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:43,800
It's weird.

603
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,680
Anyway, not everyone plays dead by daylight.

604
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:52,680
So but can I say one quick thing, though, because this about all games in general, not just dead by daylight, but you talked about it.

605
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,440
You talked about the tier list and how you play pig, even though she's not considered S tier.

606
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,480
And I think you already know what you're saying to you.

607
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,200
She's S tier.

608
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,520
But that's the point.

609
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,760
That's actually the point is that tier list for any game, Smash Brothers, whatever it is that you're into.

610
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,080
Tier lists are bullshit.

611
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,560
I'm here to say tier lists are bullshit and they're clickbait and they're there to start an argument.

612
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,200
That's all it is.

613
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,800
And I don't even care if it's based off statistics.

614
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,360
That's right.

615
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,600
I'm telling you, I don't care about math.

616
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,520
I don't care about facts because video games are supposed to be fun.

617
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,480
So the tier list, what?

618
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,840
The tier list can be super fun, especially if you make one on stream and you make it like completely ridiculous.

619
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,160
If you know that it's ridiculous and not serious.

620
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,960
And so when I say like, you know, oh, there's a definitive, you know, some dead by daylight streamer put out the definitive tier list of killers or whatever.

621
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,360
Otz Darva puts out those lists.

622
00:38:50,360 --> 00:39:00,680
And then when I started playing, I looked at the tier list that existed at that point that Otz made.

623
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,120
Yeah.

624
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:08,640
And I was like, okay, I kind of get, you know, reading over, you know, get these perks for these killers, play them in this order.

625
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,560
It's a good idea.

626
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,720
And then I realized after, you know, I started with plague.

627
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,640
I mean, you remember I started with as a plague main.

628
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:23,800
And then I was like, fuck this, Legion's more fun, even though Legion is considered, you know, at the time, not very great.

629
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah, it's all about what makes the game fun for you.

630
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,400
And for me, I think she's like mid tier on the technical ones or whatever, but I love playing Sadako as the killer.

631
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,240
Like she's a lot of fun to me.

632
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,200
I love, I really love dredge though, porting around the map.

633
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,040
See, and I can't get into dredge the same way I get into Sadako, even though they both have the teleportation mechanic.

634
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,880
But Sadako has these add ons that make it really fun.

635
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,520
And like, I just really like playing her.

636
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,800
So I thought it was fun.

637
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,400
Don't get me wrong.

638
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,240
I love Sadako.

639
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,560
On top of that, she's really short and shorter killers are easier for me to not get motion sick with.

640
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,040
Yeah, and it's but that's again, it's taste.

641
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,400
So taste greater than tier list.

642
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,440
Anyway, I also do like freaking people out with dredge because if you get it just the right moment, you'll scare the shit out of somebody.

643
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,840
You can get some good jump scares on him.

644
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,340
Yeah.

645
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:19,320
Oh, especially I use this add on where every time he goes through a locker, he exits a locker, all the lockers bang their doors.

646
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,720
Oh, that's awful.

647
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
It's one of his eries.

648
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,720
Oh, wow.

649
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,360
All right.

650
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah.

651
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,880
Okay, so back to my other games.

652
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,440
Yes.

653
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,680
So yeah, it was Terranigma, it was Dead by Daylight, it was wordscapes.

654
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:38,920
But another one I'm going to count because I think that my decisions have helped other people play it or my suggestions is the quarry.

655
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,760
So many fucking people are playing the quarry that I feel like I have played it too.

656
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,120
Because like, I've gotten into it and like,

657
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,120
it's kind of meant to be played like that, though.

658
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,800
Like it's, it's a couch co-op game that works really well on Twitch, in a way.

659
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,200
Except for, of course, all the QuickTime events, because the person playing it really does need to be on their game.

660
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,720
Yeah.

661
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,160
Like, especially the ones where you have to shoot things.

662
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:16,000
Oh, but anyway, the the fun thing for me, I mean, and some of the some of the people that have stayed for like long playthroughs have have taken my suggestions.

663
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,560
They liked my logic behind it.

664
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,920
And so we've had a really, really good time.

665
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:28,600
And I've, I've really kind of gotten into the lore of it now.

666
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:35,040
I'm at the problem right now where I think it will run a Windows 11 ARM because it's an x64 game.

667
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:48,720
But I'm afraid that the the cheat anti cheat on it won't run like I'm having that same problem with VHS and Dead by Daylight through Steam.

668
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:59,400
So I'm, that's why I haven't bought it, but I've watched like playthroughs and everything and the cast in this game is absolutely amazing.

669
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,560
Like, I'm just gonna say Ted Raimi's in it and leave it at that.

670
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,080
Mic drop.

671
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,080
Grace Zebrowski, Laura Palmer's mom is in it.

672
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:14,480
And like I told Shane, I'm like, if you led with that, I would have bought this game day one, because he's been trying to get me to play it.

673
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,640
Halston Sage is in it.

674
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,040
She she had her the the Dazzler cameo in X-Men Dark Phoenix.

675
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,200
The kid from Detective Pikachu, isn't it?

676
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,360
Yeah, he played he plays Ryan, the one that people either hate or love.

677
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,080
Yeah, yeah.

678
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,000
But also Lin Shaye is in it.

679
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,840
She was the the elderly woman in the grudge at the beginning of the movie.

680
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,920
And she was the psychic in the insidious movies.

681
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,120
David Arquette.

682
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,320
Mm hmm.

683
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:52,520
Yeah, and like Bobby said this, the other thing I didn't mention is that Halston Sage was also in Orville.

684
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,920
But I mean, we've got some like, really good.

685
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,520
Really, really good people in it.

686
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:12,200
And I'm actually going to try to confirm something real quick because Mark Silverman plays the near yep, Mark Silverman is the biggest person.

687
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,480
The biggest voice mimic for Rod Serling.

688
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:30,280
And when I was listening to the tutorial parts of it, I was like, holy shit, that totally sounds like like, like, you know, Rod Serling.

689
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:36,040
And I was like, I bet it's that guy who does his voice in all of the things like for Tower of Terror.

690
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,520
So it was him.

691
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,480
It was absolutely him.

692
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,160
How funny.

693
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,520
And I absolutely love that.

694
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,920
They've got like and Brenda Song.

695
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,040
Oh, yeah.

696
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,520
Hello.

697
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,040
Yeah.

698
00:43:47,480 --> 00:44:01,080
But like, it's funny, though, how many of these people were in, like, were Disney actors, and then went on to be like in various scary movies.

699
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:11,560
Like we had the guy that played Dylan was in Halloween in the twenty eighteen Halloween, the guy who played Nick as in Star Trek, Picard, we have a lot of oh, and Lance Henriksen is in it.

700
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,560
I mean, oh, wow.

701
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,200
Can you can you get much cooler?

702
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,440
But that's I mean, it just goes to show like how well Until Dawn did that the studio now has.

703
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:26,920
I mean, you know, Until Dawn had what's her name from Heroes, who plays Kirby and scream Hayden Penta near.

704
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,320
I don't know if I'm right, but that was like the biggest name that was in that Until Dawn.

705
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,520
And now they're getting a lot.

706
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:44,680
I mean, just because either the budget got bigger or the game, you know, because y'all might remember or not, Until Dawn exceeded expectations big time because they really did not market that game.

707
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:53,280
And I don't know if it's because of streaming or what the strong word of mouth, but that game did very, very well where it was all of a sudden like, whoa, there needs to be a franchise here.

708
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,840
And so there was the Medal of Adan.

709
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:00,360
But this is like the first true like follow up that is very, very similar to Until Dawn.

710
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:08,400
The one thing is that all these articles that have Ted Raimi listed, they mention Evil Dead, they mention Spider-Man, but they forget his most important role.

711
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,400
Jock, sir.

712
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
Hello.

713
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
Oh, right.

714
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Right.

715
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:22,400
So at any rate, though, there's another little bit of interesting trivia about this, and that is that the game is a little bit different from the original game, but it's a little bit different from the original game.

716
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:46,520
And I would say that the game was, well, I don't know if it's a rumor or if it was based on different, the fact that Google had a partnership with Supermassive, the publisher, or sorry, the developer, but apparently the quarry was supposed to be on Stadia.

717
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:52,640
Because of those developments that happen with the in-house production for different things that fell through the cracks.

718
00:45:52,640 --> 00:46:00,640
There's also supposed to be the game High on Life was supposed to, they were, both of them were associated.

719
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:08,640
They were associated by partnership, but never officially associated with Stadia.

720
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:20,760
Supermassive was looking for a publishing partner when the project came to completion, but it ended up, it didn't get released on it.

721
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:28,760
Now, if it had been released on Stadia, I would have paid full fucking price for this and any DLC or whatever would have happened.

722
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,760
This would have been mine.

723
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:37,880
They've reached out for comment on it, but, you know, no one's really said anything.

724
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:44,880
And I mean, it's not like Stadia hasn't had some really big games. I mean, they got Resident Evil Village, you know.

725
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,880
Right.

726
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,880
They have Elder Scrolls Online, they got Mortal Kombat 11.

727
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,880
I'm still getting some pretty big titles on there. It's far from dead.

728
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So I can be hopeful.

729
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Although, I'm going to go ahead and just say this now since I mentioned Capcom.

730
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
A Resident Evil Village is coming to Mack and fall.

731
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Oh, cool.

732
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Yep.

733
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Apparently the new Metal and the M2 chip when it comes out is more than capable of actually playing games better than a lot of modern graphics cards.

734
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,120
And a lot of modern PCs.

735
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,120
So I might have to upgrade.

736
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,120
All right.

737
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,120
Well, that's it for your gaming week.

738
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,120
Let's go over to Loki and talk about your gaming week, Loki.

739
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:42,120
It's been very busy with Minecraft still, but I just started Channel 64 season two.

740
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:48,120
So we all kicked that off last night and last afternoon, I guess.

741
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,120
But it's been all day.

742
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,240
So very excited to get started making content on there.

743
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,240
And then this week's going to be busy with making content as well.

744
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,240
I took the week off from work to focus on content stuff.

745
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,240
So I'm going to see what I can come up with.

746
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,240
I've already done a lot.

747
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,240
So I got to go through a ton of footage.

748
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,240
Early game is always very hard to make content around.

749
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,240
At least structured content because it's kind of all over the place and you don't know what's going to happen.

750
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,240
So it takes a long time to edit, unfortunately.

751
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,360
But I'm confident that I'll be able to put some stuff out.

752
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,360
And I got to do some more of my hardcore series as well.

753
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,360
So yeah, lots of stuff coming out.

754
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,360
All right.

755
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,360
Well, best of luck with those videos and all that.

756
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,360
So looking forward to seeing the Minecraft content you put out.

757
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,360
And I know things have been getting bigger for you over on YouTube a little bit.

758
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,360
So congrats.

759
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
Yeah, a little bit.

760
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,360
We're like 460 now, I think.

761
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,360
Nice.

762
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,360
Almost 500.

763
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,360
That's great.

764
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,360
Maybe you'll cross 500 in the next week or so, right around the time OLR hits 20.

765
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,480
That's awesome.

766
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,480
Maybe.

767
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,480
Maybe.

768
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,480
Cool.

769
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,480
All right.

770
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,480
Let's see.

771
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,480
Moving on.

772
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,480
My gaming week.

773
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,480
So honestly, most of my week was taken up with a computer transition and just trying

774
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,480
to make sure everything would work for tonight and trying to get everything back up and running.

775
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,480
I didn't move my drives over.

776
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,480
I still have the old computer pretty much put together and I can pull files from it

777
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,480
as needed.

778
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,480
But for the most part, I just decided to kind of use this as like a fresh start.

779
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,480
I didn't want to run the same Windows install or try to do that or anything.

780
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,480
So I was just like, you know what, let's just start fresh.

781
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,600
And I'll copy over the stuff I need and still have those drives, you know, available if

782
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,600
I ever need to pull media off of them like pictures or something like that.

783
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,600
So yeah, spending most of my time setting it up.

784
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,600
However, you know, of course, I had to bring up Final Fantasy 14 and see how that would

785
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,600
run.

786
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,600
And it's so smooth.

787
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,600
It's like I'm not really playing at a better resolution or anything because I was playing

788
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,600
in 4K before, but I definitely noticed the frame rate improvement.

789
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,440
And now I'm excited that when I stream, I can actually use the 4K and have it.

790
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,440
I can't stream it in 4K.

791
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,240
Well, if Twitch allowed me to, I probably do have the computer powerful enough to stream

792
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,240
in 4K and I don't have limited bandwidth.

793
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,240
So if I was Twitch partner, I probably could stream it at 4K.

794
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:10,320
However, I'm not, I can always do a YouTube maybe, but I'm not really in a hurry to do

795
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,320
that.

796
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,800
But what I can do is play the game in the full window as opposed to having to size it

797
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,280
down just so I can stream it and not have my computer stutter all over the place.

798
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,280
So that'd be really nice.

799
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,260
I'm looking forward to that for like streaming.

800
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,580
So I played a little bit of that this week with Final Fantasy 14, didn't really make

801
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,760
any meaningful progress.

802
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,320
My paladin is 85, woohoo.

803
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,980
And then I also played a little bit of Dead by Daylight, just a little, but I wanted to

804
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,600
see how that would look on the new computer.

805
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,200
And that one, I mean, Dead by Daylight is a six year old game.

806
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,720
We're literally in the six year anniversary event.

807
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,040
So it's not like you have this massive 4K mode or anything, but it's nice enough.

808
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,880
I definitely noticed again, it's the smoothness.

809
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,680
It's a nice enough, and it is, I think a tactical advantage too.

810
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,900
I can see things in the background so much better now.

811
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,700
And so I can be more aware of things like I can see killers from further away and stuff

812
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,420
or make them out better than I could before.

813
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,040
So that part is kind of nice in the few games that I played.

814
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,600
That's what it's like for me on Stadia.

815
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,720
Oh yeah, cause Stadia is already doing the high graphics level processing.

816
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,720
Yeah.

817
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,720
So that's, that's nice.

818
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,720
Yeah.

819
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,280
So, yeah, there were definitely like, obviously the new Ninja Turtles game is very much on

820
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,280
my radar.

821
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,280
Like I'm hearing a lot of positive feedback about that cause that's very much geared at

822
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,560
our generation that played that in the pizza parlor, the old Turtles beat them up game.

823
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,860
And I have, I see a lot of people going, I wish they do this for the Simpsons.

824
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,400
And I think that's a great idea.

825
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,160
And what else, am I correct?

826
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,840
I believe the studio that made that Shredder's Revenge, I could be wrong, but I thought I

827
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:49,820
heard it's the same studio that did the Dragon Trap remake a couple of years ago.

828
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:55,980
And that was an excellent retro remake that, I mean, like that was like really one of them

829
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,320
done really well.

830
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,320
Okay.

831
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,320
Darktosuya says it's them.

832
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,320
Yeah.

833
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,720
I can see why this one is getting such positive critiques and the fact that they nailed it

834
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,900
because like that dragons, dragon or Wonder Boy, you know what I mean?

835
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:16,000
That game was a very, very good re re-imagining or whatever you want to call it.

836
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,160
Something else came out recently too that I wanted to play as well, but I just, you

837
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,320
know, I'll have to do it in this next week, but I really, really am hoping I can stream

838
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,680
more now because I can stream based off my PC and don't have to rely on the Xbox for

839
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,520
everything that's not Final Fantasy.

840
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,400
So and the nice thing is the Turtles game, Tunic and all these other games I've been

841
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,840
playing, they're on PC as well, so I can just go hog on Game Pass and stream it from

842
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,840
the PCs.

843
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,840
That'd be nice.

844
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,280
So S2100Matt says I'm still running Windows 7 on one machine here.

845
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:52,880
Well, can I point out, Matt, what a long way we've come from the studio that we were in

846
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,960
pre-pandemic at my old house where you might recall right before the pandemic happened

847
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:03,000
and we took the show virtual, you might remember I was running a machine that still had Windows

848
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
XP.

849
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,280
I almost said Windows 95, but it was Windows XP.

850
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,720
We're still running on that machine.

851
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:15,080
So and now my how far we've come in that short amount of time, relatively, I've gone from

852
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,980
an XP machine to 10 to now 11.

853
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,920
Now I'm ahead of a lot of people.

854
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,400
So yeah, tonight's show is on 11 now.

855
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,720
So yeah, Tiger Class says it's the new computer running on 11.

856
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,720
Yes it is.

857
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,880
And the start menu changes are really taking me some getting used to, but otherwise it's

858
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,880
fine.

859
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,460
Most of it hasn't changed from 10, at least as far as the user experience goes.

860
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:43,600
And that's a good thing in my opinion, like the taskbar stuff enough is a weird enough

861
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,680
change is taking me some getting used to.

862
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,920
But Jamie, I know you're an Apple device user and you would appreciate the insight that

863
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,360
my husband made on this whole thing.

864
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,400
After the first time he used Windows 11 and he said, you know, every new version of Windows,

865
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,880
they're just making it more and more like Mac OS.

866
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,640
I figured you'd appreciate that comment.

867
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,640
All right.

868
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,400
Um, Dr. C says it's not like eight.

869
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,400
Is it?

870
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,400
Oh no, it's nothing like eight.

871
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
They eight.

872
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,000
The reason why eight flopped is that eight was tried.

873
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,220
They tried to bring the tablet experience to a desktop didn't work.

874
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,520
So no, it's, it's not like eight at all.

875
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,120
So but 11 is fine.

876
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,200
Tiger class says you can change it to look more like 10.

877
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,200
Oh shit.

878
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,200
Maybe I need to do that.

879
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:35,560
The look of 11, but it's, I can, it's either or so anyway, let's move on.

880
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,800
Let's talk about some more news and, uh, we'd actually don't have a lot of headlines tonight.

881
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,800
I have to be honest.

882
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,800
We're about half the usual headlines.

883
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,800
So it could end up being a shorter show, but we talked about morbid shit for an hour.

884
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,360
So I don't know.

885
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,040
What do you expect here to LR, but we'll get into our first story.

886
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,160
I should say though, sorry, Logie.

887
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:02,200
I should officially say 20 comma O L R next week, the 20th anniversary of orange launch

888
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,200
radio.

889
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,500
This show started June 23rd, 2002.

890
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,500
It scrolls along the bottom.

891
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,160
You've probably seen it.

892
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,000
So we're celebrating 20 years on the air next week.

893
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,840
I don't have confetti cannons.

894
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,420
There is a cute little announcement.

895
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:21,960
There is a fan project that's been worked on and I'm going to tell you more about that

896
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,960
next week.

897
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,320
Uh, that's one little, so an announcement of an announcement.

898
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,640
Yes, I just did that.

899
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,720
So there will be a little something cute to look forward to otherwise.

900
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,720
You know what?

901
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,640
I'm just hoping we hear from some people we haven't heard from in a long time.

902
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,880
That's always the fun about hitting a big anniversary show.

903
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,620
I would love to hear from some people we haven't heard from from a long time.

904
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,620
Don't forget.

905
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,620
We have an email bag.

906
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,620
Participate at orange launch radio.com.

907
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,620
Twitter.

908
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,720
You need to get some cake at O L R.

909
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,720
I would love some cake.

910
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,240
Are you going to bring me some cake?

911
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,880
You can come over and have cake.

912
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,880
All right.

913
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,120
Now we can get him to some news.

914
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,040
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

915
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,920
Got some great news.

916
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:07,120
Activision has investigated themselves and they found no evidence that they've ignored

917
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,400
harassment.

918
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,520
And you know what?

919
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,400
I think I can trust them.

920
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,520
Activision, the company that's totally trustworthy to investigate themselves.

921
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:21,240
Because if you were guilty, I mean, you would totally be honest about all the guilty things

922
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,240
that you did.

923
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,200
You wouldn't just like say, oh, we didn't do that.

924
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,360
Oh, I didn't see all that evidence over there.

925
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,640
So case closed.

926
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:36,760
I mean, I guess the gaming industry is great now.

927
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,760
Harassment's dead.

928
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,400
We've solved it.

929
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,400
Activision's done it.

930
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,080
Oh, no.

931
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:51,600
So we were so close this time.

932
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,560
Mike Defton Chat says, I trust ABK with that investigation as much as I trust Riot with

933
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,560
theirs.

934
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,560
Facts.

935
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:07,480
I mean, congratulations on your internal investigations showing nothing when your employees have told

936
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,880
you there is something.

937
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,800
What's the problem here?

938
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:21,040
You've put together this whole, you know, show theatrics to try to prove your own employees

939
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,040
wrong?

940
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,380
They're just proving how well they've ignored the problem.

941
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:33,160
So they've ignored it so well that they can't see the problem anymore.

942
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,920
I hope and I don't think it will.

943
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,120
I mean, here's reality.

944
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,000
Activision may have cleared itself of an internal investigation.

945
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,640
Let us not forget how this whole thing started.

946
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,900
State of California is doing its own investigation into what's going on.

947
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:56,600
So there's still an external investigation pending, and that's the one that means something.

948
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:02,360
And don't they think that publishing results like this is really poor form?

949
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,360
Yeah.

950
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,840
And I saw you just agree with this comment.

951
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,880
I was about to read too, which hello to a VO by Kurt.

952
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,880
Kurt, good to see you.

953
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:14,720
Who says in chat, even if their investigations are real and whatnot, the optics alone are

954
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,500
the worst PR.

955
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,500
So short-sighted.

956
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:25,880
Very that, very that is that why have this whole press release and trout out this, this

957
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,800
should have been an internal PowerPoint.

958
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,840
And that's it.

959
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:39,520
It should not be a talking point or a bragging point or a dismissing your employees concerns

960
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:46,080
point, which is what it's turning into.

961
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:53,920
I think that's that chat comment is spot on is that it's terrible optics, even if they

962
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,320
think they're doing nothing wrong.

963
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:03,280
So we'll see what the external investigation, because if the external investigation finds

964
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,520
stuff, which it already has for this to be in the news in the first place, the fact that

965
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,800
the internal investigation shows nothing is just going to show that the internal investigation

966
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,040
was full of garbage.

967
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,920
And now Activision gets to own that.

968
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:23,300
The only investigation that's going to matter is the external.

969
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,300
Exactly that.

970
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,800
So, all right.

971
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:32,000
Let's move on and talk about, we talked earlier in the show about some announcements that

972
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,800
came out of Square regarding Final Fantasy 7, but let's talk about the next story, which

973
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,640
has to do with Capcom stuff.

974
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:50,120
So Capcom did their own press event this week and sorry, I'm having problems on the technical

975
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,800
end for whatever reason, the bar doesn't want to advance.

976
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,800
Okay.

977
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,800
That's weird.

978
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:03,240
So talking about Capcom, they've had a little announcement of their own, of a few things,

979
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:07,680
including what Dark Sakura just addressed earlier is that Resident Evil is kind of expanding

980
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:14,300
and we have Resident Evil Village is coming to Stadia, but we also got some new versions,

981
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,300
if you will.

982
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,300
It's already on Stadia.

983
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,300
Oh, sorry.

984
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:24,820
It's already launched on Stadia, but Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 are getting a minor update.

985
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:30,380
They're not new, they're basically like free upgrades, if you will, to be next gen compatible

986
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:34,700
for PlayStation 5, Xbox series, and PC and so forth.

987
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:39,320
So that is a free next gen upgrade, then that came out.

988
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,500
There will be a gold edition expansion for Resident Evil Village.

989
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,140
So they are detailing some of that DLC.

990
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:49,020
It will also contain a third person mode.

991
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:53,560
So you can play the game like the old school Resident Evils, if that's more your style,

992
01:00:53,560 --> 01:01:00,320
I know Dark Sakura's talked before about how first person can be very, you know, sick

993
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,320
inducing.

994
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,320
So...

995
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:06,880
Do we get the shirtless mods for Leon and Chris and all them?

996
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,880
Always on the internet, but never officially from Capcom.

997
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:16,880
There will also be a story involving Rose and all this comes out just in time for Halloween

998
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,340
on October 28th of this year.

999
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,680
So that's pretty cool.

1000
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:27,700
They also, for whatever reason, they confirmed it after the fact, but they did confirm that

1001
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,480
Dragon's Dogma 2 is a thing that's going to be happening.

1002
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:37,320
Although in the actual press event, they were like, we're celebrating the video, but whatever

1003
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,480
they did confirm a Dragon's Dogma 2 is coming.

1004
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,560
That is a game that kind of has grown a lot of fans over the years.

1005
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,360
So folks will be very happy to hear that.

1006
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:52,800
And Monster Hunter Rise has its first, I think expansion, I think it's the first expansion,

1007
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:58,080
Sunbreak is coming and there will be a demo for that that's coming out on June 14th.

1008
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:02,740
So lots of things going on in Capcom's world for them to have their own little video, which

1009
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:08,120
is also interesting considering there was no E3 this year that Capcom kind of did this

1010
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,120
instead.

1011
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,080
Now, Capcom was the type of studio that would do their own press event in the past anyway,

1012
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,680
but it's just interesting how it kind of played out this way when all was said and

1013
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,560
done after all.

1014
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:26,960
So anyway, did anyone watch that and think anything about the Capcom announcements?

1015
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,980
I watched some of it, but like I was kind of skimming through like a lot of it.

1016
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,760
I didn't notice the Dragon's Dogma thing.

1017
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,720
I wasn't, I didn't play the original, but like I was just trying to see if they had

1018
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,720
new information.

1019
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,280
It's a lot of it seemed like it was kind of the same stuff, maybe a little bit more

1020
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:51,640
expanded of what they already had shown during like the Xbox conference thing or even not

1021
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:56,000
so much Xbox, but like during the Summer Games Fest stuff.

1022
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,080
So I was just, I don't know.

1023
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:02,120
Dark to see you in chat says I did like what I saw of Street Fighter 6.

1024
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,120
You know what?

1025
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,120
Me too.

1026
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,120
And I'm just getting that vibe.

1027
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,120
I'm just getting that vibe that Street Fighter is going to be like Star Trek or like the

1028
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,200
even numbered ones are the good ones.

1029
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,480
Not to slander Street Fighter 3 too hard, but let's be real, it wasn't 4 and it wasn't

1030
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,480
2.

1031
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,080
Street Fighter 3 3rd Impact was fantastic.

1032
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,080
Oh yeah.

1033
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:23,160
By the time they finally refined it, yeah, it was, it was a lot better, but I don't know.

1034
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,000
It still didn't land with me the way 4 and 2 do.

1035
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,860
And then Street Fighter 5, like honestly is like a non-factor to me.

1036
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:31,860
I just, I tried it.

1037
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:37,320
I played, they gave it away at one point, I was just kind of not into it, but I'm interested

1038
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,320
in it.

1039
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,080
I was pissed off the Street Fighter 4 soundtrack was taken down out of Apple Music.

1040
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,720
Oh, I didn't know that.

1041
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,720
That's weird.

1042
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:48,640
Because it had like some of my favorite versions of the songs.

1043
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:54,360
Well you'll just have to turn to piracy or importing or whatever from Japan, I suppose

1044
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,360
would be the answer.

1045
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,360
I should say.

1046
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,040
We'll see how much I care about it.

1047
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,040
Yeah.

1048
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,040
All right.

1049
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,400
Let's move on to some more news.

1050
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,680
Dark Sakura with some unfortunate news.

1051
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:08,520
Well, we have a big womp womp for Halo Infinite.

1052
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:18,000
343 Industries had to issue an apology and a change in Halo Infinite for one of their

1053
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,560
cosmetics that they released.

1054
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:26,340
Now today is Juneteenth, it's June 19th, which is the annual commemoration of the end of

1055
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:29,880
slavery in the United States.

1056
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:38,920
So for Halo Infinite, they released an emblem with, you know, for some reason, it's not

1057
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,280
showing it, but you know, nice colors and everything.

1058
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:49,440
But it was, the palette option was called Bonobo, which is a kind of ape.

1059
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:57,880
And whoever let that go, or whoever even named it that in the beginning, need to be fucking

1060
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:06,520
fired, saying, but after it was pointed out, they updated the name to be Freedom and the

1061
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,520
official statement.

1062
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:13,100
And this comes from Bonnie Ross, the founder and head.

1063
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:17,780
We were made aware of a palette option for our Juneteenth emblem that contained a term

1064
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,700
that was offensive and hurtful.

1065
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,840
The team immediately addressed this issue via an update.

1066
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:27,640
We are a studio and franchise that is committed to inclusivity where everyone is welcome and

1067
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,760
supported to be their true selves.

1068
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:35,620
On behalf of 343, I apologize for making a celebrated moment a hurtful moment.

1069
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:38,580
That actually, I like how that was phrased.

1070
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,660
I'm glad she took accountability.

1071
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:45,740
Like the situation sucks, but I think we all know, Bobby Kotick would have phrased this

1072
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,180
a lot differently.

1073
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:50,620
And I appreciate that she at least, she didn't try to pass the buck.

1074
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,240
She didn't try to place blame.

1075
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,440
She said, I'm sorry.

1076
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,620
And we don't have enough CEOs to say that in this industry.

1077
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:03,760
There's also a statement from their community manor, John Junisic, I think is how it's pronounced.

1078
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,360
We strive to create a diverse and inclusive gaming communities while the original name

1079
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,580
refers to an internal tool set.

1080
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:15,280
It was not intended to be applied to this context and we recognize the harm it may have

1081
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,280
caused.

1082
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,280
Yeah.

1083
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,740
I was gonna say, I thought I had heard somewhere that that name was a reference to an internal

1084
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:23,980
tool set, but still, I mean, I'm not, I'm not excusing what happened because you still

1085
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:30,900
have to wonder how did it go through all these steps to actually being released without

1086
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:36,060
anyone catching that is a yikes.

1087
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:42,860
It's not the first time though, that we've seen unfinished items be published or things

1088
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:46,160
get published early or the wrong versions of things get published.

1089
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:52,300
You know, it, it happens, I mean, in the digital age, it can now be quickly and easily corrected,

1090
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,980
but still, I, that's a pretty big one.

1091
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,980
That's a pretty big one.

1092
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,740
A yikes to say the least.

1093
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:01,740
Yeah.

1094
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:07,300
Um, but I, I guess if there's anything to be hopeful about, again, at least you can

1095
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:14,700
kind of look at, okay, when a shitty situation happens, how does a person react to that?

1096
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,900
Do they, do they delete their Twitter account, India Farah?

1097
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:25,080
Do they, do they do that or do they, um, take accountability and ownership and, you know,

1098
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,080
and that whole thing.

1099
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,440
And, and at least she did that.

1100
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:34,980
So I'm again, not acute situation, not good, but let's be hopeful that when she says it,

1101
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:39,760
it should never happen again, that there is a little bit of substance behind that.

1102
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,760
We hope.

1103
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,760
Yeah.

1104
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,820
So, all right, well, moving on Loki.

1105
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,460
All right.

1106
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:52,660
Something the internet and the people of, uh, the gamers won't be accountable for is

1107
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,700
this, but we'll, we'll talk about this.

1108
01:07:54,700 --> 01:08:00,060
Well, people are not happy with Diablo immortal, um, especially after seeing Diablo four and

1109
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:07,620
how great that looks, um, basically, you know, bombing it on Metacritic as what they do.

1110
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:13,660
And so now it is the lowest rated user score or has the lowest rated user score of all

1111
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:21,380
time because you know, of their horrible monetization practices with it, it's just

1112
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:22,380
very pay to win.

1113
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:29,460
So not surprised as what happens, but did you, did you hear the followup from yesterday

1114
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:35,420
or today about not, not about Metacritic, but about how well Diablo mortal's doing.

1115
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,420
Yeah.

1116
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,420
Yeah.

1117
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:43,260
That in the first two weeks they've made, was it $24 million?

1118
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:46,140
They've made $24 million in two weeks.

1119
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,140
Great.

1120
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,820
And this is why the behavior is never going to change.

1121
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:51,740
Great job holding that.

1122
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:56,380
Great job dragging this whole thing through the mud, talk and doing these greatest on

1123
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:57,380
scores.

1124
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:00,540
Here is a fucking wake up call.

1125
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:05,980
Those scores on Metacritic do not mean shit.

1126
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:12,780
You are wasting your fucking time writing them.

1127
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:17,860
That $24 million this game just earned, that's what matters.

1128
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:22,740
You fucked up because, and I, you know what, maybe I have to take accountability cause

1129
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,420
I did say I downloaded the game.

1130
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:25,780
I tried it out.

1131
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:31,980
I didn't give them any money, but you know, fine.

1132
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:36,540
I played into the $8 million figure, but I told you it's complicated for a lot of us

1133
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:41,260
because I do know people that worked on that game and deserve to have success even if their

1134
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,780
managers and higher ups don't.

1135
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:50,340
So it's tricky, but I'm just saying this whole Metacritic thing, and this is my point.

1136
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:53,620
It doesn't mean shit when this is happening.

1137
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,580
Like it's, it's a wasted effort.

1138
01:09:55,580 --> 01:10:02,700
Your Metacritic, your change.orgs will do nothing.

1139
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,500
You know what you need to do?

1140
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:10,820
Stop watching the streamers that are spending $15,000 to tell you something you already

1141
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:11,860
know.

1142
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:17,180
And all of these other, and you've got to wonder where's this $24 million come from?

1143
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:21,740
How many streamers have we heard of that are dumping thousands of dollars into this game?

1144
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:26,940
I'm not going to tell you how to spend your money, but where do you think the streamers

1145
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:36,260
got that money to do that from you watching them and doing your biddies and your subs?

1146
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:41,780
They learned it from you in turn enabled this $24 million.

1147
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:48,740
So if you are out there writing these Metacritic reviews and you're watching these streamers

1148
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:53,260
at the same time and giving them money so that they in turn can go pay it in Diablo

1149
01:10:53,260 --> 01:11:01,780
Immortal, you are fucking up.

1150
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:04,460
Rob Roberts, your friend, here to tell it to you like it is.

1151
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,100
Sorry, it's not always cute.

1152
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:14,180
teacher Rob Estin Chat says, ah shit, uncle Rob taking them to school.

1153
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:15,180
You know what?

1154
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:20,460
Sometimes, sometimes you just have to break it down for a bitch.

1155
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:25,300
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I saw a video from James Stephanie Sterling on the Diablo Immortal

1156
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,300
fuckery.

1157
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:29,300
Apparently it costs somewhere in the $100,000 range to max your character.

1158
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:37,580
Yeah, there was a headline going around about that and, but here's, can I, in, in defense

1159
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:43,780
of the frontline workers who worked hard on Diablo Immortal, who maybe had nothing to

1160
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:47,160
do with this whole pay to win scheme.

1161
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:55,020
Is that, do you have to have the best of the best equipment to enjoy the game?

1162
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,580
Because I've played, I mean, I haven't installed it on the new computers.

1163
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:02,140
I haven't really touched it this week, but like I played a good five, six hours without

1164
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:06,740
dropping a dime on the game and I relatively enjoyed myself.

1165
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:11,020
I heard once you get to the end game, you're really, really pressured to spend more money.

1166
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,020
I might.

1167
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:16,340
No, I probably won't actually like if I've gone this long without, yeah, I probably not

1168
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:17,340
going to do it.

1169
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,340
I'm not going to.

1170
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,220
And especially, you know, hearing these stories about how much it takes, I'm not going to

1171
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,300
do it.

1172
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:27,160
Like how hard is it to just not give it money?

1173
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:31,340
And before I understand, there's this whole thing on social media about it's enabling

1174
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:34,460
gambling addiction and it's enabling all this.

1175
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,460
Okay.

1176
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:40,720
At some point you have to take personal accountability for that type of shit.

1177
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:47,000
And if that is a trap for you, then you have to not walk in that, that could be many games

1178
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,600
out there, not just Diablo Immortal.

1179
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,800
Many games are doing this exact same thing.

1180
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:57,700
So I sort of find that argument to be a little bit, but I just, there, there is a way to

1181
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:03,160
enjoy this game and play the game and not spend money.

1182
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:06,440
And DJ Ramesh says, if you need to spend money to beef up your character to beat the game,

1183
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,440
is it really worth playing?

1184
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,440
I would say no.

1185
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,280
And that's the point where I would stop.

1186
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,280
Yeah.

1187
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:16,160
Bonstablo 6 says, I cannot wrap my head around paying and paying and paying to play a game

1188
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,440
or games in general.

1189
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:26,440
You know, I pay a monthly fee to play Final Fantasy 14 online and I don't regret it whatsoever.

1190
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:30,540
I pay money to dress up the survivors I don't play in Dead by Daylight.

1191
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:34,060
So on one hand, you have to spend money on the stuff that makes you happy.

1192
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:40,420
I feel that what I'm paying is justified because I know what I'm getting.

1193
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:43,460
And that's a big difference from this Diablo Immortal situation.

1194
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:47,780
And even when Jamie's talking about playing dress up, she knows what she's getting.

1195
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:52,240
And these games, both Dead by Daylight and Final Fantasy, they continue to support with

1196
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,900
regular updates and so forth that I feel like I'm paying into.

1197
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,420
I think it's, you know, it's, it's that whole thing.

1198
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:58,420
Yeah.

1199
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,180
DJ Ramesh says, I'll pay to remove the ads from the game.

1200
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:02,760
Def says, I'll pay the Pokemon Unite Battle Pass.

1201
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,840
No one is here to tell you how you should spend your money.

1202
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:14,420
But if it costs, I mean, if the odds in Diablo are that shitty to get these items, you kind

1203
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,380
of have to just say no at some point.

1204
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,920
You really do.

1205
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:22,120
And Prince Brightstar in chat says, or the government just outright bans it.

1206
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,440
There are certain countries where people can't play it.

1207
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:32,060
And honestly, I think I'm surprised that Blizzard is not required to publish the odds.

1208
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:37,940
And I think it's just a matter of time before this game gets in front of the lawmakers that

1209
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:38,940
need to see it.

1210
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:41,740
And we're going to see that become a law, at least in some states.

1211
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:45,380
The government is slow, but it's going to happen.

1212
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:46,380
Mark my word.

1213
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:50,940
This game, this game, Diablo Immortal, is going to cause states to pass laws where the

1214
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:55,380
odds have to be transparent.

1215
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:58,140
The government doesn't do a lot, but it'll do that.

1216
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,780
All right.

1217
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,980
As Joe and Hunter Matt wants to point out, also keep in mind that some streamers are

1218
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:08,840
also paid by the devs with in-game currency to spend to make these loot box videos.

1219
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,380
The logic behind it is that if a streamer inspires a viewer to possibly buy into the

1220
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,780
game and its loot boxes, they see it as solid advertising.

1221
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:19,820
EA does this with ultimate team streamers.

1222
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:23,220
It's all that influencer presence.

1223
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:28,460
Because it's also, and this is important, it's also not unique to gaming.

1224
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:36,380
For example, I have a friend who is a drag influencer, and this person got sent a makeup

1225
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:42,100
kit from a makeup company to do an unboxing video on Instagram and show off all the makeup

1226
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,420
to their Instagram followers.

1227
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:50,440
It is the exact same thing, but with makeup.

1228
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:59,720
I get mobile game invites for betas.

1229
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:05,120
So I just all want you to remember, your Diablo Immortal $15,000 spending streams is just

1230
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,120
makeup.

1231
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,120
Remember.

1232
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,080
Hey, makeup's great.

1233
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,760
Like you know what?

1234
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,760
You know, I'm not-

1235
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,760
Mine is.

1236
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:15,760
Yes, your makeup is great.

1237
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:21,360
I know there's been a lot, I think in 2022 we've come a long way with some of these stereotypes,

1238
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,280
but even for guys, you know what?

1239
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,880
A little foundation will cover up a lot of stuff.

1240
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,920
Nail polish, kind of cool.

1241
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,720
Like a lot of rock stars use it.

1242
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:34,060
It's not what it used to be, so anyway.

1243
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,920
The guy liner must return.

1244
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,920
I know, right?

1245
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,480
I kind of miss guy liner.

1246
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:42,440
Quest Buster says, I had to dig to find the odds on drops in Diablo Immortal and found

1247
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,640
out about its version of a pity system.

1248
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,640
In comparison, a gotcha like Genshin Impact literally provides the odds up front for their

1249
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,640
banners.

1250
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,640
Yep.

1251
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,640
Yep.

1252
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,640
All right, let's move on.

1253
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:58,920
Let's talk about a game instead that, you know, isn't going to be a nickel and dime

1254
01:16:58,920 --> 01:16:59,920
thing.

1255
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,920
At least I don't think it is.

1256
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,180
I'd be very depressed if it was.

1257
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:06,240
This is actually a game called Atari Vault, or I'm sorry, excuse me, Atari Mania.

1258
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,040
Atari Vault was a former collection.

1259
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,960
Atari Mania is a collection that was just announced.

1260
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:19,160
It's 150 micro games that are incorporating the 1970s and 80s classic Atari games.

1261
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:25,560
It's going to be coming out on Switch, PC via Steam, and the Atari VCS, remember that?

1262
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:28,960
Finally, it has a game that, you know, but okay.

1263
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,800
But it's coming out on Steam and Switch, and let's be real, that's where most of you are

1264
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,520
going to check it out.

1265
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,600
And it's waiting for them to celebrate Atari's 50th anniversary.

1266
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:41,880
Now here's the thing, I gotta say, in actually looking at the game a little bit, and let

1267
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:45,520
me see if I can pull this up, at least for the Twitch viewers here.

1268
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,920
Let me do a quick little presto change-o on my new setup here to show you what this

1269
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:51,920
looks like.

1270
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,300
I'm sorry, this is a great technical breakthrough.

1271
01:17:55,300 --> 01:18:01,720
Your boxes don't go gray anymore when I switch because you're on the Discord app, I'm sorry.

1272
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,200
I know none of you know what I'm talking about, but I just had a very exciting technical breakthrough

1273
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,200
on this side.

1274
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:11,160
Anyway, but my point is, here we go, on the other screen, this is what the Atari Classics

1275
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,640
look like now in this game.

1276
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,020
So they've, even though we're talking, like that was Yars' Revenge, hold on, let me go

1277
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,120
back in the video there.

1278
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:22,960
That was very clearly, that here, see that, even though it's a little faded, and sorry

1279
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,440
for the folks in the podcast feed, but we're looking at Yars' Revenge, but with very clearly

1280
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,720
some different and upgraded graphics.

1281
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:35,360
So it's not just that they're, again, repackaging all of their old shit and putting it out,

1282
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:39,680
they're actually reimagining a lot of these things, and that part is kind of interesting,

1283
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:40,680
I actually think.

1284
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,200
Like NES Remix, but Atari?

1285
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:49,520
Yeah, kinda, or actually it's NES Remix meets WarioWare meets Atari, because these are micro

1286
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,800
games, they're saying.

1287
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,220
See, that's how they should be doing that kind of stuff.

1288
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:55,360
That's the way to do it.

1289
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,280
That's like the Namco approach almost.

1290
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:01,880
That's why this actually kind of caught my attention, because I was like, wait a minute,

1291
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,860
this is different.

1292
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:08,740
And what is also kind of neat about this is that you have the mashup games, they also

1293
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:15,900
say it is a neo-retro art update to the classic Atari 2600 style, and you can do fully playable

1294
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:21,860
versions in the treasure trove of these remastered Atari classics that you unlock by completing

1295
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:24,860
cheeky challenges, that's how you know it's a British dev.

1296
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:30,180
It's cheeky challenges that you will complete to do this.

1297
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:35,620
So it caught my attention, because you know I love retro shit, my only thing about this

1298
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:41,780
is I'm like, this game, honestly, is like 15 years late.

1299
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,980
This game is 15 years late.

1300
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:48,620
This should have been, like somebody is really late to the party, but alright, they finally

1301
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:52,900
figured out that something like this could be pretty big, so I wish them luck, I really

1302
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:53,900
really do.

1303
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:59,620
So, yeah, let's see, Tigerclass says, I remember that remake of Yars Revenge that wasn't like

1304
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:03,180
the original, it was the game with the name Yars Revenge slapped on it.

1305
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:09,020
That was just Atari selling their IP for a quick buck, because they were otherwise financially

1306
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,060
insolvent.

1307
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,100
So that's all that was.

1308
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:15,060
They did it with Centipede, I think it's or Millipede or one of them.

1309
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,500
Dartisius says, I did pick up the other Atari collection on Switch, but this sounds a lot

1310
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,500
more fun.

1311
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:23,700
Yeah, it's a little jazzed up, and it's a little kind of revisiting those games.

1312
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:29,820
And if you think about it, those Atari 2600 games were kind of micro games.

1313
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:32,540
They were very repetitive.

1314
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:38,620
That's kind of the charm and the zen of them, in my opinion, but video games were very different

1315
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:46,940
when you only had, what, what does 4K translate into, 4,092 characters to code with?

1316
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:51,060
Yeah, your games got a little repetitive, because you only had so much space to actually

1317
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:55,660
code with, and they had to do some really clever things to make things fit in that much

1318
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,660
space.

1319
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,660
So.

1320
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:58,660
All right.

1321
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:03,140
Anyway, before we get to our next story, I see Dark Sakura commenting, Loki, on your

1322
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:06,840
video and some of the characters there, like Deepcoat.

1323
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,160
And I didn't- It's hilarious that it's Deepcoat.

1324
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,620
I didn't ask in the beginning of the show, like I usually do, because I was too distracted

1325
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:14,780
by having to run things tonight.

1326
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:17,120
What is the game playing behind you live on Twitch tonight?

1327
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,060
It's Fashion Police Squad.

1328
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:20,060
Oh.

1329
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:23,020
I think you got Captain Jack hanging out there.

1330
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,020
That's funny.

1331
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,020
Okay.

1332
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,020
It looks pretty awesome.

1333
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:27,200
I want to check that out.

1334
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:30,220
I would take it that Deepcoat is supposed to be a reference to Deepthroat.

1335
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:31,220
Oh, I'm sure.

1336
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,220
I'm sure.

1337
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,220
Yeah.

1338
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:34,220
But that Fashion Police- Look at the history, people.

1339
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:35,220
Looked funny.

1340
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:38,600
Fashion Police is the first person shooter, but it's, you're literally the Fashion Police,

1341
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:43,860
so I mean- It's like Doom, but you're, you know, basically running around and shooting

1342
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:47,820
people to make them, you know, more fashionable.

1343
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,820
Yes.

1344
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,660
You're shooting them with style.

1345
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:53,220
Dark Soccer, one of us needs to play this on stream, or both of us.

1346
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:54,220
It's like fun.

1347
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:55,220
All right.

1348
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:56,220
We'll see.

1349
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:57,220
We'll see.

1350
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:58,220
All right.

1351
01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:59,220
Let's move on.

1352
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:00,220
Dark Soccer, we can go to you.

1353
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,020
Well, how about like super cool games?

1354
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:07,580
Like one of my favorite series is the Raiden series.

1355
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:14,020
And Limited Run Games, bless them, is doing physical releases, actually a combined physical

1356
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:22,500
release of Raiden 4 x Mikado Remix and Raiden 5 Director's Cut Duel.

1357
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:30,500
It's actually the- The Duel Pack is what they're all called together, but anyway, it is like

1358
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:38,820
two of the- I mean, honestly, to me, the pinnacle of the series was Raiden DX Deluxe, but still.

1359
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:43,180
But even so, I think it's really awesome that this is coming out.

1360
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:49,540
They are available separately in the Nintendo eShop, but if you like physical copies and

1361
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:58,100
one of both, the orders are up for the games as of June 21st, which is two days from today

1362
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:01,940
for us here on Sunday, so that'll be Tuesday.

1363
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:11,260
The price will be $49.99 US, and it's honestly, I mean, it's a write-in game.

1364
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:12,480
How could you go wrong?

1365
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:18,560
And also, Raiden 5 Director's Cut had like a cheer attack in it that I thought was kind

1366
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:24,840
of interesting, and voice acting in the series.

1367
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:31,640
So some pretty neat stuff in there, but I mean, come on, you know the weapon everybody

1368
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,920
wants in the Raiden games?

1369
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,200
The electric thing.

1370
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,640
That is the coolest weapon that exists.

1371
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:45,200
Did I ever tell you about the time I beat Raiden on PlayStation while I was drunk on

1372
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,200
Everclear?

1373
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,200
No.

1374
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:52,840
Well, you remember also at my birthday party at Dave & Buster's, when I was playing Luminess

1375
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:57,120
and got to like level 30-something, very drunk.

1376
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:02,100
I don't know what it is, but if I'm like super inebriated like that, I will either completely

1377
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:07,840
bomb something or kick so much ass at it, because I think I'm playing just like on instinct.

1378
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:14,400
That night, after many shots of Everclear, I beat Raiden on PlayStation.

1379
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,600
I don't know how.

1380
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,380
It was magic.

1381
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:19,580
Magical Everclear.

1382
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,580
It certainly was.

1383
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,580
Please drink responsibly.

1384
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,000
I felt like it was magic.

1385
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:29,240
My liver might not have, and also that was the, was it that night or the one in Ocean

1386
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:30,240
Sweets?

1387
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,040
But anyway, it was like, I think that was one of the nights I learned that I can't get

1388
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,040
a hangover.

1389
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,040
Huh.

1390
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,040
All right.

1391
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,240
All right.

1392
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,040
Well, I thought I thought you'd enjoy that story.

1393
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,040
Dark Sakura.

1394
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,040
It seems.

1395
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,040
Yeah, I did.

1396
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,040
I linked it to Dan right away, because why wouldn't we have this?

1397
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:49,440
I mean, probably because we are oh, I need to take a tangent.

1398
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:50,440
OK, it's fine.

1399
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,440
We have room for that tonight.

1400
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:53,440
Yeah.

1401
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,440
So Dan sold Mustang.

1402
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,440
Oh, shit.

1403
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,440
I didn't know that.

1404
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,440
Oh, wow.

1405
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,440
OK.

1406
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,440
He sold it to a friend.

1407
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,440
Keep it in the family.

1408
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,800
And he has started working on converting our garage to a game room.

1409
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,760
I was like, you needed the room in the garage for more pinball machines that badly where

1410
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:08,360
he finally sold the Mustang.

1411
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,440
Well, I want I want them out of the living room for sure.

1412
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,880
I mean, I'd like to actually be able to, you know, go back to doing my weightlifting in

1413
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,880
the living room.

1414
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:16,880
Uh huh.

1415
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:29,040
But he he's already looking into sound tiles to to lay out in it and in the shape of one

1416
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,400
of the Space Invaders.

1417
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,720
Oh, I love that.

1418
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:38,680
And looking into like carpeting options, like I saw some things on our Amazon view list

1419
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,960
because Dan and I share our Amazon account.

1420
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,840
That's so you get to have a garage arcade.

1421
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,320
Loki gets to have a garage arcade with his DDR machine.

1422
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,320
My age.

1423
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,320
You have a garage.

1424
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,320
Yeah.

1425
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,640
My HOA rules force us to park the cars in the garage.

1426
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,200
So whomp.

1427
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,080
But that's why I you know what?

1428
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,080
I have my own office.

1429
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,800
And I said, what you don't see on cam.

1430
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:00,800
I'll show it.

1431
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,000
I'm it's not going to look as good on stream, but I'm thinking about it.

1432
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:10,680
I have a big walk in closet right to the side of where the machine is.

1433
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:14,840
And it would hold about four or five of those arcade one ups very nicely.

1434
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,960
It's actually a full on like you can walk in there and stuff.

1435
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,840
So I'm actually a little bit bigger than mine.

1436
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,840
Yeah.

1437
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,740
I'm thinking about moving the cabinets in there, even though it might not make as good

1438
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:26,480
of a background for when I'm streaming and stuff.

1439
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,520
I think that would be fun.

1440
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:34,200
I'll tell you what one of my friends does with her walk in closet, who's also a podcaster.

1441
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:38,600
She converted her closet completely to a studio.

1442
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:41,920
Oh.

1443
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,920
With sound tiles.

1444
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:43,920
Oh yeah.

1445
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,920
Because lights and things.

1446
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:45,920
It's so yeah.

1447
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:46,920
Noise dampening in there.

1448
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:47,920
Yeah.

1449
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:48,920
Yeah.

1450
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:49,920
It's not a bad idea.

1451
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:50,920
Yeah.

1452
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:51,920
It would be easy to do.

1453
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,280
I mean, you could even, you know, if you really got, you know, interested in it, you could

1454
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:59,120
paint like whatever backdrop chroma key green.

1455
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,120
Yeah.

1456
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:05,440
Cause I was going to say that works well for a podcast only, but for doing the video stuff,

1457
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:09,080
it's not the most engaging background and less, but it sounds like your friend kind

1458
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,360
of did some work arounds to make it better.

1459
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:16,800
So that's why you have like, you know, lights hanging from the door or, you know, neat little

1460
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,520
sign behind you.

1461
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,520
Yeah.

1462
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,520
Anything is possible.

1463
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:21,520
True.

1464
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,520
True.

1465
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:23,520
Yeah.

1466
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,520
All right.

1467
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:29,080
I'm going to be your fashion expert, your interior decorator for decorating closet.

1468
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,960
So you're going to play fashion police IRL.

1469
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,960
No, I'm not going to be a police.

1470
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,760
I'm not going to like shoot people with style.

1471
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:35,760
Oh, okay.

1472
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,360
I'm just going to be like, you could do better.

1473
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:39,360
Okay.

1474
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:44,840
Girl, if you're going to be in the closet, at least make sure the closet is pretty.

1475
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,640
Some good advice here on pride month.

1476
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:47,640
All right.

1477
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:53,320
Let's move on to our next story, Logie.

1478
01:27:54,520 --> 01:28:02,040
So Nintendo has now been striking down YouTube musicians who have been covering different

1479
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:05,320
tracks of Nintendo's properties.

1480
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:14,040
So one of one person that got a strike recently or was Cinemax, who is a child dedicated music

1481
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:20,080
and he was creating he was doing some covers of some Metroid Prime songs.

1482
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:24,160
And apparently that got their attention, which is weird because like I've seen a lot of other

1483
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:27,360
like, I mean, there's so many like Nintendo remixes.

1484
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:33,200
I'm surprised they haven't gone after like, you know, some of these other remix sites

1485
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,200
and stuff.

1486
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:40,160
But apparently, you know, they're sending copyright claims, you know, they have the

1487
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:44,760
legal right to take the content down and, you know, Cinemax acknowledges that the songs

1488
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,680
are owned and copyrighted by Nintendo.

1489
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:54,780
However, you know, doesn't really agree with their aggressive tactics for like kind of

1490
01:28:54,780 --> 01:29:03,080
treating like the fans and people that make fan creations based off of some of their IP.

1491
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,680
So this I found very interesting.

1492
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:10,040
So Bobby got into this on his show tonight and he's in chat kind of reinforcing some

1493
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,240
of the same stuff he got into on his show.

1494
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:17,640
And I thought he made a damn good point about this whole story is he said that in the story

1495
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:21,720
that the person who got the copyright claim or whatever said they were called by Nintendo's

1496
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,680
lawyers to take him down.

1497
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:28,240
We have to stop and think about that statement for a minute.

1498
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:32,220
Since when have Nintendo's lawyers ever talked to people on the phone?

1499
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:34,480
And I guess it's never they're not going to do that.

1500
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:41,260
They're not going to do that because if it's legal, they have to have proof that it happened.

1501
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:45,600
And the way that there's you can't prove a phone conversation because recording recorded

1502
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,840
conversations are not a miserable evidence.

1503
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:54,320
The proof is a registered or certified letter that is in writing that you mailed to the

1504
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,320
person or the company or whoever the offending is.

1505
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,840
That's why it's a cease and desist letter that you always hear.

1506
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:01,840
That's why it's the term.

1507
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,540
It's never a cease and desist phone call.

1508
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:09,400
And also with it being in writing from attorney also makes it privileged information.

1509
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,080
Sorry, I had a little spill here.

1510
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:15,560
So Loki, I'm not trying to step on your toes or anything, but I'm pointing out something

1511
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:21,200
that's interesting that's happening here with the internet wildfire of this story that's

1512
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,320
going on.

1513
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:27,520
And I get everybody likes to dunk on Nintendo's copyright thing.

1514
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:33,040
And they've earned this, that people are able to jump to this conclusion.

1515
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:40,260
But something doesn't add up and I'm not, you know, again, I, but I'm not saying, I'm

1516
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:46,860
not saying that this person is necessarily lying because somebody else who had a beef

1517
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:52,700
with this person could have called posing to be Nintendo's lawyers and doing this whole

1518
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:53,700
thing.

1519
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:57,500
So I'm not saying this person is necessarily a bad actor at face value.

1520
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:01,060
I wouldn't want to say that because then his lawyers could send me a letter accusing me

1521
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:07,380
of something, but I'm just saying lawyers don't call people.

1522
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:08,700
Something doesn't add up here.

1523
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,260
It is a little strange.

1524
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:18,600
The only remote thing that I could even think of to give it some feasibility is if the guy

1525
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:25,060
actually had like a buddy that worked at Nintendo and someone gave him a warning or I don't,

1526
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:30,140
that wouldn't even be, that's like the only thing I could remotely think.

1527
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:32,060
I can see.

1528
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:33,060
Yeah.

1529
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,980
I don't know if, but I, yeah.

1530
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:39,220
And like maybe somebody is doing the phone call as a favor and that whole thing where

1531
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:43,100
it's like, it gets translated into, I was told to stop.

1532
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:48,580
No, a friend told you, you should stop or else the lawyer's going to get involved.

1533
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:51,040
But you took that to here.

1534
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:54,300
I got told to stop by the lawyer.

1535
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:57,660
Let that, and we all, we can all think of a case in our lives, whether it happened to

1536
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:02,060
us or somebody else where that game of telephone absolutely played out.

1537
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:03,060
It is really weird though.

1538
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:08,300
Cause like I, there's so many, I mean, unless they were really close to like the original

1539
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:13,580
pieces of music, I mean, there's so many Nintendo music channels out there that are

1540
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:19,900
just like remixes and like, I just, it doesn't make any sense.

1541
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:24,580
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, also this cover artist only has about 7K subs, not a big fish

1542
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:25,860
in the cover music pond.

1543
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:28,260
So this is great for your attention.

1544
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:29,260
So yeah.

1545
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:32,720
And again, Loki, I'm not, you know, you're, you're just bringing, again, this is a show

1546
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:35,300
about video games and video game culture.

1547
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,200
And this story is everywhere right now.

1548
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,720
And that's why I'm saying, hold up, tap the break because we do have a tendency sometimes

1549
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:46,900
to copy paste these stories, these headlines and things to share on social media without

1550
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,740
stopping to look and say, does the math add up?

1551
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:53,280
Because there's a question mark here.

1552
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:59,360
And again, it might not be this, you know, I, it might not be the individual, the cover

1553
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:07,000
artist is probably could, could for all we know, completely be accounting the truth as

1554
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,280
they see it.

1555
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:15,560
But as SSJ 100 Matt says in chat, and this is it, nail meathead, if people can swat someone,

1556
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,720
they can fake a Nintendo lawyer call.

1557
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:22,160
Yeah, I mean, it makes sense.

1558
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:27,040
So anyway, just something to think about.

1559
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,760
Let's see, yeah, Mike Defton chat says not to make them less.

1560
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:36,480
Yeah, I mean, like, and I will sit here and say, this guy has more subs than our podcast

1561
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,000
does.

1562
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,080
So kudos to him on that.

1563
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,800
There are way bigger remix channels and haven't got struck down or something.

1564
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,680
Yeah, it's a little weird.

1565
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:49,360
Like, why would you go after the little guy unless, unless your video game covers were laced

1566
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:54,320
with disparaging comments about Nintendo or something or false accusation?

1567
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,920
I'm not saying they are, I'm just saying that might be a way that your smaller channel would

1568
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,000
get more attention.

1569
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,440
But I don't think that's the case here.

1570
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:06,520
So, so you know what I just said, since we're a small podcast, we can say anything we want.

1571
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,560
I know, just so much freedom.

1572
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:19,920
Although the one time we did say something that somebody didn't like, somebody did get a phone

1573
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,880
call, actually, now that I think about it, but we won't go there.

1574
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,960
This is a time of celebration.

1575
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:27,840
All right.

1576
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:28,880
Oh, you.

1577
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:33,160
Moving on, let's go to our next story.

1578
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:38,280
Oh, this is one that I thought was pretty cool, because this is like a one from the vaults type of

1579
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:38,720
story.

1580
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:43,240
This is about an unreleased NES prototype that has come to light.

1581
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,800
It is the game The Fairyland Story.

1582
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:52,520
It was originally in arcades in 1985, and now we have found that this was being ported at one

1583
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:58,960
point to the NES by Hard Four Games and Forest of Illusion, I think are the ones that actually

1584
01:34:58,960 --> 01:34:59,840
found this game.

1585
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,720
But it was going to be released in 86, 87.

1586
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,880
It had a brief mention in a Japanese magazine.

1587
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:06,800
It didn't happen.

1588
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,520
There were some differences from the arcade game, such as there's only 50 levels in the game

1589
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,320
instead of 101 and the 50 loop over and over.

1590
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:21,680
But what's kind of neat is that this old ROM has been rediscovered.

1591
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,320
So you can check that out.

1592
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,640
Also, it should be pointed out.

1593
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:31,480
There is this NES original, but if you want to support the real thing, it's also on arcade

1594
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:34,400
archives, because you know how Nintendo has that whole arcade.

1595
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:39,720
I've seen PlayStation 4 and 5 have it too, is the arcade archives.

1596
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:43,080
If you actually want to play the original arcade version, but if you want to play the

1597
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:46,160
unreleased version, that ROM is out there on the Internet.

1598
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:49,440
It's not hard to find because this story is everywhere right now.

1599
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,200
But I'll give you a hint, forestdelusion.com is the site that hasn't.

1600
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,680
So I think it's kind of neat.

1601
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:59,920
It's always neat to see games that like we weren't supposed to see.

1602
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,360
So it's a little piece of gaming history.

1603
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:10,360
I might have already gotten the ROM right after it came out.

1604
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,080
Did you play it yet?

1605
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:13,120
No, not yet.

1606
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:17,640
I remember I've been playing through a bunch of other stuff, so it's back there.

1607
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:26,000
I have a few other prototypes actually that I need to take a look at, like, hold on, I'm

1608
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,760
actually going to pull up the list of the ones I need to play.

1609
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:41,880
But I've got like Bio Force Ape and I have Fairyland, I have Fighting Golf.

1610
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,960
I have another one called Hattori.

1611
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:55,400
So I also have a prototype of Rensaber, Star Soldier prototype for the NES.

1612
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,320
Random stuff.

1613
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,640
Yeah, just really, really random.

1614
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:01,240
All right.

1615
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:06,200
Well, since we brought up classic games, I think it's a great segue into our next segment.

1616
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:24,200
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1617
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,400
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1618
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:33,480
But once a month, DarkSakura says, you know what, I'm going to mix it up and pick a classic electronic handheld.

1619
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,560
So what is the classic handheld of the month?

1620
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,240
We have a digital monster.

1621
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:52,000
Basically, when Bandai released the Tamagotchi, they also released a, you know, just because the Tamagotchi was really marketed more for like girls.

1622
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:01,680
So in true gendered, you know, tradition, they released one for the boys called the digital monster or Digimon.

1623
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:07,560
It was, you know, it's another type of virtual pet, but this one could be a fighting pet.

1624
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:18,600
So you would, you know, raise your pet and then you had these little, like these little connectors at the bottom where your Digimon could battle or more like at the top.

1625
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,720
But going back to it, let's just start with a little bit of history on it.

1626
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:29,680
So it was released by Bandai on June 26, 1997 in Japan and December 5, 1997 in North America.

1627
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:44,000
The original digital monster model sold 14 million units worldwide, including 13 million in Japan and 1 million overseas by March 2004.

1628
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:55,800
And by 2005, it had, there were more than 24 million digital monster units sold worldwide.

1629
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:08,560
In 2017, they did a 20th anniversary edition that was released in Japan that let the owner choose any of the eggs from the first five versions of the toy and then some new unlocked ones through various different methods.

1630
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:15,720
And that came out worldwide in 2019, which was the anniversary outside of Japan.

1631
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:20,800
So we're going to go ahead and start with just the basics with this.

1632
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:45,800
I mean, you can see in the video for those who are watching, you know, feed them a little squishy, whatever, Mon, but you can check the pet status, age, weight, strength, hunger, energy, or feed the Digimon to make him full, increase its strength, increase its energy, you know, train the Digimon so that it loses weight and increases strength.

1633
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:56,800
You have your battle mode where you link the two together through these little readers on the top, and then they can have a battle.

1634
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:08,800
You can also clean up their poo. If you don't clean up their poo, the Digimon becomes sick. You can toggle the light, like, okay, it's that right here in the video is what the little connectors look like.

1635
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:28,800
But you can turn the light on and off in this little virtual house so that the Digimon can sleep. If you leave the light on while they're sleeping, then their condition decreases and you would not have a chance of a high powered evolution.

1636
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:39,800
And then there's healing your Digimon. If your Digimon gets sick or injured in battle, you would have to heal them before they can battle again.

1637
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:47,800
So the original Digimon device had three buttons and a reset button all on the right hand side of the screen.

1638
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:55,800
There's A to go through your icons and options. The middle B would activate the function and C cancels whatever is on the screen.

1639
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:11,800
And pressing A and C simultaneously toggles the sound, which, you know, mutes or unmutes in the reset button, is that little tiny hole that was between the B and C button and you would have to use like a pen or a pen to do the reset.

1640
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:23,800
The metal contacts is where they would touch to be able to communicate. Well, that wasn't all for Digimon.

1641
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:35,800
So we got, in 1998, the Pendulum series came out that introduced the Jogress function. So you could combine your Digimon.

1642
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:55,800
The Pendulum would count the number of times the device has been shaken. And then there was the Pendulum Progress series. After that, the Pendulum X series that was accompanied by Digimon Chronicle for the, it was a story that came out.

1643
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:14,800
There was Digimon Mini. There was a Wonderswan that had the original Digimon as a game. There's the 20th Anniversary one, Digimon Pendulum 20th Anniversary, Digimon X, which was the original one that had the 20th Anniversary features, and the Pendulum X series.

1644
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:27,800
There's Digimon Pendulum Z. All kinds of stuff. I mean, well, and then let's not forget what spawned from this little, you know, brick looking thing.

1645
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:47,800
We had the Digimon, there were Digimon anime that, and you know how I feel about the Digimon anime. I think that the first two series are super superior to basically any other thing.

1646
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:59,800
And then Digimon Tribe makes my heart happy and a little bit sad in some ways. There's also a manga called Come On Digimon. There were just all kinds of stuff in it.

1647
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:19,800
And then I also had like the, the D3, which were the, actually I had a Digivice and Dan gave it to Julie. And I kept saying, don't give it to her. It's mine. You cannot give something that is mine to somebody else.

1648
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:32,800
And I still want it back to this day, but no one knows where anything is at Julie's house. And then I had the, the D3 and I had the black D3 with the little laptop thingy that they had.

1649
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:42,800
Cause I, like I said, I was super into Digimon 02 and I actually ended up giving them to a friend who was a really big fan only to realize that the D3, the black D3 was the short pack.

1650
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:59,800
So, oh well. So yeah, I mean, there has been like nine Digimon series and a bunch of films and a bunch of games and a bunch of manga.

1651
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:14,800
And there was a Ma Hua in China. There was a Dark Horse comics. There's a Italian one or called, done by a group called Panini.

1652
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:31,800
It was, it's just, there's the card game. There's a card game too. So, I mean, there's just all kinds of merchandising and it all came from this little brick, this little brick wall looking thing.

1653
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:49,800
And I had the blue one. My, I would always somehow or another evolve a Devimon without fail. I don't know how, but I always had a Devimon. So, and there we go. It is, it's the digital monster.

1654
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:59,800
A quick comment from our chat where as Joe and Hunter Matt says, oh God, I remember confiscating these from kids when I was summer camp counselor, and of course returning them at the end of the day.

1655
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:06,800
We did this because they would always lose it and then we'd have to hear about it or run around hunting them down. Those kids were five at the time.

1656
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:12,800
Now those kids are going to be 28 to 29 now. BRB going to find a corner to rock and cry in the fetal position for a bit.

1657
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:25,800
Glad you could feel the same thing. We feel a lot here on this program. But yeah, these things, these things are also very well known for getting taken away from kids at school quite often.

1658
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:37,800
We were all like in our early twenties and we all had our Digimon and our pocket Pikachu. And I had my Puyo Lin because I was cooler than everybody.

1659
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,800
What's a Puyo Lin? Puyo Puyo is the best. Shut up.

1660
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,800
I was gonna say, I'm pretty sure I had it like a Tamagotchi in like college.

1661
01:45:46,800 --> 01:46:02,800
Yeah. Well, I mean, I remember it was just like, we would always bust a mountain, see who would win. And we were like different like, and everyone like else, like had their Tamagotchi and we had our Digimon and we're like, we're edgier. We're cooler.

1662
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,800
So we're so fucking edgy.

1663
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:12,800
All right. Let's travel around and check out some edgy headlines. No, literally, they're on the edge of tonight's show. Roll just a few quick headlines.

1664
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,800
You'll pay for the whole seat, but you'll only need the edge.

1665
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,800
Some rapid fire news. Loki, why don't you start us off?

1666
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:33,800
I'll leave it up to modders to put in characters in the games that they wanted, but never got. So we have Chrono from Chrono Trigger being added to Smash Brothers Ultimate.

1667
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:43,800
I'm not sure who this character actually replaces, but it even gives Kirby a custom outfit as well, which is kind of funny.

1668
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:49,800
It's an, I'm sorry, Chrono is an alternative costume for Hero from Dragon Quest.

1669
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:50,800
That makes sense.

1670
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:51,800
Neat.

1671
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,800
Character model looks really good.

1672
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,800
Yeah, it does. It looks pretty cool.

1673
01:46:55,800 --> 01:47:01,800
And I'm really impressed with modding communities. This is amazing.

1674
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:12,800
And then we have the Nintendo 64 version of Pokemon Snap coming to the Nintendo Switch online on June 24th as part of the online expansion pack.

1675
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:16,800
I'm paying for it still.

1676
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:22,800
I know. I was like, honestly, this is the most compelling case yet for me to maybe sign up for that pack.

1677
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:25,800
You know, I still don't have it after all this time. Never got the expansion.

1678
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:29,800
Maybe, maybe I'll break one of these days. We'll see. But not yet.

1679
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:33,800
All right. Let's go to Dark Soccer.

1680
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:35,800
I think you have one quick story.

1681
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:38,800
Treasure. Treasure is one of my favorite companies.

1682
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:48,800
They have given me so many wonderful games, including one of my husband's favorite games, Gunstar Heroes and Silhouette Mirage.

1683
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:54,800
And Doki Doki Mischief Makers, Wario World, Sin and Punishment.

1684
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:07,800
But there was a tweet put out by by Treasure's Twitter that said that they are working on a highly requested title in a tweet that was celebrating their 30th anniversary.

1685
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:14,800
It roughly translates to on June 19th, 2022, Treasure Inc celebrates its 30th anniversary.

1686
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:21,800
In this 30th anniversary year, we are working hard to release quote that unquote title that has been requested by many of you.

1687
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:26,800
We look forward to your continued support of Treasure.

1688
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,800
We don't know what it'll be.

1689
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:32,800
I think that the the byline on this one is please be Sin and Punishment three.

1690
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,800
It'll be that game.

1691
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,800
They just it's that it's a game called that.

1692
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:41,800
I would like another Silhouette Mirage.

1693
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:42,800
We'll see. We'll see.

1694
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,800
They did it. They did a Gunstar Heroes follow up.

1695
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:46,800
Yeah.

1696
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,800
So I wonder if it'll be a Sin and Punishment three.

1697
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,800
I bet a lot of people would be very happy to see that.

1698
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:53,800
So, yeah.

1699
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:54,800
All right.

1700
01:48:54,800 --> 01:49:04,800
Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games you'll be playing a lot sooner than you will Sin and Punishment three.

1701
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:06,800
I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games.

1702
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,800
I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games.

1703
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:10,800
I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games.

1704
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:25,800
I don't imagine there's going to be a lot of games this week, but we've got looks like Fall Guys getting a release on PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series and Nintendo Switch.

1705
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:32,800
Shadowrun trilogy is going to be out on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

1706
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,800
We've got Wreckfest coming to Nintendo Switch.

1707
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:45,800
And then, let's see, Sonic Origins on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

1708
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:53,800
AI, the Sonium Files, Nirvana Initiative on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1709
01:49:53,800 --> 01:50:00,800
Capcom Fighting Collection on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

1710
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:06,800
And last but not least, Fire Emblem Three Hopes on Nintendo Switch.

1711
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:14,800
Going over to Japan. Yeah, it's a it's a fairly busy week there and some of the same tentpole games that Loki said for the US are also hitting Japan the same week.

1712
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,800
That includes Fire Emblem Warriors Three Hopes on the Switch.

1713
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:23,800
Also on the Switch, we have the Capcom Fighting Collection making its way there as well.

1714
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:28,800
We also have that AI Somnium Files Nirvana Initiative that Loki referenced.

1715
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,800
We also have a game called Nine Nine.

1716
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,800
So it's the number nine and then it's the word nine spelled out.

1717
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,800
That is also coming out in Japan.

1718
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:39,800
And it looks like it looks like another like dating sim type of thing.

1719
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,800
So we'll leave it at that.

1720
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:42,800
I think a visual novel though.

1721
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,800
Yeah, visual novel type of thing.

1722
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:48,800
Ayoku no Istuya, Angel's Blessing in a regular limited edition.

1723
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:51,800
Miike no Looper Celia in a regular limited edition.

1724
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:55,800
Also hitting the Switch this week and Code Realize future blessings.

1725
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:57,800
Also making its way out to Japan this week.

1726
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:01,800
All of that on the Switch on the PlayStation five this week.

1727
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:03,800
Nothing.

1728
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:08,800
But the PlayStation four sees many of those same releases we already outlined on the Switch.

1729
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,800
I don't really see a whole lot of differences or anything unique.

1730
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,800
It's pretty much a lot of the same games I've seen.

1731
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,800
So we'll go over to Japan, Dark Sakura.

1732
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:18,800
We're going to Europe.

1733
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,800
I'm sorry.

1734
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:22,800
We're going to leave Japan and go to Europe.

1735
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:27,800
On the 21st for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch, we have Zorro the Chronicles.

1736
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:30,800
Also on the 21st for Switch, we have Wreckfest.

1737
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:34,800
On the 23rd for PlayStation, we have Audubon Police Simulator 3.

1738
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,800
And on the 24th for Switch, we have Fire Emblem Warriors 3.

1739
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:39,800
And that's it.

1740
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:40,800
All right.

1741
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,800
Got a few titles there that are coming out worldwide.

1742
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:44,800
All right.

1743
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,800
Well, that was all we had for headlines tonight.

1744
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:50,800
So we get to go to have an empty mailbox.

1745
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:51,800
We have an empty mailbox.

1746
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:52,800
That's a shame.

1747
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,800
I just want to point.

1748
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:57,800
I don't want to guilt you all or anything, but I do want to point out next week is our

1749
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:00,800
20th anniversary.

1750
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,800
And Rob, what do you want to say?

1751
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,800
I want to point out that next week is our 20th anniversary.

1752
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:07,800
And Rob wants to make me work.

1753
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:08,800
I'd love to hear you.

1754
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,800
I'm willing to share the responsibilities if we were to actually get flooded with emails,

1755
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:17,800
especially some of you we haven't heard from in a very long time or ever.

1756
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:21,800
Consider this your cordial invitation to email us.

1757
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:23,800
Participate at orangelaundry.com.

1758
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:24,800
Are you lazy?

1759
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:25,800
Fine.

1760
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:26,800
Write a tweet at OLR.

1761
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,800
I don't always read the tweets, but I'll read them next week.

1762
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:29,800
Do?

1763
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:30,800
What's that?

1764
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:31,800
Voice to text.

1765
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:32,800
Yeah.

1766
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:33,800
Dictation.

1767
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:34,800
Yeah.

1768
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:35,800
Yeah.

1769
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:36,800
Just any of that.

1770
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:41,800
Uh, I would just love to hear since it is the 20 year anniversary, just tell us like,

1771
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,800
what, why do you listen?

1772
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,800
Like, what, what can we do more of?

1773
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:47,800
What do you like?

1774
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:48,800
What do you not like?

1775
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,800
You know what?

1776
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:50,800
It's a birthday show.

1777
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:51,800
Don't tell us what you don't like.

1778
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:52,800
Tell us what you like.

1779
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:55,800
Then the next week, tell us what you don't like.

1780
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:58,800
Um, tell us how you started listening to us and what's kept you here.

1781
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,800
I just, I would love to hear from you.

1782
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,800
So, uh, yeah.

1783
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,800
Send us those emails, tweets, whatever.

1784
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,800
Sure.

1785
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:06,800
TikTok says Bobby Black Wolf.

1786
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:07,800
Why not?

1787
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:08,800
Why not?

1788
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,960
But in the meantime, we do have our green room.

1789
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:16,640
We have live phone calls, uh, available and we do have somebody who wants to call in tonight.

1790
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:18,560
So I think we should get to that person.

1791
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,560
Hello.

1792
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:20,560
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1793
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:21,560
Who's this?

1794
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:23,260
Hey, it's the one and only Rama.

1795
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:24,320
How is everybody doing tonight?

1796
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:25,680
I am doing great.

1797
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:26,800
And it's great to hear from you.

1798
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:27,800
Rama.

1799
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:28,800
How are you?

1800
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:29,800
Good.

1801
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:30,800
Good.

1802
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:31,800
There we go.

1803
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:34,080
I love having an extended vacation, extended weekend.

1804
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,080
You know.

1805
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:36,080
How did we lose Loki?

1806
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,640
Well, Happy Juneteenth.

1807
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:38,640
Now on this.

1808
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:39,640
Thank you.

1809
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:40,640
Thank you.

1810
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:41,640
All right.

1811
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:47,240
Now, so while I fix the camera, to what do we owe this lovely phone call tonight?

1812
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:48,280
A couple of things.

1813
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:59,040
Number one, Final Fantasy 7, I just want to say, as I played through the game, I noticed

1814
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,040
some differences.

1815
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:03,720
I'm just like, okay, let's see where this goes.

1816
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:08,880
When I finished the first game, I was talking to one of my besties, Chibi Tifa.

1817
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:14,760
We basically said, by the time you finish the first game, if you don't realize this

1818
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:20,600
is not the original FF7 you're playing, you need to go back to the drawing board.

1819
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:25,440
We were watching people on Twitter lose their proverbial shit over this because they're

1820
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:31,560
getting angry and upset at how much this deviates from the original.

1821
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:35,480
As somebody who has played through the original game, I'm all for it.

1822
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:39,640
I don't know how you could miss that it deviates from the original.

1823
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:42,600
Again, I'm not trying to spoil every detail.

1824
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:48,280
They kill someone who wasn't killed in the original as a way to explain that this is

1825
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:49,280
different.

1826
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,320
Rob, it's been 25 years.

1827
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:52,320
Spoil away.

1828
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,320
I'm sorry.

1829
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:54,320
Like y'all said earlier.

1830
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:55,320
In the remakes.

1831
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:57,320
The remake's two years old, so yeah.

1832
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:58,320
Okay.

1833
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,080
The remake's been two years.

1834
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,600
It's dirt cheap now.

1835
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:03,960
It's been on PlayStation Plus.

1836
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:04,960
I'm sorry.

1837
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:07,040
There's no NDA on spoiling it at this point.

1838
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,040
Yes, I know.

1839
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:09,040
I know.

1840
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,760
But I'm going to leave it at that.

1841
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:12,920
I made my point.

1842
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:15,840
I'll leave it at that.

1843
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:18,360
People are quite upset about this.

1844
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:20,840
I get it and I understand it.

1845
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:27,280
I'm like this, here's a chance to retell the entire series.

1846
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:32,880
I mean, hell, if you have the official strategy guide, it has everything listed out for eras,

1847
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:37,280
weapons, all of that, and you mean to tell me in the original game, the only way I could

1848
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:40,080
play her after she dies is to use a GameShark?

1849
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:41,080
Come on.

1850
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:42,080
Come on.

1851
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:46,200
Well, you know, it's for plot purposes.

1852
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:49,680
What do you think about the whole renaming of the game too?

1853
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:52,900
Because a lot of people were expecting it would be called Remake Part 2, but now we

1854
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:55,240
know that the game is called Rebirth.

1855
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:57,540
What did you think when you heard the title?

1856
01:55:57,540 --> 01:56:04,000
I was legitimately curious because I could not put my finger on it as to why it's Rebirth,

1857
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,160
but you nailed it.

1858
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:07,160
You nailed it.

1859
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:12,400
That makes the most amount of sense because part one, yes, it's a remake.

1860
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:17,800
Going back to the board, they're remaking certain things, they're fleshing certain stories

1861
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:20,620
about certain tropes, characters.

1862
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:25,840
By the time you finish the first game, you automatically know it's going somewhere else.

1863
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:31,920
So that Rebirth, all right, it's like, we're going to go back to the drawing board one

1864
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,000
more time.

1865
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,360
We're going to do things way different and we're going to go in a different direction.

1866
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:42,160
I'm going to place money on the third part being called Resurrected or Resurrection,

1867
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,260
some form of that.

1868
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:45,040
I'm going to say this.

1869
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,620
There is the particular character that dies.

1870
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:51,880
Now we all know originally she was killed.

1871
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:59,040
I believe in the new trilogy, if she does die, it's her choice.

1872
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:05,060
She understands everything that's going on and it's her choice to do it.

1873
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:06,060
Yes.

1874
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:07,060
Yes.

1875
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:11,500
I think that will be a very big element that couldn't be explored in the original.

1876
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:15,380
I think you're spot on with that and you can say it's Eryth because again, for the 25 year

1877
01:57:15,380 --> 01:57:19,500
old game, I don't care about the spoiler, for the two year old game, I'll try to watch

1878
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,980
my mouth and that's all you get.

1879
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:27,680
But I'm not going to, if it falls out, if I say, oops.

1880
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:31,740
But as far as that goes, I think you're absolutely right.

1881
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:39,020
I think if she does die, she wanted to, or she felt a need that she had to, which was

1882
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:40,800
kind of that way in the original.

1883
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,820
She felt she had to.

1884
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:48,180
But yeah, I think it's going to be a lot more explicit in a way that it wasn't before.

1885
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:53,140
Ooh, Bobby Black Wolf suggests Resolution as the third game title.

1886
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:54,140
Oh, I like that.

1887
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:55,140
I like that.

1888
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:56,140
That could work, yeah.

1889
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:59,140
Re-vengeance says Mike Deft.

1890
01:57:59,140 --> 01:58:00,140
No.

1891
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:01,140
Re-vengeance.

1892
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:07,580
Revolution, like Dance Dance Revolution, but people will get the wrong, people wouldn't

1893
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:08,860
get that reference, so nevermind.

1894
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:10,340
I'm trying to think what other RE.

1895
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:16,340
Questmaster says Restoration, ah, OK, OK, Restoration.

1896
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:17,940
Like restoring the original timeline.

1897
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:18,940
We'll see.

1898
01:58:18,940 --> 01:58:19,940
I don't know.

1899
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:20,940
I don't know.

1900
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:21,940
I'll say this much.

1901
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:25,300
At least I have time to get a PlayStation 5, you know?

1902
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:26,300
Yeah, right.

1903
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:27,300
That's where I'm at.

1904
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:34,460
Final Fantasy XVI and VII Rebirth are in 2023, then I have until 2023.

1905
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:39,640
And it seems very obvious, XVI is loading up the first half of the year, Rebirth is

1906
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:42,480
bringing up the rear, so if they even make it.

1907
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,240
I don't think it'll make it.

1908
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:49,080
I'm still a little salty that, you know, they didn't announce it for Xbox Series X, even

1909
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:55,680
though both consoles are basically the same, I would assume as exclusivity, I'm not really

1910
01:58:55,680 --> 01:59:00,400
upset by it, because I said from jump, I'm going to get both consoles.

1911
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:07,040
And right now, there's only two games on PS5 that I want, and one of them is on PS4 now.

1912
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,240
I'm not even too worried about it.

1913
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:12,400
I'll get both consoles as well, love my Series X, but yeah, there's just going to be stuff

1914
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:13,920
I need to get a PS5 for.

1915
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:17,360
The only reason I'm holding out now is I'm just holding out to see if they do a hardware

1916
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:18,360
refresh.

1917
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,360
That's it.

1918
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:23,080
Because I know otherwise the minute I buy one, oh, the PS5 Mini or the PS5 Pro or the

1919
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:27,360
PS5B, whatever is going to come out.

1920
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:32,280
I'm seeing now at the point where when they announce PlayStation 5s are available, you

1921
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:35,240
can actually, you don't have to rush the websites to get it.

1922
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:39,680
I've seen them sitting online for up to a day before they're sold out.

1923
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:44,800
So I'm like, at least I have a fighting chance, at least now I can be like, do I really want

1924
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:45,800
one?

1925
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:49,360
Yeah, it's started a website, sold out, I'll wait for the next one.

1926
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:54,040
You know what else is partially to thank?

1927
01:59:54,040 --> 02:00:04,160
Bitcoin eating shit, because now Bitcoin and let's be clear, Ramen, before we toast, let's

1928
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:10,000
be clear, all cryptocurrency eating massive shit.

1929
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Okay.

1930
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Okay.

1931
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
All right.

1932
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Okay.

1933
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Okay.

1934
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:19,840
I wanted to talk about Shredder's Revenge, but back away, I've only told two people this.

1935
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:24,080
I'm going to tell you all this because y'all are awesome and y'all not going to judge me

1936
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:25,600
and I still don't care.

1937
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:35,160
I just want you to know from September of last year to I would say January of this year,

1938
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:43,360
I have lost about $7,500 in crypto, but here's the thing, I'm not upset by it.

1939
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,240
I'm not really worried by it.

1940
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:50,680
I've been investing in crypto for like three, four years, total of like three grand.

1941
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:52,960
It was a long-term investment.

1942
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:58,880
It was just something where after everything is said and done, I'm retiring, cash it out.

1943
02:00:58,880 --> 02:00:59,880
That's all that was.

1944
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:04,440
And I'm looking at my account, I'm just like, I got my 401k, I got this, I ain't worried

1945
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:05,440
about it.

1946
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:09,880
It's just a long-term thing for me.

1947
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:11,240
If you want to judge me, go right ahead.

1948
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:12,240
I'm not going to judge you.

1949
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:14,080
Some people foolishly dumped everything in it.

1950
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:15,080
Yeah.

1951
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:19,100
I'm not going to judge you because I got on the hype wagon for like maybe for my Reno

1952
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:21,840
budget in 2021, $150.

1953
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:25,240
That's it.

1954
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:30,200
I put in like $5 and cashed it out at $10.

1955
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:31,200
Good job.

1956
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:33,040
You're the only one that made money.

1957
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:34,040
I did Ethereum.

1958
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:36,280
That's why I did too.

1959
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:39,880
So at least you have a good attitude about it, Rama.

1960
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:43,240
So here's to fucking up.

1961
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:45,080
And I started noticing going down, like, you know what?

1962
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:46,080
I'm going to stop investing.

1963
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:47,680
I'm going to leave it right here.

1964
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:51,880
I'm just going to let whatever's in there roll over and it's slowly making its way back

1965
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:52,880
up.

1966
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:55,760
If it hits the original amount by end of the year, good.

1967
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:58,160
If it does not, is what it is.

1968
02:01:58,160 --> 02:01:59,720
I can still pay my bills.

1969
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:01,360
I can still live my life.

1970
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:05,880
I'm not knocking on relatives door begging for money because I dropped my entire paycheck

1971
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:07,920
into crypto.

1972
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,480
You know, it's kind of funny.

1973
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:15,180
It's like, I'm anti NFT, but I'm okay with crypto because I kind of know you're going

1974
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:17,000
to get something out of crypto.

1975
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,480
NFT is like a photocopy receipt.

1976
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:26,820
And Matt in chat has this and says, main thing is you're not a crypto bro that is calling

1977
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:28,440
a sheep and that we're wrong.

1978
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:29,440
Yes.

1979
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,440
That's the clear difference.

1980
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:31,640
You're a big boy.

1981
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:33,480
You made a big boy decision.

1982
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:35,940
A big boy consequence happened.

1983
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:41,120
And you're just going to have a big boy attitude and say, well, I knew the risk, oops.

1984
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:42,200
I'm like, I lost.

1985
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:43,200
It is what it is.

1986
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:44,480
I'm not crying.

1987
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:49,280
You know, it's like, it's just like playing the stock market half the time.

1988
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,280
Yeah, exactly.

1989
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:51,280
Exactly.

1990
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:52,280
Always remember.

1991
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:54,620
And Questmaster says, always remember, it could have been much, much worse.

1992
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:57,820
Never invest or bet more than you can stomach to lose.

1993
02:02:57,820 --> 02:03:05,120
Very good advice, especially true with Diablo Immortal and other gotcha games out there.

1994
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:09,720
I also don't understand why Metacritic shreds the shit out of Diablo Immortal.

1995
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:12,160
Well, I do, but listen to my full statement here.

1996
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:17,120
I don't understand why Metacritic shreds the shit out of that game and not plenty of

1997
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:20,720
other games out there that are just as guilty.

1998
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:23,840
I think because of the name that's attached to it.

1999
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:24,840
Of course it is.

2000
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:25,840
Of course it is.

2001
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:26,840
Do you think-

2002
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:27,840
High expectations.

2003
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:32,760
Do you, do you know what a fuck fest that Nino, I don't know how else to describe it.

2004
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:37,640
Do you know what a fuck fest that Nino Cooney game is that just came out?

2005
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:39,640
Like that game is a mess.

2006
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:40,640
Don't get me started.

2007
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:41,640
Do not get me started.

2008
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:43,440
That game is a mess.

2009
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:45,240
She's messy, your honor.

2010
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:48,760
You have been found guilty of public mess.

2011
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,640
You have been a mess.

2012
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:53,720
Rob, the last mobile game-

2013
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:57,120
Mario Kondo can't even fix you, Nino Cooney.

2014
02:03:57,120 --> 02:04:04,600
Look, the last game I actually devoted my time away into playing with Sailor Moon Drops

2015
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:06,760
until they shut the servers down.

2016
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:08,360
I wouldn't have to play little other-

2017
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:11,600
You got my fucking husband into that game too, damn you.

2018
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:14,480
Hey, you know, you know it's a damn good game.

2019
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:15,480
Come on now.

2020
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:18,360
Someone's trying to bring it back, but good luck to them.

2021
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:21,000
But when I heard about Nino Cooney, I was like, yo, I am all up in this.

2022
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,280
I'm going to jump into this.

2023
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:23,760
I heard something about NFT.

2024
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:24,760
Nope.

2025
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:25,760
Nope.

2026
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:26,760
I'm out.

2027
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:27,760
Yeah.

2028
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:28,760
That's right.

2029
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:29,760
You know what?

2030
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:30,760
If you are one of those people that has spent thousands of dollars on Diablo Immortal and

2031
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:33,640
you're really mad at us for the earlier conversation, let me give you this.

2032
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:37,760
At least you haven't spent any time playing Nino Cooney.

2033
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:40,480
Well, I won't say it was me.

2034
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:42,480
So you can sleep okay tonight.

2035
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:45,680
I could definitely sleep okay, but I will say this.

2036
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:52,160
There are people who will just blindly spend that type of money on gotchas left and right.

2037
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:57,680
I have seen the worst end of that and it ain't pretty.

2038
02:04:57,680 --> 02:05:02,960
Questbuster in chat says Nino Cooney mobile is so bad that players are complaining of

2039
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:08,320
half an hour queue times because bots are hogging up all the spots to farm crypto in

2040
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,500
the game.

2041
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:14,180
There's even an in-game event slated in the future that requires you to link a crypto

2042
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:17,660
wallet and people aren't happy.

2043
02:05:17,660 --> 02:05:21,940
See that kind of reminds me of when people start playing WoW years ago and the whole

2044
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:23,460
gold farming and all of that.

2045
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:26,580
I'm just like, well, you know, hey.

2046
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:27,580
Anyway.

2047
02:05:27,580 --> 02:05:30,660
Oh, you want to talk about Shredder's Revenge?

2048
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:33,180
Can we can we have a nice palate cleanser, please?

2049
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:34,180
Absolutely.

2050
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:38,500
So what are we having VOD game night to play some play some Shredder's Revenge, man?

2051
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:40,980
I am absolutely loving this game.

2052
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:45,900
You can't see it, but I actually took out my fighting game joystick just to play this

2053
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:46,900
game.

2054
02:05:46,900 --> 02:05:53,180
I felt like twelve fucking years old in the laundromat playing as Donatello going through

2055
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:54,180
this game.

2056
02:05:54,180 --> 02:06:00,120
I I don't know about you, but I won't say the main thing.

2057
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:02,340
I won't play that game with you, Rama.

2058
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:03,340
Why?

2059
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:04,580
Because I also played Donatello.

2060
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:05,580
So fuck you.

2061
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:09,420
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

2062
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:10,420
You my boy.

2063
02:06:10,420 --> 02:06:12,780
I will gladly switch Leonardo for you.

2064
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:13,780
That was so good.

2065
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:14,780
I'm sorry.

2066
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:15,780
That was so good.

2067
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:16,780
Wasn't it?

2068
02:06:16,780 --> 02:06:21,060
So I fucking love you.

2069
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:23,460
Love all of y'all.

2070
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:25,340
I also am happy to play Leonardo.

2071
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:28,980
I actually had to step away for a second because there's a spider.

2072
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:30,980
I'll be right back.

2073
02:06:30,980 --> 02:06:32,140
This you'd be nice to it.

2074
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:33,540
Is the house going to burn down?

2075
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:34,540
Are you going to be OK?

2076
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:35,700
Good.

2077
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:39,860
Just escorted out of the house and thank you for its work and eating other bugs in your

2078
02:06:39,860 --> 02:06:40,860
house.

2079
02:06:40,860 --> 02:06:41,860
I don't know.

2080
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:42,860
But.

2081
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:43,860
But.

2082
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:44,860
If Loki's connection goes down.

2083
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:48,660
While Raphael is my favorite turtle, my favorite to play is Donatello.

2084
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:49,660
Yeah.

2085
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:53,980
It was because the staff had the range and like I didn't like playing Raphael because

2086
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:56,180
the side didn't have the range at all.

2087
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:59,300
But I imagine some people that would play him were really good as him.

2088
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:02,420
So it's just, you know, you you sacrifice distance for speed.

2089
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:03,420
Yeah.

2090
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:04,420
Speed, too.

2091
02:07:04,420 --> 02:07:05,420
So.

2092
02:07:05,420 --> 02:07:08,340
But there's always the badass one.

2093
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:15,540
There is one thing about the game and I that they did and I absolutely lost my shit over.

2094
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:16,780
It's the font.

2095
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:23,100
The main font in the game is the original font from the first from both arcade games.

2096
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:29,020
For me, that's like an ultimate Easter egg, because that's like to me personally, you

2097
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:34,740
know, it's a turtles game when it's that particular font for like where you're putting

2098
02:07:34,740 --> 02:07:38,940
in your name and the rankings and the credits and stuff like that.

2099
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:40,140
That had me.

2100
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:44,860
I'm sure if she wanted to, Dark Soccer could give us a whole seminar on how typography

2101
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:46,300
invokes emotion.

2102
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:47,620
And that's kind of the point.

2103
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:49,620
I see her smiling over there.

2104
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:55,660
That's why I didn't say anything, because I've said it enough that you know that I'm

2105
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:58,680
thinking the typography thoughts in my head.

2106
02:07:58,680 --> 02:07:59,680
Exactly.

2107
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:09,000
So yes, even art invokes emotion and even something as silly as a font will probably

2108
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,560
make you think of certain things.

2109
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:16,560
Like I don't want to I don't want to like talk us up too much, but you will notice the

2110
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:20,000
font that we use here at VOG Network on the site.

2111
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,160
It's a font you see a lot of places and sometimes you might see it and go, oh, that's like the

2112
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:25,160
VOG writing.

2113
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:26,560
But it's a font.

2114
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:27,560
It's a font.

2115
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:28,560
You can see it around.

2116
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:30,520
I can tell everyone what it is, if you want to know.

2117
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:33,080
Yeah, it's well, it's your your style.

2118
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:34,080
Yeah.

2119
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:39,560
So I thought that it looked very futuristic and honestly, it was easy to modify it into

2120
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:41,200
a power button and it looked really good.

2121
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:42,200
Yeah.

2122
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:46,720
Your modified version that's like the VOG logo is great, is totally what a logo should

2123
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:47,720
be.

2124
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:48,720
So, yeah.

2125
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:49,720
Yeah.

2126
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:50,720
Anyway.

2127
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:55,040
However, I will go on record and say that I like writing letters in Futura and leave

2128
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,600
it at that.

2129
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:59,680
Articius says, surprised y'all aren't using serpentine bold.

2130
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:06,440
I get that reference and I almost wanted to use it for the top font here, but it's just

2131
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:07,440
a little too.

2132
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:13,240
I didn't love the way it looked, which I actually since I did move everything over from the

2133
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:14,240
old computer.

2134
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:16,840
OK, so I'm on Futura bold.

2135
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:20,500
So since you brought it up.

2136
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:21,500
That's what it looks like.

2137
02:09:21,500 --> 02:09:26,940
I don't love it because it's a little too thick for me.

2138
02:09:26,940 --> 02:09:30,540
You're not going to hear me say that very often.

2139
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:34,420
He's got honestly enough, but it actually is.

2140
02:09:34,420 --> 02:09:37,460
It actually is pretty balanced, interesting.

2141
02:09:37,460 --> 02:09:41,780
It's a little like for but for for the top part, I think so.

2142
02:09:41,780 --> 02:09:45,880
But for the bottom half, like I feel like it kind of takes away from where the eyes

2143
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:47,460
ought to be here.

2144
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:48,460
Yeah.

2145
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:49,460
Yeah.

2146
02:09:49,460 --> 02:09:51,340
So that's that's my only issue with it.

2147
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:56,540
So anyway, it kind of reminds me of the font that we use for anime jam session, because

2148
02:09:56,540 --> 02:10:01,240
let's be real, everybody hates Comic Sans.

2149
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:03,300
So I stumbled across the comic new way.

2150
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:05,620
I'm like, oh, this is nice.

2151
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:09,880
I will tell you one thing about Comic Sans, though, that I learned is that it's easier

2152
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:13,060
for dyslexic people to read it.

2153
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:19,900
Interesting, but there's also much better dyslexic centered fonts now.

2154
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:25,340
Rama, I will take you up on that Turtles game night very soon.

2155
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:26,340
Stay tuned for details.

2156
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:31,660
As soon as they get everything settled here, which should be soon, we'll have a go at it.

2157
02:10:31,660 --> 02:10:34,260
Anything else on your mind tonight you want to talk to us about?

2158
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:38,860
They are brand new digivices out there that look like smartwatches called the Digivices.

2159
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:39,860
Yeah, I know.

2160
02:10:39,860 --> 02:10:40,860
Yeah.

2161
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:42,860
There's a couple of people on my Facebook that are kind of wanting them.

2162
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:43,860
So.

2163
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:44,860
Awesome.

2164
02:10:44,860 --> 02:10:45,860
All right, my friend.

2165
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:47,440
Well, I will let you go.

2166
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:50,320
Take care, anime jam session.

2167
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:51,480
Listen to it.

2168
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:52,900
Love it.

2169
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:54,600
I wish I would touch it.

2170
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:59,360
We had a big it wasn't anime, but we had a big convention here in SAC this weekend called

2171
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:03,480
Sinister Creature Con, which is like horror movies and FX.

2172
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:06,960
I would love to call into your show to talk about it because it's close enough that they

2173
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:07,960
got cosplay.

2174
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:09,760
They got all that same stuff, right?

2175
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:14,640
Actually, you know, that would be in our wheelbarrow because we did cover a couple of steampunk

2176
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:18,480
conventions years ago when it was popular.

2177
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:22,320
And one of my friends, she does a lot of those types of conventions anyway.

2178
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:23,840
One small problem.

2179
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:24,840
I didn't go.

2180
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:29,720
And the reason why is that I just had conflicts with timing this weekend.

2181
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:33,400
I hosted the after party that they did.

2182
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:37,200
We actually had Voltaire, big nerd musician that's done music.

2183
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:42,040
He's like a DragonCon staple and it's so because I'm like, I even said to him, I said, it's

2184
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:47,320
so nice to see you like outside DragonCon.

2185
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:52,280
I totally get that because in September I'm going to a convention called retro cons.

2186
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:57,240
It's all like 80s and 90s cartoons and toys and stuff.

2187
02:11:57,240 --> 02:12:02,480
And the main reason why I'm going is Venus Terzo is going to be a guest there.

2188
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:06,560
So you know, I have to get my Ron will have art book autographed by her.

2189
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,160
Oh, I love that.

2190
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:09,160
Excuse me.

2191
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:10,160
I love that.

2192
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:11,160
I love that.

2193
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:16,160
Right now, me and my friend, we're going to do Velma and Shaggy for the con or Luigi and

2194
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:17,160
Daisy.

2195
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:18,160
We just haven't figured it out yet.

2196
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:19,960
I will say really quick on the Voltaire thing.

2197
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:23,040
I wanted to take a quick step back because it actually wasn't DragonCon that introduced

2198
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:24,040
me to him.

2199
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:27,000
It was Deft that introduced me to him.

2200
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:31,380
And because he originally covered that when he was writing, like, I love the song articles

2201
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:33,920
for the early stages of VOG network site.

2202
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:38,720
And I remember because I actually really dug the song that he had picked and I did not

2203
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:39,720
realize.

2204
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:42,480
Apparently Voltaire is actually just generally pretty popular in Mexico because he told this

2205
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:49,280
whole story on stage about how his girlfriend heard the song of his at the Mexican DMV and

2206
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,840
like called him to say like your songs on.

2207
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:53,740
So he had this whole little monologue about it.

2208
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:58,000
He's a very good performer in the fact that he tells stories with his music.

2209
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
So it's good.

2210
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,680
And then he played the song in English and Spanish, which I thought was really cute.

2211
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:03,800
So yeah, that is really cool.

2212
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:04,800
Yeah.

2213
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:12,040
Let's do a cosplay crossover with Luigi, you know, from Luigi's Mansion and Shaggy.

2214
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:13,040
Okay.

2215
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:18,640
Before we get into that, Matt, I don't think you've seen it, but I have done Ghostbusters

2216
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:19,640
Luigi.

2217
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:24,320
It is called Boo Busters Luigi, proton pack jumpsuit.

2218
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:29,160
The pack here is a ghost from Super Mario Brothers and it glows in the dark.

2219
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:33,120
I will post photos on the OLR page for y'all to see it.

2220
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:34,120
I've seen it.

2221
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:35,120
I love them.

2222
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:36,120
All right.

2223
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:37,400
All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go.

2224
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:38,400
Take care.

2225
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:39,400
And thanks for the call tonight.

2226
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:40,400
No problem.

2227
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:41,400
Love you guys.

2228
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:42,400
Appreciate you all.

2229
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:43,400
See you on the flip side.

2230
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:44,400
Hugs and kisses.

2231
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,400
Bye.

2232
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:46,400
Cheesecake.

2233
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:47,400
Right.

2234
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:52,000
Good to hear from folks.

2235

Also in chat, this was posted like 30 minutes ago in chat, but I want to make sure I answer

2237
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:06,640
it because from our very own Bobby Black Wolf who said, so what are you looking forward

2238
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:11,600
to at SGDQ, which is coming up next week?

2239
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:13,240
I don't even know now.

2240
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:14,240
Next week.

2241
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:15,240
Next week.

2242
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:18,800
He's, I don't think it actually starts, starts until the same night as OLR.

2243
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:22,840
I don't remember if it starts that Sunday or if it actually doesn't start till Monday,

2244
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:27,420
but I'm looking forward to our very own Bobby Black Wolf doing more announcing, but this

2245
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:29,720
time live and in person.

2246
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:32,560
So that will be, he, I know he's doing.

2247
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:37,960
Yakuza like a dragon is the big one and I don't mean to say any speed run is bigger

2248
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:38,960
than others.

2249
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:43,620
However, Bobby is kind of an honorary part of the Yakuza speed run community at this

2250
02:14:43,620 --> 02:14:46,040
point, I think, cause he's hosted a lot of them.

2251
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:47,800
So that'll be a fun one to see.

2252
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:51,360
Although I guess I can only really watch the beginning because I still haven't beat the

2253
02:14:51,360 --> 02:14:52,360
game.

2254
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:56,240
And we know it will spoil the end, but I know he's hosting some other games as well.

2255
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:58,040
And so that'll be, that'll be fun.

2256
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:59,920
I don't know what, oh, go ahead.

2257
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:00,920
All right.

2258
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:04,960
Bobby says it starts Sunday at noon Eastern, um, respectfully, I have a lot of, of other

2259
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,560
things on my mind on Sunday.

2260
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:09,440
So if there's a run, I really have to see, at least they put everything on YouTube, but

2261
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:12,320
I'll watch later in the week for sure.

2262
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,920
I was going to say, I don't know what this is, but it sounds awesome.

2263
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:19,800
Mega Man extreme versus Mega Man extreme two, a hundred percent extreme mode.

2264
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:21,520
Oh, that's Game Boy color.

2265
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:22,520
Okay.

2266
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:26,880
Oh, looking forward to all the money that will be raised for a worthy cause.

2267
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:27,880
Yes.

2268
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:31,440
Is this the prevent cancer one or is this Doctors Without Borders?

2269
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:36,440
One of them is either one, you know, no, no, they're both worthy causes, but the winner

2270
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:38,720
one is always one charity and the summer one's always the other.

2271
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:39,720
Okay.

2272
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:40,720
Doctors Without Borders.

2273
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:44,760
Was it Final Fantasy six worlds collide randomizer.

2274
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:48,800
That sounds cool.

2275
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:50,200
I love the randomizers.

2276
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:51,200
I would love to watch that.

2277
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:53,680
I think the randomizer strategies are really interesting.

2278
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:57,040
So those, those, those are the things I look forward to.

2279
02:15:57,040 --> 02:16:02,840
And um, off awful games or silly games or whatever they call it, the, the, the silly

2280
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:03,840
game block.

2281
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:04,840
Yeah.

2282
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:05,840
Yeah.

2283
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:06,840
Yeah.

2284
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:11,840
I saw, um, there was a McDonald's game that looked pretty funny.

2285
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:16,880
Um, I don't know.

2286
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:18,680
Super Mario maker two relay races.

2287
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:19,680
Those are always good.

2288
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:21,240
Kaiser, super Metroid.

2289
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:22,640
I want to see that.

2290
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:23,680
Oh God.

2291
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:25,720
That's going to be wild.

2292
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:28,600
And super hot VR, but that'd be pretty exciting to watch.

2293
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:32,240
And then they're going to do of course, Elden ring to cap it all off.

2294
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:33,240
You know what?

2295
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:37,340
I think y'all just need to watch the whole thing except a Sunday.

2296
02:16:37,340 --> 02:16:40,760
You know, they're going to need Sunday to get warmed up.

2297
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:44,160
You know, it's the first one in person in a while, so let them get warmed up on Sunday

2298
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:48,200
and then Monday on YouTube and be in both.

2299
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:49,200
You could do both.

2300
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:52,960
You could, you could catch on how many channels I lurk in at one time.

2301
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:53,960
Yes.

2302
02:16:53,960 --> 02:17:00,280
Um, all the ones I watch.

2303
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:01,280
It's not my fault.

2304
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:03,280
I'm there first.

2305
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:04,280
All right.

2306
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:07,720
I think with that, it's about time to wrap up the show as so that dark soccer can do

2307
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:12,360
her own stream and, uh, the rest of us can enjoy the rest of our weekend or what have

2308
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:13,360
you.

2309
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:17,880
Um, we'll be back in seven days to do it all again with the 20th anniversary show.

2310
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:23,160
If you can believe we haven't been canceled after all these years, uh, before we do that,

2311
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:25,120
we're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

2312
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:28,840
Oh, I should say, of course, as I always do, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange

2313
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:32,340
Lawn Studio, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2314
02:17:32,340 --> 02:17:34,600
but we need more voices to put out here on air.

2315
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:37,040
So, um, tell a friend or two about the show.

2316
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:39,600
Tell somebody you don't like about the show because maybe they'll like it too.

2317
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:44,200
A nice five star review, however you found this show, a nice five star review on a site

2318
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:47,920
like iTunes, Spotify, wherever you found this, uh, would go a long way as well.

2319
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:51,300
Uh, hosts on Twitch, followers on Twitch for VOG Network.

2320
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:52,300
We'll take it all.

2321
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:54,260
Um, thank you again so much for being here.

2322
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:55,660
I appreciate you all.

2323
02:17:55,660 --> 02:17:58,180
Dark Sakura, your final thoughts tonight?

2324
02:17:58,180 --> 02:18:03,820
My final thought is that I follow this person called, uh, Eddie who, um, on Twitter who

2325
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:12,300
does Dead by Daylight doujinshi and they are putting up for doujinshi right now and I am

2326
02:18:12,300 --> 02:18:13,460
going to be able to get them.

2327
02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:14,460
I'm very happy.

2328
02:18:14,460 --> 02:18:15,460
Awesome.

2329
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:16,460
All right.

2330
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:17,820
Have a good post stream.

2331
02:18:17,820 --> 02:18:18,820
We'll see you next time.

2332
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:19,820
Later taters.

2333
02:18:19,820 --> 02:18:20,820
All right.

2334
02:18:21,020 --> 02:18:23,340
And uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2335
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:25,700
I can't believe it's going to be 20 years next week.

2336
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:26,700
I know.

2337
02:18:26,700 --> 02:18:27,700
Right?

2338
02:18:27,700 --> 02:18:28,940
Like literally where did the time go?

2339
02:18:28,940 --> 02:18:30,960
It's it's bonkers bananas.

2340
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:31,960
That's for sure.

2341
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:34,540
Uh, 20 years and no one still knows who we are.

2342
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:35,540
Yay.

2343
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:36,540
Yay.

2344
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:42,180
Uh, my final thought is, um, you know, I was expecting a lot more tech hiccups tonight

2345
02:18:42,180 --> 02:18:43,180
and it did.

2346
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:47,020
We definitely had a couple, but overall I'm very pleased with this investment in the new

2347
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:52,900
computer and just the fact that having the nice fresh restart to clear out all the old

2348
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:57,700
drivers and everything like it's just, it's nice and everything's running so smoothly.

2349
02:18:57,700 --> 02:19:01,280
I don't think we've missed hardly any frames tonight.

2350
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:05,780
It's been very lovely and uh, yeah, I'm looking forward to being encouraged to get back into

2351
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:06,900
streaming some more games.

2352
02:19:06,900 --> 02:19:08,500
I definitely have a backlog myself.

2353
02:19:08,500 --> 02:19:10,140
I do want to get into that.

2354
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:14,620
So thank you for bearing with me while I've been waiting to have a computer that's a little

2355
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:16,240
more capable of doing that.

2356
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:18,280
So I'm out of excuses now.

2357
02:19:18,280 --> 02:19:20,240
Um, that's it.

2358
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:23,840
We'll see you in seven days to do this all again.

2359
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:28,040
Um, it's a pretty big week and I hope, I hope some blasts in the past will show up.

2360
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:29,040
I hope you will show up.

2361
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:30,320
Thank you so much for being here.

2362
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:32,280
Um, have a great week everybody.

2363
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:33,280
Bye.

2364
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:38,160
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

2365
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:45,040
Orange lounge radio is a production of OLR studios to join us for our live show.
