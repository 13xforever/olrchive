0	14240	20 years ago, the news reported on a scary arcade game that featured booty booty booty
14240	18120	bass music. A few songs on which featured backgrounds with animations showing syringes
18120	23020	and pills, including a sexy nurse, but also the word medicine overlaid multiple times.
23020	27640	The news was negative. Geeks were outraged. 20 years later, most of the world has been
27640	34680	stuck with syringes multiple times, some also taking a pill in addition. The irony hurts.
34680	38600	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to continue reminiscing
38600	44160	and bring you gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
44160	54200	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back once again and again and
54200	60460	again to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio
60460	69360	live once again for tonight, June the 26th of 2022, episode number 920 of our show. And
69360	76500	as you might've heard the week that we have turned 20 years old as a show, a show that
76500	84980	dated back to our very first episode, June 23rd of 2002, when as Jason referenced there
84980	90500	in the intro, we were talking about controversy in the Dance Dance Revolution scene from,
90500	96140	oh my gosh, syringes and pills being shown in a background video. Who could imagine it?
96140	100460	And here we are 20 years later and syringes and pills, no big deal. That's commonplace
100460	106140	during the pandemic. By we, I mean, of course, myself, Rob Roberts joined as always by my
106180	110540	co-hosts. Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
110540	113180	Hey, what's up? I'm wearing the shirt.
113180	117780	Or as you've been known to say on the show for a very long time, what's up bitches?
117780	119420	What's up bitches?
119420	123740	You kind of made that, you kind of made that little motion tonight. What's up bitches?
123740	126020	With your OL army shirt, which I love.
126020	130300	I think I got this maybe after our third year.
130300	132180	Yeah, you've had it a while.
132940	139820	Kristen and I went to a trip to San Francisco and we had shirts made.
139820	140660	I love it.
140660	142900	I'll show you the back of it.
142900	147540	And on the back for those on the podcast feed, it says Dark Sakura with the number zero on the back.
147540	148020	Yep.
148020	152860	What number would I be on the team? If you're zero, which one am I?
152860	153900	0.69.
153900	158940	0.69, I'll take it. And then of course, of course, I have to ask the one and only
158940	160820	tech master, Loki.
160820	163220	Which number he would be. Hi, Loki.
163220	166500	I don't know.
166500	168740	Loki would be R.
168740	170940	The number R.
170940	172740	How about I would say 20.
172740	175380	Do you know why I would say 20?
175380	179420	Because that was the episode number when Dark Sakura and I were like, you know what?
179420	181020	Loki's been here every single week.
181020	184540	We're just retconning him as a full host for the whole thing.
184540	187900	So that was that was episode 20 because, you know, OK, so I'm going to go back.
187900	194220	Let's go back to the back down memory lane, because we're going to be doing that a little bit tonight as we look back on 20 years of the show.
194220	211420	Is that way back on the very first episode of OLR, which, by the way, for those of you that listen here at VOG Network, because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, Twitch.TV slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
211420	215020	Bobby wasn't on tonight, but I'll come back to that in a minute.
215020	227940	But anyway, we said a long time ago on this show, originally it was just Dark Sakura and I were going to start this show because we were on another show that was on for a long time, over 10 years, called Undersedation Live.
228380	230540	Dark Sakura was a guest host, but it was kind of like Loki.
230540	231700	She was there like all the time.
232060	232540	So.
233620	235540	Going in for for Jessica.
235540	236300	Yeah, a lot.
236340	236740	Yeah.
236740	237220	Yeah.
237380	237700	Yeah.
237700	241260	So so anyway, it was originally Dark Sakura and I.
241260	254700	But then the original vision of Orange Lounge Radio, and I've said this a lot, a lot, is that we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at the arcade, and then we would go from the arcade to the little cafe that was in front of Rose Hill Golf Land.
254820	263700	And we would eat mozzarella sticks to just put back those calories we just lost playing DDR and talk a little smack about video games, but in a fun way, because we love video games.
264420	271340	And the original episodes of OLR, we're trying to kind of like invoke that same thing where we would have everybody over at the house.
271340	273780	We invited like a lot of DDR people over it.
273780	291380	Like if you go back and listen to the first episode of Orange Lounge Radio, which you can do at VOG Network, because last year for the 19th anniversary, we did a special show where we all listened and reacted to episode one, which is which and I think we all kind of walked away going, that wasn't as bad as we thought it would be.
292780	293380	So that was fun.
293380	296020	So that is in the archives over at VOG Network for subscribers.
297140	299020	So what were you gonna say, Jayden?
299900	302940	I said, no, it was a it was pretty decent, actually.
302940	307180	It wasn't as bad as cringe as I expected it to be.
307300	307940	It wasn't.
307940	308700	It really wasn't.
309860	313900	And first off, because, you know, we do like to say we're the show where every gamer has a voice.
314140	316300	I know the situation with the pandemic.
316700	318340	We're doing this virtually now.
318700	322180	And it's just kind of now we've been used to doing it this way for so long.
322420	324900	We kind of don't really get together in the same room anymore.
325140	331540	But I'm so thankful that all of you in chat are here to share these weeks with us, whether you're
331540	335300	here every single week, like Dark Tetsuya, I'm just going to I'm going to name names.
335740	340820	Dark Tetsuya has been here pretty much every single week since the very first episode.
340900	343460	He may have missed an episode here or there, but so is Dark Sakura.
343460	344100	So is Loki.
344380	345340	So so have I.
345860	347700	There was there were a couple of shows I wasn't even at.
347700	349780	So like, you know, we all missed a show here and there.
349820	351980	Dark Tetsuya has been there since the very beginning as well.
352180	352980	In our chat room.
352980	358700	So whether you're Dark Tetsuya or anybody else, if you're just I'm seeing so many names I haven't seen
358700	361140	in years tonight in chat.
361140	365100	So I just I really want to say thank you and show the love back.
365100	369780	And also I am just blown away.
369780	371540	I don't even know the word vocabulary.
371540	372820	I failed tonight.
373020	378020	One of my co-hosts has to help me is that you all are so generous.
378020	383260	Like we had a hype train level five before the show even went live.
384220	385620	And that's huge.
385780	388980	And I will I will read all your names and acknowledge you after the show.
388980	393660	For those that haven't been here in a while, because we're doing this on Twitch TV, we don't you really do it
393660	396340	like other Twitch channels because we're recording our podcast.
396540	401740	So we don't like to do that awkward stop every time someone donates and say, hey, Dark Sakura, thanks for the sub.
401900	402940	But we will acknowledge.
402940	404660	Please, please know we see you.
405460	407780	It's I'm looking at some of these bitty totals.
407820	411700	This is astounding. People are donating like a thousand bits, twenty seven hundred bits at a time.
412540	420580	The hype train, twenty four gifts and sorry, twenty four subs and six thousand four hundred and thirty bits.
420580	424900	That's screenshotted at four hundred and four percent huge.
425100	428820	I'm just like I I'm not going to cry tonight because I said I'm not going to fucking do it.
429380	434300	Do it. But your your generosity is amazing.
434300	437740	And thank you. You really have been the motivation to be here.
438140	444660	Throughout the shitty pandemic and everything else going on in the world, which I do need to call this out.
444740	446220	We are a video game podcast.
446220	450860	We talk about gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, but and we're celebrating tonight.
450860	452260	This is a huge celebration.
452340	461380	No other live Internet show that's weekly that we know of has gotten to 20 years, at least in the video game world.
461380	462660	Maybe some tech shows out there.
462660	464020	I just I can't follow everything.
464180	468100	But in the video game world, there's no like weekly Internet show that's gotten to 20 years.
468980	470740	So this is this is really historic.
470740	475580	And I'm saying that with all humility and humbleness that this is it's because of you guys.
475580	477540	And it's really that drive there.
478620	479740	And we're celebrating tonight.
479740	484540	But we is a night to do some horn tooting.
484700	486020	Yeah. Yeah, I know it is.
486020	487860	It is. But I'm going to be honest.
487860	489980	And you all know, I don't shy away from these topics.
490300	493500	We have a platform, even though it is a small platform.
493500	501980	And I need to use this platform to say what happened in this country on Friday from the Supreme Court is fucking bullshit.
501980	505380	And you can bold that, underline it, italicize it.
505780	510260	And although, yes, we're celebrating tonight and that's a huge part of what's in our hearts.
510860	513900	There's also a big part of our hearts that is very sad.
514220	520580	I am I am so sad for the women and people with uteruses in this country that are affected by this decision.
520580	530500	And you know what? We're all affected by this decision because we all have a wife or a sister or a niece or a cousin or a daughter or a mother, et cetera, et cetera.
530500	533540	We all have someone that is affected by this.
533540	536540	And I'm going to say this very bluntly.
537500	541300	If you haven't had an abortion, you know someone who has.
543340	546740	And this affects everything.
546740	548620	And yes, I am well aware.
548660	554660	Thank you for the five thousand messages directed at me that said they're coming for you next.
554900	559420	I'm well aware they're coming for all of us.
559620	561780	Clarence Thomas said it himself already.
562540	569260	Of course, you want to know who is also responsible for getting Clarence Thomas instated as a justice?
570180	571060	Our president.
571180	573140	Yeah, believe Anita Hill.
574140	574500	Yeah.
575660	588540	Anyway, I do want to try to keep the mood celebratory on our show, but it would be irresponsible of us to not say something about that situation and acknowledge that it's some bullshit.
588860	591620	There are a lot of funds out there that you can donate to.
591860	595620	The number one thing you can do is make noise and talk to people.
596220	604020	You have to remember there's another side of this argument that uses the imagery of dead babies to try to control people.
604020	605220	And that's what it is.
605220	606580	This is about control.
606820	622220	And when people don't even know science, when people say dead babies, that's what they're trying to do is use that horrific imagery to control you and ask anyone who understands what this argument is really about.
622660	624180	It is not about dead babies.
624660	626300	And I'm just going to leave it at that.
626340	631620	Like when you when you say that, you just tell me that you're only listening to shock imagery.
631940	632300	I'm sorry.
633300	638580	As the person on this podcast who owns a uterus, I would like to make a comment, please.
640380	642180	I'm going to go into a little bit of science on here.
642900	646980	Number one, there is not a heartbeat when people are saying their heartbeat.
646980	648100	It's electrical pulses.
648100	650460	There's no heart formed to beat.
651260	663620	Number two, an abortion provided during the first trimester typically is when the fetus is not large enough to require being physically pulled out of the body like they like they claim happen.
664060	666660	Most abortions happen during the first trimester.
666860	673740	One is given a pill, one passes the fetus and it hurts and it's terrible.
674420	678860	It is a pain that has it's pretty much on par.
679460	689500	Well, maybe not as bad as actual childbirth, but on par with the same pressures the body goes through, not to mention the hormonal imbalances after the fact.
690580	701620	And then on top of that, you know, say that you're somebody who is who's wanted this child, has carried it, and then you find out that the pregnancy isn't viable, that it could kill you.
702540	704220	And you have to make that decision.
704620	733180	People who have to make that, they're basically condemning many people to death over their religious opinion, which, first of all, bless the satanic temple, I'm sorry, the satanic temple for doing the right work, for going in guns blazing and calling out the religious violation.
733540	738500	And personal violations that this is doing, I love them to bits, I support them in what they do.
738500	741340	And you say this as a proud Jewish person.
741980	743860	I'm also a card carrying Satanist.
744100	744980	Yeah, no, I get it.
744980	745380	I get it.
745380	745740	Yeah.
747740	750820	Well, on top of that, they were actually formed by a Jewish person, just FYI.
751220	764980	Anyway, I want to say that every last one of you owes it to yourself to number one, educate yourself on what actually happens in an abortion.
766100	777900	Number two, also educate yourself on what happens during childbirth and what a uterus possessing person goes through.
778660	798700	On top of that, it's going to make it even harder for lower income women to, I'm going to say women generically in this sense, you know, to go seek out health care for things like endometriosis, which is already a bitch to get diagnosed.
799100	809660	I've had several friends not get their endo, what's the word I'm thinking of, diagnosis until they, you know, like eight, 10 years later.
809660	814220	And by that time they can't get pregnant because of the damage done to their bodies.
815100	819660	It's going to make it harder for people who wish to get sterilized to be sterilized.
820300	825580	I was lucky enough that I basically stood my ground when they tried to talk me out of it.
825580	827420	I'm like, it's my body.
827420	828860	I want the shit out.
828860	830140	And we live in California.
830940	831440	Yes.
832540	842380	It's this value that's only placed on women that your value is as an incubator.
843340	846540	And then we're going to go ahead and actually look at the other half of this.
847820	850700	What are they going to do when the child is born?
851660	854300	They're not going to want to support education.
854300	858780	They're not going to want to support the social programs that will help the majority
858780	861580	of low-income families support said children.
862300	865020	They're not going to want to provide them a college education.
865020	870540	And I'll tell you a big thing about that is, and this is why, I mean, if you look back in history,
870540	878700	why in some cases it was illegal for the, the quote lower class to seek an education,
878700	883660	because an educated population will make an educated decision.
884460	886460	Especially when it comes time to vote.
888060	892380	I think this is how they hold onto their power.
893180	895660	And we have to take that power back.
896540	899740	We need to get away from Republican and Democrat.
901020	902940	It's time to do something different.
902940	908060	The definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
909020	913660	And right now, and I say this with all the respect to our allies,
915180	924540	but if you do not have a uterus and you are trying to claim some of this stuff as fact,
924540	931980	when you are incorrect, when your religion has no place in science or government, I don't care.
931980	932780	Shut the fuck up.
933180	936620	Go educate yourself and then come back with an opinion.
936620	938460	And then maybe we'll have a discussion.
940460	944940	And just, just to, to, on a note to end on with this, is that like,
944940	949900	I think the thing that pees me the most about this is that the people that are trying to shut
949900	955660	this down and you know it, you watch enough news, you see the people trying to shut this down and
956460	964780	you know it either have had or have been the reason for, in most cases, an abortion.
964780	965980	You know it.
967260	968620	You know that to be true.
968620	973660	And it's, it's this hypocrisy that is the most dangerous and deadly thing that
973660	975260	continues to go on in this country.
976620	978140	So look at that.
978140	978620	Oh, go ahead.
979180	981100	I'm even going to go beyond that.
981180	988300	And I'm going to say it's not just, we have the people in power providing their line,
988300	990460	even whether or not they actually believe it.
990460	992300	I'm going to, I'm going to throw that out there.
992300	998620	That is the hypocrisy behind it is that any of these rich politicians or anyone in the higher
998620	1003820	brackets of income will still be able to go somewhere and get an abortion.
1003820	1007340	It's going to affect anyone, middle-class and lower income.
1008300	1018540	But the other half of this equation is the willful ignorance of the general population,
1018540	1022140	the people who believe them with this cult-like mentality.
1022140	1029980	And the moment that you try to introduce an idea that is contrary, and I'm actually thinking
1029980	1036060	of my mother when I say this, that is contrary to their internalized belief system.
1037820	1043340	They react like, like they're having some sort of mental breakdown.
1043340	1047020	That's the only way I can describe it that they become angry.
1047020	1048060	They become violent.
1048060	1054060	It's almost like, like this grieving, like they're starting to go into the denial part
1054060	1058220	of the, of the grieving process because a part of their belief is being attacked and
1058220	1059580	might die, you know?
1059580	1073260	And it has to be that we need to find a way to introduce education in so undeniable and
1073260	1079580	digestible of a way that they have no choice but to learn the truth.
1081740	1087820	And that's, we have a handful of people with archaic ideas that don't reflect the majority
1087820	1092540	of people in this country creating the decisions for the people in this country.
1094540	1100460	Anyway, we've just spent multiple minutes at the top of what is supposed to be our biggest
1100460	1103580	episode ever talking about this issue.
1103580	1106940	And I think this should show how serious it is, I would think.
1106940	1112140	So with that, we will put the soapbox back behind the curtain for the moment.
1113660	1116700	Anyhow, I do want to, of course, say hello to those of you that are in our chat room
1116780	1122620	over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where you're getting, or, you know, we're getting
1122620	1128700	a lot of cheers and support in chat for the soapbox that we are currently standing on.
1129340	1131500	But I do want to point out some of the other comments in chat.
1132300	1136540	Let's see, Pod Culture talking about the celebration and all that earlier says,
1137180	1141820	you will have to do it in person next year since the show will be old enough to drink.
1141820	1145260	You know, we would have loved to have done an in-person show this year.
1145260	1152140	I think the, just the, still the big question mark around the pandemic and everything has
1152140	1154140	made it difficult to plan.
1154140	1158060	I think it would have been very frustrating if we had tried to plan an in-person something
1158060	1159980	and then here comes an outbreak.
1159980	1164700	I mean, just earlier today I was playing, is it allergies or is it COVID?
1164700	1166620	Because I'm feeling a little bit eh.
1166620	1172060	Now I took a test and it appears the answer is it's allergies, but you just can't be
1172060	1172940	too sure right now.
1172940	1177180	It's a little wild.
1177900	1178940	Like you're playing the game.
1178940	1180140	What's the sniffle?
1180140	1181900	Yeah, exactly.
1181900	1184060	It's like, what was the game show?
1184060	1185900	Let's see what's behind door number one.
1185900	1186300	Exactly.
1186300	1187340	Is it COVID?
1187340	1189820	Door number two is the sinus infection.
1189820	1192620	Door number three, meningitis outbreak in Florida.
1192620	1195260	Like just the hilarity goes on these days.
1195260	1196460	Is it monkey pox?
1196460	1197740	That one was floating too.
1197740	1198700	I know, I know.
1198700	1200460	And then let's see, look at your treatment.
1200460	1204220	You choose box number two, nothing.
1204220	1206700	You get absolutely nothing.
1206700	1211340	You so stupid to quote UHF on Wheel of Fish.
1213260	1213740	Let's see.
1213740	1222620	Going back to our chat, let's see other comments that had or said, Rama said, OLR next year
1222620	1223900	can officially drink.
1223900	1224620	Yes.
1224620	1230460	Tyre Con chat says, OLR has been around long before podcasts existed.
1231420	1233100	Yeah, in a way, yeah.
1233100	1235980	And again, I don't know.
1235980	1242620	Long is a relative term, but podcasting, I know the first OLR to go edition was in like
1242620	1245420	December of 2004, January 2005.
1245420	1246460	It was early.
1246460	1247500	It was very early.
1248540	1252620	And I want to say podcasting kind of started probably around 2004.
1252620	1256300	It probably started the year before we jumped on with our to go edition.
1256300	1260620	Because the history is, yes, we were a live show on live 365.
1260620	1263340	Then as soon as podcasting was a thing, we jumped on that.
1263340	1268540	And then we kind of like merged the two shows together because when we were talking mostly
1268540	1273820	about music games on the live show, the music game scene kind of went through a drought.
1273820	1277580	And then we merged the shows and like not even six months later, Guitar Hero came out
1277580	1280620	and started a big resurgence of music games, but it's fine.
1280620	1281660	At my house.
1281660	1285260	Yeah, I love where the show has gone since then.
1285260	1286300	So there is that.
1286300	1287020	Oh, I love this.
1288220	1289420	Fanara in chat.
1289420	1289980	I love this.
1290620	1294300	Says OLR lasted five times longer than the Confederacy.
1295740	1296940	Yes, it has.
1296940	1297820	Yes, it has.
1299580	1300300	Amen to that.
1301180	1302300	Loki, I didn't even tie.
1302300	1306540	And so speaking of things from OLR's history, I usually ask what's playing behind you on
1306540	1307100	Twitch.
1307100	1308860	What is playing behind you on Twitch tonight?
1309580	1314060	It is a video they posted on the Orange Lounge Radio channel.
1315100	1320140	I don't know how long ago, 15 years ago, it was probably the last time our YouTube was
1320140	1320780	actually updated.
1320780	1323900	It's it's it's the historical press.
1323900	1329020	It's the historical preservation of the Grand Theft Auto modded death match games I used
1329020	1329500	to play.
1330540	1335980	Oh, God, years ago, you know, some of the best gaming moments ever.
1336700	1337340	It's a good video.
1337980	1342140	Unfortunately, unfortunately, they had patched that stuff out long ago.
1342140	1349100	But, you know, being experienced or being exposed to that for so long, maybe an even
1349100	1352540	better Grand Theft Auto player, because it's like, OK, well, you know, here we've been
1352540	1355980	playing with like nukes and just like rapid fire grenade launchers and stuff.
1356620	1358940	Now we have to contend with a shotgun.
1358940	1360300	I think I can handle that.
1360300	1363740	And so but it was a lot of fun.
1363740	1367900	If you want to see some OLR blasts from the past, like when we were on the news a couple
1367900	1375020	times, when we have some random ass E3 videos, Loki's video he's talking about now, Loki
1375020	1376780	drunk playing Mario Kart.
1376780	1379660	If you want to see all that, like check out the OLR YouTube channel.
1379660	1380940	It's just Orange Lounge Radio on YouTube.
1380940	1382700	You can see a lot of crazy shit there.
1382700	1383100	It's it's pretty rough.
1383100	1385020	I'm pulling something out of this bag.
1385020	1385260	All right.
1385260	1386460	Can I get a comment from chat?
1387660	1389420	Oh, that's when we were in the paper.
1389420	1390620	That is the old.
1390620	1392140	Is that the old place Loki and I lived at?
1392140	1392780	Yeah, it is.
1392780	1393340	Yes, it is.
1393340	1394380	So wild.
1394380	1395180	That is so wild.
1395180	1395500	Yep.
1395500	1397020	That's nice standing up there.
1397740	1400300	I didn't laminate mine, so mine kind of fell apart.
1400300	1402620	And this isn't really laminated.
1402620	1404460	It did yellow out a little bit.
1404460	1410140	I just had this like binder thing that I kept it in forever and it never.
1412300	1412860	Look at that.
1412860	1413500	I think that's.
1414460	1415660	Oh, that's is that Travis?
1416700	1418060	No, that's somebody else.
1418060	1418780	I think it's somebody else.
1418780	1421740	Yeah, that's some dude that there's a guy.
1421740	1424940	Like, was it about bicycling or something like that?
1424940	1430060	So the caption on here, Orange Lounge Radio Dance Dance Revolution is a video game in
1430060	1432860	which players dance on the touch pad to the beat of the music.
1432860	1440860	Orange Lounge Radio podcast dance music and commentary by podcast creators Matt, Rob and
1440860	1441100	me.
1441660	1442380	Oh, my gosh.
1442380	1445100	It had my unmarried name.
1445740	1446220	Oh, wow.
1448220	1451180	I had to literally stop and think about what that name is.
1451180	1451740	But anyway.
1452860	1456460	Well, you remember I used to get Jessica's former fiance's mail.
1456460	1456940	No, I know.
1456940	1457260	I know.
1458140	1461500	I want to get this comment from chat because I think this is from a blast from the past
1461500	1464060	listener KevBZ3 in our chat.
1464060	1467900	If I'm not mistaking, that is the artist formerly known as DDR Kevin.
1467900	1473020	So hello and great to see you tonight in chat says it's pretty interesting how the whole
1473020	1480060	live to podcast to live trend kind of played out over the last 20 years with the advancement
1480060	1482300	of various platforms over the time span.
1483260	1486460	This is so true, Bestie, as the kids would say today.
1487260	1493100	It is fascinating how that live to podcast to live because you may or may not recall
1493100	1495020	there was a year or two.
1495020	1496860	It was around the time Final Fantasy 13 was new.
1496860	1501900	It was probably 2006, 2007 when we were broadcasting this show on Justin TV.
1502460	1503980	And it wasn't really a blip.
1504620	1509500	And Bobby had his Friday night gaming show, and he was being told who wants to watch other
1509500	1511900	people play video games while you do a podcast.
1511900	1514940	And it isn't that fascinating that now it's the norm.
1514940	1519980	I'm not trying to like toot our own horn about being like ahead of the curve or whatever,
1519980	1524060	maybe a little bit, but it does go to show you that generally because I bet we weren't
1524060	1526700	the only only people in the entire universe either.
1526700	1529740	You know, many people mentioned they found us through all games, and there were a lot
1529740	1532940	of people on that network back in the day who are doing very similar things.
1532940	1537500	So this was a path we forged as indie creators.
1537500	1543980	So the indie folks really were the trendsetters here, and it wasn't until IGN or whatever
1543980	1546380	started doing it that it got really cool, I guess.
1546380	1548140	So there's that.
1549180	1550620	But yeah, it's wild.
1550620	1553500	I have other questions that we get asked a lot.
1553500	1557020	I'm going to get to in a moment, but I have a couple other things I need to get to first.
1557020	1558620	I have a lot of announcements and things tonight.
1558620	1563980	OK, so number one, I mentioned that Bobby Black Wolf was not here tonight.
1563980	1567020	However, Bobby has sent us a special message.
1567100	1570860	I'm going to apologize to my co-host because the way this show is wired, you're not going
1570860	1574300	to be able to hear this as the audience does, but I'll recap here at the end.
1574300	1575020	So I apologize.
1575020	1579420	So let's go to a special pre-taped message from our pal Bobby Black Wolf.
1579420	1580540	Hello, OLR.
1580540	1582060	It's Bobby Black Wolf.
1582060	1585740	Sorry I couldn't be there live tonight on your 20th anniversary.
1585740	1586780	I really wanted to be there.
1586780	1592940	I really wanted to be in Sacramento, but instead I'm in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bloomington,
1592940	1596220	actually, for Summer Games Done Quick 2022.
1596220	1600300	I am hosting Summer Games Done Quick this year.
1600300	1604860	I'm going to be hosting early Monday morning as well as Tuesday afternoon.
1604860	1607580	Check gamesdonequick.com for the schedule for that.
1607580	1610940	But I wanted to make something and even show you a little bit of what Games Done Quick
1610940	1615580	looks like when you're not looking at it from their official Twitch stream.
1615580	1616860	That's what I'm running here.
1616860	1620700	I'm going to be taking more videos during the week, and I should be back next week so
1620700	1622380	I can delay OLR's start.
1622380	1623660	But happy birthday, OLR.
1623660	1625100	I did not delay your start tonight.
1625100	1628860	You were able to start on time for your 20th anniversary.
1628860	1631100	Thank you so much for being a friend to me.
1631660	1637900	And y'all are the reason that I'm still doing this and probably why I'm here at SGDQ.
1637900	1643420	It's because I continued doing the podcast with y'all and being your lead-in, being
1643420	1647420	your opening band for the past 15, 16 years.
1647420	1650060	And hopefully we'll be doing it for much longer.
1650060	1651180	So thank you, OLR.
1651180	1654620	Congratulations on 20 years on the air.
1655420	1656780	Well, thank you so much for that, Bobby.
1656780	1657580	Appreciate it.
1657580	1660780	And you know we don't consider you an opening act.
1660780	1663020	We consider you a co-headliner.
1663020	1666460	So congratulations on going back to Summer Games Done Quick.
1666460	1669260	I know you guys couldn't hear the audio, but you could probably see the video.
1669260	1672700	And obviously he's showing a little bit of what Summer Games looks like when it's not
1672700	1674940	on Twitch, like what it actually looks like there in person.
1674940	1679100	And boy, you can see the precautions they're taking this year.
1679100	1680860	Like everything is spaced out.
1681100	1684060	That arcade, that was wild.
1684060	1686860	But I mean, I'm glad they're taking it seriously.
1686860	1691180	And I'm glad they're allowing people that are even, because my understanding is there's
1691180	1695500	quite a few immunocompromised people that are either involved with Games Done Quick
1695500	1698860	or are speedrunners or a variety of those things.
1698860	1703500	So it's really great that while there's a lot of people that are just like, eh, COVID's
1703500	1707020	done with, it's really great that they are still like going above and beyond and taking
1707020	1707820	those precautions.
1707900	1711100	And it's how nice to have something like that back.
1711100	1716140	So Bobby will definitely be watching, not just when you are doing donations, but I'm
1716140	1717980	sure throughout the week as well.
1717980	1719420	That'll be really cool.
1719420	1722060	So thank you for that message.
1722060	1722940	Really appreciate that.
1723580	1726940	OK, I have another kind of special-ish announcement.
1727660	1734940	And the interesting thing about this is that it is actually nothing that myself, Dark Sakura,
1734940	1735820	or Loki did.
1736060	1741500	So it's a special little treat for Orange Lounge Radio's 20th anniversary.
1741500	1745020	And this is something that Dark Tetsuya actually put together.
1745020	1746860	I think he had a lot of help with this.
1746860	1752140	I don't know all of the people that helped with this, but it is a new website.
1752140	1757820	And if you want to get to this website, it's bit.ly.
1758780	1769180	So that traditional URL shortener, bit.ly slash o-l-r-cive and the number two, because
1769180	1774380	o-l-r-cive one was gone, the skydrive or whatever folded.
1774380	1782380	So o-l-r-cive two is a new archive of Blast from the Past of the show.
1782380	1785900	If you want to go back and listen to episode one, you can do that.
1785900	1786540	It's here for you.
1786780	1788140	In fact, he actually even broke it up into seasons.
1788140	1793260	I believe this is just about every single live episode of the show we ever did is here.
1794460	1797260	And I'll come back to this in a minute because there's another exciting thing here too.
1797260	1802700	And then even some of the specials, I didn't even remember we did a Christmas special in
1802700	1803580	2007.
1804140	1808140	There was the roast to Travis and whatever.
1808140	1813980	The best April Fool's joke we ever did, the giggling lesbian gaming show is here.
1813980	1815020	You can get all of it.
1815100	1816460	It's all on the o-l-r-cive.
1817260	1821180	I am going to give the usual disclaimer that I give when it comes to Orange Launch Radio
1821180	1821660	old shit.
1822380	1830220	This is a 20 year old show and the humor and the jokes and the catch phrases that we may
1830220	1835580	have said back in 2002 would not necessarily be things we would say today.
1835580	1839580	I hope you all know that, but you and I both know that there are haters out there in the
1839580	1843660	world that would love nothing more than to crawl through these archives and look for
1843660	1850220	something where maybe I repeated hot T word mess because I heard it on an episode of Project
1850220	1851660	Runway and thought it was funny.
1851660	1856220	And I didn't realize until a few years ago, it actually isn't funny to a large group of
1856220	1856700	people.
1856700	1858780	So I stopped saying that.
1858780	1862620	So I just want to kind of put that out there as the general disclaimer when it comes to
1862620	1863100	old shit.
1863740	1866380	Please treat it like it is old shit.
1867020	1871500	But thank you very much to Dark Tits, I almost said Dark Soccer.
1871500	1873420	Well, thank you to Dark Soccer for being a part of those shows.
1873820	1876620	Thank you to Dark Tits for putting that all together.
1876620	1879500	Now, here's the part where it gets wild.
1880620	1886540	Not only to Dark Tits put together that whole archive of shows, but last year we went back
1886540	1889500	and listened to episode one of Orange Launch Radio.
1889500	1894300	And there was kind of a joke that was being said that, oh, maybe next year you should
1894300	1896300	go back and listen to episode two.
1896940	1902700	And the answer was we can't because the recording of episode two was so fucked up.
1902700	1904780	It has popping all over the place.
1904780	1909580	It has just all this, like the MP3 is broken and it is unlistenable.
1909580	1910300	Well, guess what?
1910940	1916700	If you go to the new oil archive, which I hope somebody's put that URL in chat by now,
1917340	1924140	you're going to notice in season one, this episode two is the 2022 remastered version.
1925100	1933420	Dark Tits Suya went through that entire episode, three hour episode, cut out every single pop
1934060	1937820	and adjusted the pitch to make it coherent.
1938700	1945260	It is a little rough on the ears still because it's a little garbled, but you can still
1945260	1946940	at least understand what we're saying.
1947660	1953820	And I am just impressed at the fact that that is that is like, do you remember in
1954460	1960380	returns the best Batman movie when the penguin went through all the shredded documents that
1960380	1964940	that Shrek did and he held them up and he said a whole lot of patience will get you
1964940	1965660	a long way.
1965660	1969660	And he like had the whole things all stitched back together that had been through the shredder.
1969660	1976060	It's very that so kudos to Dark Tits Suya, our very own penguin here at Orange Lounge
1976060	1979500	Radio for putting that whole thing back together.
1979500	1981980	That is more than impressive.
1981980	1984380	And I want to say thank you for that.
1984380	1988220	And Dark Tits Suya says you have no idea how long that took me.
1988220	1991820	I can guess that is that is wild, wild, wild.
1991820	1995420	And G.G. Rama is going, bro, I would have helped you on that.
1995420	1996220	Good shit, man.
1996220	1996720	Good shit.
1997660	2005340	So, yeah, but that is that is a little gift from the community to us and the community.
2005340	2009660	And honestly, Dark Soccer, Loki and I can really sit here and say we had nothing to
2009660	2010160	do with that.
2010800	2012720	They did nothing.
2012720	2013920	It's a secret to everyone.
2013920	2017280	Yeah, it was a secret to everyone, no, I mean, he clued us in about a month ago.
2017280	2021840	He was working on it, but I didn't know he well, because you don't really all our forms,
2021840	2022340	but that's all right.
2024720	2025920	Yeah, I know you have the forms.
2026640	2029200	No, that we have that secret of our form, but it doesn't matter.
2029200	2031680	So, you know, I actually I couldn't get into it.
2031680	2033120	I know you were having problems.
2033120	2033520	It's fine.
2033520	2034480	It's whatever.
2034480	2035920	But oh, whoops.
2035920	2037440	Now I just let out a big secret.
2037440	2039680	Now people in shadow like the forums are still active.
2039680	2041120	No, no, they're gone.
2041840	2043040	There's nothing for you to see there.
2044880	2047440	We have a 20 year confession time.
2047440	2048880	We have a hidden forum.
2048880	2052640	That's why they're still up at all, where we still collaborate on what's going to be
2052640	2053840	on the show every week.
2053840	2057920	So it's so we can like story dump our stories and all that good stuff.
2057920	2060640	So that's the only email Rob that shit.
2062720	2063220	All right.
2064480	2069360	So moving on into our kickoff topic tonight, which usually we would tackle a topic in
2069360	2070800	the gaming industry.
2070800	2074560	But tonight I thought, eh, you know what the big headline is tonight?
2075200	2076640	We're turning 20.
2076640	2078480	So let's make the kickoff topic about us.
2079440	2082960	So we'll talk about Gamescom or some of this other stuff later.
2082960	2084240	Let's talk about us a little bit.
2085200	2088320	And I would like to go through and talk a little bit as we reflect.
2088320	2091760	We like to raise a toast to me.
2093760	2094240	I love that.
2094240	2094880	Yes, I'd like to.
2095760	2097440	What is the thing you and Dan always say?
2097440	2101760	I'd like to raise a toast to ourselves and who's like us, damn few.
2101760	2104080	Oh, no, that's not us that came up with that.
2104080	2107440	Oh, I thought it's like who's like us, damn few.
2107440	2108160	And they're all dead.
2108880	2109600	Okay, that's it.
2110640	2110960	All right.
2111520	2118880	So I thought maybe to go back on 20 years of OLR, I have assembled a list of questions
2118880	2125280	tonight that are the most common questions we get having a 20 year old podcast.
2125280	2127760	And I thought we could go through and answer them.
2127760	2129360	So y'all ready for some Q&A?
2129360	2130080	Y'all ready?
2130080	2130580	All right.
2131200	2137680	So the first question I'd like to go over tonight is what's the secret to keeping a
2137680	2141360	show or podcast going for 20 years?
2142080	2144720	So what's the secret to keeping this shit up for 20 years?
2145280	2148240	Routine and unwilling to change your routine, I guess.
2149440	2150400	Can you elaborate on that?
2150400	2152560	Like, what do you mean by like unwilling to change routine?
2152960	2155280	Because like, this is what I do every Sunday.
2155840	2160160	So I don't know what I guess I'd play more Minecraft if it wasn't doing this.
2161680	2165760	But yeah, before that, you know, it this is just what I do every Sunday.
2165760	2168320	So it's, you know, it's routine at this point.
2170400	2171040	Dark Sakura?
2171040	2171760	Make it a routine.
2172400	2173200	I have no idea.
2174320	2176960	I can speak to a diet like this.
2176960	2177760	Being stubborn?
2178560	2182560	I think actually, as much as you may say that tongue in cheek, I think there's definitely
2182560	2183600	some truth in this to that.
2183600	2184880	I think stubbornness.
2184880	2192000	There's a lot of, not a lot, but there's memorable people out there that hoped this
2192000	2192800	show would fail.
2194480	2201040	There are people out there that will still try to discredit this show as whatever it
2201040	2201680	is, I'm sure.
2203680	2206640	Let me know so I can kick him in the teeth or something.
2207600	2212080	Well, you know, back in the DDR days, there were certain people in the community that
2212080	2214000	didn't like us for whatever reason.
2214800	2216640	Yeah, but we're still here and they're not.
2216640	2218160	Bingo, bingo.
2218720	2224240	So one of the biggest haters I can think of worked in the game industry for a little while.
2224240	2226240	And then as far as I know, isn't anymore.
2226240	2229040	So it's just something that's just interesting.
2229040	2229440	Spite.
2229440	2230480	Spite motivates me.
2230480	2230800	Yeah.
2230800	2232640	Spite is a huge motivator, to be honest.
2232640	2237760	And actually it is a good bit of spite on my part, because as Questbuster just said,
2237760	2240480	success is the best revenge in a way.
2240480	2241040	Yeah, it is.
2241040	2245920	I mean, this show is going to have to end someday and I don't want it to be seen as
2245920	2247120	a failure when it does.
2247760	2252880	But the fact that Loki's kids are going to take it over and they're too lazy for that.
2252880	2254080	I don't think it's going to happen.
2254080	2259520	The fact that we've gotten to this point and really achieve something that no other show
2259520	2264240	has, well, I shouldn't say show, but like no other video game related Internet show
2264240	2267120	or whatever has, is huge.
2267120	2272880	And even to, you know, there is a club of shows out there that have gone past 10 years.
2272880	2274160	You know, Bobby's in that.
2274160	2276720	And that is no small achievement.
2276720	2280560	Hell, shit, getting past one year is a huge achievement.
2280560	2284320	And all of that is to be celebrated, whether Spite got you there or what it is.
2285280	2289360	My answer would be pretty similar to Loki, though, is that when you make it part of your
2289360	2296320	routine, and it's tricky because you don't want your show to be a job, but you do want
2296320	2298480	to treat it like a valued hobby.
2299440	2306880	And I would say to many people, that's church, you know, and many people make church their
2306880	2310400	thing that they do every Sunday and they get up and they do it.
2310400	2312320	So in a way, OLR is like church.
2312320	2315280	And I don't, I don't mean to, especially in light of the things we were talking about
2315280	2318640	earlier in the show, I don't want to make it sound like sacrilegious or that this is
2318640	2319760	the replacement for that.
2319760	2320320	It is not.
2320320	2325520	But just that that is like the mentality of this, if that makes sense.
2326080	2331040	So what you're saying is we need to file for a tax exempt status as a church.
2333680	2334800	I'm reading you.
2334800	2336000	Yeah, absolutely.
2336000	2337200	Absolutely.
2337200	2339040	So let's see.
2339040	2344240	Looking at some other comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, Tigerthon
2344240	2348000	chat says having stuff to talk about every week, even during times when there was no
2348000	2350480	news, you always find something to talk about.
2350480	2352880	Well, you guys were a huge part of that.
2352880	2359920	And without sucking up too much, I do want to say, I think the choice for us to have
2359920	2366000	a live chat ever since the first day, keep that in mind, we were on IRC ever since the
2366000	2370960	first day, we've always had a live chat and a audience element.
2370960	2373600	We were taking calls via Skype.
2373600	2375840	I'm convinced I can't claim this in good faith.
2375840	2383760	I'm convinced no other show, none, took live calls via Skype before we did.
2383760	2387600	I am confident we were the first, but unfortunately, I can't prove it.
2388480	2390000	Maybe the SOL Archive will help.
2390000	2390560	I have to dig up.
2390560	2391840	Wait, it's likely.
2391840	2393360	Yeah, it's very likely.
2393360	2395280	And again, I'm not trying to toot our own horn.
2395280	2402240	Indies did pave the way, but I'm just trying to say that that element and that freshness,
2402240	2408000	that unsurprisingly, or that surprisingness that all that listener elements, I think really
2408000	2409120	have kept us on our toes.
2409120	2413840	And what TigerClaw said has allowed there to be something to talk about on this show
2413840	2418240	when it feels like there's nothing else to talk about because there's always community.
2418240	2422960	There's always what's going on in our brains and in our hearts.
2422960	2427840	Or as you heard earlier in the show, what's going on in the real world that's affecting
2427840	2433520	us that because we're a family of sorts that have been together in similarity with church,
2433520	2435840	we're a family of sorts that have been together the last 20 years.
2435840	2438720	There are things in the real world that affect us as well.
2438720	2441040	That sometimes we have to get off our chest before we get to the games.
2441680	2442960	It's all a part of it.
2442960	2445200	So let's see.
2445200	2449840	Looking at some other class, Sean 322 in chat says routine is a good answer.
2449840	2452640	Sunday nights are known for The Simpsons and OLR.
2453280	2456000	Hey, there's something that's longer than this show.
2456000	2457520	The Simpsons run on TV.
2458160	2459040	We can't beat that.
2459040	2460080	We sure can't.
2460080	2461600	We just have more episodes on them, though.
2462480	2463280	Oh, yeah.
2463280	2463680	Have we?
2463680	2464160	Yeah, we do.
2464720	2465360	By a lot.
2465360	2465600	Yeah.
2465600	2469600	A normal TV show or whatever puts out only about, what, 23 episodes a year, and we've
2469600	2471280	done closer to 45.
2471280	2476160	I mean, you would think with 52 weeks in a year, we should be past episode 1000.
2476160	2479760	And I said this when another podcast crossed that threshold of 1000.
2479760	2484640	Well, that's a huge achievement, and I'm not going to yuck someone's yum.
2484640	2487040	But they do multiple episodes a week sometimes.
2487040	2489040	And during E3, I think they did a ton of them.
2489040	2490160	So I mean, that's great.
2490160	2491920	But that's still a huge achievement.
2491920	2492800	1000 episodes.
2494160	2496080	We do take a week off here and there.
2496080	2499120	So we haven't been 1000 weeks in a row.
2499120	2501520	But real life happens.
2501520	2502080	Yeah.
2502080	2504880	We've never missed more than two weeks in a row.
2504880	2509040	And it takes a bit like when my mom passed, we missed two weeks in a row.
2509040	2512480	That was, you know, and there's been a couple other instances.
2512480	2516880	But otherwise, I would say we've always gotten at least two episodes out in a month.
2516880	2517280	Always.
2518000	2520160	So there's that, if nothing else.
2522480	2525680	Salvelus in chat says, 20 years old, still a twink.
2525680	2526640	Yeah, there's that.
2526640	2527440	There's that.
2527440	2528960	All right, let's get to the next question.
2529600	2538480	Next question is, what's been the biggest story in the past 20 years?
2539440	2540960	We've covered a lot of stories.
2540960	2542560	Remember, these are the most common questions we get.
2543360	2545280	We've covered a lot of stuff here on OLR.
2545280	2548160	What's been the biggest story in the past 20 years?
2548160	2548660	Loki?
2550000	2551200	Of course, come to me first.
2554160	2555680	Like, I don't know.
2555680	2556640	There's like so much.
2556640	2557760	Where do you even choose?
2558400	2559680	I would say probably.
2563280	2563760	I don't know.
2564560	2570160	Gosh, if I'm going to have to pick something, I would say.
2574400	2578240	The announcement of Bungee Ferret talk scene.
2578240	2583120	That was a pretty amazing story that didn't get covered by the mainstream media.
2584480	2592320	No, but I love that answer, because those little OLR cameos in other video games have
2592320	2596560	been quite the treat for us and quite the reward that even.
2596560	2601040	And yes, there's been those times where the three of us are extraordinarily frustrated
2601040	2602800	that we didn't get bigger.
2602800	2604160	We're not more well known.
2605680	2606560	And that's OK.
2606560	2611280	I made peace with that a long time ago myself, because I also realized I don't have the time
2612240	2618640	that a show needs to really work on that social networking presence to get the show as well
2618640	2620480	known as it probably needs to be.
2620560	2624880	I think people that are very well known, it's usually their jobs or something they've been
2624880	2627600	able to dedicate a lot more time to than I've been able to.
2627600	2628240	And that's OK.
2629600	2633200	But those little things like somebody made a text adventure game.
2633200	2635120	That was the very first one way back in the day.
2635120	2636880	It was a text adventure OLR game.
2636880	2639840	And then, of course, YYRS Bungee Ferret tossing was huge.
2640800	2644080	And then the little cameos that certain unnamed people.
2644080	2648640	I can't tell you who they are, but it lets you know you got friends in high places.
2648640	2653120	When we showed up in like the Namco Museum on PlayStation 3, and I just talked about
2653120	2654240	this like four weeks ago on the show.
2654240	2658160	But as a reminder, because we have some folks who have been here for a while on the PlayStation
2658160	2662960	3 of Namco Museum, when you boot up the game, it shows you a sample high score table.
2662960	2667920	And the high score table says Dark Sakura Sky, which was the name I went by for a long
2667920	2669120	time, Loki.
2669120	2671120	And then I think it's like Tangle or something.
2671120	2675360	They couldn't use Tingle, but they were trying to make a joke of Loki as Tingle as a lot
2675360	2676640	of people have over the years.
2676640	2678720	So it was like Tangle or something else like that.
2678720	2681520	So and that's in a game.
2681520	2686320	And there was a game on the Wii, an RPG on the Wii.
2686960	2688640	And I can't remember that it started with an O.
2688640	2689200	Apuna?
2689200	2689840	Was that the game?
2689840	2690880	Yes, it was Apuna.
2691440	2693040	Our logo is in it.
2693040	2694080	It doesn't say OLR.
2694080	2696240	Do you remember the old, old OLR logo?
2696240	2698560	It's not one we use anymore because it was designed by my ex.
2699600	2701200	And this is before Jamie had her degree.
2702000	2704080	It was that little orange looking thing with the stem.
2704640	2706880	I think it's still on our website because our website's that old.
2706880	2710080	But that little thing that's in the Apuna game.
2711440	2714480	So it's very subtle little things like that.
2714480	2716560	So and that's amazing.
2716560	2717600	So thank you.
2717600	2718560	Thank you for that.
2718560	2720560	So yeah, the gamer tag.
2720560	2722080	Yeah, yeah.
2722080	2724240	Def says the gamer tag for OLR.
2724240	2725600	That was pretty incredible as well.
2725600	2731280	So and that was because of our relationship with all games and the great years we had
2732160	2732400	there.
2733120	2738240	And it also goes to show together we are stronger and can leverage things like that.
2738240	2742480	So that's all good memories.
2742480	2750000	So yeah, I think for us personally, over the last 20 years, yeah, little cameos in video
2750000	2754240	games and in the industry have really shown that we've made it in a weird way.
2754240	2755440	So thank you for that.
2756560	2758160	Dark Soccer, do you want to tackle the question?
2758160	2762080	What's been the biggest story of the past 20 years for you?
2762080	2763440	The most common questions we get?
2767200	2768080	I don't know.
2768080	2774080	I mean, there's been like so many actually big stories that I can't really put a finger
2774080	2775120	on a single one.
2775920	2783280	But I reckon for me, like the thing that I guess for something I guess that would have
2783280	2784400	happened would have been.
2786320	2791760	The the just the various like news coverage, maybe the president cat thing.
2793440	2798080	Oh, yeah, when that happened, that was the one time we did kind of break through a little
2798080	2802000	bit and we all were tweeting the president cat company trying to get that game, which
2802000	2802720	was never called.
2802720	2803680	We gave it that name.
2803680	2807840	Jamie gave it that name because she was like, this name kind of translates to this.
2808560	2815600	I said that it was sort of like and I meant president as in a president of a company or
2816160	2818240	and everyone was like President Cat.
2818240	2820800	And I'm like, it's not quite what that means.
2820800	2821360	That's all right.
2821360	2822000	That's all right.
2822000	2822800	But it caught on.
2822800	2827040	It was, you know, because that was that was the same year Obama got elected the first
2827040	2827280	time.
2827280	2828960	It must have been 2008, right?
2828960	2832480	So it was the same year he got elected the first time because I remember people were
2832480	2836240	making the posters that look like his and everything that had President Cat on it.
2836240	2839440	So, yeah, that was pretty, pretty stunning.
2840000	2843360	I've had a little time to think about this question, so I'll give you an answer here.
2843360	2847680	I've got it's really hard for me to not give two and I'll explain why.
2847680	2851440	So my first answer, I would say the biggest story of the past 20 years is probably the
2851440	2854640	launch of Xbox Live and that.
2854640	2860240	But the thing is, Xbox Live launched six months after this show did.
2861520	2864240	November of 2002 is when Xbox Live started.
2865200	2872080	So it's been interesting because we've been able to, like, follow that through the
2872080	2875680	years and see how that has changed gaming's culture.
2876240	2881600	Xbox Live and the online play and the voice chat has really changed gaming culture.
2881600	2887920	And I would say evolutions of that, which would be like Discord, quite frankly, are
2887920	2893280	things that we relied on during the pandemic to keep us gamers connected.
2893840	2897680	We've always lamented the deaths of arcades here on this show.
2897680	2900240	Well, in 2020, arcades weren't an option.
2901040	2907040	So it was because of technology that Xbox Live, I think, started or really made mainstream.
2907040	2911760	I mean, some would argue that computer chat clients like Ventrilo or whatever that predate
2911760	2911920	that.
2911920	2916640	But I would argue that Xbox Live made it mainstream because it put it on consoles for
2916640	2917600	the first time.
2917600	2921600	And I think Xbox Live is probably the biggest thing that's happened in the last 20 years,
2921600	2922160	to be honest.
2924080	2925120	So that would be that.
2926720	2934880	But since that is sort of around the same time we started, I would say the other one
2934880	2940800	that was definitely something we saw the beginning, the middle and the continuation of, I
2940800	2946720	would say the biggest story in gaming in the last 20 years was the launch of Pokemon Go.
2947040	2948320	I think.
2949680	2955360	And the reason why I say that is that we all remember the summer of 2016.
2956560	2957440	We all remember.
2959200	2964240	For some people and some conspiracy theorists, that was the summer before the world ended.
2964240	2968000	And now we're in an alternate universe desperate to get back.
2969200	2975840	And I think Pokemon Go was a huge part of that because our generation grew up as kids
2976880	2982320	pretending, you know, maybe those of us here behind the mics right now were maybe a little
2982320	2983760	more college age.
2983760	2989680	But we still come from a generation that was like, you know what, mom, I'm going to leave
2989680	2990880	the house for an hour.
2990880	2992400	I'm going out to hunt some Pokemon.
2994000	2996320	And that became a reality in 2016.
2997280	3004800	And I think as well, I think the other thing of that is that it really legitimized mobile
3004800	3010880	phone gaming, which I think up until that point, most people were writing off mobile
3010880	3016080	gaming, including me most of the time, as a bunch of crap because a lot of it was a
3016080	3017200	bunch of crap.
3017200	3022240	Or it was stuff where they were trying to force things like, say, a Sonic 2 port or
3022240	3022400	so.
3022400	3026640	I don't know why I'm picking on that, but I am a Sonic 2 port that's playable on iPhone
3026640	3031600	and Android that kind of blows because they try to make a traditional controller work
3031600	3033280	with a touch controller and it doesn't work.
3034000	3039040	But Pokemon Go was designed not just with touch controls and that sort of thing in mind,
3039040	3048560	but to use your location in the real world to pinpoint and really be the first real AR
3048560	3050480	gaming in the world.
3051680	3054320	I think that was a huge moment for video games.
3054320	3058720	And as much as folks joke about Pokemon Go as a dead game, and we even have a story coming
3058720	3062800	up on it later tonight, I still think it's earned its place in the history books because
3062880	3068400	if nothing else, that summer we all needed it and we all loved it and we all experienced
3068400	3068880	that.
3068880	3074800	And mobile phone gaming broke through like it never had before, as had AR gaming.
3074800	3078640	So that's my take on the biggest story of the last 20 years.
3078640	3080800	Okay, let's go to the next question.
3083920	3090800	What's been your favorite video game of the last 20 years, but besides DDR and Bimani,
3090800	3094720	because that would be too easy considering that is where this show started.
3094720	3100000	So what has been your favorite video game of the last 20 years besides DDR and Bimani
3100000	3100640	type of stuff?
3102560	3103760	I'll start with this one.
3107280	3112400	It's actually a tricky one, but I think at the end of the day, I'm going to say Mass
3112400	3112960	Effect 3.
3114080	3115840	It would be series, isn't it?
3115840	3117200	So then just Mass Effect series?
3117920	3119360	Yeah, because that's really what it is.
3119360	3120880	It's the Mass Effect series.
3120880	3125120	The reason why I call out 3 in particular was that the multiplayer put so many more
3125120	3130640	hours in it, and I didn't hate the story the way the internet did, although I get it, you
3130640	3131440	know, and all that stuff.
3131440	3133280	I get why people were upset with it.
3133280	3138560	And yeah, again, versus Mass Effect 2 even, but just the whole trilogy is really what
3138560	3139520	it is for me.
3139520	3146080	And I think that was just the game that I played where I was like, God, I'm so attached
3146080	3147280	to these characters.
3147280	3156240	I'm so captured by this game and this experience, and it had that and getting to kill aliens
3156240	3158800	with friends online and that whole mode and that.
3158800	3161440	And I think I just got so many good hours out of that.
3161440	3165840	I mean, yeah, I probably sunk more hours and like Final Fantasy 14 or maybe even World
3165840	3169200	of Warcraft, really, if we're talking the last 20 years, I probably sunk more hours
3169200	3169840	in those games.
3169840	3175040	But I think just overall, when I walked away from the experience going, wow, that was a
3175040	3181840	video game I was really happy to play, and that was a fucking great video game, I think
3181840	3184000	was the Mass Effect series.
3184000	3189840	A close second, Journey, which we just talked about a couple of weeks on the show when Dark
3189840	3191520	Soccer picked it for the Classic Game of the Week.
3191520	3194640	I think Journey on the PlayStation 3 is a very close runner up.
3195840	3200960	To my co-host, Dark Soccer, favorite video game of the last 20 years, not DDR?
3200960	3207120	I'm going to go with the Mass Effect series and I'm going to go with Dead by Daylight.
3208640	3211920	I mean, those are just the biggest two off the top of everything.
3211920	3220480	But I mean, honestly, if I was going to go for something more overall, I would also just
3220480	3229120	throw in like the whole Beatmania series, like five key Beatmania, because that's kind
3229120	3237680	of what got me started back in on the path was playing BM98 back in 98 before there was
3237680	3241520	an Orange Lounge radio, before I had moved to the state.
3241520	3241760	Right.
3242320	3244720	Well, if it wasn't for those games, we would know each other.
3244720	3247200	And that's the simplest that really.
3248000	3252800	Yeah, I wouldn't have been shaking my butt on Para Para the first day we hung out.
3252800	3253040	Yeah.
3254720	3256000	All right, Loki, what about you?
3256000	3258640	What's been your favorite video game of the last 20 years?
3259360	3264320	If I had to pick which game I had the most fun in outside of DDR.
3265520	3267120	It's going to be Grand Theft Auto four.
3267120	3272640	I had a feeling for sure that it's by far the most fun I've had in a video game.
3272640	3274560	Close second would have to be Minecraft.
3276880	3279680	And then probably after that, I would say.
3281760	3283360	Like Skyrim, probably.
3283360	3284400	Oh, OK.
3284400	3285120	It's a good answer.
3285120	3287040	Yeah, lots of multiple games.
3288000	3289280	Yep, that is the key.
3289280	3290160	I love it.
3290160	3293440	Let's go to chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
3293440	3295440	E3VL says Persona 5 Royal.
3296640	3298400	Savalus says Flappy Bird.
3298400	3301680	I think that might be a little bit tongue in cheek, but you know, you want to talk about
3301680	3304160	mobile games that really stopped the world for a hot minute.
3304160	3304960	That would be there.
3305760	3311280	Bonds 006 kind of left a whole list, but it started with Rock Band.
3311280	3314000	That's a clever way around the DDR Bamani rule.
3314000	3318240	Dark Tetsuya says La Mulana.
3318240	3318960	No surprise here.
3318960	3320000	I know you love that game.
3320000	3320640	I know you love it.
3321920	3326080	Some of the comments on biggest stories of the past 20 years as well, because I didn't
3326080	3326800	read from that.
3327520	3329600	Savalus says Leroy Jenkins.
3330800	3331360	You know what?
3331360	3334400	I'm pretty sure the biggest meme of the 20 years.
3334400	3338480	Yeah, Savalus is probably trolling a little bit, which by the way, is Grandpa from Hoard
3338480	3341920	House, who also said the biggest news story of the last 20 years was when Hoard House
3341920	3342560	launched.
3342560	3343680	So hi, Grandpa.
3344720	3349520	But memes are a huge part of gaming culture now.
3349520	3353200	And I would say Leroy Jenkins was one of the first.
3353200	3358480	I don't think you could say the first, but one of the first that just caught on, you
3358480	3364000	know, that and YouTube's launch kind of was the perfect storm of a meme, you know?
3364000	3366160	So I'll even say this.
3366160	3371840	I will, at regular intervals, find a survivor with Jenkins in their name.
3372640	3374480	In Dead by Daylight.
3375600	3376160	I love that.
3376960	3377360	Let's see.
3378000	3383040	SheHulk10 saying, I thought Loki played Saints Row and GTA 4 the most.
3383040	3387040	I would imagine Saints Row is somewhere in your list of like top 10 at least.
3387040	3389040	Yeah, it's like top 10 for sure.
3389040	3389540	For sure.
3390160	3391680	All right, let's get to some more questions.
3391680	3392480	I have two more questions.
3392480	3393120	Two more questions.
3394320	3395040	Let's get to the next one.
3395040	3398400	Next one is what advice do you remember?
3398400	3400320	These are the most common questions we get.
3400320	3403520	And I know I get this one at least once a year.
3404240	3410560	What advice do you have for people wanting to start a new podcast or if you will, because
3410560	3413120	that's kind of where it's going these days, a new stream or YouTube?
3413760	3418400	And this is something, you know, Loki does YouTube, Dark Sakura streams, as do I on the
3418400	3419520	side outside of OLR.
3419520	3421200	And of course, collectively, we do a podcast.
3421200	3426800	What advice do you have for people wanting to start a new podcast?
3426800	3428160	Does anyone want to jump in and go first?
3429040	3432720	I will start because I literally gave advice to somebody on Thursday.
3432720	3433280	Okay.
3433280	3437520	Who actually already has an amazing Twitch channel.
3437520	3440160	It's the Elk Grove Pinball Twitch.
3440160	3440800	Oh, sure.
3442000	3448960	But he is wondering why he couldn't set up, you know, subs or anything, and it's because
3448960	3451920	he hadn't fit the requirements for affiliate yet.
3451920	3452800	Right.
3452800	3463520	And so I was like, the key, I think, to making it as a streamer or podcaster or, or any
3463520	3473120	of these things is to be consistent and to have your niche and to have something that
3473120	3482320	you're offering that no one else really has, or a flavor of something that people enjoy.
3483040	3488000	I mean, I think, I don't know if this is right.
3488000	3495200	I think that the followers that I have like to hear me complain during the match and then
3495200	3504320	be all sweetness and sunshine in the endgame chat, you know, or just, you know, trying
3504320	3509120	to do things in hard mode with, you know, this thumb track ball controller.
3509920	3517360	Or, you know, you just got to do something that's a little bit different than what everybody
3517360	3518160	else is doing.
3518160	3519760	And you have to be consistent.
3520880	3522960	The consistency is the best part.
3522960	3526240	And on top of that, you kind of have to be a little bit annoying.
3526240	3533200	You got to pimp yourself out, you know, that's why every time I go live, even though our
3533200	3537040	orange lounge thing reposts it, I post it.
3537040	3539040	I post again halfway through.
3539040	3541200	I do an announcement on my discord.
3541840	3550400	I get, you got to be able to shout your own name out to expect other people to also shout
3550400	3550960	it out too.
3551680	3555600	And yeah, and like Ron-Chan says, you have to have a love for it.
3556160	3560400	You have to, you have to, it has to be something that you got to put your heart into.
3561120	3566640	It's like, you know, when I was getting really burned on playing Dead by Daylight all the
3566640	3570800	time, you know, because it's not super rewarding to always play killer.
3573200	3581280	I would, that's when I brought about my classic SNES RPG two days a week, especially because
3581280	3584160	it's easier to do when I'm just getting off of work.
3584720	3589520	But, you know, which I put aside during the Dead by Daylight anniversary.
3590160	3597280	And then I also think that having those special one-offs are also good because they keep things
3597280	3597760	exciting.
3597760	3599280	They add a little bit more to your formula.
3599280	3599920	They're special.
3600480	3608400	That's why I do like a subathon or a follow-a-thon like every few months or so.
3609120	3615040	Um, and also I think that it really helps for you to also find a cause to support.
3616720	3626240	Um, like I'm planning on doing, um, a charity stream down the line once I figure out how
3626240	3627120	I want to handle it.
3628240	3636800	But I also think that I'm not saying use someone else's cause as a platform for yourself, but
3636800	3643120	I mean, get involved in the community and causes that you care about and you get other
3643120	3645120	people to get involved with you.
3646720	3653600	So being a force for good in your community is a great thing to do as well.
3653600	3657920	I mean, again, I'm not saying be, be kind for exposure.
3657920	3665360	That is not at all what I'm saying, but I'm saying get yourself involved, be someone who
3665360	3668160	gets involved in the community around you.
3670400	3674720	Um, I think you've said, oh, of course you've said a lot of excellent points with streaming.
3674720	3680880	The only thing I would really add to that is that, um, it can be very frustrating sometimes
3680880	3683120	when it feels like no one is watching.
3683120	3687760	And if you want to be successful on Twitch, you have to get used to the fact that nobody's
3687760	3691760	going to be watching for a little while and you still have to be able to put on a show
3691760	3692800	for nobody.
3692800	3697920	And I know that sounds difficult, but keep in mind your viewer count only updates once
3697920	3699200	every five minutes.
3699200	3702800	You don't know when someone's dropping in just because they happen to come up on the
3702800	3704800	recommended or something's going on there.
3704800	3709120	So you always, yeah, you always want to act like if nothing else, you've got the camera
3709120	3709920	watching.
3709920	3713440	And even when it seems like I'm sitting here talking to myself, you know what, tell us
3713440	3714720	what's going on in your brain.
3714720	3716640	Tell us about the decisions you're making in the game.
3716640	3718640	Tell us why you're doing the things you do.
3718720	3722880	Tell us, you know, it doesn't always have to be like you have an agenda of topics and
3722880	3723440	things like that.
3723440	3726640	Just give us some insight to the game that you're playing and that your reactions, your
3726640	3727680	thoughts and so forth.
3728240	3729840	It goes a long way.
3729840	3734400	And when that personality shines through, that's what makes people click the follow
3734400	3734720	button.
3735920	3739520	And I think, you know, and to kind of go back to podcasting a little bit, the only thing
3739520	3745120	I'd add, because I think you nailed it, with consistency, you have to stick with it.
3745200	3750960	And the minute you start making excuses, you know what, I'm going to cancel my stream
3750960	3752640	tonight because I got to fart.
3752640	3759360	Like when you start canceling things for stupid reasons, you're just letting it go.
3760000	3762160	And so you've got to stick with it.
3762160	3765520	And that's why a schedule, I don't make a streaming schedule, but a schedule is very
3765520	3766640	important for many people.
3766640	3770400	I do have a streaming schedule for this, and that's kept for 20 years.
3771280	3776240	And then the last thing I would add to that, you have to have an enthusiasm for what you're
3776240	3776720	doing.
3777280	3783840	And I don't mean, hi everybody, hi gay, welcome to Pride Month here at Orange Lounge
3783840	3784320	Radio.
3784320	3789840	I'm not saying you have to have that kind of over enthusiastic type of tone.
3789840	3797200	I'm just saying you have to enjoy what you're doing because when podcasts really blew up
3798080	3802480	when iTunes first launched podcasting and lots of people started doing them, you know
3802480	3806080	there were those podcasts that were like, oh, this was so, if you want to go back to
3806080	3809920	Horde House, there were so many World of Warcraft podcasts where you would download them
3809920	3813360	and be like, this fucking game, this fucking game sucks.
3813360	3816720	You know, you just play in this game, these changes that they're doing, they suck.
3816720	3818480	This whole expansion is terrible.
3818480	3821360	And I don't know, these quests are so lame.
3821360	3825680	We were doing this raid and the boss was, man, does anyone even test this fucking game?
3825680	3831360	It's so, what is the product that you're putting out?
3832080	3833920	You're not being edgy.
3833920	3835280	You're being pathetic.
3836480	3841200	Because you are, and the reason why I'm saying it, like a true friend is going to tell you
3841200	3846560	this fact because you're advertising, we're doing a show about gaming and then you're
3846560	3849840	sitting there just shitting on games the entire time.
3850400	3855760	That doesn't mean you can't be critical, especially constructively of games.
3855760	3858560	I like to think that's what we do here at OLR all the time.
3860240	3863680	And I know Loki gets a lot of shit sometimes from listeners because of Nintendo.
3863680	3865360	I'm always constructive.
3865360	3869840	But you do, and here we go, y'all ready for me to use a tired analogy?
3869840	3872000	Cause I'm gonna do it one more time for the 20th.
3872000	3876160	It's when Tyra Banks yelled at that supermodel on America's Next Top Model.
3876160	3877440	We were rooting for you.
3877440	3879040	We were all rooting for you.
3879120	3880000	How dare you?
3880560	3883840	That is what Nintendo makes us feel sometimes with some of their choices.
3884720	3887200	They'll get with this century eventually.
3887200	3889280	They're just only a couple decades behind.
3889280	3889780	It's fine.
3891440	3896080	So anyway, Loki, I want to give you a chance to chime in, too.
3896080	3901040	What advice do you have for people wanting to start a new podcast or stream or YouTube
3901040	3902480	or what have you, any of those things, really?
3903120	3906320	Like we went back before, it's consistency for sure.
3906320	3912160	You want to make sure that you are uploading content on a regular basis.
3912880	3916000	Try to be consistent with your schedule.
3916000	3920160	It may not necessarily be like, oh, hey, I'm going to release on every Friday or something
3920160	3920960	like that.
3920960	3925040	It's just try to release on a regular basis.
3925600	3932720	As far as more YouTube specific stuff, so algorithm is everything, obviously.
3932800	3937680	So you have to look at search engine optimization.
3937680	3945680	So that could be a lot of like how you phrase stuff, keywords that you put in your description,
3945680	3948720	keywords that you put in tags, even though they say tags don't work.
3948720	3949680	That is nonsense.
3950320	3952960	Keywords that you put in your title, stuff like that.
3952960	3958640	And you can get plugins, for example, for YouTube to show you what other people use.
3958640	3962480	And so you just look at like, hey, people that are making some real content.
3962480	3964320	What kind of tags are they using?
3964320	3966960	And then you just put that stuff in there and then you start doing it.
3966960	3968000	And then all of a sudden it works.
3969040	3971360	But that's not necessarily important.
3971360	3974640	It may get more eyes on your content, especially with YouTube.
3974640	3980160	You have to have a good thumbnail because you want to make sure people are clicking
3980160	3980800	on your content.
3980800	3982880	But at the same time, you also want to be engaging.
3983440	3989360	Don't come off as in your descriptions, in your content itself.
3990160	3993840	You know, don't come off as like, oh, I'm just not really good at this.
3993840	3995760	And I just, you know, I really suck.
3995760	4000720	And, you know, just I'm sorry that my content so bad and all that stuff.
4000720	4001760	Don't ever do that.
4001760	4006720	Just make content because what you think is bad, a lot of people will think is really
4006720	4007360	great.
4007360	4011200	And I found that out quite a bit like where there's people like, this is amazing.
4011200	4012080	I'm like, really?
4013520	4015280	Is it OK?
4015280	4017040	If you say so, it's wild.
4017920	4020320	But yeah, it's just putting out quality content.
4020320	4021600	People eventually find it.
4021600	4022960	And it's all about momentum.
4022960	4025760	It's just you need to be consistent.
4025760	4028640	You need to make sure that you're putting out quality content.
4028640	4034240	Eventually, things will kind of pick up speed as you start getting more subscribers and
4034240	4034720	whatnot.
4034720	4036800	And it'll eventually keep growing.
4036800	4039760	But you need to have that momentum and get that momentum eventually.
4040800	4044240	And don't be afraid to like kind of change up things once in a while, especially when
4044240	4050400	I do mostly Minecraft content, you know, that revolves around survival multiplayer.
4050400	4051840	That's not necessarily for everybody.
4051840	4056400	So also for yourself, so you don't get burnt out, trying different things is nice, too,
4056400	4059520	because if you're doing one thing all the time, you're just going to get bored with
4059520	4061840	it and you may want to move to something else.
4061840	4066800	So just do similar analogous things to what you're doing.
4066800	4070320	So in this case, like a hardcore series or something like that, you may get new viewers
4070320	4070880	from that.
4071840	4076160	But as far as the podcast goes, obviously having a topic that something that you're
4076160	4084400	going to want to talk about for weeks on end, having people that you want to talk to as
4084400	4090000	well, like if you have multiple hosts and whatnot, you want to be able to have people
4090000	4093280	that you gel with and they have a good rapport with that type of stuff.
4093280	4098800	So and really any of the content you do, it's just going to be yourself that's coming
4098800	4101200	through and people are going to watch it for you.
4101200	4104480	And that's kind of how it is once you get big enough as well.
4104480	4108160	It's like it doesn't matter what you do at that point, because people are coming to
4108160	4109520	watch you do it.
4109520	4112640	You know, they are clicking on the video because they want to see you play this game or they
4112640	4115280	want to hear you talk about this topic.
4115280	4119600	So that's really what it kind of I mean, I don't have the whole YouTube thing figured
4119600	4122000	out, but we're getting close to 500 subs.
4122000	4124240	We're like so close work.
4124240	4125520	Loki on YouTube.
4125520	4126020	Get him over.
4126580	4131060	So so we're almost there and you know, we're having it kind of goes in the gaming week,
4131060	4132660	but like you got to check out my new video.
4132660	4134020	It's super awesome.
4134020	4139460	The intro took a whole day, so it's hand animated frame by frame.
4140980	4142180	So that was fun.
4142180	4145140	But yeah, it's a lot of just experimenting with things and stuff.
4145140	4146900	So it's just have fun doing it.
4146900	4148180	That's really the most important.
4148180	4152100	If you're having fun doing it and you're enthusiastic about it, if you're having fun,
4152100	4153460	it's really not work.
4153540	4156740	But I mean, it is a lot of work to put out quality content.
4156740	4157700	Just don't overdo it.
4157700	4160580	You just lose track of it, of the time you're spending on it.
4160580	4163140	I think it's it's extremely stressful.
4163140	4168580	I mean, I have nothing to dissuade anybody, but like for me, it's always like it's always
4168580	4169080	a clock.
4169700	4173540	It's always a clock because like I put something out, it's like the clock resets.
4173540	4176980	But I always feel that clock ticking all the time.
4176980	4181700	And so it's just like I need to get something else out and you get something else out because
4181700	4183140	I need that clock to reset.
4183140	4188260	And then there's never seems like a break, but I don't know, you can kind of work it,
4188260	4191540	you know, maybe not feel so stressed out by that.
4191540	4196980	But if you really want to like drive the momentum and put out more frequent content, I mean,
4196980	4199700	that's what you're going to have to do is really push towards doing it.
4199700	4204020	But also remember these folks that have like millions of subscribers.
4204020	4205780	This is their full time job.
4205860	4211780	If you're if you're an adult that has, you know, you already can be like, you know, a
4211780	4216500	kid that has school or a job and a family like all that takes time.
4216500	4219460	So you're not going to be able to dedicate the same amount of time.
4219460	4221780	And don't worry about not being like perfect.
4222420	4224020	Nobody's expecting you to be perfect.
4224020	4225540	They just want you to be entertaining.
4225540	4226040	Yeah.
4226100	4228980	Viewer count is not a measure of your personal success.
4228980	4230500	And you'll learn from your mistakes.
4230500	4233940	Make those mistakes early and frequently so that you learn from them.
4234740	4241380	I want to give you this comment in chat here over twitch.tv slash vog network from a new
4241380	4241780	listener.
4241780	4242660	Good to see you here.
4242660	4245460	Arrington 20 in chat says for sure.
4245460	4248420	Collab is always excellent for great content.
4248420	4249300	Absolutely.
4249300	4252500	I love I will go on like any podcast within reason.
4252500	4254260	I want to make sure there's a legitimacy to it.
4254260	4261140	And you're sticking shout out to my fellow Channel 64 brother in hearing.
4261140	4262580	OK, but great.
4262580	4268260	OK, great example, though, through this Minecraft stuff that you've really stuck with and doing
4268260	4272100	this YouTube, even when it felt like Loki, nobody was watching.
4272100	4273220	And you've said that on the show.
4273220	4276820	Nobody's watching my YouTube, so I don't even know why I keep talking about it.
4276820	4278340	You've said something similar to that before.
4278900	4281300	And now look how that's come full circle.
4281300	4282580	Now you've done enough with it.
4282580	4283540	You stuck with it.
4283540	4287780	Now you got a crew that wants to work with you and collab on great content.
4287780	4290900	And now because of that, now people are coming over here.
4291620	4292660	It's all about fights.
4292660	4294020	Yeah, it's synergy.
4294020	4294580	That's great.
4294580	4296260	It's all about show Arrington.
4296260	4300980	It's all about finding people that are as enthusiastic about it as you because I've
4300980	4304020	been with lots of different people and not knocking any of them.
4304020	4305780	Those communities have all been great.
4305780	4306820	They've all been great.
4306820	4313460	It's just that, you know, I was looking for a group of people to be able to be as enthusiastic
4313460	4313780	about it.
4313780	4318260	And I have an unrealistic amount of enthusiasm about putting out Minecraft content.
4318260	4321700	So I was looking for a group of people that shared that kind of enthusiasm.
4321700	4322820	And it's hard.
4322820	4324500	You can get like with different groups.
4324500	4326660	And there may be a couple people that are like that.
4326660	4329700	But so far, you know, with this group, it's everybody.
4329700	4331300	Everybody has that same enthusiasm.
4331300	4333620	And it's just great because you just feed off each other.
4333620	4335620	It's just really organic.
4335620	4336340	And I love that.
4337380	4339380	All right, one more question.
4339380	4342020	I know we're spending a long time on this, but we're 20 years old tonight.
4342020	4343220	It's probably going to be a long show.
4343220	4343860	Okay, here we go.
4343860	4351140	So one more question, and that is, do you still play DDR or listen to the music?
4351140	4353460	Do you still play DDR Bomani or listen to the music?
4353460	4356660	And I got this is probably one of the biggest questions we get.
4356660	4363220	I think it's been addressed with the recent saga drama of the YouTube and the sorry, the
4363860	4368580	Discord challenge that YYR and Rama were going back and forth on a little bit.
4368580	4372420	So I think this is kind of come up recently, but I will pose it here on our 20th anniversary.
4372420	4374820	Do you still play DDR Bomani or listen to the music?
4376420	4377620	Anyone who wants to go first?
4379060	4384260	I don't as much as I don't really listen to the music too much.
4384260	4386340	At least it's not in my Spotify rotation.
4386900	4387940	Probably some of it is.
4387940	4395860	But and I really should be playing more since I have a machine in the garage to do that.
4395860	4399060	So it is something I want in your garage, though.
4399060	4401780	And summer is 100 degrees, so it's like 100.
4402340	4406980	Yeah, the garage gets up to 120 degrees, 130 degrees.
4406980	4411940	So but you know what, though, when I was actually good about exercising on a regular basis and
4411940	4416660	doing that diet and exercise stuff like I didn't let the 100 degree heat bother me.
4416660	4420820	I would just roll up the garage door and just do it, just bear with it.
4422020	4423780	But yeah, I haven't done it for a while.
4424340	4428820	I played like a few weeks ago, but I really need to go back and do it more.
4429060	4438980	Um, my answer would be I smile whenever I hear a DDR song from like Max 2 and before
4438980	4442740	Nah, Xtreme and before, because I heard the cartoon hero Speedy Mix the other day and
4442740	4443460	I did smile.
4443460	4449940	I still smile when I hear those songs, because I think about a time past, you know, and meeting
4449940	4452420	my friends and good memories at the arcade.
4452420	4455540	I can't say I actively play DDR anymore.
4455540	4463460	I think a lot of that, a lot of that probably has to do with just access and availability
4463460	4468180	of a DDR machine and partially my unwillingness to get up in front of like the teenagers that
4468180	4468820	are playing it today.
4469940	4471860	Today's my 44th birthday, okay?
4473940	4477940	There comes a certain shyness about wanting to play the game around all these young kiddos
4477940	4484500	anymore these days, but once that new place opens up, I can go over there while school's
4484500	4485060	in session.
4486020	4487540	Yeah, that's what I'm waiting for.
4488100	4491860	I want that to open up so I can play Dance Rush because I've been looking at that and
4491860	4492500	that looks fun.
4494900	4498660	So, uh, looking at chat, Savilas says, fuck, you're old.
4498660	4499380	Yeah, I know.
4499380	4500580	Pop Culture says 44.
4500580	4503220	Rob is like, yeah, screw all of you.
4503220	4507140	But I also have taken the mantle of Twitch's drunk auntie.
4508340	4509140	I love that.
4509140	4511460	Well, Dark Soccer, what's your answer to the question?
4511460	4513620	Do you still play DDR or listen to the music?
4515060	4522340	I cannot play DDR like I used to, um, just because of, of, I have arthritis in my hip,
4522340	4530180	I'll admit, you know, I can't do it, but I, you know, if I see a BeatMania machine out
4530180	4531940	in the wild, I'll stop and play it.
4531940	4535940	I do, uh, you know, when we were going to California Extreme, I would, I would play.
4536580	4542260	And I mean, in, in my streaming music, my background music that I play during my, my
4542260	4549220	live streams, I've got like a lot of Taku in there, like stoic and, uh, a few other
4549220	4549780	things.
4549780	4558500	Um, I have some, uh, other, you know, songs that have been turned into Bemani songs, like
4558500	4560740	Cat's Eye, you know?
4561620	4567300	Um, but I also was a fan of, of, you know, those original TV shows, you know, that they're
4567300	4567940	theme songs.
4568900	4575700	Um, I, uh, and, you know, there's some things that we were fans of before they got into
4575700	4580740	DDR that I'll still listen to, like, you know, sandstorm sometimes I'll, I'll feel like wanting
4580740	4583380	to listen to the old, the old things.
4583380	4589700	Um, you know, I'll even catch myself humming something even when I haven't even listened
4589700	4590180	to it.
4590180	4594660	Like I was trying to clean up the other day and I was actually humming three, two, one
4594660	4600100	stars and I was chasing the cat around and it was hilarious.
4600100	4600260	Yeah.
4600260	4604100	I actually do have Captain Jack in my playlist rotation right now.
4604100	4610820	I have in the army, I have some erotic in my playlist that I play on stream.
4610820	4614180	Um, uh, like, especially the ABBA stuff.
4615780	4618180	Do that ABBA album is fire in there too.
4618980	4619860	Um, oh yeah.
4619860	4623860	And erotic is actually still putting out, uh, they have like, I think an album, a couple
4623860	4627300	of, uh, weeks ago, smile DK.
4627300	4627940	Yeah.
4627940	4631780	Um, which I remember, I remember, okay.
4631780	4632420	Story time.
4633860	4635780	Anime expo 2000.
4638020	4641140	I w it was my Jill Valentine cosplay.
4642260	4652020	They had a DDR third mix and people like were doing the code to play, uh, uh, flat mode.
4652020	4656580	They could play it like second mix, remember, um, or putting in the code for vivid.
4657380	4661940	And I remember hearing the, the, uh, smile D was it this?
4661940	4663220	No, it wasn't smell DK.
4663220	4667300	It was the Olivia project with Xanadu.
4668340	4669940	And again, thank you for this.
4669940	4675140	Funara Xanadu is one of my favorite movies and I was singing along with it and then just
4675140	4682740	realized this is coming from DDR and promptly had to play Xanadu in combat boots that had
4682740	4686900	not been broken in for me and full Jill Valentine cosplay.
4687860	4696580	And now who's in, who's in dead by daylight, Jill, and I play Claire, but my feet were
4696580	4699220	also super torn up after that.
4699220	4700580	That was, it was great.
4701140	4711620	Um, and, uh, and I remembered being better prepared to play DDR because I had second
4711620	4716660	mix for dreamcast with those slippery ass dance pads that wanted to break my neck.
4717300	4721380	And I remember Julie bought another dance pad so that she could play it.
4721380	4724660	Well, Julie has a habit of buying stuff and then never reclaiming it.
4724660	4725460	So now it's mine.
4726340	4728500	And I learned how to do doubles at home.
4729300	4738020	And I, I just remember, you know, that, that it was, I still, I still am in love with the
4738020	4738420	music.
4738420	4739780	I mean, hold on, hold on, hold on.
4740660	4742420	Oh, I just knocked Evie over.
4742420	4743620	I just knocked Psyduck over.
4744900	4745540	This thing.
4746340	4746820	Oh yeah.
4746820	4747460	Those things.
4747460	4751860	I think those, they're cute, but I think they're kind of, they're kind of crap, but they're
4751860	4752260	cute.
4752260	4753540	It's not, it's a novelty.
4753540	4754420	It's a novelty.
4754420	4754900	Yeah.
4754900	4756020	And now I need to figure it out.
4756500	4758020	Oh, but I'm sorry for the podcast listeners.
4758020	4759460	She held up the little, um, toy.
4759460	4763380	We have to remember that there's a little toy DDR machine thing that she held up, uh,
4763380	4765140	that you've probably seen at target recently.
4765140	4765780	And then.
4765780	4766900	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
4766900	4767140	All right.
4768340	4773540	But anyway, but, but going back to the point on it is that every so often I want to hear
4773540	4774340	the old stuff.
4774340	4781380	And I want to remember, I have a lot of visual memory attached to sound as well.
4782340	4789460	And so when I have that, when I hear something, it brings back a visual memory with it, including
4789460	4794820	the one night I stayed for four hours until I could beat paranoia.
4797300	4799140	Spite goes a long way.
4799140	4800420	It goes a long way.
4800420	4801300	It's a theme today.
4801300	4801860	All right.
4802420	4806340	Those were the five most commonly asked questions we get over the last 20 years.
4806820	4807540	Thank you.
4807540	4809860	Um, for, for indulging us with that.
4810180	4812900	Gosh, that took us a lot of time for our kickoff topic, but that's all right.
4812900	4814260	It's a special show tonight.
4814260	4817940	Um, there was actually another question that came in that I thought was very interesting.
4817940	4818340	So sure.
4818340	4819300	I'll add one more.
4819300	4824020	I just don't have a fancy, um, logo or slide for it, which many people are saying nice
4824020	4825060	PowerPoint.
4825060	4825620	Excuse me.
4825620	4826900	It's open office.
4826900	4827540	Thank you very much.
4828820	4830260	This is a keynote household.
4831620	4833220	So, uh, let's see here.
4833220	4834340	Where was the question?
4834340	4836980	Um, and again, I just, I really can't stress this enough.
4836980	4838740	Thank you for the generosity tonight.
4839540	4842900	We are doing a podcast, so we don't really stop and read them all live.
4842900	4846020	I will acknowledge everybody at the end and we're probably going to have a 10 minute
4846020	4846980	editing tonight.
4846980	4848100	Um, but thank you so much.
4848100	4848820	I really appreciate it.
4848820	4849060	Okay.
4849060	4852100	Here's the question, um, that came in earlier that I thought was pretty good.
4852100	4855860	And I want to entertain this and then we'll move on to, um, our gaming weeks and headlines.
4856420	4864020	Um, pod culture asked, what's the best and the worst criticism you guys have received
4864020	4867380	over the years, the best and the worst criticism.
4867380	4870340	I have a feeling, I know where your brain is going, Jamie, and I'll let you go first
4870340	4873220	because for me, it's the easy answer is the worst.
4873220	4883140	But if you shit, whoever that was, that I, that I need to stop talking about video games
4883140	4884500	and go back to the kitchen.
4885620	4888020	Number one, fuck wad.
4889300	4894180	I probably was playing video games longer than you were alive, even back then.
4895140	4898100	And number two, fuck your misogyny.
4899060	4900980	You know, you don't want me to make a sandwich.
4900980	4902260	I'll put razorblades in it.
4904740	4909380	You can eat that shit and then shit out razorblades and intestines and all kinds of crap.
4909380	4910260	I don't care.
4910260	4914020	That's, that's the easy answer is what's the worst criticism.
4914020	4917780	And I, even if that criticism wasn't directed at me, I would still, I would have still said
4917780	4919300	the same type of answer.
4919300	4922340	Well, and I've actually, I'll say this.
4923300	4929620	I've had an email that's, or I, not me, wasn't me personally, or was it the mail bag?
4929620	4930580	You might have to remind me, Jamie.
4930580	4931860	This was a long time ago.
4931860	4936900	Somebody wrote into the show that they enjoyed listening to our banter and they enjoyed
4936900	4942740	listening to us talk about the news and stuff and our viewpoints, but that they were praying
4942740	4951060	for me because of my lifestyle as a gay man who I don't think I was with Alan at the time
4951060	4951460	yet.
4951460	4953060	So I think this was before that.
4953060	4957220	I think this would have been, I mean, most of these weird ass emails came in around the
4957220	4959460	time podcasting launched in, in Apple.
4959460	4963060	Cause that's when Jamie got her sandwich email and that's, that's when this one came in around
4963060	4963700	that same time.
4964580	4970580	And so it was just very, like, I, I don't know, like, you know, I could get on a whole
4970580	4976820	soapbox and go, it's not on pride month, not today, but I think you all know where my brain
4976820	4977620	is going with this.
4977620	4978820	It's just one of those.
4978820	4985220	I don't know what this individual thought would be accomplished from an email like that,
4985220	4989940	other than a backhanded compliment, which is really what it is, is that.
4990500	4992340	They'll have this shit going on today.
4992340	4992660	Yeah.
4992660	4995940	I like your news and I like your witty things.
4995940	4999700	I just don't like your, I just don't like your life.
5000580	5005300	And it's like, how do you think I got being gay as part of who I am?
5006020	5011140	You know, I'm not, I like to think I'm not a one note and I'm just gay, this gay, that
5011140	5014580	I'm not like, um, Jack from will and grace.
5014580	5014900	Okay.
5014900	5019060	I'm not that I have a more, I'm not a 30 minute sitcom gay.
5019060	5019860	I have a life.
5019860	5023060	I do all these things, but it is a part of who I am.
5023620	5029220	And I wouldn't have the witty banter with Loki and dark soccer or the insight to the
5029220	5030100	news and all that.
5030100	5033860	I wouldn't have that if I wasn't gay and I didn't choose to be gay.
5033860	5038420	Let me tell you with all the shit that happened in high school and some of the things I've
5038420	5041780	gotten, do you think I would choose to get emails like that?
5041780	5043220	I didn't fucking choose that.
5045460	5047620	Anyway, but you know what?
5047620	5048660	Here's what I wonder.
5049700	5054420	I wonder in 2022, you know, we've been on the air 20 years is a long time.
5054980	5064260	And while I bring that up, we have seen gay marriage be legal, then repealed by prop eight,
5064900	5066500	then repealed again.
5066500	5071140	So the gay marriage is legal again, down to justice Thomas's comment.
5071140	5073620	This last week, we already talked about that stuff at the top of the show.
5073620	5079140	I'm not going to go back down to that slope, but we've seen that whole process go through.
5079140	5082020	And in the last 20 years, I have seen minds change.
5082900	5085060	And I wonder if that person is still out there.
5085780	5088180	And I wonder if they would write that same email today.
5088740	5094260	And I hope in my heart, maybe they've had an epiphany and maybe they regret writing
5094260	5094660	that.
5094660	5097300	In which case, I forgive you if you're out there.
5102100	5105060	Uh, yeah.
5107300	5107700	Oh, yes.
5108260	5109140	Yes, Marissa.
5109140	5111140	Nothing wrong with Jack level gay either.
5111140	5112500	Absolutely not.
5112500	5116580	But I was more trying to comment on in a 30 minute sitcom.
5116580	5119060	It's all you get to see of his personality.
5119060	5123460	I hope that element of my comment isn't lost or what have you.
5124900	5125300	Okay.
5125300	5126340	And let's see.
5126340	5130900	So what about the best criticism that we've gotten over the years?
5133780	5134260	I don't know.
5134980	5136500	This is a tricky one.
5137460	5138180	I did.
5139140	5140820	This is more coming from a discussion.
5141460	5149380	A discussion that I had back with Meg Z back in the day about the power of impact versus
5149380	5149940	intent.
5152100	5160500	And you can intend on a certain thing with what you say, but it's the impact of what
5160500	5162100	you say that's going to go further.
5163140	5170980	And when we who are in this position where, yes, there are people who listen to us and
5171940	5176580	I would even go out on a limb and say that we do have a degree of influence out there
5176580	5182180	just for people who trust our opinions and like what we have to say, that you also have
5182180	5189780	a responsibility then to look at what you say and kind of judge the impact that it might
5189780	5190100	have.
5191060	5203140	Like, you know, if I were to go out and say, well, I think this person needs to do this
5203140	5205620	differently because blah, blah, blah.
5205620	5211060	And then it will come out, oh, well, she thinks that all of this is a thing and that everyone
5211060	5211940	should stop doing it.
5211940	5214740	People are going to take it out of proportion as well.
5214740	5217140	That's something else to also keep in mind.
5217140	5223380	But the thing is, is to look at the impact of the words that you say.
5224580	5225460	Does that make sense?
5225460	5226260	Absolutely.
5226260	5227060	I think that's huge.
5227700	5229700	It reminds me of that quote.
5229700	5231220	I believe it's a Maya Angelou quote.
5231220	5235540	I'm going to butcher it, but it's that whole people won't remember what you say, but they'll
5235540	5237220	remember how you made them feel.
5237220	5238980	And it's very that to me.
5239780	5240500	Yeah, yeah.
5241140	5247860	Oh, and I mean, also to quote Eddie Izzard too, you know, it's not what you say, but
5247860	5248820	how you say it.
5248820	5251300	Oh, God, yes, God, yes.
5251300	5256260	But I mean, like, okay, I actually, I actually know what one of the examples was.
5256260	5260100	It's this whole, you know, when, when people were complaining about the ending of Supernatural
5261700	5269060	and about the episode, there's an episode where there were Castiel confesses his love
5269060	5269540	for Dean.
5269540	5272980	And then everyone's like, oh, it's the ship is real, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5272980	5280500	And I'm like, but you can, you know, I was actually pointing out that it's also okay
5280500	5288020	to accept that while one man may have a romantic feeling, it's also okay for someone to not
5288020	5290420	reciprocate it the same way, you know?
5291460	5295460	And I was like, I know that you're excited about your ship and I am happy.
5295540	5298260	If that's the way that you interpret it, then good.
5298260	5300180	We need more of that in the world.
5300180	5306020	I am fully behind you, but I also want to make sure that for those of us, you know,
5306020	5313700	that for people who are ace like myself, that it's also fine to understand that, that two
5313700	5316980	men can love each other platonically.
5316980	5321700	It can even be a degree of romanticism and not want to go fuck people, you know?
5321700	5326340	And it was in that discussion that people were like, oh, homophobia, blah, blah, blah.
5326340	5327940	I'm like, do you know who I am?
5328500	5334020	First of all, and then second of all, I was like, you're not even paying attention to
5334020	5339140	it, but that's the thing that you have to think about exactly lining out word by word,
5339140	5344980	the way you are going to state your opinion so that it won't be taken out of context and
5344980	5346660	have an unintended effect.
5346660	5355940	I'm trying to think of the best piece of advice and I'm kind of torn between either
5356820	5359620	the person that, and I don't even remember who said this, but the person that said,
5360260	5365460	you know, one of these days, nobody's going to be playing DDR anymore and you have to,
5365460	5366740	then what's your show going to be about?
5367300	5370820	And that sort of allowed us to, and I'm not knocking, I know many of you are still very
5370820	5375780	passionate about the game and so forth, but I think getting away from just talking about
5375780	5380740	DDR music games was huge for this show and so important in what it is now that I'm very
5380740	5382420	thankful somebody spoke up and said that.
5383060	5386980	The other best piece of advice would probably be, you know, I was saying earlier that if
5386980	5391220	you go back to a lot of those old OLR episodes, there's probably things that we would have
5391220	5397060	said, like, you know, I mentioned Project Runway inserted the phrase hot blank mess
5397060	5399540	into our vernacular that is inappropriate today.
5400740	5405540	Or like, was it like some of the match game stuff where we just try to think of the most
5406340	5413380	most inappropriate, uh, it basically, I mean, it was kind of, we played it like, um, cards
5413380	5416980	against humanity, basically stay the most inappropriate things we could think of.
5416980	5420500	Not that we'd actually think that, but it's just like, we're trying to find the most
5422260	5422820	shocker.
5422820	5423460	Yeah.
5423460	5428260	Whereas now it's like, nah, it doesn't really seem appropriate to do any of that.
5428260	5433540	Well, and on top of that, the truth came out about the cards against humanity company,
5433540	5438420	how their office was a toxic workplace and how they abuse their employees.
5439620	5445380	So I remember we used to sit around playing that, that particular game all the time and
5445380	5451540	just how hurtful a lot of the things on there were that, you know, you couldn't do that.
5451540	5452040	Yeah.
5452900	5458260	So I, I appreciate, and my point with that is I appreciate those that have corrected
5458260	5460340	me from a place of love.
5461380	5462980	So, um, and concern.
5462980	5464260	So thank you.
5464260	5466740	And I would say that's the best feedback, honestly.
5467300	5469140	Um, Loki, do you have anything you want to add to that?
5469140	5470740	Uh, I know we've talked a lot again.
5470740	5473620	Now I have one more question that I've got to do, but you know what?
5473620	5476580	I don't, if we do questions all night and don't even get to the fucking news, I don't
5476580	5476900	care.
5476900	5479860	So let's just do more questions.
5479860	5482100	I didn't really have anything to add to that, unfortunately.
5482100	5482580	All right.
5482580	5482820	Okay.
5482820	5483540	That's fine.
5483540	5485540	Uh, let me get to this other question here.
5485540	5488740	Um, because I thought this was, this was good, uh, from Tay.
5488740	5492740	And I'm not sure if you were here earlier, Tay, and a big shout out to Tay plays games.
5493060	5494660	Who is in the last year?
5494660	5499460	And I've been on Twitch for like 10 years since it was just in TV.
5499460	5504020	I haven't taken it seriously since probably VOG came over to Twitch and all that.
5504580	5508660	But my point is just in the past year, I've learned a lot from Tay.
5509300	5516260	Just like really good ideas and like, just like the knowledge share that he's shared
5516260	5516820	with his audience.
5516820	5517780	So just big shout out.
5517780	5522580	And, you know, I think he's great and, um, uh, give him a follow, but I want to get to
5522580	5522980	this question.
5522980	5525860	I don't know if you were here earlier because we answered a similar question, but there's
5525860	5529460	a, there's a unique component of this that I think makes this worth answering.
5530020	5533940	And so Tay says, I have two questions for Rob, Jamie and Loki.
5534660	5539460	What do you think is the single best thing to happen to gaming culture in the last 20
5539460	5539860	years?
5540580	5546100	What do you think is the single worst thing to happen to gaming culture in the last 20
5546100	5546420	years?
5547060	5552900	So the best and the worst, um, of culture.
5552900	5557780	And I think that's, it's not about like gaming stories or news, like we talked about earlier,
5557780	5558740	but gaming culture.
5558740	5563940	And for me, again, I hate to start with the worst, but I like the answer is just like,
5563940	5566260	oh, easy, uh, gamer gate.
5566980	5570420	What it is, what a piece of trash that whole thing was.
5570420	5578820	I mean, just, and it's weird because in a way I would almost say Twitter was also some
5578820	5587700	of the best because Twitter gave us like that direct access to game creators for better
5587700	5588660	and for worse.
5588660	5594980	And believe me, there's a lot of worse as was exhibited by gamer gate, but there's been
5594980	5596900	a lot of wholesome moments as well.
5597700	5603460	Um, such as when that president cat thing happened and we were all tweeting that Japanese
5603460	5608260	developer and some, some poor social media answer, uh, intern or whatever on a Monday
5608260	5613380	morning over in Japan is literally tweeting back going, I'm not sure why so many people
5613380	5616100	in America are tweeting us, but thank you for the love.
5616100	5620180	And we hope to hope to have our game there someday or something like that.
5620180	5624340	It was just so there was a meeting in an office somewhere because of us.
5624340	5627460	Yes, there was a, there was definitely a boardroom meeting somewhere because of us,
5629380	5631380	but I loved that, that.
5631380	5634900	And to me, that was a, that was a great part of gamer culture.
5634900	5641300	So I would say, I would say Twitter and that social media has brought us both extremes.
5641300	5643380	It's been the best and it's been the worst.
5643380	5644020	I'm sorry.
5644020	5645140	What would you want to elaborate?
5646100	5650820	Um, I can actually add in one of the really bad things about it.
5650820	5652580	And that's, Oh my God, JV Mon.
5653140	5653640	Hi.
5655060	5655300	Sorry.
5655300	5658900	I had to, cause I know there's a lot of old faces tonight, Ella and new ones too.
5659540	5665220	Um, but I'm going to go back and to elaborate a little bit on that one, as far as the really
5665220	5676340	dark underside, as I'm going to go to in cell culture and the attacks on, on female presenting
5676420	5678100	people in gaming.
5678900	5686340	And mind you, we now exceed the overall population of gamers in general.
5687540	5693220	Um, it's, uh, I'm trying to go back to it.
5693780	5699220	It's these little angry boys on the internet.
5699220	5700260	I'm just going to say it that way.
5701140	5705700	Who for some reason, they, they can't get a date.
5706260	5716740	They, they can't, you know, they feel ignored or, you know, the, for whatever reason goes
5716740	5723700	on is they think then that this gives them the right to use the anonymity of the internet
5723700	5727060	to harass, uh, you know, women in chat.
5727940	5734420	You, you remember I got bullied off of Twitch before for a bunch of misogynist pieces of
5734420	5737220	shit that just kept pushing at me and wouldn't stop.
5738180	5742180	And I was fucking playing a pigeon dating game, you know?
5743220	5753780	And, and basically it's, it's really disgusting and really sad because these are the same
5753780	5760980	people that are now going out and shooting up schools and malls and attacking populations
5760980	5768580	of people because of their own inadequacies, their own sense of inadequacies, not feeling
5769220	5770500	supported.
5770500	5775940	And, and there is, there's, you know, that ties back into a bigger social aspect of it,
5776660	5781460	but that was originally going to be where I was going with this.
5781460	5786180	And I mean, there's lots of positives to the advent of podcasting itself has opened
5786180	5788820	up very large education channels.
5790820	5792340	That's a damn good answer.
5792340	5797140	Like just, just like streaming culture in general and the fact that we all have more
5797140	5797620	voices.
5797620	5800740	I mean, it, but again, there's a dark side to that.
5800740	5805860	We all know that, but I would like to say because we can all choose how to curate that
5805860	5806340	experience.
5806340	5808100	There's been more good than bad for me.
5808100	5808820	Well, you know what?
5808820	5810980	One of my favorite movies is Pump Up the Volume.
5811060	5812580	Oh yes.
5812580	5818020	And I keep thinking of the end of that movie where after they arrest Christian Slater's
5818020	5820660	character and what was her name?
5821940	5826980	I want to say Martha Plimpton, but that wasn't her that played the Eat Me, Beat Me lady.
5828420	5829380	I don't know.
5829380	5830580	It's been so long.
5830580	5832820	Yeah, but the two of them get arrested at the end.
5832820	5836500	And then after that, you know, again, this is like the mid nineties.
5836500	5842340	People start busting out shortwave radio sets and trying to say, Hey, I have things to say.
5842340	5843380	I have things to say.
5843380	5844660	Pirate radio, basically.
5845380	5855380	And now we are legally able to go out and broadcast the things that we have to say to
5856180	5858420	whoever the fuck wants to listen to it.
5859060	5859380	Right?
5861220	5862180	And you know what?
5862740	5867860	I don't have to be this docile little flower of femininity.
5868900	5872020	I can be a loud and obnoxious bitch if I feel like it.
5872980	5874820	I can speak my mind.
5874820	5881300	I don't have to adhere to whatever cultural norm you think should apply to me just because
5881300	5882500	I possess the uterus.
5884420	5885460	And it's freedom.
5885460	5888660	It's so freeing that we have this outlet.
5889380	5894980	And, and I'm pretty careful about, you know, keeping people from knowing where I live,
5894980	5896980	although, uh, Grandpa is where I live.
5899700	5905220	But, uh, you know, I try to maintain that I've had, you know, my, my stage name forever.
5905220	5911700	Rob and I have both had to deal with, with stalkers, you know, again, internet culture.
5911700	5912580	Oh yeah.
5912580	5913780	I forgot about that.
5914580	5914900	Yeah.
5915860	5923380	But I think right now for me personally, I'm thinking that the pros of having this voice,
5923380	5930100	and also I'm going to say another positive in this whole thing is being in my forties.
5932020	5934500	I give fewer shits, number one.
5934500	5935220	Cheers to that.
5935220	5939860	Behold the field in which I grow my fucks and lay thine eyes upon it and see that it is
5939860	5944340	buried, but also I have perspective.
5945300	5948740	I've grown up with a controller in my hand.
5948740	5951540	I grew up playing pinball.
5951540	5955300	I still cannot play Frogger well, unless I'm in roller skates.
5956580	5962500	And on top of that, the fact that we're staying with both the old and the new, we are continuing
5962500	5966180	to grow with it and have the perspective to see where it all came from.
5967060	5973540	That right then and there, I'm going to say that us old ass gamers are a positive.
5975860	5978900	We are one of the best phenomenons that's happened to gaming.
5979860	5980580	I love that.
5981700	5983140	Loki, I don't know.
5983140	5985940	I don't know if you want to follow that, but do you have anything that jumps out for best
5985940	5987060	and worst in gaming culture?
5987700	5991300	Yeah, so I I'll just go a different direction, I guess.
5991300	5994340	Um, so for worst, it would have to be swatting.
5995300	6001780	Oh, that's so good call because because people I mean, you can kind of tie it back with the
6001780	6004980	whole, you know, culture of like in selling all that stuff.
6004980	6008340	But like, yes, swatting where, you know, people can actually die.
6008340	6009860	So that's that's bad, obviously.
6011220	6015860	The best stuff I would probably have to go with, like YouTube and like Twitch, like the
6015860	6019460	streaming, you know, getting exposed to a lot of different people, different unique
6020020	6025540	things, you know, different ways to play games, different ways to experience stuff, you know,
6025540	6031460	even going back to like the beginning, you know, with machinima, there's, you know,
6031460	6035060	let's play series, there's all these different personalities that came out of it.
6035060	6042020	There's even the extent where we're going beyond like Twitch with, you know, user interaction,
6042020	6043220	Twitch plays stuff.
6044020	6049380	More recent, I like watching, for example, Doug Doug, who will incorporate his chat with
6049380	6050180	different things.
6050180	6051380	And that's hilarious.
6052740	6059940	So a lot of that stuff, I think, is really kind of elevated gaming, especially the way
6059940	6066180	we experience as like an entertainment form, you know, beyond what we've had in the last
6066180	6066740	20 years.
6068340	6069700	I excellent.
6069700	6072820	I just wanted to add to that, Jamie.
6074500	6075220	It's well said.
6075220	6075860	Yeah, well said.
6077140	6079700	Okay, we're getting some more questions in chat.
6079700	6080180	You know what?
6080180	6081780	I'm about to make an executive decision.
6081780	6083300	I think we're just gonna say screw the news tonight.
6084500	6085460	Can I say one thing?
6085460	6088660	Yeah, we can do like, like, if you have a headline you really want to do, we can still
6088660	6088900	do it.
6088900	6091220	But yeah, Stadia ain't dead, bitches.
6092820	6098660	They're expanding their servers to allow some Intel graphics servers.
6099380	6100820	And they're hiring.
6100820	6101540	You know what I'll do?
6101540	6102020	I will.
6102020	6106820	I will literally run through the news and we can spend 15 seconds on each headline, but
6106820	6107700	I'll do that at the end.
6107700	6110180	Okay, but I still want to do classic game and some of our staples.
6110180	6112340	Hey, she is not in denial about Stadia.
6112340	6113780	I can show you the links.
6113780	6114180	All right.
6114180	6115540	I've got the receipts.
6115540	6116040	All right.
6117460	6120260	Let me get because you guys have some great questions here.
6120260	6121700	So I want to get to these.
6121700	6124260	I'm trying to like copy paste these to a thing.
6124260	6126980	So we were talking about segments and so forth.
6127060	6129620	Shehole10 had a really good question here.
6130260	6133540	And that is, why did you get rid of the FUs of the week?
6133540	6137860	And not everybody may know, but we used to have a segment on the show and it was capped
6137860	6141220	off by playing the song One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.
6141220	6146500	I think we had some different songs throughout the years, but that was the legendary song.
6146500	6150740	And we used to rant about whatever was going on.
6150740	6156100	And we actually had, do you remember in the earlier days of OLR, in the Bamani days, we
6156100	6158260	had Explicit was his name, Jonas.
6158900	6163060	And when he was here for the FUs of the week, he would go on and on for like five, six,
6163060	6163700	seven minutes.
6163700	6164340	Love Jonas.
6164340	6164500	Yeah.
6164500	6165460	I adore that guy.
6165460	6169860	He does a lot of stuff with gaming rooms, anime conventions, or at least he did.
6169860	6171140	I don't know if he still does, but yeah.
6171140	6172340	I think he was still a part of that.
6172340	6172820	Yeah.
6172820	6173320	Yeah.
6174100	6178180	So it's great to see folks moving on and up and doing these things.
6178180	6180660	But why did we get rid of the FUs of the week?
6181220	6185300	And well, Jamie, it was a segment you had kind of started and I also saw you answer
6185300	6186500	this a little bit in chat.
6186500	6188500	You want to start with this and I'll follow up on it.
6188500	6189300	That's our secret.
6189300	6190260	We're always angry.
6191620	6195380	No, we just wanted to, I mean, especially since it was toward the end of the show, we
6195380	6199860	wanted to have a little bit more positivity, I think, but I don't know.
6199860	6202980	We've been sort of at the start of our show.
6202980	6206500	I mean, especially with recent things, we have been taking a go off on it.
6206500	6207940	So maybe it's time to revive it.
6208660	6213300	I, for me and the FUs of the week, like I think that's what it is, is that, you know,
6213300	6217700	we just said earlier in the show, like the advice that we have is be enthusiastic, be
6217700	6218180	positive.
6218180	6222980	And it was always weird to kind of talk about the news, but then stop and we're going to
6222980	6224100	rant about things.
6224100	6227300	And I kind of felt like we were becoming that thing with that.
6227300	6233140	Like even if it wasn't really that, it was allowing it to become that thing that I don't
6233140	6234580	like in other podcasts.
6234580	6235700	And so I was like, why are we doing this?
6235700	6239060	We're like stopping the show to do these rants when we don't even have things that we're
6239060	6240020	usually ranty about.
6240740	6245460	I understand that it is humorous to play one winged angel when we talk about these kinds
6245460	6251220	of things, but I don't think that juxtaposition was required in every episode from here on
6251220	6251380	out.
6251380	6255300	I think if we did FUs again, we need to have happy music playing in the background, like
6255300	6256900	the Ohaska or something.
6256900	6262340	And I would argue in the first 20 minutes of tonight's show, we did a giant FU of the
6262340	6262820	week.
6262820	6269140	We just didn't call it the FUs of the week, but She-Hulk and all of our listeners, that
6269140	6270900	was an FU of the week for sure.
6271860	6279700	So that's why that segment kind of got retired, but it still lives on an ad hoc basis as needed,
6279700	6281540	as you saw tonight, for sure.
6283780	6284100	Let's see.
6284100	6289220	And it's also like, we have Twitter now, so it's like, we don't have to wait for the
6289220	6291700	episode to come out to complain about something.
6291700	6294900	And honestly, there's so much to complain about every week.
6294900	6296420	It's just, I don't know.
6296420	6298340	I think people just don't want to hear it.
6298340	6300660	It may be entertaining, but we can be entertaining in other ways.
6303860	6309460	Sorry, my keyboard is so clacky that when I have my mic hot, you can hear it.
6309460	6311220	So I have to turn my mic on and off.
6312100	6315940	So it's interesting because chat is going back and forth a little bit about Stadia.
6315940	6321220	And I thought this comment from Tay is a lot of where my mind is at, is that I think cloud
6321220	6324980	gaming in general is a huge achievement that's still in its infancy.
6324980	6327620	I'm really excited to see what it looks like in five years.
6327620	6331700	And that was in reply to a comment that Pod Culture said that was, there is an argument
6331700	6334740	to be made that Stadia is a huge gaming moment in the past 20 years.
6335780	6337220	Yes, to both those things.
6337220	6342980	And I would say that when we're looking back at gaming in 30 years, I mean, who knows if
6342980	6348980	OLR is around at 30 years, but if we're looking back on 30 years of gaming, I think cloud
6348980	6350740	gaming will be at that moment.
6350740	6355940	Maybe, like I said earlier in the show, I think Xbox Live was huge.
6355940	6360740	I think we have to see where cloud gaming goes and what the derivatives of that end
6360740	6361060	up being.
6361060	6362260	And I think we're seeing a little bit of that.
6362260	6368580	I'm not just talking about straight up copycats like Luna, but also a little bit of what Xbox
6368580	6375300	Live is doing and how they are not just having the streaming that is either on your computer,
6375300	6380740	it's on the phone, you have access to wherever, but also the fact that they're leveraging
6381300	6386740	the cloud processing and all of that in more traditional types of games.
6386740	6391300	And I suppose Nintendo, believe it or not, to an extent, does this too by even being
6391300	6395140	able to deliver a game like Control on the Nintendo Switch in the first place.
6395780	6401540	So I do think we're still seeing the early days of cloud gaming, but we need more people
6401540	6409140	to get rid of bandwidth caps, such as Xfinity's infamous bandwidth cap.
6409140	6410740	Oh, it can't because they have monopolies.
6410740	6414980	So, yeah, more companies are going to have to be pressured to get rid of those before
6414980	6416340	cloud gaming can really take off.
6416340	6418740	Now, you all know I have a new provider now.
6418740	6422340	I have an uncapped provider and it's marvelous.
6424660	6429300	And I even told my former provider who was Xfinity, I said, this is the reason why I
6429300	6429620	left.
6430180	6431140	They don't have a cap.
6431140	6431460	You do.
6432100	6437220	You would think with it, you know, as GPI being gone, that we would be getting some
6437220	6438420	momentum on that front.
6438420	6440260	But like, it's nothing.
6440260	6441460	No, it's a bummer.
6442500	6446260	OK, let's get to some more questions.
6446260	6448980	And if you haven't, what's that?
6448980	6449540	I have cake.
6450340	6451460	Yes, you do.
6451460	6453220	How come you got cake for our birthday?
6455540	6461060	Because I told a certain spouse of mine that I really wanted tiramisu.
6461060	6466180	A spouse offered to go to said grocery store and find me tiramisu and brought me a tiramisu
6466180	6466980	cake.
6466980	6467700	Oh, that's nice.
6470020	6472340	I'm like, it's my actual birthday today, too.
6472340	6473940	I want freaking cake.
6473940	6475300	But actually, I'm diabetic.
6475300	6476260	I don't want cake.
6476260	6479780	My husband did give me birthday Chipotle, so I'm very happy for that.
6479780	6480820	So I will.
6480820	6481220	I will.
6481220	6483460	I will take your burrito and there you go.
6483460	6484820	Cake Chipotle.
6487140	6488100	I like this one, too.
6488100	6488980	So let's go to this.
6488980	6494420	I like all the questions, but let's go to this question from Mike Deft, who asks, what's
6494420	6502660	OLR's proudest moment, the episode or moment you would show to anyone who doesn't know
6502660	6503940	anything about the show?
6506100	6510980	What is OLR's proudest moment, the episode or moment you would show to anyone who doesn't
6510980	6512020	know anything about the show?
6513060	6514900	Proud of when you came out on the show, Rob.
6516420	6517620	That's right.
6517620	6519380	I forgot that I did.
6520020	6522580	You know, and this kind of ties back to something I was talking about earlier.
6522580	6528180	Those first couple of years of OLR, I did make a choice where I was like, you know what?
6528180	6532260	I don't want to just be the show's token gay, so I'm not really going to talk about it on
6532260	6532980	the show.
6532980	6536980	And I wasn't necessarily trying to stay closeted.
6536980	6539780	I was just saying, I don't want to talk about it.
6539780	6542740	So this subject is not something that I want coming up on the show.
6542740	6543540	And that was that.
6544180	6550180	But there was, I don't remember the moment that changed my mind.
6551140	6556660	But I think I had a fuck it moment, as sometimes is ought to happen, where you just say, fuck
6556660	6556820	it.
6556820	6557540	I'm going to do it.
6558660	6561700	And I did.
6561700	6563220	And I certainly don't regret it.
6563220	6569300	I will say some of the best reward I've had from doing OLR and going back to the best
6569300	6569780	feedback.
6570900	6575300	You know, I talked about a difficult email I got earlier, but I've also gotten emails
6575940	6577140	from three different people.
6577140	6584260	And I remember them all over the years that have said, hearing you on OLR and talk about
6584260	6591300	your life and how you live out gay and all that stuff, it's helped me accept a lot of
6591300	6591700	things.
6593860	6597460	Sorry, I said I'm not going to do it tonight.
6598340	6603460	It's helped me accept a lot of things about who I am.
6604420	6611460	And I'm not sure there's been, although I certainly don't like seeing people go through
6611460	6612900	that sort of struggle.
6612900	6613540	I've been there.
6613540	6614180	I've done that.
6614740	6615780	I empathize with that.
6617220	6622340	I'm not sure there has been a greater reward in the years of me doing this show than those
6622340	6622820	emails.
6627860	6628420	End of thought.
6628420	6628900	End of thought.
6635220	6638660	So thank you, Jamie, for remembering that because I actually forgot.
6638660	6639140	You're right.
6639140	6640820	In the beginning, I wasn't out.
6640820	6641700	I forgot about that.
6642580	6646820	I mean, it wasn't hard to figure out, but I wasn't out.
6647940	6651220	I didn't have a word for what my deal was at the time.
6652260	6653460	A lot's changed over the years.
6654180	6654420	Yeah.
6655140	6662580	Um, well, since I don't get fan emails, sorry, I don't have anything to add to it.
6662580	6667540	But no, I would say like the best moment, I don't really have a moment that would show
6667540	6673940	somebody, but like it would be like the early shows when we shared an apartment and it was
6673940	6675940	just like everybody gathered there.
6676500	6680660	I think those would probably be some moments I would show to people.
6680660	6685060	Now, the shows were obviously low tech at the time, so it probably wouldn't translate
6685060	6685460	very well.
6685460	6690580	But those were like peak fun, basically, because you had everybody have that party atmosphere
6690580	6692020	like the entire time and stuff.
6692020	6694100	So that was fun for sure.
6694100	6698340	We so like, you know, I know a lot of people joke about Episode 69.
6698340	6701540	And considering tonight, we're on Episode 920.
6701540	6703220	So this was a very long time ago.
6703860	6705860	Episode number 69 was pretty fucking funny.
6705860	6710420	And there's a reason why that show is legendary, because it is that it was at Loki's.
6710420	6711700	And I's apartment.
6711700	6718740	Sadly, Dark Sakura wasn't there, but her presence was felt the drunk show that the way Yeah,
6718740	6721060	there were other shows like it too.
6721060	6721940	And the fuck show.
6722980	6724980	We tried to be we tried to be PG.
6725780	6732580	I remember being drunk off my ass with a microphone in my hand doing this show, kicking the wall,
6732580	6733940	yelling, I'm in the matrix.
6733940	6734900	I'm in the matrix.
6735300	6741860	I don't know if I'm member being drunk in the back room and eating up all of Loki's
6741860	6742420	waffles.
6743300	6746340	I don't know if I'm necessarily proud of those shows.
6747220	6751380	But at the same time, I recognize they were pretty fucking funny.
6752180	6759380	And a moment in time, if you will, like, those are not like if somebody was like, why should
6759380	6760500	I listen to orange on radio?
6760500	6762340	I'm not going to show them the drunk episode.
6762580	6768020	I'm probably more proud of the episodes where we have had an impact on the real world and
6768020	6772340	maybe taken a stand for things we believe in, such as, like, you know, what we started
6772340	6774980	off the show with tonight, not to toot the horn too much.
6774980	6777620	But I think some of those moments have been huge.
6777620	6783060	I think some of the ways we have been personally affected in our lives.
6784740	6789620	I think that first pandemic episode where Jamie may or may not have had COVID and we
6790180	6793140	were talking about pneumonia.
6793140	6799620	Yeah, we were talking about Death Stranding remotely and talking about some of how that
6799620	6804020	is felt, you know, with the weird way the world is like some of those, like, real life
6804020	6804500	things.
6804500	6809140	I remember the episode the night that Obama went on the news and said they killed Bin
6809140	6809700	Laden.
6809700	6811860	That all happened while we were on OLR.
6811860	6812420	Yeah.
6812420	6818500	Yeah, it's things like that where, like, the real world kind of seeped in and we as gamers
6818500	6821220	and our family and our culture kind of got to react to that.
6821220	6827140	I think those were some of the moments that I thought were, like, these were real moments
6827940	6828420	for sure.
6830900	6836740	And I would say, honestly, on a completely different note, another, like, best moment,
6836740	6839380	E3 2004 to 2006.
6840020	6847940	And I know I give the ESA and E3 a lot of shit now in 2022, but damn, let Grandpa tell
6847940	6851220	you a story about when E3 was awesome.
6852180	6859540	And when we got to go and, you know, we were kids that grew up reading about E3 and Nintendo
6859540	6861700	Power and other magazines like that.
6861700	6864740	And because of this show, we got to go.
6865460	6866580	That was pretty awesome.
6866580	6871700	My favorite picture of us was from E3 in 2005.
6871700	6872200	Yeah.
6872980	6876340	Going to E3 and hanging out in the Konami booth was fun.
6876900	6883220	And, like, honestly, like, taking a step back, how special and unreal was that?
6883220	6889220	That, like, we were doing a show about DDR and Bamani and Konami, back when they were
6889220	6892660	cool, knew about it and noticed us.
6893540	6901940	Or that was the press event that they had in San Francisco and they unveiled DDR Super
6901940	6906260	Nova and I got to play DDR Super Nova before everybody else.
6906820	6913460	Loki was the first person in the US outside of Konami to play DDR Super Nova.
6914260	6914900	He was.
6914900	6915700	I was there.
6915700	6920820	What about us being able to do the Silent Hill stuff for DDR?
6920820	6921460	Yeah.
6921460	6922500	Oh, the track.
6922500	6925700	Yeah, because our friends started working there, which was wild.
6925700	6931860	And then not just that, but do you remember from DDR Hawaii when they were still around
6931860	6935700	and rest in peace still wind because he was a huge part of this and he passed away several
6935700	6937780	years ago and you probably knew that.
6937780	6944340	But he knew of this show, found this show, and thanks to him, we got to debut songs from
6944340	6944740	DDR.
6944740	6949540	We basically announced the song list for DDR Ultra Mix 4 before anybody else.
6950500	6951940	And that was because of that.
6951940	6954900	And you all helping the show to be successful.
6954900	6955460	I mean, it's just.
6956180	6957060	Holy shit.
6957060	6957560	Wow.
6958420	6959300	Didn't we have, like.
6960100	6964100	We didn't do, like, Max 2 remixes or anything like that, or was there something with the
6964100	6964500	remix?
6964500	6964980	I don't remember.
6964980	6965860	Maybe that's Ultra Mix.
6965860	6966500	I'm thinking of.
6968020	6968820	What?
6968820	6969860	Elaborate.
6969860	6970260	What do you mean?
6970260	6976100	I thought there was, like, songs that we played on our show that were it wasn't like Max 2
6976100	6976900	remixes or anything.
6976900	6977780	It was Ultra Mix 4.
6978900	6981460	It's the same thing that I was just talking about, basically.
6981460	6984740	Yeah, the Max 300 remix for Xbox, says JVMon.
6984740	6985220	Right.
6985220	6988180	And JVMon also says the Xbox DDR games are so great.
6988180	6989220	They really were.
6989220	6992260	They were like, DDR Hawaii did such good shit.
6992260	6997700	And it's just we need to take a moment to really appreciate what was unappreciated by
6997700	6998580	most at the time.
6998580	7002260	And that is the DDR Xbox games, because they were all so good.
7002260	7004820	And I'm not just saying that because we had friends that worked on them.
7004820	7007300	But yeah, it's just amazing.
7007940	7009540	So let's see.
7009540	7013060	I thought I feel like I missed a question somewhere along the way.
7013060	7015460	If I didn't get to your question, will you please post it?
7015460	7019460	Just because there's so many of you in chat tonight, and I'm so thankful.
7019460	7022180	Hugs, but I'm having a hard time keeping up on chat.
7022180	7025700	But we did get another question that came in down here towards the recent stuff.
7025700	7026900	So let me get to this.
7027540	7034340	So Tay said, if we're keeping this AMA open, I do have another question.
7034340	7034900	Sure.
7034900	7035860	You know what we already said?
7035860	7037940	We're gonna say fuck the news tonight and just do your questions.
7039300	7042020	I'd love to know more about the logistics of the show.
7042660	7046420	Do you all chat about the show topics the night before?
7046420	7047860	30 minutes before?
7047860	7050420	Is there a shared Google Doc about topics?
7050420	7051860	Who picks the topics?
7051860	7053780	Who does the editing and recording?
7053780	7056020	Who uploads stuff to podcast services?
7056020	7057460	Who does social media?
7057460	7059540	Is there one person or do you split it?
7059540	7061140	Feel free to answer any of those.
7061700	7065460	Okay, so there's a lot of components there.
7065460	7069380	So let me just explain what goes through an average OLR episode.
7069380	7072020	So I kind of gave away earlier in the show.
7072020	7077220	There's a secret forum that is the reason why forums still exist on VOG Network.
7077220	7080980	And on that forum, people will post stories throughout the week.
7080980	7083460	And that is meant to be kind of like a sticky board.
7083460	7085460	So like a Google Doc type of thing.
7085460	7087380	So Loki will post his stories.
7087380	7089300	Dark Tetsuya posts things.
7089300	7092340	VX Jason, our voiceover guy, shout out to Jason.
7092340	7095220	Couldn't have made it 20 years without you in many, many ways.
7095220	7098580	And Bobby sometimes will chime in with the topic as well.
7099300	7103460	I don't really post stuff there because I'll explain why in a minute, but they'll all post
7103460	7104180	things there.
7104180	7109460	Dark soccer emails it to me because for some reason, her computer doesn't like the old
7109460	7110580	forum software, to be fair.
7110580	7112340	It's probably a compatibility issue with the old forum software.
7112340	7114740	Like it keeps you setting my password for some stupid reason.
7114740	7121940	Well, I found that my new system kept trying to block it through the AT&T firewall and
7121940	7124900	I had to like set VOG Network as an exception to get around it.
7124900	7126660	So it's just, there's some dated tech.
7126660	7128580	That's the problem with running a 20 year old show.
7128580	7129700	It's dated tech.
7129700	7138180	But anyway, so I will then compile all of that into one show role that I basically use
7138180	7142500	OpenOffice Excel to put together every week.
7142500	7143460	And you know what?
7143460	7145620	Since you all asked, why not?
7146740	7149300	Let's be completely transparent.
7149300	7149860	There you go.
7149860	7151540	That's what an average show looks like.
7151540	7152980	And that's the one for tonight.
7152980	7155620	And it shows you everything we're going to be talking about tonight.
7155860	7157300	That we were supposed to be talking about.
7157300	7160740	Yeah, so that's why I'm showing this one, because we're not going to get around to
7160740	7163220	these topics, but this is what we would have been talking about tonight.
7163220	7166820	I also know it's very tiny because, let me see, I'll just do a control scroll.
7166820	7168500	So there you can see what it actually looks like there.
7170180	7171940	So you can just see like, that's everything.
7171940	7176500	So I compiled this into that Excel kind of template that we've used.
7176500	7178980	We've used this template over 10 years.
7178980	7180820	It used to be a Word doc.
7180820	7183460	And then at some point it sort of switched to this thing.
7183460	7185380	So it's just, you know, once in a while we changed that.
7185780	7186260	Wrong shot.
7188020	7188420	Let's see.
7189380	7190820	I'm forgetting components of that question.
7190820	7191300	So then what?
7191300	7196340	Then, so no, we don't really meet beforehand because we kind of know, like the show roll
7196340	7198580	kind of lays out who's going to talk about what.
7198580	7203620	But we all also, we have a relationship over the past 20 years where we just know.
7203620	7207060	We might step on each other's toes a little bit and you just have to roll with it.
7207060	7208100	It's live radio.
7208100	7209620	That's what we signed up to do.
7209620	7211220	There is no second takes.
7211220	7213140	Well, there can be.
7213140	7215060	If I fuck up the intro, there'll be a second take.
7215060	7217220	We've had the do over on occasion.
7217220	7223140	But there's very rare second takes, you know, of like actual content in the show.
7223140	7225540	And usually it's because of tech issues or whatever.
7226100	7227220	That sort of thing.
7227220	7230980	So that is kind of how the show all comes together.
7231860	7236980	Now I am the one pushing the streaming button and all of that stuff because remember Tay,
7236980	7242580	and you may not know this because I think we've only met during the pandemic, but pre-pandemic
7242580	7244580	we did this show in person.
7244580	7251780	So Jamie and Loki came over to my house and for a little while it was at Jamie's house.
7251780	7254260	I would say in the, what era was that?
7254260	7259300	It was probably the Shermy era, probably around 2009 to 2012 or something like that.
7259300	7264100	It was at Jamie's house, but there was like, Rob had a computer because I just kind of
7264100	7267060	knew I, at this point, I just knew how to do it.
7267060	7269780	And like, Jamie could back me up if she had to.
7269780	7270660	And she did one night.
7270660	7273940	Like I remember Tiara hosted one night and I wasn't here and they took over the show
7273940	7274440	for a night.
7275300	7280500	But like most of the time, you know, I was doing it and that was, you know, it's whatever.
7280500	7283540	It's just what happened over 20 years is I just learned how to produce.
7283540	7288420	So I'm still doing that to this day, basically, even in the virtual environment that we're
7288420	7288920	in now.
7289860	7291300	And Tay says, oh, I didn't realize that.
7291300	7295460	Yeah, so it was a little, so even the show role and all that stuff, that was the exact
7295460	7297140	same way when we were in person.
7297140	7298660	So that's how that was done.
7298660	7304820	And then as far as uploading and putting it on the feed, I do it, but it's not as intensive
7304820	7307300	as you think it is because all I do.
7307300	7314660	So while this is broadcasting to Twitch, I am also recording a localized movie file of
7314660	7315220	this.
7315220	7317380	My solid state drives allow me to do this.
7317380	7322820	After the show, I will open up the movie file in my audition from like the year 2006 that
7322820	7325380	still works and is what I edit the show on.
7325380	7331940	And I will crop the show, meaning I'm cutting out the like, you know, the cat video and
7331940	7334660	the things that you see on Twitch, you know, it's here in the podcast.
7334660	7338660	And then at the very end, the part after, OK, we're done, let's wrap it up, you know,
7338660	7340500	that that so it's just the show.
7340500	7348740	And then I post that MP3, the website everything is running on was built is really maintained
7348740	7350420	by Jason, our voiceover guy.
7351140	7355460	If not for Jason, there would not be a place to put this show.
7355460	7359300	And that's why I say Jason helps this show in many ways you don't even hear.
7360100	7362580	And we're incredibly thankful for that.
7362580	7367060	And the actual website that's like Joomla, which is really old, but Deep Man did that
7367060	7368020	a long time ago.
7368020	7374340	I completely realize the website is showing its age, but I also argue is a website as
7374340	7380660	important these days as a Twitter, as a Twitch, as our Twitch channels got to be more good
7380660	7384980	looking than a website at this point, because you all subscribe in iTunes and probably don't
7384980	7385860	visit the website.
7385860	7386980	It's that so.
7388660	7390260	God, did I hit all the questions?
7390260	7392580	There were a lot of questions there, which is great.
7392580	7395300	I'm totally fine giving you a peek behind the curtain there.
7397300	7398260	Who uploads stuff to pocket?
7398260	7399460	Who does social media?
7400420	7407380	Mostly me on Twitter, although Facebook, we don't really use that very often, but we've
7407380	7408740	all been known to kind of hop on that.
7409380	7410900	Facebook is garbage anyway.
7410900	7413780	Yeah, I don't use it so much anymore.
7413780	7419460	Social media, and that is probably the blind spot that I wish we got more involved with
7419460	7424340	and we probably need to, and especially try to keep up with the newer trends like TikTok.
7424980	7428500	I don't fucking know how to clip this show for TikTok.
7428500	7430420	And that's where I might need a little help.
7430420	7432180	Just play it really, really, really, really fast.
7432900	7434980	I can handle that.
7434980	7436340	I mean, that part's not hard.
7436340	7439220	It's what I do with my stream when I remember to.
7441460	7444020	Okay, let's see.
7445300	7446340	Some more questions.
7446340	7448980	I'm trying to load my queue here so I don't forget anything.
7448980	7454980	Okay, let's go to Pod Culture who asks,
7454980	7459940	you guys mentioned the best games in the past 20 years.
7459940	7464340	What's the worst or most disappointing?
7464340	7467060	And I think that opens the door to some very different answers.
7467060	7468980	WCW Thunder.
7469940	7474820	That was so bad that Dan and I returned it to the store, to the blockbuster video.
7478740	7480020	Loki, worst game?
7480660	7485220	I'm trying to think most disappointing.
7485220	7488020	I know there's going to be something and I can't think of it.
7488020	7491700	And then as soon as I think of something, it's going to, I'm going to remember what it is.
7495860	7499860	Gosh, I don't know.
7499860	7502100	I mean, I don't know.
7502100	7503300	Give it a couple months.
7504740	7506180	I would say, okay, no, no, no.
7506180	7511780	Most disappointing, I think for me would be Saints Row four.
7512820	7514180	That's most disappointing for me.
7515140	7517460	Possibly the new Saints Row game when it comes out.
7517460	7518740	Although that looks pretty good.
7518740	7519620	I mean, it looks okay.
7520340	7523060	I mean, I kind of just ignore the characters right now, but.
7525620	7528020	Yeah, Saints Row four, I think was pretty disappointing.
7528020	7530900	I know there's other things that are more disappointing that
7530900	7533380	I'm probably just not thinking of right now.
7534020	7541940	If I use my DDR Bahmani roots as a little bit of a crutch here, but I think it's a real
7541940	7542660	good answer.
7542660	7548340	I would say beat and groovy on the Xbox 360, because that was what we got to represent
7548340	7551940	the very popular Japanese arcade series, pop and music.
7551940	7553860	And boy, did they fuck it up.
7553860	7555780	Boy, did they fuck up that game.
7555780	7562020	And that could have been like the launch of a new music franchise on Xbox arcade.
7562020	7563780	And they could have done such a good job with it.
7563780	7567460	But what they gave us felt half baked and incomplete.
7567460	7568260	It was terrible.
7568260	7571220	It was embarrassing as a Bahmani fan.
7571220	7571460	Yeah.
7571460	7573460	Dark Two Seas says that game had nine songs.
7573460	7575460	Beat and groovy was embarrassing.
7576020	7581940	So I think just as somebody who, you know, who star on this show is because of music
7581940	7583460	games and that sort of thing.
7583460	7585060	That game fucking sucked.
7585060	7586340	And that was, yeah.
7586340	7586900	Orange Wright says-
7586900	7587540	A disappointment.
7587540	7587780	Yeah.
7587780	7591380	Orange Wright says beat and groovy felt like a game they released just to protect a patent.
7591380	7592500	Absolutely.
7592500	7597380	I'm trying to think if I have a more shocking answer, like a big budget game or something
7597380	7599540	that I bought and I just really didn't like.
7600500	7604260	But honestly, I don't know if anything was more disappointing than that, to be quite
7604260	7604660	honest.
7604660	7606340	I'm really trying to struggle to think.
7607300	7609460	And I'm not sure I'm coming up with something.
7609460	7610100	I'm trying to think.
7610100	7614500	I feel like there's been like a remake or something that really pissed me off.
7616420	7618020	But I'm coming up short in the moment.
7618580	7619540	No, I'm good.
7619540	7620100	Good.
7620100	7620660	Good call.
7620660	7623300	Pod Culture, No Man's Sky version one.
7623300	7625700	I didn't hate it as much as everyone else did.
7625700	7631700	I don't love it as much as I love it now, but I also didn't buy into a lot of that pre-game
7631700	7632020	hype.
7633940	7635700	Oh, Orange Wright.
7635700	7636100	Yes.
7636740	7639060	Original Final Fantasy 14.
7639060	7640020	What a turd.
7640660	7644740	What a turd of a game that was just, just bad.
7645300	7648340	Tay says Spore was a fucking massive disappointment.
7649540	7654020	I actually don't know if I hated it as much as everyone else did, but you know what?
7654020	7659700	Going back to the earlier question about best moments and because of Orange's radio and
7659700	7660660	everything that's been done here.
7661700	7665860	I got to it E3 2005, maybe 2006.
7665860	7674180	I got to sit in a room, a small room, and watch Will Wright, the man himself, play Spore.
7674820	7676660	And walk us through that game.
7676660	7681380	And maybe it's because of that memory and the fact I have that sentimental kind of thing
7681380	7686660	to it that I forgive that game a lot more than most people.
7687300	7689620	And that was a moment to get to see him.
7689620	7694020	And it's like, wait, this is the great game maker, Will Wright, actually playing this
7694020	7695460	in front of me right now.
7695460	7696340	This is incredible.
7698100	7700340	At that same E3, I heard it.
7700340	7702660	Now I didn't see this one, but I heard that was the one.
7702660	7708740	And as famous as where Robin Williams showed up and he did one of the Spore walkthroughs
7708740	7711140	and it was apparently pretty legendary.
7711140	7716420	And, you know, again, one of the latest, late greatest people anywhere.
7716420	7720260	You know, that was that's just kind of it built a lot of hype for that game, for sure.
7720260	7721460	But yeah.
7723060	7723380	OK.
7726740	7729780	Pixel Pacas asks a very good question here.
7730660	7732820	And I must say, last call for questions.
7732820	7736260	Last call, if you have one or two more, we'll get those and then we'll do some of our other
7736260	7737140	segments.
7737140	7744980	Pixel Pacas in chat says, Where did you go to find information about how to start broadcasting
7744980	7746820	OLR online to begin with?
7747540	7753140	Today, it's easy to find how to guides or YouTube videos, but I'll assume that level
7753140	7754820	of help didn't exist at the time.
7755940	7757780	That's a great fucking question.
7758420	7760820	And I'm really having to tap my memory bank.
7761860	7769060	So I remember originally reading about podcasting on a Web forum, and I don't remember which
7769060	7776260	forum, I'm sorry to say, but I remember reading it described as TiVo, but for the radio.
7776260	7777780	And that's how I heard it described.
7777780	7784020	And that's when I said we need to fucking get on that because, you know, we were at
7784020	7788260	that point with doing Orange Lounge Radio where I was like, man, we're really like,
7788260	7791540	I feel like more people are listening to us, but man, I really wish I knew how we could
7791540	7792420	just like even push.
7792420	7797140	And then when I thought somebody could just download the show and listen to it whenever
7797140	7798100	they want.
7798100	7798820	Oh, fuck.
7798820	7799620	That's that's it.
7799620	7802420	That's what we got to do, because I've had so many people tell me I'd love to listen
7802420	7804260	to OLR, but I'm busy Sunday nights.
7804260	7805540	I do this other thing Sunday nights.
7806100	7807940	So I said we need to get on that.
7807940	7808740	Absolutely.
7808740	7813060	But then I also realized, oh, and some of you know this about the old OLR.
7813060	7815780	And if you go to the archives, you'll see this, the old live show.
7815780	7817380	We played music breaks.
7817380	7820260	We played DDR music and dance meetings during the breaks.
7820260	7827060	So I was like, copyright isn't going to let us put that out on a podcast and let us
7827060	7827860	download it.
7827860	7830180	We're going to have to do a separate show.
7831140	7832740	What could we do a separate show about?
7832740	7834980	OK, OK, so there's music games.
7834980	7839860	What if we did a separate show about all the games, all video games?
7839860	7845620	And that's where the first 20 minutes to go edition came from, was us doing other headlines
7845620	7847700	and not playing copyrighted music.
7847700	7853060	And yeah, there was a while when we would do a three hour with music Orange Launch Radio
7853060	7859700	and then 20 minutes to go afterwards and then 30 minutes and then 40 minutes and then 60
7859700	7860500	minutes.
7860500	7867460	And now it's we're spending four hours, sometimes more here doing all of this.
7867460	7871780	And it's like fucking 1030 before I have to drive home.
7872580	7875140	I meaning dark soccer, Logie, whatever.
7875140	7876340	And do you know what?
7876340	7878020	And so it was like, oh shit.
7878020	7884420	And then somewhere in the middle of that, Apple launched podcasts and there was a brief
7884420	7889700	amount of time where there were thousands of people listening to this show every week.
7889700	7890500	Thousands.
7891380	7894820	And there were 45 that were here live.
7895460	7897140	We love the live audience.
7897620	7898980	We love you all.
7898980	7900100	You guys turn it out.
7900740	7905700	But surely you have to understand the perspective, the sudden conundrum we were faced with is
7905700	7909380	that your spinoff show is now popular than your main show.
7909700	7910740	How do you fix this?
7911780	7918900	And so we reinvented the main show to remove the music breaks and basically become an elongated
7918900	7920020	to go edition.
7920580	7925780	But with some of our segments, like classic game of the week, I'm not sure it started
7925780	7926180	at that point.
7926180	7928740	It might have still been like your website of the week or one of those segments that
7928740	7929780	came before it.
7929780	7935220	But I remember doing website of the week and then the Weebill and Bob folks messaged us.
7936180	7937540	Oh, my God.
7937540	7938660	That's right.
7938660	7940100	Oh, that was wild.
7940900	7941380	That is.
7941380	7941860	Yeah.
7941860	7943860	So yeah, I just have to stop.
7944900	7946980	I just saw Didi Archaholic in chat.
7946980	7948180	Oh, my God.
7948180	7949140	Blast from the past.
7949140	7950580	I am so happy to see you.
7950580	7953380	It's so nice to hear and see you guys again.
7953380	7954900	The seeing part is amazing.
7954900	7957540	Now you guys have come so far, isn't it?
7957540	7957940	Isn't it?
7957940	7959860	Technology is wild, my friend.
7959860	7960820	It's so good to see you.
7960820	7963620	Yes, I will stop this entire fucking show just to say hi to you.
7963620	7963940	All right.
7968500	7971460	So anyway, gosh, where was I?
7972660	7973380	I don't know.
7973380	7976740	My whole excitement for seeing Didi Archaholic totally derailed where my brain was with that
7976740	7977140	question.
7977140	7979460	But oh, yeah, the question was about how to guides.
7980820	7984420	So I don't remember.
7984420	7988900	I remember trying to figure out how to get to the podcast.
7988900	7992500	I had to download a thing called Lemon Pod, I think was the first because it wasn't an
7992500	7992900	iTunes yet.
7993460	7995700	So I had to learn about how that all worked.
7996420	7997460	I want to say.
8000340	8005780	Jason, somebody behind the scenes kind of was like audio RSS.
8005780	8007140	I think I know how to do that.
8007140	8009140	I don't think that doesn't seem too hard because that's all it is.
8009140	8012100	It's like RSS, like a blog, but it's attached audio file.
8012100	8013380	I think I know how to set that up.
8014740	8015300	And that was it.
8015300	8016980	So I did have a lot of help.
8016980	8024020	So on the back end, because Jason built the podcast script that is still in use today.
8024820	8028660	Might I point out that was built for the original Orange Songs Radio To Go edition.
8028660	8030500	Episode one is still in use today.
8031060	8032180	And Jason built that.
8032180	8033780	I didn't do anything with the tech with that.
8033780	8036580	So I guess I had a little help PixelPakas.
8037300	8043300	It's nice to have friends and community that help you with that sort of thing.
8047300	8048580	We're always thankful for that.
8048580	8049220	That's for sure.
8051380	8052020	Okay.
8052020	8055060	I don't know if any other questions came in, but I'm looking through chat.
8055060	8056500	Drew Nami showed up.
8056500	8058100	Oh, talk about blast in the past.
8058100	8058500	It's so.
8059380	8061060	I'm like, you better get your ass in here.
8061060	8064580	This is better than going to your high school reunion, which I never went to any of mine,
8064580	8067220	but this is even better than that.
8069700	8075860	I feel like I missed a question somewhere along the way that said something about the
8075860	8077380	next 20 years.
8077380	8079620	And like, what was it?
8079620	8083300	I might've missed it, but something about the next 20 years and I'm sad I missed it.
8083300	8090260	But honestly, my original reaction to that question was I'm not sure this goes another
8090260	8101060	20 years, and I don't want to sound defeatist or whatever, but keep in mind another 20 years,
8102100	8107220	we're going to be 64, 65.
8108980	8117540	I think we kind of have to accept that there's going to come a time when it's time to say
8117540	8128100	we did a great thing here, and now we're going to hang up the mantle and let others carry the torch.
8128100	8136020	I know Dark Sakura's joked about Loki's kids doing it or Julian or whoever out there.
8137220	8142420	It's kind of funny because I know there are podcasts out there about the DDR scene today,
8142420	8145620	and I know they don't know who the fuck we are, and that's okay.
8146500	8150980	I still see it a little bit as passing the torch, if that makes sense.
8150980	8154340	So it's like when you start to see that next generation come up and you kind of go,
8154900	8156340	yeah, the kids are going to be all right.
8157060	8164580	I think is when you start to say maybe it's okay to start to wind it down.
8165780	8172580	So I just kind of, but at the same time, I've been saying that since episode 100.
8175620	8178660	So we'll see.
8181700	8185460	Yeah, now people are saying OLR in the multiverse and all that stuff.
8186740	8191060	JVMON, oh my God, so good to see you, says, nah, OLR till the 50th anniversary.
8191700	8196580	TayPlaysGame says, in 20 years we will be rebranding to AARP radio.
8196580	8198900	DarkTosia says, OLR the next generation.
8198900	8201380	Or PodCulture says, strange new worlds.
8201380	8204020	Yeah, a whole universe.
8204020	8210340	Well, I mean, if you think about universe, OLR was a spinoff show.
8211540	8214500	I'm not going to hide or be embarrassed because I'm not.
8214500	8220340	I'm proud of the fact that this show is a spinoff of sorts, of Travis Donovan's
8220340	8226740	Understandation Live, and Travis Donovan was the man that taught me any idiot can podcast.
8229620	8232180	And I'm so thankful to him for it.
8232180	8237220	And this show, I'm well aware, and I'm thankful, has spun off other shows.
8237220	8242660	Rama's been very upfront and saying anime jam session is a big part of, you know,
8242660	8246260	it's spinoff from what we do here at Orange Launch Radio and all that good stuff.
8248100	8249380	And all of that.
8249380	8255940	So it's funny because we, but there is kind of an OLR universe already that we fit into.
8256660	8259700	So yeah, go ahead.
8260340	8269140	I would also like to point out that 60 isn't really that old anymore, being in your 60s.
8270020	8270500	No, I know.
8270500	8275780	And who knows, maybe OLR won't be around, but maybe we'll still be podcasting.
8276340	8277300	Exactly.
8277300	8277860	Exactly.
8279860	8283460	And some other comments in chat here.
8283460	8285780	Where is Travis, says Rama.
8285780	8288580	Ultimately, and I'm not trying to say this in a shady or whatever way,
8289540	8290420	you'll have to ask him.
8291060	8297620	But Travis did retire from this biz, and he's probably hanging with the wife and kids.
8297620	8298260	And that's OK.
8299060	8304260	You know, so that's what he's, you know, I can still say I'm so thankful that, you know,
8304260	8308100	he helped show us how to set up a studio and things like that.
8308100	8309940	I knew the audio components I would need.
8309940	8316660	I knew what needed to be there to be going into a live 365 station.
8316660	8319220	But ultimately, you're going to have to ask him.
8319220	8324260	He may not even honestly, because this happens to also be my actual birthday.
8326420	8329300	Nothing I'm posting on Facebook is going to get through today.
8329300	8332660	So Travis may not even realize it was tonight, to be quite honest.
8332660	8333220	And that's OK.
8333780	8335860	He doesn't have to circle it on his calendar or whatever.
8336500	8340580	So let's see.
8340580	8342340	JV Mon says, where's Shane?
8342340	8343140	Text him.
8343140	8344580	If he's here, he lurks.
8345140	8351620	But I will say, holy shit, Shane and I had a hilarious stream on Friday night, I think
8351620	8356020	it was, because Final Fantasy 14 wasn't working.
8356020	8359220	It was super laggy and it was cutting in and out and all this stuff.
8359220	8362580	So I was like, all right, I'm just going to switch to Dead by Daylight because I have
8362580	8363780	that up and ready to go.
8363780	8366260	It's very easy for me to hit the button to stream that.
8366260	8368020	I'm going to do that as opposed to something else.
8368020	8371140	And Shane was like, I'll stay on, whatever.
8371140	8373540	And I'm like, OK, you know nothing about this game.
8374100	8375220	He's like, yeah, it'll be fun.
8375220	8377860	He's like, ooh, ooh, you should let me pick your killer.
8377860	8379380	And I'm like, all right, let's do this.
8379380	8380740	That was funny.
8380740	8387540	And then, oh, my God, it's like listening to grandma describe Pokemon because he literally
8387540	8391300	didn't fucking know who Freddy Krueger was.
8391300	8392180	Or Myers.
8392180	8393140	Or Myers.
8393140	8397060	And he would be like, oh, no, Bubba Leatherface.
8397060	8399140	He was like, that's Butthead, right?
8399140	8400100	From Beavis and Butthead.
8400900	8405060	It was so I made a highlight of it.
8405060	8406820	It's on my personal channel at Rob Roberts.
8406820	8408500	I highlighted that whole section.
8408500	8409300	It was so funny.
8409300	8410580	He guessed pig, right?
8410580	8412340	Well, he said no, he said Miss Piggy.
8412340	8414660	He said Miss Piggy, but still close enough.
8419060	8420900	I like what did he call nurse?
8422340	8423060	Pillow face.
8423060	8424420	Pillow face or something like that.
8425860	8429460	Pillow face, which was fairly accurate there, too.
8429540	8430820	She had a pillowcase overhead.
8430820	8431060	Yeah.
8431060	8434100	So that was a fun little side stream.
8434100	8439380	And you got a fucking 5K with Ghostface with whatever weird ass build he made for you.
8439380	8439540	Yeah.
8439540	8442740	He also picked my build and he was giving me shit perks because he doesn't know what
8442740	8443460	he's picking.
8443460	8447940	I actually had my you weren't there because you came in when Tay raided me.
8447940	8448580	Right.
8448580	8454500	So you only saw that he had just he was picking his perks for you.
8454500	8456980	So you didn't see my survivor matches.
8456980	8460340	And in my survivor matches, I said, okay, Shane, pick any perk.
8460340	8463860	And like the first one he says, he goes carpal tunnel syndrome.
8463860	8464820	Do that one.
8464820	8466180	I'm like carpal tunnel syndrome.
8466180	8466820	Which one's that?
8467540	8468180	No, neither.
8468820	8470260	Oh, was the one he was.
8470260	8470900	I said no.
8470900	8473140	I said, Shane, I'm going to put my foot down.
8473140	8480100	That is the one perk you are not allowed to pick because it's the only perk that actively
8480100	8481540	hurts your character.
8481540	8483140	And it's going to get me targeted.
8483700	8485300	Thank you for saying it correctly.
8485300	8486020	I looked it up.
8486580	8487060	Oh, yeah.
8487940	8488820	It's no, neither.
8488820	8490580	Yeah, I've heard enough streamers say that.
8490580	8496580	It is Northern English slang for being annoyed for bitching.
8497460	8502420	So it's like if you can't be bothered or can't be annoyed by it, it's no, neither.
8502420	8507220	But yeah, but I love Shane's day for carpal tunnel syndrome is the name of the perk.
8510180	8510580	All right.
8511380	8515780	But I got fucking tunneled out of the game by a nemesis my first match.
8516340	8520180	Like my teammates were being awesome and trying to take hits and stuff.
8520180	8521620	And that nemesis didn't care.
8521620	8524740	And we think it was because of the pride charm, which sucks.
8524740	8530660	But that shows how long ways we have to go in gaming.
8530660	8531860	Me trying to play Claudette.
8534260	8535300	Got tunneled.
8535300	8540740	It's just some people's children.
8540740	8542900	And not prestige, but adapted her.
8542900	8543220	Nice.
8543860	8545620	I have seven survivor adapts, Rob.
8546580	8549380	As of right now, they're easier than the killer ones though.
8549380	8550100	Aren't they?
8550100	8550420	Right.
8552660	8556020	But, but I mean, this is what I'm doing.
8556020	8559780	I'm actually taking a, I'm doing what I'm doing with all the new killers right now.
8560500	8563940	And just the first time I play them, I'm only using their default stuff.
8564900	8568340	And once I adapt them, then I can, you know, like right now.
8568980	8572180	Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.
8572180	8573700	I have to tell you something about that.
8573700	8575540	Cause Rob and I were talking about this before.
8575540	8576500	I know I'm going off topic.
8577300	8582740	So Tay asks, spinoff podcast.
8582740	8583240	When?
8584420	8590340	So I've been talking with Rob and I've been talking with Finara about doing the state
8590340	8597540	of DBD in character hosted by miss Amanda Young, the pig.
8597540	8603460	But there's stuff going on about that.
8603460	8608500	Cause I'm also doing a visual novel style comic sort of thing.
8608500	8610740	That's also kind of in the backend of some stuff.
8611300	8615380	Finara and I have actually been getting like screenshots and some, some stuff playing together.
8616020	8623860	But but that one's going to be the adventures of Amanda and Meg, the secret besties.
8624500	8632820	Um, but, uh, but I think, I think that that's got merit and I need more voice people to be guests.
8635540	8636900	I'll go ahead and just throw it out there.
8636900	8639140	Now it's, it's, it's something I'm working on in the background.
8639140	8640180	Get Tay to do a voice.
8640180	8641860	I think who should Tay voice?
8642580	8643080	Claudette.
8644100	8645700	No, I don't think he should voice Claudette.
8645700	8648180	I'm trying, I think he would definitely be a killer.
8648180	8651620	And I'm trying to think which killer, uh, which killer would Tay be?
8652580	8656340	Probably it's gotta be somebody he really thinks is sweaty and doesn't like.
8657620	8658120	Trickster?
8658820	8660740	No, we need someone actually new.
8660740	8661300	Legion.
8661300	8663460	No, cause I bet you or Finara want to do Legion.
8663460	8664660	No, I was going to do Julie.
8665460	8665940	Bubba.
8665940	8666740	Bubba's a good one.
8666740	8668100	Tay should definitely do Bubba.
8668100	8669140	No, Tay should be Frank.
8670100	8670420	All right.
8670420	8671940	Anyway, Frank and Bubba.
8671940	8673220	You're going to be Frank and Bubba.
8673220	8674260	I'm hiring you.
8674260	8676500	We've made that transition clearly into our-
8676500	8677620	Rob is going to be Nia.
8678180	8681460	We've, we've made that transition clearly into our gaming weeks.
8681620	8684820	So let's talk a little bit about the other games we've been playing this week.
8684820	8688500	Dark Soccer, I don't want to spend an hour on Dead by Daylight, but I did notice you
8688500	8689620	are now playing Survivor.
8689620	8692580	You finally broke the ice in playing Survivor.
8692580	8693460	And I feel like-
8693460	8694580	I got forced into it.
8694580	8698260	I was like, now that you've had your first hit, I feel like you're kind of, I, I feel
8698260	8701780	I'm getting the read, you're kind of into it, but why don't you tell us what's, what's,
8701780	8702900	what's the latest on DVD?
8702900	8703400	Okay.
8703700	8708580	So back in the day, I tried to play Survivor and I hated it.
8708580	8710420	That was at least in the demo.
8710420	8711700	There's video of this.
8712500	8718180	It's on my TikTok of me going around saying, stop healing me.
8718180	8718900	I want to die.
8722260	8730420	So at any rate, I played, I played two games with, for Thirst Trap, the thing that, that
8730420	8731460	Nick and Isaaco do.
8732180	8735380	And one game I think Homotron was in it.
8735380	8740020	And the other one was Anti Vortex, if I want to, if I remember correctly.
8740740	8740980	Nope.
8740980	8741300	Nope.
8741300	8747860	Cosinon was in one and Anti Vortex was in the other, but at any rate, and I had a hundred
8747860	8749060	percent survival rate.
8749060	8750260	They covered my butt.
8750260	8753300	I, I went to the wrong gate both times and just opened it and left.
8754820	8756180	But it was all right.
8756180	8760500	You know, I was, I was screaming the entire time and going, oh shit and fucking stuff
8760500	8760660	up.
8760660	8766900	And, you know, I got hooked exactly once and I was like, okay, I have a hundred percent
8766900	8767700	survival rate.
8767700	8768660	I'm not going to ruin it.
8768660	8769860	No more Survivor.
8770820	8776660	And then the anniversary came out and there was a cosmetic, cause you know, my favorite
8776660	8779620	thing to do with my survivors is to make them a fashion show.
8780420	8783300	Glamour is the end game of any game as a service.
8783940	8787700	That is my whole point for even having survivors is to dress them up pretty.
8788660	8797060	And there's cosmetic came out for Hattie, the new survivor that I needed all of it.
8797060	8798340	It was so cute.
8798340	8799380	I needed it.
8800420	8806660	And so I, I told Venara, look, I have to play Hattie and please play with me.
8806660	8807380	Keep me alive.
8807940	8812020	And Venara has been my backbone, my, my gaming partner.
8812020	8814980	We were, we were, uh, college roommates.
8814980	8818820	I have known Venara more than some of you have been alive.
8820260	8824100	So, um, she's been the Nancy to your Drew, but not literally Nancy.
8824900	8825460	Hmm.
8825460	8826260	I don't know.
8826260	8831140	I'm trying to think of famous, uh, uh, crime fighting duo is in history.
8831140	8833860	The hard is like the, what's your face to my Daria.
8833860	8834180	Okay.
8834180	8836100	Oh, Jane, Jane.
8836100	8837140	She's a Jane to my Daria.
8837700	8845540	Um, but anyway, um, I, I, I played and I was like, okay, I'm just going to start off and
8845540	8848020	do a depths, you know, just adapt the whole time.
8848660	8852820	Um, and I got through a few games and I was like, you know what?
8852820	8854980	This doesn't exactly suck.
8854980	8859140	And the thing is what really cinched it for me.
8859140	8859460	Okay.
8859460	8859780	Yeah.
8859780	8860980	I did Michaela next.
8860980	8861940	I had points in her.
8861940	8862900	I did Claire next.
8862900	8865620	I had points in her because I had wanted, you know, Claire.
8865620	8866580	Cause that was my thing.
8867140	8870580	And I played Meg because I like Meg and Meg was pretty fun.
8870580	8872340	It was like GTFO powers.
8872340	8872740	I'm down.
8873700	8876740	But what cinched it for me was playing Mia.
8879060	8881220	Little sneaky ass ninja girl, Nia.
8881620	8884340	I am an urban evading.
8886260	8888420	You are an urban evasion, Nia.
8888420	8891140	And you are not going to apologize for it.
8891140	8896340	I am an urban evasion, a balanced landing pebble Nia.
8899540	8905700	I tried for the record to use Dead Hard once.
8907140	8908420	I don't like Dead Hard.
8908420	8909220	They're changing that.
8909220	8910020	They're all changing.
8910740	8912340	They're all, all those perks are changing anyway.
8912340	8915140	Well, yeah, but still I figured I'm just going to use it while I can.
8915780	8919620	And booming, I felt completely filthy the whole time on Michaela.
8919620	8927540	So I was like, but sneaking around and throwing the pebble and I have like self-heal on her
8927540	8933300	for right now, just because people have been kind of, but our self-care.
8934180	8938100	But Nia's actually been pretty fun.
8938900	8941620	And I'm kind of digging it, although I'm going to work.
8941620	8943060	I did Claudette as well.
8943620	8944580	It was okay.
8944580	8945300	Little boring.
8945300	8945620	Sorry.
8945620	8947060	I know Tay, Claudette's your girl.
8947060	8950340	It's kind of boring to me, but I'm going to do Fang next.
8952100	8956500	And then I'm probably going to do Cheryl, but I don't know.
8957460	8961540	My Nia is like level 48 right now.
8963060	8965780	And this is me playing her for exactly two days.
8966740	8971380	So, I mean, yeah, we are getting the bonus points and everything, but well, I don't know
8971380	8971620	Tay.
8971620	8972500	I have a, all right.
8972500	8976020	So Tay says, I mean, all survivors are literally just reskins to hold perks, but I don't take
8976020	8976740	it personally.
8976740	8979220	No, some survivors though are loud as fuck and annoying.
8980660	8985380	I don't, my problem with Claudette is that she sounds like a whimpering puppy when she's
8985380	8989860	hurt and I can hear her across any freaking map.
8989860	8996900	And I'm like, if I can hear a Claudette from halfway across the map, they'll be able to
8996900	9001060	hear me or who else is loud and annoying?
9002020	9002500	Yujin?
9003860	9004660	Just a few of them.
9006100	9007540	Jill, Jill's kind of annoying.
9008580	9013300	Nia, however, if she's in crouch mode, you don't hear shit.
9013300	9013860	I love her.
9014420	9017220	She is the Ninja and that, and I have her in a brown outfit with green hair.
9018100	9020340	Just dump me on mother's dwelling and I will hide.
9021780	9025540	But anyway, it all started because of my need for cosmetics.
9026980	9032100	It's Nia, N-E-A, the November Echo Alpha.
9032500	9034020	Did I NATO Alpha that right?
9034020	9034740	Close enough.
9035460	9035860	Yeah.
9035860	9036580	And she's Swedish.
9038980	9045700	But anyway, but anyway, that is, that is what got me into playing survivor and the thing
9046420	9055860	that I actually find fun about it is that because I've played killer so long, I know
9055860	9059540	a lot of tricks that people who only play survivor don't.
9062180	9066900	Now, my problem is that because I have to use this, you know, thumb trackball for ergonomic
9066900	9073940	reasons, I can't look behind me when I run, but I've found it's actually kind of easy
9073940	9074740	to spin people.
9074740	9080100	Like I have a hard time if people try to spin me as killer and my, uh, counteraction to
9080100	9084180	that is that when people start to do the spin, I stop and they run into me and then I stab
9084180	9085380	them in the face and it's awesome.
9086420	9089620	But I was spinning this nurse yesterday.
9089620	9092980	I mean, she was getting me, you know, at other times, but I was getting some good spins on
9092980	9093140	that.
9093140	9094580	And on top of that, I was like, is this Elsie?
9094580	9095620	Cause it was a compo nurse.
9096980	9099780	And then the, um, the weapon was the wrong weapon.
9100980	9102980	And then this person obviously wasn't Elsie.
9102980	9103700	I'll just put it that way.
9103700	9106100	If I could spin her, it wasn't, it wasn't Elsie.
9106100	9106500	No.
9106500	9106900	Yeah.
9106900	9108420	Um, it was a bit at any rate.
9108420	9113300	That was, it was my, uh, aesthetic senses that got me into playing survivor.
9113300	9113780	There you go.
9114420	9116500	And I'm having fun because I'm playing with friends.
9116500	9118340	Now we'll hear from both coasts on Dev I daily.
9118340	9119700	And I love playing with you too, Rob.
9119700	9120660	That was awesome.
9120660	9123780	I joined for a little bit on, I think two of your streams actually.
9123780	9124900	So yeah, you did.
9124900	9125380	You did.
9125380	9131380	Cause I, I, I did, I actually, I was going to do all killer on Thursday and Friday.
9131380	9135940	And then, uh, I did, uh, I ended up doing survivor both of those days.
9135940	9138660	And then I forgot I was streaming last night for some stupid reason.
9138660	9139700	I just wanted your flan.
9141060	9141540	Yeah.
9141540	9145300	But I played two games with, uh, Elsie and company last night.
9146020	9146740	That's fun.
9146740	9148500	And they were playing protect the Sakura.
9149860	9150420	It was cute.
9151300	9154740	Getting involved in the streamer communities and stuff is really, really fun.
9154740	9155140	I think.
9155140	9155380	Yeah.
9156180	9157300	Funara the meat shield.
9158260	9161300	And then, uh, and then Sierra was like, aren't you supposed to be streaming?
9161300	9162820	And I'm like, oh yeah.
9162820	9166180	So I did a bunch of killer matches and help people farm.
9166180	9170260	And just, uh, I was trying to finish getting the community achievement.
9171380	9176180	And I couldn't, because I'm not that good at evasion as survivor yet.
9176180	9177940	I did the chaser one is killer.
9178660	9180420	Um, and that was pretty fun.
9180420	9185940	And I met new people and I made new friends and now I'm 15 followers away from 500.
9186180	9187300	Oh, so close.
9187300	9188180	Get there, get there close.
9188180	9190500	We have some people who haven't visited in a long time tonight.
9190500	9192100	Be sure to drop your Twitch in there.
9192580	9197700	Uh, of course I'll still be playing afterwards and maybe not for my full three hours now,
9197700	9199380	but I might be playing for a little bit after.
9199380	9199940	Yeah.
9199940	9200420	All right.
9200420	9200920	Yeah.
9201700	9202740	I'll shout myself out.
9203940	9205060	Um, let's see.
9205060	9208020	Um, so my gaming week, I'll, I'll just keep it real brief.
9208020	9211700	Um, with the new computer, I've been playing a lot of the same stuff, but it's just so
9211700	9215380	nice to play things like Final Fantasy 14 and it's so smooth.
9215380	9218660	Uh, and, uh, I also play a little dead by daylight as we talked about earlier.
9218660	9221940	And then I've actually been spending a lot of time on Diablo two resurrected.
9221940	9227540	I know like how random, but I did, it was, it was a little, it played okay on my old
9227540	9229300	computer, but on this one, Oh, it's butter.
9229300	9230500	And it looks so good.
9230500	9232340	And the reflections are so nice.
9232340	9235940	And, uh, the whole thing just has me hype for Diablo four, to be honest.
9235940	9237780	I'm not sure I'm going to play much more Diablo two.
9237780	9240740	Cause it's just like, Oh yeah, that old game was really grindy.
9240740	9242580	You had to drop a lot of hours in this game.
9243540	9245780	But, um, it has me hype for Diablo four.
9245780	9248420	And I'm, I'm just excited to see the pretty graphics.
9248420	9250180	I also played no man's sky.
9250180	9251940	What I, um, big shock, right?
9251940	9253700	But here's the pleasant surprise.
9253700	9257780	I've always said that the Microsoft stuff and the things you earn there, you can't use
9257780	9259140	them in the steam version.
9259140	9259940	Well, guess what?
9259940	9264900	If you download the windows game pass version instead, everything transfers over because
9264900	9266340	it's still Xbox.
9266340	9268580	So I can play on PC and keep all my crap.
9268580	9272180	I just have to play in the windows store and I'm totally fine doing that.
9272340	9274340	It really doesn't fucking matter to me what store it's on.
9274340	9275620	I just want to play the game.
9275620	9279940	So I stayed in my steamer, like for dead by daylight, if I can ever get dead by daylight
9279940	9285140	to run on steam, then all of my, uh, achievements and cosmetics will carry over.
9285780	9286180	Oh yeah.
9286180	9286420	Yeah.
9286420	9288020	Cause the, yeah, that's nice for that game.
9288020	9288580	Yeah.
9288580	9290020	So, um, that's it.
9290020	9290660	I'll keep it short.
9290660	9293860	Cause I know we still have like our classic game and stuff, but Loki, I want to get to
9293860	9294180	you too.
9294180	9295140	How was your gaming week?
9295700	9296980	It was Minecraft.
9296980	9297780	Surprise.
9297780	9305700	Um, no, this week we, I started off on the new, actually it was last week, um, on that
9305700	9309300	Saturday started on channel 64, the new SMP that I'm playing on.
9309300	9315380	And so I put out my first episode this week, which is, um, a little bit shorter than I
9315380	9315780	want to.
9315780	9320500	The problem was I did so much in that like first few days that I couldn't really fit
9320500	9321940	what I wanted to include in there.
9321940	9327060	So that's going to be kind of this next episode plus a build, uh, which I'm working on right
9327060	9327700	now.
9327700	9331460	Um, so yeah, it's been, it's been a lot of fun.
9331460	9333220	So I've been really enjoying that.
9333220	9338660	And then as far as other things, there weren't other things as usual.
9339220	9339620	All right.
9340180	9340820	But you got some.
9340820	9341380	Oh no, no, no.
9341380	9341700	I'm sorry.
9341700	9341940	Sorry.
9341940	9342420	Sorry.
9342420	9345220	There was one other thing also Minecraft.
9345220	9353540	Um, so I film what probably will be the last episode of my hardcore series in which I fought
9353540	9359380	the under dragon with about eight to 10 wardens also running around at the same time.
9359940	9360980	So that was fun.
9360980	9363380	So think that'll be coming out.
9363380	9367860	I don't know if I want to continue that series anymore or if I can, you know, I don't want
9367860	9369060	to spoil anything.
9369060	9374100	Um, so that may be the end, but that'll be coming out soon.
9374100	9375380	I just have to edit it down.
9376980	9377380	All right.
9378420	9378820	Okay.
9378820	9383300	Uh, because of all the great questions, our Q and a segment tonight went pretty much took
9383300	9384900	up the entire show, which is fine.
9384900	9388180	I don't, I wouldn't want to spend our 20th show any other way, but we did kind of end
9388180	9389620	up saying, fuck the news.
9389620	9392580	Uh, we will quickly run through the headlines this week.
9392580	9396820	We're going to spend no more than like two sentences on each headline.
9396820	9400180	So our first story, Sony is skipping games com.
9400180	9401700	I don't know if there's a lot more to say than that.
9401700	9403940	Loki, they're not going to be there.
9404980	9406340	Maybe they'll do their own thing.
9406340	9407060	Is it a big deal?
9408420	9411060	Um, I don't know if they have anything in the show.
9411060	9414580	Honestly, I think they might just be saving for their own thing.
9414580	9418180	Um, and I think there'd be a lot of questions about VR too and stuff.
9418180	9423140	I just think, you know, even though many people have decided the pandemic is over, I don't
9423140	9424340	think it really is.
9424340	9425780	And there's a lot of that.
9425780	9429060	That's probably of a concern to Sony as well, where it's like, maybe now just isn't really
9429060	9432580	the time, especially if they want to, if they want to show off a VR headset, the middle
9432580	9434500	of the pandemic is not a great time to do that.
9434500	9436580	So no recession.
9436580	9437080	Yeah.
9437860	9439540	Activision stockholders.
9439860	9444260	I know that, um, Bobby Kotick is still going to be on the board, which has a lot of people
9444260	9447220	saying literally what the fuck is happening.
9447220	9449220	Um, because that's some bullshit.
9449220	9454660	Um, but otherwise there's this weird thing where the stockholders had voted to release
9454660	9459700	the annual harassment reports and the company has said, we'll consider doing that.
9461940	9466580	The stockholders seriously need to revolt and Bobby Kotick needs to be thrown out on
9466580	9468180	his stupid ass.
9468180	9474660	I just, that guy's day of reckoning is long overdue, long overdue, um, dark soccer.
9474660	9478580	This ties into the beginning of the show, but the, um, video game companies talking
9478580	9480020	about the Supreme court ruling.
9480580	9481060	Oh yeah.
9481060	9482180	Bungie blasted them.
9482180	9487940	So many other companies are standing in solidarity and there's a lot of companies out there that
9487940	9493300	are, uh, basically already offering to pay travel expenses for people who have to go
9493300	9496900	out of state for, uh, for their healthcare.
9496900	9497400	Yeah.
9498040	9503640	Uh, Sonic origins ha had, um, it launched, but I guess it's got issues, right?
9503640	9504140	Logie.
9504760	9505080	Yeah.
9505080	9510920	It was developed under a major time crunches and it was also not necessarily perfect when
9510920	9511800	it came out.
9511800	9517800	And according to some of the devs, they were complaining about, um, some of the performance,
9517800	9521720	you know, that they had basically, you know, that their performance under such pressure,
9521720	9526440	but you know, everyone is very unhappy about the state of origins and even the Sonic three
9526440	9527000	component.
9527880	9533720	Um, I know they're like Sonic three, for example, also had like some of the music changed in
9533720	9536440	it because of licensing issues, which this is great.
9536440	9542280	Cause we did get a confirmation from Yuji Naka that Michael Jackson did end up composing
9542280	9543400	music for Sonic three.
9543400	9545240	It was heavily suggested.
9545240	9547640	Now the internet can shut the fuck up about that.
9547640	9548040	God.
9548040	9550600	But like it was legit actually though.
9550600	9551160	It's funny though.
9551160	9556360	Cause there is a video I watched about talking about the, um, comparison by game explain
9556360	9560440	and actually some of the music isn't necessarily from Michael Jackson.
9560440	9568680	One of them is literally like a chip tune version of a, um, actual like song that wasn't
9568680	9569960	by Michael Jackson.
9569960	9574680	So they couldn't include that as well because, you know, you didn't license that song.
9574680	9576680	So oops, oops.
9577560	9578040	All right.
9578760	9579640	Um, let's see.
9579640	9583880	Our next story was that there was a Xenoblade Chronicles three direct this week, uh, from
9583880	9584280	Nintendo.
9584360	9587240	So Nintendo did a direct, but it was all about Xenoblade Chronicles three.
9587240	9590840	And honestly, it just kind of made me think I need to go back and really beat the first
9590840	9591000	game.
9591000	9592040	Cause it was really fun.
9592040	9595480	I played like 10, 15 hours of it, but I never actually beat it because that game can take
9595480	9596680	hundreds of hours.
9596680	9601080	I wasn't as into the second game, but I wonder if it's because I didn't really finish the
9601080	9603800	first one, although the two stories are disconnected.
9603800	9607560	But yeah, I know the people that are really hyped for that series really enjoyed the direct.
9607560	9610200	A lot of different things are planning to do with it, like amiibo support and things
9610200	9610600	like that.
9610600	9612200	So it's going to be a real good summer.
9612200	9616840	If you're a Xenoblade fan, cause there's a whole nother game for you to eat up, uh,
9616840	9619160	dark soccer, you'd reference Stadia earlier in the show.
9620360	9627880	Stadia is hiring right now for, um, an engineering manager, immersive stream for games, Stadia.
9628840	9635080	Um, and basically, uh, they are looking into major projects.
9635080	9640360	So basically wanting someone to major, uh, to lead a team for designers.
9641160	9647480	Um, and then, um, of course there's also that expansion into having Intel compatible games.
9647480	9655480	Um, they're still not leaving the AMD universe, but there's also, uh, as seen in their change
9655480	9660920	log, there's also, uh, uh, evidence that there's going to be a saints row release.
9660920	9667880	Um, and, uh, they're gonna, they're go leading to Stadia 4.18.
9667880	9673720	So there will be different exploration, uh, 1440p and motion controls.
9675080	9679000	So long story short Stadia is not as dead as a lot of people seem to think it is.
9679000	9680440	They're still expanding.
9680440	9680940	Yup.
9681560	9686760	Uh, Loki, I talked about this game earlier, Pokemon go and we're debating it again, right?
9687480	9691960	It's it's, it's just more of the same stuff we've been hearing for a while now about how
9691960	9699320	Niantic keeps pulling back different things that they had put in place during the pandemic
9699320	9701240	that people kind of got accustomed to.
9701240	9706600	And now, um, you know, especially like with remote rating, um, they stopped giving out
9706600	9713320	the free, uh, weekly one, uh, coin remote rate pass, um, that was available.
9713320	9719080	And then now they've chart or they're upping the cost of the three remote rate passes.
9719080	9725080	So now that's instead of, you know, paying 250 where you get like a 50 coin discount
9725080	9732040	for buying three, uh, it is now just 100 coins each pass, which is kind of annoying.
9732040	9736680	Plus they also decided that half the length of the community day from the six to three
9736680	9740120	hours, uh, from 11 AM to 2 PM only.
9741240	9747880	So, and they're saying that there's, was it the ability to ask or that players are also
9747880	9752760	going to be able to extend the day past 2 PM by taking part in a new type of gym.
9752760	9756280	That was the whole real new thing that they did with this community day, which I didn't
9756280	9757240	care for.
9757240	9759720	Um, this part, because Mike Deaf says this is old news.
9759720	9763480	Yeah, the, the, the recapping going on this week is kind of encompassing both what happened
9763480	9767480	before and what they did with this community day, which they made some changes and it made
9767480	9770520	the evolved form of dino spawn more often.
9770520	9771800	I did community day.
9771800	9772840	It was hot out.
9772840	9774200	I did not have a good time.
9774200	9778040	I caught my three shinies and I was done and it was a lot harder to catch shinies cause
9778040	9780360	that stupid evolved zelius or whatever.
9780360	9784280	Well, it was nice to, I understand people wanted it for the exile candy, but those things
9784280	9786440	can't be shiny and it was silly.
9786440	9790920	And then the raid thing, it was like, I'm not, I can't, the, the problem with Niantic's
9790920	9793400	thinking about, we're going to get out everybody in person.
9793400	9797960	Well, when they limit it to certain timeframes and stuff, it was a hundred degrees here.
9797960	9799400	No, I'm not doing that.
9799480	9804840	So it was just, I, there's still a lot of, a lot of kinks to be worked out.
9804840	9805880	That's for sure.
9805880	9808760	And that's the weather isn't all like the Bay area.
9808760	9809480	Exactly.
9809480	9813080	Everywhere in the country, in the ferry building where Niantic's located.
9813080	9813400	All right.
9813400	9814840	Anyway, uh, moving on.
9815720	9819720	Halo master chief collection is looking at adding microtransactions, which is surprising
9819720	9823400	is that game is eight years old, but, um, I kind of go, you know what?
9823400	9827320	Mario Kart eight is also that old and they're still releasing DLC.
9827320	9828360	So you know what?
9828360	9832440	If they want to extend the life of that game, just make the microtransactions have value.
9832440	9835240	I'm not sure if it's silly cosmetics, it'll have value, but
9836920	9842120	Halo master chief collection is kind of like the Wii sports of game pass.
9842920	9846360	And I feel like even though, yes, that game is eight years old, it's like that greatest
9846360	9847560	hits collection.
9847560	9849240	It's like Abba gold.
9849240	9852920	It's a CD that's going to sell for years and years and years and years.
9852920	9854360	Cause it's just the classics.
9854360	9855960	And I think that's kind of where Halo master chief.
9855960	9859160	But I don't think this is, I don't think this is like that though, because they're
9859160	9864280	adding an in game currency, which it's because they want to do a battle pass.
9864280	9865480	I'm sure with the multiplayer.
9865480	9865640	Yeah.
9865640	9870440	But like you could just sell that stuff for like real money.
9870440	9871400	Like you just buy it.
9871400	9873160	You don't have to buy an in game current.
9873160	9873880	I mean, I get it.
9873880	9875720	They want to turn it into a live service.
9875720	9878600	Maybe because Halo Infinite's not working as well for them.
9878600	9879080	I don't know.
9879080	9880920	Or maybe they just double dip that stuff.
9880920	9883560	But, um, yeah, I don't like it.
9884440	9885720	Do do something else.
9885720	9889320	Like if you're going to do that, or like, you know, the master chief collection is not
9889320	9892440	free, you know, make, make it free then.
9892440	9894280	No, but it is, it is a game pass.
9894280	9897880	And I think a lot of people are, are which, but I know game pass is free.
9897880	9902120	I'm just saying, I think they're loading it a little bit because they know this is like
9902120	9903400	a go-to staple.
9903400	9905000	Many people install with game pass.
9905720	9907080	Sort of my thought on that.
9907080	9909320	Just, you know, vote with your wallet.
9909320	9909800	That's right.
9909800	9911240	Vote with your wallet at the end of the day.
9912120	9912680	All right.
9912680	9916600	Well, now we're going to, in our next segment, take a trip down memory lane to a game that
9916600	9921560	is way too old for them to patch with microtransactions.
9921560	9924040	And I'm sure many of you are very curious.
9924040	9925480	What did Jamie pick?
9925480	9926920	20 year old show tonight.
9926920	9929320	Let's go roll the bumper.
9929320	9945240	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
9945240	9947560	out a classic and tell you about it.
9947560	9950200	It's time for the classic game of the week.
9951240	9956120	And I have to admit, I'm only a little surprised at this pick because I thought, oh, she'll
9956120	9959960	do like Bamani DDR or something, but you went kind of a different direction.
9959960	9965400	You were like, I'm going to pick a classic bold, underlined, italic.
9965400	9974280	Like this game is how we have many other, many other games, a genre of games, but dark
9974280	9975320	soccer, I will say no more.
9975880	9978200	What did you pick for the classic game of the week?
9979080	9980200	I picked asteroids.
9981480	9982760	We're going old school with this.
9983720	9988360	So Asteroids is a multi-directional shooting game.
9988360	9991800	It was designed by Lyle Rains and Ed Log.
9991800	9998680	It was released in arcades in North America, November, 1979 by Atari.
9999560	10006200	You are a spaceship in an asteroid field, you have some flying saucers go by, but you
10006200	10011320	have to shoot and destroy the asteroids and the saucers while not colliding into either
10011560	10013320	or being hit in the crossfire.
10013880	10017480	And the game, of course, gets harder as you go.
10018120	10023720	This is considered to be one of the very first from the golden age of arcade games.
10024360	10028200	It sold over 70,000 arcade cabinets.
10029400	10032680	And it's been a hyper influential over the decades.
10035000	10039800	And I would actually fifth dream says this is No Man's Sky Zero, right?
10039800	10043800	I'd say actually, probably without this one, we wouldn't have No Man's Sky.
10043800	10045080	We wouldn't have a lot of games.
10046040	10052840	And indeed, this game was considered to be a direct influencer of Defender and Gravatar
10053480	10054440	and a few other games.
10055080	10063000	So Asteroids was, they came up with it when Log and Rains used some of the hardware that
10063000	10070680	was developed by Howard Delman that had been used on Lunar Lander to make a game and they
10070680	10075400	based it off an unfinished game called Cosmos using its physics model, the control scheme
10075960	10081400	and gameplay elements that also were from Spacewar!, Computer Space and Space Invaders
10081400	10082360	and they refined it.
10083640	10090840	The game is rendered on a vector display with a two dimensional view that wraps around both
10090840	10091640	screen axes.
10092600	10100200	So going into this, this is also one of those games that taught us how to exploit some of
10100200	10104920	the code in it because there's what's called a lurking exploit.
10106040	10111800	So basically, the saucers were supposed to begin shooting when they appeared and it got
10111800	10112200	changed.
10112200	10116600	And additionally, they could only aim at the player ship on screen and they are not able
10116600	10119000	to see beyond the game boundaries.
10119080	10125720	So you could lurk near the edge of the screen opposite the saucer and so basically it couldn't
10125720	10126200	shoot you.
10127080	10137240	They did put out, they have Atari patched the game, they patched the EPROM and removed the
10137240	10137800	exploits.
10137800	10140520	So here's also an early example of game patches.
10141080	10153640	But going back to the design of the game, basically, Log was really impressed with the
10154760	10160200	Atari video computer system, which was retitled to the Atari 2600.
10160200	10163800	And so he joined Atari's co-op division to work on Dirtbike.
10163800	10165160	It's a game that never came out.
10165240	10170120	It had an unsuccessful field test, also joined by Paul Mancuso.
10171480	10177720	He was on the development team as the asteroid's technician and engineer Howard Delman also
10179320	10180280	worked on the hardware.
10181160	10189960	And so the other fella in this reigns discussed a game called Planet Grab, which is a multiplayer
10189960	10192680	arcade game that was renamed to Cosmos.
10195560	10206440	And basically it went from there and so basically it just ended up, well, actually the game
10206440	10211320	Cosmos that they had in its unfinished version, it had a giant indestructible asteroid.
10211320	10216040	And so Reigns asked Log, well, why don't we have a game where you shoot the rocks and
10216040	10216840	blow them up?
10217640	10219000	And so the concept was born.
10220760	10222680	It was developed as a vector game.
10223640	10228280	So, of course, the lines are all drawn, the graphics are all drawn on a vector monitor.
10230200	10235160	Although Reigns originally wanted it to be done in raster graphics, but Log wanted Vector
10236200	10240520	because it would allow more precise aiming and a higher quality image.
10240520	10254680	And so it's a modified MOS 6502 and QuadraScan, which is the high res vector processor that
10254680	10256120	Atari developed.
10256120	10258760	And it's referred to as an XY display system.
10258760	10262760	The digital vector generator is the other term.
10263880	10270120	So at any rate, they all came out of science and engineering, which was Atari's off campus
10270120	10273320	research lab in Grass Valley, which is not far from us.
10274520	10274920	Oh, wow.
10274920	10276520	I didn't realize it was there.
10276520	10277080	That's cool.
10277720	10278040	Yeah.
10279000	10281560	And of course, that design was first used on Lunar Lander.
10282600	10293240	So the modified board had five buttons, 13 sound effects and additional RAM, and it was
10293240	10294600	used to develop asteroids.
10295160	10298920	The board itself is four by four inches linked up to a monitor.
10300760	10311880	So eventually, the prototype, once it existed, different members of the Atari staff, engineers
10311880	10314840	would just walk between labs and stop and play the game.
10315640	10320120	And people just were getting into it.
10320120	10325320	So Atari tested the game first in arcades.
10325320	10326120	Guess where, Rob?
10328040	10329000	Also near here?
10329000	10329880	Like here in Zach?
10329880	10330920	Sacramento.
10330920	10332040	Wow, cool.
10333240	10334680	There's a reason why I brought this up.
10336120	10338840	And they would basically watch people while they play it.
10341640	10344600	Players were...
10344600	10348200	I made a complaint they didn't get too much of a break in the game, especially those who
10348200	10349560	were used to Space Invaders.
10350360	10358440	But what they did is they ended up just making little adjustments to the game.
10358440	10362920	So Atari will slow down as you gain 50 to 100 lives.
10363480	10366040	But there's no limit on the lives you display.
10366040	10370360	You can lose the game if more than 250 lives are collected.
10371640	10373800	So let's get on to the home versions.
10374680	10380520	Asteroids was released for the Atari VCS, AKA the Atari 2600, and the Atari 8-bit family
10380520	10382680	of computers in 1981.
10383400	10388440	And then the Atari 7800 in 1986.
10388440	10390760	There was a port for the 5200.
10390760	10392840	It was supposed to be just like the 8-bit version.
10393880	10396040	It was developed in 82 and not published.
10396040	10399640	And I do believe that we have a prototype of it.
10399640	10400280	One of the...
10400280	10401400	We released prototypes.
10402440	10404440	I mean, we've got two Atari 5200s.
10405000	10410280	The 7800 version was a launch title and had co-op play.
10410280	10415480	And Asteroids had colorful textures, but they did keep the heartbeat sound from the original.
10416280	10428280	And basically, though, the programmers who had to get it onto a 4 kilobyte cartridge
10430040	10430520	started...
10431880	10436520	When they worked on it, they basically made this game the first console to use bank switching.
10437080	10441880	So a technique that basically switches a ROM size from 4 kilobytes to 8 kilobytes.
10442840	10445000	This game was ridiculously popular.
10445000	10455000	It displaced space invaders, had 70,000 units, earned about 150 million in sales from the game,
10455640	10459160	and a further 500 million in coin drops.
10459320	10468360	Basically, because it had been based on the Lunar Lander vector thing,
10468360	10470360	it actually shipped in Lunar Lander cabinets.
10471560	10479240	And then they had to put larger coin boxes in the games to accommodate all the people
10480200	10482520	who were spending money on it.
10483000	10494680	It was the highest ranking game on the US replay amusement arcade charts in 1980.
10496760	10502280	And it became the highest grossing arcade video game of 1980 in the US after space invaders.
10504600	10507080	Now, here's the side thing, though.
10508280	10509720	Actually, let me go back a little bit more.
10510680	10520280	They did an asteroid deluxe unit that also did fairly well,
10520280	10525720	but it was a failure in Japan when it was released in 1980 because of the complex controls.
10526280	10529800	And the Japanese market was losing interest in space shooters at the time.
10530440	10533960	I mean, I think they just came out of the whole space invaders
10535000	10537480	huge craze that was causing the yen shortage.
10540680	10545720	But at any rate, it got really good ratings.
10545720	10546920	It was really fun.
10548360	10553240	It was one of the first games that tracked your initials and allow you to put in your high score.
10555240	10557320	It was praised for its vector graphics.
10558200	10564600	It was, in 1996, Next Generation listed as number 39 of their top 100 games of all years.
10564600	10567480	Retro Gamer put it in the top 25.
10568440	10572840	It was added to the Museum of Modern Art's collection of video games.
10573800	10578520	The Guardian listed Asteroids as the second greatest game of 1970, just below Galaxian.
10579720	10587560	And I mean, it's just got like all kinds of just accolades.
10587560	10595880	And also in Saturday Night Live, the characters of Mr. Bill and Sluggo were
10598440	10604600	they were referring to the saucers in an Esquire article.
10605240	10612840	And so, Lug got a cease and desist letters from a lawyer with the Mr. Bill trademark.
10613720	10614760	Very, very silly.
10616680	10618440	There were sequels.
10618440	10625800	1981, our Asteroids Deluxe came out and the enhancements were made by Dave Shepard
10625800	10627320	with Outlog's involvement.
10628360	10633080	The objects were tinted blue, hyperspace replaced by a shield that depletes.
10634040	10637080	There's a killer satellite, had a holographic backdrop.
10638120	10640040	And then after that, there was Space Duel,
10641320	10646600	where the rocks were colorful geometric shapes and had co-op two player.
10646600	10652280	And then a game that I have covered for a classic game was Blasteroids in 1987.
10652280	10657080	They had branching levels and bosses and docking your ships and multiplayer.
10658520	10660600	And it was raster graphics instead of vector.
10661240	10665720	So for re-releases on the Lynx, we had Super Asteroids and Missile Command.
10666680	10671880	Activision released it for many different series in their collections.
10673400	10676200	Crave did Asteroids Hyper 64.
10678360	10681320	There was a version for by, I think, for the Jaguar.
10682680	10687080	Just so many different like game room versions and mobile phone versions
10687080	10693560	and just all kinds that are a little bit too many to mention.
10693560	10699960	And then we had the clones because back in the day, it was all about send in the clones.
10701640	10704520	Quality Software did Asteroids in Space for the Apple II.
10706360	10709800	There were Appleoids was another one.
10709880	10713160	Mindstorm for the Vetrex, Acornsoft's meteors.
10713160	10714840	Moons of Jupiter for the VIC-20.
10715800	10719800	Planetoids for the TRS-80.
10721240	10724280	Meteor Storm for the Sinclair Zetec Spectrum.
10725080	10731000	And another very bad Asteroids clone for the VIC-20 was out there.
10731000	10734280	There's also a Mattel Intellivision game meteor
10734280	10739160	that was canceled due to a lawsuit for Asteroids and was reworked as Astro Smash.
10740200	10742360	Um, world records.
10743480	10744600	Yeah, Twin Galaxies.
10744600	10746360	And I'm not going to go with Twin Galaxies, so whatever.
10747480	10753080	But I mean, think of all the other games that have come out that are kind of based on that.
10753080	10756600	I would wager like Geometry Wars, you know?
10756600	10757100	Oh, yeah.
10757960	10764920	And you know, one of my favorite games ever of on the ColecoVision is Space Fury.
10764920	10770600	One would argue that Space Fury was based off of Asteroids.
10770600	10773000	I would say it's definitely based off Asteroids.
10773000	10773500	Yep.
10775640	10778360	Just all kinds of games like that, you know?
10778360	10789480	And like I was saying, this one paved the way for generations of space motion games, I would say.
10790440	10799080	You know, I think without Asteroids, it was the next big thing to push the industry.
10799080	10803000	And on top of that, again, it led to very, uh, you know, innovations that we take for
10803000	10805400	granted today, like being able to put in your high score.
10806120	10807160	That was Asteroids.
10809000	10813000	So, uh, I'm claiming that for Classic Game and I'm sticking to it.
10813000	10815880	No, great pick for the Classic Game of the Week here on our
10816520	10821960	20th anniversary show, episode number 920, Asteroids, which many people in chat are kind
10821960	10825080	of lighting up saying, this is the first video game I remember playing.
10825640	10828680	So it's definitely, definitely a classic in that regard.
10829480	10830040	All right.
10830040	10840120	I, um, there is somewhere with a picture of me like four years old in like 1980 playing
10840120	10843160	an asteroid standing on a stool somewhere out there.
10843800	10847560	There's, there's a picture of me like that, but Crystal Castles is the game.
10849080	10849560	Yeah.
10849560	10849960	All right.
10851080	10852520	We're going to skip a couple of segments here.
10852520	10855560	We're going to skip our rapid fire news and our world release dates.
10855560	10859560	And we're just going to rip, uh, Bernie Stiller.
10860120	10860360	Yes.
10860360	10860600	Sorry.
10860600	10862120	I forgot that was in rapid fire news tonight.
10862680	10866920	Um, let's take a look at the, uh, last few headlines here.
10866920	10868440	I think Loki, this first one was yours.
10869160	10869720	Yep.
10869720	10874440	So, uh, the X cloud stuff is getting mouse and keyboard support, which is pretty nice.
10875400	10877000	So that's the thing.
10877000	10877160	Yeah.
10877160	10878120	I'm excited to try that.
10878120	10878620	That'd be great.
10879320	10879720	Yeah.
10879720	10881000	Uh, dark Sakura.
10881000	10885240	I don't know if you can make this one short, but a study on child intelligence involving
10885240	10885740	games.
10886760	10891880	Um, basically a video games can boost child's intelligent TV and social media had no, uh,
10892520	10893960	effects in this way.
10893960	10898440	Um, and intelligence is not a constant.
10899080	10906360	So it has to be, uh, judged in situational areas and ongoing for it to have a solid measure
10906360	10906680	of it.
10906680	10909400	So this, uh, study has been going on for a while.
10910520	10914040	Uh, Loki, this next one, this is kind of something I want to download and try.
10914760	10915240	Yeah.
10915240	10917560	Unfortunately, you're probably not going to be able to do that unless you have a modded
10917560	10924200	switch system, but, um, some, some crafty modders have made super Mario Odyssey multiplayer.
10925000	10932840	Um, and it is a 10 player mod that works on modded consoles, allows you to play with a
10932840	10933720	bunch of people.
10933720	10936600	You can all, um, it's all synced together.
10936600	10942040	You can collect moons together and, uh, lots of different custom game modes.
10942680	10944280	Nintendo will shut it down immediately.
10944840	10949000	This is really something that they should implement in the actual super Mario Odyssey
10949000	10950760	game, but they'll never do it.
10951720	10955240	No, not at this point, but you know, if rumors are true that they're working on a Luigi
10955240	10960520	Odyssey or some type of super Mario Odyssey to, you know, listen up clearly fans want
10960520	10961000	this, right?
10961720	10963080	Yeah, it'd be pretty cool.
10963080	10967320	Um, the last story, there was a lot of, uh, press things going around about Final Fantasy
10967320	10968680	16, this week's new interviews.
10968680	10972520	And one of them was confirmed that, um, Final Fantasy 16 will not be open world.
10972520	10974840	Um, but honestly, I don't think that's that big of a deal.
10974840	10979800	The only one that was open world was 15 and a lot of people didn't care for 15.
10979800	10984520	Um, and you know, if you look at 14, you know, for being in an MMO, it takes place
10984520	10986040	in segmented zones.
10986040	10988920	And that sounds a lot like what they have planned for 16.
10988920	10993640	And at the end of the day, honest to God, creative business unit three fixed Final
10993640	10998120	Fantasy 14 and made it one of the greatest games out there right now, especially in the
10998120	10998840	MMO space.
10999640	11001400	I'm just going to trust them.
11001400	11005720	If this is their creative decision for 16, if they've changed the combat so that you
11005720	11009000	only play one person and you do have a party, but you don't really use them.
11009000	11009240	All right.
11009240	11009640	You know what?
11010200	11011240	I'm going to just hear it out.
11011240	11015000	I'm going to, I'm going to see what they bring to the table because, you know, 14 was so
11015000	11015720	good.
11015720	11020600	I'm, I'm willing to give it a chance, but I'm just to see, say the bar, the bar is very
11020600	11020840	high.
11021720	11026280	Um, we are past the three hour mark tonight, so I'm going to beg that we roll over the,
11026280	11029320	um, Twitter and mailbag stuff to next week.
11029320	11036520	I will just say big, big thank you to, um, everybody who sent stuff in.
11036520	11038200	Uh, I saw the tweets.
11038200	11041720	A lot of you were very lovely on Twitter today, and I want to thank you for that.
11042520	11045560	I didn't even consider that there were people that wanted to call in tonight.
11045560	11046200	Of course they do.
11046200	11048200	It's the 20th year and we always do Collins.
11048200	11051400	I'm going to, I'm going to do the two minute rule tonight.
11051400	11053160	We're doing quick phone calls tonight.
11053160	11056200	So you got to introduce yourself and say what you got to say.
11056200	11057480	So here we go.
11057480	11058920	I'm going to start bringing people in.
11058920	11064200	If you want to call in vognetwork.com and slash discord, excuse me, vognetwork.com
11064200	11068120	slash discord, and then you can join the green room.
11068200	11071400	We'll bring in our first contestant tonight.
11071400	11071800	Hi there.
11071800	11072760	You're on orange launch radio.
11072760	11073240	Who's this?
11076680	11077400	Hello there.
11077400	11079640	I don't know if you know, I just brought you in the room, but hi, you're on orange
11079640	11080040	launch radio.
11080040	11080520	Who's this?
11083160	11083640	Okay.
11083640	11084520	Oh, Nope.
11084520	11085000	They left.
11085000	11086760	So we'll try bringing in someone else.
11086760	11087800	Let's try another contestant.
11087800	11088760	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
11088760	11089240	Who's this?
11089960	11091400	This is Brad from pod culture.
11091400	11092920	Hey, Brad from pod culture.
11092920	11095800	It's great to hear from you the two minute rules in effect tonight.
11095800	11097320	So what's on your mind real quick?
11098840	11101960	Just calling to say congratulations on 20, man.
11101960	11102920	Thank you so much.
11102920	11105560	And I know pod culture was a show.
11105560	11108040	You're named after a show that you had for a very long time.
11108920	11113960	That was no small spring chicken itself.
11113960	11114520	You know what I mean?
11114520	11118120	It had a great life.
11118120	11119080	I miss it, my friend.
11121320	11127480	Let's just say that well, OLR inspired kind of the early days of pod culture, and that's
11127480	11128360	why I was calling in.
11128360	11133080	It's you guys were a huge influence on how we set up the feel of our shows.
11133080	11137000	Just three or four friends sitting around shooting the shit about stuff that they like.
11139720	11146680	Let's just say there might be something in the works where we can all record virtually.
11146680	11148360	I will look forward to it.
11148360	11148760	Good luck.
11148760	11149320	Pod culture.
11149320	11150360	We'll look forward to seeing it.
11150360	11151240	Have a good one, my friend.
11151800	11152920	Happy anniversary, guys.
11152920	11153880	Thank you.
11153880	11155160	Thanks for being here all these years.
11155160	11155640	All right.
11155640	11156040	Bye bye.
11156040	11156280	Bye.
11156760	11157000	All right.
11157000	11160760	Let's try to bring you one more real quick, and we'll see if this works this time.
11160760	11161720	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11161720	11162220	Who's this?
11163960	11169000	I think it's actually working this time because Discord decided to mute me when I had everything
11169000	11169640	all set.
11169640	11170840	I mean, what the heck?
11170840	11171080	All right.
11171080	11172440	Well, the two minute rules in effect tonight.
11172440	11173560	So what's on your mind, my friend?
11173560	11176360	And it's great to hear and see you DJ Rama S.
11176360	11177000	I love your shirt.
11177640	11177880	All right.
11177880	11178280	Thank you.
11178280	11181880	I decided to wear this as an honor for 20 amazing years.
11182760	11183720	It's perfect.
11183720	11184200	I love it.
11185160	11190120	So I'm bringing back our tradition, and I'll make this as quick as possible.
11190120	11194280	So I have the first one for Loki.
11194280	11194780	I do it.
11195720	11201960	The straight man, the voice of reason, the angriest SOB when it comes to gaming.
11201960	11205880	So when he gets mad, you sit down, you shut up, and you listen.
11207400	11209400	And by the way, Ron must take it a shot.
11209400	11211400	And Bobby does have a good point.
11211400	11213160	If you're audio only, we don't know what's on the shirt.
11213240	11214280	What is on the shirt tonight?
11214280	11215720	It's like Sailor Moon fighting.
11216440	11216760	Yeah.
11216760	11219080	So we all know Marvel versus Capcom.
11219080	11221960	And what's popular are these cool types of T shirts.
11221960	11226840	This one is a parody of the Marvel versus Capcom fighting select screen, but it's all
11226840	11231400	the classic anime series from the 90s and 2000s.
11231400	11237960	So currently on my shirt, you have Kenshin Himuro from Rurouni Kenshin and Sailor Moon
11237960	11241080	going up against Hikaru from Magic Knight Ray Earth.
11241080	11243720	And Yusuke Urameshi from Yu Yu Hockey Show.
11243720	11244280	I'd love it.
11246280	11249560	We do still call that out in my house from time to time.
11249560	11251800	You'll hear Dan just randomly call that out.
11252840	11253340	Oh, yeah?
11253960	11255400	Because I'm sorry.
11256920	11257160	Great.
11257160	11257880	Now I can't think of.
11259720	11260680	Quabra?
11260680	11261180	Yeah.
11261640	11262280	That was his guy.
11263240	11265400	I always have trouble trying to pronounce his name too.
11266040	11268680	No, I couldn't remember his name off the top of my head.
11268680	11274360	I was like, something like I'm having my two minute rule.
11274360	11276040	And Rama's got some more toast to do.
11276040	11276680	I'm sorry.
11276680	11277560	I have to be that guy.
11277560	11281800	But we're long to this one for Jamie Dark Sakura.
11281800	11284680	And I say this in the most lovingly way of possible.
11284680	11286280	The head bitch in charge.
11286280	11289560	When you hear her talk, if you don't listen, that's your ass.
11291400	11292120	Love you bestie.
11292760	11293260	Salut.
11294760	11295260	L'chaim.
11296040	11296540	L'chaim.
11297320	11302280	And to Rob, the sassiest motherfucker I have ever met.
11303400	11303900	Thank you.
11304760	11306840	When you speak, we listen.
11307880	11311400	Because the show has become, we just come out and hang out
11311400	11313720	and we talk and we have a damn good time.
11313720	11317160	So Rob, thanks for everything.
11317160	11319320	The fish, the whole nine yards.
11319320	11321080	And I remember having a cup like that.
11322120	11322760	I adore you.
11324360	11325000	The last one.
11325880	11326920	Oh, please trust.
11327480	11328360	Here's to you.
11328360	11329080	Here's to me.
11329080	11330600	The best of friends will ever be.
11330600	11332120	If we should ever happen to disagree.
11332120	11333320	Well, then fuck you.
11333320	11333880	And here's to me.
11337000	11340120	And now I must bid adieu because I have to get up at 7 a.m.
11340120	11340600	For work.
11340600	11342360	So good night, Joe.
11342360	11343160	Good night, Rama.
11343880	11344600	Party without you.
11346120	11348920	Anime Jam session, Tuesday nights, 9 p.m.
11348920	11349320	Eastern.
11349320	11349880	See you then.
11349880	11350380	Bye.
11350760	11351260	Bye.
11351260	11351880	I love this.
11351880	11352200	All right.
11352760	11356040	Let's just to play the music like the Oscars.
11356040	11356920	Pull in a few more.
11356920	11357320	Yeah, I know.
11357320	11357560	Right.
11357560	11360600	Swell the music up as we give people the hook.
11360600	11361800	Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio.
11361800	11362280	Who's this?
11363400	11364760	Hey, this is Mike Deft.
11364760	11365560	Mike Deft.
11365560	11366440	It's good to hear from you.
11367560	11369960	As you know, the two minute rules in effect tonight.
11369960	11372200	But it's great to hear what's on your mind.
11372200	11373480	I'm going to keep it short.
11373480	11377480	And again, I want to thank you or congratulate you first
11377480	11379400	for the 20th anniversary.
11380040	11388600	And also thank you, each one of you, because, yeah, it's been an amazing 20 years for you.
11389480	11394360	I'm obviously haven't been 20 years here, but something I said earlier.
11394360	11395880	It feels like you've been here since the beginning.
11395880	11397400	But I mean that as a compliment.
11397400	11397880	I hope you know.
11398520	11398760	Yeah.
11399400	11405240	But something I said in chat earlier that the best compliment you can get is basically
11406200	11410920	the inspiration you set on other people to do their own thing.
11411720	11421000	And I really want to emphasize in that, that if your grandma is doing his podcast,
11421000	11425960	if I'm doing my podcast, so many people who have inspired over the years.
11425960	11429480	And I'm really thankful for being part of our lives.
11430120	11431640	Like, it's been amazing.
11431640	11438360	And hopefully you can keep doing this at least for a long time, or at least a few years more.
11438360	11442040	And again, thanks so much for all you do.
11442760	11443800	Thank you so much.
11443800	11446920	It truly is the greatest compliment.
11446920	11449160	And I said, I'm not going to cry tonight.
11449160	11450440	I'm not going to do it.
11450440	11452120	But thank you so much for that.
11452120	11453160	We can cry, Rob.
11453160	11454760	I know, but I'm not going to.
11456680	11458040	Do you have no tears left to cry?
11458040	11461400	No, by the way, who also shares my birthday today?
11462200	11462280	Ariana Grande.
11462280	11462920	Thank you very much.
11462920	11463960	I'm so honored.
11463960	11464280	All right.
11464280	11465800	I have Tim Curry, though.
11465800	11467720	Deft with the GFM cast.
11467720	11470600	Or should I say, hey, F-A-M-A cast, right?
11470600	11471000	I say that right.
11471000	11472200	Hey, F-A-M-A cast.
11472200	11472600	Awesome.
11473080	11473720	All right.
11473720	11474120	Enjoy.
11474680	11476520	It's all in Spanish, though.
11476520	11478920	So it helps to be able to speak the language.
11478920	11484600	I would love to come on your show if I could hang with the language, but I could do a bumper.
11484600	11486360	I got Google Translate.
11488120	11488440	All right.
11489080	11489960	That would be awesome.
11489960	11490280	All right.
11490280	11490920	Take care, Deft.
11491000	11491720	It's great to hear from you.
11492680	11493160	Thanks.
11493160	11493400	All right.
11493400	11493900	Bye-bye.
11494920	11495560	All right.
11495560	11496520	We got a couple more.
11496520	11497160	Last chance.
11497160	11499400	Get you a butt in the green room if you want to call in.
11499400	11501080	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
11501080	11501580	Who's this?
11502760	11503880	Hey, this is YYR.
11503880	11505080	Hey, YYR.
11505080	11506280	It's good to hear from you.
11506280	11506760	What's up?
11506760	11507160	I'm sorry.
11507160	11509160	The two-minute rule is in effect tonight, though.
11509160	11510280	Oh, that is just fine.
11510280	11512680	I know this is difficult, but you have to keep it short.
11512680	11513960	What's on your mind?
11513960	11514600	I do.
11514600	11515400	I will.
11515400	11518520	Listen, first, I just want to say.
11518520	11519020	Right.
11519480	11524360	Congratulations on 20 years, and I just want to also say thank you.
11525400	11532520	I had no idea that when this, you know, a friend of mine named Matt, who you all know as SSJ100Matt,
11533320	11539960	told me about this podcast all the way back in 2008 and said, hey, you know, maybe you
11539960	11542680	could plug your game Snake 360 on there.
11542680	11547960	I had no idea that this would be the start of a beautiful relationship and also just,
11547960	11552040	you know, it's entertaining to listen to you guys week in and week out.
11552040	11553080	So thank you.
11553080	11554440	I really appreciate that.
11555800	11560840	But actually, I just wanted to mention, because, you know, a few of the things that have been
11560840	11564520	said on the show have led to me creating games.
11565880	11572600	And a few times, I've heard something, and my immediate reaction was, I have to do that.
11573240	11580360	There is one outstanding moment on this show that I had that reaction to that I have not
11580360	11584600	been able to make good on yet, and I figured, hopefully, it'll come through my mic.
11584600	11586600	I would like to go ahead and play it.
11587480	11593640	It is way back from episode 775 that took place in 2019.
11594600	11602840	This part immediately happened after, Rob, you introduced a story about Platinum Games,
11602840	11607560	and they were mentioning that they had a couple of projects in development that were too early
11607560	11613320	to announce, but they promised they were like nothing that had ever come before, to which
11613320	11614440	Loki replied,
11644120	11649400	Please, please do not say you are surprise announcing Wrecked Gun here on the show.
11650600	11655320	I have nothing to announce yet, but I promise it will be like nothing you've ever seen before.
11657480	11658520	Or want to see.
11661800	11666200	And with that, I say congratulations once again, and I will bid you adieu.
11667080	11672440	You make dreams a reality here at Orange Launch Radio, and I really can't thank you enough,
11673080	11680200	even though I'm really about to cuss you out, so I'm going to let you go.
11681880	11683800	Have a great night and a great week.
11683800	11684280	Take care.
11684280	11687480	At least it's not like Gatling cock or something.
11688040	11689000	Oh my God.
11690200	11694040	We said that on episode 775, and that man remembered.
11694040	11699880	Do not blow it out your ass.
11699880	11700380	Literally.
11702040	11703720	I see it's a very correct.
11704680	11706600	Okay, we still have a couple more calls.
11706600	11707640	Let's get you and I love it.
11707640	11710040	These are names I don't get to see very often, so let's do it.
11710040	11711480	Let's bring in another caller.
11711480	11713000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11713000	11713500	Who's this?
11717080	11719160	Oh, oh, hi.
11719160	11720280	Hi, it's Orange, right?
11720280	11720760	You're here.
11720760	11721720	Hey, Orange, right?
11721720	11722840	It's good to hear from you.
11722840	11724440	I don't think we hear from you a lot.
11726600	11727240	Sorry about that.
11728040	11729400	No, I know it's very jarring.
11729400	11730280	It's like you're sitting in a room.
11731400	11732120	This kind of thing.
11733560	11739800	I'm watching the Twitch feed and the Discord at the same time, so it's all good.
11739800	11740360	All good.
11740360	11741960	Well, what is on your mind tonight, my friend?
11741960	11745160	Unfortunately, the two minute rules in effect tonight, so I got to keep it quick.
11745160	11745660	What's up?
11746520	11746840	All right.
11746840	11752040	I just wanted to I wish I came in with a real question, but I just wanted to say congratulations
11752040	11759240	on the 20 years and thank you for making my Sunday nights that much more special.
11760040	11761000	Thank you for being here.
11761560	11765320	It wouldn't be so fun if we didn't have the chat room and you've been a huge presence
11765320	11769720	in our chat room with your insightful comments and you've got a very rich knowledge about
11769720	11773800	a lot of games and you do a lot of live fact checking on the show and I appreciate that.
11774680	11777880	It's better to fact check live than get the email the next week.
11777880	11779800	Boy, you guys really fucked up that one story.
11779960	11785160	It's so nice to have that live and just super appreciate that, my friend.
11786040	11786920	Thank you.
11786920	11787480	All right.
11787480	11791400	Well, Orange Wright, you take care and I hope we hear from you again when we're not running
11791400	11792120	three and a half hours.
11792840	11793160	All right.
11793720	11794760	Take care, my friend.
11794760	11795240	Bye bye.
11797080	11800760	So I'm intentionally leaving someone in there to be last.
11800760	11806440	So just to be clear, I'm not purposely pulling it.
11806440	11808760	I'm not purposely letting people jump the line.
11808760	11811560	I'm purposely letting having one person have the last word.
11811560	11814600	We have another call coming in, though, so let's get to it.
11814600	11815160	Hello.
11815160	11816200	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11816200	11816600	Who's this?
11819240	11825560	Okay, you might be muted or you're just not realizing we picked you up on Discord yet.
11830600	11831000	Hello.
11831640	11832120	Hola.
11832120	11834360	Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
11836280	11836760	Okay.
11836840	11838760	We're having some mic trouble.
11838760	11839560	Yeah.
11839560	11842760	Hey, call us next week because I would love to hear from you.
11843880	11847320	All right, let's get to the last call.
11848760	11849320	This is it.
11851160	11852680	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11852680	11853160	Who's this?
11856360	11858920	No, don't tell me they don't know their mics on or not here.
11858920	11859560	Hello.
11859560	11860760	If you hear me, you're on the air.
11860760	11868200	Ah, I don't know how to.
11869000	11869560	What are we?
11869560	11871640	Are we doing something wrong where, like, people don't know?
11871640	11873960	Like, it's probably not like beeping or something like that.
11873960	11875560	So let me see.
11878920	11881480	I'm gonna just ping them in chat, see if they.
11884120	11885320	He's not muted.
11885320	11887080	No, it's not muted on Discord.
11887080	11888120	Unless it's a hard mute.
11888120	11890200	So for whatever reason, the mic isn't picking it up.
11891480	11893080	All right.
11894360	11894760	You know what?
11895960	11898520	We have a return.
11899640	11901960	We are going to deposit you back in the green room and try
11901960	11902520	one more time.
11903720	11904200	Okay.
11904200	11906200	Meanwhile, let's try this.
11906200	11907320	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11907320	11907820	Who's this?
11908280	11909480	This is Drew.
11909480	11909960	Drew.
11909960	11911160	It's good to hear from you.
11911160	11911960	You got it to work.
11911960	11913320	What's up, my friend?
11917000	11917640	What'd you say?
11917640	11919720	Haven't seen you in a long time.
11920760	11922920	Thank God we're in a virtual environment now.
11922920	11925320	So you can't break anything.
11927400	11928680	That you know of.
11928680	11929880	I'm breaking hearts every day.
11929880	11930680	What are you talking about?
11931480	11934120	Drew, I have to ask you something, and I don't want to hear
11934120	11937080	the answer to this, but I'm gonna ask this question anyway,
11937080	11938360	and I'm gonna be very upset.
11939320	11940280	How old are you now?
11942680	11945000	Just a little less older than the show.
11945000	11945640	No, I'm kidding.
11947080	11948360	Do you really want the answer?
11949080	11950280	Unfortunately, yes.
11951000	11955800	Ah, I share a birthday with good old Orange Lounge Radio.
11955800	11957320	So I am now 37.
11958440	11958760	Row.
11962840	11963160	Hello.
11963160	11963480	Hello.
11965480	11967560	Yes, in a total row.
11967560	11968840	Yes, there you go.
11968840	11970680	And he's going to be in a total row about it.
11972120	11975720	I remember this kid was like 21 the first time he came on
11975720	11976200	OLR.
11976920	11977800	Oh, Jesus.
11977800	11979880	I was younger than that when you were.
11982760	11987000	Oh, you have made those so much progress, and I'm ridiculously
11987000	11987560	proud of you.
11988680	11990920	All right, you have.
11990920	11992360	Good God, you've come a long way.
11994520	11995240	And I got the right.
11997800	11999240	So let me ask this.
11999240	12000280	The two minute rules in effect.
12000280	12000760	I'm so sorry.
12000760	12002520	I'd love to talk to you longer, but quickly.
12003480	12008040	What do you want to tell people about the old days of OLR?
12008040	12009800	Because believe it or not, we have a lot of newer listeners
12009800	12010520	because of Twitch and all that.
12010520	12013560	So not everybody was here back in the Rob's Garage day and
12013560	12014520	things like that.
12014520	12017080	What's like a memory from the old OLR, something people
12017080	12017800	should know about it?
12018680	12019480	Oh, my God.
12020920	12026120	If there's any one mascot there that screams OLR or rather
12026120	12028760	chirps OLR, it is that old bush baby ferret.
12029720	12032840	And I know it's been a very, very, very long time since
12032840	12034680	that same thing has been on the airwaves.
12036840	12040120	That thing doesn't even work anymore, but I have it.
12040120	12041720	It ended up in a wood chipper.
12041720	12044120	No, it was this little thing that made a noise that said,
12044120	12044760	Excuse me.
12045320	12048520	No, because Loki found like a store that had like five more.
12048520	12051080	And I remember he dumped a whole box out one episode.
12051080	12054120	I think Angel or one of our other fans took one.
12055000	12057240	One of them got on the Grotto Mori.
12057240	12057960	Oh, yeah, that's right.
12057960	12060680	One of them got stuck on the Katamari at E3 that one year.
12060680	12062040	That was fucking funny.
12062040	12063960	So at E3, they were hyping.
12063960	12066840	I think the sequel was like beautiful Katamari or one of
12066840	12069320	those games, and they actually had a Katamari you could stick
12069320	12069880	things to.
12069880	12073480	And one of those ferrets ended up on the fucking Katamari
12073480	12074760	they had at E3.
12074760	12077160	That's probably sitting in a Namco office somewhere now or
12077160	12077720	a dumpster.
12077720	12078220	Who knows?
12079160	12082280	But just in case y'all thought that everybody was entirely
12082280	12084920	serious all the time, even back then, ferrets.
12085240	12086600	Every time.
12087720	12089880	Check out Bungie Ferret Tossing on 360.
12089880	12091160	Somebody made a game about that.
12091160	12093480	Just I don't know if you were here for that, but it's pretty
12093480	12096120	wild how things came full circle.
12096120	12097080	You have a hand in that?
12098200	12099560	No, this is all YYR.
12100760	12103560	I think we might have done voices or something, but there's
12103560	12106840	pictures of our pets in there that sadly, some of them have
12106840	12107480	left this realm.
12107480	12109640	But yeah, because it's kind of an older game at this point.
12110680	12113000	All right, Drew, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up.
12113000	12114760	We're seriously at the three and a half hour point.
12115160	12115960	Take care, my friend.
12116760	12117160	You too.
12117160	12118280	Congratulations, y'all.
12118280	12118760	Thank you.
12118760	12119160	Thanks.
12119160	12120280	Thanks for being a part of it.
12120920	12121480	Take care.
12121480	12122920	Proud to be real.
12124120	12125000	37.
12127160	12128040	37.
12131080	12134040	Let's try one more time with this last caller tonight.
12134040	12134600	Hello.
12134600	12136760	You are on Orange Lawn's radio.
12136760	12137240	Who's this?
12140520	12142440	Oh, no, I think it's still broken.
12142440	12146440	And I just I don't know if this individual can hear us.
12146440	12148920	It's a bummer, because back in the Skype days, we used to say
12148920	12151000	call Echo 123 to test your connection.
12151000	12152920	There's nothing like that on Discord, so we kind of have to
12152920	12154440	figure this stuff out live.
12154440	12158600	So I'm going to try one more time.
12160280	12163880	See if this person can, because I don't know if Discord
12163880	12165640	always beeps in your ear.
12165640	12169080	So if you and what I'm worried people might be doing is that
12169080	12174440	they're muting Discord and listening on Twitch.
12174440	12177000	And so they don't hear that they got brought into the room.
12177560	12179960	Oh, the camera's switching.
12179960	12183000	So maybe it's getting figured out.
12185240	12185800	Who knows?
12187000	12189800	But Bobby says they do have Discord settings to test your
12189800	12192600	device. It records and it plays audio back to you.
12195560	12197560	My heart is breaking, but I don't think it's working.
12198520	12202280	It's just we're getting the spinning hourglass wheel.
12203400	12205880	Man. Bummer.
12207080	12207960	All right.
12207960	12209240	I'm sorry, Dark Tetsuya.
12209240	12211880	I would love to hear from you and let you have the final word.
12211880	12212840	Oh, it's trying one more time.
12213640	12215000	I'm worried if it even gets through.
12217240	12217480	No.
12219320	12220280	I see it spinning.
12220280	12221080	It hating.
12221080	12221880	Yeah, it's hating.
12221880	12223320	I'm sorry, Dark Tetsuya.
12223320	12225720	Yeah, he said his internet wasn't working right properly
12225800	12229880	either, but I'm sure you understand it is live radio and
12229880	12230920	we've got to wrap it up.
12230920	12232120	We're at the three and a half hour mark.
12232120	12235000	Please send in your thoughts and just know I saved you for
12235000	12236920	last because I know you've been here since the very first
12236920	12239080	episode. I wanted you to be the final voice tonight.
12239640	12242840	It's a bummer technology sucks, but thank you for all that
12242840	12245000	you've done over the years for us, my friend.
12245000	12247240	And we'll see you next week.
12247240	12248760	I hope we see everybody next week.
12248760	12252120	I know we've had a long, long show tonight, but we've had a
12252120	12253560	long history.
12254360	12259240	It's been 20 years of this, and thank you all for your
12259240	12259640	support.
12260360	12261320	I can't even.
12261320	12261640	I know.
12261640	12262280	I can't even.
12262280	12265560	It's one of those things where, like, I can't even like
12265560	12267720	I hear, Oh, we've been going for 20 years.
12267720	12270600	I have a hard time even, like, conceptualizing, like, what
12270600	12273400	it is or even though I'm like, I'm living it.
12273400	12275240	It's weird to think like, Oh, 20 years.
12275240	12275560	Wow.
12278760	12280360	It's wild.
12280360	12281240	It is.
12281240	12282840	It's absolutely intense.
12282840	12283160	It is.
12284840	12287400	Well, what do I say here at the end as we start to recap
12287400	12289880	tonight? Thank you all for being a part of this, whether
12289880	12292440	it was just tonight, whether it's been for the last 20
12292440	12294760	years, whether it's been for the last 20 minutes.
12296520	12298600	I just want to say thank you so much for being a part of
12298600	12299720	Orange Launch Radio.
12299720	12301560	Thanks for being a part of this family and our Sunday
12301560	12305560	night little gathering here and playing a part in it.
12307640	12310200	So many dreams have really come true because of this show
12310200	12313800	as talking about earlier, getting to do E3 in the beginning,
12313800	12317080	getting games and cameos and video games because of this
12317080	12319080	show, getting to meet people.
12319080	12320360	I travel to cities.
12321960	12323720	I don't want to say around the world because I'm not quite
12323720	12325880	that well traveled by travel to cities around the US and
12325880	12328920	Canada and any city I go to.
12328920	12332040	It's like I know somebody here, and if it's not because of
12332040	12335240	OLR directly, it's because somebody I met because of OLR
12335240	12336280	and that whole sort of thing.
12336280	12339400	And just the impact that the show has had is just incredible.
12339480	12341320	And the opportunities I've been given to do things like
12341320	12344840	panels at Dragon Con, which has led to other big things.
12344840	12346600	It's just incredible.
12346600	12349080	And I don't know what else to say, but thank you for being
12349080	12349640	a part of it.
12350920	12352680	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,
12352680	12354120	tell a friend or two about the show.
12354120	12355960	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every
12355960	12358280	gamer has a voice, but we need more voices.
12358280	12358600	Always.
12358600	12359880	We're still in search of new voices.
12361000	12363160	Let's get some more.
12363160	12364360	Let's get some new faces.
12364360	12365480	We love the old faces too.
12365480	12368120	Let's get some new faces for some new opinions as we move
12368120	12372200	into our 21st year starting next week and approaching the
12372200	12373080	legal drinking age.
12374760	12377400	Let's go around to get everybody's final thoughts tonight.
12378040	12379240	Loki, I will start with you.
12379240	12379960	Your final thought.
12380760	12383000	My final thought is I would like to remind everybody that
12383000	12388280	the Steam Summer Sale is going on right now and certain YYR
12388280	12392520	games and a certain game about, you know, poop and NES and
12392520	12394360	stuff may be on sale right now.
12394360	12396040	Also on itch.io is also on sale.
12396600	12399960	So check out Pixel Poops number two for $6.99.
12400920	12402520	Way to bury the lead.
12402520	12403720	You should have said that at the start.
12403720	12406440	But no, I hope you sell lots.
12409640	12412200	Dark Sakura, I know you're still going to do some Debbie
12412200	12413720	tonight, even with the long run time.
12413720	12414920	What is your final thought tonight?
12416120	12417400	Reject false icons.
12418280	12419160	What a throwback.
12419160	12420040	Have a good night, Jamie.
12420600	12421960	Have a good stream later.
12421960	12422600	Later, Tater.
12423560	12425000	And then my final thought tonight.
12428200	12429320	I'm 44 today.
12429320	12431560	We haven't talked a lot about the fact that it is my birthday
12431560	12433400	because we're focusing on OLR's birthday right now.
12434360	12436920	I was supposed to be in Europe today.
12436920	12438360	Yes, I was going to miss this show.
12438360	12441240	We would have just had the 20th anniversary be next week or
12441240	12441800	something.
12441800	12444360	But I was originally going to be in Europe today because I
12444360	12447080	was going to see ABBA Voyage, which if you know me, you know
12447080	12448760	I'm a huge ABBA stan.
12448760	12449560	I love them.
12449560	12451560	And seeing Voyage would have been like the closest thing to
12451560	12452920	actually seeing them live.
12452920	12454840	It didn't work out that way.
12454840	12458360	Just because since I bought the tickets that have now gone
12458360	12461960	to waste with it away, I got diagnosed with diabetes.
12462840	12466040	We bought the house, but we weren't able to get as much help
12466040	12468120	on the house as we were originally going to get because
12468120	12469000	of some family things.
12469000	12469800	That's all I'm going to say.
12471400	12472760	And just some things happen.
12472760	12475080	And so the Europe trip wasn't able to happen this time.
12477160	12477960	But that's okay.
12477960	12479560	Things have a way of working out.
12479560	12481880	And I'm really trying to be thankful for the things I do
12481880	12488360	have. Great job, great health under control now that I know
12488360	12489080	what's going on.
12490600	12497480	And this and all of you that give a shit and go the extra
12497480	12498600	mile with this every week.
12499960	12501560	I'm very thankful for that.
12501560	12504920	And it gives me a lot to be happy about on my birthday today
12504920	12506200	as well as OLR's birthday.
12506200	12506760	So thank you.
12507400	12510360	And to kind of piggyback on something that was said earlier
12510360	12512520	in the show, I don't feel 44.
12513240	12514360	Do I look 44?
12514360	12515320	Don't answer that.
12515320	12516680	I don't feel 44.
12516680	12517640	I still feel young.
12517640	12522200	And I think if this show does go until I'm 64, probably not
12522200	12523880	going to realize it then either.
12523880	12531000	So yeah, I don't know what else to say for the first time
12531000	12532360	in a 20 year history.
12532360	12533240	I'm out of words.
12535160	12536200	Thank you, everyone.
12536200	12537000	We'll see you next week.
12537000	12538280	Have a wonderful night.
12538280	12538760	Good night.
12566200	12568280	But you know they were all still true.
12571000	12572280	See you next week.
