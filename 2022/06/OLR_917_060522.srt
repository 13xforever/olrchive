1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,200
It's June! That means that the preparation for the big descent upon Los Angeles isâ€¦

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,120
deferred for another year, at least. Even without the annual pilgrimage of media, studios,

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,440
hopefuls and personalities, there is still plenty of news coming down the pipe. Less

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,060
of it now before the avalanche that is the keynotes by console manufacturers and other

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,680
large parties next week.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,720
This is the first of two annual thematic intros. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about the gaming news, starting right now

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,840
on the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:45,440
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,600
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,840
number 917 of our show for tonight, June 5th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and not

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,880
joining us tonight, sadly, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She is off tonight as she was helping

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,520
a friend move all the way to Illinois. What a good friend to move across halfway across

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,160
the country. But I believe she's traveling back tonight, but I just don't think she gets

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,760
back by showtime. So we do have here joining us tonight, as always, say hello to Techmaster

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
Loki.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
Hello.

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
Hi, Loki. How are you?

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm doing fine.

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,120
Ah, great. So, okay. I have to ask about this. So of course we do tape live Sunday nights

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,560
at VOG Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network. That's Voice of Geeks Network. 9 p.m. Eastern,

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,100
6 p.m. Pacific. Say that three times fast. Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Now

23
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,120
Bobby is good enough to have us on his show every week, right at the end of the show to

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,840
do like a little, you know, toss across call like they do on some news shows basically

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,360
like stay tuned. This is what's coming up. And the subject of like naming kids after

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,160
video game or movie characters came up and Bobby and I kind of both landed on the same

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,720
page of, well, we're not having kids, so this is really a non-issue. Our pets maybe, but

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,420
so far not really. But Loki, you are a parent and you have children who are not named after

29
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,380
video game characters.

30
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:25,180
Well, one sorta, but not really. It's the grandparents name, but it shares, you know.

31
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,540
Got it. But you had mentioned that you were considering at one point giving them the middle

32
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,620
name Vader. Then it was like, wait a minute, I never heard this.

33
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,060
Just my oldest son. Because we were kind of figuring out, well, what should the middle

34
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:49,900
name be? Because we have like, you know, they have to be named after someone who is dead.

35
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,960
So like, like for their first name has to start with like a letter of someone that's

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:02,020
dead in the family. And then the middle name is just kind of whatever. So I think Nellie

37
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,620
was the one that suggested that first.

38
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,560
That sounds like people may think it was your idea, but I'm like, Oh no, it was the wife.

39
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,280
It was, it was, it was Mrs. Loki for sure.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,440
Yeah. And then somehow we, we, we settled on something not bad, but like, I don't know

41
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,560
that it was something that was definitely being tossed around for, you know, a little

42
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
bit.

43
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,760
I think it was, I think the whole like names that almost were stories are very interesting

44
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,760
for some reason. I mentioned this on Bobby's show, but I was very like, my name was changed

45
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,640
at the last second, the day of my name was originally supposed to be Brad.

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,240
So, but they changed it, which is funny if you know, you know, consider my involvement

47
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,480
in the Rocky or a picture show and the parts I played a years later, but it's just, you

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,920
know, it's one of those things where Nope, they, they changed it. So I could be named

49
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,120
after both my grandparents instead of just one. So it's a, it's interesting though.

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,400
Yeah. And then of course, you know, my youngest son, he has, you know, and I think I've mentioned

51
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,560
this when, when he was born, like, so his middle name is Layton, which is kind of like

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,000
professor Lee, but not, it's not really meant for that. Okay. Yeah. Fair enough. All right.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,640
So what is it? What is, so of course, since we do tape live on Twitch, sometimes you can

54
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,320
either see a webcam background or you can see a video game green screen background and

55
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,400
Loki's case. And I'm not sure I recognize the game playing behind you tonight. It looks

56
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,400
like an Indiana Jones sort of thing, but what is, what is that playing behind you tonight?

57
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,280
Indiana Jones. What is it? That's that's hopper. Oh, it's the stranger things game.

58
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,520
Yeah. Oh, see, I didn't really play it to be honest. So, well, I play stranger things

59
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,200
instead of daylight, but yeah, that's a, okay. Okay. Ah, it's hopper. How could I, how could

60
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,160
I miss that? Okay. I got it. Is this because you recently watched season four, which I

61
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,960
still haven't watched.

62
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,600
Season four, part one. Yes. They're holding on to two episodes. Well, was it part two?

63
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,120
I hear is like two episodes, but it's apparently like two movie length episodes. So it's still,

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,040
it's still pretty, I mean, some of the episodes are pretty long in the first half. I mean,

65
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,560
there's one that was like almost an hour and a half. So I don't know. Well, it's good.

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,880
I'll, uh, I'll get around to seeing it at some point, but I just, I canceled Netflix.

67
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,600
So it's like, oh, now I got to either borrow a login or, you know, other ways. But, um,

68
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,840
yeah, uh, it's just bad timing, I guess on that, but I haven't been in a huge, you know,

69
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,040
with all the other stuff that's been going on lately, I just haven't really sat down

70
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,000
to watch, watch a lot of TV shows, except drag race, all stars, all winners.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,200
That's the only show I've really made time for. So, all right. Um, let's get into some

72
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,640
of the week, a week's news in video games of which there was plenty, because even though

73
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,240
there's no E3 this year, we still have some interesting things that are timed around E3,

74
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,820
such as Sony's state of play, which we'll start talking about tonight. Um, although

75
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,360
I don't know about you, Loki, like, I know you want to get into some of the weeds of

76
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,440
what they announced. We can talk about that. But I, I mean, yes, there were some big announcements.

77
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm not saying it was bad by any means. I thought, especially for like, compared to

78
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,920
most data plays, it was, it was pretty meaty. Like they had some really big announcements

79
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,320
there. It was good. I just didn't think it was a replacement for an E3 show, uh, that

80
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,320
they usually do now, but it was, well, I don't know if that, yeah, it, I don't think

81
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,040
so. I mean, but when you think about it, like a lot of it is like third party stuff that,

82
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,240
you know, and even the stuff that they talked about third party, like you could still see

83
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,320
some of that maybe being in like Jeff Keeley's thing because yeah, there wasn't a whole lot

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,560
of first party stuff that they announced. I mean, they did have some things, but it

85
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,080
wasn't like first party heavy, I guess. Yeah. Maybe they want to reveal some of those street

86
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,360
fighter six characters, summer game fat. Oh wait. Uh, well we'll get to that, but officially

87
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,720
revealed officially. Yeah. All right. Well tell us a little bit, why don't you run down

88
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,560
some of the headlines? We'll talk a little bit about it. Um, I couldn't watch it live

89
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,180
as work has just been very, very busy for me. So like if a press conference or whatever

90
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,320
it is, a state of play is happening during working hours on the West coast, uh, I can,

91
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,240
and that, that sucks. I'm not going to be able to watch or live stream summer game Fest

92
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,800
this year, which I was really looking forward to doing, but it's like 11 AM on a day. I'm

93
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,040
literally in class all day. But anyway, so I did watch after the fact, so I could fast

94
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,500
forward through the trailers. I didn't care about, which was great. Um, but there really

95
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,300
wasn't, there actually was very little I fast forwarded through. So it was very interesting,

96
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,720
but anyway. Yeah. So, uh, they led off with resident evil for the remake for that. And

97
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,140
that looks pretty, pretty nice. I'm supposed to be coming out March 24th of next year.

98
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,720
And along with that, of course, and this led into a lot of the PlayStation VR two stuff

99
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,960
that they're showing off. So there is going to be some sort of content for resident evil

100
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,000
for remake that is PlayStation VR two stuff. Um, along with that, they showed that they're

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,720
going to be bringing a resident evil seven or was it eight, eight, the village, whatever

102
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:15,800
that one was. Um, that was eight and they're going to be bringing that to VR as well. And

103
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,560
they let, they'd let off with the, the most appropriate footage I could think that they

104
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,940
would have for VR presentation. Um, they know their target audience. Uh, that's for sure.

105
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,820
So that is coming at some point. I'm not sure when on that. And don't forget seven

106
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,600
was the one they called biohazard. And then it was flipped in Japan where seven was resident

107
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,500
evil or biohazard seven resident evil. So seven was that one. But, um, yeah, eight is

108
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,420
a village and just the whole idea of lady Debitrescu and VR, which was all that, like,

109
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,620
it's funny because spoiler alert, but not really spoiler alert. Like she's only in the

110
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,900
first part of the game. Like she's only like, that's divided up into different segments.

111
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:03,140
She's only really in the first segment. I'll let you guess why. Um, but, uh, it's, it's,

112
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,780
it's one of those things where it's like, they really build the marketing around her

113
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,860
because she's such a strong character. If they do a resident evil nine, like she has

114
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,600
to be back somehow. Like she's, she's like Wesker nemesis level, like antagonist now,

115
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,860
like they have to, I wouldn't be surprised if they fucking build resident evil nine around

116
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,860
her.

117
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:28,060
Um, so yeah, I mean it looked, it looked all right. Um, so other PlayStation VR two stuff,

118
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:38,060
they showed off the, um, new, I guess it's, it's, I don't know if it's a, I guess it's

119
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,980
its own unique game. I'm not really sure if it's like a side story character that's in

120
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:50,060
the regular game or not. Um, but they have a new horizon, a VR game, which looks amazing.

121
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,980
So that's really going to be showing off.

122
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,860
That was a very meaty announcement for the PS VR two. I mean, well, they'd announced

123
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,540
it before, but you know, like now that we really get to see it, like it looked like

124
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,380
I was like, okay, damn, this could, this could be like a system selling sort of, you know,

125
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,500
I think half life Alex for the PlayStation type of game kind of. Yeah. I mean, it looked

126
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:17,140
very, very polished and it looks just like this is going to be the one that shows off,

127
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,020
you know, the features of PlayStation VR two. I, I do want to take a minute. Sorry. I don't

128
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,860
mean to bounce back too much, but because we do tape live, we get chat comments. So I want to

129
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,820
read over here from chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, tiger class says, so we're getting

130
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,460
a remake of resident evil for a couple of years from now, we'll get more remakes of the newer

131
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:41,940
games. Well, keep in mind, it may only feel like a couple of years. Resident evil four was

132
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,180
originally out like around the time this show started. That was, we're at, we're 20 years this

133
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,820
month, buddy. So even though it feels like resident evil four was just a few years ago,

134
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,300
that was 20 years ago, my friend. Also some of that may feel more recent because they did port

135
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,300
that stuff. They have ported it again and again. That's very true. It's like a lot of the final

136
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:08,420
fantasy games. So, yeah. So I mean, when we talk about what could technology look like for a

137
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:14,020
resident evil seven or eight remake 20 years from now, you know, it's going to probably be very

138
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,540
heavy AR VR, like it's, it's going to be like, it's, it's just not, I don't think we can even

139
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:27,620
envision in our minds what it will look like, because when we were all playing super Nintendo,

140
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,340
I don't think we could, which granted is more like 30 years back, but I don't think we could

141
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:38,340
visualize at that time. What gaming would look like now, just that it was more real,

142
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,020
but what does that mean? Right? So it's just, yeah. Anyway, sorry.

143
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,540
Of course, no man's sky had a trailer because they're bringing it to PlayStation VR too,

144
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,140
as well since it, you know, it's been on PlayStation VR, so why not?

145
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,260
I love no man's sky. You know, I give that game a lot of support, even when it probably

146
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,340
doesn't deserve it. No, but I do. I love that game. And it's a great comeback story in gaming.

147
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:09,060
That was like the biggest, like, of course, like, and like, it's like, was it ever a question that

148
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:15,060
no man's sky would be playable? Like, was anybody out there thinking it wouldn't be playable? Like,

149
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,220
does anyone want to fess up that they, they thought it wouldn't be playable on PlayStation VR

150
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:25,060
too? Really? Really? So at the very least, they thought like the PlayStation 4 version

151
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,860
would be on PlayStation VR too. So as much as I love that game, that was very much the

152
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,180
refrigerator break because you know, no shit. That game's coming out PlayStation VR too. No shit.

153
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,300
Spider-Man Remastered is coming out on PC. So that's coming out August 12th,

154
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,460
which is kind of surprising. A little less, well.

155
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,380
A little less surprising is because we are getting a lot more of that stuff.

156
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,260
Yeah. We know Sony's been trying to strengthen their PC. I think it's surprising that, oh,

157
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:00,020
License Marvel Spider-Man is the game that's, so it's interesting to see that confirmed. And

158
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,940
I think just kind of adds to all the pieces last week on, um, you know, Sony strengthening

159
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:13,940
their PR PC base. Yeah. Uh, we got another trailer for stray, which looks awesome. That's the cyber

160
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,940
punk cat game. It looks really cool. It was so cute. If you're a cat person, that game is so

161
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:29,460
on your radar and we know it's coming out what July 19th now? Uh, yes. Um, what I thought was

162
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,340
interesting about that is that it's a PlayStation plus, but I think they said only the higher tiers,

163
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:40,980
right? Not the base tier. Yeah. So that's interesting. Yeah. E3VL points that out too.

164
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,300
Sucks. Not free on PlayStation plus essentials. Um, they have to sweeten the pot on those upper

165
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,100
tiers. So I actually think that's a good move on their part. Uh, and I don't think this will be

166
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,860
the last one. Uh, sure. First party game at all. I don't think it is. I think it's like a second

167
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,740
party studio, but I'm not 100%. Cause if it wasn't, if it was like a third party indie

168
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,060
studio or something like that, it'd be funny if that was, you know, PC game pass or something

169
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:15,060
like that, you know, included, but I doubt it. Yeah. Um, let's see what else? So we had a roller

170
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,340
drone, which is pretty cool. This is a new game from the developers of Ali Ali world. It's kind

171
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:29,140
of like this roller skating, um, shooter type game done in like a really retro skates and you

172
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:35,460
like guns. Boy, do I have the game for you? I do. But the art style was very nice. It does look

173
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:42,100
cool. Yeah. So that's coming out August 16th. They had new trailer for tunic, which is, um,

174
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,420
speaking of game pass games, but now going the other way around. Right. So this is Microsoft's

175
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,900
uh, going to, uh, thank you. Bobby black Wolf confirms stray is an Annapurna game.

176
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,340
So, and it is releasing on steam the same day. So Annapurna also brought us, um, like there are,

177
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:01,540
there are good, uh, indie game publisher. Like I want to say, um, Oh my God, what was that music

178
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,260
game that I was obsessed with? Cause the music was so good and it sounded like a church's album.

179
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,260
Um, that was an Annapurna game. And then I like, Oh, I know what you're talking about. I can't

180
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,380
think of the name. Yeah. And then some of the wild hearts. Yes. That was Annapurna to get that.

181
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,620
Um, I believe they did. Everybody's gone to the rapture. I might be wrong. No. Cause that was

182
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:26,020
Chinese room. Wasn't it? Yes. Yeah. So I, but Annapurna publishes a lot of those indie games,

183
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:31,940
that 120 minutes I think was them. So there was that. Uh, although if we're talking about stray,

184
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,020
wouldn't that be an Annapurna game? It would be very appropriately.

185
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:44,020
Uh, we have a new trailer of the coolest, the cholesterol, uh, protocol, and that's, uh, done

186
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:50,740
by the creators of dead space and it looks very much dead space. So that's, uh, very scary. Not

187
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:58,260
gonna play that. Um, we got a couple other, that was my looks very scary. Not going to play it very,

188
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,620
very, uh, on brand with my assessment too. Uh, we got another trailer for season,

189
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,860
a letter to the future. Um, that game looks really interesting. Yeah.

190
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,660
I didn't know until, you know, Kotaku and some of the other missed media. So I didn't realize

191
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,460
that was like the indie studio that had some issues behind the scenes development stuff.

192
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,220
So yeah, the game looks very, um, interesting though. And I hope some of those other issues

193
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,380
are resolved as in that boss is no longer around that. I'm I haven't read up on that.

194
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,140
They have a, there was a trailer for a turn nights, which is like a, it looks like a JRPG

195
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,900
action game with a dating game built in as well. So neat.

196
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,300
That's an interesting crossover. I bet the trailer was interesting enough where I'm like,

197
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,460
tell me more. I'd like to see what the actual gameplay kind of looks like, but interesting.

198
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:56,500
Yeah. Yeah. Um, what else? We also had a new trailer for final fantasy 16,

199
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,220
which is supposed to be coming out sometime in summer of next year. Yeah.

200
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,700
I still don't this. It's very confusing to me what the game is going to be. It's like

201
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:13,300
summon, summon, summon, summon, summon, summon. Okay. So I can maybe give a little insight to

202
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,260
this from final fantasy 14 and just say that like, not that the two games are necessarily related,

203
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:23,780
but, um, just, I will, I will spoil a, a relatively minor plot point in the

204
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,540
heaven's word expansion, which is now, if you haven't played heaven's word yet,

205
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:33,220
you're four expansions behind, right? No three expansions behind. So I kind of think that's on

206
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:41,300
you. Um, so there is a point in heaven's word where Shiva, who is, um, embodied in basically

207
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:47,460
a human character, but she can kind of summon Shiva out of her essence on demand. I'm really

208
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,300
simplifying some of the story elements here, uh, takes on a primal or a summon that's summoned by

209
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,540
a monster clan called Ravana. And these two summons fight each other. So Shiva and Ravana

210
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,260
actually get into a fight and Ravana was a final fantasy 14 original summon, but he's just like,

211
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,860
otherwise he's just like, you know, all the other summons. Um, and, uh, they get into a fight and

212
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,740
it, that you actually see like, uh, Shiva tried to diamond dust Ravana and all this stuff. And

213
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,980
Ravana is like, cause Ravana is like the, the, the four or six armed bug. You've probably seen some

214
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,940
screenshots and he has the Russian throat singing background music, which we'll get into the music

215
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:33,700
in a minute. But, um, the, the, um, the, the fight is so good. Like the way it's, it plays out in

216
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,220
the game. And I was like, dang, like seeing summons fight each other is actually really

217
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,700
awesome. And I remember saying at that point, I wish this was something the series kind of did

218
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,780
more of, and that's why now when I look at 16, I'm like, holy shit, somebody heard that. Like,

219
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,100
they really are like, it seems like they're making a game where like now in the final fantasy was

220
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,460
like the summons are kind of, or it seems like the summons are more like representative of these

221
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:04,020
like warring factions and so forth. But like in 14, they are like, people seem to embody them.

222
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,820
So this is, it's very interesting to me. Um, so I'm down with it. The only thing where I'm a

223
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,940
little bit like, Oh, that's a disappointment is that it looks like they got rid of parties,

224
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:20,100
at least in the footage we saw that it's like, you're essentially playing alone. Now,

225
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:27,460
14. I mean, yes, there are multiplayer dungeons and multiplayer events. But for the most part,

226
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,100
you play a lot of that solo. And I don't think the game hurts because of that. I do know party

227
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,140
members come in as NPCs. And I'm hoping there's at least that in this game. But it's a little,

228
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,580
it just seems like a core Final Fantasy mechanic that's like missing. But you know,

229
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,100
they did co op. That'd be awesome. So I feel like there's still a lot we need to learn there.

230
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,820
At the end of the day, even though my brain is like, Okay, I don't know how I feel about this

231
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,860
game, not having parties, and that it seems to be actually again, and we're never going to go back

232
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:03,620
to a turn based battle system. There's a part of me that's like, Rob have faith. This is the team

233
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:09,620
that saved the entire fucking franchise. So I'm gonna I'm gonna keep an open mind to all of this

234
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:15,860
because you know what Yoshi P saved Final Fantasy period. So and a lot of these people that he's

235
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,340
bringing on are a lot of the teams behind these more recent Final Fantasies that, you know, have

236
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,580
been pretty, pretty awesome. So I'm gonna give it a shot. And I think most importantly, most

237
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,580
importantly, as far as who's involved in making the game, so can who does the music for 14 is

238
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,140
going to do the music for 16. That should have been that was pretty obvious the minute that

239
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:44,100
trailer had the opera song with the names of the Yeah, that's a very soak and thing to do. So it's

240
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:50,020
really but then they confirmed it on like the website later. And I like again, I can't I know

241
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,220
a lot of you dodge 14 because it's an MMO with a monthly fee. I understand that you owe it to

242
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:02,820
yourself to still listen to the soundtrack. It is so fucking good that soak and proves he's like the

243
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:09,700
only person capable of replacing noble we Matsu not that we Matsu can ever be replaced. But we all

244
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:15,220
know he's kind of retired as a worthy successor sunset. Yes. So can is absolutely a worthy

245
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,820
successor to the Final Fantasy franchise. I'm so fucking excited to hear 16 soundtrack. Like,

246
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,220
I'm more I'm more excited for the soundtrack that I am the game, if I can be perfectly honest.

247
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:32,420
So not to again, not to set the bar too high, but I can't help it and help it.

248
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:37,220
I'd still play it, or at least buy it. Because I can't say I will play it for long because like I

249
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:43,220
did 15 I need to go back to 15 dark to see says could they put him on Dragon Quest? I'd be okay

250
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,740
with that. God Yes, I would be too. However, the man is only capable of so much. There are some

251
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,900
other great composers like 11 had a pair of really good composers that worked with noble Matsu. And

252
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:00,420
so the so there's other composers within square that could take on Dragon Quest. And yes, Dragon

253
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:07,060
Quest badly needs needs a new composer. So you know, sorry, not sorry, like, but outside of the

254
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,660
iconic theme, the soundtrack was like by far the weakest point of 11. And it's time to move on.

255
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,260
Hopefully the success of Final Fantasy and so kind of push square in that direction. We'll see.

256
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:25,620
We'll see. And keep in mind, Yoshi P came to light and got got prevalent because of Dragon Quest 10.

257
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,580
A lot of people don't realize that he didn't produce that game. But he was like the quest

258
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,460
and scenario designer for that game. And that's, that's kind of how he started ascending up through

259
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:40,500
Square Enix. So you didn't already know Yoshi P came from Dragon Quest 10, basically. Anyway,

260
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,820
um, what are your thoughts on Final Fantasy 16? Loki?

261
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,260
I mean, it looks all right. I just don't understand what's going on.

262
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:54,420
That was kind of like 15 ever. You know, no, no, we didn't. I don't think there's ever

263
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,300
seven. Seven. I understood what was kind of going on. That was a little easier to follow.

264
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,180
Seven. So that was 1997.

265
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,980
I think. I think seven. 10 was still kind of okay. Easy to follow.

266
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,220
Yeah, 1010. I think I'm kind of knew what to expect. Yeah.

267
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,780
But 11. I never knew what was going on.

268
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,980
12. No way. Absolutely not.

269
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,860
13. No, I got not used with the, with the, the Falsi and the, I don't even know what will see

270
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:31,540
in the Falsi and the sea falls here. Like, I don't know what any of this is. Uh, too, too much lore,

271
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:38,740
too much lore now. Um, yeah. So I think after about 10, like I've lost, have been unable to

272
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:44,980
follow the storyline of that stuff, but I mean, they're, they're pretty good games. Just 15 though,

273
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,740
like, like, I don't, I made them old school, the way of thinking. I just, I don't,

274
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,420
I don't like the non term-based stuff now seven remake.

275
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,620
I know that's great. That's pretty cool. Like, uh, I could maybe deal with something like that,

276
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:10,820
but this doesn't look like that. I don't hate 15, but I think there were some bad decisions

277
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:18,980
due to 15's way too long development that put it, that made it less than what it could have been.

278
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:24,820
And I think it's most apparent when you get Shiva. I'm just going to speak a little like,

279
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,100
if you haven't played that game yet and you're sensitive about spoilers, like,

280
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,180
I really feel like you probably should have played it by now. And this is, this is relatively minor.

281
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:37,460
Um, but you get Shiva as a summon, just she, she approaches you and the train breaks down

282
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:44,820
and the train breaks down in front of ice caverns. And it's, it's painfully obvious.

283
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,860
There was supposed to be a whole sequence there that the train breaks down. You gotta go in the

284
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,140
ice caverns, get it, you know, while it gets fixed, you encounter Shiva and figure out,

285
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,980
I won't tell you who Shiva really is. Cause you see who Shiva is earlier in the story,

286
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,980
but, um, there's a whole, there it's very painfully obvious. There is a whole sequence

287
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,740
there gone that I don't even know if they ever got put it in with DLC or whatever.

288
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:14,500
Uh, and then the whole world of ruin at the end, like that could have been,

289
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:22,020
that could have been a upside down Castlevania moment for final fantasy. Truly. That could have

290
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,820
been an upside down, like, do y'all remember when Castlevania Symphony of the Night first came out

291
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,620
and you first realized that there was an upside down castle? Like if you beat the game the right

292
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,300
way and like, it's just like, Oh my God, my fucking mind just exploded because there's a

293
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,660
whole nother half of this game to go. Basically final fantasy 15 could have had that and was set

294
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,540
up for that. And maybe they finally saw it in the DLC. I don't know because I didn't pay attention

295
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,900
that long. And it's very disappointing that it wasn't realized in what they released. But again,

296
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,300
it's because they really only had two years to actually develop the game. Yes. It was in

297
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,980
development for 10 years. Nah, nah, they hit the reset button. Like with two years to go,

298
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,540
maybe three. Anyway, sorry, Loki. I have a lot of tangents tonight.

299
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,300
It's okay. I have to make up for Jamie not being here.

300
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:16,100
And then of course, probably the last major thing that they announced as well as Street Fighter VI,

301
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,140
they showed off a new trailer with that. So it was less of a teaser trailer, more of like an

302
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,620
actual showing gameplay and stuff. And so a lot of interesting things that we saw from that one,

303
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,380
they're going to have a single player open world type of gameplay that's in there,

304
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:35,060
which is interesting. They also showed off some new characters as well. So we got to see,

305
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:42,900
of course, you know, some of the staples like Ryu and Chun-Li were in there. And then I can't

306
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:52,100
remember the two other new ones. Was it Jamie and Kimberly, maybe? I don't remember who the

307
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,780
other ones are, but so they showed those off. And then of course, it all leaked.

308
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:05,940
All the roster leaked. So there is a screenshot or image, I guess, that had...

309
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,900
Chat once to let you know Jamie and Luke were in the trailer.

310
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,620
Jamie and Luke. Okay.

311
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,700
Kimberly is from this other piece you're talking about.

312
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,900
Got it. I couldn't remember what the names were of the different characters. But yeah,

313
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,060
so we got the basically looks like the full roster from the game. So a lot of the

314
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,620
previous characters coming back with like, definitely like some updated looks and stuff.

315
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:34,500
So you know, we got like Chun-Li looks like Guile, Blanca, Yhonda, Dalzim, Zangief, Ken.

316
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,540
But all you need to know is Ryu is daddy now. That's all you need to know. I mean,

317
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,420
and he's already been announced. And you already know he's daddy.

318
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,980
I feel like the Ken redesign. I think that looks great. And like Dalzim looks great.

319
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,180
He's like much older now.

320
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,900
Street Fighter is very much destined for the Star Trek legacy where the even numbered ones

321
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,060
are the good ones. Like Street Fighter is very much headed for that legacy, isn't it?

322
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,940
I don't know. And then they have what looks like DJs back, which is cool.

323
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,460
That's cool too. DJs back.

324
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,300
And then they have some actual new characters that look pretty interesting as well.

325
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,940
So I like to see. I like to see that. I mean, I think it looks like

326
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,180
Mike Defton chat says Ken looks like he bought some NFTs and he's going through some tough shit.

327
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:28,100
No, was that the one I saw was great was like it was Ken looks like that when you have the

328
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,260
conversation. Oh, you have children. Well, the wife took children. There's something like that.

329
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:40,500
He has that kind of Bobby Blackwell says is Faye Long calling back to a reference a few weeks ago?

330
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,500
Well, you know, what didn't leak is DLC. And I'm sure there will be plenty. Oh, yeah. And so,

331
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,460
you know, I'm well aware of that story from a few weeks ago where the composer guy maybe

332
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,580
opened the door a little too much on his YouTube thing and maybe put his foot in his mouth a little

333
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:06,660
too much. So maybe, maybe Faye Long is released out of pure spite as DLC. Spike can be extremely

334
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,180
motivating, but I love Faye Long. I'd be all for it comes out of spite.

335
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,380
Pure spite DLC.

336
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,900
Yeah. That's funny.

337
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:20,900
Quest Busters sum this up, I believe really well saying so one of the takes I saw about the leaks

338
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,340
is that yes, the leaks were bad. But the general sentiment about what has been seen has been really

339
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:32,100
exciting. And I'll sign on with that is that yeah, that fucking sucks for Capcom, because you

340
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,100
know, they were going to milk these character announcements right up until the game releases,

341
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,060
and they were probably going to unveil someone else at summer game fest this week. So you know

342
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:47,060
what, and they still could, you know, it's not like they can't just show deeper dive, deeper dives,

343
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:53,860
the ultimates backstory, show them in the story mode that still has a lot of question marks,

344
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,100
the open world stuff they're showing. I think there's still ways they can do that and make it

345
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,060
exciting. But yeah, it's kind of like, wow, that sucks for them that it leaked out. But actually,

346
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:09,460
like, I can't think of what could get people more excited about Street Fighter six, because the

347
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:16,340
designs are so good. When all anyone was talking about after that first trailer was the the stock

348
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:22,420
logo thing and now which they changed the logo. I think the logo looks much better. It's great.

349
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,380
So at least they heard. Wow. It's like, everybody saw what happened after the first Sonic the

350
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,860
Hedgehog movie trailer. And now they're like, maybe we should fix mistakes that the internet

351
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:38,980
points out. That worked very well for Sonic will stuff that like, yeah, it's like, very obvious.

352
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,620
But like, yeah, it's definitely I just like the whole Roman numeral six that rotates like that

353
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,660
was very clever. Very clever. It is clever, much more clever than, you know, stock photo stuff.

354
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:56,260
Great. So yeah, looks exciting. Yeah, we'll have to see more.

355
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,940
Yeah, I still want to see more of the game, which I'm gonna be honest, I think I downloaded Street

356
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:06,420
Fighter five as like a PS plus. I played it maybe one time and I was like meh. But like, so I'm like,

357
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,620
way more enthused with what I'm seeing of Street Fighter six so far. Again, these characters again,

358
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:20,340
real hot. Really? Like, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry to gay it up, but I'm not happy, right? Like,

359
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:31,220
there's like real hot. If you're gonna cosplay Daddy Ryu, call me like, it's this is Yeah. Anyway,

360
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:38,180
but all the characters look really good in those those leaks, you know? So yeah, it's very exciting.

361
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,780
For sure. Even the new characters, you know, they all looked the ones I was looking at

362
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,300
would look really cool. So yeah. And of course, they had to be pointed out by

363
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,580
the horn dogs on the internet that Chung Li now has butt physics as well. So, you know,

364
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:59,380
keeping realistic, or keeping the realism. All right, cool. Cool story. But yeah, it's not just

365
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,420
an instead the chat is saying, you know, down boy down the thirst is strong. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But

366
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:09,620
the reality is, like, I'm just excited to see some of these like, like character reinventions,

367
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:14,260
like seeing DJ back, I think is super cool. Because like, has DJ been in Street Fighter since?

368
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,540
I guess he must have shown up in four eventually, because four had like, literally everybody at one

369
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,980
point. But like, I feel like, you know, he's been gone for a while. And, you know, just some of

370
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,740
these other characters coming back, because he Honda was always my favorite in the original Street

371
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,260
Fighter two, because I would just do his hundred hand slap over and over. And he looks really

372
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:39,700
different. And that's pretty cool. So yeah, love it. Yeah. Tiger class says, so Chun Li now has a

373
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:47,300
thick butt to go with those thighs. Sure. All right. All right. Yeah, sure. All right. Let's

374
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:53,620
move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks, and the types of games that we've been playing this

375
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,500
week as we sit on our thick butts and play some video games. Loki, how was your gaming week?

376
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,580
Um, it's all Minecraft again. I mean, it's always,

377
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,220
but you had a new video. So we know it's productive.

378
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:11,940
Yes, it's always very busy to that, like video took at least like, 10 hours to edit. So there

379
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:17,540
was a lot to go through trying to whittle it down to even the 40 minutes that it is, because they

380
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:23,380
keep getting longer. But like I, it's pretty concise now, or at least trying to get a concise,

381
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:29,540
but there's a lot to show. So yeah, that just came out. And then I did want to update since

382
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:36,660
it's over now the bundle for the top and I got distracted. Yeah, yeah. Yes. So we've raised

383
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:46,100
$2,809. Not hundreds of thousands of dollars, but it's only 30 games. So it's all good. But yeah,

384
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,060
so in a couple weeks, I'll be donated. I know that the guy Nate Peters, who's in charge of

385
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:56,740
everything he's I guess there's you much like steam and everything you have to wait for like

386
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:02,980
seven days for refunds not to be issued and seven more days for like payments to be issued and stuff.

387
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:08,340
So he's taking care of all of the depositing for that stuff. But yeah, lots of bundles being sold

388
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:18,180
and notifications going off like crazy on on each IO. So I think we sold probably like at least 150

389
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:26,260
of those bundles. That's great. Congratulations. Yeah. Awesome. All right, that's it. Great.

390
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,700
Let's see. So for my gaming week, so I played Mario Fantasy 14, because of course I did,

391
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:38,260
I always play that game. I also did, you know, my AR games, I was doing an event in Ingress,

392
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,100
and I actually went all the way to the gold level. So it took a little bit of walking and doing all

393
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,860
that stuff. But I had fun with that. Been walking my Pikmin, I'm almost to level 59 in Pikmin Bloom.

394
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:54,420
And I played Pokemon go because this weekend was the big Pokemon go fest, right, the the annual

395
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:59,140
festival, which went global in the year 2020 for obvious reasons, but they had, you know, pretty

396
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:04,500
good success with the global event in 2020. Last year was a $5 event that was pretty well received

397
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:10,260
for the price. This year, the price went back up to $15. And, you know, I was looking at like,

398
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,660
what all they were doing. And I was like, Well, I feel like I have a lot of these Pokemon, there's

399
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:19,780
maybe only like one truly new one in this event for me. And I'm I don't know, whatever, I'll do

400
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:27,700
it. And so I bought a ticket for the event. And I regret it. This event was trash. This event was

401
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,980
trash. I should say I should say this event was not worth what Niantic charged for it,

402
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,420
especially coming off of the $5 price tag last year, which I understand was a tie in to the

403
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:46,580
fifth anniversary. But that's, you know what, this event was worth maybe $5. I can't fucking

404
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:54,340
believe that I walked nine miles yesterday, and got six shinies from that. Whereas last year,

405
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:01,780
when I went to San Francisco, I maybe walked six or seven miles. And I think I ended the day with

406
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:08,580
like 23 shinies. Now, it doesn't have to be all about shinies. But they are desirable. Well,

407
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,620
unless you're Shane, but if they are desirable, they are nice, they are fun to collect,

408
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:18,180
they are a more advanced part of the game to collect, they're a rarer thing. And I just,

409
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:26,580
what pisses me off is that Niantic was really dangling the carrot of, well, Axew's going shiny,

410
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,580
and there's unknowns that are going to be shiny. And there's all these things that are going to be

411
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:39,380
shiny for the event. You know what, I think Niantic broke loot box laws, quite frankly,

412
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,100
with that because they need to disclose, especially because they were selling us,

413
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:49,220
they need to disclose what was really the percentage there of shinies. And maybe it's

414
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:54,500
confirmation bias because I didn't get as many shinies. But looking around on social media and

415
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,220
stuff, I don't think a lot of people did walk out of that event with a lot of shinies. Thank you,

416
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:04,660
Def says six yesterday, three today on the shinies. Oh, I got one today on a three mile walk.

417
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:09,860
And they're shitty shinies too. I'm sorry, but they are because they, like, at least three of

418
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:16,980
them that I got were previous community day shinies. Like I got CDot, WooHoo. I got Shviel,

419
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,940
which was also a previous community day. So it was like, it was just very frustrating. At least

420
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,580
I finally got a Wingull. I do like shiny Wingull, but it's not exactly an A tier shiny either.

421
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:33,220
Okay, so it doesn't have to just be about shinies. Fine. They put Axew in one star raids,

422
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,540
which was cool. It was nice to see that. I wish maybe they'd put some of the other like that

423
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:44,180
Jango. Oh, Jango. Oh, whatever that name should have probably been a one stars as well. And maybe

424
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,500
a couple of the other really hard to get like one stars that needed not a lot of candy. Maybe Noi

425
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:54,740
Bat would have been great to see in raids. I just think the raids were super underwhelming. And what

426
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:00,740
the fuck were the Alolan Pokemon doing in the rotation from hour to hour when we just had an

427
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:07,860
event focused on them? Like it's just, it's for free. Yeah. SG100Matt says I don't want to sound

428
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,500
like I should expect anything but considering we spent $15 they could have had better rates than

429
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:19,860
this. I think when you spend $15 you can expect to get $15 worth. And this event was not worth $15.

430
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,860
Now I guess they put another new Pokemon in raids today. You didn't need a raid ticket to get it.

431
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:30,020
In fact, you didn't need a raid ticket for the Axew's either. What did the raid ticket holders

432
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:37,620
really get out of this? Maybe more unknowns, Torkoal and Tropius. A couple of regionals

433
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,060
that I bet most people that didn't do the event will just trade for anyway.

434
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:50,820
I mean, what did the $15 really get us? Not much. Oh, yeah, the incense rules. They did take

435
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,220
so Chas reminded the incense rules changed over the weekend back to what they were before

436
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,700
basically. And yeah, things would constantly just spawn. Oh, that was so annoying. Like I

437
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,420
would be like, Oh, because I really, really wanted more shiny unknowns. That's the one thing I really

438
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,540
wanted was more shiny unknowns. I would see an unknown spawn, I tap it, it would disappear.

439
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:15,300
Thanks to some stupid bug that was going on in the game. So just it was it was a shitty event

440
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:21,460
and Niantic should feel bad for charging $15 for that. Now, I guess there is something about

441
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:26,500
there's a second half of the event coming in August. So there's supposed to be like an encore

442
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:32,900
event in August. August better fucking blow me away after this weekend. So I don't know what

443
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:38,420
they're saving up for. But it better knock my fucking socks off after this release. Because

444
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,660
yeah, it's it's really making me reconsider buying into the hype in the future. And I feel

445
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:49,140
really stupid for having done it this time to be quite honest. Speaking of things I feel stupid for

446
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,140
I wasn't sure if I was going to mention this on the show or not, but I'm gonna I'm gonna say

447
00:39:53,860 --> 00:40:00,660
I did a thing that I said before I didn't think I was gonna do. I played Diablo mortal.

448
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:11,300
I know. Why did I do it? I Well, I've always loved Diablo. Be the other situation with what's

449
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:16,740
going on at Blizzard and everything is really complicated. I we all we all know very much how

450
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,500
I feel about Bobby Kotick and I feel about a lot of the management over at Activision Blizzard.

451
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:29,940
That hasn't changed. I know people, people as in more than one that had involvement with this game.

452
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:36,900
And where do you kind of draw the line between? I want to support you even though I fucking can't

453
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,180
stand your boss. It's like where where do you draw the line? So at the end of the day, I was like,

454
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,100
you know what, and and actually, and I will say this, I'm gonna say this to Diablo immortals

455
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:55,300
credit, huge credit is after that whole debacle at E or sorry, not E3 Blizzcon. In 2017, or whenever

456
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,260
it was that they announced was 18. I don't remember anymore whenever they announced that game

457
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,780
with the whole don't you all have phones. They did backtrack at the end of the day,

458
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:10,020
and they put the game out on PC as well, stating, if we don't do this, people are just going to use

459
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:15,060
Android emulators to play the game. So we might as well just put out an official version of this

460
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:23,220
on PC. I think that was a very accurate and very perceptive and very welcomed change in thinking.

461
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:31,300
And I want to support a change in thinking. So I did I did not download the phone version,

462
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,180
I downloaded the PC version. And I played that and spend any money on it. I'm not necessarily

463
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:41,540
wearing that as a badge of honor. It's just I and yet I am. I am, folks, I am well aware of

464
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:47,300
that copy pasted headline about you can spend $110,000 in Diablo immortal to max out your

465
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,300
character. And I think we have a story up coming up on it later. So I'm not gonna get too far into

466
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:57,540
that. For me so far, in my experience, it has been very easy to just not buy anything at all

467
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:02,580
and focus on the main scenario. Am I going to have the strongest character and the strongest weapons?

468
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:09,220
No. Is that going to bother me? No. And I just have to make sure it doesn't bother me. And that

469
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:15,300
I'm okay with not being the very best that no one ever was. That's Pokemon. And that's where I do

470
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,580
get suckered into spending money where maybe I shouldn't have. But um, yeah, Diablo immortal.

471
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:26,340
It's fine enough. I've played up to level like 25. And it actually has kind of like a fully fleshed

472
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,620
out main scenario quest that has like voice acting. It's like not just about like the grind

473
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:39,780
of rifts and so forth. So I was just I, I'm, I kind of wish and I maybe they'll regret to maybe

474
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:45,940
do this later. I don't know. I think if they had just put this out as a $40 PC game without the

475
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:51,060
micro transaction stuff, I almost wonder how much better this would have been received. If they just

476
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:58,020
put it out as a $40 PC game, where hey, when you buy it, you get a code to put it on your phone

477
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:02,980
as well. So it can be both phone and that stuff. I wonder how much better received this whole thing

478
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,540
would have been if that was the route they went. But I know I know I know. That's not business,

479
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:12,980
Rob. That's not how EA makes their money. That's not your loot boxes are where Yeah, yeah, yeah,

480
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:18,020
I get it. I get it. I'm just saying, maybe this whole thing would have got a lot less shit.

481
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:24,180
And maybe as a result, make more money in the long run. If that was the route they went,

482
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:29,700
and who's to say they won't still end up going that route. Especially with Microsoft now in the

483
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:35,380
picture. I wonder what game pass perks I'm going to get for Diablo immortal eventually, maybe a

484
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:42,180
year from now. We'll see. Questbuster and chat says Diablo mortals PC client is still a bit jank,

485
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,740
but it works well enough, at least in my case. Yeah, I agree. Some of the loading times are

486
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,820
pretty shit. Maybe that's because I'm not running it off a solid state drive. I don't know. Or maybe

487
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:56,500
it is literally an Android emulator. I don't know. But it's not terrible. And you can use a gamepad.

488
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,060
I just I use keyboard mouse because like Diablo, I just feel like that's the way to play it.

489
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:06,180
Questbuster also says, I played through the entire campaign and unlocked paragon.

490
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,940
The monetization doesn't really feel as if it hurts until I got to that point.

491
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:16,820
S2100 Matt says considering this closed out of Blizzcon one year and was billed as a big deal.

492
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,900
Now it's a loot box nonsense thing that's kind of hurt the franchise to some degree.

493
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,940
Here's the weird thing about that. Again, I want to say I've been playing this game for a few hours

494
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:33,860
and have easily been able to ignore all these loot box mechanics. And Questbuster just told you,

495
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,420
I went through the entire campaign and unlock Paragon. And that's when I started

496
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,660
feeling the loot box stuff. Yeah, because you unlock the loot box stuff.

497
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,460
Like they they don't start offering it to you until you get further in the game.

498
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:53,220
Not all of it like those legendary crest crest. I have access to him now. And the game tried to

499
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:58,580
push a 99 cent first timer bundle on me and other stuff, but it's very easy to say no.

500
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:07,300
So I don't know. So yeah, my feelings on Diablo Immortal are a bit complicated, but I do feel

501
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:15,460
the $110,000 headline is a little, I can't believe I'm going to say this. I think that

502
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:21,620
headline is a little unfair. But I do think, and the reason why I say that is that you don't have

503
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,260
to upgrade every legendary gem because they don't all make sense for all the classes.

504
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:33,140
But I understand the desire to drag Activision Blizzard for a lot of this loot box nonsense when

505
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:39,140
it could have just been a $40 game. And I think we would all be speaking very differently of this

506
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:45,060
game if it was just a $40 game on PC that happened to be on mobile phones as well. So that part I'm

507
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:52,420
absolutely going to agree with. But I do think that $110,000 figure that's being copy pasted

508
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:59,940
is a little bit like, I think you're kind of, you're kind of stating a scenario that's not

509
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:05,780
really going to happen to anyone. But I don't know. Then again, I'm not a high streamer that's,

510
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,580
or high rank streamer who's maybe high as well. I don't know. I'm not a high rank streamer who's

511
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:14,260
willing to drop $500 on a stream because that's how much money they're making in bits and subs

512
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:20,820
during a stream anyway. So I don't know. Anyway. Questbuster says it's so easy to ignore the

513
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,300
monetization, but when you want to perfect your gear post campaign, it feels like they've heavily

514
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,700
targeted that. So you have to be able to say, I don't need to be perfect. And I'm just going to

515
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:36,980
play this for fun is the impression I get. Anyway. So that's my thoughts on that. Let's move on.

516
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:41,700
Let's talk about what else is going on in the gaming world this week with some headlines.

517
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,700
And, uh, Sony, not the only one to put out a little video this week, right? Logie?

518
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:53,300
Uh, that's correct. Yeah. So there's a cool announcement with, uh, the mega drive mini two.

519
00:46:54,100 --> 00:47:00,260
It's, um, it's interesting. They have quite a few games in there. I like how that they have

520
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:04,420
all these mini systems that can, that you can actually stack them together. So they had

521
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:13,380
previously like a mini 32 X and, uh, was it the mini? Um, I'm not sure what they have,

522
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,820
like a other separate, I know you can get a Sega CD attachment to it as well. Um, but yeah,

523
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:25,060
this new mega drive two mini has gonna only be available in Japan right now. It's going to run

524
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:30,340
you 4,500 yen and they've got some of the game. I think some of the games have been announced for

525
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:39,780
this so far. So we've got, it looks like, um, was it silphied, uh, sonic CD, uh, shiny for CD.

526
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:47,540
Uh, it looks like we've got Virtua racing, uh, but it ends up brothers thunder forest for,

527
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,380
uh, it looks like fantasy zone. Jamie would be very excited about that.

528
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:58,180
Which is interesting because that wasn't even on the Genesis. That was a master system game.

529
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:03,380
Right. These are, these are, so, uh, this is a mega drive cartridge and so there's,

530
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,380
uh, mega drive cartridge and mega CD games kind of mixed together.

531
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,660
Yeah, but it wasn't, it wasn't even on Genesis. Like it was, so I, I think this must be a prototype

532
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,780
that they had at one point that they fully realized. I don't know, but it's just,

533
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,620
it's just interesting. It's an interesting addition.

534
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:23,540
Yeah. I think it's like their redesign, uh, console, like, you know how, like the Genesis

535
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:28,980
are eventually kind of, you know, they, they changed the design of it a little bit.

536
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,540
So it's like this, and then of course this has the six button controller that they

537
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,500
got on that system much later as well. So pretty cool.

538
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:43,620
Jamie was here tonight because these are a lot of these are games. She's probably featured half

539
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,700
these games as classic games a week. And, you know, she, uh, is very passionate about the old

540
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,540
Sega stuff. So I'll have to ask her thoughts on that next week. But, um, even I, as a,

541
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:56,420
who is always more a Nintendo household and kind of missed the Sega CD and all that stuff,

542
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,740
like there's a lot of stuff in here where even I'm like,

543
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,900
damn, I kind of want to get this. It sounds like a great lineup.

544
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:07,540
Yeah. So it's supposed to come with 50 games. So obviously they haven't announced all of the games

545
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:13,860
that are going to be in it. Um, and then along with that though, they added, um, I think though

546
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,780
they're talking about, yeah, they're just talking about basically the Sega CD, how there's enhanced

547
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:23,460
graphics and stuff. So going to be, you know, USB powered HDMI, that type of stuff. So, um,

548
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,740
pretty cool looking though. Yeah.

549
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,740
I want one. Hopefully I can get one. Hopefully they're not too hard to get. Um,

550
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:35,700
a lot of people were curious why they weren't doing a Dreamcast mini or a Saturn mini,

551
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,060
but I guess they came out and said it would have been too expensive in light of, you know,

552
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:44,660
the chip shortage going on in the world or whatever. I'm a little surprised at that. Yeah.

553
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:49,700
I'm hoping maybe they're just saving that for maybe another year or two or whatever. Um, and,

554
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,780
and we'll see that eventually. I think that would be great, but this is, this is a pretty,

555
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:58,500
this is still a pretty decent lineup, you know, for stretching out the Genesis another year. Right.

556
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:04,100
So, yeah. So, yeah. And like I said, um, so the cost actually is a 99,

557
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:12,580
80 yen or about $75. The 4,500 yen was actually for a non-functional matching Sega CD add-on.

558
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:18,020
It's just cosmetic, but if you want to make your, your, uh, make it drive to look like

559
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:25,540
it's docked to a Sega CD, you can, and that even comes with like a tiny virtual racing cartridge

560
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:32,100
and a Sonic CD, Sonic the Hedgehog DD disc that goes into the CD drive, which is kind of funny.

561
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:37,860
Yeah. I think, I think, uh, I think this thing will be cute. I want, I hope they bring it over

562
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,860
here. I know it's Japan only right now, but, um, maybe we'll hear in the next month that it's got,

563
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,740
I mean, maybe this is what Sega wants to talk about at Summer Game Fest. I don't know. Who

564
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:50,580
knows? We'll see. Yeah. All right. Well back to Diablo Immortal talk for a minute because Diablo

565
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,420
Immortal has been in the headlines, um, in a lot of places, not just that headline I was talking

566
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,620
about with, um, how much it costs to max up a character. Um, but, uh, about where Diablo

567
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:04,180
Immortal is not releasing, and that is Belgium or the Netherlands. Uh, these countries are not

568
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:10,980
getting Diablo Immortal. Um, and, uh, it's probably because of local laws pertaining to loot boxes.

569
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:19,300
Uh, and, uh, Blizzard not really looking to change that. Um, so on the Diablo Immortal subreddit,

570
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,860
a Blizzard game master kind of set, and they obviously they're not naming names for reasons,

571
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,700
kind of said, like what's going on with this saying, quote, the loot boxes in the game are

572
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,580
against the law in your country. So unless the gambling restrictions change, the game will not

573
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:36,980
be released in the Netherlands and Belgium. Um, and this is probably because, you know, again,

574
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:41,540
you can buy a greater rift key or whatever the hell they call it, legendary rift modifier key,

575
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,140
whatever it's called in that game. Um, you can buy that, but it doesn't really guarantee that

576
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:49,700
you're going to get anything. It just ups the odds on a lot of stuff, which I kind of, I kind

577
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:54,340
of think is a bullshit thing to begin with, but, um, is it any different than Pokemon go? Clearly

578
00:51:54,340 --> 00:52:00,740
not. Um, so, uh, this is where we're at. So, um, yeah, it's not going to be released in those

579
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,060
countries for those reasons. I think there probably should be more transparency in all

580
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,460
countries, uh, on Blizzard's part with this, to be quite honest, and with all gaming companies,

581
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:16,580
I think odds and that sort of thing should be a default thing. Like why the odds should be very

582
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:27,460
clear from, in everything. Um, but yeah. So the games are of the mindset. Don't tell me the odds.

583
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:32,420
So, you know, that's true. Yeah. If you, if you know the, uh, but the other thing that Diablo

584
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:38,820
like, there are just so many items that do different things. And it's like, you have

585
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:44,740
your pay to win currency that can buy so many items. I've heard this called the hot dogs in

586
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:50,740
the bun thing before. And it's very true, but like, it goes beyond the fact that like, you know,

587
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:57,220
six or $5 will get you 600 of this, but which really translates to four of these, you know,

588
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,980
it's just like the math really gets convoluted, um, in that game. And that's why I've just said,

589
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,420
you know what, I'm just never going to give this game my credit card info. And the nice

590
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:13,780
thing about it being on a PC standalone client, they don't have it. So I can't spend money.

591
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:18,420
They have my old, the guess what the credit card Blizzard has on file for when I did pay for wow,

592
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,580
many years ago, that card expired. So they don't have any credit card for me right now. So

593
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,940
there you go. All right, what else do we have? Loki?

594
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:33,700
All right. And so we talked about this last week about how Microsoft said they would acknowledge

595
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:41,700
the raven software union that they had there for the QA department, but now they wanted to

596
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:48,740
go a little bit further with that. This is a comment now from Brad Smith with Microsoft

597
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:57,540
saying that not only are they going to acknowledge the current union, but any unions going forward,

598
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:05,700
they're going to acknowledge those as well, or recognize those, I should say not necessarily

599
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:10,420
acknowledge. Breslin said, you know, our employees do not need to organize to have a dialogue with

600
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:15,220
Microsoft leaders. But we also recognize the workplace is changing. That's why we are sharing

601
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:22,980
principles to guide our approach with labor organizations. And then they link to all that.

602
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:32,020
So at least that's better than, you know, Activision Blizzard trying to stamp out unions.

603
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:37,700
Well, and I think Microsoft also sees that this is something they can get ahead of and just accept

604
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,780
as where the industry kind of read the tea leaves and see that this is where the industry is going

605
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:46,100
to be going. And either they can, you know, get on board and try to get ahead of it and

606
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,140
try to figure out what it means for them and how can they get they can best work with that,

607
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:54,580
or they can kick and scream and just look dumb, you know, like a lot of other companies are at

608
00:54:54,580 --> 00:55:00,500
this point. So, you know, kudos to Microsoft for continuing to get it. And Phil Spencer,

609
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:05,380
specifically, to be honest. So, boy, it's going to be interesting if he ever leaves.

610
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,700
Not that I wish that but you know, it's just going to be it's going to be very interesting,

611
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,420
you know, heaven forbid Microsoft get another Don Mattrick in there. It's just it's so interesting

612
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:18,500
how who's at the top can really trickle down into the rest of the culture, huh?

613
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:24,580
Yeah, as to 100. Matt, agreeing with me in chat, saying times are changing,

614
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:29,460
the industry is going, it's either they get in front of it and support it as best as possible,

615
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:35,540
or be the jerk and try to suppress it. DJ Romas says, granted, the MS retail stores could be

616
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:42,660
unionized. But on the corporate side, not really no. So well, you know, like a lot of retail

617
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:47,220
efforts to unionize as well, you know, look at what's going on with Starbucks and all that. So

618
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:53,620
we'll see. Anyway, let's move on to another big gaming headline from this week and another video

619
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:58,580
announcement. And that has to do with Pokemon Scarlet and violet. That's right, we got a new

620
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:03,380
trailer for Pokemon Scarlet and violet this week. And it was just a few minutes. But boy,

621
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:09,380
do they cram a lot into those few minutes. For example, we got to see that there are not one but

622
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:15,220
two new professors because it depends on which version of the game you pick up. So yeah, Professor

623
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:20,580
Sada, and you have Professor Turo. And again, it depends which version of the game you pick up

624
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:28,580
which one you're going to get. Professor Sada is kind of like a prehistoric Lee dressed female

625
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:33,380
professor, kind of like Laura Dern in Jurassic Park. Why don't we just say she's Laura Dern in

626
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:39,540
Jurassic Park basically. And then Professor Turo is a male character that looks like Tron

627
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:45,860
a little bit. So like we'll say, you know, Garrett, what's his name and Tron. So so there's,

628
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:51,140
there's, it's interesting that you have prehistoric and you have Tron, it kind of makes

629
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:56,740
it look like there's a past and a future sort of storyline that's going on here. I should also point

630
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:01,620
out that the internet has decided both of these professors are hot. And if you're bisexual,

631
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:07,700
you're having a really good week, because both of these professors are quite bangable. According to

632
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:16,180
the world of fan art. I'm just, Loki, I'm just gonna say, I've seen some art about Professor

633
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:22,180
Turo already. It's, it's amazing what the internet can do in six hours, but at the same time,

634
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:27,940
not surprising whatsoever. But I'm just gonna say Pokemon anymore. It's just thirst them on.

635
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:34,500
Yeah, that's definitely people want to be poked. I've just that's what I've got to say. Because

636
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:40,580
people have their fan images already. And you know, if you thought Ryu was a daddy,

637
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:47,620
wait, it's almost like I saw the best. The best picture I saw was a clip. It said it had Professor

638
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:55,700
Turo. But the chat box the text was taken out to instead put in Hi, gay. I don't know if you've

639
00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:01,700
ever seen that Twitter thing. Hi, gay. Come on down to the butter shop. And it's so fucking

640
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:11,700
funny. Loki. I'm telling you, it's really funny. All right. All right. Let's see. DJ Rama says

641
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:17,300
future Professor Turo cosplay. I'm flattered that you think I could even pull it off. I'm

642
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:22,660
truly flattered. Maybe. Who knows DragonCon. I bet there will be lots of that cosplay at

643
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:29,700
DragonCon. And I'm a okay for that. So anyway. Oh, yes, we need what else was in the trailer

644
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:36,660
besides thirsty professors. We got to see just a little bit of your rival in that game. We saw that

645
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,940
there is a interesting connect with your friends and you can go out on adventures together up to

646
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:47,540
four people at a time. So it actually has like multiplayer gameplay in there for like trading

647
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:52,100
and battling, but also exploring with other players, which is interesting. So it's almost

648
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:58,900
like they ironically coming off of talking about Diablo. It almost sounds like they kind of have

649
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:03,380
that spin on it, which I think will be very interesting to see, quite frankly, so I'm excited

650
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:10,340
to see that. And then there are some old Pokemon that have been confirmed. So Gengar, Talonflame,

651
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:19,620
Chewtle, Venonat, Cryogonal, Larvitar, Bagon, Pikachu, Toxapex, Coalossal. So we don't know

652
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:26,180
if the Scarlet Violet decks will have everything because we know how the internet got really upset

653
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:30,500
when Pokemon Sword and Shield didn't have everything. So we don't know if we're going to

654
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:35,140
see that this time, but we did get to see some other new Pokemon, including, yes,

655
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:44,180
a cute little pig Pokemon named Lechonk. Now, while most of us are taking that to mean haha

656
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:51,060
chonk, lechonk haha. Many people are also pointed out that like Mike Defton in our chat says,

657
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:56,500
also Lechonk's name comes from Lechon. I don't know if I'm saying that right, which is literally

658
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:03,300
pig in Spanish. So yes, there are probably some very tongue in cheek sort of things there in the

659
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:08,660
like, I heard Professor Turo could have come from Futuro as well, which is like a way of saying

660
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:16,580
future. There's also a new Pokemon Pomi, which is like a little electric dog or something that

661
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:23,220
looked really cute. And I'm sorry, I loved Smallive, which yes, was a little olive that

662
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:34,180
was small. It's adorable. Smallive. S-M-O-L-I-V. Smallive. Anyway, yeah, so I think it looked

663
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:40,020
super cute. I'm really excited to get my hands on this game. So and I'm not even Shane or generally

664
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:44,180
one that like gets super excitable about Pokemon, but I enjoyed my time with Sword and Shield and

665
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:51,380
I'm excited for this one as well. Zenmonkey11 says, this game sounds like there isn't going

666
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:57,940
to be much to do offline, which sucks. I don't think the multiplayer was required by any means.

667
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:05,700
And if you think about it, there was in Sword and Shield, you had those raids,

668
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:12,500
which was up to four people, right? But if you didn't have online people, you would get really

669
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:19,940
terrible NPCs that never did the right move. So if you want to put up with that you sure can.

670
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:25,380
Yeah, so single player I think will be fine. You'll still have a story to get through,

671
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:30,420
start to finish. It's just multiplayer is just another way you could do it. And maybe will be

672
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:36,020
a way to get better things. Now I'm curious how it's going to work. Will Scarlet and Violet

673
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:42,340
be playable together multiplayer? And how does that work if you're getting different Pokemon?

674
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:48,580
So I'm curious how that all plays out. Like can I play Scarlet and Mike Deft play Violet,

675
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:53,460
then we can play together even though like every gay I know wants to get Pokemon Violet now for

676
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:58,820
obvious reasons. I feel like I want to get Scarlet just so I have people to trade with.

677
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:05,860
Plus I like I like Sada. I thought I think she's a neat design. So I don't have to thirst after all

678
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:14,660
my characters and video games. Just sometimes. All right. Moving on. S200Matt says Shane will play

679
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:20,340
both games at once with himself online. Absolutely true. He will allow his husband to play with him,

680
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,220
I'm pretty sure. But otherwise, yes. All right. Anyway, moving on. Loki.

681
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:34,260
So there's been some drama going on in the PC game collection. I'm seeing where apparently

682
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:42,020
on my internet, yes, drama. Apparently, there is a person by the name of Enrico Riccardi,

683
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:51,140
who had for years been counterfeiting a sealed box games in the PC market and selling them.

684
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:58,820
And so apparently now folks had started to pay attention to what he had sold them. And

685
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:03,300
they're finding that the other discs that are blank, there's I didn't mean to have the

686
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:09,780
sound effects behind you. Sorry. I'm setting up for another segment. There's stuff that they

687
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:16,980
could tell that were printed like on a dot matrix printer or something like that. There is autographs

688
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:27,380
that were forged. So it's, it's a mess as far as what has happened here. Even a couple of the games

689
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:34,260
had gone through Wada, that grading company, and they had graded them like a okay. Even though

690
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:41,300
they're fake. So Wada, of course, is like, Oh, hey, hey, we'll look at those again. But apparently,

691
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:50,500
they're saying that since 2015, he's roughly been involved with $107,000 worth of transactions.

692
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,580
I guess I did play appropriate noise for collectors getting scammed. So there is

693
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:04,180
that. So it was the game over noise and Mario. So anyway, because it's at the start of a video

694
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:11,220
for an upcoming segment here. But yeah, let's see. Mike deaf says I remember PSA grading a

695
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:17,780
fake Pokemon card with a 10. So yeah, that some some fakes are really convincing. So you got to

696
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:23,300
be care. I don't know. Like I, I would be very careful getting into this market right now.

697
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:29,940
Well, and considering though that like, with that, like, it's also hard to tell like,

698
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:35,860
when that stuff seal like, if you're not going to open up, see if the disc is legit or not,

699
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:41,540
you're looking at the box like, yeah, that's, you know, correct. I don't know. No, for sure.

700
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:49,060
I don't think I'll be buying any classics. Well, unless it's like a game I want to play for like

701
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:53,940
12 bucks on the shelf for 15 bucks, but not hundreds of thousands of dollars anytime soon.

702
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:58,020
That's for sure. Because the whole thing seems scammy. It's almost as scammy as NFTs.

703
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:03,540
So yeah. Anyway, let's get to it. Let's get to it. Let's go back to a time when

704
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,340
video games weren't so scammy.

705
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:22,100
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault

706
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:27,540
and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

707
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:34,580
Well, actually Dark Soccer, you won't be telling people about it tonight. I will. And the classic

708
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:42,180
game of the week that I've chosen tonight is Pitfall. Usually I will, I know Dark Soccer loves

709
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:47,700
to pick a game that came out like right at the cutoff, which is 10 years ago. So like a game

710
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:56,500
that's 10 years older or more. Pitfall, the game I've picked tonight is 40 years old. So here's

711
01:05:56,580 --> 01:06:01,620
the game. Yes, this game came out in August of 1982. So this is a 40 year old game that I've

712
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:06,340
picked. And Mike Defton chat says, or I'm sorry, also SEO in her matter, like really, we haven't

713
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:14,740
done Pitfall. I did Pitfall 2, the sequel a long time ago, like in the 400s somewhere along there,

714
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:20,740
one of the earlier classic games that I picked. But no, we have not discussed the original Pitfall,

715
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:26,260
or at least it's not on the wiki, in which case it didn't happen. So yeah, this is an

716
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:32,500
a lot of people of course, recognize this classic because this is a definitive 1982 classic game for

717
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:37,860
sure. This is a game that was created by Activision back when it was good, or at least published

718
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:43,700
Activision. The designer of this game, of course, was the famous David Crane, who was a really famous

719
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:49,140
designer because of games like Pitfall back in the 80s. In this game, of course, you are controlling

720
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:54,820
a character named Pitfall Harry was the character's name and he ended up kind of becoming a little bit

721
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:59,860
of a B-tier character later on. You saw him in other things and, you know, he was a mascot of

722
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:06,020
sorts for a certain time. You go through this world with basically an upstairs and a downstairs.

723
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:10,740
There's the overworld and there's the caves. And you can see both on the same screen. And there

724
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:18,100
are 255 screens that you're going through. Wow, it's two to the power of what, eight? So everything

725
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:22,660
is always two to the power of something in these old games, right? So 256 is that, you know, the

726
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:29,780
magic number. These screens are connected to the left and to the right. So some people may argue

727
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:34,420
it is easier to run to the left in this game. It all depends on how you want to play it.

728
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:41,220
The goal of this game is to collect treasure and run an entire loop through the game. You're

729
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:47,300
trying to get 32 treasures in the jungle in 20 minutes. It's harder than you think because you

730
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:53,300
have to use the caves underground in order to do it because the caves kind of move you ahead

731
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:58,740
by three screens each time. But sometimes that can lead you into a brick wall. So there are very

732
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:04,100
specific ways to kind of get through this game. The treasure bags, money, gold bars, silver bars,

733
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:11,860
diamond rings, and that all changes the points to it. A perfect score in this game is 114,000

734
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:17,060
points. That means you never get hit with a little rolling log or anything like that or fall

735
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:23,940
or your die or any of that stuff. So yeah, there is a way a specific way to run through this game

736
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:30,180
very fast. You have to use the underground tunnels to do it, of course. And this game was rereleased

737
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:36,900
a lot. This game was ported to a lot of different places in the 1980s. Because of course,

738
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:41,540
games back then were ported to a lot of things. So of course, most people know the Atari 2600

739
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:49,220
but it came out on Apple II, the Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, the MSX,

740
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:55,780
the Intellivision, and of course the place where I played this game mostly, which was,

741
01:08:55,780 --> 01:09:01,060
you guessed it, the Commodore 64. So let me switch the scene here for those watching live

742
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:08,020
to the Commodore 64 version, which was a little noisier because the jumping kind of made a

743
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:13,540
different noise. And the footsteps all made noise. And of course, it used the SID chip

744
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:20,180
there for the vine noise to make this very impressive stereo effect. But otherwise,

745
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:25,220
it pretty much was the same game that you would see on the 2600. Let me turn down the volume a

746
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,900
bit because the footsteps running by are going to be really annoying because it's constantly

747
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:36,420
throughout this Commodore 64 version of the game. David Crane, who made this game, said that in 1979,

748
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:43,140
he kind of made technology to display a running man. And in 1982, he wanted to use it in a game.

749
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:47,460
So that's where Pitfall came from. He says, I sat down with a blank sheet of paper and drew

750
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:52,740
a stick figure in the center. I said, okay, I have a little running man, and let's put him on a path.

751
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:57,940
Two more lines on the paper. Where is the path? It's a jungle. Why is he running? Treasures.

752
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:03,460
And Pitfall was born. This entire process took about 10 minutes, about 1000 hours of programming

753
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:10,020
later, the game was complete. And yeah, I think, you know, many people remember this game as like

754
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:16,340
a really early platforming game that they played and it sold very, very well, which was important

755
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:23,140
for a few reasons because it was not an Atari developed game. It was developed by a third party,

756
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:29,380
one that was very attractive to newer developers because and programmers because they credited

757
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:34,660
people with the game. Later versions of this game actually called it David Crane's Pitfall. So it

758
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:42,660
was very popular. This game sold 1 million units in five months. It was more popular than ET,

759
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:48,420
to put it in perspective for 1982, which is pretty sick. That's a very low bar to hit, but okay. It

760
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:55,060
is. But when you consider Atari spent $21 million for the ET license, and a third party got this

761
01:10:55,060 --> 01:11:01,780
one. Yeah, money well spent. Exactly. And people remember this game is one of the all time best.

762
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:07,060
The Arky Awards, which I've never heard of, but sure. Oh, it's because it was electronic games

763
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:13,140
magazine. Okay, it was a while ago. It got best adventure video game. Game Informer said this is

764
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:20,260
the 41st best game out of all time out of the top 100. But that was in 2001. So it was a while ago.

765
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:25,780
But in 2013, Entertainment Weekly said it was one of the 10 best Atari 2600 games. Okay,

766
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:29,620
I guess it's probably not a huge I mean, yeah, this is a hugely influential game.

767
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:34,900
And then of course sequels. I've talked about Pitfall to the Lost Caverns before.

768
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:38,980
It was a long time ago. So maybe you weren't listening to the show back when I did that.

769
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:43,620
But it's it's worth your time to check out because that was the first Atari 2600 game with a

770
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:50,820
soundtrack actually. And it was great on Commodore 64 as well. And they remade it into a game called

771
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:57,620
Super Pitfall for the Nintendo Entertainment System, which in my opinion was fucking garbage.

772
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:03,140
It's actually one of the worst NES games I've ever seen was Super Pitfall. So how dare they call it

773
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:09,060
a port of Pitfall to the Lost Caverns? Because it's terrible. They Loki they gave Pitfall Harry

774
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:16,500
a gun. And as cool as that sounds, it did not work. No, it did not. Anyway, later on, we got

775
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:20,660
Pitfall The Mayan Adventure for like Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. And they ported it

776
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:27,620
to a lot of places. Pitfall 3D Beyond the Jungle, where Bruce Campbell did Pitfall Harry Jr. You

777
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:32,100
know that that came out on the PlayStation. It was also out on the Game Boy Color. And then there was

778
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:36,980
another sequel called Pitfall The Lost Expedition. But let's be real, it by then the series it

779
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:41,300
evolved into something different. It wasn't really the same thing that we saw here. There

780
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:47,140
was a rerelease for iOS and Android. But it's not this game. It's a 3D endless runner and it came

781
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:54,020
out in 2012 when those were really huge. I didn't know this. David Crane did a Kickstarter for a

782
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:59,700
game called Jungle Venture, which was to be a spiritual successor to the original games.

783
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:05,380
He was trying to raise $900,000 to create Jungle Venture. Do you know how much he raised?

784
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:15,140
$31,000. So it was pretty bad. And on reflection, David Crane said, you know what? People thought

785
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:19,220
he was asking for too much. And everyone turned against him as soon as they saw the cost.

786
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:26,420
And it was a bad time. There's been too many Kickstarters of that price that have gone sour.

787
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:36,340
And I think it's just, yeah. Anyway, Pitfall also showed up on the CBS Saturday Supercade

788
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:43,300
with Pitfall Harry. Robert Wrigley voiced Harry. And Rhonda, the niece, was in the animated series

789
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:49,060
as well. She's in the sequel, as well as Quick Claw, the lion. So they were all in that. But

790
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:54,660
then Pitfall Harry got replaced by Kangaroo and Space Ace in later seasons. So it wasn't around

791
01:13:54,660 --> 01:14:02,100
very long. Also interesting, an abbreviated version of Pitfall is in the game Gary Kitchen's

792
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:08,660
Game Maker, which was a Commodore 64, Apple II, and IBM PC released in 1985. That's kind of

793
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:15,060
interesting. And Pitfall is, of course, referenced in the movie Ready Player One as one of the only

794
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:21,380
2,600 games that still hasn't ended. And there were clones. When you have popular games, people

795
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:27,300
make clones. Trapfall for the TRS-80 and Cuthbert in the Jungle for the Dragon 32.

796
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,540
Do you remember this game, Logie? Pitfall? Did you play this?

797
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,020
Yes, I played it on the Atari 2600.

798
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,540
It's a good game, huh?

799
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,500
Yes, it was one of my favorites.

800
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,000
Yeah.

801
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:40,820
Certainly was an ET.

802
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:46,500
Yeah, for sure. Let's see. Shehulk in chat says, Pitfall is a great game.

803
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:52,180
Bit.Trip Runner is a great homage game to Pitfall. You know, I never thought about that,

804
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:59,540
but you're right. I mean, I don't know if you can say Pitfall invented the side scroller platformer,

805
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:05,060
but it certainly showed that they could be popular. Because again, this sold a million

806
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:10,580
copies, and we didn't have a game like this on the Atari 2600 yet. Some folks in chat are thinking

807
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:14,020
about what might a remake, you know, what if Jungle Venture had happened? What might a remake

808
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:20,180
of Pitfall look like now? Tiger Claw says, Imagine next gen Pitfall. Well, a lot of them went 3D.

809
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:25,860
I'm not sure it's, you know, as exciting as the original was, but it sure seems like a lot of you

810
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:34,100
would go run a game like this. So, yeah. Let's see. Bobby Blackwell says, My Pitfall experience

811
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:39,220
was on Intellivision. Yeah, there was a version of this on Intellivision. I believe they released

812
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:45,700
Pitfall on the Sega Master System as well. But if I remember correctly, that is a port of the

813
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:52,980
arcade game, which is Pitfall 2. So, it is not the original, original Pitfall. So, but there it is,

814
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:58,900
your classic game of the week, Pitfall, originally on the Atari 2600, but later out on a variety of

815
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:06,980
different systems. So, I hope you like that. Yeah. I wasn't sure what to pick tonight. So, I was,

816
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:11,620
well, I had asked somebody else to do it, but our schedules couldn't line up today to do it.

817
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:15,940
So, I was like, all right, last minute pick, I'll do it. So, sorry, Loki, I really need to let you

818
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:22,260
have a turn and pick something, but that's fine. Yeah, it's fine. We'll let you drive soon. What's

819
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:26,740
a game you want to do? Do you know? Oh, gosh, I don't know. All right, well, you probably

820
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:33,220
shouldn't ruin it anyway. All right. That was the classic game of the week. So, let's get back into

821
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:38,100
some rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines happening in the gaming world this week.

822
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:45,540
Loki. Yes, the Steam Deck is getting a delay. Well, the dock is. They're not putting out the

823
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:51,940
dock for your Steam Deck. So, you're just going to have to plug it into a normal USB device for now.

824
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:57,780
But yes, they'll be coming later. They said they didn't specifically target a new window,

825
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:02,500
but that they would be rolling out at some point.

826
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,860
We're working on improving the situation and we'll share more when we have it.

827
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:15,700
But things that we do have somewhat of a window for. It's going to be Super Nintendo World coming

828
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:22,500
to Universal Studios Hollywood. That is going to be coming early 2023. This was revealed in a tweet

829
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:28,900
that they put out. So, very exciting to see that coming nearby, because Japan's too far away from

830
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:34,340
me. Yeah, I'm excited. And it's not Orlando either, because usually all the cooking

831
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:40,820
park shit goes to Orlando first. So, sorry, but it's our turn to get something before Orlando.

832
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:46,660
So, I got Harry Potter World. It's fine, you know. So, you got Harry Potter World first,

833
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:51,380
then we get this first. Yeah. So, we get the Mario World. And it sounds like the ride is a

834
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:55,220
little different than Japan. It's still Mario Kart, but it sounds like it's like Bowser's

835
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:58,500
Castle or something instead. Like, it's different than what they have in Japan.

836
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,340
Probably just the environment or whatever. No, the ride's in Bowser's Castle.

837
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:08,660
Then maybe I'm mixing the Japan one up with something. Like, I think the theming is different

838
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:12,900
slightly between the two. I think maybe the track or whatever is going to ultimately be different.

839
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:17,700
So, well, yeah. Maybe that means the Orlando one will be different as well. Who knows?

840
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:22,740
They need a roller coaster in there. Yeah. All right. Chad is telling me it's

841
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,940
the same as Japan's. I thought it was a different theming. All right. Whatever.

842
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:29,300
Maybe because you were thinking, because the interactive ride's called Mario Kart

843
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:33,940
Bowser's Challenge. But that's what I think it's called in Japan too.

844
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:41,380
Okay. All right. But yeah. Let's road trip, Loki. Let's go. Let's go to the, I guess,

845
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:47,140
the broccoli farm and go. This isn't a broccoli farm. That's Disneyland.

846
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:50,820
This would be the asparagus farm. All right. Asparagus farm. Yeah.

847
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:58,340
But that'll be fun. I definitely want to go check this out when it opens. I wonder how crowded it

848
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:04,420
will be when it first kind of opens. Probably pretty early in the year. You know, it's probably

849
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:09,540
best to get in there before summer. And the nice thing is my job is super cool. And if I want to

850
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:13,780
just take like a Wednesday, Thursday in the middle of week off to go do it, I can do it. So that's

851
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:18,260
probably what I'll do. I'll go on a Wednesday. My worry is that like literally you're going to go

852
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:23,380
there and like spend an hour and you're like, okay, I've seen everything. Like, that's kind of

853
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:29,460
how I feel it's going to be. Probably. But I like the other rides at Universal Studios Hollywood.

854
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:34,420
The first time we ever went on the Mummy ride, which is different than Orlando. It's not an

855
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:40,260
outdoor coaster like Orlando is. The Mummy ride is an indoor black light ride. But we didn't know. So

856
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:43,700
I went with extra for for those of you that remember Hoard House and, you know, remember

857
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:49,860
extra has been on this show, too. I went for the first time to Universal Hollywood with extra. We

858
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:53,780
went on the Mummy ride and we didn't know what it was. We had no idea what we knew. It was a black

859
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:58,820
light ride and we heard it was a thrill ride. So for those of you that have been on it, it's have

860
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:02,900
you been on this ride? Loki, the Mummy ride? No, I haven't been there. I'm going to spoil it for

861
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:06,740
you, but with good reason. So when the ride starts, yeah, it's like a black light, right?

862
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:10,340
You're going from like room to room and it zips around and you're like, Oh, wow, this is pretty

863
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:13,940
cool. And it kind of like moves, you know, kind of like, Whoa, whoa, like, it's like, like the

864
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:18,020
people mover, you know, on crack or whatever. It's like, Whoa. And then you get to this point at the

865
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:24,740
end. And the, the big evil Pharaoh, I don't know those movies very well, comes on or whatever and

866
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:30,260
says, like, now I have possessed you or something and does whatever. And then you go backwards,

867
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:36,100
lightning fast through the entire thing you just went through, which I think they actually cleverly

868
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:40,340
put on an actually different track to keep things moving. It's not just forward and back. I think

869
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:44,980
you actually go backwards, like a different way or whatever. But it's it feels like you're going back

870
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:51,220
through the same thing. And you're going like 70 miles an hour backwards. Xfer and I had no idea

871
01:20:51,220 --> 01:21:00,020
that this was about to happen. The pitch at which we screamed our heads off. I'm sure that like,

872
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:05,380
there were little kids on the ride that are like, Who are these two man screaming babies in the

873
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:11,620
front of this car right now? But we didn't know that like, we did not know that the ride went

874
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:19,540
backward at like 70 miles an hour. Check out one of those like 4k walkthroughs on. Yeah.

875
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:26,740
It's wild. And then you get back and then you're, you're back at start. And we're just like,

876
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:29,300
what the fuck just happened? What happened? Oh my God.

877
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,540
Like screaming.

878
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:35,540
That's funny.

879
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:40,980
All right. As Joanna Matt says, they made a mirror image of the ride to make it work. I think

880
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:44,740
defunct land did a thing on it. Yeah. I'm pretty sure you're just going back in reverse, like

881
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:50,900
mirror image, but it was really, really fun. And so now I love to ride that ride every time I go

882
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:57,300
to universal Hollywood. Cause I think it's great. And as much as the, the writer of the series

883
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:02,340
annoys me, I consider Harry Potter at this point to be a Hatsune Miku written series.

884
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:08,980
So I enjoy going to the wizarding world and drinking the butter beer and that ride is

885
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:15,540
really well done. The Hatsune Miku presents the wizarding world ride is, is great. I love that

886
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:22,900
ride. So you weren't talking to Mrs. I said, I don't like that turf who wrote the book. So as

887
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:28,260
far as I'm concerned, Hatsune Miku wrote, yeah, I buy into Hatsune Miku wrote it. So that's,

888
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:34,660
that's where I am with that. Hatsune Potter. Yes. And then I love that Simpsons ride is so

889
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:38,900
fucking cute. I want to see that. It looked awesome. That ride is fun. That used to be

890
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:42,900
the back to the future ride back in the day, but now it's really fun. So they have some,

891
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:46,100
they have some cute rides at the transformer rides. Really impressive too. Anyway,

892
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:49,300
I don't mean for this whole thing to be a fucking ad for universal studios, Hollywood,

893
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:52,260
but I would say there are more things to do there than just super Mario world.

894
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:57,460
And like you have to do the backlot tour. If you're going to go to universal use,

895
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:01,540
it takes like an hour to get through the backlot tour. Cause you're in line for 20 minutes.

896
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:07,620
The tour is like 25 minutes. It's not short. You go on this Tramra and then the tram has some

897
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:11,940
weird stuff built into it. Like there's like a King Kong tunnel, but it's super lame. They

898
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:16,580
need to get rid of it. Earthquake. And yeah, the earthquake's actually pretty cool. Although it's

899
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:23,060
very like 1970s movie, but it's cool. Well, it's 1990s cause like I remember when they first put

900
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:28,260
that in, like we went to it and did all that. Oh, that's cool. They had a fast and furious thing

901
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:32,900
last time I was there, which was okay. Yes. They had that too with the dancing cars.

902
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:38,900
No, they replaced the car scene with a whole like a tunnel. You go in and a movie plays and

903
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:43,780
all this stuff. They replaced the carpet. Yeah. Oh yeah. Cause the dancing car thing. I was like,

904
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:49,060
okay, cool. Yeah. No, there was like a car crash reenactment or something.

905
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:55,460
Oh yeah. And then they always have to do Jaws. They have Norman Bates come out and chase the car.

906
01:23:55,460 --> 01:24:00,900
Yep. And it just depends what else is going on because like they used to have the Desperate

907
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:06,420
Housewives street was there and there was because they do shoot things there. The voice shoots at

908
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:10,340
Universal Hollywood, I think. And they would always talk about that. So anyway, sorry,

909
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:13,940
I don't mean to turn this into a theme park podcast, uh, dark diseases, whatever happened

910
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:19,380
to the explicit Disney podcast. I would so still do something like that, but like theme parks are,

911
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:24,820
I'm going to be explicit fucking expensive. So that's traveling around to the theme parks is

912
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:31,540
the challenge with that, to be honest. So anyway. All right. Um, let's move on. Let's travel around

913
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:35,540
the world and check out some release dates and things that will be out faster than we can get to

914
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:41,060
Universal Studios Hollywood. Not much to speak because of course, you know, it being previously

915
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:48,820
E3 week, but not quite E3 week. Uh, there's not a lot coming out. So, uh, let's see, we've got.

916
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:53,380
They'll probably be some today releases with, um, summer game Fest.

917
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:57,300
Yeah. Some digital stuff. Um, so we have Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic two,

918
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:02,820
the Sith Lords on Nintendo switch, uh, the cycle frontier on PC.

919
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:10,580
We have even if tempest on tend to switch tour de France, 22 on PC PlayStation four,

920
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:17,460
PlayStation five, X-Box one and X-Box series, demon Slayer, uh, Komitsu, no,

921
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:26,260
yeah. Bye. Uh, the Hinokami Chronicles on Nintendo switch, Mario strikers, battle league on

922
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:33,300
Nintendo switch, uh, metal max Zeno reborn on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four.

923
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:40,420
And last but not least the query on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, X-Box

924
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:45,620
one and X-Box series going over to Japan and checking out the releases there on the

925
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:50,260
Nintendo switch this week, we have demon Slayer, Kimetsu, no, yeah. Uh, you know,

926
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:55,380
come a couple of time comes out this week. Uh, that is in Japan, regular and limited edition,

927
01:25:55,380 --> 01:26:02,420
a game called clap, exclamation exclamation with a K. So it's K L a P. And I was disappointed to

928
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:06,660
find out this game is not about clapping. Um, but it is, it looks like it's another dating

929
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:10,180
SIM to be quite, I don't know if it's based on anime or what, but apparently this is whole,

930
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:15,460
a whole like a, but it's, I think it's a female protagonist where you date men is what I believe

931
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:22,100
this one is. So, um, that's fun. Um, yeah, you do not get the clap as part of the game. I don't,

932
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:30,180
I don't know what K L a P stands for. Um, perhaps. Yeah. Anyway, um, moving on, what else do we have

933
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:35,140
in Japan this week? We have, Oh, Mario strikers battle league is a worldwide release of course.

934
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:40,340
So it is out in Japan this week as well. So, um, really that's about it for the switch

935
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:48,100
on the PlayStation five. Um, nothing. Oh no, the quarry actually is, would be this week.

936
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:51,300
So that game also gets a Japanese release this week, which is, um,

937
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:55,780
I can't imagine it's localized for Japan, but I will point out it's published by take two over

938
01:26:55,780 --> 01:27:01,220
there instead of two K that's the same thing. Yeah. Which is why, why did they put it under

939
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:06,100
different labels though? That's weird. I don't know. Yeah, that's weird. Maybe they don't know

940
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:15,700
two K over there. All right. Anyway, let's move on. How about the UK? We've got spell force three

941
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:24,740
rebound. Um, that's coming on PlayStation four and X-Box series. We have Ikai on PlayStation

942
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:32,580
four and five and to switch metal max Xena reborn on PlayStation and the switch Mario

943
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:41,460
strikers battle league on Nintendo switch demon Slayer on Nintendo switch. Also getting the quarry

944
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:50,100
on PlayStation and X-Box as well. And that's it. There's a lot of people I know that are super

945
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:55,060
excited about that quarry game because, um, spiritual successor to until dawn,

946
01:27:55,780 --> 01:28:01,060
give me a quarry rush of blood, please. Which is weird because until dawn, that whole,

947
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:04,820
what do they call that universe? There's other games that have already come out in that universe.

948
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:09,620
Um, really? Yeah. I can't God damn it. I can't remember the name. Somebody in chattel beat me

949
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:14,820
to it, but it's the whole, like, there's a whole universe where, and there's other games that have

950
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:21,140
come out in that, but they're, they have not really seemed to catch wind the way, um, until

951
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:27,300
dawn did. So this seems to be like the true, like spiritual successor to the game. There was a VR

952
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:32,340
game that they put out. What the hell was it called blood? No, no, a different one that,

953
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,740
that was more like until dawn with the choices and stuff.

954
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:44,260
Oh, um, it's going to bug me until I figure out what that game is called.

955
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:50,420
Butterfly. No, wait, no, that's not butterfly effect. Uh, that's a game mechanic.

956
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:52,820
Let's see. Don't know.

957
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:00,820
Now I need to look at like what super massive games did.

958
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:05,300
Was it house of ashes? Yes. House of ashes. I think was one of them

959
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:11,700
that they did the dark. They call it anthology. That's what I was thinking that there were other

960
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:15,460
house of ashes. It's dark pictures, anthology. That's, that's what I was trying to think of.

961
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:20,740
So there we go. Phew. That was going to bother me until I knew what it was. All right.

962
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:26,500
All right. Let's, uh, let's get into some more news, more bundles

963
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:30,260
games for great causes on the cheap, right? Loki.

964
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:40,340
Yes, we have the, um, the queer games bundle is going to be coming out on itch.io and is a

965
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:48,500
collection of 500 plus games that you can get for $60. So that's going to be benefiting. I guess

966
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:54,980
the money is going to the LG BTQ developers who may be 500 games. I don't think they're

967
01:29:54,980 --> 01:30:01,700
donating it to anything else, but it's good to support them. Um, what else?

968
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:05,140
I want to see what games are in here. If there's anything I recognize.

969
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:12,420
Uh, well, and honestly, maybe the fact that you don't recognize something is part of the

970
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:18,580
reason why a bundle can really help bring visibility, um, to the games. So I think that's

971
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:24,260
great. Yeah. I'll check it out. Let's look through. Yeah. I want to see maybe, wait,

972
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:27,700
I just saw a Lincoln chat here. So let me check it out here. Cause I actually didn't know about

973
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:34,340
this fundraiser. Um, and I'm curious if I recognize anything here. Um, I swear somebody

974
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:42,260
linked this Parmesan game on Twitter. Um, the Parmesan, an eight bit story about a non-binary

975
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:45,220
person being bullied for being who they are. I'm almost positive. Somebody I know who's

976
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:50,340
non-binary was talking about that game. Um, I'm going to tell you right now, I have my

977
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:56,500
winner of the bundle here. Crime frog. Crime frog? That sounds fun.

978
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:03,220
Opposite of frog detective. You're a frog that commits crimes. Or there's also wrapped your

979
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:11,300
boyfriend. Uh, what's, oh, I like this. Look at this. There's a game called X purrs. Oh no,

980
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:16,820
that's the, is that the name of the game? Yeah. X purrs online X. Chat with your online cat

981
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:23,060
friends. That's perfect. Perfect. Yeah. I'll pick up this bundle for sure.

982
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:27,220
Yes. There's, there's lots of interesting things in here.

983
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:31,060
Awesome. Oh no. As you went home, Matt sent the wrong link.

984
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:38,100
Oh, he sent me the 2021 bundle. Dick. No, I'm just kidding. It's fine. He was getting me all

985
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:44,100
excited about these games. All right. That's all right. Let me see if I get, let me see what I

986
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:47,220
noticed in the 2022, but all right. Well, you know what? It doesn't take away from anything

987
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:54,740
I said about those other games. Um. Crime frog. That's really what I don't.

988
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:58,980
Yeah. I don't wreck it. Actually. I do notice there are a lot of games from the 2021 bundle

989
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:04,340
that are here too. What's this sock puppet song and dance. Oh, it's songs and step charts for

990
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:10,980
step mania. That's fun. That's a cute add on. Duck. Yeah. Sock puppets, song and dance. There's

991
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:16,980
something called duck, duck swap. Are you a duck or a duck or a duck? I like that. A game called

992
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:21,540
three lesbians in a Barrow. You know exactly what you're going to get with that. I love it.

993
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:27,540
All right. I'll check this out. Sorry. I, I know me scrolling through a list does not make for the

994
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:32,660
most exciting radio, but I was like genuinely curious. What was, uh, in this Virginia

995
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:38,820
Wolfenstein, but with two O's. See, that's funny. Well, here's another one. Here we go.

996
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:45,220
Lay lay perfect crime. It is a cat based stealth game set in a museum.

997
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:52,740
And there's another cat game here called screams and Queens, but it's a tabletop RPG,

998
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:58,100
but it stars cat pageant Queens at a spooky school. I mean, I like the amount of cat games

999
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:04,500
in the cat games, but gays love cats. Like, and I'm, I'm saying that with firsthand experience,

1000
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:12,020
um, here, here's the thing. People try to get me to play D and D and I'm always like, yeah,

1001
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:15,700
D and D is cool, but like, I don't know. I'm kind of, but like, if you invite me over,

1002
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:19,940
like don't invite me over to play D and D invite me over to play cat pageant, Queens,

1003
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:23,220
tabletop RPG, and then I'll be like, Oh, yeah, I'm in. Tell me more

1004
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:31,380
people, people. All right. Uh, thanks for the heads up about the bundle though. Sounds great.

1005
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:37,380
Uh, what else do we have? Okay. All right. And then, uh, we also have

1006
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:46,420
a, uh, there's a, tell me why is free to download now on Xbox and PC and celebration of

1007
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:53,460
pride month. So you can get that via the Microsoft store or steam. So that's pretty cool.

1008
01:33:54,820 --> 01:34:01,380
Also Xbox publishing is going to be donating $25,000 to each of the transgender law center

1009
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:06,500
and trends lifeline. Awesome. And that's good. That's a good, I haven't played through the

1010
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:10,500
entire series, but, um, I really liked the first episode and I just need to finish it,

1011
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:14,260
but you know, my attention span won't let me do those types of things. So yeah, check it out.

1012
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:24,260
Yeah. And then, uh, we've got news that, uh, Junichi Masuda is leaving the Pokemon company.

1013
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:29,460
Um, or I'm sorry, leaving game freak for a role at the Pokemon company.

1014
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:34,980
So he says, I've served as the director of the Pokemon video game series, starting with

1015
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:41,300
Pokemon Ruby version, Pokemon Sapphire version up until Pokemon X and Y, um, and was involved

1016
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:45,940
in the development of many video games, including Pokemon go. I would like to express my heartfelt

1017
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:51,140
thanks to all the Pokemon fans going forward. I hope to transcend the batteries of video games

1018
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:57,220
by trying to offer greater surprises, fun, and excitement to people all over the world while

1019
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:02,740
doing my utmost to connect people, expand the circle of play and help bring about a richer

1020
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:09,300
world for us to share. I appreciate your continued support in my new role. And, uh, what is that new

1021
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:16,500
role? He's going to be, let's see. I don't know. It's going to be doing something.

1022
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:21,220
Well, if he's moving to the general Pokemon company as opposed to just game freak,

1023
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:26,100
you imagine that he's on these Pokemon projects that aren't just the video games because, you

1024
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:31,620
know, keep in mind, Pokemon is a fucking brand, right? It's the anime, it's the stuffed toys,

1025
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:37,620
it's the movies, it's, it's everything. Right. And to hear him talk about new experiences is that

1026
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:42,020
maybe it is something beyond just a game as we think about, I don't know, my brain kind of goes

1027
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:47,060
to AR type of experiences. Cause I feel AR because it's like, you hear Niantic talking a lot about

1028
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:51,060
that too. Not that I'm saying that necessarily like, you know, who will Pokemon go already?

1029
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:57,140
He's going to be the chief creative fellow. So, okay. So he's responsible for coming up

1030
01:35:57,140 --> 01:36:00,900
with new ideas for where Pokemon is going next. And I think that's very evident in what he's

1031
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:05,860
saying in his statement too, is that he wants to go beyond just a video game. He wants to do with

1032
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:10,020
the Katamari Damacy guy did and make a playground. That's what he wants to make a Pikachu.

1033
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:13,540
Yeah, but he came back to games. There's only so many playgrounds you can do before you get

1034
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:17,860
bored of that. That's like, that's a hobby thing. And then you go back to what you know.

1035
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:22,260
Yeah. But I think that, I think that's what it is. This is about kind of like doing things other

1036
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:27,860
than just the game, but like realizing a fun thing in other ways. And it's probably just playing with

1037
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:34,980
new technology to see where that might be. Or he's, or they're reviving Pokemon sleep

1038
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:40,180
and maybe he's, he's going on that. Who knows? It's worth a shot.

1039
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:46,580
He's going on sleep. I'm taking a sleep from now until, eh, in the future.

1040
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:48,500
No, Pokemon sleep. Remember?

1041
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:52,340
Yeah, exactly. I understand that. But in order to test Pokemon sleep, you have to sleep.

1042
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:54,420
Ah, you have to nap a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1043
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:54,920
Yeah.

1044
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:59,380
SSG100Matt says, Pokemon theme park in North America, please.

1045
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:04,660
Honestly, honestly, would any of us be sad if that's what he's doing?

1046
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:08,980
No, I don't think any of us would be sad. A Pokemon theme park? Sign me the fuck up.

1047
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:11,780
Don't they already have those in Japan?

1048
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:17,220
Well, I think so. They have like Pokemon centers for sure too. That's just basically the store.

1049
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:22,660
They've got to have a whole theme park. I'm surprised the Nintendo partnership with

1050
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:26,420
Universal doesn't turn into that. But I think that they're expanding on that.

1051
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:29,220
So like Nintendo Land, what they have right now is just kind of...

1052
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:33,220
To correct myself, technically, Nintendo doesn't own Pokemon. The Pokemon company

1053
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:35,140
owns Pokemon, right? So it gets into those nuances.

1054
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:35,700
I get that.

1055
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:36,340
Right. Yeah, yeah.

1056
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:39,380
But like, I think, though, that they were supposed to be expanding to

1057
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:42,100
like a Donkey Kong country thing.

1058
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:42,740
Yeah.

1059
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:47,060
Yeah. Well, yeah. So I don't know. We'll see.

1060
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:53,940
I would love a Pokemon theme park. I would even travel to like North Dakota for a Pokemon theme

1061
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:58,180
park or like a state that's like not really on my must go. Montana? Let's fucking go.

1062
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:02,500
Like, I'll go to a place that's not usually at the top of my travel list.

1063
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,580
They can have Pokemon Snap IRL.

1064
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:08,500
Now you're fucking talking. Absolutely.

1065
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:10,900
That's the game you need. Yeah.

1066
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:17,060
All right. Before we get to the listener roundtable, let's talk about Super Bomberman

1067
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:24,100
R and how they are ending the online service. Specifically, it's Super Bomberman R Online,

1068
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:31,700
which I believe is a separate release than the Super Bomberman R that originally came out

1069
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:37,620
for Nintendo Switch. They did a Super Bomberman R Online in May of 2021.

1070
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:41,460
So it hasn't even been a year and the plug's getting pulled.

1071
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:44,100
I'm sorry. It has been one year. Excuse me. One year.

1072
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:50,100
So Dr. Seuss says, yeah, it's the free to play one.

1073
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:54,820
Why is Konami closing this? This is Konami.

1074
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:59,620
But on the record, they've said the series is moving forward with new projects

1075
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:05,860
and they want to show off something soon and says, thanks for the support of the series.

1076
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:10,660
However, go to hell. We're pulling the plug. No, they didn't say that second part,

1077
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:13,780
but that's what it feels like to fans of Super Bomberman R Online.

1078
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:16,580
But here's my question. How many people were actually still playing that game?

1079
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:21,700
And I'm not talking about the original Super Bomberman R.

1080
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:24,260
How many people were actually playing that online game?

1081
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:28,660
Which wasn't that a Stadia thing too? I swear that was a thing they announced

1082
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:31,140
for Stadia right around that time too. It may have been.

1083
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:36,740
I'm Googling it right now. Yes, it is. It was a Stadia thing.

1084
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:41,220
Cause I think Stadia was really hyping that up when it originally came out on that as well. So

1085
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:49,220
RIP and peace. That's it for the news that we have scheduled tonight.

1086
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:53,380
Now we'd like to invite you guys to participate with the show. If you'd like to call us

1087
01:39:54,340 --> 01:40:00,180
in our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord, that's vognetwork.com slash discord.

1088
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:04,020
And in the green room is the place you can go to get in on the show.

1089
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:08,420
You can send us an email if you like. Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1090
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:12,180
I don't think we have any emails tonight. Sad face, but maybe next week we will get some.

1091
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:18,020
Thank you. Orange Rite is saying what I thought was the case. It started as a Stadia exclusive

1092
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:20,340
and it went to other consoles eventually.

1093
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:23,380
The Stadia still has a Pac-Man game that's exclusive, don't they?

1094
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:27,860
But I thought Bomberman wasn't that on, it wasn't the exclusive though, wasn't it

1095
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:30,420
also on the Switch? I thought that was a Switch launch title.

1096
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:35,780
It was eventually, but no, you're, you're, there was a Super Bomberman R on the Switch.

1097
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:42,820
There was that. This is a online free to play thing. That's basically the same fucking thing.

1098
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:47,220
It's, it's Bomberman, Loki. You know how much that game's evolved over the years?

1099
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:54,500
Not that much. So that Bomberman online specific one was Stadia first. And then

1100
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:58,980
when Stadia kind of didn't have enough players, uh, they released it to other places too.

1101
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:04,260
All right. We do have somebody waiting in the green room. It's a, it's a frequent call.

1102
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:07,220
It's a serial caller to OLR, but we love to hear from this caller.

1103
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:08,740
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1104
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:14,180
And they, they popped right back to the green room. Awesome. Let's try again.

1105
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:16,900
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1106
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:21,940
Hello there, good friend. Hi, how are you?

1107
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:25,300
No, I'm fine. How about you?

1108
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:28,180
Good. It's the one and only Rama everybody. How are you?

1109
01:41:29,060 --> 01:41:30,260
Good. I'm good.

1110
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:32,180
What's on your mind tonight?

1111
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:38,580
Oh, oh, Robinson Roberts. You and I need to have a little talk young man.

1112
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:39,540
Don't you call me by my full name.

1113
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:42,580
I just did. And there's a reason why I did.

1114
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:46,980
Oh, why is that? What did I do? Oh, is this last week? Oh, I can't wait.

1115
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,220
Yeah. I was gone for the whole weekend. You know,

1116
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:53,060
Memorial day off having a good time.

1117
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:55,540
Anime convention. How dare you?

1118
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:57,060
No, no, no.

1119
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:59,300
I thought it was, I thought there was a big anime con last week.

1120
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:03,300
There's like, there was like three to four major anime conventions.

1121
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:10,500
I, I spent it with a friend, but I have to come back into discord, you know, after

1122
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:17,220
work and all of that. And I was told to listen to last week's show and a DDR challenge.

1123
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,020
That's right. That's right.

1124
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:25,940
Why? Why are called into the show last week and basically was like, Hey, Rama, you got served.

1125
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:30,100
And is it now, is it on it's on?

1126
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:32,340
No.

1127
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:36,020
Okay. What's tell me, tell me how you reacted to hearing that whole thing last week.

1128
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:43,060
It's just a muse because I was talking about throwing together DDR for us, older folk,

1129
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:47,220
like some of the more of the classic songs from DDR. That's no longer there.

1130
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:51,940
That today's generation had no idea. I've heard of like, have you ever been mellow?

1131
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:56,260
You know, some of the great suffered through keep on moving. I don't think you have,

1132
01:42:56,260 --> 01:43:00,500
or, and I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry. That song is fine.

1133
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:05,140
Wow. I'm definitely getting old. I'm sorry. Let them move was the song I meant to say.

1134
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:06,500
Have you ever suffered through?

1135
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:11,540
Have you ever suffered to let them move? I don't think you have.

1136
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:18,580
Yeah, I, I I've suffered. I know you have. I'm just saying these, these young kids today,

1137
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:26,340
they don't know, but the main reason why I am not accepting why our challenge is because

1138
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:34,260
years ago I couldn't even pass max 300 on basic. What makes them think that I could do it now?

1139
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:40,660
Because you're good enough. You're strong enough and doggone it. People like you.

1140
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:49,540
Just true. But scientific fact knows that my endurance can't make me do it because if I do it,

1141
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:56,820
you're going to need to have nine one one on speed dial and oxygen tank and a cart nearby. Okay.

1142
01:43:56,820 --> 01:44:01,540
Cause you, I am going to either collapse halfway through the step chart or you're going to drag me

1143
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:06,740
off. Here's the thing. And I'm going to say this to YYRS credit actually, although yes,

1144
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:13,300
this is a very lofty challenge. There's a lofty goal to me. I really put this on the same level

1145
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:21,700
as I'm going to train to run a marathon, not walk a marathon, run a marathon that is in my, like,

1146
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:27,380
that is kind of literally what the ask is here on the physical level. I mean, you know,

1147
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:31,220
some would argue the ins and outs of it, but I would say it's, it's very similar to

1148
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:35,380
basically saying, Hey, Rama, I want you to train to run a marathon, which is,

1149
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:39,540
it's a very lofty goal, but that it's going to take some work. It takes a bit of training.

1150
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:43,620
You do have to build up your stamina and so forth. I do. I do applaud what, of course I

1151
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:48,820
love what we are. I love they calls it a show and so forth. And I do applaud his effort behind that,

1152
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:53,300
you know, and trying to get people to us old assholes to get more physically active.

1153
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:58,580
And yes, he's a good example of you don't, you can be 40 and still do this shit. And I think

1154
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:04,820
probably he's sick of hearing you and me say, no, we can't. No, we can't. He's sitting here going,

1155
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:08,660
yes, you fucking can shut up, baby. I'm, I'm putting words in his mouth, but essentially

1156
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:13,860
that's what he's saying. So I, on that level, I completely respect that. Like, you know,

1157
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:19,220
you got to work for it and get, but it's just, you know, do we have the time to do that now?

1158
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:26,900
Now, Rama, I think for me and where I'm at, I'm a little more apt to try this challenge because

1159
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:32,980
I've already, thanks to things that happened to me personally, six months ago, have been making

1160
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:37,540
diet changes and weight changes. And, you know, I've talked about how I've lost 50 pounds over

1161
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:41,780
the last nine months, which is a huge life accomplishment, right? But that means that

1162
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:46,420
my body's already, and I can see it in the heart meter. When I walk, it used to be that my heart

1163
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:51,540
rate was really high. Now, my heart rate when I'm like walking is like not going up very much

1164
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:56,420
at all, which is actually showing me, I probably need to get more physical activity. My only problem

1165
01:45:56,420 --> 01:46:01,140
is I don't really have a DDR machine near me anymore. I mean, I'm hoping that the Roseville

1166
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:04,260
round one opens, but even then you're talking about a machine that's gonna be like 30 minutes

1167
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:10,100
away from me. It's on the other, other side of Sacramento, literally. Well, I totally hear you

1168
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:16,420
on that. Now where I work, which is like 10 blocks from Times Square, there's a Dave and

1169
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:22,020
Busters right there. I can go there. Now the new one in Brooklyn, also that one is on my way home.

1170
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:29,380
I actually said to a friend of mine, when we went to go play, we should do this every Friday night,

1171
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:36,020
you know, because personally, when I went with that Dave and Busters with all five of my power

1172
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:42,420
cards and had them put together, I think I have total of over a hundred tickets and 180 chips

1173
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:47,540
all together. So I'm like, all they're doing is collecting dust. So I will sit and I will do this.

1174
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:54,900
I will do three runs and then go home. Add me some water, have me some tea. And if I did some

1175
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:58,340
really good, I'll go to the bar, have me a rum and Coke and be like, dammit, I deserve this.

1176
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:04,420
Now I hear you about the Dave and Busters, about the round one being a half hour away.

1177
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:08,260
It would be one thing if you were driving back and forth and it's long the way.

1178
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:12,340
And I just, I could also go to Loki's house to use a DDR machine.

1179
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:16,020
Loki's even further away.

1180
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:22,580
You know, Rob, you know, step mania, right?

1181
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:23,080
Yeah.

1182
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:25,940
Do you have DDR pads in your house?

1183
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:26,500
Not anymore.

1184
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:29,540
Do you see where I'm going with this?

1185
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:32,660
Yeah, I could. I could. Yeah. Maybe.

1186
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:41,220
Why not? Yeah. I'm just saying between me and your darling husband, we probably have enough

1187
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:46,500
PC parts to build together a simple machine with all the step charts. And you probably know

1188
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:50,260
somebody that you could borrow a hard pad from, plug it in and roll with it.

1189
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:56,180
Hubby and I have birthdays coming up and we're looking at, get this, this is how gay we are,

1190
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:01,140
matching PCs. We're going to get matching PCs. We're just, because we're at that,

1191
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:05,140
we're also at that age drama where we're just like, just pay the other people to build the

1192
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:12,660
PCs and send them to us in a box. No, that's far from a gay thing to do.

1193
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:18,500
That's a gaming thing to do. I actually know couples who had their gaming machines right

1194
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:24,420
next to each other. I'm the type of person where no move your rig further away. I need all this

1195
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:30,340
space, but you know, I think that's wonderful. So ironically, this machine here could be a step

1196
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:34,820
mania machine if I really want it to be. If you're getting, I'm just saying,

1197
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:41,060
if you're getting a brand new PCs across the board, you can move OLR studio on software to

1198
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:47,380
the new PC retrofit, the old machine with the DDR pad, dark tip. So you probably has all of

1199
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:52,180
the step charts. He's probably chilling in your backyard, you know, in the trench coat, opening

1200
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:57,620
it up. Like I got all the mixes right here. What you need. I just also realized I literally have

1201
01:48:57,620 --> 01:49:03,540
a Mac mini that now does nothing. If we want to take all our mobile again at some point,

1202
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:08,100
I guess it's there. But yeah, now I have, I have a Mac mini paperweight at this point. So there's

1203
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:17,940
also that. Yeah, you know that too. Well, right there, you know, I say, why not? It's worth

1204
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:22,900
thinking about because then I think about, Oh, but this room is upstairs. It might make a lot

1205
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:27,060
of noise, but then I'm like, Oh, wait a minute. The downstairs neighbor is me. Cause we live,

1206
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:30,980
we live in a townhouse where we have like our living areas downstairs and upstairs is the

1207
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:38,900
bedrooms. So yeah, better. And I mean like, you might as well just take it a step further,

1208
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:43,540
not just put step many on there. See if you can emulate a guitar freaks and beat mania and throw

1209
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:48,500
it on there. Why not? You know, you got me thinking, I'm going to say that you've got me

1210
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:58,740
thinking. All I did was have a, I just got a micro ITX board and a Ryzen, I think it was a

1211
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:07,380
Ryzen three with an APU. Um, and then just like maybe four gigs of Ram. It's like, you don't

1212
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:15,460
really need anything. And then just an SSD, you know, uh, I, so it's like, it's literally, it's

1213
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:22,820
all in just like a tiny board and that's it. Hmm. Yeah. One drive the boot, the OS and other drive

1214
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:28,500
with all this, with all the mixes and the step. All right. You got me, you got me. We'll see.

1215
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:35,700
I mean, Rob, if you play this right, the only money you'll be spending is getting, um, hard

1216
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:40,740
pads. That's it. Yeah, no, that's right. Cause it's something I could hook up on USB or something.

1217
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:45,700
Yeah, for sure. All right. Y'all let me think. I will neither confirm nor deny,

1218
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:50,020
but I'm thinking. You just have to drop a few thousand dollars to get an SMX machine

1219
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:55,380
and then you're all good. I will say every time, you know, cause I'm friends with Kyle

1220
01:50:55,380 --> 01:51:00,100
on Facebook cause I think probably a lot of long time music game people are every time

1221
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:07,460
he posts a song list update, I'm like, Jesus, this game. And that's a good, that's a good Jesus,

1222
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:12,100
this game this week, man, it's, it's all been electric, electric call boy, man.

1223
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:17,860
Like that. And he fucking got desire, uh, which is now he's, you know, one of his,

1224
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:22,100
a new desire song, like, so like Sugaru from the old school DDR days,

1225
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:25,780
like there's a new one of those in the game now. And I'm like, Jesus, this game.

1226
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:31,460
So Bobby does say, make sure it's on the bottom floor of your house. So you don't shake the

1227
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:36,020
ceiling and they're in is kind of the problem. Cause the bottom is already kind of spoken for us.

1228
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:41,380
I don't know. Cause the bottom is also the kitchen though, but we'll see. Never say never. I'm just,

1229
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:46,980
I'm not sure yet. Okay. And when you do go through all of this, make sure you get yourself a nice

1230
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:52,900
pair of Skechers. Well, that's not a problem. I already buy it's like everything I wear is

1231
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:59,140
Skechers are all though. So that part's easy. There you go. All right. Um, so challenge

1232
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:07,620
officially declined, but possibly me accepting some form of the challenge. We'll see DDR club

1233
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:13,620
where we play every weekend and trade off what we've been doing. Sure. You know? Yeah. I wish

1234
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:16,900
there was a step mania machine near here. Cause then we could do the whole app thing. And then,

1235
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:22,100
cause they got a, it's just, it's built smarter. I think than the only one I know of is in Rocklin

1236
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:27,380
and that's at the strike. They have went the bowling alley there. Yeah. The strike. Oh,

1237
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:32,020
well that's like 45 minutes from me, but at least it's like, I haven't played it a long time,

1238
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:37,460
but they had it there last time I was there, which was free COVID. So I need to go out there

1239
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:42,500
some weekday when the kids aren't there. It was pretty dead when we went out there,

1240
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:47,700
but even on the weekend. All right. Interesting. DT just came up with something,

1241
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:52,820
a weekly set list or something. That's not full of heavy charts. You know, he may want to join in.

1242
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:59,860
All right. We'll see our club DDR club. All right. It's it's a cute idea. I'm I'm into it.

1243
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:04,340
We'll see. We'll see when I get there. When I get the rig, we'll sell, see who's on board for a

1244
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:12,980
DDR club. Yeah. All right. Anything else on your mind tonight? Rama? That's it. But check your

1245
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:18,980
phone in the next five minutes. I'm sending you something. Okay. I will. All right. Thanks in

1246
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:24,340
advance. Whatever it is. All right. I think, unless you're going to like, okay, good. I'm

1247
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:27,540
like, it's something I'm gonna like. Right. Okay. Okay. All right. Oh, always. It's good to hear

1248
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:33,300
from you. Rama, uh, anime jam session on Tuesday. Go hear about the 500 anime conventions that

1249
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:38,500
happen nationwide this weekend. Most definitely. Oh yeah. And, uh, dragon slay conventional. Yeah,

1250
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:41,940
but it's an action. It's a fighting game. It's actually pretty good. I have it. Oh,

1251
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:46,100
okay. Good to know. All right. Take care of my friend. All right. Take care of y'all. Bye.

1252
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:50,900
All right. Always good to hear from Rama. Uh, we can probably squeeze in another call

1253
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:55,300
if anyone wants to call in, or if you have anything you would like to ask us about in chat

1254
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:59,620
over at twitch.tv slash vogue network, you might want to get that out there before I decide I'm

1255
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:06,100
done waiting. Um, Loki, any last minute stories you want to get into? Um, no, just, uh, well,

1256
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:11,860
Fortnite ended its second season. So now they're on season three. Oh, was that the big event or

1257
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:18,180
chapter three? Yeah. And now they have like their chapter three is vibing, which I don't understand

1258
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:24,260
what the gameplay is there, but they have like Indiana Jones and there's lots of dancing and

1259
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:29,780
these like ball things that you can write in just in the name and you can ride wolves. Honestly,

1260
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:34,500
I think it's that they're trying to get people to go to Fortnite just to vibe and not necessarily

1261
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:39,300
even play a game. That's it's, it's trying to expand on the social elements. Like, and I,

1262
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:44,100
I literally know nothing besides what you just said. I'm almost like, just based on,

1263
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:48,740
we've heard that like Fortnite is trying to expand into more of like a pop culture type of thing,

1264
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:52,900
uh, thinking about the Ariana Grande concert and the multiple concerts that have been in there.

1265
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:57,060
This, it probably is just to get people in there to not actually play a game and just vibe.

1266
01:54:58,420 --> 01:55:01,540
Don't play our game. They should have called it cool vibes only

1267
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:06,420
or chill vibes only. I don't know. Chill vibes only.

1268
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:14,420
Is that it? That's it. That's it. All right. Well, that's it for calls. That's it from

1269
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:18,660
chat. So that's it for the show. Oh wait. I have to see what this is that I got texted.

1270
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:23,700
Oh, this is cute.

1271
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:30,900
Interesting. Okay. Wouldn't you like to know? All right.

1272
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:34,900
I'll say it's a book. He sent me a picture of a book. I was like,

1273
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:40,740
I didn't even know that was a book. All right. Um, let's see. I do want to read the Fred Reggie

1274
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:45,220
fees and may book though. I cause that, that would have come out by now. Right. Cause I know

1275
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:48,500
he's been out promoting it. I think so. He's been promoting it. Yeah. Check it out. Yeah.

1276
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:52,980
All right. Um, that is going to do it for another episode of orange. I'll show you.

1277
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:55,460
Thank you so much for downloading our show and checking us out. Uh,

1280
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:08,100
every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here, uh, to diversify the opinions that we're

1281
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:12,420
putting out on air. A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is,

1282
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:18,180
you picked up the show is a great place to do that. Um, that's it. We go around and get the

1283
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:24,100
final thoughts now and wrap it all up. Uh, I can't believe it's 20 years this month that we've been

1284
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:29,140
doing OLR. Wowee. Wow. Well, we hope to see you back here on the 26th when we officially

1285
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:33,060
acknowledge 20 years on the air, dark soccer should be back next week. We'll hear about her

1286
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:39,140
adventures across country. Uh, let's get to our last, last final thoughts. Loki, your final

1287
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:46,900
thoughts tonight. So my final thought is that I've got, um, so my next S and P that I'm starting

1288
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:52,500
in here pretty soon. So it's on a, with a new group of people. Um, I'm doing a very awesome

1289
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:59,460
theme. The already kind of a bit of a spoiler for myself. Um, it's going to be mega man themed.

1290
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:02,980
So building stuff in Minecraft and mega man, but here's the best part though.

1291
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:12,580
I'm creating eight brand new robot masters, all based on Minecraft stuff. And each one of them

1292
01:57:12,580 --> 01:57:18,500
has their own unique soundtrack for this stage. And I have five of the songs already. They're so

1293
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:26,020
awesome. They're so awesome. Some of the best chiptune music ever. So stay tuned for that.

1294
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:34,020
All right. Um, let's see. My final thought is, um, I don't know. I gotta, I gotta play more. I

1295
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:39,220
gotta catch up with my backlog. I gotta, I kinda want to rearrange this room as well. I want to

1296
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:45,460
do that and, uh, maybe move a TV up here for some of my consoles. I don't know. I'm thinking the

1297
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:50,020
gears are turning. It's a dangerous thing. All right. Uh, that's going to do it for another

1298
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:54,020
episode of orange laundry. Have a wonderful night, everybody. We'll see you next week.

1299
