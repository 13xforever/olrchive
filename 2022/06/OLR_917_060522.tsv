0	14200	It's June! That means that the preparation for the big descent upon Los Angeles isâ€¦
14200	19120	deferred for another year, at least. Even without the annual pilgrimage of media, studios,
19120	22440	hopefuls and personalities, there is still plenty of news coming down the pipe. Less
22440	26060	of it now before the avalanche that is the keynotes by console manufacturers and other
26060	27680	large parties next week.
27680	30720	This is the first of two annual thematic intros. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob
30720	34160	Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about the gaming news, starting right now
34160	36840	on the show where every gamer has a voice.
36840	45440	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
45440	52600	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode
52600	60840	number 917 of our show for tonight, June 5th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and not
60840	65880	joining us tonight, sadly, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She is off tonight as she was helping
65880	71520	a friend move all the way to Illinois. What a good friend to move across halfway across
71520	75160	the country. But I believe she's traveling back tonight, but I just don't think she gets
75160	80760	back by showtime. So we do have here joining us tonight, as always, say hello to Techmaster
80760	81760	Loki.
81760	82760	Hello.
82760	83760	Hi, Loki. How are you?
83760	84760	I'm doing fine.
84760	90120	Ah, great. So, okay. I have to ask about this. So of course we do tape live Sunday nights
90120	95560	at VOG Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network. That's Voice of Geeks Network. 9 p.m. Eastern,
95560	102100	6 p.m. Pacific. Say that three times fast. Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Now
102100	106120	Bobby is good enough to have us on his show every week, right at the end of the show to
106120	109840	do like a little, you know, toss across call like they do on some news shows basically
109840	114360	like stay tuned. This is what's coming up. And the subject of like naming kids after
114360	120160	video game or movie characters came up and Bobby and I kind of both landed on the same
120160	125720	page of, well, we're not having kids, so this is really a non-issue. Our pets maybe, but
125720	132420	so far not really. But Loki, you are a parent and you have children who are not named after
132420	134380	video game characters.
134380	145180	Well, one sorta, but not really. It's the grandparents name, but it shares, you know.
145180	151540	Got it. But you had mentioned that you were considering at one point giving them the middle
151540	155620	name Vader. Then it was like, wait a minute, I never heard this.
155620	161060	Just my oldest son. Because we were kind of figuring out, well, what should the middle
161060	169900	name be? Because we have like, you know, they have to be named after someone who is dead.
169900	174960	So like, like for their first name has to start with like a letter of someone that's
174960	182020	dead in the family. And then the middle name is just kind of whatever. So I think Nellie
182020	185620	was the one that suggested that first.
185620	190560	That sounds like people may think it was your idea, but I'm like, Oh no, it was the wife.
190560	193280	It was, it was, it was Mrs. Loki for sure.
193280	199440	Yeah. And then somehow we, we, we settled on something not bad, but like, I don't know
199440	203560	that it was something that was definitely being tossed around for, you know, a little
203560	204560	bit.
204560	209760	I think it was, I think the whole like names that almost were stories are very interesting
209760	213760	for some reason. I mentioned this on Bobby's show, but I was very like, my name was changed
213760	218640	at the last second, the day of my name was originally supposed to be Brad.
218640	222240	So, but they changed it, which is funny if you know, you know, consider my involvement
222240	226480	in the Rocky or a picture show and the parts I played a years later, but it's just, you
226480	229920	know, it's one of those things where Nope, they, they changed it. So I could be named
229920	234120	after both my grandparents instead of just one. So it's a, it's interesting though.
234120	240400	Yeah. And then of course, you know, my youngest son, he has, you know, and I think I've mentioned
240400	245560	this when, when he was born, like, so his middle name is Layton, which is kind of like
245560	253000	professor Lee, but not, it's not really meant for that. Okay. Yeah. Fair enough. All right.
253000	256640	So what is it? What is, so of course, since we do tape live on Twitch, sometimes you can
256640	261320	either see a webcam background or you can see a video game green screen background and
261320	265400	Loki's case. And I'm not sure I recognize the game playing behind you tonight. It looks
265400	269400	like an Indiana Jones sort of thing, but what is, what is that playing behind you tonight?
269400	275280	Indiana Jones. What is it? That's that's hopper. Oh, it's the stranger things game.
275280	280520	Yeah. Oh, see, I didn't really play it to be honest. So, well, I play stranger things
280520	286200	instead of daylight, but yeah, that's a, okay. Okay. Ah, it's hopper. How could I, how could
286200	290160	I miss that? Okay. I got it. Is this because you recently watched season four, which I
290160	291960	still haven't watched.
291960	297600	Season four, part one. Yes. They're holding on to two episodes. Well, was it part two?
297600	303120	I hear is like two episodes, but it's apparently like two movie length episodes. So it's still,
303120	308040	it's still pretty, I mean, some of the episodes are pretty long in the first half. I mean,
308040	313560	there's one that was like almost an hour and a half. So I don't know. Well, it's good.
313560	317880	I'll, uh, I'll get around to seeing it at some point, but I just, I canceled Netflix.
317880	323600	So it's like, oh, now I got to either borrow a login or, you know, other ways. But, um,
323600	328840	yeah, uh, it's just bad timing, I guess on that, but I haven't been in a huge, you know,
328840	333040	with all the other stuff that's been going on lately, I just haven't really sat down
333040	338000	to watch, watch a lot of TV shows, except drag race, all stars, all winners.
338000	344200	That's the only show I've really made time for. So, all right. Um, let's get into some
344200	349640	of the week, a week's news in video games of which there was plenty, because even though
349640	355240	there's no E3 this year, we still have some interesting things that are timed around E3,
355240	360820	such as Sony's state of play, which we'll start talking about tonight. Um, although
360820	363360	I don't know about you, Loki, like, I know you want to get into some of the weeds of
363360	367440	what they announced. We can talk about that. But I, I mean, yes, there were some big announcements.
367440	370680	I'm not saying it was bad by any means. I thought, especially for like, compared to
370680	373920	most data plays, it was, it was pretty meaty. Like they had some really big announcements
373920	378320	there. It was good. I just didn't think it was a replacement for an E3 show, uh, that
378320	383320	they usually do now, but it was, well, I don't know if that, yeah, it, I don't think
383320	388040	so. I mean, but when you think about it, like a lot of it is like third party stuff that,
388040	392240	you know, and even the stuff that they talked about third party, like you could still see
392240	398320	some of that maybe being in like Jeff Keeley's thing because yeah, there wasn't a whole lot
398320	401560	of first party stuff that they announced. I mean, they did have some things, but it
401560	406080	wasn't like first party heavy, I guess. Yeah. Maybe they want to reveal some of those street
406080	412360	fighter six characters, summer game fat. Oh wait. Uh, well we'll get to that, but officially
412360	416720	revealed officially. Yeah. All right. Well tell us a little bit, why don't you run down
416720	421560	some of the headlines? We'll talk a little bit about it. Um, I couldn't watch it live
421560	426180	as work has just been very, very busy for me. So like if a press conference or whatever
426180	431320	it is, a state of play is happening during working hours on the West coast, uh, I can,
431320	434240	and that, that sucks. I'm not going to be able to watch or live stream summer game Fest
434240	438800	this year, which I was really looking forward to doing, but it's like 11 AM on a day. I'm
438800	445040	literally in class all day. But anyway, so I did watch after the fact, so I could fast
445040	448500	forward through the trailers. I didn't care about, which was great. Um, but there really
448500	452300	wasn't, there actually was very little I fast forwarded through. So it was very interesting,
452300	457720	but anyway. Yeah. So, uh, they led off with resident evil for the remake for that. And
457720	464140	that looks pretty, pretty nice. I'm supposed to be coming out March 24th of next year.
464140	468720	And along with that, of course, and this led into a lot of the PlayStation VR two stuff
468720	473960	that they're showing off. So there is going to be some sort of content for resident evil
473960	480000	for remake that is PlayStation VR two stuff. Um, along with that, they showed that they're
480000	487720	going to be bringing a resident evil seven or was it eight, eight, the village, whatever
487720	495800	that one was. Um, that was eight and they're going to be bringing that to VR as well. And
495800	500560	they let, they'd let off with the, the most appropriate footage I could think that they
500560	507940	would have for VR presentation. Um, they know their target audience. Uh, that's for sure.
507940	512820	So that is coming at some point. I'm not sure when on that. And don't forget seven
512820	517600	was the one they called biohazard. And then it was flipped in Japan where seven was resident
517600	521500	evil or biohazard seven resident evil. So seven was that one. But, um, yeah, eight is
521500	527420	a village and just the whole idea of lady Debitrescu and VR, which was all that, like,
527420	532620	it's funny because spoiler alert, but not really spoiler alert. Like she's only in the
532620	536900	first part of the game. Like she's only like, that's divided up into different segments.
536900	543140	She's only really in the first segment. I'll let you guess why. Um, but, uh, it's, it's,
543140	545780	it's one of those things where it's like, they really build the marketing around her
545780	549860	because she's such a strong character. If they do a resident evil nine, like she has
549860	556600	to be back somehow. Like she's, she's like Wesker nemesis level, like antagonist now,
556600	559860	like they have to, I wouldn't be surprised if they fucking build resident evil nine around
559860	560860	her.
560860	568060	Um, so yeah, I mean it looked, it looked all right. Um, so other PlayStation VR two stuff,
568060	578060	they showed off the, um, new, I guess it's, it's, I don't know if it's a, I guess it's
578060	581980	its own unique game. I'm not really sure if it's like a side story character that's in
581980	590060	the regular game or not. Um, but they have a new horizon, a VR game, which looks amazing.
590060	591980	So that's really going to be showing off.
591980	596860	That was a very meaty announcement for the PS VR two. I mean, well, they'd announced
596860	600540	it before, but you know, like now that we really get to see it, like it looked like
600540	606380	I was like, okay, damn, this could, this could be like a system selling sort of, you know,
606380	611500	I think half life Alex for the PlayStation type of game kind of. Yeah. I mean, it looked
611500	617140	very, very polished and it looks just like this is going to be the one that shows off,
617460	622020	you know, the features of PlayStation VR two. I, I do want to take a minute. Sorry. I don't
622020	625860	mean to bounce back too much, but because we do tape live, we get chat comments. So I want to
625860	630820	read over here from chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, tiger class says, so we're getting
630820	635460	a remake of resident evil for a couple of years from now, we'll get more remakes of the newer
635460	641940	games. Well, keep in mind, it may only feel like a couple of years. Resident evil four was
641940	646180	originally out like around the time this show started. That was, we're at, we're 20 years this
646180	650820	month, buddy. So even though it feels like resident evil four was just a few years ago,
651380	657300	that was 20 years ago, my friend. Also some of that may feel more recent because they did port
657300	661300	that stuff. They have ported it again and again. That's very true. It's like a lot of the final
661300	668420	fantasy games. So, yeah. So I mean, when we talk about what could technology look like for a
668420	674020	resident evil seven or eight remake 20 years from now, you know, it's going to probably be very
674020	679540	heavy AR VR, like it's, it's going to be like, it's, it's just not, I don't think we can even
680180	687620	envision in our minds what it will look like, because when we were all playing super Nintendo,
688260	692340	I don't think we could, which granted is more like 30 years back, but I don't think we could
692340	698340	visualize at that time. What gaming would look like now, just that it was more real,
698340	702020	but what does that mean? Right? So it's just, yeah. Anyway, sorry.
703300	707540	Of course, no man's sky had a trailer because they're bringing it to PlayStation VR too,
707540	711140	as well since it, you know, it's been on PlayStation VR, so why not?
711140	716260	I love no man's sky. You know, I give that game a lot of support, even when it probably
716260	720340	doesn't deserve it. No, but I do. I love that game. And it's a great comeback story in gaming.
720900	729060	That was like the biggest, like, of course, like, and like, it's like, was it ever a question that
729060	735060	no man's sky would be playable? Like, was anybody out there thinking it wouldn't be playable? Like,
735060	739220	does anyone want to fess up that they, they thought it wouldn't be playable on PlayStation VR
739220	745060	too? Really? Really? So at the very least, they thought like the PlayStation 4 version
745060	749860	would be on PlayStation VR too. So as much as I love that game, that was very much the
749860	756180	refrigerator break because you know, no shit. That game's coming out PlayStation VR too. No shit.
758260	763300	Spider-Man Remastered is coming out on PC. So that's coming out August 12th,
763300	765460	which is kind of surprising. A little less, well.
766180	769380	A little less surprising is because we are getting a lot more of that stuff.
769380	774260	Yeah. We know Sony's been trying to strengthen their PC. I think it's surprising that, oh,
774260	780020	License Marvel Spider-Man is the game that's, so it's interesting to see that confirmed. And
780020	785940	I think just kind of adds to all the pieces last week on, um, you know, Sony strengthening
785940	793940	their PR PC base. Yeah. Uh, we got another trailer for stray, which looks awesome. That's the cyber
793940	799940	punk cat game. It looks really cool. It was so cute. If you're a cat person, that game is so
799940	809460	on your radar and we know it's coming out what July 19th now? Uh, yes. Um, what I thought was
809460	814340	interesting about that is that it's a PlayStation plus, but I think they said only the higher tiers,
814340	820980	right? Not the base tier. Yeah. So that's interesting. Yeah. E3VL points that out too.
820980	827300	Sucks. Not free on PlayStation plus essentials. Um, they have to sweeten the pot on those upper
827300	832100	tiers. So I actually think that's a good move on their part. Uh, and I don't think this will be
832100	837860	the last one. Uh, sure. First party game at all. I don't think it is. I think it's like a second
837860	842740	party studio, but I'm not 100%. Cause if it wasn't, if it was like a third party indie
842740	847060	studio or something like that, it'd be funny if that was, you know, PC game pass or something
847060	855060	like that, you know, included, but I doubt it. Yeah. Um, let's see what else? So we had a roller
855060	860340	drone, which is pretty cool. This is a new game from the developers of Ali Ali world. It's kind
860340	869140	of like this roller skating, um, shooter type game done in like a really retro skates and you
869140	875460	like guns. Boy, do I have the game for you? I do. But the art style was very nice. It does look
875460	882100	cool. Yeah. So that's coming out August 16th. They had new trailer for tunic, which is, um,
882100	886420	speaking of game pass games, but now going the other way around. Right. So this is Microsoft's
886420	890900	uh, going to, uh, thank you. Bobby black Wolf confirms stray is an Annapurna game.
891460	896340	So, and it is releasing on steam the same day. So Annapurna also brought us, um, like there are,
896340	901540	there are good, uh, indie game publisher. Like I want to say, um, Oh my God, what was that music
901540	906260	game that I was obsessed with? Cause the music was so good and it sounded like a church's album.
906260	910260	Um, that was an Annapurna game. And then I like, Oh, I know what you're talking about. I can't
910260	915380	think of the name. Yeah. And then some of the wild hearts. Yes. That was Annapurna to get that.
915380	919620	Um, I believe they did. Everybody's gone to the rapture. I might be wrong. No. Cause that was
919620	926020	Chinese room. Wasn't it? Yes. Yeah. So I, but Annapurna publishes a lot of those indie games,
926020	931940	that 120 minutes I think was them. So there was that. Uh, although if we're talking about stray,
931940	938020	wouldn't that be an Annapurna game? It would be very appropriately.
938500	944020	Uh, we have a new trailer of the coolest, the cholesterol, uh, protocol, and that's, uh, done
944020	950740	by the creators of dead space and it looks very much dead space. So that's, uh, very scary. Not
950740	958260	gonna play that. Um, we got a couple other, that was my looks very scary. Not going to play it very,
958260	963620	very, uh, on brand with my assessment too. Uh, we got another trailer for season,
964580	969860	a letter to the future. Um, that game looks really interesting. Yeah.
970420	974660	I didn't know until, you know, Kotaku and some of the other missed media. So I didn't realize
974660	979460	that was like the indie studio that had some issues behind the scenes development stuff.
980340	985220	So yeah, the game looks very, um, interesting though. And I hope some of those other issues
985220	989380	are resolved as in that boss is no longer around that. I'm I haven't read up on that.
990260	995140	They have a, there was a trailer for a turn nights, which is like a, it looks like a JRPG
995780	1000900	action game with a dating game built in as well. So neat.
1000900	1005300	That's an interesting crossover. I bet the trailer was interesting enough where I'm like,
1005300	1009460	tell me more. I'd like to see what the actual gameplay kind of looks like, but interesting.
1009460	1016500	Yeah. Yeah. Um, what else? We also had a new trailer for final fantasy 16,
1017460	1021220	which is supposed to be coming out sometime in summer of next year. Yeah.
1022340	1027700	I still don't this. It's very confusing to me what the game is going to be. It's like
1027700	1033300	summon, summon, summon, summon, summon, summon. Okay. So I can maybe give a little insight to
1033300	1038260	this from final fantasy 14 and just say that like, not that the two games are necessarily related,
1038820	1043780	but, um, just, I will, I will spoil a, a relatively minor plot point in the
1043860	1047540	heaven's word expansion, which is now, if you haven't played heaven's word yet,
1047540	1053220	you're four expansions behind, right? No three expansions behind. So I kind of think that's on
1053220	1061300	you. Um, so there is a point in heaven's word where Shiva, who is, um, embodied in basically
1061300	1067460	a human character, but she can kind of summon Shiva out of her essence on demand. I'm really
1067460	1073300	simplifying some of the story elements here, uh, takes on a primal or a summon that's summoned by
1073380	1079540	a monster clan called Ravana. And these two summons fight each other. So Shiva and Ravana
1079540	1084260	actually get into a fight and Ravana was a final fantasy 14 original summon, but he's just like,
1084260	1089860	otherwise he's just like, you know, all the other summons. Um, and, uh, they get into a fight and
1089860	1094740	it, that you actually see like, uh, Shiva tried to diamond dust Ravana and all this stuff. And
1094740	1100980	Ravana is like, cause Ravana is like the, the, the four or six armed bug. You've probably seen some
1100980	1105940	screenshots and he has the Russian throat singing background music, which we'll get into the music
1105940	1113700	in a minute. But, um, the, the, um, the, the fight is so good. Like the way it's, it plays out in
1113700	1119220	the game. And I was like, dang, like seeing summons fight each other is actually really
1119220	1123700	awesome. And I remember saying at that point, I wish this was something the series kind of did
1123700	1129780	more of, and that's why now when I look at 16, I'm like, holy shit, somebody heard that. Like,
1129780	1134100	they really are like, it seems like they're making a game where like now in the final fantasy was
1134100	1137460	like the summons are kind of, or it seems like the summons are more like representative of these
1137460	1144020	like warring factions and so forth. But like in 14, they are like, people seem to embody them.
1144020	1148820	So this is, it's very interesting to me. Um, so I'm down with it. The only thing where I'm a
1148820	1153940	little bit like, Oh, that's a disappointment is that it looks like they got rid of parties,
1154580	1160100	at least in the footage we saw that it's like, you're essentially playing alone. Now,
1161620	1167460	14. I mean, yes, there are multiplayer dungeons and multiplayer events. But for the most part,
1167460	1172100	you play a lot of that solo. And I don't think the game hurts because of that. I do know party
1172100	1177140	members come in as NPCs. And I'm hoping there's at least that in this game. But it's a little,
1177860	1182580	it just seems like a core Final Fantasy mechanic that's like missing. But you know,
1182900	1188100	they did co op. That'd be awesome. So I feel like there's still a lot we need to learn there.
1188100	1192820	At the end of the day, even though my brain is like, Okay, I don't know how I feel about this
1192820	1197860	game, not having parties, and that it seems to be actually again, and we're never going to go back
1197860	1203620	to a turn based battle system. There's a part of me that's like, Rob have faith. This is the team
1203620	1209620	that saved the entire fucking franchise. So I'm gonna I'm gonna keep an open mind to all of this
1209620	1215860	because you know what Yoshi P saved Final Fantasy period. So and a lot of these people that he's
1215860	1220340	bringing on are a lot of the teams behind these more recent Final Fantasies that, you know, have
1220340	1226580	been pretty, pretty awesome. So I'm gonna give it a shot. And I think most importantly, most
1226580	1232580	importantly, as far as who's involved in making the game, so can who does the music for 14 is
1232580	1237140	going to do the music for 16. That should have been that was pretty obvious the minute that
1237220	1244100	trailer had the opera song with the names of the Yeah, that's a very soak and thing to do. So it's
1244100	1250020	really but then they confirmed it on like the website later. And I like again, I can't I know
1250020	1255220	a lot of you dodge 14 because it's an MMO with a monthly fee. I understand that you owe it to
1255220	1262820	yourself to still listen to the soundtrack. It is so fucking good that soak and proves he's like the
1262820	1269700	only person capable of replacing noble we Matsu not that we Matsu can ever be replaced. But we all
1269700	1275220	know he's kind of retired as a worthy successor sunset. Yes. So can is absolutely a worthy
1275220	1280820	successor to the Final Fantasy franchise. I'm so fucking excited to hear 16 soundtrack. Like,
1280820	1285220	I'm more I'm more excited for the soundtrack that I am the game, if I can be perfectly honest.
1286260	1292420	So not to again, not to set the bar too high, but I can't help it and help it.
1292420	1297220	I'd still play it, or at least buy it. Because I can't say I will play it for long because like I
1297220	1303220	did 15 I need to go back to 15 dark to see says could they put him on Dragon Quest? I'd be okay
1303220	1308740	with that. God Yes, I would be too. However, the man is only capable of so much. There are some
1308740	1314900	other great composers like 11 had a pair of really good composers that worked with noble Matsu. And
1314900	1320420	so the so there's other composers within square that could take on Dragon Quest. And yes, Dragon
1320420	1327060	Quest badly needs needs a new composer. So you know, sorry, not sorry, like, but outside of the
1327060	1332660	iconic theme, the soundtrack was like by far the weakest point of 11. And it's time to move on.
1333620	1338260	Hopefully the success of Final Fantasy and so kind of push square in that direction. We'll see.
1338260	1345620	We'll see. And keep in mind, Yoshi P came to light and got got prevalent because of Dragon Quest 10.
1345620	1348580	A lot of people don't realize that he didn't produce that game. But he was like the quest
1348580	1353460	and scenario designer for that game. And that's, that's kind of how he started ascending up through
1353460	1360500	Square Enix. So you didn't already know Yoshi P came from Dragon Quest 10, basically. Anyway,
1360500	1362820	um, what are your thoughts on Final Fantasy 16? Loki?
1363540	1366260	I mean, it looks all right. I just don't understand what's going on.
1366820	1374420	That was kind of like 15 ever. You know, no, no, we didn't. I don't think there's ever
1375060	1379300	seven. Seven. I understood what was kind of going on. That was a little easier to follow.
1379300	1382180	Seven. So that was 1997.
1383060	1388980	I think. I think seven. 10 was still kind of okay. Easy to follow.
1389700	1393220	Yeah, 1010. I think I'm kind of knew what to expect. Yeah.
1393220	1395780	But 11. I never knew what was going on.
1395780	1398980	12. No way. Absolutely not.
1398980	1405860	13. No, I got not used with the, with the, the Falsi and the, I don't even know what will see
1405860	1411540	in the Falsi and the sea falls here. Like, I don't know what any of this is. Uh, too, too much lore,
1411540	1418740	too much lore now. Um, yeah. So I think after about 10, like I've lost, have been unable to
1418740	1424980	follow the storyline of that stuff, but I mean, they're, they're pretty good games. Just 15 though,
1424980	1430740	like, like, I don't, I made them old school, the way of thinking. I just, I don't,
1431620	1436420	I don't like the non term-based stuff now seven remake.
1437700	1443620	I know that's great. That's pretty cool. Like, uh, I could maybe deal with something like that,
1443620	1450820	but this doesn't look like that. I don't hate 15, but I think there were some bad decisions
1451380	1458980	due to 15's way too long development that put it, that made it less than what it could have been.
1458980	1464820	And I think it's most apparent when you get Shiva. I'm just going to speak a little like,
1464820	1468100	if you haven't played that game yet and you're sensitive about spoilers, like,
1468100	1472180	I really feel like you probably should have played it by now. And this is, this is relatively minor.
1472180	1477460	Um, but you get Shiva as a summon, just she, she approaches you and the train breaks down
1478020	1484820	and the train breaks down in front of ice caverns. And it's, it's painfully obvious.
1484820	1489860	There was supposed to be a whole sequence there that the train breaks down. You gotta go in the
1489860	1495140	ice caverns, get it, you know, while it gets fixed, you encounter Shiva and figure out,
1495140	1498980	I won't tell you who Shiva really is. Cause you see who Shiva is earlier in the story,
1498980	1502980	but, um, there's a whole, there it's very painfully obvious. There is a whole sequence
1502980	1508740	there gone that I don't even know if they ever got put it in with DLC or whatever.
1508740	1514500	Uh, and then the whole world of ruin at the end, like that could have been,
1514500	1522020	that could have been a upside down Castlevania moment for final fantasy. Truly. That could have
1522020	1526820	been an upside down, like, do y'all remember when Castlevania Symphony of the Night first came out
1526820	1531620	and you first realized that there was an upside down castle? Like if you beat the game the right
1531620	1535300	way and like, it's just like, Oh my God, my fucking mind just exploded because there's a
1535300	1540660	whole nother half of this game to go. Basically final fantasy 15 could have had that and was set
1540660	1545540	up for that. And maybe they finally saw it in the DLC. I don't know because I didn't pay attention
1545540	1550900	that long. And it's very disappointing that it wasn't realized in what they released. But again,
1550900	1555300	it's because they really only had two years to actually develop the game. Yes. It was in
1555300	1560980	development for 10 years. Nah, nah, they hit the reset button. Like with two years to go,
1560980	1565540	maybe three. Anyway, sorry, Loki. I have a lot of tangents tonight.
1566420	1569300	It's okay. I have to make up for Jamie not being here.
1570340	1576100	And then of course, probably the last major thing that they announced as well as Street Fighter VI,
1576100	1581140	they showed off a new trailer with that. So it was less of a teaser trailer, more of like an
1581140	1585620	actual showing gameplay and stuff. And so a lot of interesting things that we saw from that one,
1585620	1589380	they're going to have a single player open world type of gameplay that's in there,
1589380	1595060	which is interesting. They also showed off some new characters as well. So we got to see,
1595860	1602900	of course, you know, some of the staples like Ryu and Chun-Li were in there. And then I can't
1602900	1612100	remember the two other new ones. Was it Jamie and Kimberly, maybe? I don't remember who the
1612100	1617780	other ones are, but so they showed those off. And then of course, it all leaked.
1618980	1625940	All the roster leaked. So there is a screenshot or image, I guess, that had...
1625940	1628900	Chat once to let you know Jamie and Luke were in the trailer.
1628900	1629620	Jamie and Luke. Okay.
1629620	1631700	Kimberly is from this other piece you're talking about.
1632260	1636900	Got it. I couldn't remember what the names were of the different characters. But yeah,
1636900	1641060	so we got the basically looks like the full roster from the game. So a lot of the
1642740	1647620	previous characters coming back with like, definitely like some updated looks and stuff.
1647620	1654500	So you know, we got like Chun-Li looks like Guile, Blanca, Yhonda, Dalzim, Zangief, Ken.
1655380	1659540	But all you need to know is Ryu is daddy now. That's all you need to know. I mean,
1659540	1662420	and he's already been announced. And you already know he's daddy.
1662980	1666980	I feel like the Ken redesign. I think that looks great. And like Dalzim looks great.
1666980	1668180	He's like much older now.
1669380	1674900	Street Fighter is very much destined for the Star Trek legacy where the even numbered ones
1674900	1679060	are the good ones. Like Street Fighter is very much headed for that legacy, isn't it?
1680100	1683940	I don't know. And then they have what looks like DJs back, which is cool.
1684020	1685460	That's cool too. DJs back.
1687540	1691300	And then they have some actual new characters that look pretty interesting as well.
1691300	1695940	So I like to see. I like to see that. I mean, I think it looks like
1695940	1700180	Mike Defton chat says Ken looks like he bought some NFTs and he's going through some tough shit.
1701780	1708100	No, was that the one I saw was great was like it was Ken looks like that when you have the
1708100	1712260	conversation. Oh, you have children. Well, the wife took children. There's something like that.
1712260	1720500	He has that kind of Bobby Blackwell says is Faye Long calling back to a reference a few weeks ago?
1720500	1726500	Well, you know, what didn't leak is DLC. And I'm sure there will be plenty. Oh, yeah. And so,
1726500	1731460	you know, I'm well aware of that story from a few weeks ago where the composer guy maybe
1732020	1736580	opened the door a little too much on his YouTube thing and maybe put his foot in his mouth a little
1736580	1746660	too much. So maybe, maybe Faye Long is released out of pure spite as DLC. Spike can be extremely
1746660	1750180	motivating, but I love Faye Long. I'd be all for it comes out of spite.
1751860	1753380	Pure spite DLC.
1753380	1754900	Yeah. That's funny.
1755540	1760900	Quest Busters sum this up, I believe really well saying so one of the takes I saw about the leaks
1760900	1766340	is that yes, the leaks were bad. But the general sentiment about what has been seen has been really
1766340	1772100	exciting. And I'll sign on with that is that yeah, that fucking sucks for Capcom, because you
1772100	1776100	know, they were going to milk these character announcements right up until the game releases,
1776100	1781060	and they were probably going to unveil someone else at summer game fest this week. So you know
1781060	1787060	what, and they still could, you know, it's not like they can't just show deeper dive, deeper dives,
1787060	1793860	the ultimates backstory, show them in the story mode that still has a lot of question marks,
1793940	1798100	the open world stuff they're showing. I think there's still ways they can do that and make it
1798100	1803060	exciting. But yeah, it's kind of like, wow, that sucks for them that it leaked out. But actually,
1803060	1809460	like, I can't think of what could get people more excited about Street Fighter six, because the
1809460	1816340	designs are so good. When all anyone was talking about after that first trailer was the the stock
1816340	1822420	logo thing and now which they changed the logo. I think the logo looks much better. It's great.
1822420	1827380	So at least they heard. Wow. It's like, everybody saw what happened after the first Sonic the
1827380	1831860	Hedgehog movie trailer. And now they're like, maybe we should fix mistakes that the internet
1831860	1838980	points out. That worked very well for Sonic will stuff that like, yeah, it's like, very obvious.
1838980	1843620	But like, yeah, it's definitely I just like the whole Roman numeral six that rotates like that
1843620	1848660	was very clever. Very clever. It is clever, much more clever than, you know, stock photo stuff.
1848660	1856260	Great. So yeah, looks exciting. Yeah, we'll have to see more.
1856260	1859940	Yeah, I still want to see more of the game, which I'm gonna be honest, I think I downloaded Street
1859940	1866420	Fighter five as like a PS plus. I played it maybe one time and I was like meh. But like, so I'm like,
1866420	1871620	way more enthused with what I'm seeing of Street Fighter six so far. Again, these characters again,
1871620	1880340	real hot. Really? Like, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry to gay it up, but I'm not happy, right? Like,
1880340	1891220	there's like real hot. If you're gonna cosplay Daddy Ryu, call me like, it's this is Yeah. Anyway,
1891220	1898180	but all the characters look really good in those those leaks, you know? So yeah, it's very exciting.
1898180	1901780	For sure. Even the new characters, you know, they all looked the ones I was looking at
1901780	1905300	would look really cool. So yeah. And of course, they had to be pointed out by
1905300	1910580	the horn dogs on the internet that Chung Li now has butt physics as well. So, you know,
1911540	1919380	keeping realistic, or keeping the realism. All right, cool. Cool story. But yeah, it's not just
1919380	1924420	an instead the chat is saying, you know, down boy down the thirst is strong. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But
1924420	1929620	the reality is, like, I'm just excited to see some of these like, like character reinventions,
1929620	1934260	like seeing DJ back, I think is super cool. Because like, has DJ been in Street Fighter since?
1934900	1939540	I guess he must have shown up in four eventually, because four had like, literally everybody at one
1939540	1944980	point. But like, I feel like, you know, he's been gone for a while. And, you know, just some of
1944980	1948740	these other characters coming back, because he Honda was always my favorite in the original Street
1948740	1952260	Fighter two, because I would just do his hundred hand slap over and over. And he looks really
1952260	1959700	different. And that's pretty cool. So yeah, love it. Yeah. Tiger class says, so Chun Li now has a
1959700	1967300	thick butt to go with those thighs. Sure. All right. All right. Yeah, sure. All right. Let's
1967300	1973620	move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks, and the types of games that we've been playing this
1973620	1978500	week as we sit on our thick butts and play some video games. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1979300	1982580	Um, it's all Minecraft again. I mean, it's always,
1983220	1985220	but you had a new video. So we know it's productive.
1985220	1991940	Yes, it's always very busy to that, like video took at least like, 10 hours to edit. So there
1991940	1997540	was a lot to go through trying to whittle it down to even the 40 minutes that it is, because they
1997540	2003380	keep getting longer. But like I, it's pretty concise now, or at least trying to get a concise,
2003380	2009540	but there's a lot to show. So yeah, that just came out. And then I did want to update since
2009540	2016660	it's over now the bundle for the top and I got distracted. Yeah, yeah. Yes. So we've raised
2016660	2026100	$2,809. Not hundreds of thousands of dollars, but it's only 30 games. So it's all good. But yeah,
2026100	2031060	so in a couple weeks, I'll be donated. I know that the guy Nate Peters, who's in charge of
2031060	2036740	everything he's I guess there's you much like steam and everything you have to wait for like
2036740	2042980	seven days for refunds not to be issued and seven more days for like payments to be issued and stuff.
2042980	2048340	So he's taking care of all of the depositing for that stuff. But yeah, lots of bundles being sold
2048340	2058180	and notifications going off like crazy on on each IO. So I think we sold probably like at least 150
2058180	2066260	of those bundles. That's great. Congratulations. Yeah. Awesome. All right, that's it. Great.
2067060	2071700	Let's see. So for my gaming week, so I played Mario Fantasy 14, because of course I did,
2071700	2078260	I always play that game. I also did, you know, my AR games, I was doing an event in Ingress,
2078260	2082100	and I actually went all the way to the gold level. So it took a little bit of walking and doing all
2082100	2087860	that stuff. But I had fun with that. Been walking my Pikmin, I'm almost to level 59 in Pikmin Bloom.
2088580	2094420	And I played Pokemon go because this weekend was the big Pokemon go fest, right, the the annual
2094420	2099140	festival, which went global in the year 2020 for obvious reasons, but they had, you know, pretty
2099140	2104500	good success with the global event in 2020. Last year was a $5 event that was pretty well received
2104500	2110260	for the price. This year, the price went back up to $15. And, you know, I was looking at like,
2110260	2114660	what all they were doing. And I was like, Well, I feel like I have a lot of these Pokemon, there's
2114660	2119780	maybe only like one truly new one in this event for me. And I'm I don't know, whatever, I'll do
2119780	2127700	it. And so I bought a ticket for the event. And I regret it. This event was trash. This event was
2127700	2132980	trash. I should say I should say this event was not worth what Niantic charged for it,
2132980	2138420	especially coming off of the $5 price tag last year, which I understand was a tie in to the
2138420	2146580	fifth anniversary. But that's, you know what, this event was worth maybe $5. I can't fucking
2146580	2154340	believe that I walked nine miles yesterday, and got six shinies from that. Whereas last year,
2154340	2161780	when I went to San Francisco, I maybe walked six or seven miles. And I think I ended the day with
2161780	2168580	like 23 shinies. Now, it doesn't have to be all about shinies. But they are desirable. Well,
2168580	2173620	unless you're Shane, but if they are desirable, they are nice, they are fun to collect,
2173620	2178180	they are a more advanced part of the game to collect, they're a rarer thing. And I just,
2178900	2186580	what pisses me off is that Niantic was really dangling the carrot of, well, Axew's going shiny,
2186580	2190580	and there's unknowns that are going to be shiny. And there's all these things that are going to be
2190580	2199380	shiny for the event. You know what, I think Niantic broke loot box laws, quite frankly,
2199380	2204100	with that because they need to disclose, especially because they were selling us,
2204100	2209220	they need to disclose what was really the percentage there of shinies. And maybe it's
2209220	2214500	confirmation bias because I didn't get as many shinies. But looking around on social media and
2214500	2219220	stuff, I don't think a lot of people did walk out of that event with a lot of shinies. Thank you,
2219220	2224660	Def says six yesterday, three today on the shinies. Oh, I got one today on a three mile walk.
2224660	2229860	And they're shitty shinies too. I'm sorry, but they are because they, like, at least three of
2229860	2236980	them that I got were previous community day shinies. Like I got CDot, WooHoo. I got Shviel,
2236980	2241940	which was also a previous community day. So it was like, it was just very frustrating. At least
2241940	2246580	I finally got a Wingull. I do like shiny Wingull, but it's not exactly an A tier shiny either.
2247540	2253220	Okay, so it doesn't have to just be about shinies. Fine. They put Axew in one star raids,
2253220	2257540	which was cool. It was nice to see that. I wish maybe they'd put some of the other like that
2257540	2264180	Jango. Oh, Jango. Oh, whatever that name should have probably been a one stars as well. And maybe
2264180	2268500	a couple of the other really hard to get like one stars that needed not a lot of candy. Maybe Noi
2268500	2274740	Bat would have been great to see in raids. I just think the raids were super underwhelming. And what
2274740	2280740	the fuck were the Alolan Pokemon doing in the rotation from hour to hour when we just had an
2280740	2287860	event focused on them? Like it's just, it's for free. Yeah. SG100Matt says I don't want to sound
2287860	2292500	like I should expect anything but considering we spent $15 they could have had better rates than
2292500	2299860	this. I think when you spend $15 you can expect to get $15 worth. And this event was not worth $15.
2300820	2305860	Now I guess they put another new Pokemon in raids today. You didn't need a raid ticket to get it.
2305860	2310020	In fact, you didn't need a raid ticket for the Axew's either. What did the raid ticket holders
2310020	2317620	really get out of this? Maybe more unknowns, Torkoal and Tropius. A couple of regionals
2317620	2321060	that I bet most people that didn't do the event will just trade for anyway.
2321060	2330820	I mean, what did the $15 really get us? Not much. Oh, yeah, the incense rules. They did take
2330820	2335220	so Chas reminded the incense rules changed over the weekend back to what they were before
2335220	2339700	basically. And yeah, things would constantly just spawn. Oh, that was so annoying. Like I
2339700	2344420	would be like, Oh, because I really, really wanted more shiny unknowns. That's the one thing I really
2344420	2349540	wanted was more shiny unknowns. I would see an unknown spawn, I tap it, it would disappear.
2349540	2355300	Thanks to some stupid bug that was going on in the game. So just it was it was a shitty event
2355300	2361460	and Niantic should feel bad for charging $15 for that. Now, I guess there is something about
2361460	2366500	there's a second half of the event coming in August. So there's supposed to be like an encore
2366500	2372900	event in August. August better fucking blow me away after this weekend. So I don't know what
2372900	2378420	they're saving up for. But it better knock my fucking socks off after this release. Because
2378420	2382660	yeah, it's it's really making me reconsider buying into the hype in the future. And I feel
2382660	2389140	really stupid for having done it this time to be quite honest. Speaking of things I feel stupid for
2389140	2393140	I wasn't sure if I was going to mention this on the show or not, but I'm gonna I'm gonna say
2393860	2400660	I did a thing that I said before I didn't think I was gonna do. I played Diablo mortal.
2400660	2411300	I know. Why did I do it? I Well, I've always loved Diablo. Be the other situation with what's
2411300	2416740	going on at Blizzard and everything is really complicated. I we all we all know very much how
2416740	2420500	I feel about Bobby Kotick and I feel about a lot of the management over at Activision Blizzard.
2421700	2429940	That hasn't changed. I know people, people as in more than one that had involvement with this game.
2430740	2436900	And where do you kind of draw the line between? I want to support you even though I fucking can't
2436900	2442180	stand your boss. It's like where where do you draw the line? So at the end of the day, I was like,
2442180	2446100	you know what, and and actually, and I will say this, I'm gonna say this to Diablo immortals
2446100	2455300	credit, huge credit is after that whole debacle at E or sorry, not E3 Blizzcon. In 2017, or whenever
2455300	2458260	it was that they announced was 18. I don't remember anymore whenever they announced that game
2458980	2463780	with the whole don't you all have phones. They did backtrack at the end of the day,
2463780	2470020	and they put the game out on PC as well, stating, if we don't do this, people are just going to use
2470020	2475060	Android emulators to play the game. So we might as well just put out an official version of this
2475060	2483220	on PC. I think that was a very accurate and very perceptive and very welcomed change in thinking.
2483220	2491300	And I want to support a change in thinking. So I did I did not download the phone version,
2491300	2496180	I downloaded the PC version. And I played that and spend any money on it. I'm not necessarily
2496180	2501540	wearing that as a badge of honor. It's just I and yet I am. I am, folks, I am well aware of
2501540	2507300	that copy pasted headline about you can spend $110,000 in Diablo immortal to max out your
2507300	2511300	character. And I think we have a story up coming up on it later. So I'm not gonna get too far into
2511300	2517540	that. For me so far, in my experience, it has been very easy to just not buy anything at all
2517540	2522580	and focus on the main scenario. Am I going to have the strongest character and the strongest weapons?
2522580	2529220	No. Is that going to bother me? No. And I just have to make sure it doesn't bother me. And that
2529220	2535300	I'm okay with not being the very best that no one ever was. That's Pokemon. And that's where I do
2535300	2540580	get suckered into spending money where maybe I shouldn't have. But um, yeah, Diablo immortal.
2541140	2546340	It's fine enough. I've played up to level like 25. And it actually has kind of like a fully fleshed
2546340	2551620	out main scenario quest that has like voice acting. It's like not just about like the grind
2551620	2559780	of rifts and so forth. So I was just I, I'm, I kind of wish and I maybe they'll regret to maybe
2559860	2565940	do this later. I don't know. I think if they had just put this out as a $40 PC game without the
2565940	2571060	micro transaction stuff, I almost wonder how much better this would have been received. If they just
2571060	2578020	put it out as a $40 PC game, where hey, when you buy it, you get a code to put it on your phone
2578020	2582980	as well. So it can be both phone and that stuff. I wonder how much better received this whole thing
2582980	2587540	would have been if that was the route they went. But I know I know I know. That's not business,
2587540	2592980	Rob. That's not how EA makes their money. That's not your loot boxes are where Yeah, yeah, yeah,
2592980	2598020	I get it. I get it. I'm just saying, maybe this whole thing would have got a lot less shit.
2598980	2604180	And maybe as a result, make more money in the long run. If that was the route they went,
2604180	2609700	and who's to say they won't still end up going that route. Especially with Microsoft now in the
2609700	2615380	picture. I wonder what game pass perks I'm going to get for Diablo immortal eventually, maybe a
2615380	2622180	year from now. We'll see. Questbuster and chat says Diablo mortals PC client is still a bit jank,
2622180	2626740	but it works well enough, at least in my case. Yeah, I agree. Some of the loading times are
2626740	2630820	pretty shit. Maybe that's because I'm not running it off a solid state drive. I don't know. Or maybe
2630820	2636500	it is literally an Android emulator. I don't know. But it's not terrible. And you can use a gamepad.
2636500	2641060	I just I use keyboard mouse because like Diablo, I just feel like that's the way to play it.
2641060	2646180	Questbuster also says, I played through the entire campaign and unlocked paragon.
2646180	2649940	The monetization doesn't really feel as if it hurts until I got to that point.
2651060	2656820	S2100 Matt says considering this closed out of Blizzcon one year and was billed as a big deal.
2656820	2660900	Now it's a loot box nonsense thing that's kind of hurt the franchise to some degree.
2663060	2667940	Here's the weird thing about that. Again, I want to say I've been playing this game for a few hours
2667940	2673860	and have easily been able to ignore all these loot box mechanics. And Questbuster just told you,
2673860	2678420	I went through the entire campaign and unlock Paragon. And that's when I started
2678420	2682660	feeling the loot box stuff. Yeah, because you unlock the loot box stuff.
2684580	2687460	Like they they don't start offering it to you until you get further in the game.
2688340	2693220	Not all of it like those legendary crest crest. I have access to him now. And the game tried to
2693220	2698580	push a 99 cent first timer bundle on me and other stuff, but it's very easy to say no.
2699700	2707300	So I don't know. So yeah, my feelings on Diablo Immortal are a bit complicated, but I do feel
2708660	2715460	the $110,000 headline is a little, I can't believe I'm going to say this. I think that
2715460	2721620	headline is a little unfair. But I do think, and the reason why I say that is that you don't have
2721620	2726260	to upgrade every legendary gem because they don't all make sense for all the classes.
2727140	2733140	But I understand the desire to drag Activision Blizzard for a lot of this loot box nonsense when
2733140	2739140	it could have just been a $40 game. And I think we would all be speaking very differently of this
2739140	2745060	game if it was just a $40 game on PC that happened to be on mobile phones as well. So that part I'm
2745060	2752420	absolutely going to agree with. But I do think that $110,000 figure that's being copy pasted
2752420	2759940	is a little bit like, I think you're kind of, you're kind of stating a scenario that's not
2759940	2765780	really going to happen to anyone. But I don't know. Then again, I'm not a high streamer that's,
2766340	2770580	or high rank streamer who's maybe high as well. I don't know. I'm not a high rank streamer who's
2770580	2774260	willing to drop $500 on a stream because that's how much money they're making in bits and subs
2774260	2780820	during a stream anyway. So I don't know. Anyway. Questbuster says it's so easy to ignore the
2780820	2785300	monetization, but when you want to perfect your gear post campaign, it feels like they've heavily
2785300	2789700	targeted that. So you have to be able to say, I don't need to be perfect. And I'm just going to
2789700	2796980	play this for fun is the impression I get. Anyway. So that's my thoughts on that. Let's move on.
2796980	2801700	Let's talk about what else is going on in the gaming world this week with some headlines.
2801700	2805700	And, uh, Sony, not the only one to put out a little video this week, right? Logie?
2806900	2813300	Uh, that's correct. Yeah. So there's a cool announcement with, uh, the mega drive mini two.
2814100	2820260	It's, um, it's interesting. They have quite a few games in there. I like how that they have
2820260	2824420	all these mini systems that can, that you can actually stack them together. So they had
2824420	2833380	previously like a mini 32 X and, uh, was it the mini? Um, I'm not sure what they have,
2833380	2838820	like a other separate, I know you can get a Sega CD attachment to it as well. Um, but yeah,
2838820	2845060	this new mega drive two mini has gonna only be available in Japan right now. It's going to run
2845060	2850340	you 4,500 yen and they've got some of the game. I think some of the games have been announced for
2850340	2859780	this so far. So we've got, it looks like, um, was it silphied, uh, sonic CD, uh, shiny for CD.
2860740	2867540	Uh, it looks like we've got Virtua racing, uh, but it ends up brothers thunder forest for,
2868820	2873380	uh, it looks like fantasy zone. Jamie would be very excited about that.
2873380	2878180	Which is interesting because that wasn't even on the Genesis. That was a master system game.
2878740	2883380	Right. These are, these are, so, uh, this is a mega drive cartridge and so there's,
2883380	2887380	uh, mega drive cartridge and mega CD games kind of mixed together.
2887380	2892660	Yeah, but it wasn't, it wasn't even on Genesis. Like it was, so I, I think this must be a prototype
2892660	2895780	that they had at one point that they fully realized. I don't know, but it's just,
2895780	2897620	it's just interesting. It's an interesting addition.
2899060	2903540	Yeah. I think it's like their redesign, uh, console, like, you know how, like the Genesis
2903860	2908980	are eventually kind of, you know, they, they changed the design of it a little bit.
2909540	2913540	So it's like this, and then of course this has the six button controller that they
2914260	2918500	got on that system much later as well. So pretty cool.
2919860	2923620	Jamie was here tonight because these are a lot of these are games. She's probably featured half
2923620	2927700	these games as classic games a week. And, you know, she, uh, is very passionate about the old
2927700	2931540	Sega stuff. So I'll have to ask her thoughts on that next week. But, um, even I, as a,
2932420	2936420	who is always more a Nintendo household and kind of missed the Sega CD and all that stuff,
2936420	2938740	like there's a lot of stuff in here where even I'm like,
2938740	2940900	damn, I kind of want to get this. It sounds like a great lineup.
2942260	2947540	Yeah. So it's supposed to come with 50 games. So obviously they haven't announced all of the games
2947540	2953860	that are going to be in it. Um, and then along with that though, they added, um, I think though
2953860	2957780	they're talking about, yeah, they're just talking about basically the Sega CD, how there's enhanced
2957780	2963460	graphics and stuff. So going to be, you know, USB powered HDMI, that type of stuff. So, um,
2963460	2964740	pretty cool looking though. Yeah.
2966420	2970740	I want one. Hopefully I can get one. Hopefully they're not too hard to get. Um,
2970740	2975700	a lot of people were curious why they weren't doing a Dreamcast mini or a Saturn mini,
2975700	2979060	but I guess they came out and said it would have been too expensive in light of, you know,
2979060	2984660	the chip shortage going on in the world or whatever. I'm a little surprised at that. Yeah.
2984660	2989700	I'm hoping maybe they're just saving that for maybe another year or two or whatever. Um, and,
2989700	2993780	and we'll see that eventually. I think that would be great, but this is, this is a pretty,
2993780	2998500	this is still a pretty decent lineup, you know, for stretching out the Genesis another year. Right.
2999540	3004100	So, yeah. So, yeah. And like I said, um, so the cost actually is a 99,
3004100	3012580	80 yen or about $75. The 4,500 yen was actually for a non-functional matching Sega CD add-on.
3012580	3018020	It's just cosmetic, but if you want to make your, your, uh, make it drive to look like
3018740	3025540	it's docked to a Sega CD, you can, and that even comes with like a tiny virtual racing cartridge
3025540	3032100	and a Sonic CD, Sonic the Hedgehog DD disc that goes into the CD drive, which is kind of funny.
3032100	3037860	Yeah. I think, I think, uh, I think this thing will be cute. I want, I hope they bring it over
3037860	3041860	here. I know it's Japan only right now, but, um, maybe we'll hear in the next month that it's got,
3041860	3044740	I mean, maybe this is what Sega wants to talk about at Summer Game Fest. I don't know. Who
3044740	3050580	knows? We'll see. Yeah. All right. Well back to Diablo Immortal talk for a minute because Diablo
3050580	3054420	Immortal has been in the headlines, um, in a lot of places, not just that headline I was talking
3054420	3059620	about with, um, how much it costs to max up a character. Um, but, uh, about where Diablo
3059620	3064180	Immortal is not releasing, and that is Belgium or the Netherlands. Uh, these countries are not
3064180	3070980	getting Diablo Immortal. Um, and, uh, it's probably because of local laws pertaining to loot boxes.
3070980	3079300	Uh, and, uh, Blizzard not really looking to change that. Um, so on the Diablo Immortal subreddit,
3079300	3083860	a Blizzard game master kind of set, and they obviously they're not naming names for reasons,
3083860	3087700	kind of said, like what's going on with this saying, quote, the loot boxes in the game are
3087700	3092580	against the law in your country. So unless the gambling restrictions change, the game will not
3092580	3096980	be released in the Netherlands and Belgium. Um, and this is probably because, you know, again,
3096980	3101540	you can buy a greater rift key or whatever the hell they call it, legendary rift modifier key,
3101540	3105140	whatever it's called in that game. Um, you can buy that, but it doesn't really guarantee that
3105140	3109700	you're going to get anything. It just ups the odds on a lot of stuff, which I kind of, I kind
3109700	3114340	of think is a bullshit thing to begin with, but, um, is it any different than Pokemon go? Clearly
3114340	3120740	not. Um, so, uh, this is where we're at. So, um, yeah, it's not going to be released in those
3120740	3125060	countries for those reasons. I think there probably should be more transparency in all
3125060	3129460	countries, uh, on Blizzard's part with this, to be quite honest, and with all gaming companies,
3129460	3136580	I think odds and that sort of thing should be a default thing. Like why the odds should be very
3136580	3147460	clear from, in everything. Um, but yeah. So the games are of the mindset. Don't tell me the odds.
3147460	3152420	So, you know, that's true. Yeah. If you, if you know the, uh, but the other thing that Diablo
3152660	3158820	like, there are just so many items that do different things. And it's like, you have
3158820	3164740	your pay to win currency that can buy so many items. I've heard this called the hot dogs in
3164740	3170740	the bun thing before. And it's very true, but like, it goes beyond the fact that like, you know,
3170740	3177220	six or $5 will get you 600 of this, but which really translates to four of these, you know,
3177460	3182980	it's just like the math really gets convoluted, um, in that game. And that's why I've just said,
3182980	3186420	you know what, I'm just never going to give this game my credit card info. And the nice
3186420	3193780	thing about it being on a PC standalone client, they don't have it. So I can't spend money.
3193780	3198420	They have my old, the guess what the credit card Blizzard has on file for when I did pay for wow,
3198420	3202580	many years ago, that card expired. So they don't have any credit card for me right now. So
3202980	3205940	there you go. All right, what else do we have? Loki?
3207380	3213700	All right. And so we talked about this last week about how Microsoft said they would acknowledge
3213700	3221700	the raven software union that they had there for the QA department, but now they wanted to
3221700	3228740	go a little bit further with that. This is a comment now from Brad Smith with Microsoft
3229540	3237540	saying that not only are they going to acknowledge the current union, but any unions going forward,
3238820	3245700	they're going to acknowledge those as well, or recognize those, I should say not necessarily
3245700	3250420	acknowledge. Breslin said, you know, our employees do not need to organize to have a dialogue with
3250420	3255220	Microsoft leaders. But we also recognize the workplace is changing. That's why we are sharing
3255220	3262980	principles to guide our approach with labor organizations. And then they link to all that.
3264660	3272020	So at least that's better than, you know, Activision Blizzard trying to stamp out unions.
3272020	3277700	Well, and I think Microsoft also sees that this is something they can get ahead of and just accept
3277700	3281780	as where the industry kind of read the tea leaves and see that this is where the industry is going
3281780	3286100	to be going. And either they can, you know, get on board and try to get ahead of it and
3286100	3289140	try to figure out what it means for them and how can they get they can best work with that,
3289140	3294580	or they can kick and scream and just look dumb, you know, like a lot of other companies are at
3294580	3300500	this point. So, you know, kudos to Microsoft for continuing to get it. And Phil Spencer,
3300500	3305380	specifically, to be honest. So, boy, it's going to be interesting if he ever leaves.
3306500	3309700	Not that I wish that but you know, it's just going to be it's going to be very interesting,
3309700	3314420	you know, heaven forbid Microsoft get another Don Mattrick in there. It's just it's so interesting
3314420	3318500	how who's at the top can really trickle down into the rest of the culture, huh?
3319380	3324580	Yeah, as to 100. Matt, agreeing with me in chat, saying times are changing,
3324580	3329460	the industry is going, it's either they get in front of it and support it as best as possible,
3329460	3335540	or be the jerk and try to suppress it. DJ Romas says, granted, the MS retail stores could be
3335540	3342660	unionized. But on the corporate side, not really no. So well, you know, like a lot of retail
3342660	3347220	efforts to unionize as well, you know, look at what's going on with Starbucks and all that. So
3348660	3353620	we'll see. Anyway, let's move on to another big gaming headline from this week and another video
3353620	3358580	announcement. And that has to do with Pokemon Scarlet and violet. That's right, we got a new
3358580	3363380	trailer for Pokemon Scarlet and violet this week. And it was just a few minutes. But boy,
3363380	3369380	do they cram a lot into those few minutes. For example, we got to see that there are not one but
3369380	3375220	two new professors because it depends on which version of the game you pick up. So yeah, Professor
3375220	3380580	Sada, and you have Professor Turo. And again, it depends which version of the game you pick up
3380580	3388580	which one you're going to get. Professor Sada is kind of like a prehistoric Lee dressed female
3388580	3393380	professor, kind of like Laura Dern in Jurassic Park. Why don't we just say she's Laura Dern in
3393380	3399540	Jurassic Park basically. And then Professor Turo is a male character that looks like Tron
3400420	3405860	a little bit. So like we'll say, you know, Garrett, what's his name and Tron. So so there's,
3406580	3411140	there's, it's interesting that you have prehistoric and you have Tron, it kind of makes
3411140	3416740	it look like there's a past and a future sort of storyline that's going on here. I should also point
3416740	3421620	out that the internet has decided both of these professors are hot. And if you're bisexual,
3421620	3427700	you're having a really good week, because both of these professors are quite bangable. According to
3427700	3436180	the world of fan art. I'm just, Loki, I'm just gonna say, I've seen some art about Professor
3436180	3442180	Turo already. It's, it's amazing what the internet can do in six hours, but at the same time,
3443140	3447940	not surprising whatsoever. But I'm just gonna say Pokemon anymore. It's just thirst them on.
3448820	3454500	Yeah, that's definitely people want to be poked. I've just that's what I've got to say. Because
3454500	3460580	people have their fan images already. And you know, if you thought Ryu was a daddy,
3460580	3467620	wait, it's almost like I saw the best. The best picture I saw was a clip. It said it had Professor
3467620	3475700	Turo. But the chat box the text was taken out to instead put in Hi, gay. I don't know if you've
3475700	3481700	ever seen that Twitter thing. Hi, gay. Come on down to the butter shop. And it's so fucking
3481700	3491700	funny. Loki. I'm telling you, it's really funny. All right. All right. Let's see. DJ Rama says
3491700	3497300	future Professor Turo cosplay. I'm flattered that you think I could even pull it off. I'm
3497300	3502660	truly flattered. Maybe. Who knows DragonCon. I bet there will be lots of that cosplay at
3502660	3509700	DragonCon. And I'm a okay for that. So anyway. Oh, yes, we need what else was in the trailer
3509700	3516660	besides thirsty professors. We got to see just a little bit of your rival in that game. We saw that
3516660	3521940	there is a interesting connect with your friends and you can go out on adventures together up to
3521940	3527540	four people at a time. So it actually has like multiplayer gameplay in there for like trading
3527540	3532100	and battling, but also exploring with other players, which is interesting. So it's almost
3532100	3538900	like they ironically coming off of talking about Diablo. It almost sounds like they kind of have
3538900	3543380	that spin on it, which I think will be very interesting to see, quite frankly, so I'm excited
3543380	3550340	to see that. And then there are some old Pokemon that have been confirmed. So Gengar, Talonflame,
3551060	3559620	Chewtle, Venonat, Cryogonal, Larvitar, Bagon, Pikachu, Toxapex, Coalossal. So we don't know
3559620	3566180	if the Scarlet Violet decks will have everything because we know how the internet got really upset
3566180	3570500	when Pokemon Sword and Shield didn't have everything. So we don't know if we're going to
3570500	3575140	see that this time, but we did get to see some other new Pokemon, including, yes,
3575860	3584180	a cute little pig Pokemon named Lechonk. Now, while most of us are taking that to mean haha
3584180	3591060	chonk, lechonk haha. Many people are also pointed out that like Mike Defton in our chat says,
3591060	3596500	also Lechonk's name comes from Lechon. I don't know if I'm saying that right, which is literally
3596500	3603300	pig in Spanish. So yes, there are probably some very tongue in cheek sort of things there in the
3603300	3608660	like, I heard Professor Turo could have come from Futuro as well, which is like a way of saying
3608660	3616580	future. There's also a new Pokemon Pomi, which is like a little electric dog or something that
3616580	3623220	looked really cute. And I'm sorry, I loved Smallive, which yes, was a little olive that
3623220	3634180	was small. It's adorable. Smallive. S-M-O-L-I-V. Smallive. Anyway, yeah, so I think it looked
3634180	3640020	super cute. I'm really excited to get my hands on this game. So and I'm not even Shane or generally
3640020	3644180	one that like gets super excitable about Pokemon, but I enjoyed my time with Sword and Shield and
3644180	3651380	I'm excited for this one as well. Zenmonkey11 says, this game sounds like there isn't going
3651380	3657940	to be much to do offline, which sucks. I don't think the multiplayer was required by any means.
3657940	3665700	And if you think about it, there was in Sword and Shield, you had those raids,
3666260	3672500	which was up to four people, right? But if you didn't have online people, you would get really
3672500	3679940	terrible NPCs that never did the right move. So if you want to put up with that you sure can.
3680660	3685380	Yeah, so single player I think will be fine. You'll still have a story to get through,
3685380	3690420	start to finish. It's just multiplayer is just another way you could do it. And maybe will be
3690420	3696020	a way to get better things. Now I'm curious how it's going to work. Will Scarlet and Violet
3696660	3702340	be playable together multiplayer? And how does that work if you're getting different Pokemon?
3702340	3708580	So I'm curious how that all plays out. Like can I play Scarlet and Mike Deft play Violet,
3708660	3713460	then we can play together even though like every gay I know wants to get Pokemon Violet now for
3713460	3718820	obvious reasons. I feel like I want to get Scarlet just so I have people to trade with.
3720500	3725860	Plus I like I like Sada. I thought I think she's a neat design. So I don't have to thirst after all
3725860	3734660	my characters and video games. Just sometimes. All right. Moving on. S200Matt says Shane will play
3734660	3740340	both games at once with himself online. Absolutely true. He will allow his husband to play with him,
3740340	3745220	I'm pretty sure. But otherwise, yes. All right. Anyway, moving on. Loki.
3746420	3754260	So there's been some drama going on in the PC game collection. I'm seeing where apparently
3754260	3762020	on my internet, yes, drama. Apparently, there is a person by the name of Enrico Riccardi,
3762020	3771140	who had for years been counterfeiting a sealed box games in the PC market and selling them.
3771940	3778820	And so apparently now folks had started to pay attention to what he had sold them. And
3779620	3783300	they're finding that the other discs that are blank, there's I didn't mean to have the
3783300	3789780	sound effects behind you. Sorry. I'm setting up for another segment. There's stuff that they
3789780	3796980	could tell that were printed like on a dot matrix printer or something like that. There is autographs
3796980	3807380	that were forged. So it's, it's a mess as far as what has happened here. Even a couple of the games
3807380	3814260	had gone through Wada, that grading company, and they had graded them like a okay. Even though
3814260	3821300	they're fake. So Wada, of course, is like, Oh, hey, hey, we'll look at those again. But apparently,
3821300	3830500	they're saying that since 2015, he's roughly been involved with $107,000 worth of transactions.
3832500	3836580	I guess I did play appropriate noise for collectors getting scammed. So there is
3836580	3844180	that. So it was the game over noise and Mario. So anyway, because it's at the start of a video
3844180	3851220	for an upcoming segment here. But yeah, let's see. Mike deaf says I remember PSA grading a
3851220	3857780	fake Pokemon card with a 10. So yeah, that some some fakes are really convincing. So you got to
3857780	3863300	be care. I don't know. Like I, I would be very careful getting into this market right now.
3863300	3869940	Well, and considering though that like, with that, like, it's also hard to tell like,
3870660	3875860	when that stuff seal like, if you're not going to open up, see if the disc is legit or not,
3875860	3881540	you're looking at the box like, yeah, that's, you know, correct. I don't know. No, for sure.
3884100	3889060	I don't think I'll be buying any classics. Well, unless it's like a game I want to play for like
3889060	3893940	12 bucks on the shelf for 15 bucks, but not hundreds of thousands of dollars anytime soon.
3893940	3898020	That's for sure. Because the whole thing seems scammy. It's almost as scammy as NFTs.
3898020	3903540	So yeah. Anyway, let's get to it. Let's get to it. Let's go back to a time when
3904740	3906340	video games weren't so scammy.
3917140	3922100	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault
3922100	3927540	and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
3928980	3934580	Well, actually Dark Soccer, you won't be telling people about it tonight. I will. And the classic
3934580	3942180	game of the week that I've chosen tonight is Pitfall. Usually I will, I know Dark Soccer loves
3942180	3947700	to pick a game that came out like right at the cutoff, which is 10 years ago. So like a game
3947700	3956500	that's 10 years older or more. Pitfall, the game I've picked tonight is 40 years old. So here's
3956580	3961620	the game. Yes, this game came out in August of 1982. So this is a 40 year old game that I've
3961620	3966340	picked. And Mike Defton chat says, or I'm sorry, also SEO in her matter, like really, we haven't
3966340	3974740	done Pitfall. I did Pitfall 2, the sequel a long time ago, like in the 400s somewhere along there,
3974740	3980740	one of the earlier classic games that I picked. But no, we have not discussed the original Pitfall,
3981380	3986260	or at least it's not on the wiki, in which case it didn't happen. So yeah, this is an
3986500	3992500	a lot of people of course, recognize this classic because this is a definitive 1982 classic game for
3992500	3997860	sure. This is a game that was created by Activision back when it was good, or at least published
3997860	4003700	Activision. The designer of this game, of course, was the famous David Crane, who was a really famous
4003700	4009140	designer because of games like Pitfall back in the 80s. In this game, of course, you are controlling
4009140	4014820	a character named Pitfall Harry was the character's name and he ended up kind of becoming a little bit
4014820	4019860	of a B-tier character later on. You saw him in other things and, you know, he was a mascot of
4019860	4026020	sorts for a certain time. You go through this world with basically an upstairs and a downstairs.
4026020	4030740	There's the overworld and there's the caves. And you can see both on the same screen. And there
4030740	4038100	are 255 screens that you're going through. Wow, it's two to the power of what, eight? So everything
4038100	4042660	is always two to the power of something in these old games, right? So 256 is that, you know, the
4043300	4049780	magic number. These screens are connected to the left and to the right. So some people may argue
4049780	4054420	it is easier to run to the left in this game. It all depends on how you want to play it.
4055220	4061220	The goal of this game is to collect treasure and run an entire loop through the game. You're
4061220	4067300	trying to get 32 treasures in the jungle in 20 minutes. It's harder than you think because you
4067300	4073300	have to use the caves underground in order to do it because the caves kind of move you ahead
4073300	4078740	by three screens each time. But sometimes that can lead you into a brick wall. So there are very
4078740	4084100	specific ways to kind of get through this game. The treasure bags, money, gold bars, silver bars,
4084100	4091860	diamond rings, and that all changes the points to it. A perfect score in this game is 114,000
4091860	4097060	points. That means you never get hit with a little rolling log or anything like that or fall
4097060	4103940	or your die or any of that stuff. So yeah, there is a way a specific way to run through this game
4103940	4110180	very fast. You have to use the underground tunnels to do it, of course. And this game was rereleased
4110180	4116900	a lot. This game was ported to a lot of different places in the 1980s. Because of course,
4117460	4121540	games back then were ported to a lot of things. So of course, most people know the Atari 2600
4122100	4129220	but it came out on Apple II, the Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, the MSX,
4129220	4135780	the Intellivision, and of course the place where I played this game mostly, which was,
4135780	4141060	you guessed it, the Commodore 64. So let me switch the scene here for those watching live
4141060	4148020	to the Commodore 64 version, which was a little noisier because the jumping kind of made a
4148020	4153540	different noise. And the footsteps all made noise. And of course, it used the SID chip
4153540	4160180	there for the vine noise to make this very impressive stereo effect. But otherwise,
4160180	4165220	it pretty much was the same game that you would see on the 2600. Let me turn down the volume a
4165220	4168900	bit because the footsteps running by are going to be really annoying because it's constantly
4168900	4176420	throughout this Commodore 64 version of the game. David Crane, who made this game, said that in 1979,
4176420	4183140	he kind of made technology to display a running man. And in 1982, he wanted to use it in a game.
4183140	4187460	So that's where Pitfall came from. He says, I sat down with a blank sheet of paper and drew
4187460	4192740	a stick figure in the center. I said, okay, I have a little running man, and let's put him on a path.
4192740	4197940	Two more lines on the paper. Where is the path? It's a jungle. Why is he running? Treasures.
4197940	4203460	And Pitfall was born. This entire process took about 10 minutes, about 1000 hours of programming
4203460	4210020	later, the game was complete. And yeah, I think, you know, many people remember this game as like
4210020	4216340	a really early platforming game that they played and it sold very, very well, which was important
4216340	4223140	for a few reasons because it was not an Atari developed game. It was developed by a third party,
4223140	4229380	one that was very attractive to newer developers because and programmers because they credited
4229460	4234660	people with the game. Later versions of this game actually called it David Crane's Pitfall. So it
4234660	4242660	was very popular. This game sold 1 million units in five months. It was more popular than ET,
4243300	4248420	to put it in perspective for 1982, which is pretty sick. That's a very low bar to hit, but okay. It
4248420	4255060	is. But when you consider Atari spent $21 million for the ET license, and a third party got this
4255060	4261780	one. Yeah, money well spent. Exactly. And people remember this game is one of the all time best.
4262980	4267060	The Arky Awards, which I've never heard of, but sure. Oh, it's because it was electronic games
4267060	4273140	magazine. Okay, it was a while ago. It got best adventure video game. Game Informer said this is
4273140	4280260	the 41st best game out of all time out of the top 100. But that was in 2001. So it was a while ago.
4280260	4285780	But in 2013, Entertainment Weekly said it was one of the 10 best Atari 2600 games. Okay,
4285780	4289620	I guess it's probably not a huge I mean, yeah, this is a hugely influential game.
4290180	4294900	And then of course sequels. I've talked about Pitfall to the Lost Caverns before.
4295540	4298980	It was a long time ago. So maybe you weren't listening to the show back when I did that.
4299700	4303620	But it's it's worth your time to check out because that was the first Atari 2600 game with a
4303620	4310820	soundtrack actually. And it was great on Commodore 64 as well. And they remade it into a game called
4310820	4317620	Super Pitfall for the Nintendo Entertainment System, which in my opinion was fucking garbage.
4317620	4323140	It's actually one of the worst NES games I've ever seen was Super Pitfall. So how dare they call it
4323140	4329060	a port of Pitfall to the Lost Caverns? Because it's terrible. They Loki they gave Pitfall Harry
4329060	4336500	a gun. And as cool as that sounds, it did not work. No, it did not. Anyway, later on, we got
4336500	4340660	Pitfall The Mayan Adventure for like Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. And they ported it
4340660	4347620	to a lot of places. Pitfall 3D Beyond the Jungle, where Bruce Campbell did Pitfall Harry Jr. You
4347620	4352100	know that that came out on the PlayStation. It was also out on the Game Boy Color. And then there was
4352100	4356980	another sequel called Pitfall The Lost Expedition. But let's be real, it by then the series it
4356980	4361300	evolved into something different. It wasn't really the same thing that we saw here. There
4361300	4367140	was a rerelease for iOS and Android. But it's not this game. It's a 3D endless runner and it came
4367140	4374020	out in 2012 when those were really huge. I didn't know this. David Crane did a Kickstarter for a
4374020	4379700	game called Jungle Venture, which was to be a spiritual successor to the original games.
4380340	4385380	He was trying to raise $900,000 to create Jungle Venture. Do you know how much he raised?
4386260	4395140	$31,000. So it was pretty bad. And on reflection, David Crane said, you know what? People thought
4395140	4399220	he was asking for too much. And everyone turned against him as soon as they saw the cost.
4401140	4406420	And it was a bad time. There's been too many Kickstarters of that price that have gone sour.
4406420	4416340	And I think it's just, yeah. Anyway, Pitfall also showed up on the CBS Saturday Supercade
4416340	4423300	with Pitfall Harry. Robert Wrigley voiced Harry. And Rhonda, the niece, was in the animated series
4423300	4429060	as well. She's in the sequel, as well as Quick Claw, the lion. So they were all in that. But
4429060	4434660	then Pitfall Harry got replaced by Kangaroo and Space Ace in later seasons. So it wasn't around
4434660	4442100	very long. Also interesting, an abbreviated version of Pitfall is in the game Gary Kitchen's
4442100	4448660	Game Maker, which was a Commodore 64, Apple II, and IBM PC released in 1985. That's kind of
4448660	4455060	interesting. And Pitfall is, of course, referenced in the movie Ready Player One as one of the only
4455060	4461380	2,600 games that still hasn't ended. And there were clones. When you have popular games, people
4461380	4467300	make clones. Trapfall for the TRS-80 and Cuthbert in the Jungle for the Dragon 32.
4468500	4471540	Do you remember this game, Logie? Pitfall? Did you play this?
4472100	4474020	Yes, I played it on the Atari 2600.
4474020	4475540	It's a good game, huh?
4476500	4478500	Yes, it was one of my favorites.
4478500	4479000	Yeah.
4479860	4480820	Certainly was an ET.
4481780	4486500	Yeah, for sure. Let's see. Shehulk in chat says, Pitfall is a great game.
4486500	4492180	Bit.Trip Runner is a great homage game to Pitfall. You know, I never thought about that,
4492180	4499540	but you're right. I mean, I don't know if you can say Pitfall invented the side scroller platformer,
4500260	4505060	but it certainly showed that they could be popular. Because again, this sold a million
4505060	4510580	copies, and we didn't have a game like this on the Atari 2600 yet. Some folks in chat are thinking
4510580	4514020	about what might a remake, you know, what if Jungle Venture had happened? What might a remake
4514020	4520180	of Pitfall look like now? Tiger Claw says, Imagine next gen Pitfall. Well, a lot of them went 3D.
4520180	4525860	I'm not sure it's, you know, as exciting as the original was, but it sure seems like a lot of you
4525860	4534100	would go run a game like this. So, yeah. Let's see. Bobby Blackwell says, My Pitfall experience
4534100	4539220	was on Intellivision. Yeah, there was a version of this on Intellivision. I believe they released
4539220	4545700	Pitfall on the Sega Master System as well. But if I remember correctly, that is a port of the
4545700	4552980	arcade game, which is Pitfall 2. So, it is not the original, original Pitfall. So, but there it is,
4552980	4558900	your classic game of the week, Pitfall, originally on the Atari 2600, but later out on a variety of
4559620	4566980	different systems. So, I hope you like that. Yeah. I wasn't sure what to pick tonight. So, I was,
4566980	4571620	well, I had asked somebody else to do it, but our schedules couldn't line up today to do it.
4571620	4575940	So, I was like, all right, last minute pick, I'll do it. So, sorry, Loki, I really need to let you
4575940	4582260	have a turn and pick something, but that's fine. Yeah, it's fine. We'll let you drive soon. What's
4582260	4586740	a game you want to do? Do you know? Oh, gosh, I don't know. All right, well, you probably
4586740	4593220	shouldn't ruin it anyway. All right. That was the classic game of the week. So, let's get back into
4593220	4598100	some rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines happening in the gaming world this week.
4598100	4605540	Loki. Yes, the Steam Deck is getting a delay. Well, the dock is. They're not putting out the
4605540	4611940	dock for your Steam Deck. So, you're just going to have to plug it into a normal USB device for now.
4613140	4617780	But yes, they'll be coming later. They said they didn't specifically target a new window,
4618340	4622500	but that they would be rolling out at some point.
4622500	4625860	We're working on improving the situation and we'll share more when we have it.
4630580	4635700	But things that we do have somewhat of a window for. It's going to be Super Nintendo World coming
4635700	4642500	to Universal Studios Hollywood. That is going to be coming early 2023. This was revealed in a tweet
4642500	4648900	that they put out. So, very exciting to see that coming nearby, because Japan's too far away from
4648900	4654340	me. Yeah, I'm excited. And it's not Orlando either, because usually all the cooking
4654340	4660820	park shit goes to Orlando first. So, sorry, but it's our turn to get something before Orlando.
4660820	4666660	So, I got Harry Potter World. It's fine, you know. So, you got Harry Potter World first,
4666660	4671380	then we get this first. Yeah. So, we get the Mario World. And it sounds like the ride is a
4671380	4675220	little different than Japan. It's still Mario Kart, but it sounds like it's like Bowser's
4675220	4678500	Castle or something instead. Like, it's different than what they have in Japan.
4678500	4682340	Probably just the environment or whatever. No, the ride's in Bowser's Castle.
4683380	4688660	Then maybe I'm mixing the Japan one up with something. Like, I think the theming is different
4688660	4692900	slightly between the two. I think maybe the track or whatever is going to ultimately be different.
4692900	4697700	So, well, yeah. Maybe that means the Orlando one will be different as well. Who knows?
4697700	4702740	They need a roller coaster in there. Yeah. All right. Chad is telling me it's
4702740	4705940	the same as Japan's. I thought it was a different theming. All right. Whatever.
4705940	4709300	Maybe because you were thinking, because the interactive ride's called Mario Kart
4709300	4713940	Bowser's Challenge. But that's what I think it's called in Japan too.
4713940	4721380	Okay. All right. But yeah. Let's road trip, Loki. Let's go. Let's go to the, I guess,
4721380	4727140	the broccoli farm and go. This isn't a broccoli farm. That's Disneyland.
4727540	4730820	This would be the asparagus farm. All right. Asparagus farm. Yeah.
4733940	4738340	But that'll be fun. I definitely want to go check this out when it opens. I wonder how crowded it
4738340	4744420	will be when it first kind of opens. Probably pretty early in the year. You know, it's probably
4744420	4749540	best to get in there before summer. And the nice thing is my job is super cool. And if I want to
4749540	4753780	just take like a Wednesday, Thursday in the middle of week off to go do it, I can do it. So that's
4753780	4758260	probably what I'll do. I'll go on a Wednesday. My worry is that like literally you're going to go
4758260	4763380	there and like spend an hour and you're like, okay, I've seen everything. Like, that's kind of
4763940	4769460	how I feel it's going to be. Probably. But I like the other rides at Universal Studios Hollywood.
4769460	4774420	The first time we ever went on the Mummy ride, which is different than Orlando. It's not an
4774420	4780260	outdoor coaster like Orlando is. The Mummy ride is an indoor black light ride. But we didn't know. So
4780260	4783700	I went with extra for for those of you that remember Hoard House and, you know, remember
4783700	4789860	extra has been on this show, too. I went for the first time to Universal Hollywood with extra. We
4789860	4793780	went on the Mummy ride and we didn't know what it was. We had no idea what we knew. It was a black
4793780	4798820	light ride and we heard it was a thrill ride. So for those of you that have been on it, it's have
4798820	4802900	you been on this ride? Loki, the Mummy ride? No, I haven't been there. I'm going to spoil it for
4802900	4806740	you, but with good reason. So when the ride starts, yeah, it's like a black light, right?
4806740	4810340	You're going from like room to room and it zips around and you're like, Oh, wow, this is pretty
4810340	4813940	cool. And it kind of like moves, you know, kind of like, Whoa, whoa, like, it's like, like the
4813940	4818020	people mover, you know, on crack or whatever. It's like, Whoa. And then you get to this point at the
4818020	4824740	end. And the, the big evil Pharaoh, I don't know those movies very well, comes on or whatever and
4824740	4830260	says, like, now I have possessed you or something and does whatever. And then you go backwards,
4830820	4836100	lightning fast through the entire thing you just went through, which I think they actually cleverly
4836100	4840340	put on an actually different track to keep things moving. It's not just forward and back. I think
4840340	4844980	you actually go backwards, like a different way or whatever. But it's it feels like you're going back
4844980	4851220	through the same thing. And you're going like 70 miles an hour backwards. Xfer and I had no idea
4851220	4860020	that this was about to happen. The pitch at which we screamed our heads off. I'm sure that like,
4860020	4865380	there were little kids on the ride that are like, Who are these two man screaming babies in the
4865380	4871620	front of this car right now? But we didn't know that like, we did not know that the ride went
4871620	4879540	backward at like 70 miles an hour. Check out one of those like 4k walkthroughs on. Yeah.
4880900	4886740	It's wild. And then you get back and then you're, you're back at start. And we're just like,
4886740	4889300	what the fuck just happened? What happened? Oh my God.
4890260	4891540	Like screaming.
4894900	4895540	That's funny.
4896900	4900980	All right. As Joanna Matt says, they made a mirror image of the ride to make it work. I think
4900980	4904740	defunct land did a thing on it. Yeah. I'm pretty sure you're just going back in reverse, like
4904740	4910900	mirror image, but it was really, really fun. And so now I love to ride that ride every time I go
4910900	4917300	to universal Hollywood. Cause I think it's great. And as much as the, the writer of the series
4917300	4922340	annoys me, I consider Harry Potter at this point to be a Hatsune Miku written series.
4922980	4928980	So I enjoy going to the wizarding world and drinking the butter beer and that ride is
4928980	4935540	really well done. The Hatsune Miku presents the wizarding world ride is, is great. I love that
4935540	4942900	ride. So you weren't talking to Mrs. I said, I don't like that turf who wrote the book. So as
4942980	4948260	far as I'm concerned, Hatsune Miku wrote, yeah, I buy into Hatsune Miku wrote it. So that's,
4948260	4954660	that's where I am with that. Hatsune Potter. Yes. And then I love that Simpsons ride is so
4954660	4958900	fucking cute. I want to see that. It looked awesome. That ride is fun. That used to be
4958900	4962900	the back to the future ride back in the day, but now it's really fun. So they have some,
4962900	4966100	they have some cute rides at the transformer rides. Really impressive too. Anyway,
4966100	4969300	I don't mean for this whole thing to be a fucking ad for universal studios, Hollywood,
4969300	4972260	but I would say there are more things to do there than just super Mario world.
4972260	4977460	And like you have to do the backlot tour. If you're going to go to universal use,
4977460	4981540	it takes like an hour to get through the backlot tour. Cause you're in line for 20 minutes.
4981540	4987620	The tour is like 25 minutes. It's not short. You go on this Tramra and then the tram has some
4987620	4991940	weird stuff built into it. Like there's like a King Kong tunnel, but it's super lame. They
4991940	4996580	need to get rid of it. Earthquake. And yeah, the earthquake's actually pretty cool. Although it's
4996580	5003060	very like 1970s movie, but it's cool. Well, it's 1990s cause like I remember when they first put
5003060	5008260	that in, like we went to it and did all that. Oh, that's cool. They had a fast and furious thing
5008260	5012900	last time I was there, which was okay. Yes. They had that too with the dancing cars.
5012900	5018900	No, they replaced the car scene with a whole like a tunnel. You go in and a movie plays and
5018900	5023780	all this stuff. They replaced the carpet. Yeah. Oh yeah. Cause the dancing car thing. I was like,
5024580	5029060	okay, cool. Yeah. No, there was like a car crash reenactment or something.
5029060	5035460	Oh yeah. And then they always have to do Jaws. They have Norman Bates come out and chase the car.
5035460	5040900	Yep. And it just depends what else is going on because like they used to have the Desperate
5040900	5046420	Housewives street was there and there was because they do shoot things there. The voice shoots at
5046420	5050340	Universal Hollywood, I think. And they would always talk about that. So anyway, sorry,
5050340	5053940	I don't mean to turn this into a theme park podcast, uh, dark diseases, whatever happened
5053940	5059380	to the explicit Disney podcast. I would so still do something like that, but like theme parks are,
5059380	5064820	I'm going to be explicit fucking expensive. So that's traveling around to the theme parks is
5064820	5071540	the challenge with that, to be honest. So anyway. All right. Um, let's move on. Let's travel around
5071540	5075540	the world and check out some release dates and things that will be out faster than we can get to
5075540	5081060	Universal Studios Hollywood. Not much to speak because of course, you know, it being previously
5081060	5088820	E3 week, but not quite E3 week. Uh, there's not a lot coming out. So, uh, let's see, we've got.
5088820	5093380	They'll probably be some today releases with, um, summer game Fest.
5093380	5097300	Yeah. Some digital stuff. Um, so we have Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic two,
5097300	5102820	the Sith Lords on Nintendo switch, uh, the cycle frontier on PC.
5103940	5110580	We have even if tempest on tend to switch tour de France, 22 on PC PlayStation four,
5110580	5117460	PlayStation five, X-Box one and X-Box series, demon Slayer, uh, Komitsu, no,
5118180	5126260	yeah. Bye. Uh, the Hinokami Chronicles on Nintendo switch, Mario strikers, battle league on
5126260	5133300	Nintendo switch, uh, metal max Zeno reborn on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four.
5134020	5140420	And last but not least the query on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, X-Box
5140420	5145620	one and X-Box series going over to Japan and checking out the releases there on the
5145620	5150260	Nintendo switch this week, we have demon Slayer, Kimetsu, no, yeah. Uh, you know,
5150260	5155380	come a couple of time comes out this week. Uh, that is in Japan, regular and limited edition,
5155380	5162420	a game called clap, exclamation exclamation with a K. So it's K L a P. And I was disappointed to
5162420	5166660	find out this game is not about clapping. Um, but it is, it looks like it's another dating
5166660	5170180	SIM to be quite, I don't know if it's based on anime or what, but apparently this is whole,
5170180	5175460	a whole like a, but it's, I think it's a female protagonist where you date men is what I believe
5175460	5182100	this one is. So, um, that's fun. Um, yeah, you do not get the clap as part of the game. I don't,
5182180	5190180	I don't know what K L a P stands for. Um, perhaps. Yeah. Anyway, um, moving on, what else do we have
5190180	5195140	in Japan this week? We have, Oh, Mario strikers battle league is a worldwide release of course.
5195140	5200340	So it is out in Japan this week as well. So, um, really that's about it for the switch
5200340	5208100	on the PlayStation five. Um, nothing. Oh no, the quarry actually is, would be this week.
5208100	5211300	So that game also gets a Japanese release this week, which is, um,
5211300	5215780	I can't imagine it's localized for Japan, but I will point out it's published by take two over
5215780	5221220	there instead of two K that's the same thing. Yeah. Which is why, why did they put it under
5221220	5226100	different labels though? That's weird. I don't know. Yeah, that's weird. Maybe they don't know
5226100	5235700	two K over there. All right. Anyway, let's move on. How about the UK? We've got spell force three
5235700	5244740	rebound. Um, that's coming on PlayStation four and X-Box series. We have Ikai on PlayStation
5244740	5252580	four and five and to switch metal max Xena reborn on PlayStation and the switch Mario
5252580	5261460	strikers battle league on Nintendo switch demon Slayer on Nintendo switch. Also getting the quarry
5261460	5270100	on PlayStation and X-Box as well. And that's it. There's a lot of people I know that are super
5270100	5275060	excited about that quarry game because, um, spiritual successor to until dawn,
5275780	5281060	give me a quarry rush of blood, please. Which is weird because until dawn, that whole,
5281060	5284820	what do they call that universe? There's other games that have already come out in that universe.
5285540	5289620	Um, really? Yeah. I can't God damn it. I can't remember the name. Somebody in chattel beat me
5289620	5294820	to it, but it's the whole, like, there's a whole universe where, and there's other games that have
5294820	5301140	come out in that, but they're, they have not really seemed to catch wind the way, um, until
5301140	5307300	dawn did. So this seems to be like the true, like spiritual successor to the game. There was a VR
5307300	5312340	game that they put out. What the hell was it called blood? No, no, a different one that,
5312420	5314740	that was more like until dawn with the choices and stuff.
5315700	5324260	Oh, um, it's going to bug me until I figure out what that game is called.
5326340	5330420	Butterfly. No, wait, no, that's not butterfly effect. Uh, that's a game mechanic.
5330420	5332820	Let's see. Don't know.
5337780	5340820	Now I need to look at like what super massive games did.
5340820	5345300	Was it house of ashes? Yes. House of ashes. I think was one of them
5345300	5351700	that they did the dark. They call it anthology. That's what I was thinking that there were other
5351700	5355460	house of ashes. It's dark pictures, anthology. That's, that's what I was trying to think of.
5356420	5360740	So there we go. Phew. That was going to bother me until I knew what it was. All right.
5362900	5366500	All right. Let's, uh, let's get into some more news, more bundles
5367460	5370260	games for great causes on the cheap, right? Loki.
5371140	5380340	Yes, we have the, um, the queer games bundle is going to be coming out on itch.io and is a
5380340	5388500	collection of 500 plus games that you can get for $60. So that's going to be benefiting. I guess
5389220	5394980	the money is going to the LG BTQ developers who may be 500 games. I don't think they're
5394980	5401700	donating it to anything else, but it's good to support them. Um, what else?
5401700	5405140	I want to see what games are in here. If there's anything I recognize.
5406820	5412420	Uh, well, and honestly, maybe the fact that you don't recognize something is part of the
5412420	5418580	reason why a bundle can really help bring visibility, um, to the games. So I think that's
5418580	5424260	great. Yeah. I'll check it out. Let's look through. Yeah. I want to see maybe, wait,
5424260	5427700	I just saw a Lincoln chat here. So let me check it out here. Cause I actually didn't know about
5427700	5434340	this fundraiser. Um, and I'm curious if I recognize anything here. Um, I swear somebody
5434340	5442260	linked this Parmesan game on Twitter. Um, the Parmesan, an eight bit story about a non-binary
5442260	5445220	person being bullied for being who they are. I'm almost positive. Somebody I know who's
5445220	5450340	non-binary was talking about that game. Um, I'm going to tell you right now, I have my
5450340	5456500	winner of the bundle here. Crime frog. Crime frog? That sounds fun.
5456500	5463220	Opposite of frog detective. You're a frog that commits crimes. Or there's also wrapped your
5463220	5471300	boyfriend. Uh, what's, oh, I like this. Look at this. There's a game called X purrs. Oh no,
5471300	5476820	that's the, is that the name of the game? Yeah. X purrs online X. Chat with your online cat
5476820	5483060	friends. That's perfect. Perfect. Yeah. I'll pick up this bundle for sure.
5484180	5487220	Yes. There's, there's lots of interesting things in here.
5487220	5491060	Awesome. Oh no. As you went home, Matt sent the wrong link.
5492820	5498100	Oh, he sent me the 2021 bundle. Dick. No, I'm just kidding. It's fine. He was getting me all
5498100	5504100	excited about these games. All right. That's all right. Let me see if I get, let me see what I
5504100	5507220	noticed in the 2022, but all right. Well, you know what? It doesn't take away from anything
5507220	5514740	I said about those other games. Um. Crime frog. That's really what I don't.
5514740	5518980	Yeah. I don't wreck it. Actually. I do notice there are a lot of games from the 2021 bundle
5518980	5524340	that are here too. What's this sock puppet song and dance. Oh, it's songs and step charts for
5524340	5530980	step mania. That's fun. That's a cute add on. Duck. Yeah. Sock puppets, song and dance. There's
5530980	5536980	something called duck, duck swap. Are you a duck or a duck or a duck? I like that. A game called
5536980	5541540	three lesbians in a Barrow. You know exactly what you're going to get with that. I love it.
5543700	5547540	All right. I'll check this out. Sorry. I, I know me scrolling through a list does not make for the
5547540	5552660	most exciting radio, but I was like genuinely curious. What was, uh, in this Virginia
5552660	5558820	Wolfenstein, but with two O's. See, that's funny. Well, here's another one. Here we go.
5559780	5565220	Lay lay perfect crime. It is a cat based stealth game set in a museum.
5566660	5572740	And there's another cat game here called screams and Queens, but it's a tabletop RPG,
5572740	5578100	but it stars cat pageant Queens at a spooky school. I mean, I like the amount of cat games
5578100	5584500	in the cat games, but gays love cats. Like, and I'm, I'm saying that with firsthand experience,
5584500	5592020	um, here, here's the thing. People try to get me to play D and D and I'm always like, yeah,
5592020	5595700	D and D is cool, but like, I don't know. I'm kind of, but like, if you invite me over,
5595700	5599940	like don't invite me over to play D and D invite me over to play cat pageant, Queens,
5599940	5603220	tabletop RPG, and then I'll be like, Oh, yeah, I'm in. Tell me more
5603220	5611380	people, people. All right. Uh, thanks for the heads up about the bundle though. Sounds great.
5611380	5617380	Uh, what else do we have? Okay. All right. And then, uh, we also have
5618580	5626420	a, uh, there's a, tell me why is free to download now on Xbox and PC and celebration of
5626420	5633460	pride month. So you can get that via the Microsoft store or steam. So that's pretty cool.
5634820	5641380	Also Xbox publishing is going to be donating $25,000 to each of the transgender law center
5641380	5646500	and trends lifeline. Awesome. And that's good. That's a good, I haven't played through the
5646500	5650500	entire series, but, um, I really liked the first episode and I just need to finish it,
5650500	5654260	but you know, my attention span won't let me do those types of things. So yeah, check it out.
5655060	5664260	Yeah. And then, uh, we've got news that, uh, Junichi Masuda is leaving the Pokemon company.
5664980	5669460	Um, or I'm sorry, leaving game freak for a role at the Pokemon company.
5670980	5674980	So he says, I've served as the director of the Pokemon video game series, starting with
5674980	5681300	Pokemon Ruby version, Pokemon Sapphire version up until Pokemon X and Y, um, and was involved
5681300	5685940	in the development of many video games, including Pokemon go. I would like to express my heartfelt
5685940	5691140	thanks to all the Pokemon fans going forward. I hope to transcend the batteries of video games
5691140	5697220	by trying to offer greater surprises, fun, and excitement to people all over the world while
5697220	5702740	doing my utmost to connect people, expand the circle of play and help bring about a richer
5702740	5709300	world for us to share. I appreciate your continued support in my new role. And, uh, what is that new
5709300	5716500	role? He's going to be, let's see. I don't know. It's going to be doing something.
5717460	5721220	Well, if he's moving to the general Pokemon company as opposed to just game freak,
5721220	5726100	you imagine that he's on these Pokemon projects that aren't just the video games because, you
5726100	5731620	know, keep in mind, Pokemon is a fucking brand, right? It's the anime, it's the stuffed toys,
5731620	5737620	it's the movies, it's, it's everything. Right. And to hear him talk about new experiences is that
5737620	5742020	maybe it is something beyond just a game as we think about, I don't know, my brain kind of goes
5742020	5747060	to AR type of experiences. Cause I feel AR because it's like, you hear Niantic talking a lot about
5747060	5751060	that too. Not that I'm saying that necessarily like, you know, who will Pokemon go already?
5751860	5757140	He's going to be the chief creative fellow. So, okay. So he's responsible for coming up
5757140	5760900	with new ideas for where Pokemon is going next. And I think that's very evident in what he's
5760900	5765860	saying in his statement too, is that he wants to go beyond just a video game. He wants to do with
5765860	5770020	the Katamari Damacy guy did and make a playground. That's what he wants to make a Pikachu.
5770020	5773540	Yeah, but he came back to games. There's only so many playgrounds you can do before you get
5773540	5777860	bored of that. That's like, that's a hobby thing. And then you go back to what you know.
5777860	5782260	Yeah. But I think that, I think that's what it is. This is about kind of like doing things other
5782260	5787860	than just the game, but like realizing a fun thing in other ways. And it's probably just playing with
5787860	5794980	new technology to see where that might be. Or he's, or they're reviving Pokemon sleep
5795620	5800180	and maybe he's, he's going on that. Who knows? It's worth a shot.
5800180	5806580	He's going on sleep. I'm taking a sleep from now until, eh, in the future.
5806580	5808500	No, Pokemon sleep. Remember?
5809220	5812340	Yeah, exactly. I understand that. But in order to test Pokemon sleep, you have to sleep.
5812340	5814420	Ah, you have to nap a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5814420	5814920	Yeah.
5815460	5819380	SSG100Matt says, Pokemon theme park in North America, please.
5819380	5824660	Honestly, honestly, would any of us be sad if that's what he's doing?
5825620	5828980	No, I don't think any of us would be sad. A Pokemon theme park? Sign me the fuck up.
5830420	5831780	Don't they already have those in Japan?
5832740	5837220	Well, I think so. They have like Pokemon centers for sure too. That's just basically the store.
5838740	5842660	They've got to have a whole theme park. I'm surprised the Nintendo partnership with
5842660	5846420	Universal doesn't turn into that. But I think that they're expanding on that.
5846420	5849220	So like Nintendo Land, what they have right now is just kind of...
5849220	5853220	To correct myself, technically, Nintendo doesn't own Pokemon. The Pokemon company
5853220	5855140	owns Pokemon, right? So it gets into those nuances.
5855140	5855700	I get that.
5855700	5856340	Right. Yeah, yeah.
5856340	5859380	But like, I think, though, that they were supposed to be expanding to
5859380	5862100	like a Donkey Kong country thing.
5862100	5862740	Yeah.
5862740	5867060	Yeah. Well, yeah. So I don't know. We'll see.
5868500	5873940	I would love a Pokemon theme park. I would even travel to like North Dakota for a Pokemon theme
5873940	5878180	park or like a state that's like not really on my must go. Montana? Let's fucking go.
5879460	5882500	Like, I'll go to a place that's not usually at the top of my travel list.
5882500	5884580	They can have Pokemon Snap IRL.
5885940	5888500	Now you're fucking talking. Absolutely.
5889060	5890900	That's the game you need. Yeah.
5890900	5897060	All right. Before we get to the listener roundtable, let's talk about Super Bomberman
5897060	5904100	R and how they are ending the online service. Specifically, it's Super Bomberman R Online,
5905140	5911700	which I believe is a separate release than the Super Bomberman R that originally came out
5911700	5917620	for Nintendo Switch. They did a Super Bomberman R Online in May of 2021.
5918180	5921460	So it hasn't even been a year and the plug's getting pulled.
5921460	5924100	I'm sorry. It has been one year. Excuse me. One year.
5925300	5930100	So Dr. Seuss says, yeah, it's the free to play one.
5931700	5934820	Why is Konami closing this? This is Konami.
5935460	5939620	But on the record, they've said the series is moving forward with new projects
5940340	5945860	and they want to show off something soon and says, thanks for the support of the series.
5946740	5950660	However, go to hell. We're pulling the plug. No, they didn't say that second part,
5950660	5953780	but that's what it feels like to fans of Super Bomberman R Online.
5953780	5956580	But here's my question. How many people were actually still playing that game?
5958660	5961700	And I'm not talking about the original Super Bomberman R.
5961700	5964260	How many people were actually playing that online game?
5964260	5968660	Which wasn't that a Stadia thing too? I swear that was a thing they announced
5968660	5971140	for Stadia right around that time too. It may have been.
5973220	5976740	I'm Googling it right now. Yes, it is. It was a Stadia thing.
5976740	5981220	Cause I think Stadia was really hyping that up when it originally came out on that as well. So
5983140	5989220	RIP and peace. That's it for the news that we have scheduled tonight.
5989780	5993380	Now we'd like to invite you guys to participate with the show. If you'd like to call us
5994340	6000180	in our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord, that's vognetwork.com slash discord.
6000740	6004020	And in the green room is the place you can go to get in on the show.
6004020	6008420	You can send us an email if you like. Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6008420	6012180	I don't think we have any emails tonight. Sad face, but maybe next week we will get some.
6012740	6018020	Thank you. Orange Rite is saying what I thought was the case. It started as a Stadia exclusive
6018020	6020340	and it went to other consoles eventually.
6020340	6023380	The Stadia still has a Pac-Man game that's exclusive, don't they?
6023380	6027860	But I thought Bomberman wasn't that on, it wasn't the exclusive though, wasn't it
6027860	6030420	also on the Switch? I thought that was a Switch launch title.
6030420	6035780	It was eventually, but no, you're, you're, there was a Super Bomberman R on the Switch.
6035780	6042820	There was that. This is a online free to play thing. That's basically the same fucking thing.
6043620	6047220	It's, it's Bomberman, Loki. You know how much that game's evolved over the years?
6047860	6054500	Not that much. So that Bomberman online specific one was Stadia first. And then
6054500	6058980	when Stadia kind of didn't have enough players, uh, they released it to other places too.
6060500	6064260	All right. We do have somebody waiting in the green room. It's a, it's a frequent call.
6064260	6067220	It's a serial caller to OLR, but we love to hear from this caller.
6067220	6068740	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
6071140	6074180	And they, they popped right back to the green room. Awesome. Let's try again.
6074180	6076900	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
6078740	6081940	Hello there, good friend. Hi, how are you?
6082820	6085300	No, I'm fine. How about you?
6085300	6088180	Good. It's the one and only Rama everybody. How are you?
6089060	6090260	Good. I'm good.
6091060	6092180	What's on your mind tonight?
6093140	6098580	Oh, oh, Robinson Roberts. You and I need to have a little talk young man.
6098580	6099540	Don't you call me by my full name.
6100420	6102580	I just did. And there's a reason why I did.
6102580	6106980	Oh, why is that? What did I do? Oh, is this last week? Oh, I can't wait.
6108100	6111220	Yeah. I was gone for the whole weekend. You know,
6111220	6113060	Memorial day off having a good time.
6113060	6115540	Anime convention. How dare you?
6115540	6117060	No, no, no.
6117060	6119300	I thought it was, I thought there was a big anime con last week.
6119860	6123300	There's like, there was like three to four major anime conventions.
6125540	6130500	I, I spent it with a friend, but I have to come back into discord, you know, after
6130500	6137220	work and all of that. And I was told to listen to last week's show and a DDR challenge.
6138580	6140020	That's right. That's right.
6141060	6145940	Why? Why are called into the show last week and basically was like, Hey, Rama, you got served.
6147540	6150100	And is it now, is it on it's on?
6151700	6152340	No.
6152340	6156020	Okay. What's tell me, tell me how you reacted to hearing that whole thing last week.
6156900	6163060	It's just a muse because I was talking about throwing together DDR for us, older folk,
6163060	6167220	like some of the more of the classic songs from DDR. That's no longer there.
6167220	6171940	That today's generation had no idea. I've heard of like, have you ever been mellow?
6171940	6176260	You know, some of the great suffered through keep on moving. I don't think you have,
6176260	6180500	or, and I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry. That song is fine.
6181060	6185140	Wow. I'm definitely getting old. I'm sorry. Let them move was the song I meant to say.
6185220	6186500	Have you ever suffered through?
6189220	6191540	Have you ever suffered to let them move? I don't think you have.
6194020	6198580	Yeah, I, I I've suffered. I know you have. I'm just saying these, these young kids today,
6199940	6206340	they don't know, but the main reason why I am not accepting why our challenge is because
6209140	6214260	years ago I couldn't even pass max 300 on basic. What makes them think that I could do it now?
6216100	6220660	Because you're good enough. You're strong enough and doggone it. People like you.
6222260	6229540	Just true. But scientific fact knows that my endurance can't make me do it because if I do it,
6229540	6236820	you're going to need to have nine one one on speed dial and oxygen tank and a cart nearby. Okay.
6236820	6241540	Cause you, I am going to either collapse halfway through the step chart or you're going to drag me
6241540	6246740	off. Here's the thing. And I'm going to say this to YYRS credit actually, although yes,
6246740	6253300	this is a very lofty challenge. There's a lofty goal to me. I really put this on the same level
6253300	6261700	as I'm going to train to run a marathon, not walk a marathon, run a marathon that is in my, like,
6262260	6267380	that is kind of literally what the ask is here on the physical level. I mean, you know,
6267380	6271220	some would argue the ins and outs of it, but I would say it's, it's very similar to
6271220	6275380	basically saying, Hey, Rama, I want you to train to run a marathon, which is,
6275380	6279540	it's a very lofty goal, but that it's going to take some work. It takes a bit of training.
6279540	6283620	You do have to build up your stamina and so forth. I do. I do applaud what, of course I
6283620	6288820	love what we are. I love they calls it a show and so forth. And I do applaud his effort behind that,
6288820	6293300	you know, and trying to get people to us old assholes to get more physically active.
6293300	6298580	And yes, he's a good example of you don't, you can be 40 and still do this shit. And I think
6298580	6304820	probably he's sick of hearing you and me say, no, we can't. No, we can't. He's sitting here going,
6304820	6308660	yes, you fucking can shut up, baby. I'm, I'm putting words in his mouth, but essentially
6308660	6313860	that's what he's saying. So I, on that level, I completely respect that. Like, you know,
6313860	6319220	you got to work for it and get, but it's just, you know, do we have the time to do that now?
6319220	6326900	Now, Rama, I think for me and where I'm at, I'm a little more apt to try this challenge because
6327540	6332980	I've already, thanks to things that happened to me personally, six months ago, have been making
6332980	6337540	diet changes and weight changes. And, you know, I've talked about how I've lost 50 pounds over
6337540	6341780	the last nine months, which is a huge life accomplishment, right? But that means that
6341780	6346420	my body's already, and I can see it in the heart meter. When I walk, it used to be that my heart
6346420	6351540	rate was really high. Now, my heart rate when I'm like walking is like not going up very much
6351540	6356420	at all, which is actually showing me, I probably need to get more physical activity. My only problem
6356420	6361140	is I don't really have a DDR machine near me anymore. I mean, I'm hoping that the Roseville
6361140	6364260	round one opens, but even then you're talking about a machine that's gonna be like 30 minutes
6364260	6370100	away from me. It's on the other, other side of Sacramento, literally. Well, I totally hear you
6370100	6376420	on that. Now where I work, which is like 10 blocks from Times Square, there's a Dave and
6376420	6382020	Busters right there. I can go there. Now the new one in Brooklyn, also that one is on my way home.
6382020	6389380	I actually said to a friend of mine, when we went to go play, we should do this every Friday night,
6389380	6396020	you know, because personally, when I went with that Dave and Busters with all five of my power
6396020	6402420	cards and had them put together, I think I have total of over a hundred tickets and 180 chips
6403060	6407540	all together. So I'm like, all they're doing is collecting dust. So I will sit and I will do this.
6407540	6414900	I will do three runs and then go home. Add me some water, have me some tea. And if I did some
6414900	6418340	really good, I'll go to the bar, have me a rum and Coke and be like, dammit, I deserve this.
6419620	6424420	Now I hear you about the Dave and Busters, about the round one being a half hour away.
6424420	6428260	It would be one thing if you were driving back and forth and it's long the way.
6428260	6432340	And I just, I could also go to Loki's house to use a DDR machine.
6434740	6436020	Loki's even further away.
6438260	6442580	You know, Rob, you know, step mania, right?
6442580	6443080	Yeah.
6443940	6445940	Do you have DDR pads in your house?
6445940	6446500	Not anymore.
6448180	6449540	Do you see where I'm going with this?
6449540	6452660	Yeah, I could. I could. Yeah. Maybe.
6452660	6461220	Why not? Yeah. I'm just saying between me and your darling husband, we probably have enough
6461220	6466500	PC parts to build together a simple machine with all the step charts. And you probably know
6466500	6470260	somebody that you could borrow a hard pad from, plug it in and roll with it.
6470260	6476180	Hubby and I have birthdays coming up and we're looking at, get this, this is how gay we are,
6477140	6481140	matching PCs. We're going to get matching PCs. We're just, because we're at that,
6481140	6485140	we're also at that age drama where we're just like, just pay the other people to build the
6485140	6492660	PCs and send them to us in a box. No, that's far from a gay thing to do.
6492660	6498500	That's a gaming thing to do. I actually know couples who had their gaming machines right
6498500	6504420	next to each other. I'm the type of person where no move your rig further away. I need all this
6504420	6510340	space, but you know, I think that's wonderful. So ironically, this machine here could be a step
6510340	6514820	mania machine if I really want it to be. If you're getting, I'm just saying,
6514820	6521060	if you're getting a brand new PCs across the board, you can move OLR studio on software to
6521060	6527380	the new PC retrofit, the old machine with the DDR pad, dark tip. So you probably has all of
6527380	6532180	the step charts. He's probably chilling in your backyard, you know, in the trench coat, opening
6532180	6537620	it up. Like I got all the mixes right here. What you need. I just also realized I literally have
6537620	6543540	a Mac mini that now does nothing. If we want to take all our mobile again at some point,
6543540	6548100	I guess it's there. But yeah, now I have, I have a Mac mini paperweight at this point. So there's
6548100	6557940	also that. Yeah, you know that too. Well, right there, you know, I say, why not? It's worth
6557940	6562900	thinking about because then I think about, Oh, but this room is upstairs. It might make a lot
6562900	6567060	of noise, but then I'm like, Oh, wait a minute. The downstairs neighbor is me. Cause we live,
6567060	6570980	we live in a townhouse where we have like our living areas downstairs and upstairs is the
6570980	6578900	bedrooms. So yeah, better. And I mean like, you might as well just take it a step further,
6578900	6583540	not just put step many on there. See if you can emulate a guitar freaks and beat mania and throw
6583540	6588500	it on there. Why not? You know, you got me thinking, I'm going to say that you've got me
6588500	6598740	thinking. All I did was have a, I just got a micro ITX board and a Ryzen, I think it was a
6598740	6607380	Ryzen three with an APU. Um, and then just like maybe four gigs of Ram. It's like, you don't
6607380	6615460	really need anything. And then just an SSD, you know, uh, I, so it's like, it's literally, it's
6615460	6622820	all in just like a tiny board and that's it. Hmm. Yeah. One drive the boot, the OS and other drive
6622820	6628500	with all this, with all the mixes and the step. All right. You got me, you got me. We'll see.
6629300	6635700	I mean, Rob, if you play this right, the only money you'll be spending is getting, um, hard
6635700	6640740	pads. That's it. Yeah, no, that's right. Cause it's something I could hook up on USB or something.
6640740	6645700	Yeah, for sure. All right. Y'all let me think. I will neither confirm nor deny,
6645700	6650020	but I'm thinking. You just have to drop a few thousand dollars to get an SMX machine
6650020	6655380	and then you're all good. I will say every time, you know, cause I'm friends with Kyle
6655380	6660100	on Facebook cause I think probably a lot of long time music game people are every time
6662100	6667460	he posts a song list update, I'm like, Jesus, this game. And that's a good, that's a good Jesus,
6667460	6672100	this game this week, man, it's, it's all been electric, electric call boy, man.
6672980	6677860	Like that. And he fucking got desire, uh, which is now he's, you know, one of his,
6677860	6682100	a new desire song, like, so like Sugaru from the old school DDR days,
6682100	6685780	like there's a new one of those in the game now. And I'm like, Jesus, this game.
6687780	6691460	So Bobby does say, make sure it's on the bottom floor of your house. So you don't shake the
6691460	6696020	ceiling and they're in is kind of the problem. Cause the bottom is already kind of spoken for us.
6696020	6701380	I don't know. Cause the bottom is also the kitchen though, but we'll see. Never say never. I'm just,
6701380	6706980	I'm not sure yet. Okay. And when you do go through all of this, make sure you get yourself a nice
6706980	6712900	pair of Skechers. Well, that's not a problem. I already buy it's like everything I wear is
6712900	6719140	Skechers are all though. So that part's easy. There you go. All right. Um, so challenge
6719140	6727620	officially declined, but possibly me accepting some form of the challenge. We'll see DDR club
6727620	6733620	where we play every weekend and trade off what we've been doing. Sure. You know? Yeah. I wish
6733620	6736900	there was a step mania machine near here. Cause then we could do the whole app thing. And then,
6736900	6742100	cause they got a, it's just, it's built smarter. I think than the only one I know of is in Rocklin
6742900	6747380	and that's at the strike. They have went the bowling alley there. Yeah. The strike. Oh,
6747380	6752020	well that's like 45 minutes from me, but at least it's like, I haven't played it a long time,
6752020	6757460	but they had it there last time I was there, which was free COVID. So I need to go out there
6757460	6762500	some weekday when the kids aren't there. It was pretty dead when we went out there,
6762500	6767700	but even on the weekend. All right. Interesting. DT just came up with something,
6767700	6772820	a weekly set list or something. That's not full of heavy charts. You know, he may want to join in.
6773460	6779860	All right. We'll see our club DDR club. All right. It's it's a cute idea. I'm I'm into it.
6779860	6784340	We'll see. We'll see when I get there. When I get the rig, we'll sell, see who's on board for a
6784340	6792980	DDR club. Yeah. All right. Anything else on your mind tonight? Rama? That's it. But check your
6792980	6798980	phone in the next five minutes. I'm sending you something. Okay. I will. All right. Thanks in
6798980	6804340	advance. Whatever it is. All right. I think, unless you're going to like, okay, good. I'm
6804340	6807540	like, it's something I'm gonna like. Right. Okay. Okay. All right. Oh, always. It's good to hear
6807540	6813300	from you. Rama, uh, anime jam session on Tuesday. Go hear about the 500 anime conventions that
6813300	6818500	happen nationwide this weekend. Most definitely. Oh yeah. And, uh, dragon slay conventional. Yeah,
6818500	6821940	but it's an action. It's a fighting game. It's actually pretty good. I have it. Oh,
6821940	6826100	okay. Good to know. All right. Take care of my friend. All right. Take care of y'all. Bye.
6826100	6830900	All right. Always good to hear from Rama. Uh, we can probably squeeze in another call
6830900	6835300	if anyone wants to call in, or if you have anything you would like to ask us about in chat
6835300	6839620	over at twitch.tv slash vogue network, you might want to get that out there before I decide I'm
6839620	6846100	done waiting. Um, Loki, any last minute stories you want to get into? Um, no, just, uh, well,
6846100	6851860	Fortnite ended its second season. So now they're on season three. Oh, was that the big event or
6851860	6858180	chapter three? Yeah. And now they have like their chapter three is vibing, which I don't understand
6858180	6864260	what the gameplay is there, but they have like Indiana Jones and there's lots of dancing and
6864260	6869780	these like ball things that you can write in just in the name and you can ride wolves. Honestly,
6869780	6874500	I think it's that they're trying to get people to go to Fortnite just to vibe and not necessarily
6874500	6879300	even play a game. That's it's, it's trying to expand on the social elements. Like, and I,
6879300	6884100	I literally know nothing besides what you just said. I'm almost like, just based on,
6884100	6888740	we've heard that like Fortnite is trying to expand into more of like a pop culture type of thing,
6888740	6892900	uh, thinking about the Ariana Grande concert and the multiple concerts that have been in there.
6892900	6897060	This, it probably is just to get people in there to not actually play a game and just vibe.
6898420	6901540	Don't play our game. They should have called it cool vibes only
6901540	6906420	or chill vibes only. I don't know. Chill vibes only.
6908820	6914420	Is that it? That's it. That's it. All right. Well, that's it for calls. That's it from
6914420	6918660	chat. So that's it for the show. Oh wait. I have to see what this is that I got texted.
6922820	6923700	Oh, this is cute.
6926180	6930900	Interesting. Okay. Wouldn't you like to know? All right.
6932260	6934900	I'll say it's a book. He sent me a picture of a book. I was like,
6934900	6940740	I didn't even know that was a book. All right. Um, let's see. I do want to read the Fred Reggie
6940740	6945220	fees and may book though. I cause that, that would have come out by now. Right. Cause I know
6945220	6948500	he's been out promoting it. I think so. He's been promoting it. Yeah. Check it out. Yeah.
6949060	6952980	All right. Um, that is going to do it for another episode of orange. I'll show you.
6952980	6955460	Thank you so much for downloading our show and checking us out. Uh,
6955460	6959620	we appreciate you tuning in. Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, uh,
6959700	6963460	tell a friend or two or five about the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where
6963460	6968100	every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here, uh, to diversify the opinions that we're
6968100	6972420	putting out on air. A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is,
6972420	6978180	you picked up the show is a great place to do that. Um, that's it. We go around and get the
6978180	6984100	final thoughts now and wrap it all up. Uh, I can't believe it's 20 years this month that we've been
6984100	6989140	doing OLR. Wowee. Wow. Well, we hope to see you back here on the 26th when we officially
6989140	6993060	acknowledge 20 years on the air, dark soccer should be back next week. We'll hear about her
6993060	6999140	adventures across country. Uh, let's get to our last, last final thoughts. Loki, your final
6999140	7006900	thoughts tonight. So my final thought is that I've got, um, so my next S and P that I'm starting
7006900	7012500	in here pretty soon. So it's on a, with a new group of people. Um, I'm doing a very awesome
7012500	7019460	theme. The already kind of a bit of a spoiler for myself. Um, it's going to be mega man themed.
7019460	7022980	So building stuff in Minecraft and mega man, but here's the best part though.
7024980	7032580	I'm creating eight brand new robot masters, all based on Minecraft stuff. And each one of them
7032580	7038500	has their own unique soundtrack for this stage. And I have five of the songs already. They're so
7038500	7046020	awesome. They're so awesome. Some of the best chiptune music ever. So stay tuned for that.
7046660	7054020	All right. Um, let's see. My final thought is, um, I don't know. I gotta, I gotta play more. I
7054020	7059220	gotta catch up with my backlog. I gotta, I kinda want to rearrange this room as well. I want to
7059220	7065460	do that and, uh, maybe move a TV up here for some of my consoles. I don't know. I'm thinking the
7065460	7070020	gears are turning. It's a dangerous thing. All right. Uh, that's going to do it for another
7070020	7074020	episode of orange laundry. Have a wonderful night, everybody. We'll see you next week.
7074020	7077540	Dark soccer will be here and we're going to have what summer game Fest to talk about.
7077540	7081540	We're going to have the Microsoft event is Sunday morning to talk about there. There's going to be
7081540	7086740	some big shit this week. So, uh, it's going to be exciting. So we'll see you next week for an
7086740	7092500	exciting episode of orange launch radio. See you next time. Good night. You've been listening to
