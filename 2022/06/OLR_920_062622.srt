00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,240
20 years ago, the news reported on a scary arcade game that featured booty booty booty

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,120
bass music. A few songs on which featured backgrounds with animations showing syringes

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,020
and pills, including a sexy nurse, but also the word medicine overlaid multiple times.

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,640
The news was negative. Geeks were outraged. 20 years later, most of the world has been

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,680
stuck with syringes multiple times, some also taking a pill in addition. The irony hurts.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,600
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to continue reminiscing

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,160
and bring you gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:54,200
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back once again and again and

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,460
again to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:09,360
live once again for tonight, June the 26th of 2022, episode number 920 of our show. And

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,500
as you might've heard the week that we have turned 20 years old as a show, a show that

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:24,980
dated back to our very first episode, June 23rd of 2002, when as Jason referenced there

13
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,500
in the intro, we were talking about controversy in the Dance Dance Revolution scene from,

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,140
oh my gosh, syringes and pills being shown in a background video. Who could imagine it?

15
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,460
And here we are 20 years later and syringes and pills, no big deal. That's commonplace

16
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,140
during the pandemic. By we, I mean, of course, myself, Rob Roberts joined as always by my

17
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,540
co-hosts. Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,180
Hey, what's up? I'm wearing the shirt.

19
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,780
Or as you've been known to say on the show for a very long time, what's up bitches?

20
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,420
What's up bitches?

21
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,740
You kind of made that, you kind of made that little motion tonight. What's up bitches?

22
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,020
With your OL army shirt, which I love.

23
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,300
I think I got this maybe after our third year.

24
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,180
Yeah, you've had it a while.

25
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,820
Kristen and I went to a trip to San Francisco and we had shirts made.

26
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,660
I love it.

27
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,900
I'll show you the back of it.

28
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,540
And on the back for those on the podcast feed, it says Dark Sakura with the number zero on the back.

29
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,020
Yep.

30
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,860
What number would I be on the team? If you're zero, which one am I?

31
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,900
0.69.

32
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,940
0.69, I'll take it. And then of course, of course, I have to ask the one and only

33
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,820
tech master, Loki.

34
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,220
Which number he would be. Hi, Loki.

35
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,500
I don't know.

36
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,740
Loki would be R.

37
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,940
The number R.

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,740
How about I would say 20.

39
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,380
Do you know why I would say 20?

40
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,420
Because that was the episode number when Dark Sakura and I were like, you know what?

41
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,020
Loki's been here every single week.

42
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,540
We're just retconning him as a full host for the whole thing.

43
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,900
So that was that was episode 20 because, you know, OK, so I'm going to go back.

44
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,220
Let's go back to the back down memory lane, because we're going to be doing that a little bit tonight as we look back on 20 years of the show.

45
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:31,420
Is that way back on the very first episode of OLR, which, by the way, for those of you that listen here at VOG Network, because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, Twitch.TV slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

46
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,020
Bobby wasn't on tonight, but I'll come back to that in a minute.

47
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:47,940
But anyway, we said a long time ago on this show, originally it was just Dark Sakura and I were going to start this show because we were on another show that was on for a long time, over 10 years, called Undersedation Live.

48
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,540
Dark Sakura was a guest host, but it was kind of like Loki.

49
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,700
She was there like all the time.

50
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,540
So.

51
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,540
Going in for for Jessica.

52
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,300
Yeah, a lot.

53
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:56,740
Yeah.

54
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,220
Yeah.

55
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:57,700
Yeah.

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,260
So so anyway, it was originally Dark Sakura and I.

57
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:14,700
But then the original vision of Orange Lounge Radio, and I've said this a lot, a lot, is that we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at the arcade, and then we would go from the arcade to the little cafe that was in front of Rose Hill Golf Land.

58
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:23,700
And we would eat mozzarella sticks to just put back those calories we just lost playing DDR and talk a little smack about video games, but in a fun way, because we love video games.

59
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:31,340
And the original episodes of OLR, we're trying to kind of like invoke that same thing where we would have everybody over at the house.

60
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,780
We invited like a lot of DDR people over it.

61
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:51,380
Like if you go back and listen to the first episode of Orange Lounge Radio, which you can do at VOG Network, because last year for the 19th anniversary, we did a special show where we all listened and reacted to episode one, which is which and I think we all kind of walked away going, that wasn't as bad as we thought it would be.

62
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,380
So that was fun.

63
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,020
So that is in the archives over at VOG Network for subscribers.

64
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,020
So what were you gonna say, Jayden?

65
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,940
I said, no, it was a it was pretty decent, actually.

66
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,180
It wasn't as bad as cringe as I expected it to be.

67
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,940
It wasn't.

68
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,700
It really wasn't.

69
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,900
And first off, because, you know, we do like to say we're the show where every gamer has a voice.

70
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,300
I know the situation with the pandemic.

71
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,340
We're doing this virtually now.

72
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,180
And it's just kind of now we've been used to doing it this way for so long.

73
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,900
We kind of don't really get together in the same room anymore.

74
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:31,540
But I'm so thankful that all of you in chat are here to share these weeks with us, whether you're

75
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,300
here every single week, like Dark Tetsuya, I'm just going to I'm going to name names.

76
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,820
Dark Tetsuya has been here pretty much every single week since the very first episode.

77
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,460
He may have missed an episode here or there, but so is Dark Sakura.

78
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,100
So is Loki.

79
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,340
So so have I.

80
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,700
There was there were a couple of shows I wasn't even at.

81
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,780
So like, you know, we all missed a show here and there.

82
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,980
Dark Tetsuya has been there since the very beginning as well.

83
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,980
In our chat room.

84
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,700
So whether you're Dark Tetsuya or anybody else, if you're just I'm seeing so many names I haven't seen

85
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,140
in years tonight in chat.

86
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,100
So I just I really want to say thank you and show the love back.

87
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,780
And also I am just blown away.

88
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,540
I don't even know the word vocabulary.

89
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,820
I failed tonight.

90
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,020
One of my co-hosts has to help me is that you all are so generous.

91
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,260
Like we had a hype train level five before the show even went live.

92
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,620
And that's huge.

93
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,980
And I will I will read all your names and acknowledge you after the show.

94
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,660
For those that haven't been here in a while, because we're doing this on Twitch TV, we don't you really do it

95
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,340
like other Twitch channels because we're recording our podcast.

96
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,740
So we don't like to do that awkward stop every time someone donates and say, hey, Dark Sakura, thanks for the sub.

97
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,940
But we will acknowledge.

98
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,660
Please, please know we see you.

99
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,780
It's I'm looking at some of these bitty totals.

100
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,700
This is astounding. People are donating like a thousand bits, twenty seven hundred bits at a time.

101
00:06:52,540 --> 00:07:00,580
The hype train, twenty four gifts and sorry, twenty four subs and six thousand four hundred and thirty bits.

102
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,900
That's screenshotted at four hundred and four percent huge.

103
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,820
I'm just like I I'm not going to cry tonight because I said I'm not going to fucking do it.

104
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,300
Do it. But your your generosity is amazing.

105
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,740
And thank you. You really have been the motivation to be here.

106
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:24,660
Throughout the shitty pandemic and everything else going on in the world, which I do need to call this out.

107
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,220
We are a video game podcast.

108
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,860
We talk about gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, but and we're celebrating tonight.

109
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,260
This is a huge celebration.

110
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:41,380
No other live Internet show that's weekly that we know of has gotten to 20 years, at least in the video game world.

111
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,660
Maybe some tech shows out there.

112
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,020
I just I can't follow everything.

113
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,100
But in the video game world, there's no like weekly Internet show that's gotten to 20 years.

114
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,740
So this is this is really historic.

115
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,580
And I'm saying that with all humility and humbleness that this is it's because of you guys.

116
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,540
And it's really that drive there.

117
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,740
And we're celebrating tonight.

118
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,540
But we is a night to do some horn tooting.

119
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,020
Yeah. Yeah, I know it is.

120
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,860
It is. But I'm going to be honest.

121
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,980
And you all know, I don't shy away from these topics.

122
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,500
We have a platform, even though it is a small platform.

123
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:21,980
And I need to use this platform to say what happened in this country on Friday from the Supreme Court is fucking bullshit.

124
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,380
And you can bold that, underline it, italicize it.

125
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,260
And although, yes, we're celebrating tonight and that's a huge part of what's in our hearts.

126
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,900
There's also a big part of our hearts that is very sad.

127
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:40,580
I am I am so sad for the women and people with uteruses in this country that are affected by this decision.

128
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:50,500
And you know what? We're all affected by this decision because we all have a wife or a sister or a niece or a cousin or a daughter or a mother, et cetera, et cetera.

129
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,540
We all have someone that is affected by this.

130
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,540
And I'm going to say this very bluntly.

131
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,300
If you haven't had an abortion, you know someone who has.

132
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,740
And this affects everything.

133
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,620
And yes, I am well aware.

134
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,660
Thank you for the five thousand messages directed at me that said they're coming for you next.

135
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,420
I'm well aware they're coming for all of us.

136
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,780
Clarence Thomas said it himself already.

137
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:29,260
Of course, you want to know who is also responsible for getting Clarence Thomas instated as a justice?

138
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,060
Our president.

139
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,140
Yeah, believe Anita Hill.

140
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,500
Yeah.

141
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:48,540
Anyway, I do want to try to keep the mood celebratory on our show, but it would be irresponsible of us to not say something about that situation and acknowledge that it's some bullshit.

142
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,620
There are a lot of funds out there that you can donate to.

143
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,620
The number one thing you can do is make noise and talk to people.

144
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:04,020
You have to remember there's another side of this argument that uses the imagery of dead babies to try to control people.

145
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,220
And that's what it is.

146
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,580
This is about control.

147
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:22,220
And when people don't even know science, when people say dead babies, that's what they're trying to do is use that horrific imagery to control you and ask anyone who understands what this argument is really about.

148
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,180
It is not about dead babies.

149
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,300
And I'm just going to leave it at that.

150
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,620
Like when you when you say that, you just tell me that you're only listening to shock imagery.

151
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,300
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,580
As the person on this podcast who owns a uterus, I would like to make a comment, please.

153
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,180
I'm going to go into a little bit of science on here.

154
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,980
Number one, there is not a heartbeat when people are saying their heartbeat.

155
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,100
It's electrical pulses.

156
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,460
There's no heart formed to beat.

157
00:10:51,260 --> 00:11:03,620
Number two, an abortion provided during the first trimester typically is when the fetus is not large enough to require being physically pulled out of the body like they like they claim happen.

158
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,660
Most abortions happen during the first trimester.

159
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:13,740
One is given a pill, one passes the fetus and it hurts and it's terrible.

160
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,860
It is a pain that has it's pretty much on par.

161
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:29,500
Well, maybe not as bad as actual childbirth, but on par with the same pressures the body goes through, not to mention the hormonal imbalances after the fact.

162
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:41,620
And then on top of that, you know, say that you're somebody who is who's wanted this child, has carried it, and then you find out that the pregnancy isn't viable, that it could kill you.

163
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,220
And you have to make that decision.

164
00:11:44,620 --> 00:12:13,180
People who have to make that, they're basically condemning many people to death over their religious opinion, which, first of all, bless the satanic temple, I'm sorry, the satanic temple for doing the right work, for going in guns blazing and calling out the religious violation.

165
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,500
And personal violations that this is doing, I love them to bits, I support them in what they do.

166
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,340
And you say this as a proud Jewish person.

167
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,860
I'm also a card carrying Satanist.

168
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,980
Yeah, no, I get it.

169
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,380
I get it.

170
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,740
Yeah.

171
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,820
Well, on top of that, they were actually formed by a Jewish person, just FYI.

172
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:44,980
Anyway, I want to say that every last one of you owes it to yourself to number one, educate yourself on what actually happens in an abortion.

173
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:57,900
Number two, also educate yourself on what happens during childbirth and what a uterus possessing person goes through.

174
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:18,700
On top of that, it's going to make it even harder for lower income women to, I'm going to say women generically in this sense, you know, to go seek out health care for things like endometriosis, which is already a bitch to get diagnosed.

175
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:29,660
I've had several friends not get their endo, what's the word I'm thinking of, diagnosis until they, you know, like eight, 10 years later.

176
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,220
And by that time they can't get pregnant because of the damage done to their bodies.

177
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,660
It's going to make it harder for people who wish to get sterilized to be sterilized.

178
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,580
I was lucky enough that I basically stood my ground when they tried to talk me out of it.

179
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,420
I'm like, it's my body.

180
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,860
I want the shit out.

181
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,140
And we live in California.

182
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,440
Yes.

183
00:13:52,540 --> 00:14:02,380
It's this value that's only placed on women that your value is as an incubator.

184
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,540
And then we're going to go ahead and actually look at the other half of this.

185
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,700
What are they going to do when the child is born?

186
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,300
They're not going to want to support education.

187
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,780
They're not going to want to support the social programs that will help the majority

188
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,580
of low-income families support said children.

189
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,020
They're not going to want to provide them a college education.

190
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,540
And I'll tell you a big thing about that is, and this is why, I mean, if you look back in history,

191
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:38,700
why in some cases it was illegal for the, the quote lower class to seek an education,

192
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,660
because an educated population will make an educated decision.

193
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Especially when it comes time to vote.

194
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,380
I think this is how they hold onto their power.

195
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,660
And we have to take that power back.

196
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,740
We need to get away from Republican and Democrat.

197
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,940
It's time to do something different.

198
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,060
The definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

199
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,660
And right now, and I say this with all the respect to our allies,

200
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:24,540
but if you do not have a uterus and you are trying to claim some of this stuff as fact,

201
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:31,980
when you are incorrect, when your religion has no place in science or government, I don't care.

202
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,780
Shut the fuck up.

203
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,620
Go educate yourself and then come back with an opinion.

204
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,460
And then maybe we'll have a discussion.

205
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,940
And just, just to, to, on a note to end on with this, is that like,

206
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,900
I think the thing that pees me the most about this is that the people that are trying to shut

207
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:55,660
this down and you know it, you watch enough news, you see the people trying to shut this down and

208
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:04,780
you know it either have had or have been the reason for, in most cases, an abortion.

209
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,980
You know it.

210
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,620
You know that to be true.

211
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,660
And it's, it's this hypocrisy that is the most dangerous and deadly thing that

212
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,260
continues to go on in this country.

213
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,140
So look at that.

214
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,620
Oh, go ahead.

215
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,100
I'm even going to go beyond that.

216
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:28,300
And I'm going to say it's not just, we have the people in power providing their line,

217
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,460
even whether or not they actually believe it.

218
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm going to, I'm going to throw that out there.

219
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:38,620
That is the hypocrisy behind it is that any of these rich politicians or anyone in the higher

220
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,820
brackets of income will still be able to go somewhere and get an abortion.

221
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,340
It's going to affect anyone, middle-class and lower income.

222
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:58,540
But the other half of this equation is the willful ignorance of the general population,

223
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,140
the people who believe them with this cult-like mentality.

224
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:09,980
And the moment that you try to introduce an idea that is contrary, and I'm actually thinking

225
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:16,060
of my mother when I say this, that is contrary to their internalized belief system.

226
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:23,340
They react like, like they're having some sort of mental breakdown.

227
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,020
That's the only way I can describe it that they become angry.

228
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,060
They become violent.

229
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:34,060
It's almost like, like this grieving, like they're starting to go into the denial part

230
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,220
of the, of the grieving process because a part of their belief is being attacked and

231
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,580
might die, you know?

232
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:53,260
And it has to be that we need to find a way to introduce education in so undeniable and

233
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:59,580
digestible of a way that they have no choice but to learn the truth.

234
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:07,820
And that's, we have a handful of people with archaic ideas that don't reflect the majority

235
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,540
of people in this country creating the decisions for the people in this country.

236
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:20,460
Anyway, we've just spent multiple minutes at the top of what is supposed to be our biggest

237
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,580
episode ever talking about this issue.

238
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,940
And I think this should show how serious it is, I would think.

239
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,140
So with that, we will put the soapbox back behind the curtain for the moment.

240
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,700
Anyhow, I do want to, of course, say hello to those of you that are in our chat room

241
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,620
over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where you're getting, or, you know, we're getting

242
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,700
a lot of cheers and support in chat for the soapbox that we are currently standing on.

243
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,500
But I do want to point out some of the other comments in chat.

244
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,540
Let's see, Pod Culture talking about the celebration and all that earlier says,

245
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,820
you will have to do it in person next year since the show will be old enough to drink.

246
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,260
You know, we would have loved to have done an in-person show this year.

247
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:12,140
I think the, just the, still the big question mark around the pandemic and everything has

248
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,140
made it difficult to plan.

249
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,060
I think it would have been very frustrating if we had tried to plan an in-person something

250
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,980
and then here comes an outbreak.

251
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,700
I mean, just earlier today I was playing, is it allergies or is it COVID?

252
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,620
Because I'm feeling a little bit eh.

253
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:32,060
Now I took a test and it appears the answer is it's allergies, but you just can't be

254
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,940
too sure right now.

255
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,180
It's a little wild.

256
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,940
Like you're playing the game.

257
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,140
What's the sniffle?

258
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,900
Yeah, exactly.

259
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,060
It's like, what was the game show?

260
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,900
Let's see what's behind door number one.

261
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,300
Exactly.

262
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,340
Is it COVID?

263
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,820
Door number two is the sinus infection.

264
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,620
Door number three, meningitis outbreak in Florida.

265
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,260
Like just the hilarity goes on these days.

266
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,460
Is it monkey pox?

267
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,740
That one was floating too.

268
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,700
I know, I know.

269
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,460
And then let's see, look at your treatment.

270
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,220
You choose box number two, nothing.

271
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,700
You get absolutely nothing.

272
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,340
You so stupid to quote UHF on Wheel of Fish.

273
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,740
Let's see.

274
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:22,620
Going back to our chat, let's see other comments that had or said, Rama said, OLR next year

275
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,900
can officially drink.

276
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,620
Yes.

277
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:30,460
Tyre Con chat says, OLR has been around long before podcasts existed.

278
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,100
Yeah, in a way, yeah.

279
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,980
And again, I don't know.

280
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:42,620
Long is a relative term, but podcasting, I know the first OLR to go edition was in like

281
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,420
December of 2004, January 2005.

282
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,460
It was early.

283
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,500
It was very early.

284
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,620
And I want to say podcasting kind of started probably around 2004.

285
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,300
It probably started the year before we jumped on with our to go edition.

286
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,620
Because the history is, yes, we were a live show on live 365.

287
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,340
Then as soon as podcasting was a thing, we jumped on that.

288
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,540
And then we kind of like merged the two shows together because when we were talking mostly

289
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,820
about music games on the live show, the music game scene kind of went through a drought.

290
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,580
And then we merged the shows and like not even six months later, Guitar Hero came out

291
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,620
and started a big resurgence of music games, but it's fine.

292
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,660
At my house.

293
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,260
Yeah, I love where the show has gone since then.

294
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,300
So there is that.

295
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,020
Oh, I love this.

296
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,420
Fanara in chat.

297
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,980
I love this.

298
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,300
Says OLR lasted five times longer than the Confederacy.

299
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,940
Yes, it has.

300
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,820
Yes, it has.

301
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,300
Amen to that.

302
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,300
Loki, I didn't even tie.

303
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,540
And so speaking of things from OLR's history, I usually ask what's playing behind you on

304
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,100
Twitch.

305
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,860
What is playing behind you on Twitch tonight?

306
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,060
It is a video they posted on the Orange Lounge Radio channel.

307
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,140
I don't know how long ago, 15 years ago, it was probably the last time our YouTube was

308
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,780
actually updated.

309
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,900
It's it's it's the historical press.

310
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,020
It's the historical preservation of the Grand Theft Auto modded death match games I used

311
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,500
to play.

312
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,980
Oh, God, years ago, you know, some of the best gaming moments ever.

313
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,340
It's a good video.

314
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,140
Unfortunately, unfortunately, they had patched that stuff out long ago.

315
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:29,100
But, you know, being experienced or being exposed to that for so long, maybe an even

316
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,540
better Grand Theft Auto player, because it's like, OK, well, you know, here we've been

317
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,980
playing with like nukes and just like rapid fire grenade launchers and stuff.

318
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,940
Now we have to contend with a shotgun.

319
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,300
I think I can handle that.

320
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,740
And so but it was a lot of fun.

321
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,900
If you want to see some OLR blasts from the past, like when we were on the news a couple

322
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:55,020
times, when we have some random ass E3 videos, Loki's video he's talking about now, Loki

323
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,780
drunk playing Mario Kart.

324
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,660
If you want to see all that, like check out the OLR YouTube channel.

325
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,940
It's just Orange Lounge Radio on YouTube.

326
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,700
You can see a lot of crazy shit there.

327
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,100
It's it's pretty rough.

328
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,020
I'm pulling something out of this bag.

329
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,260
All right.

330
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,460
Can I get a comment from chat?

331
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,420
Oh, that's when we were in the paper.

332
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,620
That is the old.

333
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,140
Is that the old place Loki and I lived at?

334
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,780
Yeah, it is.

335
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,340
Yes, it is.

336
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,380
So wild.

337
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,180
That is so wild.

338
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,500
Yep.

339
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,020
That's nice standing up there.

340
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,300
I didn't laminate mine, so mine kind of fell apart.

341
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,620
And this isn't really laminated.

342
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,460
It did yellow out a little bit.

343
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:30,140
I just had this like binder thing that I kept it in forever and it never.

344
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,860
Look at that.

345
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,500
I think that's.

346
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,660
Oh, that's is that Travis?

347
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,060
No, that's somebody else.

348
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,780
I think it's somebody else.

349
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,740
Yeah, that's some dude that there's a guy.

350
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,940
Like, was it about bicycling or something like that?

351
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,060
So the caption on here, Orange Lounge Radio Dance Dance Revolution is a video game in

352
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,860
which players dance on the touch pad to the beat of the music.

353
00:23:52,860 --> 00:24:00,860
Orange Lounge Radio podcast dance music and commentary by podcast creators Matt, Rob and

354
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,100
me.

355
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,380
Oh, my gosh.

356
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,100
It had my unmarried name.

357
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,220
Oh, wow.

358
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,180
I had to literally stop and think about what that name is.

359
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,740
But anyway.

360
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,460
Well, you remember I used to get Jessica's former fiance's mail.

361
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:16,940
No, I know.

362
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,260
I know.

363
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,500
I want to get this comment from chat because I think this is from a blast from the past

364
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,060
listener KevBZ3 in our chat.

365
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,900
If I'm not mistaking, that is the artist formerly known as DDR Kevin.

366
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,020
So hello and great to see you tonight in chat says it's pretty interesting how the whole

367
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:40,060
live to podcast to live trend kind of played out over the last 20 years with the advancement

368
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,300
of various platforms over the time span.

369
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,460
This is so true, Bestie, as the kids would say today.

370
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:53,100
It is fascinating how that live to podcast to live because you may or may not recall

371
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,020
there was a year or two.

372
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,860
It was around the time Final Fantasy 13 was new.

373
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,900
It was probably 2006, 2007 when we were broadcasting this show on Justin TV.

374
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,980
And it wasn't really a blip.

375
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,500
And Bobby had his Friday night gaming show, and he was being told who wants to watch other

376
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,900
people play video games while you do a podcast.

377
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,940
And it isn't that fascinating that now it's the norm.

378
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,980
I'm not trying to like toot our own horn about being like ahead of the curve or whatever,

379
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,060
maybe a little bit, but it does go to show you that generally because I bet we weren't

380
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,700
the only only people in the entire universe either.

381
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,740
You know, many people mentioned they found us through all games, and there were a lot

382
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,940
of people on that network back in the day who are doing very similar things.

383
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,500
So this was a path we forged as indie creators.

384
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,980
So the indie folks really were the trendsetters here, and it wasn't until IGN or whatever

385
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,380
started doing it that it got really cool, I guess.

386
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,140
So there's that.

387
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,620
But yeah, it's wild.

388
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,500
I have other questions that we get asked a lot.

389
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,020
I'm going to get to in a moment, but I have a couple other things I need to get to first.

390
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,620
I have a lot of announcements and things tonight.

391
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,980
OK, so number one, I mentioned that Bobby Black Wolf was not here tonight.

392
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,020
However, Bobby has sent us a special message.

393
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,860
I'm going to apologize to my co-host because the way this show is wired, you're not going

394
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,300
to be able to hear this as the audience does, but I'll recap here at the end.

395
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,020
So I apologize.

396
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,420
So let's go to a special pre-taped message from our pal Bobby Black Wolf.

397
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,540
Hello, OLR.

398
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,060
It's Bobby Black Wolf.

399
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,740
Sorry I couldn't be there live tonight on your 20th anniversary.

400
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,780
I really wanted to be there.

401
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:32,940
I really wanted to be in Sacramento, but instead I'm in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bloomington,

402
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,220
actually, for Summer Games Done Quick 2022.

403
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,300
I am hosting Summer Games Done Quick this year.

404
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,860
I'm going to be hosting early Monday morning as well as Tuesday afternoon.

405
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,580
Check gamesdonequick.com for the schedule for that.

406
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,940
But I wanted to make something and even show you a little bit of what Games Done Quick

407
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,580
looks like when you're not looking at it from their official Twitch stream.

408
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,860
That's what I'm running here.

409
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,700
I'm going to be taking more videos during the week, and I should be back next week so

410
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,380
I can delay OLR's start.

411
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,660
But happy birthday, OLR.

412
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,100
I did not delay your start tonight.

413
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,860
You were able to start on time for your 20th anniversary.

414
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,100
Thank you so much for being a friend to me.

415
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:17,900
And y'all are the reason that I'm still doing this and probably why I'm here at SGDQ.

416
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:23,420
It's because I continued doing the podcast with y'all and being your lead-in, being

417
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,420
your opening band for the past 15, 16 years.

418
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,060
And hopefully we'll be doing it for much longer.

419
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,180
So thank you, OLR.

420
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,620
Congratulations on 20 years on the air.

421
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,780
Well, thank you so much for that, Bobby.

422
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,580
Appreciate it.

423
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,780
And you know we don't consider you an opening act.

424
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,020
We consider you a co-headliner.

425
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,460
So congratulations on going back to Summer Games Done Quick.

426
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,260
I know you guys couldn't hear the audio, but you could probably see the video.

427
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,700
And obviously he's showing a little bit of what Summer Games looks like when it's not

428
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,940
on Twitch, like what it actually looks like there in person.

429
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,100
And boy, you can see the precautions they're taking this year.

430
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,860
Like everything is spaced out.

431
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,060
That arcade, that was wild.

432
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,860
But I mean, I'm glad they're taking it seriously.

433
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,180
And I'm glad they're allowing people that are even, because my understanding is there's

434
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,500
quite a few immunocompromised people that are either involved with Games Done Quick

435
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,860
or are speedrunners or a variety of those things.

436
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,500
So it's really great that while there's a lot of people that are just like, eh, COVID's

437
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,020
done with, it's really great that they are still like going above and beyond and taking

438
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,820
those precautions.

439
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,100
And it's how nice to have something like that back.

440
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,140
So Bobby will definitely be watching, not just when you are doing donations, but I'm

441
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,980
sure throughout the week as well.

442
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,420
That'll be really cool.

443
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,060
So thank you for that message.

444
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,940
Really appreciate that.

445
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,940
OK, I have another kind of special-ish announcement.

446
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:54,940
And the interesting thing about this is that it is actually nothing that myself, Dark Sakura,

447
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,820
or Loki did.

448
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,500
So it's a special little treat for Orange Lounge Radio's 20th anniversary.

449
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,020
And this is something that Dark Tetsuya actually put together.

450
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,860
I think he had a lot of help with this.

451
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:12,140
I don't know all of the people that helped with this, but it is a new website.

452
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:17,820
And if you want to get to this website, it's bit.ly.

453
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:29,180
So that traditional URL shortener, bit.ly slash o-l-r-cive and the number two, because

454
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:34,380
o-l-r-cive one was gone, the skydrive or whatever folded.

455
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:42,380
So o-l-r-cive two is a new archive of Blast from the Past of the show.

456
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,900
If you want to go back and listen to episode one, you can do that.

457
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,540
It's here for you.

458
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,140
In fact, he actually even broke it up into seasons.

459
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,260
I believe this is just about every single live episode of the show we ever did is here.

460
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,260
And I'll come back to this in a minute because there's another exciting thing here too.

461
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,700
And then even some of the specials, I didn't even remember we did a Christmas special in

462
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,580
2007.

463
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,140
There was the roast to Travis and whatever.

464
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,980
The best April Fool's joke we ever did, the giggling lesbian gaming show is here.

465
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,020
You can get all of it.

466
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,460
It's all on the o-l-r-cive.

467
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,180
I am going to give the usual disclaimer that I give when it comes to Orange Launch Radio

468
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,660
old shit.

469
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:30,220
This is a 20 year old show and the humor and the jokes and the catch phrases that we may

470
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,580
have said back in 2002 would not necessarily be things we would say today.

471
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,580
I hope you all know that, but you and I both know that there are haters out there in the

472
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,660
world that would love nothing more than to crawl through these archives and look for

473
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:50,220
something where maybe I repeated hot T word mess because I heard it on an episode of Project

474
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,660
Runway and thought it was funny.

475
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,220
And I didn't realize until a few years ago, it actually isn't funny to a large group of

476
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,700
people.

477
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,780
So I stopped saying that.

478
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,620
So I just want to kind of put that out there as the general disclaimer when it comes to

479
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,100
old shit.

480
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,380
Please treat it like it is old shit.

481
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,500
But thank you very much to Dark Tits, I almost said Dark Soccer.

482
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,420
Well, thank you to Dark Soccer for being a part of those shows.

483
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,620
Thank you to Dark Tits for putting that all together.

484
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,500
Now, here's the part where it gets wild.

485
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,540
Not only to Dark Tits put together that whole archive of shows, but last year we went back

486
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,500
and listened to episode one of Orange Launch Radio.

487
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,300
And there was kind of a joke that was being said that, oh, maybe next year you should

488
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
go back and listen to episode two.

489
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,700
And the answer was we can't because the recording of episode two was so fucked up.

490
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,780
It has popping all over the place.

491
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:49,580
It has just all this, like the MP3 is broken and it is unlistenable.

492
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,300
Well, guess what?

493
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:56,700
If you go to the new oil archive, which I hope somebody's put that URL in chat by now,

494
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:04,140
you're going to notice in season one, this episode two is the 2022 remastered version.

495
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:13,420
Dark Tits Suya went through that entire episode, three hour episode, cut out every single pop

496
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,820
and adjusted the pitch to make it coherent.

497
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:25,260
It is a little rough on the ears still because it's a little garbled, but you can still

498
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,940
at least understand what we're saying.

499
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:33,820
And I am just impressed at the fact that that is that is like, do you remember in

500
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:40,380
returns the best Batman movie when the penguin went through all the shredded documents that

501
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,940
that Shrek did and he held them up and he said a whole lot of patience will get you

502
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,660
a long way.

503
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,660
And he like had the whole things all stitched back together that had been through the shredder.

504
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:56,060
It's very that so kudos to Dark Tits Suya, our very own penguin here at Orange Lounge

505
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,500
Radio for putting that whole thing back together.

506
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,980
That is more than impressive.

507
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,380
And I want to say thank you for that.

508
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,220
And Dark Tits Suya says you have no idea how long that took me.

509
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,820
I can guess that is that is wild, wild, wild.

510
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,420
And G.G. Rama is going, bro, I would have helped you on that.

511
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,220
Good shit, man.

512
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,720
Good shit.

513
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:25,340
So, yeah, but that is that is a little gift from the community to us and the community.

514
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,660
And honestly, Dark Soccer, Loki and I can really sit here and say we had nothing to

515
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,160
do with that.

516
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,720
They did nothing.

517
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,920
It's a secret to everyone.

518
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,280
Yeah, it was a secret to everyone, no, I mean, he clued us in about a month ago.

519
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,840
He was working on it, but I didn't know he well, because you don't really all our forms,

520
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,340
but that's all right.

521
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,920
Yeah, I know you have the forms.

522
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,200
No, that we have that secret of our form, but it doesn't matter.

523
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,680
So, you know, I actually I couldn't get into it.

524
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,120
I know you were having problems.

525
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,520
It's fine.

526
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,480
It's whatever.

527
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,920
But oh, whoops.

528
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,440
Now I just let out a big secret.

529
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,680
Now people in shadow like the forums are still active.

530
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,120
No, no, they're gone.

531
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,040
There's nothing for you to see there.

532
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,440
We have a 20 year confession time.

533
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,880
We have a hidden forum.

534
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,640
That's why they're still up at all, where we still collaborate on what's going to be

535
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,840
on the show every week.

536
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,920
So it's so we can like story dump our stories and all that good stuff.

537
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,640
So that's the only email Rob that shit.

538
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,220
All right.

539
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,360
So moving on into our kickoff topic tonight, which usually we would tackle a topic in

540
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,800
the gaming industry.

541
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,560
But tonight I thought, eh, you know what the big headline is tonight?

542
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,640
We're turning 20.

543
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,480
So let's make the kickoff topic about us.

544
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,960
So we'll talk about Gamescom or some of this other stuff later.

545
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,240
Let's talk about us a little bit.

546
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,320
And I would like to go through and talk a little bit as we reflect.

547
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,760
We like to raise a toast to me.

548
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,240
I love that.

549
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,880
Yes, I'd like to.

550
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,440
What is the thing you and Dan always say?

551
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,760
I'd like to raise a toast to ourselves and who's like us, damn few.

552
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,080
Oh, no, that's not us that came up with that.

553
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,440
Oh, I thought it's like who's like us, damn few.

554
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,160
And they're all dead.

555
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,600
Okay, that's it.

556
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:10,960
All right.

557
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,880
So I thought maybe to go back on 20 years of OLR, I have assembled a list of questions

558
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,280
tonight that are the most common questions we get having a 20 year old podcast.

559
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,760
And I thought we could go through and answer them.

560
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,360
So y'all ready for some Q&A?

561
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,080
Y'all ready?

562
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,580
All right.

563
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,680
So the first question I'd like to go over tonight is what's the secret to keeping a

564
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,360
show or podcast going for 20 years?

565
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,720
So what's the secret to keeping this shit up for 20 years?

566
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,240
Routine and unwilling to change your routine, I guess.

567
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,400
Can you elaborate on that?

568
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,560
Like, what do you mean by like unwilling to change routine?

569
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,280
Because like, this is what I do every Sunday.

570
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,160
So I don't know what I guess I'd play more Minecraft if it wasn't doing this.

571
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,760
But yeah, before that, you know, it this is just what I do every Sunday.

572
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
So it's, you know, it's routine at this point.

573
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,040
Dark Sakura?

574
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,760
Make it a routine.

575
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,200
I have no idea.

576
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,960
I can speak to a diet like this.

577
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,760
Being stubborn?

578
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,560
I think actually, as much as you may say that tongue in cheek, I think there's definitely

579
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,600
some truth in this to that.

580
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,880
I think stubbornness.

581
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:32,000
There's a lot of, not a lot, but there's memorable people out there that hoped this

582
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,800
show would fail.

583
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:41,040
There are people out there that will still try to discredit this show as whatever it

584
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,680
is, I'm sure.

585
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,640
Let me know so I can kick him in the teeth or something.

586
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,080
Well, you know, back in the DDR days, there were certain people in the community that

587
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,000
didn't like us for whatever reason.

588
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,640
Yeah, but we're still here and they're not.

589
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,160
Bingo, bingo.

590
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,240
So one of the biggest haters I can think of worked in the game industry for a little while.

591
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
And then as far as I know, isn't anymore.

592
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,040
So it's just something that's just interesting.

593
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,440
Spite.

594
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,480
Spite motivates me.

595
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:10,800
Yeah.

596
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,640
Spite is a huge motivator, to be honest.

597
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,760
And actually it is a good bit of spite on my part, because as Questbuster just said,

598
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,480
success is the best revenge in a way.

599
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,040
Yeah, it is.

600
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,920
I mean, this show is going to have to end someday and I don't want it to be seen as

601
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,120
a failure when it does.

602
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,880
But the fact that Loki's kids are going to take it over and they're too lazy for that.

603
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,080
I don't think it's going to happen.

604
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,520
The fact that we've gotten to this point and really achieve something that no other show

605
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,240
has, well, I shouldn't say show, but like no other video game related Internet show

606
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,120
or whatever has, is huge.

607
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,880
And even to, you know, there is a club of shows out there that have gone past 10 years.

608
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,160
You know, Bobby's in that.

609
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,720
And that is no small achievement.

610
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,560
Hell, shit, getting past one year is a huge achievement.

611
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,320
And all of that is to be celebrated, whether Spite got you there or what it is.

612
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,360
My answer would be pretty similar to Loki, though, is that when you make it part of your

613
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:16,320
routine, and it's tricky because you don't want your show to be a job, but you do want

614
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,480
to treat it like a valued hobby.

615
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,880
And I would say to many people, that's church, you know, and many people make church their

616
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,400
thing that they do every Sunday and they get up and they do it.

617
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,320
So in a way, OLR is like church.

618
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,280
And I don't, I don't mean to, especially in light of the things we were talking about

619
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,640
earlier in the show, I don't want to make it sound like sacrilegious or that this is

620
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,760
the replacement for that.

621
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,320
It is not.

622
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,520
But just that that is like the mentality of this, if that makes sense.

623
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,040
So what you're saying is we need to file for a tax exempt status as a church.

624
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,800
I'm reading you.

625
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah, absolutely.

626
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,200
Absolutely.

627
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,040
So let's see.

628
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,240
Looking at some other comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, Tigerthon

629
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,000
chat says having stuff to talk about every week, even during times when there was no

630
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,480
news, you always find something to talk about.

631
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,880
Well, you guys were a huge part of that.

632
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,920
And without sucking up too much, I do want to say, I think the choice for us to have

633
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,000
a live chat ever since the first day, keep that in mind, we were on IRC ever since the

634
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,960
first day, we've always had a live chat and a audience element.

635
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,600
We were taking calls via Skype.

636
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,840
I'm convinced I can't claim this in good faith.

637
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:43,760
I'm convinced no other show, none, took live calls via Skype before we did.

638
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,600
I am confident we were the first, but unfortunately, I can't prove it.

639
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,000
Maybe the SOL Archive will help.

640
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,560
I have to dig up.

641
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,840
Wait, it's likely.

642
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,360
Yeah, it's very likely.

643
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,280
And again, I'm not trying to toot our own horn.

644
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,240
Indies did pave the way, but I'm just trying to say that that element and that freshness,

645
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,000
that unsurprisingly, or that surprisingness that all that listener elements, I think really

646
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,120
have kept us on our toes.

647
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,840
And what TigerClaw said has allowed there to be something to talk about on this show

648
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,240
when it feels like there's nothing else to talk about because there's always community.

649
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,960
There's always what's going on in our brains and in our hearts.

650
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,840
Or as you heard earlier in the show, what's going on in the real world that's affecting

651
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,520
us that because we're a family of sorts that have been together in similarity with church,

652
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,840
we're a family of sorts that have been together the last 20 years.

653
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,720
There are things in the real world that affect us as well.

654
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,040
That sometimes we have to get off our chest before we get to the games.

655
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,960
It's all a part of it.

656
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,200
So let's see.

657
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,840
Looking at some other class, Sean 322 in chat says routine is a good answer.

658
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,640
Sunday nights are known for The Simpsons and OLR.

659
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,000
Hey, there's something that's longer than this show.

660
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,520
The Simpsons run on TV.

661
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,040
We can't beat that.

662
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,080
We sure can't.

663
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,600
We just have more episodes on them, though.

664
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,280
Oh, yeah.

665
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,680
Have we?

666
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,160
Yeah, we do.

667
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,360
By a lot.

668
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,600
Yeah.

669
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,600
A normal TV show or whatever puts out only about, what, 23 episodes a year, and we've

670
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,280
done closer to 45.

671
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,160
I mean, you would think with 52 weeks in a year, we should be past episode 1000.

672
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,760
And I said this when another podcast crossed that threshold of 1000.

673
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,640
Well, that's a huge achievement, and I'm not going to yuck someone's yum.

674
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,040
But they do multiple episodes a week sometimes.

675
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
And during E3, I think they did a ton of them.

676
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,160
So I mean, that's great.

677
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,920
But that's still a huge achievement.

678
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,800
1000 episodes.

679
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,080
We do take a week off here and there.

680
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,120
So we haven't been 1000 weeks in a row.

681
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,520
But real life happens.

682
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,080
Yeah.

683
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,880
We've never missed more than two weeks in a row.

684
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,040
And it takes a bit like when my mom passed, we missed two weeks in a row.

685
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,480
That was, you know, and there's been a couple other instances.

686
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,880
But otherwise, I would say we've always gotten at least two episodes out in a month.

687
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,280
Always.

688
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,160
So there's that, if nothing else.

689
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,680
Salvelus in chat says, 20 years old, still a twink.

690
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,640
Yeah, there's that.

691
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,440
There's that.

692
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,960
All right, let's get to the next question.

693
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:18,480
Next question is, what's been the biggest story in the past 20 years?

694
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,960
We've covered a lot of stories.

695
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,560
Remember, these are the most common questions we get.

696
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,280
We've covered a lot of stuff here on OLR.

697
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,160
What's been the biggest story in the past 20 years?

698
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,660
Loki?

699
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,200
Of course, come to me first.

700
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,680
Like, I don't know.

701
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,640
There's like so much.

702
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,760
Where do you even choose?

703
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,680
I would say probably.

704
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:43,760
I don't know.

705
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,160
Gosh, if I'm going to have to pick something, I would say.

706
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,240
The announcement of Bungee Ferret talk scene.

707
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,120
That was a pretty amazing story that didn't get covered by the mainstream media.

708
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:12,320
No, but I love that answer, because those little OLR cameos in other video games have

709
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,560
been quite the treat for us and quite the reward that even.

710
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,040
And yes, there's been those times where the three of us are extraordinarily frustrated

711
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,800
that we didn't get bigger.

712
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,160
We're not more well known.

713
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,560
And that's OK.

714
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,280
I made peace with that a long time ago myself, because I also realized I don't have the time

715
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,640
that a show needs to really work on that social networking presence to get the show as well

716
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,480
known as it probably needs to be.

717
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,880
I think people that are very well known, it's usually their jobs or something they've been

718
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,600
able to dedicate a lot more time to than I've been able to.

719
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,240
And that's OK.

720
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,200
But those little things like somebody made a text adventure game.

721
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,120
That was the very first one way back in the day.

722
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,880
It was a text adventure OLR game.

723
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,840
And then, of course, YYRS Bungee Ferret tossing was huge.

724
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,080
And then the little cameos that certain unnamed people.

725
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,640
I can't tell you who they are, but it lets you know you got friends in high places.

726
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,120
When we showed up in like the Namco Museum on PlayStation 3, and I just talked about

727
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,240
this like four weeks ago on the show.

728
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,160
But as a reminder, because we have some folks who have been here for a while on the PlayStation

729
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,960
3 of Namco Museum, when you boot up the game, it shows you a sample high score table.

730
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,920
And the high score table says Dark Sakura Sky, which was the name I went by for a long

731
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,120
time, Loki.

732
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,120
And then I think it's like Tangle or something.

733
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,360
They couldn't use Tingle, but they were trying to make a joke of Loki as Tingle as a lot

734
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,640
of people have over the years.

735
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,720
So it was like Tangle or something else like that.

736
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,520
So and that's in a game.

737
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,320
And there was a game on the Wii, an RPG on the Wii.

738
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,640
And I can't remember that it started with an O.

739
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,200
Apuna?

740
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,840
Was that the game?

741
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,880
Yes, it was Apuna.

742
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,040
Our logo is in it.

743
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,080
It doesn't say OLR.

744
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,240
Do you remember the old, old OLR logo?

745
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,560
It's not one we use anymore because it was designed by my ex.

746
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,200
And this is before Jamie had her degree.

747
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,080
It was that little orange looking thing with the stem.

748
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,880
I think it's still on our website because our website's that old.

749
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,080
But that little thing that's in the Apuna game.

750
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,480
So it's very subtle little things like that.

751
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,560
So and that's amazing.

752
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,600
So thank you.

753
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,560
Thank you for that.

754
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
So yeah, the gamer tag.

755
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,080
Yeah, yeah.

756
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,240
Def says the gamer tag for OLR.

757
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,600
That was pretty incredible as well.

758
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:31,280
So and that was because of our relationship with all games and the great years we had

759
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:32,400
there.

760
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:38,240
And it also goes to show together we are stronger and can leverage things like that.

761
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,480
So that's all good memories.

762
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:50,000
So yeah, I think for us personally, over the last 20 years, yeah, little cameos in video

763
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,240
games and in the industry have really shown that we've made it in a weird way.

764
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,440
So thank you for that.

765
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,160
Dark Soccer, do you want to tackle the question?

766
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,080
What's been the biggest story of the past 20 years for you?

767
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,440
The most common questions we get?

768
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,080
I don't know.

769
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:14,080
I mean, there's been like so many actually big stories that I can't really put a finger

770
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,120
on a single one.

771
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:23,280
But I reckon for me, like the thing that I guess for something I guess that would have

772
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,400
happened would have been.

773
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,760
The the just the various like news coverage, maybe the president cat thing.

774
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,080
Oh, yeah, when that happened, that was the one time we did kind of break through a little

775
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,000
bit and we all were tweeting the president cat company trying to get that game, which

776
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,720
was never called.

777
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,680
We gave it that name.

778
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,840
Jamie gave it that name because she was like, this name kind of translates to this.

779
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:55,600
I said that it was sort of like and I meant president as in a president of a company or

780
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,240
and everyone was like President Cat.

781
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,800
And I'm like, it's not quite what that means.

782
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,360
That's all right.

783
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,000
That's all right.

784
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,800
But it caught on.

785
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,040
It was, you know, because that was that was the same year Obama got elected the first

786
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:07,280
time.

787
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,960
It must have been 2008, right?

788
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,480
So it was the same year he got elected the first time because I remember people were

789
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,240
making the posters that look like his and everything that had President Cat on it.

790
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,440
So, yeah, that was pretty, pretty stunning.

791
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,360
I've had a little time to think about this question, so I'll give you an answer here.

792
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,680
I've got it's really hard for me to not give two and I'll explain why.

793
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,440
So my first answer, I would say the biggest story of the past 20 years is probably the

794
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,640
launch of Xbox Live and that.

795
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:40,240
But the thing is, Xbox Live launched six months after this show did.

796
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,240
November of 2002 is when Xbox Live started.

797
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:52,080
So it's been interesting because we've been able to, like, follow that through the

798
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,680
years and see how that has changed gaming's culture.

799
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,600
Xbox Live and the online play and the voice chat has really changed gaming culture.

800
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:07,920
And I would say evolutions of that, which would be like Discord, quite frankly, are

801
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,280
things that we relied on during the pandemic to keep us gamers connected.

802
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,680
We've always lamented the deaths of arcades here on this show.

803
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,240
Well, in 2020, arcades weren't an option.

804
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,040
So it was because of technology that Xbox Live, I think, started or really made mainstream.

805
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,760
I mean, some would argue that computer chat clients like Ventrilo or whatever that predate

806
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:31,920
that.

807
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,640
But I would argue that Xbox Live made it mainstream because it put it on consoles for

808
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,600
the first time.

809
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,600
And I think Xbox Live is probably the biggest thing that's happened in the last 20 years,

810
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,160
to be honest.

811
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,120
So that would be that.

812
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:54,880
But since that is sort of around the same time we started, I would say the other one

813
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,800
that was definitely something we saw the beginning, the middle and the continuation of, I

814
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,720
would say the biggest story in gaming in the last 20 years was the launch of Pokemon Go.

815
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,320
I think.

816
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,360
And the reason why I say that is that we all remember the summer of 2016.

817
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,440
We all remember.

818
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,240
For some people and some conspiracy theorists, that was the summer before the world ended.

819
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,000
And now we're in an alternate universe desperate to get back.

820
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:35,840
And I think Pokemon Go was a huge part of that because our generation grew up as kids

821
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,320
pretending, you know, maybe those of us here behind the mics right now were maybe a little

822
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,760
more college age.

823
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,680
But we still come from a generation that was like, you know what, mom, I'm going to leave

824
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,880
the house for an hour.

825
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,400
I'm going out to hunt some Pokemon.

826
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,320
And that became a reality in 2016.

827
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:04,800
And I think as well, I think the other thing of that is that it really legitimized mobile

828
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,880
phone gaming, which I think up until that point, most people were writing off mobile

829
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,080
gaming, including me most of the time, as a bunch of crap because a lot of it was a

830
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,200
bunch of crap.

831
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,240
Or it was stuff where they were trying to force things like, say, a Sonic 2 port or

832
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:22,400
so.

833
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,640
I don't know why I'm picking on that, but I am a Sonic 2 port that's playable on iPhone

834
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,600
and Android that kind of blows because they try to make a traditional controller work

835
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,280
with a touch controller and it doesn't work.

836
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,040
But Pokemon Go was designed not just with touch controls and that sort of thing in mind,

837
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:48,560
but to use your location in the real world to pinpoint and really be the first real AR

838
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,480
gaming in the world.

839
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,320
I think that was a huge moment for video games.

840
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,720
And as much as folks joke about Pokemon Go as a dead game, and we even have a story coming

841
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,800
up on it later tonight, I still think it's earned its place in the history books because

842
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,400
if nothing else, that summer we all needed it and we all loved it and we all experienced

843
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:08,880
that.

844
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,800
And mobile phone gaming broke through like it never had before, as had AR gaming.

845
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,640
So that's my take on the biggest story of the last 20 years.

846
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,800
Okay, let's go to the next question.

847
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:30,800
What's been your favorite video game of the last 20 years, but besides DDR and Bimani,

848
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,720
because that would be too easy considering that is where this show started.

849
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:40,000
So what has been your favorite video game of the last 20 years besides DDR and Bimani

850
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,640
type of stuff?

851
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,760
I'll start with this one.

852
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,400
It's actually a tricky one, but I think at the end of the day, I'm going to say Mass

853
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:52,960
Effect 3.

854
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,840
It would be series, isn't it?

855
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,200
So then just Mass Effect series?

856
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,360
Yeah, because that's really what it is.

857
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,880
It's the Mass Effect series.

858
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,120
The reason why I call out 3 in particular was that the multiplayer put so many more

859
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:10,640
hours in it, and I didn't hate the story the way the internet did, although I get it, you

860
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,440
know, and all that stuff.

861
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,280
I get why people were upset with it.

862
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,560
And yeah, again, versus Mass Effect 2 even, but just the whole trilogy is really what

863
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,520
it is for me.

864
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:26,080
And I think that was just the game that I played where I was like, God, I'm so attached

865
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,280
to these characters.

866
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:36,240
I'm so captured by this game and this experience, and it had that and getting to kill aliens

867
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,800
with friends online and that whole mode and that.

868
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,440
And I think I just got so many good hours out of that.

869
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,840
I mean, yeah, I probably sunk more hours and like Final Fantasy 14 or maybe even World

870
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,200
of Warcraft, really, if we're talking the last 20 years, I probably sunk more hours

871
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,840
in those games.

872
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:55,040
But I think just overall, when I walked away from the experience going, wow, that was a

873
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:01,840
video game I was really happy to play, and that was a fucking great video game, I think

874
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,000
was the Mass Effect series.

875
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,840
A close second, Journey, which we just talked about a couple of weeks on the show when Dark

876
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,520
Soccer picked it for the Classic Game of the Week.

877
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,640
I think Journey on the PlayStation 3 is a very close runner up.

878
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,960
To my co-host, Dark Soccer, favorite video game of the last 20 years, not DDR?

879
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:27,120
I'm going to go with the Mass Effect series and I'm going to go with Dead by Daylight.

880
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,920
I mean, those are just the biggest two off the top of everything.

881
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:40,480
But I mean, honestly, if I was going to go for something more overall, I would also just

882
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:49,120
throw in like the whole Beatmania series, like five key Beatmania, because that's kind

883
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:57,680
of what got me started back in on the path was playing BM98 back in 98 before there was

884
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,520
an Orange Lounge radio, before I had moved to the state.

885
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:01,760
Right.

886
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,720
Well, if it wasn't for those games, we would know each other.

887
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,200
And that's the simplest that really.

888
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,800
Yeah, I wouldn't have been shaking my butt on Para Para the first day we hung out.

889
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,040
Yeah.

890
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,000
All right, Loki, what about you?

891
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,640
What's been your favorite video game of the last 20 years?

892
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:24,320
If I had to pick which game I had the most fun in outside of DDR.

893
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,120
It's going to be Grand Theft Auto four.

894
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:32,640
I had a feeling for sure that it's by far the most fun I've had in a video game.

895
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,560
Close second would have to be Minecraft.

896
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,680
And then probably after that, I would say.

897
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,360
Like Skyrim, probably.

898
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,400
Oh, OK.

899
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,120
It's a good answer.

900
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,040
Yeah, lots of multiple games.

901
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,280
Yep, that is the key.

902
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,160
I love it.

903
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,440
Let's go to chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

904
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,440
E3VL says Persona 5 Royal.

905
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,400
Savalus says Flappy Bird.

906
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,680
I think that might be a little bit tongue in cheek, but you know, you want to talk about

907
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,160
mobile games that really stopped the world for a hot minute.

908
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:04,960
That would be there.

909
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:11,280
Bonds 006 kind of left a whole list, but it started with Rock Band.

910
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,000
That's a clever way around the DDR Bamani rule.

911
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,240
Dark Tetsuya says La Mulana.

912
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:18,960
No surprise here.

913
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,000
I know you love that game.

914
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,640
I know you love it.

915
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,080
Some of the comments on biggest stories of the past 20 years as well, because I didn't

916
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:26,800
read from that.

917
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,600
Savalus says Leroy Jenkins.

918
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,360
You know what?

919
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,400
I'm pretty sure the biggest meme of the 20 years.

920
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,480
Yeah, Savalus is probably trolling a little bit, which by the way, is Grandpa from Hoard

921
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,920
House, who also said the biggest news story of the last 20 years was when Hoard House

922
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,560
launched.

923
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,680
So hi, Grandpa.

924
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,520
But memes are a huge part of gaming culture now.

925
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,200
And I would say Leroy Jenkins was one of the first.

926
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,480
I don't think you could say the first, but one of the first that just caught on, you

927
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,000
know, that and YouTube's launch kind of was the perfect storm of a meme, you know?

928
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,160
So I'll even say this.

929
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,840
I will, at regular intervals, find a survivor with Jenkins in their name.

930
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,480
In Dead by Daylight.

931
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,160
I love that.

932
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,360
Let's see.

933
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,040
SheHulk10 saying, I thought Loki played Saints Row and GTA 4 the most.

934
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,040
I would imagine Saints Row is somewhere in your list of like top 10 at least.

935
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,040
Yeah, it's like top 10 for sure.

936
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,540
For sure.

937
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,680
All right, let's get to some more questions.

938
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,480
I have two more questions.

939
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,120
Two more questions.

940
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,040
Let's get to the next one.

941
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,400
Next one is what advice do you remember?

942
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,320
These are the most common questions we get.

943
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,520
And I know I get this one at least once a year.

944
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:50,560
What advice do you have for people wanting to start a new podcast or if you will, because

945
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,120
that's kind of where it's going these days, a new stream or YouTube?

946
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,400
And this is something, you know, Loki does YouTube, Dark Sakura streams, as do I on the

947
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,520
side outside of OLR.

948
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,200
And of course, collectively, we do a podcast.

949
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,800
What advice do you have for people wanting to start a new podcast?

950
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,160
Does anyone want to jump in and go first?

951
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,720
I will start because I literally gave advice to somebody on Thursday.

952
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,280
Okay.

953
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,520
Who actually already has an amazing Twitch channel.

954
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,160
It's the Elk Grove Pinball Twitch.

955
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:20,800
Oh, sure.

956
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,960
But he is wondering why he couldn't set up, you know, subs or anything, and it's because

957
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,920
he hadn't fit the requirements for affiliate yet.

958
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,800
Right.

959
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:43,520
And so I was like, the key, I think, to making it as a streamer or podcaster or, or any

960
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:53,120
of these things is to be consistent and to have your niche and to have something that

961
00:57:53,120 --> 00:58:02,320
you're offering that no one else really has, or a flavor of something that people enjoy.

962
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,000
I mean, I think, I don't know if this is right.

963
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,200
I think that the followers that I have like to hear me complain during the match and then

964
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:24,320
be all sweetness and sunshine in the endgame chat, you know, or just, you know, trying

965
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:29,120
to do things in hard mode with, you know, this thumb track ball controller.

966
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:37,360
Or, you know, you just got to do something that's a little bit different than what everybody

967
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,160
else is doing.

968
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,760
And you have to be consistent.

969
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,960
The consistency is the best part.

970
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,240
And on top of that, you kind of have to be a little bit annoying.

971
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:53,200
You got to pimp yourself out, you know, that's why every time I go live, even though our

972
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,040
orange lounge thing reposts it, I post it.

973
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,040
I post again halfway through.

974
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,200
I do an announcement on my discord.

975
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:10,400
I get, you got to be able to shout your own name out to expect other people to also shout

976
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:10,960
it out too.

977
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,600
And yeah, and like Ron-Chan says, you have to have a love for it.

978
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,400
You have to, you have to, it has to be something that you got to put your heart into.

979
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:26,640
It's like, you know, when I was getting really burned on playing Dead by Daylight all the

980
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,800
time, you know, because it's not super rewarding to always play killer.

981
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:41,280
I would, that's when I brought about my classic SNES RPG two days a week, especially because

982
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,160
it's easier to do when I'm just getting off of work.

983
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:49,520
But, you know, which I put aside during the Dead by Daylight anniversary.

984
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:57,280
And then I also think that having those special one-offs are also good because they keep things

985
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,760
exciting.

986
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,280
They add a little bit more to your formula.

987
00:59:59,280 --> 00:59:59,920
They're special.

988
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:08,400
That's why I do like a subathon or a follow-a-thon like every few months or so.

989
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:15,040
Um, and also I think that it really helps for you to also find a cause to support.

990
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:26,240
Um, like I'm planning on doing, um, a charity stream down the line once I figure out how

991
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,120
I want to handle it.

992
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:36,800
But I also think that I'm not saying use someone else's cause as a platform for yourself, but

993
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:43,120
I mean, get involved in the community and causes that you care about and you get other

994
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,120
people to get involved with you.

995
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:53,600
So being a force for good in your community is a great thing to do as well.

996
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,920
I mean, again, I'm not saying be, be kind for exposure.

997
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:05,360
That is not at all what I'm saying, but I'm saying get yourself involved, be someone who

998
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,160
gets involved in the community around you.

999
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,720
Um, I think you've said, oh, of course you've said a lot of excellent points with streaming.

1000
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:20,880
The only thing I would really add to that is that, um, it can be very frustrating sometimes

1001
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,120
when it feels like no one is watching.

1002
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:27,760
And if you want to be successful on Twitch, you have to get used to the fact that nobody's

1003
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,760
going to be watching for a little while and you still have to be able to put on a show

1004
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,800
for nobody.

1005
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:37,920
And I know that sounds difficult, but keep in mind your viewer count only updates once

1006
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,200
every five minutes.

1007
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,800
You don't know when someone's dropping in just because they happen to come up on the

1008
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,800
recommended or something's going on there.

1009
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,120
So you always, yeah, you always want to act like if nothing else, you've got the camera

1010
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,920
watching.

1011
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,440
And even when it seems like I'm sitting here talking to myself, you know what, tell us

1012
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,720
what's going on in your brain.

1013
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,640
Tell us about the decisions you're making in the game.

1014
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,640
Tell us why you're doing the things you do.

1015
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,880
Tell us, you know, it doesn't always have to be like you have an agenda of topics and

1016
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,440
things like that.

1017
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,640
Just give us some insight to the game that you're playing and that your reactions, your

1018
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,680
thoughts and so forth.

1019
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,840
It goes a long way.

1020
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,400
And when that personality shines through, that's what makes people click the follow

1021
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:14,720
button.

1022
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,520
And I think, you know, and to kind of go back to podcasting a little bit, the only thing

1023
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:25,120
I'd add, because I think you nailed it, with consistency, you have to stick with it.

1024
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:30,960
And the minute you start making excuses, you know what, I'm going to cancel my stream

1025
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,640
tonight because I got to fart.

1026
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:39,360
Like when you start canceling things for stupid reasons, you're just letting it go.

1027
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,160
And so you've got to stick with it.

1028
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,520
And that's why a schedule, I don't make a streaming schedule, but a schedule is very

1029
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,640
important for many people.

1030
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,400
I do have a streaming schedule for this, and that's kept for 20 years.

1031
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,240
And then the last thing I would add to that, you have to have an enthusiasm for what you're

1032
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:56,720
doing.

1033
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:03,840
And I don't mean, hi everybody, hi gay, welcome to Pride Month here at Orange Lounge

1034
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,320
Radio.

1035
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:09,840
I'm not saying you have to have that kind of over enthusiastic type of tone.

1036
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:17,200
I'm just saying you have to enjoy what you're doing because when podcasts really blew up

1037
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,480
when iTunes first launched podcasting and lots of people started doing them, you know

1038
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,080
there were those podcasts that were like, oh, this was so, if you want to go back to

1039
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:29,920
Horde House, there were so many World of Warcraft podcasts where you would download them

1040
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,360
and be like, this fucking game, this fucking game sucks.

1041
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,720
You know, you just play in this game, these changes that they're doing, they suck.

1042
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,480
This whole expansion is terrible.

1043
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,360
And I don't know, these quests are so lame.

1044
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,680
We were doing this raid and the boss was, man, does anyone even test this fucking game?

1045
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:51,360
It's so, what is the product that you're putting out?

1046
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,920
You're not being edgy.

1047
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,280
You're being pathetic.

1048
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:01,200
Because you are, and the reason why I'm saying it, like a true friend is going to tell you

1049
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:06,560
this fact because you're advertising, we're doing a show about gaming and then you're

1050
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,840
sitting there just shitting on games the entire time.

1051
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:15,760
That doesn't mean you can't be critical, especially constructively of games.

1052
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,560
I like to think that's what we do here at OLR all the time.

1053
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,680
And I know Loki gets a lot of shit sometimes from listeners because of Nintendo.

1054
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,360
I'm always constructive.

1055
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,840
But you do, and here we go, y'all ready for me to use a tired analogy?

1056
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,000
Cause I'm gonna do it one more time for the 20th.

1057
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,160
It's when Tyra Banks yelled at that supermodel on America's Next Top Model.

1058
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,440
We were rooting for you.

1059
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,040
We were all rooting for you.

1060
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,000
How dare you?

1061
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,840
That is what Nintendo makes us feel sometimes with some of their choices.

1062
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,200
They'll get with this century eventually.

1063
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,280
They're just only a couple decades behind.

1064
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:49,780
It's fine.

1065
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,080
So anyway, Loki, I want to give you a chance to chime in, too.

1066
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:01,040
What advice do you have for people wanting to start a new podcast or stream or YouTube

1067
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,480
or what have you, any of those things, really?

1068
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:06,320
Like we went back before, it's consistency for sure.

1069
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:12,160
You want to make sure that you are uploading content on a regular basis.

1070
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,000
Try to be consistent with your schedule.

1071
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,160
It may not necessarily be like, oh, hey, I'm going to release on every Friday or something

1072
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:20,960
like that.

1073
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,040
It's just try to release on a regular basis.

1074
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:32,720
As far as more YouTube specific stuff, so algorithm is everything, obviously.

1075
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,680
So you have to look at search engine optimization.

1076
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:45,680
So that could be a lot of like how you phrase stuff, keywords that you put in your description,

1077
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,720
keywords that you put in tags, even though they say tags don't work.

1078
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,680
That is nonsense.

1079
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,960
Keywords that you put in your title, stuff like that.

1080
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,640
And you can get plugins, for example, for YouTube to show you what other people use.

1081
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,480
And so you just look at like, hey, people that are making some real content.

1082
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,320
What kind of tags are they using?

1083
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,960
And then you just put that stuff in there and then you start doing it.

1084
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,000
And then all of a sudden it works.

1085
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,360
But that's not necessarily important.

1086
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,640
It may get more eyes on your content, especially with YouTube.

1087
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:20,160
You have to have a good thumbnail because you want to make sure people are clicking

1088
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:20,800
on your content.

1089
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,880
But at the same time, you also want to be engaging.

1090
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:29,360
Don't come off as in your descriptions, in your content itself.

1091
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,840
You know, don't come off as like, oh, I'm just not really good at this.

1092
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,760
And I just, you know, I really suck.

1093
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:40,720
And, you know, just I'm sorry that my content so bad and all that stuff.

1094
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,760
Don't ever do that.

1095
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,720
Just make content because what you think is bad, a lot of people will think is really

1096
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,360
great.

1097
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,200
And I found that out quite a bit like where there's people like, this is amazing.

1098
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,080
I'm like, really?

1099
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,280
Is it OK?

1100
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,040
If you say so, it's wild.

1101
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,320
But yeah, it's just putting out quality content.

1102
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,600
People eventually find it.

1103
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,960
And it's all about momentum.

1104
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,760
It's just you need to be consistent.

1105
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,640
You need to make sure that you're putting out quality content.

1106
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:14,240
Eventually, things will kind of pick up speed as you start getting more subscribers and

1107
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:14,720
whatnot.

1108
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,800
And it'll eventually keep growing.

1109
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,760
But you need to have that momentum and get that momentum eventually.

1110
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,240
And don't be afraid to like kind of change up things once in a while, especially when

1111
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:30,400
I do mostly Minecraft content, you know, that revolves around survival multiplayer.

1112
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,840
That's not necessarily for everybody.

1113
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,400
So also for yourself, so you don't get burnt out, trying different things is nice, too,

1114
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,520
because if you're doing one thing all the time, you're just going to get bored with

1115
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,840
it and you may want to move to something else.

1116
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:46,800
So just do similar analogous things to what you're doing.

1117
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,320
So in this case, like a hardcore series or something like that, you may get new viewers

1118
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:50,880
from that.

1119
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:56,160
But as far as the podcast goes, obviously having a topic that something that you're

1120
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:04,400
going to want to talk about for weeks on end, having people that you want to talk to as

1121
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:10,000
well, like if you have multiple hosts and whatnot, you want to be able to have people

1122
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,280
that you gel with and they have a good rapport with that type of stuff.

1123
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,800
So and really any of the content you do, it's just going to be yourself that's coming

1124
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,200
through and people are going to watch it for you.

1125
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,480
And that's kind of how it is once you get big enough as well.

1126
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,160
It's like it doesn't matter what you do at that point, because people are coming to

1127
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,520
watch you do it.

1128
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,640
You know, they are clicking on the video because they want to see you play this game or they

1129
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,280
want to hear you talk about this topic.

1130
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:39,600
So that's really what it kind of I mean, I don't have the whole YouTube thing figured

1131
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,000
out, but we're getting close to 500 subs.

1132
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,240
We're like so close work.

1133
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,520
Loki on YouTube.

1134
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,020
Get him over.

1135
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:51,060
So so we're almost there and you know, we're having it kind of goes in the gaming week,

1136
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,660
but like you got to check out my new video.

1137
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,020
It's super awesome.

1138
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:59,460
The intro took a whole day, so it's hand animated frame by frame.

1139
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,180
So that was fun.

1140
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:05,140
But yeah, it's a lot of just experimenting with things and stuff.

1141
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,900
So it's just have fun doing it.

1142
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,180
That's really the most important.

1143
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:12,100
If you're having fun doing it and you're enthusiastic about it, if you're having fun,

1144
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,460
it's really not work.

1145
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:16,740
But I mean, it is a lot of work to put out quality content.

1146
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:17,700
Just don't overdo it.

1147
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,580
You just lose track of it, of the time you're spending on it.

1148
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,140
I think it's it's extremely stressful.

1149
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:28,580
I mean, I have nothing to dissuade anybody, but like for me, it's always like it's always

1150
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,080
a clock.

1151
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:33,540
It's always a clock because like I put something out, it's like the clock resets.

1152
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:36,980
But I always feel that clock ticking all the time.

1153
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:41,700
And so it's just like I need to get something else out and you get something else out because

1154
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,140
I need that clock to reset.

1155
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,260
And then there's never seems like a break, but I don't know, you can kind of work it,

1156
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,540
you know, maybe not feel so stressed out by that.

1157
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:56,980
But if you really want to like drive the momentum and put out more frequent content, I mean,

1158
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:59,700
that's what you're going to have to do is really push towards doing it.

1159
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:04,020
But also remember these folks that have like millions of subscribers.

1160
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,780
This is their full time job.

1161
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:11,780
If you're if you're an adult that has, you know, you already can be like, you know, a

1162
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:16,500
kid that has school or a job and a family like all that takes time.

1163
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,460
So you're not going to be able to dedicate the same amount of time.

1164
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,780
And don't worry about not being like perfect.

1165
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,020
Nobody's expecting you to be perfect.

1166
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,540
They just want you to be entertaining.

1167
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:26,040
Yeah.

1168
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,980
Viewer count is not a measure of your personal success.

1169
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,500
And you'll learn from your mistakes.

1170
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,940
Make those mistakes early and frequently so that you learn from them.

1171
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:41,380
I want to give you this comment in chat here over twitch.tv slash vog network from a new

1172
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:41,780
listener.

1173
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:42,660
Good to see you here.

1174
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:45,460
Arrington 20 in chat says for sure.

1175
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,420
Collab is always excellent for great content.

1176
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,300
Absolutely.

1177
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:52,500
I love I will go on like any podcast within reason.

1178
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,260
I want to make sure there's a legitimacy to it.

1179
01:10:54,260 --> 01:11:01,140
And you're sticking shout out to my fellow Channel 64 brother in hearing.

1180
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:02,580
OK, but great.

1181
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:08,260
OK, great example, though, through this Minecraft stuff that you've really stuck with and doing

1182
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:12,100
this YouTube, even when it felt like Loki, nobody was watching.

1183
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,220
And you've said that on the show.

1184
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:16,820
Nobody's watching my YouTube, so I don't even know why I keep talking about it.

1185
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,340
You've said something similar to that before.

1186
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,300
And now look how that's come full circle.

1187
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,580
Now you've done enough with it.

1188
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:23,540
You stuck with it.

1189
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:27,780
Now you got a crew that wants to work with you and collab on great content.

1190
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,900
And now because of that, now people are coming over here.

1191
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,660
It's all about fights.

1192
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,020
Yeah, it's synergy.

1193
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:34,580
That's great.

1194
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,260
It's all about show Arrington.

1195
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:40,980
It's all about finding people that are as enthusiastic about it as you because I've

1196
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:44,020
been with lots of different people and not knocking any of them.

1197
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:45,780
Those communities have all been great.

1198
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:46,820
They've all been great.

1199
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:53,460
It's just that, you know, I was looking for a group of people to be able to be as enthusiastic

1200
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:53,780
about it.

1201
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:58,260
And I have an unrealistic amount of enthusiasm about putting out Minecraft content.

1202
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:01,700
So I was looking for a group of people that shared that kind of enthusiasm.

1203
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:02,820
And it's hard.

1204
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,500
You can get like with different groups.

1205
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,660
And there may be a couple people that are like that.

1206
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:09,700
But so far, you know, with this group, it's everybody.

1207
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,300
Everybody has that same enthusiasm.

1208
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,620
And it's just great because you just feed off each other.

1209
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,620
It's just really organic.

1210
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:16,340
And I love that.

1211
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,380
All right, one more question.

1212
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:22,020
I know we're spending a long time on this, but we're 20 years old tonight.

1213
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,220
It's probably going to be a long show.

1214
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:23,860
Okay, here we go.

1215
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:31,140
So one more question, and that is, do you still play DDR or listen to the music?

1216
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,460
Do you still play DDR Bomani or listen to the music?

1217
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:36,660
And I got this is probably one of the biggest questions we get.

1218
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:43,220
I think it's been addressed with the recent saga drama of the YouTube and the sorry, the

1219
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:48,580
Discord challenge that YYR and Rama were going back and forth on a little bit.

1220
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:52,420
So I think this is kind of come up recently, but I will pose it here on our 20th anniversary.

1221
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:54,820
Do you still play DDR Bomani or listen to the music?

1222
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,620
Anyone who wants to go first?

1223
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:04,260
I don't as much as I don't really listen to the music too much.

1224
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,340
At least it's not in my Spotify rotation.

1225
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,940
Probably some of it is.

1226
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:15,860
But and I really should be playing more since I have a machine in the garage to do that.

1227
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:19,060
So it is something I want in your garage, though.

1228
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,780
And summer is 100 degrees, so it's like 100.

1229
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:26,980
Yeah, the garage gets up to 120 degrees, 130 degrees.

1230
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:31,940
So but you know what, though, when I was actually good about exercising on a regular basis and

1231
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:36,660
doing that diet and exercise stuff like I didn't let the 100 degree heat bother me.

1232
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:40,820
I would just roll up the garage door and just do it, just bear with it.

1233
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:43,780
But yeah, I haven't done it for a while.

1234
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:48,820
I played like a few weeks ago, but I really need to go back and do it more.

1235
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:58,980
Um, my answer would be I smile whenever I hear a DDR song from like Max 2 and before

1236
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:02,740
Nah, Xtreme and before, because I heard the cartoon hero Speedy Mix the other day and

1237
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:03,460
I did smile.

1238
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:09,940
I still smile when I hear those songs, because I think about a time past, you know, and meeting

1239
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:12,420
my friends and good memories at the arcade.

1240
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:15,540
I can't say I actively play DDR anymore.

1241
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:23,460
I think a lot of that, a lot of that probably has to do with just access and availability

1242
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:28,180
of a DDR machine and partially my unwillingness to get up in front of like the teenagers that

1243
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:28,820
are playing it today.

1244
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,860
Today's my 44th birthday, okay?

1245
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:37,940
There comes a certain shyness about wanting to play the game around all these young kiddos

1246
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:44,500
anymore these days, but once that new place opens up, I can go over there while school's

1247
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,060
in session.

1248
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,540
Yeah, that's what I'm waiting for.

1249
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:51,860
I want that to open up so I can play Dance Rush because I've been looking at that and

1250
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:52,500
that looks fun.

1251
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:58,660
So, uh, looking at chat, Savilas says, fuck, you're old.

1252
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,380
Yeah, I know.

1253
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:00,580
Pop Culture says 44.

1254
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,220
Rob is like, yeah, screw all of you.

1255
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:07,140
But I also have taken the mantle of Twitch's drunk auntie.

1256
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,140
I love that.

1257
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:11,460
Well, Dark Soccer, what's your answer to the question?

1258
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,620
Do you still play DDR or listen to the music?

1259
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:22,340
I cannot play DDR like I used to, um, just because of, of, I have arthritis in my hip,

1260
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:30,180
I'll admit, you know, I can't do it, but I, you know, if I see a BeatMania machine out

1261
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,940
in the wild, I'll stop and play it.

1262
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:35,940
I do, uh, you know, when we were going to California Extreme, I would, I would play.

1263
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:42,260
And I mean, in, in my streaming music, my background music that I play during my, my

1264
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:49,220
live streams, I've got like a lot of Taku in there, like stoic and, uh, a few other

1265
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:49,780
things.

1266
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:58,500
Um, I have some, uh, other, you know, songs that have been turned into Bemani songs, like

1267
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,740
Cat's Eye, you know?

1268
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:07,300
Um, but I also was a fan of, of, you know, those original TV shows, you know, that they're

1269
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:07,940
theme songs.

1270
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:15,700
Um, I, uh, and, you know, there's some things that we were fans of before they got into

1271
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:20,740
DDR that I'll still listen to, like, you know, sandstorm sometimes I'll, I'll feel like wanting

1272
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:23,380
to listen to the old, the old things.

1273
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:29,700
Um, you know, I'll even catch myself humming something even when I haven't even listened

1274
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,180
to it.

1275
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:34,660
Like I was trying to clean up the other day and I was actually humming three, two, one

1276
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:40,100
stars and I was chasing the cat around and it was hilarious.

1277
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:40,260
Yeah.

1278
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:44,100
I actually do have Captain Jack in my playlist rotation right now.

1279
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:50,820
I have in the army, I have some erotic in my playlist that I play on stream.

1280
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:54,180
Um, uh, like, especially the ABBA stuff.

1281
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:58,180
Do that ABBA album is fire in there too.

1282
01:16:58,980 --> 01:16:59,860
Um, oh yeah.

1283
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,860
And erotic is actually still putting out, uh, they have like, I think an album, a couple

1284
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:07,300
of, uh, weeks ago, smile DK.

1285
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:07,940
Yeah.

1286
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:11,780
Um, which I remember, I remember, okay.

1287
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,420
Story time.

1288
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,780
Anime expo 2000.

1289
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:21,140
I w it was my Jill Valentine cosplay.

1290
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:32,020
They had a DDR third mix and people like were doing the code to play, uh, uh, flat mode.

1291
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:36,580
They could play it like second mix, remember, um, or putting in the code for vivid.

1292
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:41,940
And I remember hearing the, the, uh, smile D was it this?

1293
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,220
No, it wasn't smell DK.

1294
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:47,300
It was the Olivia project with Xanadu.

1295
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:49,940
And again, thank you for this.

1296
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:55,140
Funara Xanadu is one of my favorite movies and I was singing along with it and then just

1297
01:17:55,140 --> 01:18:02,740
realized this is coming from DDR and promptly had to play Xanadu in combat boots that had

1298
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:06,900
not been broken in for me and full Jill Valentine cosplay.

1299
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:16,580
And now who's in, who's in dead by daylight, Jill, and I play Claire, but my feet were

1300
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,220
also super torn up after that.

1301
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:20,580
That was, it was great.

1302
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:31,620
Um, and, uh, and I remembered being better prepared to play DDR because I had second

1303
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:36,660
mix for dreamcast with those slippery ass dance pads that wanted to break my neck.

1304
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:41,380
And I remember Julie bought another dance pad so that she could play it.

1305
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:44,660
Well, Julie has a habit of buying stuff and then never reclaiming it.

1306
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:45,460
So now it's mine.

1307
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:48,500
And I learned how to do doubles at home.

1308
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:58,020
And I, I just remember, you know, that, that it was, I still, I still am in love with the

1309
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:58,420
music.

1310
01:18:58,420 --> 01:18:59,780
I mean, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1311
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,420
Oh, I just knocked Evie over.

1312
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:03,620
I just knocked Psyduck over.

1313
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:05,540
This thing.

1314
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:06,820
Oh yeah.

1315
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:07,460
Those things.

1316
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:11,860
I think those, they're cute, but I think they're kind of, they're kind of crap, but they're

1317
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:12,260
cute.

1318
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:13,540
It's not, it's a novelty.

1319
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,420
It's a novelty.

1320
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:14,900
Yeah.

1321
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,020
And now I need to figure it out.

1322
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,020
Oh, but I'm sorry for the podcast listeners.

1323
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,460
She held up the little, um, toy.

1324
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:23,380
We have to remember that there's a little toy DDR machine thing that she held up, uh,

1325
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:25,140
that you've probably seen at target recently.

1326
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:25,780
And then.

1327
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:26,900
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1328
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:27,140
All right.

1329
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:33,540
But anyway, but, but going back to the point on it is that every so often I want to hear

1330
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,340
the old stuff.

1331
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:41,380
And I want to remember, I have a lot of visual memory attached to sound as well.

1332
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:49,460
And so when I have that, when I hear something, it brings back a visual memory with it, including

1333
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:54,820
the one night I stayed for four hours until I could beat paranoia.

1334
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,140
Spite goes a long way.

1335
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:00,420
It goes a long way.

1336
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,300
It's a theme today.

1337
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:01,860
All right.

1338
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:06,340
Those were the five most commonly asked questions we get over the last 20 years.

1339
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:07,540
Thank you.

1340
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:09,860
Um, for, for indulging us with that.

1341
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,900
Gosh, that took us a lot of time for our kickoff topic, but that's all right.

1342
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,260
It's a special show tonight.

1343
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:17,940
Um, there was actually another question that came in that I thought was very interesting.

1344
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:18,340
So sure.

1345
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:19,300
I'll add one more.

1346
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:24,020
I just don't have a fancy, um, logo or slide for it, which many people are saying nice

1347
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,060
PowerPoint.

1348
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:25,620
Excuse me.

1349
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:26,900
It's open office.

1350
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:27,540
Thank you very much.

1351
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:30,260
This is a keynote household.

1352
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,220
So, uh, let's see here.

1353
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,340
Where was the question?

1354
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,980
Um, and again, I just, I really can't stress this enough.

1355
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,740
Thank you for the generosity tonight.

1356
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:42,900
We are doing a podcast, so we don't really stop and read them all live.

1357
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:46,020
I will acknowledge everybody at the end and we're probably going to have a 10 minute

1358
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:46,980
editing tonight.

1359
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,100
Um, but thank you so much.

1360
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:48,820
I really appreciate it.

1361
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:49,060
Okay.

1362
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:52,100
Here's the question, um, that came in earlier that I thought was pretty good.

1363
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:55,860
And I want to entertain this and then we'll move on to, um, our gaming weeks and headlines.

1364
01:20:56,420 --> 01:21:04,020
Um, pod culture asked, what's the best and the worst criticism you guys have received

1365
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:07,380
over the years, the best and the worst criticism.

1366
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:10,340
I have a feeling, I know where your brain is going, Jamie, and I'll let you go first

1367
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:13,220
because for me, it's the easy answer is the worst.

1368
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:23,140
But if you shit, whoever that was, that I, that I need to stop talking about video games

1369
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:24,500
and go back to the kitchen.

1370
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,020
Number one, fuck wad.

1371
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:34,180
I probably was playing video games longer than you were alive, even back then.

1372
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:38,100
And number two, fuck your misogyny.

1373
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,980
You know, you don't want me to make a sandwich.

1374
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,260
I'll put razorblades in it.

1375
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:49,380
You can eat that shit and then shit out razorblades and intestines and all kinds of crap.

1376
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,260
I don't care.

1377
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:54,020
That's, that's the easy answer is what's the worst criticism.

1378
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:57,780
And I, even if that criticism wasn't directed at me, I would still, I would have still said

1379
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,300
the same type of answer.

1380
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:02,340
Well, and I've actually, I'll say this.

1381
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:09,620
I've had an email that's, or I, not me, wasn't me personally, or was it the mail bag?

1382
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:10,580
You might have to remind me, Jamie.

1383
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:11,860
This was a long time ago.

1384
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:16,900
Somebody wrote into the show that they enjoyed listening to our banter and they enjoyed

1385
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:22,740
listening to us talk about the news and stuff and our viewpoints, but that they were praying

1386
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:31,060
for me because of my lifestyle as a gay man who I don't think I was with Alan at the time

1387
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:31,460
yet.

1388
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:33,060
So I think this was before that.

1389
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:37,220
I think this would have been, I mean, most of these weird ass emails came in around the

1390
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,460
time podcasting launched in, in Apple.

1391
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:43,060
Cause that's when Jamie got her sandwich email and that's, that's when this one came in around

1392
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:43,700
that same time.

1393
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:50,580
And so it was just very, like, I, I don't know, like, you know, I could get on a whole

1394
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:56,820
soapbox and go, it's not on pride month, not today, but I think you all know where my brain

1395
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:57,620
is going with this.

1396
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:58,820
It's just one of those.

1397
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:05,220
I don't know what this individual thought would be accomplished from an email like that,

1398
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:09,940
other than a backhanded compliment, which is really what it is, is that.

1399
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,340
They'll have this shit going on today.

1400
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:12,660
Yeah.

1401
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:15,940
I like your news and I like your witty things.

1402
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:19,700
I just don't like your, I just don't like your life.

1403
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:25,300
And it's like, how do you think I got being gay as part of who I am?

1404
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:31,140
You know, I'm not, I like to think I'm not a one note and I'm just gay, this gay, that

1405
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:34,580
I'm not like, um, Jack from will and grace.

1406
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:34,900
Okay.

1407
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:39,060
I'm not that I have a more, I'm not a 30 minute sitcom gay.

1408
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:39,860
I have a life.

1409
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:43,060
I do all these things, but it is a part of who I am.

1410
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:49,220
And I wouldn't have the witty banter with Loki and dark soccer or the insight to the

1411
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:50,100
news and all that.

1412
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:53,860
I wouldn't have that if I wasn't gay and I didn't choose to be gay.

1413
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:58,420
Let me tell you with all the shit that happened in high school and some of the things I've

1414
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:01,780
gotten, do you think I would choose to get emails like that?

1415
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:03,220
I didn't fucking choose that.

1416
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,620
Anyway, but you know what?

1417
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:08,660
Here's what I wonder.

1418
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:14,420
I wonder in 2022, you know, we've been on the air 20 years is a long time.

1419
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:24,260
And while I bring that up, we have seen gay marriage be legal, then repealed by prop eight,

1420
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,500
then repealed again.

1421
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:31,140
So the gay marriage is legal again, down to justice Thomas's comment.

1422
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,620
This last week, we already talked about that stuff at the top of the show.

1423
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:39,140
I'm not going to go back down to that slope, but we've seen that whole process go through.

1424
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,020
And in the last 20 years, I have seen minds change.

1425
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,060
And I wonder if that person is still out there.

1426
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:48,180
And I wonder if they would write that same email today.

1427
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:54,260
And I hope in my heart, maybe they've had an epiphany and maybe they regret writing

1428
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:54,660
that.

1429
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:57,300
In which case, I forgive you if you're out there.

1430
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,060
Uh, yeah.

1431
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:07,700
Oh, yes.

1432
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:09,140
Yes, Marissa.

1433
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,140
Nothing wrong with Jack level gay either.

1434
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,500
Absolutely not.

1435
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:16,580
But I was more trying to comment on in a 30 minute sitcom.

1436
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:19,060
It's all you get to see of his personality.

1437
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:23,460
I hope that element of my comment isn't lost or what have you.

1438
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:25,300
Okay.

1439
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,340
And let's see.

1440
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:30,900
So what about the best criticism that we've gotten over the years?

1441
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,260
I don't know.

1442
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,500
This is a tricky one.

1443
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:38,180
I did.

1444
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:40,820
This is more coming from a discussion.

1445
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:49,380
A discussion that I had back with Meg Z back in the day about the power of impact versus

1446
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:49,940
intent.

1447
01:25:52,100 --> 01:26:00,500
And you can intend on a certain thing with what you say, but it's the impact of what

1448
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,100
you say that's going to go further.

1449
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:10,980
And when we who are in this position where, yes, there are people who listen to us and

1450
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:16,580
I would even go out on a limb and say that we do have a degree of influence out there

1451
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:22,180
just for people who trust our opinions and like what we have to say, that you also have

1452
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:29,780
a responsibility then to look at what you say and kind of judge the impact that it might

1453
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:30,100
have.

1454
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:43,140
Like, you know, if I were to go out and say, well, I think this person needs to do this

1455
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:45,620
differently because blah, blah, blah.

1456
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:51,060
And then it will come out, oh, well, she thinks that all of this is a thing and that everyone

1457
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:51,940
should stop doing it.

1458
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:54,740
People are going to take it out of proportion as well.

1459
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:57,140
That's something else to also keep in mind.

1460
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:03,380
But the thing is, is to look at the impact of the words that you say.

1461
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,460
Does that make sense?

1462
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:06,260
Absolutely.

1463
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:07,060
I think that's huge.

1464
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:09,700
It reminds me of that quote.

1465
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,220
I believe it's a Maya Angelou quote.

1466
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:15,540
I'm going to butcher it, but it's that whole people won't remember what you say, but they'll

1467
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:17,220
remember how you made them feel.

1468
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:18,980
And it's very that to me.

1469
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:20,500
Yeah, yeah.

1470
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:27,860
Oh, and I mean, also to quote Eddie Izzard too, you know, it's not what you say, but

1471
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:28,820
how you say it.

1472
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:31,300
Oh, God, yes, God, yes.

1473
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:36,260
But I mean, like, okay, I actually, I actually know what one of the examples was.

1474
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:40,100
It's this whole, you know, when, when people were complaining about the ending of Supernatural

1475
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:49,060
and about the episode, there's an episode where there were Castiel confesses his love

1476
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:49,540
for Dean.

1477
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:52,980
And then everyone's like, oh, it's the ship is real, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1478
01:27:52,980 --> 01:28:00,500
And I'm like, but you can, you know, I was actually pointing out that it's also okay

1479
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:08,020
to accept that while one man may have a romantic feeling, it's also okay for someone to not

1480
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:10,420
reciprocate it the same way, you know?

1481
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:15,460
And I was like, I know that you're excited about your ship and I am happy.

1482
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,260
If that's the way that you interpret it, then good.

1483
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,180
We need more of that in the world.

1484
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:26,020
I am fully behind you, but I also want to make sure that for those of us, you know,

1485
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:33,700
that for people who are ace like myself, that it's also fine to understand that, that two

1486
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,980
men can love each other platonically.

1487
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:41,700
It can even be a degree of romanticism and not want to go fuck people, you know?

1488
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:46,340
And it was in that discussion that people were like, oh, homophobia, blah, blah, blah.

1489
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:47,940
I'm like, do you know who I am?

1490
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:54,020
First of all, and then second of all, I was like, you're not even paying attention to

1491
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:59,140
it, but that's the thing that you have to think about exactly lining out word by word,

1492
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:04,980
the way you are going to state your opinion so that it won't be taken out of context and

1493
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,660
have an unintended effect.

1494
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:15,940
I'm trying to think of the best piece of advice and I'm kind of torn between either

1495
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:19,620
the person that, and I don't even remember who said this, but the person that said,

1496
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:25,460
you know, one of these days, nobody's going to be playing DDR anymore and you have to,

1497
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,740
then what's your show going to be about?

1498
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:30,820
And that sort of allowed us to, and I'm not knocking, I know many of you are still very

1499
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:35,780
passionate about the game and so forth, but I think getting away from just talking about

1500
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:40,740
DDR music games was huge for this show and so important in what it is now that I'm very

1501
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,420
thankful somebody spoke up and said that.

1502
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:46,980
The other best piece of advice would probably be, you know, I was saying earlier that if

1503
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:51,220
you go back to a lot of those old OLR episodes, there's probably things that we would have

1504
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:57,060
said, like, you know, I mentioned Project Runway inserted the phrase hot blank mess

1505
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,540
into our vernacular that is inappropriate today.

1506
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:05,540
Or like, was it like some of the match game stuff where we just try to think of the most

1507
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:13,380
most inappropriate, uh, it basically, I mean, it was kind of, we played it like, um, cards

1508
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:16,980
against humanity, basically stay the most inappropriate things we could think of.

1509
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:20,500
Not that we'd actually think that, but it's just like, we're trying to find the most

1510
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:22,820
shocker.

1511
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:23,460
Yeah.

1512
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:28,260
Whereas now it's like, nah, it doesn't really seem appropriate to do any of that.

1513
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:33,540
Well, and on top of that, the truth came out about the cards against humanity company,

1514
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:38,420
how their office was a toxic workplace and how they abuse their employees.

1515
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:45,380
So I remember we used to sit around playing that, that particular game all the time and

1516
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:51,540
just how hurtful a lot of the things on there were that, you know, you couldn't do that.

1517
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:52,040
Yeah.

1518
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:58,260
So I, I appreciate, and my point with that is I appreciate those that have corrected

1519
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,340
me from a place of love.

1520
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,980
So, um, and concern.

1521
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:04,260
So thank you.

1522
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,740
And I would say that's the best feedback, honestly.

1523
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,140
Um, Loki, do you have anything you want to add to that?

1524
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,740
Uh, I know we've talked a lot again.

1525
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:13,620
Now I have one more question that I've got to do, but you know what?

1526
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,580
I don't, if we do questions all night and don't even get to the fucking news, I don't

1527
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:16,900
care.

1528
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:19,860
So let's just do more questions.

1529
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:22,100
I didn't really have anything to add to that, unfortunately.

1530
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:22,580
All right.

1531
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:22,820
Okay.

1532
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:23,540
That's fine.

1533
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:25,540
Uh, let me get to this other question here.

1534
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:28,740
Um, because I thought this was, this was good, uh, from Tay.

1535
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:32,740
And I'm not sure if you were here earlier, Tay, and a big shout out to Tay plays games.

1536
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,660
Who is in the last year?

1537
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:39,460
And I've been on Twitch for like 10 years since it was just in TV.

1538
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:44,020
I haven't taken it seriously since probably VOG came over to Twitch and all that.

1539
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:48,660
But my point is just in the past year, I've learned a lot from Tay.

1540
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:56,260
Just like really good ideas and like, just like the knowledge share that he's shared

1541
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:56,820
with his audience.

1542
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:57,780
So just big shout out.

1543
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:02,580
And, you know, I think he's great and, um, uh, give him a follow, but I want to get to

1544
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:02,980
this question.

1545
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:05,860
I don't know if you were here earlier because we answered a similar question, but there's

1546
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:09,460
a, there's a unique component of this that I think makes this worth answering.

1547
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:13,940
And so Tay says, I have two questions for Rob, Jamie and Loki.

1548
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:19,460
What do you think is the single best thing to happen to gaming culture in the last 20

1549
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:19,860
years?

1550
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:26,100
What do you think is the single worst thing to happen to gaming culture in the last 20

1551
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:26,420
years?

1552
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:32,900
So the best and the worst, um, of culture.

1553
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:37,780
And I think that's, it's not about like gaming stories or news, like we talked about earlier,

1554
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:38,740
but gaming culture.

1555
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:43,940
And for me, again, I hate to start with the worst, but I like the answer is just like,

1556
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:46,260
oh, easy, uh, gamer gate.

1557
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:50,420
What it is, what a piece of trash that whole thing was.

1558
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:58,820
I mean, just, and it's weird because in a way I would almost say Twitter was also some

1559
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:07,700
of the best because Twitter gave us like that direct access to game creators for better

1560
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:08,660
and for worse.

1561
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:14,980
And believe me, there's a lot of worse as was exhibited by gamer gate, but there's been

1562
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:16,900
a lot of wholesome moments as well.

1563
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:23,460
Um, such as when that president cat thing happened and we were all tweeting that Japanese

1564
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:28,260
developer and some, some poor social media answer, uh, intern or whatever on a Monday

1565
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:33,380
morning over in Japan is literally tweeting back going, I'm not sure why so many people

1566
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:36,100
in America are tweeting us, but thank you for the love.

1567
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:40,180
And we hope to hope to have our game there someday or something like that.

1568
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:44,340
It was just so there was a meeting in an office somewhere because of us.

1569
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:47,460
Yes, there was a, there was definitely a boardroom meeting somewhere because of us,

1570
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:51,380
but I loved that, that.

1571
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:54,900
And to me, that was a, that was a great part of gamer culture.

1572
01:33:54,900 --> 01:34:01,300
So I would say, I would say Twitter and that social media has brought us both extremes.

1573
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,380
It's been the best and it's been the worst.

1574
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:04,020
I'm sorry.

1575
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:05,140
What would you want to elaborate?

1576
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:10,820
Um, I can actually add in one of the really bad things about it.

1577
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:12,580
And that's, Oh my God, JV Mon.

1578
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:13,640
Hi.

1579
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:15,300
Sorry.

1580
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:18,900
I had to, cause I know there's a lot of old faces tonight, Ella and new ones too.

1581
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:25,220
Um, but I'm going to go back and to elaborate a little bit on that one, as far as the really

1582
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:36,340
dark underside, as I'm going to go to in cell culture and the attacks on, on female presenting

1583
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,100
people in gaming.

1584
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:46,340
And mind you, we now exceed the overall population of gamers in general.

1585
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:53,220
Um, it's, uh, I'm trying to go back to it.

1586
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:59,220
It's these little angry boys on the internet.

1587
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:00,260
I'm just going to say it that way.

1588
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:05,700
Who for some reason, they, they can't get a date.

1589
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:16,740
They, they can't, you know, they feel ignored or, you know, the, for whatever reason goes

1590
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:23,700
on is they think then that this gives them the right to use the anonymity of the internet

1591
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:27,060
to harass, uh, you know, women in chat.

1592
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:34,420
You, you remember I got bullied off of Twitch before for a bunch of misogynist pieces of

1593
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:37,220
shit that just kept pushing at me and wouldn't stop.

1594
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:42,180
And I was fucking playing a pigeon dating game, you know?

1595
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:53,780
And, and basically it's, it's really disgusting and really sad because these are the same

1596
01:35:53,780 --> 01:36:00,980
people that are now going out and shooting up schools and malls and attacking populations

1597
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:08,580
of people because of their own inadequacies, their own sense of inadequacies, not feeling

1598
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:10,500
supported.

1599
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:15,940
And, and there is, there's, you know, that ties back into a bigger social aspect of it,

1600
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:21,460
but that was originally going to be where I was going with this.

1601
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:26,180
And I mean, there's lots of positives to the advent of podcasting itself has opened

1602
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:28,820
up very large education channels.

1603
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,340
That's a damn good answer.

1604
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:37,140
Like just, just like streaming culture in general and the fact that we all have more

1605
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:37,620
voices.

1606
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:40,740
I mean, it, but again, there's a dark side to that.

1607
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:45,860
We all know that, but I would like to say because we can all choose how to curate that

1608
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:46,340
experience.

1609
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:48,100
There's been more good than bad for me.

1610
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:48,820
Well, you know what?

1611
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:50,980
One of my favorite movies is Pump Up the Volume.

1612
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:52,580
Oh yes.

1613
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:58,020
And I keep thinking of the end of that movie where after they arrest Christian Slater's

1614
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:00,660
character and what was her name?

1615
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:06,980
I want to say Martha Plimpton, but that wasn't her that played the Eat Me, Beat Me lady.

1616
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:09,380
I don't know.

1617
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:10,580
It's been so long.

1618
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:12,820
Yeah, but the two of them get arrested at the end.

1619
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:16,500
And then after that, you know, again, this is like the mid nineties.

1620
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:22,340
People start busting out shortwave radio sets and trying to say, Hey, I have things to say.

1621
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,380
I have things to say.

1622
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,660
Pirate radio, basically.

1623
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:35,380
And now we are legally able to go out and broadcast the things that we have to say to

1624
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,420
whoever the fuck wants to listen to it.

1625
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:39,380
Right?

1626
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:42,180
And you know what?

1627
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:47,860
I don't have to be this docile little flower of femininity.

1628
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:52,020
I can be a loud and obnoxious bitch if I feel like it.

1629
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:54,820
I can speak my mind.

1630
01:37:54,820 --> 01:38:01,300
I don't have to adhere to whatever cultural norm you think should apply to me just because

1631
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:02,500
I possess the uterus.

1632
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,460
And it's freedom.

1633
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:08,660
It's so freeing that we have this outlet.

1634
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:14,980
And, and I'm pretty careful about, you know, keeping people from knowing where I live,

1635
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:16,980
although, uh, Grandpa is where I live.

1636
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:25,220
But, uh, you know, I try to maintain that I've had, you know, my, my stage name forever.

1637
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:31,700
Rob and I have both had to deal with, with stalkers, you know, again, internet culture.

1638
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:32,580
Oh yeah.

1639
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:33,780
I forgot about that.

1640
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:34,900
Yeah.

1641
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:43,380
But I think right now for me personally, I'm thinking that the pros of having this voice,

1642
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:50,100
and also I'm going to say another positive in this whole thing is being in my forties.

1643
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:54,500
I give fewer shits, number one.

1644
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,220
Cheers to that.

1645
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:59,860
Behold the field in which I grow my fucks and lay thine eyes upon it and see that it is

1646
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:04,340
buried, but also I have perspective.

1647
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:08,740
I've grown up with a controller in my hand.

1648
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:11,540
I grew up playing pinball.

1649
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:15,300
I still cannot play Frogger well, unless I'm in roller skates.

1650
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:22,500
And on top of that, the fact that we're staying with both the old and the new, we are continuing

1651
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:26,180
to grow with it and have the perspective to see where it all came from.

1652
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:33,540
That right then and there, I'm going to say that us old ass gamers are a positive.

1653
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:38,900
We are one of the best phenomenons that's happened to gaming.

1654
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:40,580
I love that.

1655
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:43,140
Loki, I don't know.

1656
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:45,940
I don't know if you want to follow that, but do you have anything that jumps out for best

1657
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:47,060
and worst in gaming culture?

1658
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:51,300
Yeah, so I I'll just go a different direction, I guess.

1659
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:54,340
Um, so for worst, it would have to be swatting.

1660
01:39:55,300 --> 01:40:01,780
Oh, that's so good call because because people I mean, you can kind of tie it back with the

1661
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:04,980
whole, you know, culture of like in selling all that stuff.

1662
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:08,340
But like, yes, swatting where, you know, people can actually die.

1663
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,860
So that's that's bad, obviously.

1664
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:15,860
The best stuff I would probably have to go with, like YouTube and like Twitch, like the

1665
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:19,460
streaming, you know, getting exposed to a lot of different people, different unique

1666
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:25,540
things, you know, different ways to play games, different ways to experience stuff, you know,

1667
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:31,460
even going back to like the beginning, you know, with machinima, there's, you know,

1668
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:35,060
let's play series, there's all these different personalities that came out of it.

1669
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:42,020
There's even the extent where we're going beyond like Twitch with, you know, user interaction,

1670
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:43,220
Twitch plays stuff.

1671
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:49,380
More recent, I like watching, for example, Doug Doug, who will incorporate his chat with

1672
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,180
different things.

1673
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:51,380
And that's hilarious.

1674
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:59,940
So a lot of that stuff, I think, is really kind of elevated gaming, especially the way

1675
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:06,180
we experience as like an entertainment form, you know, beyond what we've had in the last

1676
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:06,740
20 years.

1677
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:09,700
I excellent.

1678
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:12,820
I just wanted to add to that, Jamie.

1679
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:15,220
It's well said.

1680
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:15,860
Yeah, well said.

1681
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:19,700
Okay, we're getting some more questions in chat.

1682
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:20,180
You know what?

1683
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:21,780
I'm about to make an executive decision.

1684
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:23,300
I think we're just gonna say screw the news tonight.

1685
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,460
Can I say one thing?

1686
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:28,660
Yeah, we can do like, like, if you have a headline you really want to do, we can still

1687
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:28,900
do it.

1688
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:31,220
But yeah, Stadia ain't dead, bitches.

1689
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:38,660
They're expanding their servers to allow some Intel graphics servers.

1690
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:40,820
And they're hiring.

1691
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:41,540
You know what I'll do?

1692
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:42,020
I will.

1693
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:46,820
I will literally run through the news and we can spend 15 seconds on each headline, but

1694
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:47,700
I'll do that at the end.

1695
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:50,180
Okay, but I still want to do classic game and some of our staples.

1696
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:52,340
Hey, she is not in denial about Stadia.

1697
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:53,780
I can show you the links.

1698
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:54,180
All right.

1699
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:55,540
I've got the receipts.

1700
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:56,040
All right.

1701
01:41:57,460 --> 01:42:00,260
Let me get because you guys have some great questions here.

1702
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:01,700
So I want to get to these.

1703
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:04,260
I'm trying to like copy paste these to a thing.

1704
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:06,980
So we were talking about segments and so forth.

1705
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:09,620
Shehole10 had a really good question here.

1706
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:13,540
And that is, why did you get rid of the FUs of the week?

1707
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:17,860
And not everybody may know, but we used to have a segment on the show and it was capped

1708
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:21,220
off by playing the song One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.

1709
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:26,500
I think we had some different songs throughout the years, but that was the legendary song.

1710
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:30,740
And we used to rant about whatever was going on.

1711
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:36,100
And we actually had, do you remember in the earlier days of OLR, in the Bamani days, we

1712
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,260
had Explicit was his name, Jonas.

1713
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:43,060
And when he was here for the FUs of the week, he would go on and on for like five, six,

1714
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:43,700
seven minutes.

1715
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:44,340
Love Jonas.

1716
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:44,500
Yeah.

1717
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:45,460
I adore that guy.

1718
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:49,860
He does a lot of stuff with gaming rooms, anime conventions, or at least he did.

1719
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:51,140
I don't know if he still does, but yeah.

1720
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:52,340
I think he was still a part of that.

1721
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:52,820
Yeah.

1722
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:53,320
Yeah.

1723
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:58,180
So it's great to see folks moving on and up and doing these things.

1724
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:00,660
But why did we get rid of the FUs of the week?

1725
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:05,300
And well, Jamie, it was a segment you had kind of started and I also saw you answer

1726
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:06,500
this a little bit in chat.

1727
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,500
You want to start with this and I'll follow up on it.

1728
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:09,300
That's our secret.

1729
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:10,260
We're always angry.

1730
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:15,380
No, we just wanted to, I mean, especially since it was toward the end of the show, we

1731
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:19,860
wanted to have a little bit more positivity, I think, but I don't know.

1732
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:22,980
We've been sort of at the start of our show.

1733
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:26,500
I mean, especially with recent things, we have been taking a go off on it.

1734
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:27,940
So maybe it's time to revive it.

1735
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:33,300
I, for me and the FUs of the week, like I think that's what it is, is that, you know,

1736
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:37,700
we just said earlier in the show, like the advice that we have is be enthusiastic, be

1737
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:38,180
positive.

1738
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:42,980
And it was always weird to kind of talk about the news, but then stop and we're going to

1739
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:44,100
rant about things.

1740
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:47,300
And I kind of felt like we were becoming that thing with that.

1741
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:53,140
Like even if it wasn't really that, it was allowing it to become that thing that I don't

1742
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:54,580
like in other podcasts.

1743
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:55,700
And so I was like, why are we doing this?

1744
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:59,060
We're like stopping the show to do these rants when we don't even have things that we're

1745
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:00,020
usually ranty about.

1746
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:05,460
I understand that it is humorous to play one winged angel when we talk about these kinds

1747
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:11,220
of things, but I don't think that juxtaposition was required in every episode from here on

1748
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:11,380
out.

1749
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:15,300
I think if we did FUs again, we need to have happy music playing in the background, like

1750
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:16,900
the Ohaska or something.

1751
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:22,340
And I would argue in the first 20 minutes of tonight's show, we did a giant FU of the

1752
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:22,820
week.

1753
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:29,140
We just didn't call it the FUs of the week, but She-Hulk and all of our listeners, that

1754
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:30,900
was an FU of the week for sure.

1755
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:39,700
So that's why that segment kind of got retired, but it still lives on an ad hoc basis as needed,

1756
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:41,540
as you saw tonight, for sure.

1757
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:44,100
Let's see.

1758
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:49,220
And it's also like, we have Twitter now, so it's like, we don't have to wait for the

1759
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:51,700
episode to come out to complain about something.

1760
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:54,900
And honestly, there's so much to complain about every week.

1761
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,420
It's just, I don't know.

1762
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:58,340
I think people just don't want to hear it.

1763
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:00,660
It may be entertaining, but we can be entertaining in other ways.

1764
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:09,460
Sorry, my keyboard is so clacky that when I have my mic hot, you can hear it.

1765
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:11,220
So I have to turn my mic on and off.

1766
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:15,940
So it's interesting because chat is going back and forth a little bit about Stadia.

1767
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:21,220
And I thought this comment from Tay is a lot of where my mind is at, is that I think cloud

1768
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:24,980
gaming in general is a huge achievement that's still in its infancy.

1769
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:27,620
I'm really excited to see what it looks like in five years.

1770
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:31,700
And that was in reply to a comment that Pod Culture said that was, there is an argument

1771
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:34,740
to be made that Stadia is a huge gaming moment in the past 20 years.

1772
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:37,220
Yes, to both those things.

1773
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:42,980
And I would say that when we're looking back at gaming in 30 years, I mean, who knows if

1774
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:48,980
OLR is around at 30 years, but if we're looking back on 30 years of gaming, I think cloud

1775
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:50,740
gaming will be at that moment.

1776
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:55,940
Maybe, like I said earlier in the show, I think Xbox Live was huge.

1777
01:45:55,940 --> 01:46:00,740
I think we have to see where cloud gaming goes and what the derivatives of that end

1778
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:01,060
up being.

1779
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:02,260
And I think we're seeing a little bit of that.

1780
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:08,580
I'm not just talking about straight up copycats like Luna, but also a little bit of what Xbox

1781
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:15,300
Live is doing and how they are not just having the streaming that is either on your computer,

1782
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:20,740
it's on the phone, you have access to wherever, but also the fact that they're leveraging

1783
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:26,740
the cloud processing and all of that in more traditional types of games.

1784
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:31,300
And I suppose Nintendo, believe it or not, to an extent, does this too by even being

1785
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:35,140
able to deliver a game like Control on the Nintendo Switch in the first place.

1786
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:41,540
So I do think we're still seeing the early days of cloud gaming, but we need more people

1787
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:49,140
to get rid of bandwidth caps, such as Xfinity's infamous bandwidth cap.

1788
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:50,740
Oh, it can't because they have monopolies.

1789
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:54,980
So, yeah, more companies are going to have to be pressured to get rid of those before

1790
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:56,340
cloud gaming can really take off.

1791
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:58,740
Now, you all know I have a new provider now.

1792
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:02,340
I have an uncapped provider and it's marvelous.

1793
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:09,300
And I even told my former provider who was Xfinity, I said, this is the reason why I

1794
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:09,620
left.

1795
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:11,140
They don't have a cap.

1796
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:11,460
You do.

1797
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:17,220
You would think with it, you know, as GPI being gone, that we would be getting some

1798
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:18,420
momentum on that front.

1799
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:20,260
But like, it's nothing.

1800
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:21,460
No, it's a bummer.

1801
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:26,260
OK, let's get to some more questions.

1802
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:28,980
And if you haven't, what's that?

1803
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:29,540
I have cake.

1804
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:31,460
Yes, you do.

1805
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:33,220
How come you got cake for our birthday?

1806
01:47:35,540 --> 01:47:41,060
Because I told a certain spouse of mine that I really wanted tiramisu.

1807
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:46,180
A spouse offered to go to said grocery store and find me tiramisu and brought me a tiramisu

1808
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:46,980
cake.

1809
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:47,700
Oh, that's nice.

1810
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:52,340
I'm like, it's my actual birthday today, too.

1811
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:53,940
I want freaking cake.

1812
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:55,300
But actually, I'm diabetic.

1813
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:56,260
I don't want cake.

1814
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:59,780
My husband did give me birthday Chipotle, so I'm very happy for that.

1815
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:00,820
So I will.

1816
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:01,220
I will.

1817
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:03,460
I will take your burrito and there you go.

1818
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:04,820
Cake Chipotle.

1819
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:08,100
I like this one, too.

1820
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:08,980
So let's go to this.

1821
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:14,420
I like all the questions, but let's go to this question from Mike Deft, who asks, what's

1822
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:22,660
OLR's proudest moment, the episode or moment you would show to anyone who doesn't know

1823
01:48:22,660 --> 01:48:23,940
anything about the show?

1824
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:30,980
What is OLR's proudest moment, the episode or moment you would show to anyone who doesn't

1825
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:32,020
know anything about the show?

1826
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:34,900
Proud of when you came out on the show, Rob.

1827
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:37,620
That's right.

1828
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:39,380
I forgot that I did.

1829
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:42,580
You know, and this kind of ties back to something I was talking about earlier.

1830
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:48,180
Those first couple of years of OLR, I did make a choice where I was like, you know what?

1831
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:52,260
I don't want to just be the show's token gay, so I'm not really going to talk about it on

1832
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:52,980
the show.

1833
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:56,980
And I wasn't necessarily trying to stay closeted.

1834
01:48:56,980 --> 01:48:59,780
I was just saying, I don't want to talk about it.

1835
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:02,740
So this subject is not something that I want coming up on the show.

1836
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:03,540
And that was that.

1837
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:10,180
But there was, I don't remember the moment that changed my mind.

1838
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:16,660
But I think I had a fuck it moment, as sometimes is ought to happen, where you just say, fuck

1839
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:16,820
it.

1840
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:17,540
I'm going to do it.

1841
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:21,700
And I did.

1842
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:23,220
And I certainly don't regret it.

1843
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:29,300
I will say some of the best reward I've had from doing OLR and going back to the best

1844
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:29,780
feedback.

1845
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:35,300
You know, I talked about a difficult email I got earlier, but I've also gotten emails

1846
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:37,140
from three different people.

1847
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:44,260
And I remember them all over the years that have said, hearing you on OLR and talk about

1848
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:51,300
your life and how you live out gay and all that stuff, it's helped me accept a lot of

1849
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:51,700
things.

1850
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:57,460
Sorry, I said I'm not going to do it tonight.

1851
01:49:58,340 --> 01:50:03,460
It's helped me accept a lot of things about who I am.

1852
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:11,460
And I'm not sure there's been, although I certainly don't like seeing people go through

1853
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:12,900
that sort of struggle.

1854
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:13,540
I've been there.

1855
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:14,180
I've done that.

1856
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:15,780
I empathize with that.

1857
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:22,340
I'm not sure there has been a greater reward in the years of me doing this show than those

1858
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:22,820
emails.

1859
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:28,420
End of thought.

1860
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:28,900
End of thought.

1861
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:38,660
So thank you, Jamie, for remembering that because I actually forgot.

1862
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:39,140
You're right.

1863
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:40,820
In the beginning, I wasn't out.

1864
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:41,700
I forgot about that.

1865
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:46,820
I mean, it wasn't hard to figure out, but I wasn't out.

1866
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:51,220
I didn't have a word for what my deal was at the time.

1867
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:53,460
A lot's changed over the years.

1868
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:54,420
Yeah.

1869
01:50:55,140 --> 01:51:02,580
Um, well, since I don't get fan emails, sorry, I don't have anything to add to it.

1870
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:07,540
But no, I would say like the best moment, I don't really have a moment that would show

1871
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:13,940
somebody, but like it would be like the early shows when we shared an apartment and it was

1872
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:15,940
just like everybody gathered there.

1873
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:20,660
I think those would probably be some moments I would show to people.

1874
01:51:20,660 --> 01:51:25,060
Now, the shows were obviously low tech at the time, so it probably wouldn't translate

1875
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:25,460
very well.

1876
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:30,580
But those were like peak fun, basically, because you had everybody have that party atmosphere

1877
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:32,020
like the entire time and stuff.

1878
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:34,100
So that was fun for sure.

1879
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:38,340
We so like, you know, I know a lot of people joke about Episode 69.

1880
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:41,540
And considering tonight, we're on Episode 920.

1881
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:43,220
So this was a very long time ago.

1882
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:45,860
Episode number 69 was pretty fucking funny.

1883
01:51:45,860 --> 01:51:50,420
And there's a reason why that show is legendary, because it is that it was at Loki's.

1884
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:51,700
And I's apartment.

1885
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:58,740
Sadly, Dark Sakura wasn't there, but her presence was felt the drunk show that the way Yeah,

1886
01:51:58,740 --> 01:52:01,060
there were other shows like it too.

1887
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:01,940
And the fuck show.

1888
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:04,980
We tried to be we tried to be PG.

1889
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:12,580
I remember being drunk off my ass with a microphone in my hand doing this show, kicking the wall,

1890
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:13,940
yelling, I'm in the matrix.

1891
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:14,900
I'm in the matrix.

1892
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:21,860
I don't know if I'm member being drunk in the back room and eating up all of Loki's

1893
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:22,420
waffles.

1894
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:26,340
I don't know if I'm necessarily proud of those shows.

1895
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:31,380
But at the same time, I recognize they were pretty fucking funny.

1896
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:39,380
And a moment in time, if you will, like, those are not like if somebody was like, why should

1897
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:40,500
I listen to orange on radio?

1898
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,340
I'm not going to show them the drunk episode.

1899
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:48,020
I'm probably more proud of the episodes where we have had an impact on the real world and

1900
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:52,340
maybe taken a stand for things we believe in, such as, like, you know, what we started

1901
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:54,980
off the show with tonight, not to toot the horn too much.

1902
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:57,620
But I think some of those moments have been huge.

1903
01:52:57,620 --> 01:53:03,060
I think some of the ways we have been personally affected in our lives.

1904
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:09,620
I think that first pandemic episode where Jamie may or may not have had COVID and we

1905
01:53:10,180 --> 01:53:13,140
were talking about pneumonia.

1906
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:19,620
Yeah, we were talking about Death Stranding remotely and talking about some of how that

1907
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:24,020
is felt, you know, with the weird way the world is like some of those, like, real life

1908
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:24,500
things.

1909
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:29,140
I remember the episode the night that Obama went on the news and said they killed Bin

1910
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:29,700
Laden.

1911
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:31,860
That all happened while we were on OLR.

1912
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:32,420
Yeah.

1913
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:38,500
Yeah, it's things like that where, like, the real world kind of seeped in and we as gamers

1914
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:41,220
and our family and our culture kind of got to react to that.

1915
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:47,140
I think those were some of the moments that I thought were, like, these were real moments

1916
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:48,420
for sure.

1917
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:56,740
And I would say, honestly, on a completely different note, another, like, best moment,

1918
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:59,380
E3 2004 to 2006.

1919
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:07,940
And I know I give the ESA and E3 a lot of shit now in 2022, but damn, let Grandpa tell

1920
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:11,220
you a story about when E3 was awesome.

1921
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:19,540
And when we got to go and, you know, we were kids that grew up reading about E3 and Nintendo

1922
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:21,700
Power and other magazines like that.

1923
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:24,740
And because of this show, we got to go.

1924
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:26,580
That was pretty awesome.

1925
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:31,700
My favorite picture of us was from E3 in 2005.

1926
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:32,200
Yeah.

1927
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:36,340
Going to E3 and hanging out in the Konami booth was fun.

1928
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:43,220
And, like, honestly, like, taking a step back, how special and unreal was that?

1929
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:49,220
That, like, we were doing a show about DDR and Bamani and Konami, back when they were

1930
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:52,660
cool, knew about it and noticed us.

1931
01:54:53,540 --> 01:55:01,940
Or that was the press event that they had in San Francisco and they unveiled DDR Super

1932
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:06,260
Nova and I got to play DDR Super Nova before everybody else.

1933
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:13,460
Loki was the first person in the US outside of Konami to play DDR Super Nova.

1934
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:14,900
He was.

1935
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:15,700
I was there.

1936
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:20,820
What about us being able to do the Silent Hill stuff for DDR?

1937
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:21,460
Yeah.

1938
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:22,500
Oh, the track.

1939
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:25,700
Yeah, because our friends started working there, which was wild.

1940
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:31,860
And then not just that, but do you remember from DDR Hawaii when they were still around

1941
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:35,700
and rest in peace still wind because he was a huge part of this and he passed away several

1942
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:37,780
years ago and you probably knew that.

1943
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:44,340
But he knew of this show, found this show, and thanks to him, we got to debut songs from

1944
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:44,740
DDR.

1945
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:49,540
We basically announced the song list for DDR Ultra Mix 4 before anybody else.

1946
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:51,940
And that was because of that.

1947
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:54,900
And you all helping the show to be successful.

1948
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:55,460
I mean, it's just.

1949
01:55:56,180 --> 01:55:57,060
Holy shit.

1950
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:57,560
Wow.

1951
01:55:58,420 --> 01:55:59,300
Didn't we have, like.

1952
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:04,100
We didn't do, like, Max 2 remixes or anything like that, or was there something with the

1953
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:04,500
remix?

1954
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:04,980
I don't remember.

1955
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:05,860
Maybe that's Ultra Mix.

1956
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:06,500
I'm thinking of.

1957
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:08,820
What?

1958
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:09,860
Elaborate.

1959
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:10,260
What do you mean?

1960
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:16,100
I thought there was, like, songs that we played on our show that were it wasn't like Max 2

1961
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:16,900
remixes or anything.

1962
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:17,780
It was Ultra Mix 4.

1963
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:21,460
It's the same thing that I was just talking about, basically.

1964
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:24,740
Yeah, the Max 300 remix for Xbox, says JVMon.

1965
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:25,220
Right.

1966
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:28,180
And JVMon also says the Xbox DDR games are so great.

1967
01:56:28,180 --> 01:56:29,220
They really were.

1968
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:32,260
They were like, DDR Hawaii did such good shit.

1969
01:56:32,260 --> 01:56:37,700
And it's just we need to take a moment to really appreciate what was unappreciated by

1970
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:38,580
most at the time.

1971
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:42,260
And that is the DDR Xbox games, because they were all so good.

1972
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:44,820
And I'm not just saying that because we had friends that worked on them.

1973
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:47,300
But yeah, it's just amazing.

1974
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:49,540
So let's see.

1975
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:53,060
I thought I feel like I missed a question somewhere along the way.

1976
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:55,460
If I didn't get to your question, will you please post it?

1977
01:56:55,460 --> 01:56:59,460
Just because there's so many of you in chat tonight, and I'm so thankful.

1978
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:02,180
Hugs, but I'm having a hard time keeping up on chat.

1979
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:05,700
But we did get another question that came in down here towards the recent stuff.

1980
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:06,900
So let me get to this.

1981
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:14,340
So Tay said, if we're keeping this AMA open, I do have another question.

1982
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:14,900
Sure.

1983
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:15,860
You know what we already said?

1984
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:17,940
We're gonna say fuck the news tonight and just do your questions.

1985
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:22,020
I'd love to know more about the logistics of the show.

1986
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:26,420
Do you all chat about the show topics the night before?

1987
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:27,860
30 minutes before?

1988
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:30,420
Is there a shared Google Doc about topics?

1989
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:31,860
Who picks the topics?

1990
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:33,780
Who does the editing and recording?

1991
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:36,020
Who uploads stuff to podcast services?

1992
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:37,460
Who does social media?

1993
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:39,540
Is there one person or do you split it?

1994
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:41,140
Feel free to answer any of those.

1995
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:45,460
Okay, so there's a lot of components there.

1996
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:49,380
So let me just explain what goes through an average OLR episode.

1997
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:52,020
So I kind of gave away earlier in the show.

1998
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:57,220
There's a secret forum that is the reason why forums still exist on VOG Network.

1999
01:57:57,220 --> 01:58:00,980
And on that forum, people will post stories throughout the week.

2000
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:03,460
And that is meant to be kind of like a sticky board.

2001
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:05,460
So like a Google Doc type of thing.

2002
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:07,380
So Loki will post his stories.

2003
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:09,300
Dark Tetsuya posts things.

2004
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:12,340
VX Jason, our voiceover guy, shout out to Jason.

2005
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:15,220
Couldn't have made it 20 years without you in many, many ways.

2006
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:18,580
And Bobby sometimes will chime in with the topic as well.

2007
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:23,460
I don't really post stuff there because I'll explain why in a minute, but they'll all post

2008
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:24,180
things there.

2009
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:29,460
Dark soccer emails it to me because for some reason, her computer doesn't like the old

2010
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:30,580
forum software, to be fair.

2011
01:58:30,580 --> 01:58:32,340
It's probably a compatibility issue with the old forum software.

2012
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:34,740
Like it keeps you setting my password for some stupid reason.

2013
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:41,940
Well, I found that my new system kept trying to block it through the AT&T firewall and

2014
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:44,900
I had to like set VOG Network as an exception to get around it.

2015
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:46,660
So it's just, there's some dated tech.

2016
01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:48,580
That's the problem with running a 20 year old show.

2017
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:49,700
It's dated tech.

2018
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:58,180
But anyway, so I will then compile all of that into one show role that I basically use

2019
01:58:58,180 --> 01:59:02,500
OpenOffice Excel to put together every week.

2020
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:03,460
And you know what?

2021
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:05,620
Since you all asked, why not?

2022
01:59:06,740 --> 01:59:09,300
Let's be completely transparent.

2023
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:09,860
There you go.

2024
01:59:09,860 --> 01:59:11,540
That's what an average show looks like.

2025
01:59:11,540 --> 01:59:12,980
And that's the one for tonight.

2026
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:15,620
And it shows you everything we're going to be talking about tonight.

2027
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:17,300
That we were supposed to be talking about.

2028
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:20,740
Yeah, so that's why I'm showing this one, because we're not going to get around to

2029
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:23,220
these topics, but this is what we would have been talking about tonight.

2030
01:59:23,220 --> 01:59:26,820
I also know it's very tiny because, let me see, I'll just do a control scroll.

2031
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:28,500
So there you can see what it actually looks like there.

2032
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:31,940
So you can just see like, that's everything.

2033
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:36,500
So I compiled this into that Excel kind of template that we've used.

2034
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:38,980
We've used this template over 10 years.

2035
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:40,820
It used to be a Word doc.

2036
01:59:40,820 --> 01:59:43,460
And then at some point it sort of switched to this thing.

2037
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:45,380
So it's just, you know, once in a while we changed that.

2038
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:46,260
Wrong shot.

2039
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:48,420
Let's see.

2040
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:50,820
I'm forgetting components of that question.

2041
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:51,300
So then what?

2042
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:56,340
Then, so no, we don't really meet beforehand because we kind of know, like the show roll

2043
01:59:56,340 --> 01:59:58,580
kind of lays out who's going to talk about what.

2044
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:03,620
But we all also, we have a relationship over the past 20 years where we just know.

2045
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:07,060
We might step on each other's toes a little bit and you just have to roll with it.

2046
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:08,100
It's live radio.

2047
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:09,620
That's what we signed up to do.

2048
02:00:09,620 --> 02:00:11,220
There is no second takes.

2049
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:13,140
Well, there can be.

2050
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:15,060
If I fuck up the intro, there'll be a second take.

2051
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:17,220
We've had the do over on occasion.

2052
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:23,140
But there's very rare second takes, you know, of like actual content in the show.

2053
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:25,540
And usually it's because of tech issues or whatever.

2054
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:27,220
That sort of thing.

2055
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:30,980
So that is kind of how the show all comes together.

2056
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:36,980
Now I am the one pushing the streaming button and all of that stuff because remember Tay,

2057
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:42,580
and you may not know this because I think we've only met during the pandemic, but pre-pandemic

2058
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:44,580
we did this show in person.

2059
02:00:44,580 --> 02:00:51,780
So Jamie and Loki came over to my house and for a little while it was at Jamie's house.

2060
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:54,260
I would say in the, what era was that?

2061
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:59,300
It was probably the Shermy era, probably around 2009 to 2012 or something like that.

2062
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:04,100
It was at Jamie's house, but there was like, Rob had a computer because I just kind of

2063
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:07,060
knew I, at this point, I just knew how to do it.

2064
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:09,780
And like, Jamie could back me up if she had to.

2065
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:10,660
And she did one night.

2066
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:13,940
Like I remember Tiara hosted one night and I wasn't here and they took over the show

2067
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:14,440
for a night.

2068
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:20,500
But like most of the time, you know, I was doing it and that was, you know, it's whatever.

2069
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:23,540
It's just what happened over 20 years is I just learned how to produce.

2070
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:28,420
So I'm still doing that to this day, basically, even in the virtual environment that we're

2071
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:28,920
in now.

2072
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:31,300
And Tay says, oh, I didn't realize that.

2073
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:35,460
Yeah, so it was a little, so even the show role and all that stuff, that was the exact

2074
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:37,140
same way when we were in person.

2075
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:38,660
So that's how that was done.

2076
02:01:38,660 --> 02:01:44,820
And then as far as uploading and putting it on the feed, I do it, but it's not as intensive

2077
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:47,300
as you think it is because all I do.

2078
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:54,660
So while this is broadcasting to Twitch, I am also recording a localized movie file of

2079
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:55,220
this.

2080
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:57,380
My solid state drives allow me to do this.

2081
02:01:57,380 --> 02:02:02,820
After the show, I will open up the movie file in my audition from like the year 2006 that

2082
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:05,380
still works and is what I edit the show on.

2083
02:02:05,380 --> 02:02:11,940
And I will crop the show, meaning I'm cutting out the like, you know, the cat video and

2084
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:14,660
the things that you see on Twitch, you know, it's here in the podcast.

2085
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:18,660
And then at the very end, the part after, OK, we're done, let's wrap it up, you know,

2086
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:20,500
that that so it's just the show.

2087
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:28,740
And then I post that MP3, the website everything is running on was built is really maintained

2088
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:30,420
by Jason, our voiceover guy.

2089
02:02:31,140 --> 02:02:35,460
If not for Jason, there would not be a place to put this show.

2090
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:39,300
And that's why I say Jason helps this show in many ways you don't even hear.

2091
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:42,580
And we're incredibly thankful for that.

2092
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:47,060
And the actual website that's like Joomla, which is really old, but Deep Man did that

2093
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:48,020
a long time ago.

2094
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:54,340
I completely realize the website is showing its age, but I also argue is a website as

2095
02:02:54,340 --> 02:03:00,660
important these days as a Twitter, as a Twitch, as our Twitch channels got to be more good

2096
02:03:00,660 --> 02:03:04,980
looking than a website at this point, because you all subscribe in iTunes and probably don't

2097
02:03:04,980 --> 02:03:05,860
visit the website.

2098
02:03:05,860 --> 02:03:06,980
It's that so.

2099
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:10,260
God, did I hit all the questions?

2100
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:12,580
There were a lot of questions there, which is great.

2101
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:15,300
I'm totally fine giving you a peek behind the curtain there.

2102
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:18,260
Who uploads stuff to pocket?

2103
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:19,460
Who does social media?

2104
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:27,380
Mostly me on Twitter, although Facebook, we don't really use that very often, but we've

2105
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:28,740
all been known to kind of hop on that.

2106
02:03:29,380 --> 02:03:30,900
Facebook is garbage anyway.

2107
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:33,780
Yeah, I don't use it so much anymore.

2108
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:39,460
Social media, and that is probably the blind spot that I wish we got more involved with

2109
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:44,340
and we probably need to, and especially try to keep up with the newer trends like TikTok.

2110
02:03:44,980 --> 02:03:48,500
I don't fucking know how to clip this show for TikTok.

2111
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:50,420
And that's where I might need a little help.

2112
02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:52,180
Just play it really, really, really, really fast.

2113
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:54,980
I can handle that.

2114
02:03:54,980 --> 02:03:56,340
I mean, that part's not hard.

2115
02:03:56,340 --> 02:03:59,220
It's what I do with my stream when I remember to.

2116
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:04,020
Okay, let's see.

2117
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:06,340
Some more questions.

2118
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:08,980
I'm trying to load my queue here so I don't forget anything.

2119
02:04:08,980 --> 02:04:14,980
Okay, let's go to Pod Culture who asks,

2120
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:19,940
you guys mentioned the best games in the past 20 years.

2121
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:24,340
What's the worst or most disappointing?

2122
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:27,060
And I think that opens the door to some very different answers.

2123
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:28,980
WCW Thunder.

2124
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:34,820
That was so bad that Dan and I returned it to the store, to the blockbuster video.

2125
02:04:38,740 --> 02:04:40,020
Loki, worst game?

2126
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:45,220
I'm trying to think most disappointing.

2127
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:48,020
I know there's going to be something and I can't think of it.

2128
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:51,700
And then as soon as I think of something, it's going to, I'm going to remember what it is.

2129
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:59,860
Gosh, I don't know.

2130
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:02,100
I mean, I don't know.

2131
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:03,300
Give it a couple months.

2132
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:06,180
I would say, okay, no, no, no.

2133
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:11,780
Most disappointing, I think for me would be Saints Row four.

2134
02:05:12,820 --> 02:05:14,180
That's most disappointing for me.

2135
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:17,460
Possibly the new Saints Row game when it comes out.

2136
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:18,740
Although that looks pretty good.

2137
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:19,620
I mean, it looks okay.

2138
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:23,060
I mean, I kind of just ignore the characters right now, but.

2139
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:28,020
Yeah, Saints Row four, I think was pretty disappointing.

2140
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:30,900
I know there's other things that are more disappointing that

2141
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:33,380
I'm probably just not thinking of right now.

2142
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:41,940
If I use my DDR Bahmani roots as a little bit of a crutch here, but I think it's a real

2143
02:05:41,940 --> 02:05:42,660
good answer.

2144
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:48,340
I would say beat and groovy on the Xbox 360, because that was what we got to represent

2145
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:51,940
the very popular Japanese arcade series, pop and music.

2146
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:53,860
And boy, did they fuck it up.

2147
02:05:53,860 --> 02:05:55,780
Boy, did they fuck up that game.

2148
02:05:55,780 --> 02:06:02,020
And that could have been like the launch of a new music franchise on Xbox arcade.

2149
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:03,780
And they could have done such a good job with it.

2150
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:07,460
But what they gave us felt half baked and incomplete.

2151
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:08,260
It was terrible.

2152
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:11,220
It was embarrassing as a Bahmani fan.

2153
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:11,460
Yeah.

2154
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:13,460
Dark Two Seas says that game had nine songs.

2155
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:15,460
Beat and groovy was embarrassing.

2156
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:21,940
So I think just as somebody who, you know, who star on this show is because of music

2157
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:23,460
games and that sort of thing.

2158
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:25,060
That game fucking sucked.

2159
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:26,340
And that was, yeah.

2160
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:26,900
Orange Wright says-

2161
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:27,540
A disappointment.

2162
02:06:27,540 --> 02:06:27,780
Yeah.

2163
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:31,380
Orange Wright says beat and groovy felt like a game they released just to protect a patent.

2164
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:32,500
Absolutely.

2165
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:37,380
I'm trying to think if I have a more shocking answer, like a big budget game or something

2166
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:39,540
that I bought and I just really didn't like.

2167
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:44,260
But honestly, I don't know if anything was more disappointing than that, to be quite

2168
02:06:44,260 --> 02:06:44,660
honest.

2169
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:46,340
I'm really trying to struggle to think.

2170
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:49,460
And I'm not sure I'm coming up with something.

2171
02:06:49,460 --> 02:06:50,100
I'm trying to think.

2172
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:54,500
I feel like there's been like a remake or something that really pissed me off.

2173
02:06:56,420 --> 02:06:58,020
But I'm coming up short in the moment.

2174
02:06:58,580 --> 02:06:59,540
No, I'm good.

2175
02:06:59,540 --> 02:07:00,100
Good.

2176
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:00,660
Good call.

2177
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:03,300
Pod Culture, No Man's Sky version one.

2178
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:05,700
I didn't hate it as much as everyone else did.

2179
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:11,700
I don't love it as much as I love it now, but I also didn't buy into a lot of that pre-game

2180
02:07:11,700 --> 02:07:12,020
hype.

2181
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:15,700
Oh, Orange Wright.

2182
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:16,100
Yes.

2183
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:19,060
Original Final Fantasy 14.

2184
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:20,020
What a turd.

2185
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:24,740
What a turd of a game that was just, just bad.

2186
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:28,340
Tay says Spore was a fucking massive disappointment.

2187
02:07:29,540 --> 02:07:34,020
I actually don't know if I hated it as much as everyone else did, but you know what?

2188
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:39,700
Going back to the earlier question about best moments and because of Orange's radio and

2189
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:40,660
everything that's been done here.

2190
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:45,860
I got to it E3 2005, maybe 2006.

2191
02:07:45,860 --> 02:07:54,180
I got to sit in a room, a small room, and watch Will Wright, the man himself, play Spore.

2192
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:56,660
And walk us through that game.

2193
02:07:56,660 --> 02:08:01,380
And maybe it's because of that memory and the fact I have that sentimental kind of thing

2194
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:06,660
to it that I forgive that game a lot more than most people.

2195
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:09,620
And that was a moment to get to see him.

2196
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:14,020
And it's like, wait, this is the great game maker, Will Wright, actually playing this

2197
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:15,460
in front of me right now.

2198
02:08:15,460 --> 02:08:16,340
This is incredible.

2199
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:20,340
At that same E3, I heard it.

2200
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:22,660
Now I didn't see this one, but I heard that was the one.

2201
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:28,740
And as famous as where Robin Williams showed up and he did one of the Spore walkthroughs

2202
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:31,140
and it was apparently pretty legendary.

2203
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:36,420
And, you know, again, one of the latest, late greatest people anywhere.

2204
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:40,260
You know, that was that's just kind of it built a lot of hype for that game, for sure.

2205
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:41,460
But yeah.

2206
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:43,380
OK.

2207
02:08:46,740 --> 02:08:49,780
Pixel Pacas asks a very good question here.

2208
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:52,820
And I must say, last call for questions.

2209
02:08:52,820 --> 02:08:56,260
Last call, if you have one or two more, we'll get those and then we'll do some of our other

2210
02:08:56,260 --> 02:08:57,140
segments.

2211
02:08:57,140 --> 02:09:04,980
Pixel Pacas in chat says, Where did you go to find information about how to start broadcasting

2212
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:06,820
OLR online to begin with?

2213
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:13,140
Today, it's easy to find how to guides or YouTube videos, but I'll assume that level

2214
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:14,820
of help didn't exist at the time.

2215
02:09:15,940 --> 02:09:17,780
That's a great fucking question.

2216
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:20,820
And I'm really having to tap my memory bank.

2217
02:09:21,860 --> 02:09:29,060
So I remember originally reading about podcasting on a Web forum, and I don't remember which

2218
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:36,260
forum, I'm sorry to say, but I remember reading it described as TiVo, but for the radio.

2219
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:37,780
And that's how I heard it described.

2220
02:09:37,780 --> 02:09:44,020
And that's when I said we need to fucking get on that because, you know, we were at

2221
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:48,260
that point with doing Orange Lounge Radio where I was like, man, we're really like,

2222
02:09:48,260 --> 02:09:51,540
I feel like more people are listening to us, but man, I really wish I knew how we could

2223
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:52,420
just like even push.

2224
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:57,140
And then when I thought somebody could just download the show and listen to it whenever

2225
02:09:57,140 --> 02:09:58,100
they want.

2226
02:09:58,100 --> 02:09:58,820
Oh, fuck.

2227
02:09:58,820 --> 02:09:59,620
That's that's it.

2228
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:02,420
That's what we got to do, because I've had so many people tell me I'd love to listen

2229
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:04,260
to OLR, but I'm busy Sunday nights.

2230
02:10:04,260 --> 02:10:05,540
I do this other thing Sunday nights.

2231
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:07,940
So I said we need to get on that.

2232
02:10:07,940 --> 02:10:08,740
Absolutely.

2233
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:13,060
But then I also realized, oh, and some of you know this about the old OLR.

2234
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:15,780
And if you go to the archives, you'll see this, the old live show.

2235
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:17,380
We played music breaks.

2236
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:20,260
We played DDR music and dance meetings during the breaks.

2237
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:27,060
So I was like, copyright isn't going to let us put that out on a podcast and let us

2238
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:27,860
download it.

2239
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:30,180
We're going to have to do a separate show.

2240
02:10:31,140 --> 02:10:32,740
What could we do a separate show about?

2241
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:34,980
OK, OK, so there's music games.

2242
02:10:34,980 --> 02:10:39,860
What if we did a separate show about all the games, all video games?

2243
02:10:39,860 --> 02:10:45,620
And that's where the first 20 minutes to go edition came from, was us doing other headlines

2244
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:47,700
and not playing copyrighted music.

2245
02:10:47,700 --> 02:10:53,060
And yeah, there was a while when we would do a three hour with music Orange Launch Radio

2246
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:59,700
and then 20 minutes to go afterwards and then 30 minutes and then 40 minutes and then 60

2247
02:10:59,700 --> 02:11:00,500
minutes.

2248
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:07,460
And now it's we're spending four hours, sometimes more here doing all of this.

2249
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:11,780
And it's like fucking 1030 before I have to drive home.

2250
02:11:12,580 --> 02:11:15,140
I meaning dark soccer, Logie, whatever.

2251
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:16,340
And do you know what?

2252
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:18,020
And so it was like, oh shit.

2253
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:24,420
And then somewhere in the middle of that, Apple launched podcasts and there was a brief

2254
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:29,700
amount of time where there were thousands of people listening to this show every week.

2255
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:30,500
Thousands.

2256
02:11:31,380 --> 02:11:34,820
And there were 45 that were here live.

2257
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:37,140
We love the live audience.

2258
02:11:37,620 --> 02:11:38,980
We love you all.

2259
02:11:38,980 --> 02:11:40,100
You guys turn it out.

2260
02:11:40,740 --> 02:11:45,700
But surely you have to understand the perspective, the sudden conundrum we were faced with is

2261
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:49,380
that your spinoff show is now popular than your main show.

2262
02:11:49,700 --> 02:11:50,740
How do you fix this?

2263
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:58,900
And so we reinvented the main show to remove the music breaks and basically become an elongated

2264
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:00,020
to go edition.

2265
02:12:00,580 --> 02:12:05,780
But with some of our segments, like classic game of the week, I'm not sure it started

2266
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:06,180
at that point.

2267
02:12:06,180 --> 02:12:08,740
It might have still been like your website of the week or one of those segments that

2268
02:12:08,740 --> 02:12:09,780
came before it.

2269
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:15,220
But I remember doing website of the week and then the Weebill and Bob folks messaged us.

2270
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:17,540
Oh, my God.

2271
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:18,660
That's right.

2272
02:12:18,660 --> 02:12:20,100
Oh, that was wild.

2273
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:21,380
That is.

2274
02:12:21,380 --> 02:12:21,860
Yeah.

2275
02:12:21,860 --> 02:12:23,860
So yeah, I just have to stop.

2276
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:26,980
I just saw Didi Archaholic in chat.

2277
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:28,180
Oh, my God.

2278
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:29,140
Blast from the past.

2279
02:12:29,140 --> 02:12:30,580
I am so happy to see you.

2280
02:12:30,580 --> 02:12:33,380
It's so nice to hear and see you guys again.

2281
02:12:33,380 --> 02:12:34,900
The seeing part is amazing.

2282
02:12:34,900 --> 02:12:37,540
Now you guys have come so far, isn't it?

2283
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:37,940
Isn't it?

2284
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:39,860
Technology is wild, my friend.

2285
02:12:39,860 --> 02:12:40,820
It's so good to see you.

2286
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:43,620
Yes, I will stop this entire fucking show just to say hi to you.

2287
02:12:43,620 --> 02:12:43,940
All right.

2288
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:51,460
So anyway, gosh, where was I?

2289
02:12:52,660 --> 02:12:53,380
I don't know.

2290
02:12:53,380 --> 02:12:56,740
My whole excitement for seeing Didi Archaholic totally derailed where my brain was with that

2291
02:12:56,740 --> 02:12:57,140
question.

2292
02:12:57,140 --> 02:12:59,460
But oh, yeah, the question was about how to guides.

2293
02:13:00,820 --> 02:13:04,420
So I don't remember.

2294
02:13:04,420 --> 02:13:08,900
I remember trying to figure out how to get to the podcast.

2295
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:12,500
I had to download a thing called Lemon Pod, I think was the first because it wasn't an

2296
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:12,900
iTunes yet.

2297
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:15,700
So I had to learn about how that all worked.

2298
02:13:16,420 --> 02:13:17,460
I want to say.

2299
02:13:20,340 --> 02:13:25,780
Jason, somebody behind the scenes kind of was like audio RSS.

2300
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:27,140
I think I know how to do that.

2301
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:29,140
I don't think that doesn't seem too hard because that's all it is.

2302
02:13:29,140 --> 02:13:32,100
It's like RSS, like a blog, but it's attached audio file.

2303
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:33,380
I think I know how to set that up.

2304
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:35,300
And that was it.

2305
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:36,980
So I did have a lot of help.

2306
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:44,020
So on the back end, because Jason built the podcast script that is still in use today.

2307
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:48,660
Might I point out that was built for the original Orange Songs Radio To Go edition.

2308
02:13:48,660 --> 02:13:50,500
Episode one is still in use today.

2309
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:52,180
And Jason built that.

2310
02:13:52,180 --> 02:13:53,780
I didn't do anything with the tech with that.

2311
02:13:53,780 --> 02:13:56,580
So I guess I had a little help PixelPakas.

2312
02:13:57,300 --> 02:14:03,300
It's nice to have friends and community that help you with that sort of thing.

2313
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:08,580
We're always thankful for that.

2314
02:14:08,580 --> 02:14:09,220
That's for sure.

2315
02:14:11,380 --> 02:14:12,020
Okay.

2316
02:14:12,020 --> 02:14:15,060
I don't know if any other questions came in, but I'm looking through chat.

2317
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:16,500
Drew Nami showed up.

2318
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:18,100
Oh, talk about blast in the past.

2319
02:14:18,100 --> 02:14:18,500
It's so.

2320
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:21,060
I'm like, you better get your ass in here.

2321
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:24,580
This is better than going to your high school reunion, which I never went to any of mine,

2322
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:27,220
but this is even better than that.

2323
02:14:29,700 --> 02:14:35,860
I feel like I missed a question somewhere along the way that said something about the

2324
02:14:35,860 --> 02:14:37,380
next 20 years.

2325
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:39,620
And like, what was it?

2326
02:14:39,620 --> 02:14:43,300
I might've missed it, but something about the next 20 years and I'm sad I missed it.

2327
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:50,260
But honestly, my original reaction to that question was I'm not sure this goes another

2328
02:14:50,260 --> 02:15:01,060
20 years, and I don't want to sound defeatist or whatever, but keep in mind another 20 years,

2329
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:07,220
we're going to be 64, 65.

2330
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:17,540
I think we kind of have to accept that there's going to come a time when it's time to say

2331
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:28,100
we did a great thing here, and now we're going to hang up the mantle and let others carry the torch.

2332
02:15:28,100 --> 02:15:36,020
I know Dark Sakura's joked about Loki's kids doing it or Julian or whoever out there.

2333
02:15:37,220 --> 02:15:42,420
It's kind of funny because I know there are podcasts out there about the DDR scene today,

2334
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:45,620
and I know they don't know who the fuck we are, and that's okay.

2335
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:50,980
I still see it a little bit as passing the torch, if that makes sense.

2336
02:15:50,980 --> 02:15:54,340
So it's like when you start to see that next generation come up and you kind of go,

2337
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:56,340
yeah, the kids are going to be all right.

2338
02:15:57,060 --> 02:16:04,580
I think is when you start to say maybe it's okay to start to wind it down.

2339
02:16:05,780 --> 02:16:12,580
So I just kind of, but at the same time, I've been saying that since episode 100.

2340
02:16:15,620 --> 02:16:18,660
So we'll see.

2341
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:25,460
Yeah, now people are saying OLR in the multiverse and all that stuff.

2342
02:16:26,740 --> 02:16:31,060
JVMON, oh my God, so good to see you, says, nah, OLR till the 50th anniversary.

2343
02:16:31,700 --> 02:16:36,580
TayPlaysGame says, in 20 years we will be rebranding to AARP radio.

2344
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:38,900
DarkTosia says, OLR the next generation.

2345
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:41,380
Or PodCulture says, strange new worlds.

2346
02:16:41,380 --> 02:16:44,020
Yeah, a whole universe.

2347
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:50,340
Well, I mean, if you think about universe, OLR was a spinoff show.

2348
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:54,500
I'm not going to hide or be embarrassed because I'm not.

2349
02:16:54,500 --> 02:17:00,340
I'm proud of the fact that this show is a spinoff of sorts, of Travis Donovan's

2350
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:06,740
Understandation Live, and Travis Donovan was the man that taught me any idiot can podcast.

2351
02:17:09,620 --> 02:17:12,180
And I'm so thankful to him for it.

2352
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:17,220
And this show, I'm well aware, and I'm thankful, has spun off other shows.

2353
02:17:17,220 --> 02:17:22,660
Rama's been very upfront and saying anime jam session is a big part of, you know,

2354
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:26,260
it's spinoff from what we do here at Orange Launch Radio and all that good stuff.

2355
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:29,380
And all of that.

2356
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:35,940
So it's funny because we, but there is kind of an OLR universe already that we fit into.

2357
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:39,700
So yeah, go ahead.

2358
02:17:40,340 --> 02:17:49,140
I would also like to point out that 60 isn't really that old anymore, being in your 60s.

2359
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:50,500
No, I know.

2360
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:55,780
And who knows, maybe OLR won't be around, but maybe we'll still be podcasting.

2361
02:17:56,340 --> 02:17:57,300
Exactly.

2362
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:57,860
Exactly.

2363
02:17:59,860 --> 02:18:03,460
And some other comments in chat here.

2364
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:05,780
Where is Travis, says Rama.

2365
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:08,580
Ultimately, and I'm not trying to say this in a shady or whatever way,

2366
02:18:09,540 --> 02:18:10,420
you'll have to ask him.

2367
02:18:11,060 --> 02:18:17,620
But Travis did retire from this biz, and he's probably hanging with the wife and kids.

2368
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:18,260
And that's OK.

2369
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:24,260
You know, so that's what he's, you know, I can still say I'm so thankful that, you know,

2370
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:28,100
he helped show us how to set up a studio and things like that.

2371
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:29,940
I knew the audio components I would need.

2372
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:36,660
I knew what needed to be there to be going into a live 365 station.

2373
02:18:36,660 --> 02:18:39,220
But ultimately, you're going to have to ask him.

2374
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:44,260
He may not even honestly, because this happens to also be my actual birthday.

2375
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:49,300
Nothing I'm posting on Facebook is going to get through today.

2376
02:18:49,300 --> 02:18:52,660
So Travis may not even realize it was tonight, to be quite honest.

2377
02:18:52,660 --> 02:18:53,220
And that's OK.

2378
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:55,860
He doesn't have to circle it on his calendar or whatever.

2379
02:18:56,500 --> 02:19:00,580
So let's see.

2380
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:02,340
JV Mon says, where's Shane?

2381
02:19:02,340 --> 02:19:03,140
Text him.

2382
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:04,580
If he's here, he lurks.

2383
02:19:05,140 --> 02:19:11,620
But I will say, holy shit, Shane and I had a hilarious stream on Friday night, I think

2384
02:19:11,620 --> 02:19:16,020
it was, because Final Fantasy 14 wasn't working.

2385
02:19:16,020 --> 02:19:19,220
It was super laggy and it was cutting in and out and all this stuff.

2386
02:19:19,220 --> 02:19:22,580
So I was like, all right, I'm just going to switch to Dead by Daylight because I have

2387
02:19:22,580 --> 02:19:23,780
that up and ready to go.

2388
02:19:23,780 --> 02:19:26,260
It's very easy for me to hit the button to stream that.

2389
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:28,020
I'm going to do that as opposed to something else.

2390
02:19:28,020 --> 02:19:31,140
And Shane was like, I'll stay on, whatever.

2391
02:19:31,140 --> 02:19:33,540
And I'm like, OK, you know nothing about this game.

2392
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:35,220
He's like, yeah, it'll be fun.

2393
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:37,860
He's like, ooh, ooh, you should let me pick your killer.

2394
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:39,380
And I'm like, all right, let's do this.

2395
02:19:39,380 --> 02:19:40,740
That was funny.

2396
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:47,540
And then, oh, my God, it's like listening to grandma describe Pokemon because he literally

2397
02:19:47,540 --> 02:19:51,300
didn't fucking know who Freddy Krueger was.

2398
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:52,180
Or Myers.

2399
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:53,140
Or Myers.

2400
02:19:53,140 --> 02:19:57,060
And he would be like, oh, no, Bubba Leatherface.

2401
02:19:57,060 --> 02:19:59,140
He was like, that's Butthead, right?

2402
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:00,100
From Beavis and Butthead.

2403
02:20:00,900 --> 02:20:05,060
It was so I made a highlight of it.

2404
02:20:05,060 --> 02:20:06,820
It's on my personal channel at Rob Roberts.

2405
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:08,500
I highlighted that whole section.

2406
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:09,300
It was so funny.

2407
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:10,580
He guessed pig, right?

2408
02:20:10,580 --> 02:20:12,340
Well, he said no, he said Miss Piggy.

2409
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:14,660
He said Miss Piggy, but still close enough.

2410
02:20:19,060 --> 02:20:20,900
I like what did he call nurse?

2411
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:23,060
Pillow face.

2412
02:20:23,060 --> 02:20:24,420
Pillow face or something like that.

2413
02:20:25,860 --> 02:20:29,460
Pillow face, which was fairly accurate there, too.

2414
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:30,820
She had a pillowcase overhead.

2415
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:31,060
Yeah.

2416
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:34,100
So that was a fun little side stream.

2417
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:39,380
And you got a fucking 5K with Ghostface with whatever weird ass build he made for you.

2418
02:20:39,380 --> 02:20:39,540
Yeah.

2419
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:42,740
He also picked my build and he was giving me shit perks because he doesn't know what

2420
02:20:42,740 --> 02:20:43,460
he's picking.

2421
02:20:43,460 --> 02:20:47,940
I actually had my you weren't there because you came in when Tay raided me.

2422
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:48,580
Right.

2423
02:20:48,580 --> 02:20:54,500
So you only saw that he had just he was picking his perks for you.

2424
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:56,980
So you didn't see my survivor matches.

2425
02:20:56,980 --> 02:21:00,340
And in my survivor matches, I said, okay, Shane, pick any perk.

2426
02:21:00,340 --> 02:21:03,860
And like the first one he says, he goes carpal tunnel syndrome.

2427
02:21:03,860 --> 02:21:04,820
Do that one.

2428
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:06,180
I'm like carpal tunnel syndrome.

2429
02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:06,820
Which one's that?

2430
02:21:07,540 --> 02:21:08,180
No, neither.

2431
02:21:08,820 --> 02:21:10,260
Oh, was the one he was.

2432
02:21:10,260 --> 02:21:10,900
I said no.

2433
02:21:10,900 --> 02:21:13,140
I said, Shane, I'm going to put my foot down.

2434
02:21:13,140 --> 02:21:20,100
That is the one perk you are not allowed to pick because it's the only perk that actively

2435
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:21,540
hurts your character.

2436
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:23,140
And it's going to get me targeted.

2437
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:25,300
Thank you for saying it correctly.

2438
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:26,020
I looked it up.

2439
02:21:26,580 --> 02:21:27,060
Oh, yeah.

2440
02:21:27,940 --> 02:21:28,820
It's no, neither.

2441
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:30,580
Yeah, I've heard enough streamers say that.

2442
02:21:30,580 --> 02:21:36,580
It is Northern English slang for being annoyed for bitching.

2443
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:42,420
So it's like if you can't be bothered or can't be annoyed by it, it's no, neither.

2444
02:21:42,420 --> 02:21:47,220
But yeah, but I love Shane's day for carpal tunnel syndrome is the name of the perk.

2445
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:50,580
All right.

2446
02:21:51,380 --> 02:21:55,780
But I got fucking tunneled out of the game by a nemesis my first match.

2447
02:21:56,340 --> 02:22:00,180
Like my teammates were being awesome and trying to take hits and stuff.

2448
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:01,620
And that nemesis didn't care.

2449
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:04,740
And we think it was because of the pride charm, which sucks.

2450
02:22:04,740 --> 02:22:10,660
But that shows how long ways we have to go in gaming.

2451
02:22:10,660 --> 02:22:11,860
Me trying to play Claudette.

2452
02:22:14,260 --> 02:22:15,300
Got tunneled.

2453
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:20,740
It's just some people's children.

2454
02:22:20,740 --> 02:22:22,900
And not prestige, but adapted her.

2455
02:22:22,900 --> 02:22:23,220
Nice.

2456
02:22:23,860 --> 02:22:25,620
I have seven survivor adapts, Rob.

2457
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:29,380
As of right now, they're easier than the killer ones though.

2458
02:22:29,380 --> 02:22:30,100
Aren't they?

2459
02:22:30,100 --> 02:22:30,420
Right.

2460
02:22:32,660 --> 02:22:36,020
But, but I mean, this is what I'm doing.

2461
02:22:36,020 --> 02:22:39,780
I'm actually taking a, I'm doing what I'm doing with all the new killers right now.

2462
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:43,940
And just the first time I play them, I'm only using their default stuff.

2463
02:22:44,900 --> 02:22:48,340
And once I adapt them, then I can, you know, like right now.

2464
02:22:48,980 --> 02:22:52,180
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

2465
02:22:52,180 --> 02:22:53,700
I have to tell you something about that.

2466
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:55,540
Cause Rob and I were talking about this before.

2467
02:22:55,540 --> 02:22:56,500
I know I'm going off topic.

2468
02:22:57,300 --> 02:23:02,740
So Tay asks, spinoff podcast.

2469
02:23:02,740 --> 02:23:03,240
When?

2470
02:23:04,420 --> 02:23:10,340
So I've been talking with Rob and I've been talking with Finara about doing the state

2471
02:23:10,340 --> 02:23:17,540
of DBD in character hosted by miss Amanda Young, the pig.

2472
02:23:17,540 --> 02:23:23,460
But there's stuff going on about that.

2473
02:23:23,460 --> 02:23:28,500
Cause I'm also doing a visual novel style comic sort of thing.

2474
02:23:28,500 --> 02:23:30,740
That's also kind of in the backend of some stuff.

2475
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:35,380
Finara and I have actually been getting like screenshots and some, some stuff playing together.

2476
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:43,860
But but that one's going to be the adventures of Amanda and Meg, the secret besties.

2477
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:52,820
Um, but, uh, but I think, I think that that's got merit and I need more voice people to be guests.

2478
02:23:55,540 --> 02:23:56,900
I'll go ahead and just throw it out there.

2479
02:23:56,900 --> 02:23:59,140
Now it's, it's, it's something I'm working on in the background.

2480
02:23:59,140 --> 02:24:00,180
Get Tay to do a voice.

2481
02:24:00,180 --> 02:24:01,860
I think who should Tay voice?

2482
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:03,080
Claudette.

2483
02:24:04,100 --> 02:24:05,700
No, I don't think he should voice Claudette.

2484
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:08,180
I'm trying, I think he would definitely be a killer.

2485
02:24:08,180 --> 02:24:11,620
And I'm trying to think which killer, uh, which killer would Tay be?

2486
02:24:12,580 --> 02:24:16,340
Probably it's gotta be somebody he really thinks is sweaty and doesn't like.

2487
02:24:17,620 --> 02:24:18,120
Trickster?

2488
02:24:18,820 --> 02:24:20,740
No, we need someone actually new.

2489
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:21,300
Legion.

2490
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:23,460
No, cause I bet you or Finara want to do Legion.

2491
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:24,660
No, I was going to do Julie.

2492
02:24:25,460 --> 02:24:25,940
Bubba.

2493
02:24:25,940 --> 02:24:26,740
Bubba's a good one.

2494
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:28,100
Tay should definitely do Bubba.

2495
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:29,140
No, Tay should be Frank.

2496
02:24:30,100 --> 02:24:30,420
All right.

2497
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:31,940
Anyway, Frank and Bubba.

2498
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:33,220
You're going to be Frank and Bubba.

2499
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:34,260
I'm hiring you.

2500
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:36,500
We've made that transition clearly into our-

2501
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:37,620
Rob is going to be Nia.

2502
02:24:38,180 --> 02:24:41,460
We've, we've made that transition clearly into our gaming weeks.

2503
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:44,820
So let's talk a little bit about the other games we've been playing this week.

2504
02:24:44,820 --> 02:24:48,500
Dark Soccer, I don't want to spend an hour on Dead by Daylight, but I did notice you

2505
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:49,620
are now playing Survivor.

2506
02:24:49,620 --> 02:24:52,580
You finally broke the ice in playing Survivor.

2507
02:24:52,580 --> 02:24:53,460
And I feel like-

2508
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:54,580
I got forced into it.

2509
02:24:54,580 --> 02:24:58,260
I was like, now that you've had your first hit, I feel like you're kind of, I, I feel

2510
02:24:58,260 --> 02:25:01,780
I'm getting the read, you're kind of into it, but why don't you tell us what's, what's,

2511
02:25:01,780 --> 02:25:02,900
what's the latest on DVD?

2512
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:03,400
Okay.

2513
02:25:03,700 --> 02:25:08,580
So back in the day, I tried to play Survivor and I hated it.

2514
02:25:08,580 --> 02:25:10,420
That was at least in the demo.

2515
02:25:10,420 --> 02:25:11,700
There's video of this.

2516
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:18,180
It's on my TikTok of me going around saying, stop healing me.

2517
02:25:18,180 --> 02:25:18,900
I want to die.

2518
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:30,420
So at any rate, I played, I played two games with, for Thirst Trap, the thing that, that

2519
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:31,460
Nick and Isaaco do.

2520
02:25:32,180 --> 02:25:35,380
And one game I think Homotron was in it.

2521
02:25:35,380 --> 02:25:40,020
And the other one was Anti Vortex, if I want to, if I remember correctly.

2522
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:40,980
Nope.

2523
02:25:40,980 --> 02:25:41,300
Nope.

2524
02:25:41,300 --> 02:25:47,860
Cosinon was in one and Anti Vortex was in the other, but at any rate, and I had a hundred

2525
02:25:47,860 --> 02:25:49,060
percent survival rate.

2526
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:50,260
They covered my butt.

2527
02:25:50,260 --> 02:25:53,300
I, I went to the wrong gate both times and just opened it and left.

2528
02:25:54,820 --> 02:25:56,180
But it was all right.

2529
02:25:56,180 --> 02:26:00,500
You know, I was, I was screaming the entire time and going, oh shit and fucking stuff

2530
02:26:00,500 --> 02:26:00,660
up.

2531
02:26:00,660 --> 02:26:06,900
And, you know, I got hooked exactly once and I was like, okay, I have a hundred percent

2532
02:26:06,900 --> 02:26:07,700
survival rate.

2533
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:08,660
I'm not going to ruin it.

2534
02:26:08,660 --> 02:26:09,860
No more Survivor.

2535
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:16,660
And then the anniversary came out and there was a cosmetic, cause you know, my favorite

2536
02:26:16,660 --> 02:26:19,620
thing to do with my survivors is to make them a fashion show.

2537
02:26:20,420 --> 02:26:23,300
Glamour is the end game of any game as a service.

2538
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:27,700
That is my whole point for even having survivors is to dress them up pretty.

2539
02:26:28,660 --> 02:26:37,060
And there's cosmetic came out for Hattie, the new survivor that I needed all of it.

2540
02:26:37,060 --> 02:26:38,340
It was so cute.

2541
02:26:38,340 --> 02:26:39,380
I needed it.

2542
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:46,660
And so I, I told Venara, look, I have to play Hattie and please play with me.

2543
02:26:46,660 --> 02:26:47,380
Keep me alive.

2544
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:52,020
And Venara has been my backbone, my, my gaming partner.

2545
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:54,980
We were, we were, uh, college roommates.

2546
02:26:54,980 --> 02:26:58,820
I have known Venara more than some of you have been alive.

2547
02:27:00,260 --> 02:27:04,100
So, um, she's been the Nancy to your Drew, but not literally Nancy.

2548
02:27:04,900 --> 02:27:05,460
Hmm.

2549
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:06,260
I don't know.

2550
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:11,140
I'm trying to think of famous, uh, uh, crime fighting duo is in history.

2551
02:27:11,140 --> 02:27:13,860
The hard is like the, what's your face to my Daria.

2552
02:27:13,860 --> 02:27:14,180
Okay.

2553
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:16,100
Oh, Jane, Jane.

2554
02:27:16,100 --> 02:27:17,140
She's a Jane to my Daria.

2555
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:25,540
Um, but anyway, um, I, I, I played and I was like, okay, I'm just going to start off and

2556
02:27:25,540 --> 02:27:28,020
do a depths, you know, just adapt the whole time.

2557
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:32,820
Um, and I got through a few games and I was like, you know what?

2558
02:27:32,820 --> 02:27:34,980
This doesn't exactly suck.

2559
02:27:34,980 --> 02:27:39,140
And the thing is what really cinched it for me.

2560
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:39,460
Okay.

2561
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:39,780
Yeah.

2562
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:40,980
I did Michaela next.

2563
02:27:40,980 --> 02:27:41,940
I had points in her.

2564
02:27:41,940 --> 02:27:42,900
I did Claire next.

2565
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:45,620
I had points in her because I had wanted, you know, Claire.

2566
02:27:45,620 --> 02:27:46,580
Cause that was my thing.

2567
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:50,580
And I played Meg because I like Meg and Meg was pretty fun.

2568
02:27:50,580 --> 02:27:52,340
It was like GTFO powers.

2569
02:27:52,340 --> 02:27:52,740
I'm down.

2570
02:27:53,700 --> 02:27:56,740
But what cinched it for me was playing Mia.

2571
02:27:59,060 --> 02:28:01,220
Little sneaky ass ninja girl, Nia.

2572
02:28:01,620 --> 02:28:04,340
I am an urban evading.

2573
02:28:06,260 --> 02:28:08,420
You are an urban evasion, Nia.

2574
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:11,140
And you are not going to apologize for it.

2575
02:28:11,140 --> 02:28:16,340
I am an urban evasion, a balanced landing pebble Nia.

2576
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:25,700
I tried for the record to use Dead Hard once.

2577
02:28:27,140 --> 02:28:28,420
I don't like Dead Hard.

2578
02:28:28,420 --> 02:28:29,220
They're changing that.

2579
02:28:29,220 --> 02:28:30,020
They're all changing.

2580
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:32,340
They're all, all those perks are changing anyway.

2581
02:28:32,340 --> 02:28:35,140
Well, yeah, but still I figured I'm just going to use it while I can.

2582
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:39,620
And booming, I felt completely filthy the whole time on Michaela.

2583
02:28:39,620 --> 02:28:47,540
So I was like, but sneaking around and throwing the pebble and I have like self-heal on her

2584
02:28:47,540 --> 02:28:53,300
for right now, just because people have been kind of, but our self-care.

2585
02:28:54,180 --> 02:28:58,100
But Nia's actually been pretty fun.

2586
02:28:58,900 --> 02:29:01,620
And I'm kind of digging it, although I'm going to work.

2587
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:03,060
I did Claudette as well.

2588
02:29:03,620 --> 02:29:04,580
It was okay.

2589
02:29:04,580 --> 02:29:05,300
Little boring.

2590
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:05,620
Sorry.

2591
02:29:05,620 --> 02:29:07,060
I know Tay, Claudette's your girl.

2592
02:29:07,060 --> 02:29:10,340
It's kind of boring to me, but I'm going to do Fang next.

2593
02:29:12,100 --> 02:29:16,500
And then I'm probably going to do Cheryl, but I don't know.

2594
02:29:17,460 --> 02:29:21,540
My Nia is like level 48 right now.

2595
02:29:23,060 --> 02:29:25,780
And this is me playing her for exactly two days.

2596
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:31,380
So, I mean, yeah, we are getting the bonus points and everything, but well, I don't know

2597
02:29:31,380 --> 02:29:31,620
Tay.

2598
02:29:31,620 --> 02:29:32,500
I have a, all right.

2599
02:29:32,500 --> 02:29:36,020
So Tay says, I mean, all survivors are literally just reskins to hold perks, but I don't take

2600
02:29:36,020 --> 02:29:36,740
it personally.

2601
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:39,220
No, some survivors though are loud as fuck and annoying.

2602
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:45,380
I don't, my problem with Claudette is that she sounds like a whimpering puppy when she's

2603
02:29:45,380 --> 02:29:49,860
hurt and I can hear her across any freaking map.

2604
02:29:49,860 --> 02:29:56,900
And I'm like, if I can hear a Claudette from halfway across the map, they'll be able to

2605
02:29:56,900 --> 02:30:01,060
hear me or who else is loud and annoying?

2606
02:30:02,020 --> 02:30:02,500
Yujin?

2607
02:30:03,860 --> 02:30:04,660
Just a few of them.

2608
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:07,540
Jill, Jill's kind of annoying.

2609
02:30:08,580 --> 02:30:13,300
Nia, however, if she's in crouch mode, you don't hear shit.

2610
02:30:13,300 --> 02:30:13,860
I love her.

2611
02:30:14,420 --> 02:30:17,220
She is the Ninja and that, and I have her in a brown outfit with green hair.

2612
02:30:18,100 --> 02:30:20,340
Just dump me on mother's dwelling and I will hide.

2613
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:25,540
But anyway, it all started because of my need for cosmetics.

2614
02:30:26,980 --> 02:30:32,100
It's Nia, N-E-A, the November Echo Alpha.

2615
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:34,020
Did I NATO Alpha that right?

2616
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:34,740
Close enough.

2617
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:35,860
Yeah.

2618
02:30:35,860 --> 02:30:36,580
And she's Swedish.

2619
02:30:38,980 --> 02:30:45,700
But anyway, but anyway, that is, that is what got me into playing survivor and the thing

2620
02:30:46,420 --> 02:30:55,860
that I actually find fun about it is that because I've played killer so long, I know

2621
02:30:55,860 --> 02:30:59,540
a lot of tricks that people who only play survivor don't.

2622
02:31:02,180 --> 02:31:06,900
Now, my problem is that because I have to use this, you know, thumb trackball for ergonomic

2623
02:31:06,900 --> 02:31:13,940
reasons, I can't look behind me when I run, but I've found it's actually kind of easy

2624
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:14,740
to spin people.

2625
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:20,100
Like I have a hard time if people try to spin me as killer and my, uh, counteraction to

2626
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:24,180
that is that when people start to do the spin, I stop and they run into me and then I stab

2627
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:25,380
them in the face and it's awesome.

2628
02:31:26,420 --> 02:31:29,620
But I was spinning this nurse yesterday.

2629
02:31:29,620 --> 02:31:32,980
I mean, she was getting me, you know, at other times, but I was getting some good spins on

2630
02:31:32,980 --> 02:31:33,140
that.

2631
02:31:33,140 --> 02:31:34,580
And on top of that, I was like, is this Elsie?

2632
02:31:34,580 --> 02:31:35,620
Cause it was a compo nurse.

2633
02:31:36,980 --> 02:31:39,780
And then the, um, the weapon was the wrong weapon.

2634
02:31:40,980 --> 02:31:42,980
And then this person obviously wasn't Elsie.

2635
02:31:42,980 --> 02:31:43,700
I'll just put it that way.

2636
02:31:43,700 --> 02:31:46,100
If I could spin her, it wasn't, it wasn't Elsie.

2637
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:46,500
No.

2638
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:46,900
Yeah.

2639
02:31:46,900 --> 02:31:48,420
Um, it was a bit at any rate.

2640
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:53,300
That was, it was my, uh, aesthetic senses that got me into playing survivor.

2641
02:31:53,300 --> 02:31:53,780
There you go.

2642
02:31:54,420 --> 02:31:56,500
And I'm having fun because I'm playing with friends.

2643
02:31:56,500 --> 02:31:58,340
Now we'll hear from both coasts on Dev I daily.

2644
02:31:58,340 --> 02:31:59,700
And I love playing with you too, Rob.

2645
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:00,660
That was awesome.

2646
02:32:00,660 --> 02:32:03,780
I joined for a little bit on, I think two of your streams actually.

2647
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:04,900
So yeah, you did.

2648
02:32:04,900 --> 02:32:05,380
You did.

2649
02:32:05,380 --> 02:32:11,380
Cause I, I, I did, I actually, I was going to do all killer on Thursday and Friday.

2650
02:32:11,380 --> 02:32:15,940
And then, uh, I did, uh, I ended up doing survivor both of those days.

2651
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:18,660
And then I forgot I was streaming last night for some stupid reason.

2652
02:32:18,660 --> 02:32:19,700
I just wanted your flan.

2653
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:21,540
Yeah.

2654
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:25,300
But I played two games with, uh, Elsie and company last night.

2655
02:32:26,020 --> 02:32:26,740
That's fun.

2656
02:32:26,740 --> 02:32:28,500
And they were playing protect the Sakura.

2657
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:30,420
It was cute.

2658
02:32:31,300 --> 02:32:34,740
Getting involved in the streamer communities and stuff is really, really fun.

2659
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:35,140
I think.

2660
02:32:35,140 --> 02:32:35,380
Yeah.

2661
02:32:36,180 --> 02:32:37,300
Funara the meat shield.

2662
02:32:38,260 --> 02:32:41,300
And then, uh, and then Sierra was like, aren't you supposed to be streaming?

2663
02:32:41,300 --> 02:32:42,820
And I'm like, oh yeah.

2664
02:32:42,820 --> 02:32:46,180
So I did a bunch of killer matches and help people farm.

2665
02:32:46,180 --> 02:32:50,260
And just, uh, I was trying to finish getting the community achievement.

2666
02:32:51,380 --> 02:32:56,180
And I couldn't, because I'm not that good at evasion as survivor yet.

2667
02:32:56,180 --> 02:32:57,940
I did the chaser one is killer.

2668
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:00,420
Um, and that was pretty fun.

2669
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:05,940
And I met new people and I made new friends and now I'm 15 followers away from 500.

2670
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:07,300
Oh, so close.

2671
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:08,180
Get there, get there close.

2672
02:33:08,180 --> 02:33:10,500
We have some people who haven't visited in a long time tonight.

2673
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:12,100
Be sure to drop your Twitch in there.

2674
02:33:12,580 --> 02:33:17,700
Uh, of course I'll still be playing afterwards and maybe not for my full three hours now,

2675
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:19,380
but I might be playing for a little bit after.

2676
02:33:19,380 --> 02:33:19,940
Yeah.

2677
02:33:19,940 --> 02:33:20,420
All right.

2678
02:33:20,420 --> 02:33:20,920
Yeah.

2679
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:22,740
I'll shout myself out.

2680
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:25,060
Um, let's see.

2681
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:28,020
Um, so my gaming week, I'll, I'll just keep it real brief.

2682
02:33:28,020 --> 02:33:31,700
Um, with the new computer, I've been playing a lot of the same stuff, but it's just so

2683
02:33:31,700 --> 02:33:35,380
nice to play things like Final Fantasy 14 and it's so smooth.

2684
02:33:35,380 --> 02:33:38,660
Uh, and, uh, I also play a little dead by daylight as we talked about earlier.

2685
02:33:38,660 --> 02:33:41,940
And then I've actually been spending a lot of time on Diablo two resurrected.

2686
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:47,540
I know like how random, but I did, it was, it was a little, it played okay on my old

2687
02:33:47,540 --> 02:33:49,300
computer, but on this one, Oh, it's butter.

2688
02:33:49,300 --> 02:33:50,500
And it looks so good.

2689
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:52,340
And the reflections are so nice.

2690
02:33:52,340 --> 02:33:55,940
And, uh, the whole thing just has me hype for Diablo four, to be honest.

2691
02:33:55,940 --> 02:33:57,780
I'm not sure I'm going to play much more Diablo two.

2692
02:33:57,780 --> 02:34:00,740
Cause it's just like, Oh yeah, that old game was really grindy.

2693
02:34:00,740 --> 02:34:02,580
You had to drop a lot of hours in this game.

2694
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:05,780
But, um, it has me hype for Diablo four.

2695
02:34:05,780 --> 02:34:08,420
And I'm, I'm just excited to see the pretty graphics.

2696
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:10,180
I also played no man's sky.

2697
02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:11,940
What I, um, big shock, right?

2698
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:13,700
But here's the pleasant surprise.

2699
02:34:13,700 --> 02:34:17,780
I've always said that the Microsoft stuff and the things you earn there, you can't use

2700
02:34:17,780 --> 02:34:19,140
them in the steam version.

2701
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:19,940
Well, guess what?

2702
02:34:19,940 --> 02:34:24,900
If you download the windows game pass version instead, everything transfers over because

2703
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:26,340
it's still Xbox.

2704
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:28,580
So I can play on PC and keep all my crap.

2705
02:34:28,580 --> 02:34:32,180
I just have to play in the windows store and I'm totally fine doing that.

2706
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:34,340
It really doesn't fucking matter to me what store it's on.

2707
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:35,620
I just want to play the game.

2708
02:34:35,620 --> 02:34:39,940
So I stayed in my steamer, like for dead by daylight, if I can ever get dead by daylight

2709
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:45,140
to run on steam, then all of my, uh, achievements and cosmetics will carry over.

2710
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:46,180
Oh yeah.

2711
02:34:46,180 --> 02:34:46,420
Yeah.

2712
02:34:46,420 --> 02:34:48,020
Cause the, yeah, that's nice for that game.

2713
02:34:48,020 --> 02:34:48,580
Yeah.

2714
02:34:48,580 --> 02:34:50,020
So, um, that's it.

2715
02:34:50,020 --> 02:34:50,660
I'll keep it short.

2716
02:34:50,660 --> 02:34:53,860
Cause I know we still have like our classic game and stuff, but Loki, I want to get to

2717
02:34:53,860 --> 02:34:54,180
you too.

2718
02:34:54,180 --> 02:34:55,140
How was your gaming week?

2719
02:34:55,700 --> 02:34:56,980
It was Minecraft.

2720
02:34:56,980 --> 02:34:57,780
Surprise.

2721
02:34:57,780 --> 02:35:05,700
Um, no, this week we, I started off on the new, actually it was last week, um, on that

2722
02:35:05,700 --> 02:35:09,300
Saturday started on channel 64, the new SMP that I'm playing on.

2723
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:15,380
And so I put out my first episode this week, which is, um, a little bit shorter than I

2724
02:35:15,380 --> 02:35:15,780
want to.

2725
02:35:15,780 --> 02:35:20,500
The problem was I did so much in that like first few days that I couldn't really fit

2726
02:35:20,500 --> 02:35:21,940
what I wanted to include in there.

2727
02:35:21,940 --> 02:35:27,060
So that's going to be kind of this next episode plus a build, uh, which I'm working on right

2728
02:35:27,060 --> 02:35:27,700
now.

2729
02:35:27,700 --> 02:35:31,460
Um, so yeah, it's been, it's been a lot of fun.

2730
02:35:31,460 --> 02:35:33,220
So I've been really enjoying that.

2731
02:35:33,220 --> 02:35:38,660
And then as far as other things, there weren't other things as usual.

2732
02:35:39,220 --> 02:35:39,620
All right.

2733
02:35:40,180 --> 02:35:40,820
But you got some.

2734
02:35:40,820 --> 02:35:41,380
Oh no, no, no.

2735
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:41,700
I'm sorry.

2736
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:41,940
Sorry.

2737
02:35:41,940 --> 02:35:42,420
Sorry.

2738
02:35:42,420 --> 02:35:45,220
There was one other thing also Minecraft.

2739
02:35:45,220 --> 02:35:53,540
Um, so I film what probably will be the last episode of my hardcore series in which I fought

2740
02:35:53,540 --> 02:35:59,380
the under dragon with about eight to 10 wardens also running around at the same time.

2741
02:35:59,940 --> 02:36:00,980
So that was fun.

2742
02:36:00,980 --> 02:36:03,380
So think that'll be coming out.

2743
02:36:03,380 --> 02:36:07,860
I don't know if I want to continue that series anymore or if I can, you know, I don't want

2744
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:09,060
to spoil anything.

2745
02:36:09,060 --> 02:36:14,100
Um, so that may be the end, but that'll be coming out soon.

2746
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:15,380
I just have to edit it down.

2747
02:36:16,980 --> 02:36:17,380
All right.

2748
02:36:18,420 --> 02:36:18,820
Okay.

2749
02:36:18,820 --> 02:36:23,300
Uh, because of all the great questions, our Q and a segment tonight went pretty much took

2750
02:36:23,300 --> 02:36:24,900
up the entire show, which is fine.

2751
02:36:24,900 --> 02:36:28,180
I don't, I wouldn't want to spend our 20th show any other way, but we did kind of end

2752
02:36:28,180 --> 02:36:29,620
up saying, fuck the news.

2753
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:32,580
Uh, we will quickly run through the headlines this week.

2754
02:36:32,580 --> 02:36:36,820
We're going to spend no more than like two sentences on each headline.

2755
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:40,180
So our first story, Sony is skipping games com.

2756
02:36:40,180 --> 02:36:41,700
I don't know if there's a lot more to say than that.

2757
02:36:41,700 --> 02:36:43,940
Loki, they're not going to be there.

2758
02:36:44,980 --> 02:36:46,340
Maybe they'll do their own thing.

2759
02:36:46,340 --> 02:36:47,060
Is it a big deal?

2760
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:51,060
Um, I don't know if they have anything in the show.

2761
02:36:51,060 --> 02:36:54,580
Honestly, I think they might just be saving for their own thing.

2762
02:36:54,580 --> 02:36:58,180
Um, and I think there'd be a lot of questions about VR too and stuff.

2763
02:36:58,180 --> 02:37:03,140
I just think, you know, even though many people have decided the pandemic is over, I don't

2764
02:37:03,140 --> 02:37:04,340
think it really is.

2765
02:37:04,340 --> 02:37:05,780
And there's a lot of that.

2766
02:37:05,780 --> 02:37:09,060
That's probably of a concern to Sony as well, where it's like, maybe now just isn't really

2767
02:37:09,060 --> 02:37:12,580
the time, especially if they want to, if they want to show off a VR headset, the middle

2768
02:37:12,580 --> 02:37:14,500
of the pandemic is not a great time to do that.

2769
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:16,580
So no recession.

2770
02:37:16,580 --> 02:37:17,080
Yeah.

2771
02:37:17,860 --> 02:37:19,540
Activision stockholders.

2772
02:37:19,860 --> 02:37:24,260
I know that, um, Bobby Kotick is still going to be on the board, which has a lot of people

2773
02:37:24,260 --> 02:37:27,220
saying literally what the fuck is happening.

2774
02:37:27,220 --> 02:37:29,220
Um, because that's some bullshit.

2775
02:37:29,220 --> 02:37:34,660
Um, but otherwise there's this weird thing where the stockholders had voted to release

2776
02:37:34,660 --> 02:37:39,700
the annual harassment reports and the company has said, we'll consider doing that.

2777
02:37:41,940 --> 02:37:46,580
The stockholders seriously need to revolt and Bobby Kotick needs to be thrown out on

2778
02:37:46,580 --> 02:37:48,180
his stupid ass.

2779
02:37:48,180 --> 02:37:54,660
I just, that guy's day of reckoning is long overdue, long overdue, um, dark soccer.

2780
02:37:54,660 --> 02:37:58,580
This ties into the beginning of the show, but the, um, video game companies talking

2781
02:37:58,580 --> 02:38:00,020
about the Supreme court ruling.

2782
02:38:00,580 --> 02:38:01,060
Oh yeah.

2783
02:38:01,060 --> 02:38:02,180
Bungie blasted them.

2784
02:38:02,180 --> 02:38:07,940
So many other companies are standing in solidarity and there's a lot of companies out there that

2785
02:38:07,940 --> 02:38:13,300
are, uh, basically already offering to pay travel expenses for people who have to go

2786
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:16,900
out of state for, uh, for their healthcare.

2787
02:38:16,900 --> 02:38:17,400
Yeah.

2788
02:38:18,040 --> 02:38:23,640
Uh, Sonic origins ha had, um, it launched, but I guess it's got issues, right?

2789
02:38:23,640 --> 02:38:24,140
Logie.

2790
02:38:24,760 --> 02:38:25,080
Yeah.

2791
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:30,920
It was developed under a major time crunches and it was also not necessarily perfect when

2792
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:31,800
it came out.

2793
02:38:31,800 --> 02:38:37,800
And according to some of the devs, they were complaining about, um, some of the performance,

2794
02:38:37,800 --> 02:38:41,720
you know, that they had basically, you know, that their performance under such pressure,

2795
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:46,440
but you know, everyone is very unhappy about the state of origins and even the Sonic three

2796
02:38:46,440 --> 02:38:47,000
component.

2797
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:53,720
Um, I know they're like Sonic three, for example, also had like some of the music changed in

2798
02:38:53,720 --> 02:38:56,440
it because of licensing issues, which this is great.

2799
02:38:56,440 --> 02:39:02,280
Cause we did get a confirmation from Yuji Naka that Michael Jackson did end up composing

2800
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:03,400
music for Sonic three.

2801
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:05,240
It was heavily suggested.

2802
02:39:05,240 --> 02:39:07,640
Now the internet can shut the fuck up about that.

2803
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:08,040
God.

2804
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:10,600
But like it was legit actually though.

2805
02:39:10,600 --> 02:39:11,160
It's funny though.

2806
02:39:11,160 --> 02:39:16,360
Cause there is a video I watched about talking about the, um, comparison by game explain

2807
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:20,440
and actually some of the music isn't necessarily from Michael Jackson.

2808
02:39:20,440 --> 02:39:28,680
One of them is literally like a chip tune version of a, um, actual like song that wasn't

2809
02:39:28,680 --> 02:39:29,960
by Michael Jackson.

2810
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:34,680
So they couldn't include that as well because, you know, you didn't license that song.

2811
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:36,680
So oops, oops.

2812
02:39:37,560 --> 02:39:38,040
All right.

2813
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:39,640
Um, let's see.

2814
02:39:39,640 --> 02:39:43,880
Our next story was that there was a Xenoblade Chronicles three direct this week, uh, from

2815
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:44,280
Nintendo.

2816
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:47,240
So Nintendo did a direct, but it was all about Xenoblade Chronicles three.

2817
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:50,840
And honestly, it just kind of made me think I need to go back and really beat the first

2818
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:51,000
game.

2819
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,040
Cause it was really fun.

2820
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:55,480
I played like 10, 15 hours of it, but I never actually beat it because that game can take

2821
02:39:55,480 --> 02:39:56,680
hundreds of hours.

2822
02:39:56,680 --> 02:40:01,080
I wasn't as into the second game, but I wonder if it's because I didn't really finish the

2823
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:03,800
first one, although the two stories are disconnected.

2824
02:40:03,800 --> 02:40:07,560
But yeah, I know the people that are really hyped for that series really enjoyed the direct.

2825
02:40:07,560 --> 02:40:10,200
A lot of different things are planning to do with it, like amiibo support and things

2826
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:10,600
like that.

2827
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:12,200
So it's going to be a real good summer.

2828
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:16,840
If you're a Xenoblade fan, cause there's a whole nother game for you to eat up, uh,

2829
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:19,160
dark soccer, you'd reference Stadia earlier in the show.

2830
02:40:20,360 --> 02:40:27,880
Stadia is hiring right now for, um, an engineering manager, immersive stream for games, Stadia.

2831
02:40:28,840 --> 02:40:35,080
Um, and basically, uh, they are looking into major projects.

2832
02:40:35,080 --> 02:40:40,360
So basically wanting someone to major, uh, to lead a team for designers.

2833
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:47,480
Um, and then, um, of course there's also that expansion into having Intel compatible games.

2834
02:40:47,480 --> 02:40:55,480
Um, they're still not leaving the AMD universe, but there's also, uh, as seen in their change

2835
02:40:55,480 --> 02:41:00,920
log, there's also, uh, uh, evidence that there's going to be a saints row release.

2836
02:41:00,920 --> 02:41:07,880
Um, and, uh, they're gonna, they're go leading to Stadia 4.18.

2837
02:41:07,880 --> 02:41:13,720
So there will be different exploration, uh, 1440p and motion controls.

2838
02:41:15,080 --> 02:41:19,000
So long story short Stadia is not as dead as a lot of people seem to think it is.

2839
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,440
They're still expanding.

2840
02:41:20,440 --> 02:41:20,940
Yup.

2841
02:41:21,560 --> 02:41:26,760
Uh, Loki, I talked about this game earlier, Pokemon go and we're debating it again, right?

2842
02:41:27,480 --> 02:41:31,960
It's it's, it's just more of the same stuff we've been hearing for a while now about how

2843
02:41:31,960 --> 02:41:39,320
Niantic keeps pulling back different things that they had put in place during the pandemic

2844
02:41:39,320 --> 02:41:41,240
that people kind of got accustomed to.

2845
02:41:41,240 --> 02:41:46,600
And now, um, you know, especially like with remote rating, um, they stopped giving out

2846
02:41:46,600 --> 02:41:53,320
the free, uh, weekly one, uh, coin remote rate pass, um, that was available.

2847
02:41:53,320 --> 02:41:59,080
And then now they've chart or they're upping the cost of the three remote rate passes.

2848
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:05,080
So now that's instead of, you know, paying 250 where you get like a 50 coin discount

2849
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:12,040
for buying three, uh, it is now just 100 coins each pass, which is kind of annoying.

2850
02:42:12,040 --> 02:42:16,680
Plus they also decided that half the length of the community day from the six to three

2851
02:42:16,680 --> 02:42:20,120
hours, uh, from 11 AM to 2 PM only.

2852
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:27,880
So, and they're saying that there's, was it the ability to ask or that players are also

2853
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:32,760
going to be able to extend the day past 2 PM by taking part in a new type of gym.

2854
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:36,280
That was the whole real new thing that they did with this community day, which I didn't

2855
02:42:36,280 --> 02:42:37,240
care for.

2856
02:42:37,240 --> 02:42:39,720
Um, this part, because Mike Deaf says this is old news.

2857
02:42:39,720 --> 02:42:43,480
Yeah, the, the, the recapping going on this week is kind of encompassing both what happened

2858
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:47,480
before and what they did with this community day, which they made some changes and it made

2859
02:42:47,480 --> 02:42:50,520
the evolved form of dino spawn more often.

2860
02:42:50,520 --> 02:42:51,800
I did community day.

2861
02:42:51,800 --> 02:42:52,840
It was hot out.

2862
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:54,200
I did not have a good time.

2863
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:58,040
I caught my three shinies and I was done and it was a lot harder to catch shinies cause

2864
02:42:58,040 --> 02:43:00,360
that stupid evolved zelius or whatever.

2865
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:04,280
Well, it was nice to, I understand people wanted it for the exile candy, but those things

2866
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:06,440
can't be shiny and it was silly.

2867
02:43:06,440 --> 02:43:10,920
And then the raid thing, it was like, I'm not, I can't, the, the problem with Niantic's

2868
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:13,400
thinking about, we're going to get out everybody in person.

2869
02:43:13,400 --> 02:43:17,960
Well, when they limit it to certain timeframes and stuff, it was a hundred degrees here.

2870
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:19,400
No, I'm not doing that.

2871
02:43:19,480 --> 02:43:24,840
So it was just, I, there's still a lot of, a lot of kinks to be worked out.

2872
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:25,880
That's for sure.

2873
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:28,760
And that's the weather isn't all like the Bay area.

2874
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:29,480
Exactly.

2875
02:43:29,480 --> 02:43:33,080
Everywhere in the country, in the ferry building where Niantic's located.

2876
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:33,400
All right.

2877
02:43:33,400 --> 02:43:34,840
Anyway, uh, moving on.

2878
02:43:35,720 --> 02:43:39,720
Halo master chief collection is looking at adding microtransactions, which is surprising

2879
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:43,400
is that game is eight years old, but, um, I kind of go, you know what?

2880
02:43:43,400 --> 02:43:47,320
Mario Kart eight is also that old and they're still releasing DLC.

2881
02:43:47,320 --> 02:43:48,360
So you know what?

2882
02:43:48,360 --> 02:43:52,440
If they want to extend the life of that game, just make the microtransactions have value.

2883
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:55,240
I'm not sure if it's silly cosmetics, it'll have value, but

2884
02:43:56,920 --> 02:44:02,120
Halo master chief collection is kind of like the Wii sports of game pass.

2885
02:44:02,920 --> 02:44:06,360
And I feel like even though, yes, that game is eight years old, it's like that greatest

2886
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:07,560
hits collection.

2887
02:44:07,560 --> 02:44:09,240
It's like Abba gold.

2888
02:44:09,240 --> 02:44:12,920
It's a CD that's going to sell for years and years and years and years.

2889
02:44:12,920 --> 02:44:14,360
Cause it's just the classics.

2890
02:44:14,360 --> 02:44:15,960
And I think that's kind of where Halo master chief.

2891
02:44:15,960 --> 02:44:19,160
But I don't think this is, I don't think this is like that though, because they're

2892
02:44:19,160 --> 02:44:24,280
adding an in game currency, which it's because they want to do a battle pass.

2893
02:44:24,280 --> 02:44:25,480
I'm sure with the multiplayer.

2894
02:44:25,480 --> 02:44:25,640
Yeah.

2895
02:44:25,640 --> 02:44:30,440
But like you could just sell that stuff for like real money.

2896
02:44:30,440 --> 02:44:31,400
Like you just buy it.

2897
02:44:31,400 --> 02:44:33,160
You don't have to buy an in game current.

2898
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:33,880
I mean, I get it.

2899
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:35,720
They want to turn it into a live service.

2900
02:44:35,720 --> 02:44:38,600
Maybe because Halo Infinite's not working as well for them.

2901
02:44:38,600 --> 02:44:39,080
I don't know.

2902
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:40,920
Or maybe they just double dip that stuff.

2903
02:44:40,920 --> 02:44:43,560
But, um, yeah, I don't like it.

2904
02:44:44,440 --> 02:44:45,720
Do do something else.

2905
02:44:45,720 --> 02:44:49,320
Like if you're going to do that, or like, you know, the master chief collection is not

2906
02:44:49,320 --> 02:44:52,440
free, you know, make, make it free then.

2907
02:44:52,440 --> 02:44:54,280
No, but it is, it is a game pass.

2908
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:57,880
And I think a lot of people are, are which, but I know game pass is free.

2909
02:44:57,880 --> 02:45:02,120
I'm just saying, I think they're loading it a little bit because they know this is like

2910
02:45:02,120 --> 02:45:03,400
a go-to staple.

2911
02:45:03,400 --> 02:45:05,000
Many people install with game pass.

2912
02:45:05,720 --> 02:45:07,080
Sort of my thought on that.

2913
02:45:07,080 --> 02:45:09,320
Just, you know, vote with your wallet.

2914
02:45:09,320 --> 02:45:09,800
That's right.

2915
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:11,240
Vote with your wallet at the end of the day.

2916
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:12,680
All right.

2917
02:45:12,680 --> 02:45:16,600
Well, now we're going to, in our next segment, take a trip down memory lane to a game that

2918
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:21,560
is way too old for them to patch with microtransactions.

2919
02:45:21,560 --> 02:45:24,040
And I'm sure many of you are very curious.

2920
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:25,480
What did Jamie pick?

2921
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:26,920
20 year old show tonight.

2922
02:45:26,920 --> 02:45:29,320
Let's go roll the bumper.

2923
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:45,240
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

2924
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:47,560
out a classic and tell you about it.

2925
02:45:47,560 --> 02:45:50,200
It's time for the classic game of the week.

2926
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:56,120
And I have to admit, I'm only a little surprised at this pick because I thought, oh, she'll

2927
02:45:56,120 --> 02:45:59,960
do like Bamani DDR or something, but you went kind of a different direction.

2928
02:45:59,960 --> 02:46:05,400
You were like, I'm going to pick a classic bold, underlined, italic.

2929
02:46:05,400 --> 02:46:14,280
Like this game is how we have many other, many other games, a genre of games, but dark

2930
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:15,320
soccer, I will say no more.

2931
02:46:15,880 --> 02:46:18,200
What did you pick for the classic game of the week?

2932
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:20,200
I picked asteroids.

2933
02:46:21,480 --> 02:46:22,760
We're going old school with this.

2934
02:46:23,720 --> 02:46:28,360
So Asteroids is a multi-directional shooting game.

2935
02:46:28,360 --> 02:46:31,800
It was designed by Lyle Rains and Ed Log.

2936
02:46:31,800 --> 02:46:38,680
It was released in arcades in North America, November, 1979 by Atari.

2937
02:46:39,560 --> 02:46:46,200
You are a spaceship in an asteroid field, you have some flying saucers go by, but you

2938
02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:51,320
have to shoot and destroy the asteroids and the saucers while not colliding into either

2939
02:46:51,560 --> 02:46:53,320
or being hit in the crossfire.

2940
02:46:53,880 --> 02:46:57,480
And the game, of course, gets harder as you go.

2941
02:46:58,120 --> 02:47:03,720
This is considered to be one of the very first from the golden age of arcade games.

2942
02:47:04,360 --> 02:47:08,200
It sold over 70,000 arcade cabinets.

2943
02:47:09,400 --> 02:47:12,680
And it's been a hyper influential over the decades.

2944
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:19,800
And I would actually fifth dream says this is No Man's Sky Zero, right?

2945
02:47:19,800 --> 02:47:23,800
I'd say actually, probably without this one, we wouldn't have No Man's Sky.

2946
02:47:23,800 --> 02:47:25,080
We wouldn't have a lot of games.

2947
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:32,840
And indeed, this game was considered to be a direct influencer of Defender and Gravatar

2948
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:34,440
and a few other games.

2949
02:47:35,080 --> 02:47:43,000
So Asteroids was, they came up with it when Log and Rains used some of the hardware that

2950
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:50,680
was developed by Howard Delman that had been used on Lunar Lander to make a game and they

2951
02:47:50,680 --> 02:47:55,400
based it off an unfinished game called Cosmos using its physics model, the control scheme

2952
02:47:55,960 --> 02:48:01,400
and gameplay elements that also were from Spacewar!, Computer Space and Space Invaders

2953
02:48:01,400 --> 02:48:02,360
and they refined it.

2954
02:48:03,640 --> 02:48:10,840
The game is rendered on a vector display with a two dimensional view that wraps around both

2955
02:48:10,840 --> 02:48:11,640
screen axes.

2956
02:48:12,600 --> 02:48:20,200
So going into this, this is also one of those games that taught us how to exploit some of

2957
02:48:20,200 --> 02:48:24,920
the code in it because there's what's called a lurking exploit.

2958
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:31,800
So basically, the saucers were supposed to begin shooting when they appeared and it got

2959
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:32,200
changed.

2960
02:48:32,200 --> 02:48:36,600
And additionally, they could only aim at the player ship on screen and they are not able

2961
02:48:36,600 --> 02:48:39,000
to see beyond the game boundaries.

2962
02:48:39,080 --> 02:48:45,720
So you could lurk near the edge of the screen opposite the saucer and so basically it couldn't

2963
02:48:45,720 --> 02:48:46,200
shoot you.

2964
02:48:47,080 --> 02:48:57,240
They did put out, they have Atari patched the game, they patched the EPROM and removed the

2965
02:48:57,240 --> 02:48:57,800
exploits.

2966
02:48:57,800 --> 02:49:00,520
So here's also an early example of game patches.

2967
02:49:01,080 --> 02:49:13,640
But going back to the design of the game, basically, Log was really impressed with the

2968
02:49:14,760 --> 02:49:20,200
Atari video computer system, which was retitled to the Atari 2600.

2969
02:49:20,200 --> 02:49:23,800
And so he joined Atari's co-op division to work on Dirtbike.

2970
02:49:23,800 --> 02:49:25,160
It's a game that never came out.

2971
02:49:25,240 --> 02:49:30,120
It had an unsuccessful field test, also joined by Paul Mancuso.

2972
02:49:31,480 --> 02:49:37,720
He was on the development team as the asteroid's technician and engineer Howard Delman also

2973
02:49:39,320 --> 02:49:40,280
worked on the hardware.

2974
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:49,960
And so the other fella in this reigns discussed a game called Planet Grab, which is a multiplayer

2975
02:49:49,960 --> 02:49:52,680
arcade game that was renamed to Cosmos.

2976
02:49:55,560 --> 02:50:06,440
And basically it went from there and so basically it just ended up, well, actually the game

2977
02:50:06,440 --> 02:50:11,320
Cosmos that they had in its unfinished version, it had a giant indestructible asteroid.

2978
02:50:11,320 --> 02:50:16,040
And so Reigns asked Log, well, why don't we have a game where you shoot the rocks and

2979
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:16,840
blow them up?

2980
02:50:17,640 --> 02:50:19,000
And so the concept was born.

2981
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:22,680
It was developed as a vector game.

2982
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:28,280
So, of course, the lines are all drawn, the graphics are all drawn on a vector monitor.

2983
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:35,160
Although Reigns originally wanted it to be done in raster graphics, but Log wanted Vector

2984
02:50:36,200 --> 02:50:40,520
because it would allow more precise aiming and a higher quality image.

2985
02:50:40,520 --> 02:50:54,680
And so it's a modified MOS 6502 and QuadraScan, which is the high res vector processor that

2986
02:50:54,680 --> 02:50:56,120
Atari developed.

2987
02:50:56,120 --> 02:50:58,760
And it's referred to as an XY display system.

2988
02:50:58,760 --> 02:51:02,760
The digital vector generator is the other term.

2989
02:51:03,880 --> 02:51:10,120
So at any rate, they all came out of science and engineering, which was Atari's off campus

2990
02:51:10,120 --> 02:51:13,320
research lab in Grass Valley, which is not far from us.

2991
02:51:14,520 --> 02:51:14,920
Oh, wow.

2992
02:51:14,920 --> 02:51:16,520
I didn't realize it was there.

2993
02:51:16,520 --> 02:51:17,080
That's cool.

2994
02:51:17,720 --> 02:51:18,040
Yeah.

2995
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,560
And of course, that design was first used on Lunar Lander.

2996
02:51:22,600 --> 02:51:33,240
So the modified board had five buttons, 13 sound effects and additional RAM, and it was

2997
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:34,600
used to develop asteroids.

2998
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:38,920
The board itself is four by four inches linked up to a monitor.

2999
02:51:40,760 --> 02:51:51,880
So eventually, the prototype, once it existed, different members of the Atari staff, engineers

3000
02:51:51,880 --> 02:51:54,840
would just walk between labs and stop and play the game.

3001
02:51:55,640 --> 02:52:00,120
And people just were getting into it.

3002
02:52:00,120 --> 02:52:05,320
So Atari tested the game first in arcades.

3003
02:52:05,320 --> 02:52:06,120
Guess where, Rob?

3004
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:09,000
Also near here?

3005
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:09,880
Like here in Zach?

3006
02:52:09,880 --> 02:52:10,920
Sacramento.

3007
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:12,040
Wow, cool.

3008
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:14,680
There's a reason why I brought this up.

3009
02:52:16,120 --> 02:52:18,840
And they would basically watch people while they play it.

3010
02:52:21,640 --> 02:52:24,600
Players were...

3011
02:52:24,600 --> 02:52:28,200
I made a complaint they didn't get too much of a break in the game, especially those who

3012
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:29,560
were used to Space Invaders.

3013
02:52:30,360 --> 02:52:38,440
But what they did is they ended up just making little adjustments to the game.

3014
02:52:38,440 --> 02:52:42,920
So Atari will slow down as you gain 50 to 100 lives.

3015
02:52:43,480 --> 02:52:46,040
But there's no limit on the lives you display.

3016
02:52:46,040 --> 02:52:50,360
You can lose the game if more than 250 lives are collected.

3017
02:52:51,640 --> 02:52:53,800
So let's get on to the home versions.

3018
02:52:54,680 --> 02:53:00,520
Asteroids was released for the Atari VCS, AKA the Atari 2600, and the Atari 8-bit family

3019
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:02,680
of computers in 1981.

3020
02:53:03,400 --> 02:53:08,440
And then the Atari 7800 in 1986.

3021
02:53:08,440 --> 02:53:10,760
There was a port for the 5200.

3022
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:12,840
It was supposed to be just like the 8-bit version.

3023
02:53:13,880 --> 02:53:16,040
It was developed in 82 and not published.

3024
02:53:16,040 --> 02:53:19,640
And I do believe that we have a prototype of it.

3025
02:53:19,640 --> 02:53:20,280
One of the...

3026
02:53:20,280 --> 02:53:21,400
We released prototypes.

3027
02:53:22,440 --> 02:53:24,440
I mean, we've got two Atari 5200s.

3028
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:30,280
The 7800 version was a launch title and had co-op play.

3029
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:35,480
And Asteroids had colorful textures, but they did keep the heartbeat sound from the original.

3030
02:53:36,280 --> 02:53:48,280
And basically, though, the programmers who had to get it onto a 4 kilobyte cartridge

3031
02:53:50,040 --> 02:53:50,520
started...

3032
02:53:51,880 --> 02:53:56,520
When they worked on it, they basically made this game the first console to use bank switching.

3033
02:53:57,080 --> 02:54:01,880
So a technique that basically switches a ROM size from 4 kilobytes to 8 kilobytes.

3034
02:54:02,840 --> 02:54:05,000
This game was ridiculously popular.

3035
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:15,000
It displaced space invaders, had 70,000 units, earned about 150 million in sales from the game,

3036
02:54:15,640 --> 02:54:19,160
and a further 500 million in coin drops.

3037
02:54:19,320 --> 02:54:28,360
Basically, because it had been based on the Lunar Lander vector thing,

3038
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:30,360
it actually shipped in Lunar Lander cabinets.

3039
02:54:31,560 --> 02:54:39,240
And then they had to put larger coin boxes in the games to accommodate all the people

3040
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:42,520
who were spending money on it.

3041
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:54,680
It was the highest ranking game on the US replay amusement arcade charts in 1980.

3042
02:54:56,760 --> 02:55:02,280
And it became the highest grossing arcade video game of 1980 in the US after space invaders.

3043
02:55:04,600 --> 02:55:07,080
Now, here's the side thing, though.

3044
02:55:08,280 --> 02:55:09,720
Actually, let me go back a little bit more.

3045
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:20,280
They did an asteroid deluxe unit that also did fairly well,

3046
02:55:20,280 --> 02:55:25,720
but it was a failure in Japan when it was released in 1980 because of the complex controls.

3047
02:55:26,280 --> 02:55:29,800
And the Japanese market was losing interest in space shooters at the time.

3048
02:55:30,440 --> 02:55:33,960
I mean, I think they just came out of the whole space invaders

3049
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,480
huge craze that was causing the yen shortage.

3050
02:55:40,680 --> 02:55:45,720
But at any rate, it got really good ratings.

3051
02:55:45,720 --> 02:55:46,920
It was really fun.

3052
02:55:48,360 --> 02:55:53,240
It was one of the first games that tracked your initials and allow you to put in your high score.

3053
02:55:55,240 --> 02:55:57,320
It was praised for its vector graphics.

3054
02:55:58,200 --> 02:56:04,600
It was, in 1996, Next Generation listed as number 39 of their top 100 games of all years.

3055
02:56:04,600 --> 02:56:07,480
Retro Gamer put it in the top 25.

3056
02:56:08,440 --> 02:56:12,840
It was added to the Museum of Modern Art's collection of video games.

3057
02:56:13,800 --> 02:56:18,520
The Guardian listed Asteroids as the second greatest game of 1970, just below Galaxian.

3058
02:56:19,720 --> 02:56:27,560
And I mean, it's just got like all kinds of just accolades.

3059
02:56:27,560 --> 02:56:35,880
And also in Saturday Night Live, the characters of Mr. Bill and Sluggo were

3060
02:56:38,440 --> 02:56:44,600
they were referring to the saucers in an Esquire article.

3061
02:56:45,240 --> 02:56:52,840
And so, Lug got a cease and desist letters from a lawyer with the Mr. Bill trademark.

3062
02:56:53,720 --> 02:56:54,760
Very, very silly.

3063
02:56:56,680 --> 02:56:58,440
There were sequels.

3064
02:56:58,440 --> 02:57:05,800
1981, our Asteroids Deluxe came out and the enhancements were made by Dave Shepard

3065
02:57:05,800 --> 02:57:07,320
with Outlog's involvement.

3066
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:13,080
The objects were tinted blue, hyperspace replaced by a shield that depletes.

3067
02:57:14,040 --> 02:57:17,080
There's a killer satellite, had a holographic backdrop.

3068
02:57:18,120 --> 02:57:20,040
And then after that, there was Space Duel,

3069
02:57:21,320 --> 02:57:26,600
where the rocks were colorful geometric shapes and had co-op two player.

3070
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:32,280
And then a game that I have covered for a classic game was Blasteroids in 1987.

3071
02:57:32,280 --> 02:57:37,080
They had branching levels and bosses and docking your ships and multiplayer.

3072
02:57:38,520 --> 02:57:40,600
And it was raster graphics instead of vector.

3073
02:57:41,240 --> 02:57:45,720
So for re-releases on the Lynx, we had Super Asteroids and Missile Command.

3074
02:57:46,680 --> 02:57:51,880
Activision released it for many different series in their collections.

3075
02:57:53,400 --> 02:57:56,200
Crave did Asteroids Hyper 64.

3076
02:57:58,360 --> 02:58:01,320
There was a version for by, I think, for the Jaguar.

3077
02:58:02,680 --> 02:58:07,080
Just so many different like game room versions and mobile phone versions

3078
02:58:07,080 --> 02:58:13,560
and just all kinds that are a little bit too many to mention.

3079
02:58:13,560 --> 02:58:19,960
And then we had the clones because back in the day, it was all about send in the clones.

3080
02:58:21,640 --> 02:58:24,520
Quality Software did Asteroids in Space for the Apple II.

3081
02:58:26,360 --> 02:58:29,800
There were Appleoids was another one.

3082
02:58:29,880 --> 02:58:33,160
Mindstorm for the Vetrex, Acornsoft's meteors.

3083
02:58:33,160 --> 02:58:34,840
Moons of Jupiter for the VIC-20.

3084
02:58:35,800 --> 02:58:39,800
Planetoids for the TRS-80.

3085
02:58:41,240 --> 02:58:44,280
Meteor Storm for the Sinclair Zetec Spectrum.

3086
02:58:45,080 --> 02:58:51,000
And another very bad Asteroids clone for the VIC-20 was out there.

3087
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:54,280
There's also a Mattel Intellivision game meteor

3088
02:58:54,280 --> 02:58:59,160
that was canceled due to a lawsuit for Asteroids and was reworked as Astro Smash.

3089
02:59:00,200 --> 02:59:02,360
Um, world records.

3090
02:59:03,480 --> 02:59:04,600
Yeah, Twin Galaxies.

3091
02:59:04,600 --> 02:59:06,360
And I'm not going to go with Twin Galaxies, so whatever.

3092
02:59:07,480 --> 02:59:13,080
But I mean, think of all the other games that have come out that are kind of based on that.

3093
02:59:13,080 --> 02:59:16,600
I would wager like Geometry Wars, you know?

3094
02:59:16,600 --> 02:59:17,100
Oh, yeah.

3095
02:59:17,960 --> 02:59:24,920
And you know, one of my favorite games ever of on the ColecoVision is Space Fury.

3096
02:59:24,920 --> 02:59:30,600
One would argue that Space Fury was based off of Asteroids.

3097
02:59:30,600 --> 02:59:33,000
I would say it's definitely based off Asteroids.

3098
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:33,500
Yep.

3099
02:59:35,640 --> 02:59:38,360
Just all kinds of games like that, you know?

3100
02:59:38,360 --> 02:59:49,480
And like I was saying, this one paved the way for generations of space motion games, I would say.

3101
02:59:50,440 --> 02:59:59,080
You know, I think without Asteroids, it was the next big thing to push the industry.

3102
02:59:59,080 --> 03:00:03,000
And on top of that, again, it led to very, uh, you know, innovations that we take for

3103
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,400
granted today, like being able to put in your high score.

3104
03:00:06,120 --> 03:00:07,160
That was Asteroids.

3105
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:13,000
So, uh, I'm claiming that for Classic Game and I'm sticking to it.

3106
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,880
No, great pick for the Classic Game of the Week here on our

3107
03:00:16,520 --> 03:00:21,960
20th anniversary show, episode number 920, Asteroids, which many people in chat are kind

3108
03:00:21,960 --> 03:00:25,080
of lighting up saying, this is the first video game I remember playing.

3109
03:00:25,640 --> 03:00:28,680
So it's definitely, definitely a classic in that regard.

3110
03:00:29,480 --> 03:00:30,040
All right.

3111
03:00:30,040 --> 03:00:40,120
I, um, there is somewhere with a picture of me like four years old in like 1980 playing

3112
03:00:40,120 --> 03:00:43,160
an asteroid standing on a stool somewhere out there.

3113
03:00:43,800 --> 03:00:47,560
There's, there's a picture of me like that, but Crystal Castles is the game.

3114
03:00:49,080 --> 03:00:49,560
Yeah.

3115
03:00:49,560 --> 03:00:49,960
All right.

3116
03:00:51,080 --> 03:00:52,520
We're going to skip a couple of segments here.

3117
03:00:52,520 --> 03:00:55,560
We're going to skip our rapid fire news and our world release dates.

3118
03:00:55,560 --> 03:00:59,560
And we're just going to rip, uh, Bernie Stiller.

3119
03:01:00,120 --> 03:01:00,360
Yes.

3120
03:01:00,360 --> 03:01:00,600
Sorry.

3121
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:02,120
I forgot that was in rapid fire news tonight.

3122
03:01:02,680 --> 03:01:06,920
Um, let's take a look at the, uh, last few headlines here.

3123
03:01:06,920 --> 03:01:08,440
I think Loki, this first one was yours.

3124
03:01:09,160 --> 03:01:09,720
Yep.

3125
03:01:09,720 --> 03:01:14,440
So, uh, the X cloud stuff is getting mouse and keyboard support, which is pretty nice.

3126
03:01:15,400 --> 03:01:17,000
So that's the thing.

3127
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:17,160
Yeah.

3128
03:01:17,160 --> 03:01:18,120
I'm excited to try that.

3129
03:01:18,120 --> 03:01:18,620
That'd be great.

3130
03:01:19,320 --> 03:01:19,720
Yeah.

3131
03:01:19,720 --> 03:01:21,000
Uh, dark Sakura.

3132
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:25,240
I don't know if you can make this one short, but a study on child intelligence involving

3133
03:01:25,240 --> 03:01:25,740
games.

3134
03:01:26,760 --> 03:01:31,880
Um, basically a video games can boost child's intelligent TV and social media had no, uh,

3135
03:01:32,520 --> 03:01:33,960
effects in this way.

3136
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:38,440
Um, and intelligence is not a constant.

3137
03:01:39,080 --> 03:01:46,360
So it has to be, uh, judged in situational areas and ongoing for it to have a solid measure

3138
03:01:46,360 --> 03:01:46,680
of it.

3139
03:01:46,680 --> 03:01:49,400
So this, uh, study has been going on for a while.

3140
03:01:50,520 --> 03:01:54,040
Uh, Loki, this next one, this is kind of something I want to download and try.

3141
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:55,240
Yeah.

3142
03:01:55,240 --> 03:01:57,560
Unfortunately, you're probably not going to be able to do that unless you have a modded

3143
03:01:57,560 --> 03:02:04,200
switch system, but, um, some, some crafty modders have made super Mario Odyssey multiplayer.

3144
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:12,840
Um, and it is a 10 player mod that works on modded consoles, allows you to play with a

3145
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:13,720
bunch of people.

3146
03:02:13,720 --> 03:02:16,600
You can all, um, it's all synced together.

3147
03:02:16,600 --> 03:02:22,040
You can collect moons together and, uh, lots of different custom game modes.

3148
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:24,280
Nintendo will shut it down immediately.

3149
03:02:24,840 --> 03:02:29,000
This is really something that they should implement in the actual super Mario Odyssey

3150
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:30,760
game, but they'll never do it.

3151
03:02:31,720 --> 03:02:35,240
No, not at this point, but you know, if rumors are true that they're working on a Luigi

3152
03:02:35,240 --> 03:02:40,520
Odyssey or some type of super Mario Odyssey to, you know, listen up clearly fans want

3153
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:41,000
this, right?

3154
03:02:41,720 --> 03:02:43,080
Yeah, it'd be pretty cool.

3155
03:02:43,080 --> 03:02:47,320
Um, the last story, there was a lot of, uh, press things going around about Final Fantasy

3156
03:02:47,320 --> 03:02:48,680
16, this week's new interviews.

3157
03:02:48,680 --> 03:02:52,520
And one of them was confirmed that, um, Final Fantasy 16 will not be open world.

3158
03:02:52,520 --> 03:02:54,840
Um, but honestly, I don't think that's that big of a deal.

3159
03:02:54,840 --> 03:02:59,800
The only one that was open world was 15 and a lot of people didn't care for 15.

3160
03:02:59,800 --> 03:03:04,520
Um, and you know, if you look at 14, you know, for being in an MMO, it takes place

3161
03:03:04,520 --> 03:03:06,040
in segmented zones.

3162
03:03:06,040 --> 03:03:08,920
And that sounds a lot like what they have planned for 16.

3163
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:13,640
And at the end of the day, honest to God, creative business unit three fixed Final

3164
03:03:13,640 --> 03:03:18,120
Fantasy 14 and made it one of the greatest games out there right now, especially in the

3165
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:18,840
MMO space.

3166
03:03:19,640 --> 03:03:21,400
I'm just going to trust them.

3167
03:03:21,400 --> 03:03:25,720
If this is their creative decision for 16, if they've changed the combat so that you

3168
03:03:25,720 --> 03:03:29,000
only play one person and you do have a party, but you don't really use them.

3169
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:29,240
All right.

3170
03:03:29,240 --> 03:03:29,640
You know what?

3171
03:03:30,200 --> 03:03:31,240
I'm going to just hear it out.

3172
03:03:31,240 --> 03:03:35,000
I'm going to, I'm going to see what they bring to the table because, you know, 14 was so

3173
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:35,720
good.

3174
03:03:35,720 --> 03:03:40,600
I'm, I'm willing to give it a chance, but I'm just to see, say the bar, the bar is very

3175
03:03:40,600 --> 03:03:40,840
high.

3176
03:03:41,720 --> 03:03:46,280
Um, we are past the three hour mark tonight, so I'm going to beg that we roll over the,

3177
03:03:46,280 --> 03:03:49,320
um, Twitter and mailbag stuff to next week.

3178
03:03:49,320 --> 03:03:56,520
I will just say big, big thank you to, um, everybody who sent stuff in.

3179
03:03:56,520 --> 03:03:58,200
Uh, I saw the tweets.

3180
03:03:58,200 --> 03:04:01,720
A lot of you were very lovely on Twitter today, and I want to thank you for that.

3181
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:05,560
I didn't even consider that there were people that wanted to call in tonight.

3182
03:04:05,560 --> 03:04:06,200
Of course they do.

3183
03:04:06,200 --> 03:04:08,200
It's the 20th year and we always do Collins.

3184
03:04:08,200 --> 03:04:11,400
I'm going to, I'm going to do the two minute rule tonight.

3185
03:04:11,400 --> 03:04:13,160
We're doing quick phone calls tonight.

3186
03:04:13,160 --> 03:04:16,200
So you got to introduce yourself and say what you got to say.

3187
03:04:16,200 --> 03:04:17,480
So here we go.

3188
03:04:17,480 --> 03:04:18,920
I'm going to start bringing people in.

3189
03:04:18,920 --> 03:04:24,200
If you want to call in vognetwork.com and slash discord, excuse me, vognetwork.com

3190
03:04:24,200 --> 03:04:28,120
slash discord, and then you can join the green room.

3191
03:04:28,200 --> 03:04:31,400
We'll bring in our first contestant tonight.

3192
03:04:31,400 --> 03:04:31,800
Hi there.

3193
03:04:31,800 --> 03:04:32,760
You're on orange launch radio.

3194
03:04:32,760 --> 03:04:33,240
Who's this?

3195
03:04:36,680 --> 03:04:37,400
Hello there.

3196
03:04:37,400 --> 03:04:39,640
I don't know if you know, I just brought you in the room, but hi, you're on orange

3197
03:04:39,640 --> 03:04:40,040
launch radio.

3198
03:04:40,040 --> 03:04:40,520
Who's this?

3199
03:04:43,160 --> 03:04:43,640
Okay.

3200
03:04:43,640 --> 03:04:44,520
Oh, Nope.

3201
03:04:44,520 --> 03:04:45,000
They left.

3202
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:46,760
So we'll try bringing in someone else.

3203
03:04:46,760 --> 03:04:47,800
Let's try another contestant.

3204
03:04:47,800 --> 03:04:48,760
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

3205
03:04:48,760 --> 03:04:49,240
Who's this?

3206
03:04:49,960 --> 03:04:51,400
This is Brad from pod culture.

3207
03:04:51,400 --> 03:04:52,920
Hey, Brad from pod culture.

3208
03:04:52,920 --> 03:04:55,800
It's great to hear from you the two minute rules in effect tonight.

3209
03:04:55,800 --> 03:04:57,320
So what's on your mind real quick?

3210
03:04:58,840 --> 03:05:01,960
Just calling to say congratulations on 20, man.

3211
03:05:01,960 --> 03:05:02,920
Thank you so much.

3212
03:05:02,920 --> 03:05:05,560
And I know pod culture was a show.

3213
03:05:05,560 --> 03:05:08,040
You're named after a show that you had for a very long time.

3214
03:05:08,920 --> 03:05:13,960
That was no small spring chicken itself.

3215
03:05:13,960 --> 03:05:14,520
You know what I mean?

3216
03:05:14,520 --> 03:05:18,120
It had a great life.

3217
03:05:18,120 --> 03:05:19,080
I miss it, my friend.

3218
03:05:21,320 --> 03:05:27,480
Let's just say that well, OLR inspired kind of the early days of pod culture, and that's

3219
03:05:27,480 --> 03:05:28,360
why I was calling in.

3220
03:05:28,360 --> 03:05:33,080
It's you guys were a huge influence on how we set up the feel of our shows.

3221
03:05:33,080 --> 03:05:37,000
Just three or four friends sitting around shooting the shit about stuff that they like.

3222
03:05:39,720 --> 03:05:46,680
Let's just say there might be something in the works where we can all record virtually.

3223
03:05:46,680 --> 03:05:48,360
I will look forward to it.

3224
03:05:48,360 --> 03:05:48,760
Good luck.

3225
03:05:48,760 --> 03:05:49,320
Pod culture.

3226
03:05:49,320 --> 03:05:50,360
We'll look forward to seeing it.

3227
03:05:50,360 --> 03:05:51,240
Have a good one, my friend.

3228
03:05:51,800 --> 03:05:52,920
Happy anniversary, guys.

3229
03:05:52,920 --> 03:05:53,880
Thank you.

3230
03:05:53,880 --> 03:05:55,160
Thanks for being here all these years.

3231
03:05:55,160 --> 03:05:55,640
All right.

3232
03:05:55,640 --> 03:05:56,040
Bye bye.

3233
03:05:56,040 --> 03:05:56,280
Bye.

3234
03:05:56,760 --> 03:05:57,000
All right.

3235
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:00,760
Let's try to bring you one more real quick, and we'll see if this works this time.

3236
03:06:00,760 --> 03:06:01,720
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3237
03:06:01,720 --> 03:06:02,220
Who's this?

3238
03:06:03,960 --> 03:06:09,000
I think it's actually working this time because Discord decided to mute me when I had everything

3239
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:09,640
all set.

3240
03:06:09,640 --> 03:06:10,840
I mean, what the heck?

3241
03:06:10,840 --> 03:06:11,080
All right.

3242
03:06:11,080 --> 03:06:12,440
Well, the two minute rules in effect tonight.

3243
03:06:12,440 --> 03:06:13,560
So what's on your mind, my friend?

3244
03:06:13,560 --> 03:06:16,360
And it's great to hear and see you DJ Rama S.

3245
03:06:16,360 --> 03:06:17,000
I love your shirt.

3246
03:06:17,640 --> 03:06:17,880
All right.

3247
03:06:17,880 --> 03:06:18,280
Thank you.

3248
03:06:18,280 --> 03:06:21,880
I decided to wear this as an honor for 20 amazing years.

3249
03:06:22,760 --> 03:06:23,720
It's perfect.

3250
03:06:23,720 --> 03:06:24,200
I love it.

3251
03:06:25,160 --> 03:06:30,120
So I'm bringing back our tradition, and I'll make this as quick as possible.

3252
03:06:30,120 --> 03:06:34,280
So I have the first one for Loki.

3253
03:06:34,280 --> 03:06:34,780
I do it.

3254
03:06:35,720 --> 03:06:41,960
The straight man, the voice of reason, the angriest SOB when it comes to gaming.

3255
03:06:41,960 --> 03:06:45,880
So when he gets mad, you sit down, you shut up, and you listen.

3256
03:06:47,400 --> 03:06:49,400
And by the way, Ron must take it a shot.

3257
03:06:49,400 --> 03:06:51,400
And Bobby does have a good point.

3258
03:06:51,400 --> 03:06:53,160
If you're audio only, we don't know what's on the shirt.

3259
03:06:53,240 --> 03:06:54,280
What is on the shirt tonight?

3260
03:06:54,280 --> 03:06:55,720
It's like Sailor Moon fighting.

3261
03:06:56,440 --> 03:06:56,760
Yeah.

3262
03:06:56,760 --> 03:06:59,080
So we all know Marvel versus Capcom.

3263
03:06:59,080 --> 03:07:01,960
And what's popular are these cool types of T shirts.

3264
03:07:01,960 --> 03:07:06,840
This one is a parody of the Marvel versus Capcom fighting select screen, but it's all

3265
03:07:06,840 --> 03:07:11,400
the classic anime series from the 90s and 2000s.

3266
03:07:11,400 --> 03:07:17,960
So currently on my shirt, you have Kenshin Himuro from Rurouni Kenshin and Sailor Moon

3267
03:07:17,960 --> 03:07:21,080
going up against Hikaru from Magic Knight Ray Earth.

3268
03:07:21,080 --> 03:07:23,720
And Yusuke Urameshi from Yu Yu Hockey Show.

3269
03:07:23,720 --> 03:07:24,280
I'd love it.

3270
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:29,560
We do still call that out in my house from time to time.

3271
03:07:29,560 --> 03:07:31,800
You'll hear Dan just randomly call that out.

3272
03:07:32,840 --> 03:07:33,340
Oh, yeah?

3273
03:07:33,960 --> 03:07:35,400
Because I'm sorry.

3274
03:07:36,920 --> 03:07:37,160
Great.

3275
03:07:37,160 --> 03:07:37,880
Now I can't think of.

3276
03:07:39,720 --> 03:07:40,680
Quabra?

3277
03:07:40,680 --> 03:07:41,180
Yeah.

3278
03:07:41,640 --> 03:07:42,280
That was his guy.

3279
03:07:43,240 --> 03:07:45,400
I always have trouble trying to pronounce his name too.

3280
03:07:46,040 --> 03:07:48,680
No, I couldn't remember his name off the top of my head.

3281
03:07:48,680 --> 03:07:54,360
I was like, something like I'm having my two minute rule.

3282
03:07:54,360 --> 03:07:56,040
And Rama's got some more toast to do.

3283
03:07:56,040 --> 03:07:56,680
I'm sorry.

3284
03:07:56,680 --> 03:07:57,560
I have to be that guy.

3285
03:07:57,560 --> 03:08:01,800
But we're long to this one for Jamie Dark Sakura.

3286
03:08:01,800 --> 03:08:04,680
And I say this in the most lovingly way of possible.

3287
03:08:04,680 --> 03:08:06,280
The head bitch in charge.

3288
03:08:06,280 --> 03:08:09,560
When you hear her talk, if you don't listen, that's your ass.

3289
03:08:11,400 --> 03:08:12,120
Love you bestie.

3290
03:08:12,760 --> 03:08:13,260
Salut.

3291
03:08:14,760 --> 03:08:15,260
L'chaim.

3292
03:08:16,040 --> 03:08:16,540
L'chaim.

3293
03:08:17,320 --> 03:08:22,280
And to Rob, the sassiest motherfucker I have ever met.

3294
03:08:23,400 --> 03:08:23,900
Thank you.

3295
03:08:24,760 --> 03:08:26,840
When you speak, we listen.

3296
03:08:27,880 --> 03:08:31,400
Because the show has become, we just come out and hang out

3297
03:08:31,400 --> 03:08:33,720
and we talk and we have a damn good time.

3298
03:08:33,720 --> 03:08:37,160
So Rob, thanks for everything.

3299
03:08:37,160 --> 03:08:39,320
The fish, the whole nine yards.

3300
03:08:39,320 --> 03:08:41,080
And I remember having a cup like that.

3301
03:08:42,120 --> 03:08:42,760
I adore you.

3302
03:08:44,360 --> 03:08:45,000
The last one.

3303
03:08:45,880 --> 03:08:46,920
Oh, please trust.

3304
03:08:47,480 --> 03:08:48,360
Here's to you.

3305
03:08:48,360 --> 03:08:49,080
Here's to me.

3306
03:08:49,080 --> 03:08:50,600
The best of friends will ever be.

3307
03:08:50,600 --> 03:08:52,120
If we should ever happen to disagree.

3308
03:08:52,120 --> 03:08:53,320
Well, then fuck you.

3309
03:08:53,320 --> 03:08:53,880
And here's to me.

3310
03:08:57,000 --> 03:09:00,120
And now I must bid adieu because I have to get up at 7 a.m.

3311
03:09:00,120 --> 03:09:00,600
For work.

3312
03:09:00,600 --> 03:09:02,360
So good night, Joe.

3313
03:09:02,360 --> 03:09:03,160
Good night, Rama.

3314
03:09:03,880 --> 03:09:04,600
Party without you.

3315
03:09:06,120 --> 03:09:08,920
Anime Jam session, Tuesday nights, 9 p.m.

3316
03:09:08,920 --> 03:09:09,320
Eastern.

3317
03:09:09,320 --> 03:09:09,880
See you then.

3318
03:09:09,880 --> 03:09:10,380
Bye.

3319
03:09:10,760 --> 03:09:11,260
Bye.

3320
03:09:11,260 --> 03:09:11,880
I love this.

3321
03:09:11,880 --> 03:09:12,200
All right.

3322
03:09:12,760 --> 03:09:16,040
Let's just to play the music like the Oscars.

3323
03:09:16,040 --> 03:09:16,920
Pull in a few more.

3324
03:09:16,920 --> 03:09:17,320
Yeah, I know.

3325
03:09:17,320 --> 03:09:17,560
Right.

3326
03:09:17,560 --> 03:09:20,600
Swell the music up as we give people the hook.

3327
03:09:20,600 --> 03:09:21,800
Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio.

3328
03:09:21,800 --> 03:09:22,280
Who's this?

3329
03:09:23,400 --> 03:09:24,760
Hey, this is Mike Deft.

3330
03:09:24,760 --> 03:09:25,560
Mike Deft.

3331
03:09:25,560 --> 03:09:26,440
It's good to hear from you.

3332
03:09:27,560 --> 03:09:29,960
As you know, the two minute rules in effect tonight.

3333
03:09:29,960 --> 03:09:32,200
But it's great to hear what's on your mind.

3334
03:09:32,200 --> 03:09:33,480
I'm going to keep it short.

3335
03:09:33,480 --> 03:09:37,480
And again, I want to thank you or congratulate you first

3336
03:09:37,480 --> 03:09:39,400
for the 20th anniversary.

3337
03:09:40,040 --> 03:09:48,600
And also thank you, each one of you, because, yeah, it's been an amazing 20 years for you.

3338
03:09:49,480 --> 03:09:54,360
I'm obviously haven't been 20 years here, but something I said earlier.

3339
03:09:54,360 --> 03:09:55,880
It feels like you've been here since the beginning.

3340
03:09:55,880 --> 03:09:57,400
But I mean that as a compliment.

3341
03:09:57,400 --> 03:09:57,880
I hope you know.

3342
03:09:58,520 --> 03:09:58,760
Yeah.

3343
03:09:59,400 --> 03:10:05,240
But something I said in chat earlier that the best compliment you can get is basically

3344
03:10:06,200 --> 03:10:10,920
the inspiration you set on other people to do their own thing.

3345
03:10:11,720 --> 03:10:21,000
And I really want to emphasize in that, that if your grandma is doing his podcast,

3346
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:25,960
if I'm doing my podcast, so many people who have inspired over the years.

3347
03:10:25,960 --> 03:10:29,480
And I'm really thankful for being part of our lives.

3348
03:10:30,120 --> 03:10:31,640
Like, it's been amazing.

3349
03:10:31,640 --> 03:10:38,360
And hopefully you can keep doing this at least for a long time, or at least a few years more.

3350
03:10:38,360 --> 03:10:42,040
And again, thanks so much for all you do.

3351
03:10:42,760 --> 03:10:43,800
Thank you so much.

3352
03:10:43,800 --> 03:10:46,920
It truly is the greatest compliment.

3353
03:10:46,920 --> 03:10:49,160
And I said, I'm not going to cry tonight.

3354
03:10:49,160 --> 03:10:50,440
I'm not going to do it.

3355
03:10:50,440 --> 03:10:52,120
But thank you so much for that.

3356
03:10:52,120 --> 03:10:53,160
We can cry, Rob.

3357
03:10:53,160 --> 03:10:54,760
I know, but I'm not going to.

3358
03:10:56,680 --> 03:10:58,040
Do you have no tears left to cry?

3359
03:10:58,040 --> 03:11:01,400
No, by the way, who also shares my birthday today?

3360
03:11:02,200 --> 03:11:02,280
Ariana Grande.

3361
03:11:02,280 --> 03:11:02,920
Thank you very much.

3362
03:11:02,920 --> 03:11:03,960
I'm so honored.

3363
03:11:03,960 --> 03:11:04,280
All right.

3364
03:11:04,280 --> 03:11:05,800
I have Tim Curry, though.

3365
03:11:05,800 --> 03:11:07,720
Deft with the GFM cast.

3366
03:11:07,720 --> 03:11:10,600
Or should I say, hey, F-A-M-A cast, right?

3367
03:11:10,600 --> 03:11:11,000
I say that right.

3368
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:12,200
Hey, F-A-M-A cast.

3369
03:11:12,200 --> 03:11:12,600
Awesome.

3370
03:11:13,080 --> 03:11:13,720
All right.

3371
03:11:13,720 --> 03:11:14,120
Enjoy.

3372
03:11:14,680 --> 03:11:16,520
It's all in Spanish, though.

3373
03:11:16,520 --> 03:11:18,920
So it helps to be able to speak the language.

3374
03:11:18,920 --> 03:11:24,600
I would love to come on your show if I could hang with the language, but I could do a bumper.

3375
03:11:24,600 --> 03:11:26,360
I got Google Translate.

3376
03:11:28,120 --> 03:11:28,440
All right.

3377
03:11:29,080 --> 03:11:29,960
That would be awesome.

3378
03:11:29,960 --> 03:11:30,280
All right.

3379
03:11:30,280 --> 03:11:30,920
Take care, Deft.

3380
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:31,720
It's great to hear from you.

3381
03:11:32,680 --> 03:11:33,160
Thanks.

3382
03:11:33,160 --> 03:11:33,400
All right.

3383
03:11:33,400 --> 03:11:33,900
Bye-bye.

3384
03:11:34,920 --> 03:11:35,560
All right.

3385
03:11:35,560 --> 03:11:36,520
We got a couple more.

3386
03:11:36,520 --> 03:11:37,160
Last chance.

3387
03:11:37,160 --> 03:11:39,400
Get you a butt in the green room if you want to call in.

3388
03:11:39,400 --> 03:11:41,080
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

3389
03:11:41,080 --> 03:11:41,580
Who's this?

3390
03:11:42,760 --> 03:11:43,880
Hey, this is YYR.

3391
03:11:43,880 --> 03:11:45,080
Hey, YYR.

3392
03:11:45,080 --> 03:11:46,280
It's good to hear from you.

3393
03:11:46,280 --> 03:11:46,760
What's up?

3394
03:11:46,760 --> 03:11:47,160
I'm sorry.

3395
03:11:47,160 --> 03:11:49,160
The two-minute rule is in effect tonight, though.

3396
03:11:49,160 --> 03:11:50,280
Oh, that is just fine.

3397
03:11:50,280 --> 03:11:52,680
I know this is difficult, but you have to keep it short.

3398
03:11:52,680 --> 03:11:53,960
What's on your mind?

3399
03:11:53,960 --> 03:11:54,600
I do.

3400
03:11:54,600 --> 03:11:55,400
I will.

3401
03:11:55,400 --> 03:11:58,520
Listen, first, I just want to say.

3402
03:11:58,520 --> 03:11:59,020
Right.

3403
03:11:59,480 --> 03:12:04,360
Congratulations on 20 years, and I just want to also say thank you.

3404
03:12:05,400 --> 03:12:12,520
I had no idea that when this, you know, a friend of mine named Matt, who you all know as SSJ100Matt,

3405
03:12:13,320 --> 03:12:19,960
told me about this podcast all the way back in 2008 and said, hey, you know, maybe you

3406
03:12:19,960 --> 03:12:22,680
could plug your game Snake 360 on there.

3407
03:12:22,680 --> 03:12:27,960
I had no idea that this would be the start of a beautiful relationship and also just,

3408
03:12:27,960 --> 03:12:32,040
you know, it's entertaining to listen to you guys week in and week out.

3409
03:12:32,040 --> 03:12:33,080
So thank you.

3410
03:12:33,080 --> 03:12:34,440
I really appreciate that.

3411
03:12:35,800 --> 03:12:40,840
But actually, I just wanted to mention, because, you know, a few of the things that have been

3412
03:12:40,840 --> 03:12:44,520
said on the show have led to me creating games.

3413
03:12:45,880 --> 03:12:52,600
And a few times, I've heard something, and my immediate reaction was, I have to do that.

3414
03:12:53,240 --> 03:13:00,360
There is one outstanding moment on this show that I had that reaction to that I have not

3415
03:13:00,360 --> 03:13:04,600
been able to make good on yet, and I figured, hopefully, it'll come through my mic.

3416
03:13:04,600 --> 03:13:06,600
I would like to go ahead and play it.

3417
03:13:07,480 --> 03:13:13,640
It is way back from episode 775 that took place in 2019.

3418
03:13:14,600 --> 03:13:22,840
This part immediately happened after, Rob, you introduced a story about Platinum Games,

3419
03:13:22,840 --> 03:13:27,560
and they were mentioning that they had a couple of projects in development that were too early

3420
03:13:27,560 --> 03:13:33,320
to announce, but they promised they were like nothing that had ever come before, to which

3421
03:13:33,320 --> 03:13:34,440
Loki replied,

3422
03:14:04,120 --> 03:14:09,400
Please, please do not say you are surprise announcing Wrecked Gun here on the show.

3423
03:14:10,600 --> 03:14:15,320
I have nothing to announce yet, but I promise it will be like nothing you've ever seen before.

3424
03:14:17,480 --> 03:14:18,520
Or want to see.

3425
03:14:21,800 --> 03:14:26,200
And with that, I say congratulations once again, and I will bid you adieu.

3426
03:14:27,080 --> 03:14:32,440
You make dreams a reality here at Orange Launch Radio, and I really can't thank you enough,

3427
03:14:33,080 --> 03:14:40,200
even though I'm really about to cuss you out, so I'm going to let you go.

3428
03:14:41,880 --> 03:14:43,800
Have a great night and a great week.

3429
03:14:43,800 --> 03:14:44,280
Take care.

3430
03:14:44,280 --> 03:14:47,480
At least it's not like Gatling cock or something.

3431
03:14:48,040 --> 03:14:49,000
Oh my God.

3432
03:14:50,200 --> 03:14:54,040
We said that on episode 775, and that man remembered.

3433
03:14:54,040 --> 03:14:59,880
Do not blow it out your ass.

3434
03:14:59,880 --> 03:15:00,380
Literally.

3435
03:15:02,040 --> 03:15:03,720
I see it's a very correct.

3436
03:15:04,680 --> 03:15:06,600
Okay, we still have a couple more calls.

3437
03:15:06,600 --> 03:15:07,640
Let's get you and I love it.

3438
03:15:07,640 --> 03:15:10,040
These are names I don't get to see very often, so let's do it.

3439
03:15:10,040 --> 03:15:11,480
Let's bring in another caller.

3440
03:15:11,480 --> 03:15:13,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3441
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:13,500
Who's this?

3442
03:15:17,080 --> 03:15:19,160
Oh, oh, hi.

3443
03:15:19,160 --> 03:15:20,280
Hi, it's Orange, right?

3444
03:15:20,280 --> 03:15:20,760
You're here.

3445
03:15:20,760 --> 03:15:21,720
Hey, Orange, right?

3446
03:15:21,720 --> 03:15:22,840
It's good to hear from you.

3447
03:15:22,840 --> 03:15:24,440
I don't think we hear from you a lot.

3448
03:15:26,600 --> 03:15:27,240
Sorry about that.

3449
03:15:28,040 --> 03:15:29,400
No, I know it's very jarring.

3450
03:15:29,400 --> 03:15:30,280
It's like you're sitting in a room.

3451
03:15:31,400 --> 03:15:32,120
This kind of thing.

3452
03:15:33,560 --> 03:15:39,800
I'm watching the Twitch feed and the Discord at the same time, so it's all good.

3453
03:15:39,800 --> 03:15:40,360
All good.

3454
03:15:40,360 --> 03:15:41,960
Well, what is on your mind tonight, my friend?

3455
03:15:41,960 --> 03:15:45,160
Unfortunately, the two minute rules in effect tonight, so I got to keep it quick.

3456
03:15:45,160 --> 03:15:45,660
What's up?

3457
03:15:46,520 --> 03:15:46,840
All right.

3458
03:15:46,840 --> 03:15:52,040
I just wanted to I wish I came in with a real question, but I just wanted to say congratulations

3459
03:15:52,040 --> 03:15:59,240
on the 20 years and thank you for making my Sunday nights that much more special.

3460
03:16:00,040 --> 03:16:01,000
Thank you for being here.

3461
03:16:01,560 --> 03:16:05,320
It wouldn't be so fun if we didn't have the chat room and you've been a huge presence

3462
03:16:05,320 --> 03:16:09,720
in our chat room with your insightful comments and you've got a very rich knowledge about

3463
03:16:09,720 --> 03:16:13,800
a lot of games and you do a lot of live fact checking on the show and I appreciate that.

3464
03:16:14,680 --> 03:16:17,880
It's better to fact check live than get the email the next week.

3465
03:16:17,880 --> 03:16:19,800
Boy, you guys really fucked up that one story.

3466
03:16:19,960 --> 03:16:25,160
It's so nice to have that live and just super appreciate that, my friend.

3467
03:16:26,040 --> 03:16:26,920
Thank you.

3468
03:16:26,920 --> 03:16:27,480
All right.

3469
03:16:27,480 --> 03:16:31,400
Well, Orange Wright, you take care and I hope we hear from you again when we're not running

3470
03:16:31,400 --> 03:16:32,120
three and a half hours.

3471
03:16:32,840 --> 03:16:33,160
All right.

3472
03:16:33,720 --> 03:16:34,760
Take care, my friend.

3473
03:16:34,760 --> 03:16:35,240
Bye bye.

3474
03:16:37,080 --> 03:16:40,760
So I'm intentionally leaving someone in there to be last.

3475
03:16:40,760 --> 03:16:46,440
So just to be clear, I'm not purposely pulling it.

3476
03:16:46,440 --> 03:16:48,760
I'm not purposely letting people jump the line.

3477
03:16:48,760 --> 03:16:51,560
I'm purposely letting having one person have the last word.

3478
03:16:51,560 --> 03:16:54,600
We have another call coming in, though, so let's get to it.

3479
03:16:54,600 --> 03:16:55,160
Hello.

3480
03:16:55,160 --> 03:16:56,200
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3481
03:16:56,200 --> 03:16:56,600
Who's this?

3482
03:16:59,240 --> 03:17:05,560
Okay, you might be muted or you're just not realizing we picked you up on Discord yet.

3483
03:17:10,600 --> 03:17:11,000
Hello.

3484
03:17:11,640 --> 03:17:12,120
Hola.

3485
03:17:12,120 --> 03:17:14,360
Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

3486
03:17:16,280 --> 03:17:16,760
Okay.

3487
03:17:16,840 --> 03:17:18,760
We're having some mic trouble.

3488
03:17:18,760 --> 03:17:19,560
Yeah.

3489
03:17:19,560 --> 03:17:22,760
Hey, call us next week because I would love to hear from you.

3490
03:17:23,880 --> 03:17:27,320
All right, let's get to the last call.

3491
03:17:28,760 --> 03:17:29,320
This is it.

3492
03:17:31,160 --> 03:17:32,680
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3493
03:17:32,680 --> 03:17:33,160
Who's this?

3494
03:17:36,360 --> 03:17:38,920
No, don't tell me they don't know their mics on or not here.

3495
03:17:38,920 --> 03:17:39,560
Hello.

3496
03:17:39,560 --> 03:17:40,760
If you hear me, you're on the air.

3497
03:17:40,760 --> 03:17:48,200
Ah, I don't know how to.

3498
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:49,560
What are we?

3499
03:17:49,560 --> 03:17:51,640
Are we doing something wrong where, like, people don't know?

3500
03:17:51,640 --> 03:17:53,960
Like, it's probably not like beeping or something like that.

3501
03:17:53,960 --> 03:17:55,560
So let me see.

3502
03:17:58,920 --> 03:18:01,480
I'm gonna just ping them in chat, see if they.

3503
03:18:04,120 --> 03:18:05,320
He's not muted.

3504
03:18:05,320 --> 03:18:07,080
No, it's not muted on Discord.

3505
03:18:07,080 --> 03:18:08,120
Unless it's a hard mute.

3506
03:18:08,120 --> 03:18:10,200
So for whatever reason, the mic isn't picking it up.

3507
03:18:11,480 --> 03:18:13,080
All right.

3508
03:18:14,360 --> 03:18:14,760
You know what?

3509
03:18:15,960 --> 03:18:18,520
We have a return.

3510
03:18:19,640 --> 03:18:21,960
We are going to deposit you back in the green room and try

3511
03:18:21,960 --> 03:18:22,520
one more time.

3512
03:18:23,720 --> 03:18:24,200
Okay.

3513
03:18:24,200 --> 03:18:26,200
Meanwhile, let's try this.

3514
03:18:26,200 --> 03:18:27,320
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3515
03:18:27,320 --> 03:18:27,820
Who's this?

3516
03:18:28,280 --> 03:18:29,480
This is Drew.

3517
03:18:29,480 --> 03:18:29,960
Drew.

3518
03:18:29,960 --> 03:18:31,160
It's good to hear from you.

3519
03:18:31,160 --> 03:18:31,960
You got it to work.

3520
03:18:31,960 --> 03:18:33,320
What's up, my friend?

3521
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:37,640
What'd you say?

3522
03:18:37,640 --> 03:18:39,720
Haven't seen you in a long time.

3523
03:18:40,760 --> 03:18:42,920
Thank God we're in a virtual environment now.

3524
03:18:42,920 --> 03:18:45,320
So you can't break anything.

3525
03:18:47,400 --> 03:18:48,680
That you know of.

3526
03:18:48,680 --> 03:18:49,880
I'm breaking hearts every day.

3527
03:18:49,880 --> 03:18:50,680
What are you talking about?

3528
03:18:51,480 --> 03:18:54,120
Drew, I have to ask you something, and I don't want to hear

3529
03:18:54,120 --> 03:18:57,080
the answer to this, but I'm gonna ask this question anyway,

3530
03:18:57,080 --> 03:18:58,360
and I'm gonna be very upset.

3531
03:18:59,320 --> 03:19:00,280
How old are you now?

3532
03:19:02,680 --> 03:19:05,000
Just a little less older than the show.

3533
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:05,640
No, I'm kidding.

3534
03:19:07,080 --> 03:19:08,360
Do you really want the answer?

3535
03:19:09,080 --> 03:19:10,280
Unfortunately, yes.

3536
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:15,800
Ah, I share a birthday with good old Orange Lounge Radio.

3537
03:19:15,800 --> 03:19:17,320
So I am now 37.

3538
03:19:18,440 --> 03:19:18,760
Row.

3539
03:19:22,840 --> 03:19:23,160
Hello.

3540
03:19:23,160 --> 03:19:23,480
Hello.

3541
03:19:25,480 --> 03:19:27,560
Yes, in a total row.

3542
03:19:27,560 --> 03:19:28,840
Yes, there you go.

3543
03:19:28,840 --> 03:19:30,680
And he's going to be in a total row about it.

3544
03:19:32,120 --> 03:19:35,720
I remember this kid was like 21 the first time he came on

3545
03:19:35,720 --> 03:19:36,200
OLR.

3546
03:19:36,920 --> 03:19:37,800
Oh, Jesus.

3547
03:19:37,800 --> 03:19:39,880
I was younger than that when you were.

3548
03:19:42,760 --> 03:19:47,000
Oh, you have made those so much progress, and I'm ridiculously

3549
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:47,560
proud of you.

3550
03:19:48,680 --> 03:19:50,920
All right, you have.

3551
03:19:50,920 --> 03:19:52,360
Good God, you've come a long way.

3552
03:19:54,520 --> 03:19:55,240
And I got the right.

3553
03:19:57,800 --> 03:19:59,240
So let me ask this.

3554
03:19:59,240 --> 03:20:00,280
The two minute rules in effect.

3555
03:20:00,280 --> 03:20:00,760
I'm so sorry.

3556
03:20:00,760 --> 03:20:02,520
I'd love to talk to you longer, but quickly.

3557
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:08,040
What do you want to tell people about the old days of OLR?

3558
03:20:08,040 --> 03:20:09,800
Because believe it or not, we have a lot of newer listeners

3559
03:20:09,800 --> 03:20:10,520
because of Twitch and all that.

3560
03:20:10,520 --> 03:20:13,560
So not everybody was here back in the Rob's Garage day and

3561
03:20:13,560 --> 03:20:14,520
things like that.

3562
03:20:14,520 --> 03:20:17,080
What's like a memory from the old OLR, something people

3563
03:20:17,080 --> 03:20:17,800
should know about it?

3564
03:20:18,680 --> 03:20:19,480
Oh, my God.

3565
03:20:20,920 --> 03:20:26,120
If there's any one mascot there that screams OLR or rather

3566
03:20:26,120 --> 03:20:28,760
chirps OLR, it is that old bush baby ferret.

3567
03:20:29,720 --> 03:20:32,840
And I know it's been a very, very, very long time since

3568
03:20:32,840 --> 03:20:34,680
that same thing has been on the airwaves.

3569
03:20:36,840 --> 03:20:40,120
That thing doesn't even work anymore, but I have it.

3570
03:20:40,120 --> 03:20:41,720
It ended up in a wood chipper.

3571
03:20:41,720 --> 03:20:44,120
No, it was this little thing that made a noise that said,

3572
03:20:44,120 --> 03:20:44,760
Excuse me.

3573
03:20:45,320 --> 03:20:48,520
No, because Loki found like a store that had like five more.

3574
03:20:48,520 --> 03:20:51,080
And I remember he dumped a whole box out one episode.

3575
03:20:51,080 --> 03:20:54,120
I think Angel or one of our other fans took one.

3576
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:57,240
One of them got on the Grotto Mori.

3577
03:20:57,240 --> 03:20:57,960
Oh, yeah, that's right.

3578
03:20:57,960 --> 03:21:00,680
One of them got stuck on the Katamari at E3 that one year.

3579
03:21:00,680 --> 03:21:02,040
That was fucking funny.

3580
03:21:02,040 --> 03:21:03,960
So at E3, they were hyping.

3581
03:21:03,960 --> 03:21:06,840
I think the sequel was like beautiful Katamari or one of

3582
03:21:06,840 --> 03:21:09,320
those games, and they actually had a Katamari you could stick

3583
03:21:09,320 --> 03:21:09,880
things to.

3584
03:21:09,880 --> 03:21:13,480
And one of those ferrets ended up on the fucking Katamari

3585
03:21:13,480 --> 03:21:14,760
they had at E3.

3586
03:21:14,760 --> 03:21:17,160
That's probably sitting in a Namco office somewhere now or

3587
03:21:17,160 --> 03:21:17,720
a dumpster.

3588
03:21:17,720 --> 03:21:18,220
Who knows?

3589
03:21:19,160 --> 03:21:22,280
But just in case y'all thought that everybody was entirely

3590
03:21:22,280 --> 03:21:24,920
serious all the time, even back then, ferrets.

3591
03:21:25,240 --> 03:21:26,600
Every time.

3592
03:21:27,720 --> 03:21:29,880
Check out Bungie Ferret Tossing on 360.

3593
03:21:29,880 --> 03:21:31,160
Somebody made a game about that.

3594
03:21:31,160 --> 03:21:33,480
Just I don't know if you were here for that, but it's pretty

3595
03:21:33,480 --> 03:21:36,120
wild how things came full circle.

3596
03:21:36,120 --> 03:21:37,080
You have a hand in that?

3597
03:21:38,200 --> 03:21:39,560
No, this is all YYR.

3598
03:21:40,760 --> 03:21:43,560
I think we might have done voices or something, but there's

3599
03:21:43,560 --> 03:21:46,840
pictures of our pets in there that sadly, some of them have

3600
03:21:46,840 --> 03:21:47,480
left this realm.

3601
03:21:47,480 --> 03:21:49,640
But yeah, because it's kind of an older game at this point.

3602
03:21:50,680 --> 03:21:53,000
All right, Drew, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up.

3603
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:54,760
We're seriously at the three and a half hour point.

3604
03:21:55,160 --> 03:21:55,960
Take care, my friend.

3605
03:21:56,760 --> 03:21:57,160
You too.

3606
03:21:57,160 --> 03:21:58,280
Congratulations, y'all.

3607
03:21:58,280 --> 03:21:58,760
Thank you.

3608
03:21:58,760 --> 03:21:59,160
Thanks.

3609
03:21:59,160 --> 03:22:00,280
Thanks for being a part of it.

3610
03:22:00,920 --> 03:22:01,480
Take care.

3611
03:22:01,480 --> 03:22:02,920
Proud to be real.

3612
03:22:04,120 --> 03:22:05,000
37.

3613
03:22:07,160 --> 03:22:08,040
37.

3614
03:22:11,080 --> 03:22:14,040
Let's try one more time with this last caller tonight.

3615
03:22:14,040 --> 03:22:14,600
Hello.

3616
03:22:14,600 --> 03:22:16,760
You are on Orange Lawn's radio.

3617
03:22:16,760 --> 03:22:17,240
Who's this?

3618
03:22:20,520 --> 03:22:22,440
Oh, no, I think it's still broken.

3619
03:22:22,440 --> 03:22:26,440
And I just I don't know if this individual can hear us.

3620
03:22:26,440 --> 03:22:28,920
It's a bummer, because back in the Skype days, we used to say

3621
03:22:28,920 --> 03:22:31,000
call Echo 123 to test your connection.

3622
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:32,920
There's nothing like that on Discord, so we kind of have to

3623
03:22:32,920 --> 03:22:34,440
figure this stuff out live.

3624
03:22:34,440 --> 03:22:38,600
So I'm going to try one more time.

3625
03:22:40,280 --> 03:22:43,880
See if this person can, because I don't know if Discord

3626
03:22:43,880 --> 03:22:45,640
always beeps in your ear.

3627
03:22:45,640 --> 03:22:49,080
So if you and what I'm worried people might be doing is that

3628
03:22:49,080 --> 03:22:54,440
they're muting Discord and listening on Twitch.

3629
03:22:54,440 --> 03:22:57,000
And so they don't hear that they got brought into the room.

3630
03:22:57,560 --> 03:22:59,960
Oh, the camera's switching.

3631
03:22:59,960 --> 03:23:03,000
So maybe it's getting figured out.

3632
03:23:05,240 --> 03:23:05,800
Who knows?

3633
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:09,800
But Bobby says they do have Discord settings to test your

3634
03:23:09,800 --> 03:23:12,600
device. It records and it plays audio back to you.

3635
03:23:15,560 --> 03:23:17,560
My heart is breaking, but I don't think it's working.

3636
03:23:18,520 --> 03:23:22,280
It's just we're getting the spinning hourglass wheel.

3637
03:23:23,400 --> 03:23:25,880
Man. Bummer.

3638
03:23:27,080 --> 03:23:27,960
All right.

3639
03:23:27,960 --> 03:23:29,240
I'm sorry, Dark Tetsuya.

3640
03:23:29,240 --> 03:23:31,880
I would love to hear from you and let you have the final word.

3641
03:23:31,880 --> 03:23:32,840
Oh, it's trying one more time.

3642
03:23:33,640 --> 03:23:35,000
I'm worried if it even gets through.

3643
03:23:37,240 --> 03:23:37,480
No.

3644
03:23:39,320 --> 03:23:40,280
I see it spinning.

3645
03:23:40,280 --> 03:23:41,080
It hating.

3646
03:23:41,080 --> 03:23:41,880
Yeah, it's hating.

3647
03:23:41,880 --> 03:23:43,320
I'm sorry, Dark Tetsuya.

3648
03:23:43,320 --> 03:23:45,720
Yeah, he said his internet wasn't working right properly

3649
03:23:45,800 --> 03:23:49,880
either, but I'm sure you understand it is live radio and

3650
03:23:49,880 --> 03:23:50,920
we've got to wrap it up.

3651
03:23:50,920 --> 03:23:52,120
We're at the three and a half hour mark.

3652
03:23:52,120 --> 03:23:55,000
Please send in your thoughts and just know I saved you for

3653
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:56,920
last because I know you've been here since the very first

3654
03:23:56,920 --> 03:23:59,080
episode. I wanted you to be the final voice tonight.

3655
03:23:59,640 --> 03:24:02,840
It's a bummer technology sucks, but thank you for all that

3656
03:24:02,840 --> 03:24:05,000
you've done over the years for us, my friend.

3657
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:07,240
And we'll see you next week.

3658
03:24:07,240 --> 03:24:08,760
I hope we see everybody next week.

3659
03:24:08,760 --> 03:24:12,120
I know we've had a long, long show tonight, but we've had a

3660
03:24:12,120 --> 03:24:13,560
long history.

3661
03:24:14,360 --> 03:24:19,240
It's been 20 years of this, and thank you all for your

3662
03:24:19,240 --> 03:24:19,640
support.

3663
03:24:20,360 --> 03:24:21,320
I can't even.

3664
03:24:21,320 --> 03:24:21,640
I know.

3665
03:24:21,640 --> 03:24:22,280
I can't even.

3666
03:24:22,280 --> 03:24:25,560
It's one of those things where, like, I can't even like

3667
03:24:25,560 --> 03:24:27,720
I hear, Oh, we've been going for 20 years.

3668
03:24:27,720 --> 03:24:30,600
I have a hard time even, like, conceptualizing, like, what

3669
03:24:30,600 --> 03:24:33,400
it is or even though I'm like, I'm living it.

3670
03:24:33,400 --> 03:24:35,240
It's weird to think like, Oh, 20 years.

3671
03:24:35,240 --> 03:24:35,560
Wow.

3672
03:24:38,760 --> 03:24:40,360
It's wild.

3673
03:24:40,360 --> 03:24:41,240
It is.

3674
03:24:41,240 --> 03:24:42,840
It's absolutely intense.

3675
03:24:42,840 --> 03:24:43,160
It is.

3676
03:24:44,840 --> 03:24:47,400
Well, what do I say here at the end as we start to recap

3677
03:24:47,400 --> 03:24:49,880
tonight? Thank you all for being a part of this, whether

3678
03:24:49,880 --> 03:24:52,440
it was just tonight, whether it's been for the last 20

3679
03:24:52,440 --> 03:24:54,760
years, whether it's been for the last 20 minutes.

3680
03:24:56,520 --> 03:24:58,600
I just want to say thank you so much for being a part of

3681
03:24:58,600 --> 03:24:59,720
Orange Launch Radio.

3682
03:24:59,720 --> 03:25:01,560
Thanks for being a part of this family and our Sunday

3683
03:25:01,560 --> 03:25:05,560
night little gathering here and playing a part in it.

3684
03:25:07,640 --> 03:25:10,200
So many dreams have really come true because of this show

3685
03:25:10,200 --> 03:25:13,800
as talking about earlier, getting to do E3 in the beginning,

3686
03:25:13,800 --> 03:25:17,080
getting games and cameos and video games because of this

3687
03:25:17,080 --> 03:25:19,080
show, getting to meet people.

3688
03:25:19,080 --> 03:25:20,360
I travel to cities.

3689
03:25:21,960 --> 03:25:23,720
I don't want to say around the world because I'm not quite

3690
03:25:23,720 --> 03:25:25,880
that well traveled by travel to cities around the US and

3691
03:25:25,880 --> 03:25:28,920
Canada and any city I go to.

3692
03:25:28,920 --> 03:25:32,040
It's like I know somebody here, and if it's not because of

3693
03:25:32,040 --> 03:25:35,240
OLR directly, it's because somebody I met because of OLR

3694
03:25:35,240 --> 03:25:36,280
and that whole sort of thing.

3695
03:25:36,280 --> 03:25:39,400
And just the impact that the show has had is just incredible.

3696
03:25:39,480 --> 03:25:41,320
And the opportunities I've been given to do things like

3697
03:25:41,320 --> 03:25:44,840
panels at Dragon Con, which has led to other big things.

3698
03:25:44,840 --> 03:25:46,600
It's just incredible.

3699
03:25:46,600 --> 03:25:49,080
And I don't know what else to say, but thank you for being

3700
03:25:49,080 --> 03:25:49,640
a part of it.

3701
03:25:50,920 --> 03:25:52,680
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

3702
03:25:52,680 --> 03:25:54,120
tell a friend or two about the show.

3703
03:25:54,120 --> 03:25:55,960
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every

3704
03:25:55,960 --> 03:25:58,280
gamer has a voice, but we need more voices.

3705
03:25:58,280 --> 03:25:58,600
Always.

3706
03:25:58,600 --> 03:25:59,880
We're still in search of new voices.

3707
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:03,160
Let's get some more.

3708
03:26:03,160 --> 03:26:04,360
Let's get some new faces.

3709
03:26:04,360 --> 03:26:05,480
We love the old faces too.

3710
03:26:05,480 --> 03:26:08,120
Let's get some new faces for some new opinions as we move

3711
03:26:08,120 --> 03:26:12,200
into our 21st year starting next week and approaching the

3712
03:26:12,200 --> 03:26:13,080
legal drinking age.

3713
03:26:14,760 --> 03:26:17,400
Let's go around to get everybody's final thoughts tonight.

3714
03:26:18,040 --> 03:26:19,240
Loki, I will start with you.

3715
03:26:19,240 --> 03:26:19,960
Your final thought.

3716
03:26:20,760 --> 03:26:23,000
My final thought is I would like to remind everybody that

3717
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:28,280
the Steam Summer Sale is going on right now and certain YYR

3718
03:26:28,280 --> 03:26:32,520
games and a certain game about, you know, poop and NES and

3719
03:26:32,520 --> 03:26:34,360
stuff may be on sale right now.

3720
03:26:34,360 --> 03:26:36,040
Also on itch.io is also on sale.

3721
03:26:36,600 --> 03:26:39,960
So check out Pixel Poops number two for $6.99.

3722
03:26:40,920 --> 03:26:42,520
Way to bury the lead.

3723
03:26:42,520 --> 03:26:43,720
You should have said that at the start.

3724
03:26:43,720 --> 03:26:46,440
But no, I hope you sell lots.

3725
03:26:49,640 --> 03:26:52,200
Dark Sakura, I know you're still going to do some Debbie

3726
03:26:52,200 --> 03:26:53,720
tonight, even with the long run time.

3727
03:26:53,720 --> 03:26:54,920
What is your final thought tonight?

3728
03:26:56,120 --> 03:26:57,400
Reject false icons.

3729
03:26:58,280 --> 03:26:59,160
What a throwback.

3730
03:26:59,160 --> 03:27:00,040
Have a good night, Jamie.

3731
03:27:00,600 --> 03:27:01,960
Have a good stream later.

3732
03:27:01,960 --> 03:27:02,600
Later, Tater.

3733
03:27:03,560 --> 03:27:05,000
And then my final thought tonight.

3734
03:27:08,200 --> 03:27:09,320
I'm 44 today.

3735
03:27:09,320 --> 03:27:11,560
We haven't talked a lot about the fact that it is my birthday

3736
03:27:11,560 --> 03:27:13,400
because we're focusing on OLR's birthday right now.

3737
03:27:14,360 --> 03:27:16,920
I was supposed to be in Europe today.

3738
03:27:16,920 --> 03:27:18,360
Yes, I was going to miss this show.

3739
03:27:18,360 --> 03:27:21,240
We would have just had the 20th anniversary be next week or

3740
03:27:21,240 --> 03:27:21,800
something.

3741
03:27:21,800 --> 03:27:24,360
But I was originally going to be in Europe today because I

3742
03:27:24,360 --> 03:27:27,080
was going to see ABBA Voyage, which if you know me, you know

3743
03:27:27,080 --> 03:27:28,760
I'm a huge ABBA stan.

3744
03:27:28,760 --> 03:27:29,560
I love them.

3745
03:27:29,560 --> 03:27:31,560
And seeing Voyage would have been like the closest thing to

3746
03:27:31,560 --> 03:27:32,920
actually seeing them live.

3747
03:27:32,920 --> 03:27:34,840
It didn't work out that way.

3748
03:27:34,840 --> 03:27:38,360
Just because since I bought the tickets that have now gone

3749
03:27:38,360 --> 03:27:41,960
to waste with it away, I got diagnosed with diabetes.

3750
03:27:42,840 --> 03:27:46,040
We bought the house, but we weren't able to get as much help

3751
03:27:46,040 --> 03:27:48,120
on the house as we were originally going to get because

3752
03:27:48,120 --> 03:27:49,000
of some family things.

3753
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:49,800
That's all I'm going to say.

3754
03:27:51,400 --> 03:27:52,760
And just some things happen.

3755
03:27:52,760 --> 03:27:55,080
And so the Europe trip wasn't able to happen this time.

3756
03:27:57,160 --> 03:27:57,960
But that's okay.

3757
03:27:57,960 --> 03:27:59,560
Things have a way of working out.

3758
03:27:59,560 --> 03:28:01,880
And I'm really trying to be thankful for the things I do

3759
03:28:01,880 --> 03:28:08,360
have. Great job, great health under control now that I know

3760
03:28:08,360 --> 03:28:09,080
what's going on.

3761
03:28:10,600 --> 03:28:17,480
And this and all of you that give a shit and go the extra

3762
03:28:17,480 --> 03:28:18,600
mile with this every week.

3763
03:28:19,960 --> 03:28:21,560
I'm very thankful for that.

3764
03:28:21,560 --> 03:28:24,920
And it gives me a lot to be happy about on my birthday today

3765
03:28:24,920 --> 03:28:26,200
as well as OLR's birthday.

3766
03:28:26,200 --> 03:28:26,760
So thank you.

3767
03:28:27,400 --> 03:28:30,360
And to kind of piggyback on something that was said earlier

3768
03:28:30,360 --> 03:28:32,520
in the show, I don't feel 44.

3769
03:28:33,240 --> 03:28:34,360
Do I look 44?

3770
03:28:34,360 --> 03:28:35,320
Don't answer that.

3771
03:28:35,320 --> 03:28:36,680
I don't feel 44.

3772
03:28:36,680 --> 03:28:37,640
I still feel young.

3773
03:28:37,640 --> 03:28:42,200
And I think if this show does go until I'm 64, probably not

3774
03:28:42,200 --> 03:28:43,880
going to realize it then either.

3775
03:28:43,880 --> 03:28:51,000
So yeah, I don't know what else to say for the first time

3776
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:52,360
in a 20 year history.

3777
03:28:52,360 --> 03:28:53,240
I'm out of words.

3778
03:28:55,160 --> 03:28:56,200
Thank you, everyone.

3779
03:28:56,200 --> 03:28:57,000
We'll see you next week.

3780
03:28:57,000 --> 03:28:58,280
Have a wonderful night.

3781
03:28:58,280 --> 03:28:58,760
Good night.

3782
03:29:26,200 --> 03:29:28,280
But you know they were all still true.

3783
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:32,280
See you next week.
