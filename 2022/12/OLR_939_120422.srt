00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Classic Final Fantasy games provided a fantasy. Magical, mystical universes, early industrial works at best. Those themes went largely unchanged into the reality TV show era, post-Survivor, Big Brother, etc. or at least were never emphasized until recently. Final Fantasy XVI is truly entering its teenage years, adopting mature themes of sex, drugs, and torture, and more appear to be in store for us.

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, once again with episode number 939 of our show for tonight, December the fourth of 2022.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me once again, welcome back to the show please DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hey.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hi, welcome back.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hi, thank you.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We missed you although our aim is always improving.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Always.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Always. I hope you had a good, I know you kind of had to go because you were visiting your mom who, you know, you were talking about on the show previously but I hope all things considered you had a great time just catching up with people and all that stuff.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I have news actually.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh?

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Mom. Well, while I was in Alabama mom got moved from the ICU to a regular room.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And they took her catheter out. She was happy about that.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I would be too. I think we all would. Yeah, um, she isn't losing as much oxygen when she moves around and though she's still losing some she's trying to do too much on her own, but they think that she might be ready to be discharged in about a week.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh good.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But then she has to move in with my uncle and we don't know what's going to happen with her house and everything but I'm gonna say this right now, driving from Bay Monette to Mobile, and back in Alabama rain.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Dear people in California.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Never complain about rain again.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because it's been raining here all weekend but this isn't rain.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This has been a light drizzle compared to the shit I drove in.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, I get it. Everything's bigger in the south even the weather.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I will say I will say though, I don't know if it's the lighting if it's makeup or what but you look glowing tonight a little time off is is great for the soul, isn't it?

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, um, I actually changed one of my lights to a warmer light.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay, maybe that's doing it too but-

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And then I have a blue purple here.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And I have a wider light here.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How many frickin lights do you have on you over there?

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I have four.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have two panel lights that are about yay big, and I have a ring light that changes color and right now I have it set to blue and purple.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have a plain white, like my old ring light that's like this but I have it reflecting off of the metal of the desk you and I have the same desk.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I have my other panel light right there that's warm light and I, it turned out pretty nicely.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It does take good lighting and of course you know we are talking about visuals because we do tape live if you want to see us we do tape live.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby black wolf show and we tape live, so that you all can have your live comments to which pod culture with our first

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:53,000
comment tonight, talking about dark soccer setup says there are four lights. Yes, there are indeed four lights confirmed. And by the way for those who aren't live there's always the VOD.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There is the VOD available to our subscribers over twitch.tv slash VOG network, but of course, free as a podcast, as it's been ever since when did we start, I mean the show started in 2002 when a podcast start 2004 I think is when the podcast started free

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:38,000
this has been since the beginning and that's that's not going to change. So yeah, also say hello to something that's been here from the very beginning and isn't going to change. Say hello to tech master Loki. Hello. Hi, Loki, how are you? I'm doing fine. What is you have a very retro game playing behind you tonight as we are broadcasting. It's not a retro game. It's not a retro game. It's a retro inspired game. Clearly, it's a game with that one right now that's a game within a game. But if I restart the video, it's a holiday game.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a holiday game, obviously, because it's a Frog Fraction holiday. What is it? No. I Oh, is it Die Hard? It's Die Hard the arcade. Oh, okay. I see what you did there. Gotcha. All right, good. Good. I'm sorry, I'm still going to to this day say that Gremlins is the better Christmas movie. It's, um, yeah, I guess that's a game within a game. I don't remember playing that game within a game.

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:26,920
Game within a game. But um, yeah, I played this at the arcade quite a bit. I think I think the Die Hard argument is tired. Yes, Die Hard is a holiday movie. Let's move on. My favorite Christmas movie is Batman Returns. That's my favorite Christmas movie. I'm sorry. I try to watch it every holiday. Don't you know Batman Returns was good. I was like, Don't be sorry. It's a great movie.

41
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Um, well, and actually my favorite actual like Christmasy movie that I like is Elf. It's funny because I don't like Will Ferrell. And I don't really like comedies that much not like that. And I love this movie.

42
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:55,440
I guess I'm really cliche because I have memories of watching A Christmas Story, which I know is super cliche at this point. I think it's very symbolic of our generation. But my mom really loved that movie. And you know, so there's there's like, you know, a tie in with that. I wish I wish she could. Well, there was actually like a really shitty.

43
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,920
I know there was a really shitty sequel. Now there's this the sequel that please don't remember the other sequel.

44
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,640
Well, there's the there's the there's the hey,

45
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,840
retcon sequel, maybe

46
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:18,040
this no, it's the this is what we do in 2010 and 2020 is now we just reboot all the shit from the 80s and 90s with where are they 30 years from now. So that is the the Christmas the Christmas story story movie.

47
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:30,240
Just people will either want to watch it because they want to recapture the magic or they'll watch it out of morbid curiosity, so that they can actually legitimately complain about it because they did see it.

48
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,120
Some other folks. Oh, go ahead.

49
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:45,000
I was going to say I did want to make out to the theaters this week and or I wanted to go see Violent Night, which unfortunately, the showtimes just weren't jiving with my free time.

50
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:51,760
But that's another another Christmas movie in the same vein as Fat Man, which is just the best.

51
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,000
That is like it is like if you combine Die Hard with a Christmas movie.

52
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,880
Tiger Claw just brought that up in shadows to read that.

53
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,400
Yeah. I what about stuff like Krampus?

54
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,960
Is there not like a horror movie for the holidays?

55
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,360
The only Krampus I care about is playing a is it The Trapper?

56
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Oh, yeah. Cute skin and DVD.

57
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,440
Yeah. And it's funny is my wife actually liked Fat Man.

58
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,520
Like she was like, I thought there was supposed to be a sequel.

59
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,880
They haven't made a sequel yet.

60
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,320
Oh, yeah.

61
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,640
SSG 100 Matt says there's a Grinch horror movie coming out this week.

62
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,200
That's right. Because it's the same guy that does.

63
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:37,440
It's the same guy that plays Art the Clown from the Terrifier movies, which I I knew about those movies before they were cool because they had the director and a star here.

64
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,800
Look, it's it's I can't watch it.

65
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,760
I can't watch evil clowns.

66
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,960
I sorry. Well, and those movies are violent with a capital B bolded underlined.

67
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,280
It's just it's not my thing, but I understand it is some people's thing and cool for you.

68
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,160
Like have fun.

69
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,160
Have fun.

70
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,360
Derail the topics again.

71
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,440
So let's talk about the biggest movie trailer of the week.

72
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,320
I was just gonna bring it up our minds.

73
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,160
We're on the same one.

74
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,960
Bear is seriously gonna be amazing.

75
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,400
Like I cannot wait.

76
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,720
Okay, maybe not that movie.

77
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,320
Maybe not.

78
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,840
No, the cocaine bear trailer legit looked amazing.

79
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,680
I did see that.

80
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,400
I did dark soccer.

81
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,080
Have you seen this?

82
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,080
You need to look this.

83
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:24,120
There's a movie and it's like based on a true story or whatever called cocaine bear, which makes me think of that meme with the bear.

84
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,520
That's like I fucking love cocaine.

85
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,360
But apparently there was a bear that ingested a bunch of cocaine.

86
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,720
But the thing is, they're taking a sharknado approach.

87
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,160
It seems where this movie knows exactly what it is.

88
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,280
And we love a self-aware shitty movie.

89
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,920
Like it's going to be fantastic.

90
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,400
I am there day one.

91
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,360
Okay, we're sure.

92
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,840
I thought when you.

93
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,280
Okay.

94
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:57,720
I thought when you brought up movie trailers from the week, because it isn't on our show roll, so I'll bring it up now and then we'll get into our kickoff topic.

95
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,160
But there was a new Mario Brothers movie tweet or tweet.

96
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,000
There was a new Mario Brothers movie trailer, probably in a tweet.

97
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,360
People are already tweeting about it.

98
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,840
I'm sure.

99
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,320
I'm sure.

100
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,840
And there was a whole direct Nintendo did about this.

101
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,040
I didn't see the direct, but I did see the second trailer.

102
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:26,040
And I have to say, you know why I have my reservations about who they got to play Mario and the fact that, like, this trailer just confirms he's just doing a second rate Charles Martinet.

103
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,760
He's not.

104
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,600
Here's the thing.

105
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,160
Here's the thing.

106
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,680
At least Captain Lou Albano and Charles Martinet were very different Marios.

107
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,200
There were different approaches to the characters.

108
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,800
They were different.

109
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm sorry, but what I saw in that trailer was second rate Charles Martinet, but it is what it is.

110
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,080
I'm trying to move past that because literally everything else in the trailer I really enjoyed.

111
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:58,400
I thought the fact that they're incorporating like Mario Kart type of elements into it and almost like Smash Brothers, maybe, yes, the way it looks like the stages are kind of like incorporated into it.

112
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,880
Like, it looks really good.

113
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,240
Yeah.

114
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,120
Orange right in chat says Chris Pratt is not going to ruin the movie.

115
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,680
He's not.

116
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,960
Yeah, it's not.

117
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,880
And I'm sure I'm willing to see it be a twist for who, you know, he ruins things.

118
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,360
That's all.

119
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,720
Yeah.

120
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,160
Yeah.

121
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,960
And there was a, I was at Target last night and there were Parks and Recreation dolls and one of them was of Chris Pratt's characters.

122
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,600
I was like, ah, but I was like, but Parks and Rec is so good.

123
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,240
Like he's not taking that from me.

124
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,080
He's just not like that was back when, before he just was everywhere.

125
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,000
That's what it is.

126
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,880
Y'all like y'all it's, it's the oversaturation thing.

127
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,440
I really don't have a problem with him.

128
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Like, I like the stuff he's in.

129
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,560
Like, I don't know, except Jurassic World.

130
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,360
That just is awful.

131
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,640
But the problems are with him as a person.

132
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah.

133
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,280
Yeah.

134
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,640
It's, it's, it's some of the ways he's treated his ex-wife and some of the other affiliations.

135
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,800
But anyway, I'm not, I'm not going to let, he's not going to ruin this movie for me because...

136
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,920
I file him under problematic faves for a lot of people.

137
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,440
Yes.

138
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,600
I don't care for him as a person.

139
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,760
I, he's...

140
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
Yeah.

141
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,360
You can't pick one evil over another.

142
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,720
Exactly.

143
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,080
Exactly.

144
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,960
So here's the thing.

145
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,440
Otherwise, the movie looks really good.

146
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,720
Like I don't want that to ruin what otherwise was a really good trailer otherwise.

147
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,720
And let me say this.

148
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:28,680
One thing I absolutely noticed about this trailer that I didn't hear a lot of people talking about is that if you want to talk about problematic fave, it seems that this movie took one of the most tired tropes that Mario is, that Mario is usually guilty of, which is the save the damsel in distress trope.

149
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,600
And it looks like it's flipping that on its head because Princess Peach appears to be the sidekick character.

150
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,840
And it looks like Luigi's the damsel in distress.

151
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,920
Now, granted, it could always be a misdirect.

152
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,240
It could always, you know, the trailer is only a trailer.

153
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,720
But certainly we saw Princess Peach doing a lot of different things.

154
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,440
And they're really rounding out her character, which I think is great.

155
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,440
Like I've always loved Princess Peach from Mario 2, to be honest, and her floating ability.

156
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,160
So I think they should all stand as equals.

157
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,920
The Mario 2 quintet, I almost said quintet, the Mario 2 quartet should stand as equals.

158
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,040
So I think I think it's cool.

159
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,680
I will point out that she took that role because of palette swap necessity.

160
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,280
However,

161
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,240
hey, whatever the reason.

162
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,200
It worked.

163
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I, I, I like her as a character.

164
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,240
I played her 90% of the game.

165
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,280
You know, when for Super Mario USA.

166
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,800
And to be fair before it before everyone's because you know, I like like, look, I haven't used Twitter in weeks, but I already know I already can tell there's going to be people

167
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:46,120
that are on there that are like, these fucking movies going woke with this Princess Peach in the night and armor woke this woke bullshit these woke movies doing this woke shit.

168
00:12:47,720 --> 00:13:01,480
Just so you know, if you were a real gamer, you would know that Luigi was already the damsel in distress in the Mario games in Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island, Luigi was the one needing saving.

169
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,880
So this isn't exactly new to the franchise.

170
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,800
So sit down, sit on it, shut up, delete your Twitter, make me a sandwich.

171
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,720
The only thing that is being saving in Super Mario World 2 was our eardrums of Mario crying the entire time.

172
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,000
Did you see the TV spots that they have also?

173
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,240
Oh, no, I didn't see those trailers.

174
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,800
No, different in different languages.

175
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,520
I have TV footage in there.

176
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,920
So well, nobody, but like it's on the internet as well.

177
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,560
They had like different they're from different regions, obviously.

178
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,560
And they had different stuff being shown.

179
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,200
It means all good stuff.

180
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,360
So it looks yeah, I've very exciting.

181
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,400
I've gone from whatever about the movie to like, okay, yeah, I do want to see this.

182
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,920
Like I want to take I want to take Dark Sakura and Loki.

183
00:13:49,080 --> 00:14:00,600
I want to go on a throuple date, whoever else wants to go can come to but I want to go on a date and go get a big tub of popcorn and just watch this crap and be entertained by it because it's going to be a

184
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,800
bunch of nostalgia stuff.

185
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,040
I'm I'm really into it.

186
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,520
DJ Rama asked in chat says I swear if they make Daisy the damsel in distress.

187
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,920
I'm going post apocalyptic.

188
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,360
I don't think that you would already know Daisy's in the movie if that was the case.

189
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,760
So I don't think that's happening.

190
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,840
But who's to say that Daisy won't play some role in the sequel?

191
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,680
Like I'm actively thinking about where the hell does a sequel go now from this point?

192
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,920
Because I think that could be very interesting, to be honest.

193
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:34,320
So and this idea that maybe they are setting up a metaverse with or multiverse or whatever with Donkey Kong, and all this other stuff.

194
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,640
I it could be interesting.

195
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,320
So Tiger Klein chat says I think having peach having a more active role is great.

196
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,840
She has recently been playing in some of the games so makes sense.

197
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
She goes on the adventure.

198
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,200
Yes.

199
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,680
And I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I've seen enough of this stuff over the years.

200
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,480
I'm telling you, Charles Martinet is one of two things in this movie.

201
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,520
He's Wario, like at the very end, and some type of setup for the next movie where Wario is the bad.

202
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,200
I think that's less likely.

203
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,440
Number two, and I think this is absolutely what it's going to be.

204
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,240
He's going to be Mario and Luigi's father, which is a character that's never been introduced in the games or anything.

205
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:22,400
And absolutely, Mario and Luigi's I bet Charles Martinet is going to play a parent or grandparent, some type of family member of Mario and Luigi's that we've never met.

206
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,160
So we'll see.

207
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,320
Come back, clip it, and we'll come back to this in a few months when the movie's out.

208
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,480
Let's see.

209
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,480
Tiger class says the movie mentions about galaxies, so it's possible we might see Rosalina.

210
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,040
There's a leak of a toy that shows what appears to be Luma Lee.

211
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,600
Ooh, I can't see in our chat.

212
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,840
Welcome, welcome, says Jumpman.

213
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:57,760
That's a really clever way to how to incorporate like a father figure for Mario and Luigi is that it could trace back to the OG Mario or Jumpman from the Donkey Kong games.

214
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:09,800
It could tie into, you know, Donkey Kong being a brute now and all this stuff like I don't know, I didn't write the movie, but I could I could see where like the more classic Jumpman could be something that Charles Martinet is is actually playing.

215
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,040
So I think that's a clever little way they could do it.

216
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,760
So we'll see.

217
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,720
We'll see.

218
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,800
Anyway, all right.

219
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,080
That wasn't really on our list of things to talk about tonight.

220
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,880
But when we started talking about movies, had to talk about that a little bit.

221
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,880
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks.

222
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,920
But speaking of Nintendo, not all the news is good on Nintendo front this week.

223
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,960
In fact, this is one this is I don't I don't know what else to say.

224
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,920
Loki, this is just a mess.

225
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,800
It's a mess.

226
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,840
It's confusing is what it is.

227
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:50,880
It's basically there was this Smash World Tour that was going on, and they had announced that it was, without warning, being shut down by Nintendo, who told them they can no longer operate.

228
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:59,720
And of course, Smash World Tour is run by a third party group of fans who put together a bunch of these different tournaments.

229
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:09,400
And I think it was like almost at the yeah, the annual championship was coming up with massive cash prizes, and I think they even had like a charity element to it as well.

230
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:24,200
But now it's yeah, they're going to have a prize pool of was it $250,000 and they were even having planning on having a prize pool of $350,000 for 2023.

231
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:32,600
But without warning, they said we were received notice the night before Thanksgiving from Nintendo that we can no longer operate.

232
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,880
And we've so it there's a lot to it.

233
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:53,720
So the Smash World Tour organizers, basically saying, you know, we don't know where everything will land quite yet with the contract sponsor obligation.

234
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:54,840
Etc.

235
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,080
In short, we will be losing hundreds of thousands of dollars due to Nintendo's actions.

236
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,840
That being said, we are more we're taking steps to remedy many issues that have risen from the cancellation.

237
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,240
So there is going to be working with that.

238
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:20,200
But then, of course, there's also this drama that's going on with Panda, which is the Panda Cup, which is a separate entity whatsoever that runs another set of tournaments as well.

239
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:30,200
And there's allegations that they're responsible for Nintendo canceling it.

240
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:45,320
And because they're like animosity between the two groups or something like that, basically saying in November 2021, after Panda Cup was first announced, Nintendo contacted us to jump on a call with a few folks on their team, including a representative from their legal team.

241
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:53,000
We were truly thought that we might be getting shut down, given the fact that they had licensed a competing circuit and partner in Panda.

242
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,800
Once we joined the call, we were very surprised to hear the opposite.

243
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,760
Then, of course, they had been reached.

244
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:07,720
They reached out to know that they've been watching us for years and they, you know, wanted to see if we were interested in working with them and pursue a license as well.

245
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,320
So originally they had kind of gotten somewhat of a license for 2022, but in 2023 was in the air.

246
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:20,920
Then after all this, there's not a lot of time to 2023, especially if you want to plan tournaments, you got to get people more than six weeks to plan for it.

247
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,640
And we're less like four weeks from 2023 at this point.

248
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,920
So, yeah.

249
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,400
Okay.

250
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,960
Anyway, go ahead.

251
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:39,000
Um, so then a Nintendo spokesperson, um, had told Kotaku, for example, that unfortunately, after continuous conversations with Smash World Tour, and after giving some deep considerations, we apply any potential partner.

252
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,880
We were unable to come to an agreement with Smash World Tour for full circuit in 2023.

253
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:56,280
Nintendo did not request any changes or cancellations of the remaining events in 2022, including the 2022 championship event and consider the negative impact on players who are already planning to participate.

254
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:16,680
Um, of course, then Smash World Tour, um, organizers had been, you know, they disputed the statement saying that unfortunately, um, or, uh, as a last ditch effort, we, uh, asked if we could continue running the championship and the tour next year without a license and shift our focus working with them in 2024.

255
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:23,800
We alluded how last year's function in the capacity with mutual understanding that we would not get shut down and focus on the future.

256
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,920
We were told differently.

257
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,600
Those times are now over.

258
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:34,040
And this was the final, the final nail in the coffin given to, um, the very, our very particular relationship with Nintendo.

259
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,400
This is when we realized it was truly all being shut down for real.

260
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,120
We asked if they understood the waves that would make, uh, being forced to cancel and the Nintendo communicated that they were indeed aware.

261
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:53,480
Um, but I remember them saying though, also that they they've also issued yet Nintendo's issued a second statement saying that, um, that's how you know, this is messy.

262
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,280
I'm sorry, Nintendo actually, number one, Nintendo commenting at all is kind of a shock.

263
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,960
The fact that they're commented on it twice, this is a communications disaster.

264
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:12,200
This is a communications disaster, and you can hear it in these statements because very clearly everybody has their own perspective.

265
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,160
Nobody can agree on what the fuck is actually going on.

266
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:26,840
Yeah, cause they said that, uh, Nintendo's decision, uh, was solely based on our assessment for the proposals submitted by SWT and our evaluations of their unlicensed activities.

267
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,840
This decision was not influenced by external partners like Panda Global.

268
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:37,880
Any partner that we grant a license to has to meet some high standards we require when it comes to the health and safety of our fans.

269
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:46,920
It also is important that our partners adhere to our brand and IP guidelines and conduct themselves according to professional organizational best practices.

270
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,920
We use this same approach, um, to independently assess all partners.

271
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,760
If we discover a partner is doing something inappropriate, we will work to correct it.

272
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:10,200
When we notify SWT that we would not license their 2022 or 2023 activities, we also let them know verbally that we were not requiring they cancel the 2022 final events because of the impact it would have on all players.

273
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,040
Thus the decision to cancel SWT 2022 was and still is their own choice.

274
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:23,880
Uh, we are open to partnering with other organizations that will continue to offer licenses for major tournaments outside of the Panda Cup.

275
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:31,240
Panda Global will continue to be a key partner and we look forward to receiving proposals from other groups and tournament licenses, et cetera.

276
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,080
Um, I need Katie Porter and her fucking whiteboard right now because I don't understand any of this.

277
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,400
I think it's fucking stupid anyways that you have to like license from Nintendo to run a tournament for a game.

278
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:53,480
Like, I think part of it though is because you have to use their, uh, intellectual property and advertisement, the name of it, everything, it's all licensing.

279
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,600
So that absolutely makes 100% sense.

280
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,000
It's like SuperbOwl, that type of thing.

281
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,260
Yeah.

282
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:08,120
But yeah, um, Mike Deaf brings up an interesting thing, subsequent thing that has happened to make this even messier, uh, in chat.

283
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,680
Uh, and I was reading about this online too, is that apparently a lot of Panda Global members have now quit the org.

284
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,080
Because of this whole, you know, how often do we see this in gaming?

285
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,400
It doesn't even matter what the news is.

286
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,600
It's what's perceived.

287
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:29,080
So in this situation, it definitely seems there's a perception there that Panda somehow strong are in Nintendo into shutting down Smash World Tour.

288
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,320
I'm not saying that's what actually happened.

289
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:39,160
I'm just saying clearly that perception is out there because 80% they're saying of people behind Panda Global are leaving.

290
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,120
So now what?

291
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,960
So, but I will say this, I will say this.

292
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,720
Kudos to those people that work for these things.

293
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:55,400
And, you know, don't, I don't think they're donating their time, but spend their time on these types of events and so forth for being able to walk away.

294
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,320
Because basically they're saying, without us, you're fucked.

295
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,820
Good luck.

296
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,160
And they're effectively shutting down Panda by doing this.

297
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,320
Uh, dark soccer, your mute hard mute on discord.

298
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:10,920
There we go.

299
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,040
I do wonder who could actually strong arm Nintendo.

300
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,160
I mean, realistically.

301
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,800
Well, Nintendo is not going to put on these events themselves, but I mean, they're just doing themselves a disservice.

302
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,640
Nintendo doesn't really need the money or advertising.

303
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,360
No, they've already sold the games and they've sold the DLC.

304
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,840
I mean, this is just bonus.

305
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:40,680
Yeah, no, it's just keeping the IP around for the inevitable sequel that will come out, whether Sakurai does it or not.

306
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:47,000
There will be another Smash Brothers for the next system, uh, somehow, some way.

307
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,040
Um, but yeah, it's just, you're right.

308
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,200
Nintendo doesn't necessarily have a horse in the race at the end of the day.

309
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:01,960
So it's just interesting that everybody's cutting themselves off to, to, um, yeah.

310
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,680
And then at the end of the day, everyone is giving a different story.

311
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,000
Yeah.

312
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,920
And at the end of the day, it's the fans and the competitors that are suffering truly.

313
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:14,040
And this'll just, this'll go exactly back to where I'm sure none of these people won it.

314
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:21,720
And that is stores at com or excuse me, uh, tournaments at small stores, comic book shops around the country that there's too many of them.

315
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,520
They can't shut them down.

316
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:30,200
You know, homegrown tournaments, the way, the way we used to do it in the DDR scene, we didn't eat Konami's permission to do a fucking DDR tournament.

317
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,160
We just did it.

318
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,880
Cause Konami was like, here's some free shit.

319
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,520
Actually, actually.

320
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:34,760
Yeah.

321
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,320
The Bay Area, they oftentimes donated stuff.

322
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,400
So I guess maybe it's a terrible compare, but that was back when Konami was cool.

323
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,960
Like, you know, now the whole joke is maybe Konami would Sue.

324
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,480
If you tried to do it these days, uh, I guess there are so ridiculous though.

325
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,560
Like, I mean, cause like you look at stuff like Evo and stuff like that, where they've had to take smash out because of this nonsense.

326
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,720
So yeah, it's Nintendo.

327
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,160
It's always Nintendo.

328
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,720
It's always the understanding how to like interact with the community and stuff.

329
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,880
It's just, I don't know.

330
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,760
And I get it like, Oh, it's Japanese company.

331
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,280
But that, that argument's only going to take you so far.

332
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:22,760
It's, you know, especially now that we're in this era of, we know Nintendo is just as guilty of some of this or allegedly just as guilty of some of this union busting stuff.

333
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,840
The way they treat their workers, their contractors or their full-time stuff.

334
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:33,480
They, they are guilty of, you know, um, infection within the game industry, as much as a lot of other companies out there.

335
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,440
Nintendo is not immune to this.

336
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,960
So this whole excuse of they're just a Japanese company don't fly anymore.

337
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,920
So, yeah.

338
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,420
Yeah.

339
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:52,840
Things that go beyond culture, you know, universally accepted things, especially when you're playing on a world market.

340
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,240
Right.

341
00:26:53,240 --> 00:27:04,280
Well, and it's kind of like, you know, I realize it's a little apple to oranges, but you know, I think about the story we just had a few weeks ago about Square Enix and that really, really poor statement.

342
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,680
From Yoshi P on why there are no people of color in Final Fantasy 16.

343
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:14,760
And we had a whole discussion about Japanese developers are just, it's there.

344
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,400
They, they don't see it the same way.

345
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,000
It's not in their culture the same way.

346
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,800
This is a problem in the Japanese development industry that needs to be addressed.

347
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,560
Not just Yoshi P statement.

348
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,440
Yoshi P statement is a symptom of that problem.

349
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:43,160
So it would be interesting to see what Japanese developers kind of have to face in the next, you know, few years, because we've already had ironically Square Enix come out and say we need to make games that appeal on a global scale.

350
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,280
And then they say that with one hand, and then the other hand, they do something to actively work against that.

351
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:56,360
Anyway, and I do want to point out something that's going back from like old anime arguments, like from the 80s and whatnot.

352
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,040
Technically, they're based off Japanese models.

353
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,560
I mean, they're not really even I mean, in modern 3D games.

354
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:11,640
Yeah, but just like people would have the same argument about anime, but technically, they weren't white there either.

355
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:25,800
So anyway, my point is, this whole Nintendo is a Japanese company, and they just do things differently that the amount of times you can use that excuse is has run out for Nintendo.

356
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,520
Like we now do business on a global scale.

357
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,360
Video games is a global business.

358
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,080
All of these things are global, like that certain things are just going to have to change.

359
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:42,600
And the way they approach communication is one of those things that very clearly has to change.

360
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,640
Again, I'm shocked they put out two statements to be quite honest.

361
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:54,920
And I can even read between the lines on that second statement that apparently the Smash World Tour did something that they didn't like.

362
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:05,800
But they're just not being clear in what that is for probably professional reasons, because it's not very nice to call out people in a very public way about what it is they did.

363
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:11,960
But I feel like that's what the internet and the fans need to hear is what specifically is the problem.

364
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,000
But we're not going to know.

365
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,280
It's just that's that's how it is.

366
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,160
We're never going to know unless it comes out in court.

367
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,800
Maybe that's where this whole thing ends up in a courtroom somewhere.

368
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,560
Sure seems destined that way.

369
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,200
Anyway, less destined for a courtroom.

370
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,520
Hopefully us and the video games we've been playing this week.

371
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.

372
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,920
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming month?

373
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,320
I played, of course, a lot of Dead by Daylight.

374
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,080
Been playing actually with a lot of different people.

375
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:55,160
I ended up like doing the playing on Thursday for Thirst Trap, apart from my own streams.

376
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:03,560
And then for the last two weeks in a row, I always would get an invite from Intoxicated to play as well.

377
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,720
So I've been on like seven hour Dead by Daylight binges where thankfully I don't have to do a lot of talking.

378
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,920
But it was just like, where did this come from?

379
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,280
I was lurking in Intoxicated's channel one night.

380
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,560
It was like midnight or something.

381
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,080
I was playing a game on my first monitor and I was channel surfing on Twitch, as I often do.

382
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,520
And I heard you and saw you in the chat and I just cracked up.

383
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,760
I was gonna say hi, but I was like, sometimes it's more fun to just lurk.

384
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,140
Yeah.

385
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,920
Were you there to see the four megs?

386
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,480
No, that doesn't sound familiar.

387
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,640
I will send you a picture of the four megs.

388
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,400
He was getting tunneled out.

389
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,280
And he was really puffy about that.

390
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,200
Things have been stinky.

391
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,240
Yeah, the game needs a kick in the butt.

392
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,640
I don't know.

393
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,680
I don't know what else to say about it.

394
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,240
It just needs a kick in the butt beyond just continued DLC.

395
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,360
They need to stop rewarding people for having no skill.

396
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,840
At any rate, I also do want to remind other players that if you log into your account every day,

397
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,200
then they're doing the December advent calendar for Dead by Daylight where you can get

398
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,520
uh, usually 25,000 blood points.

399
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,480
There will be like a big bunch of stuff for Christmas and Christmas Eve and a couple of

400
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,560
weekends where you get 50,000 where you get rift shards and iridescent shards.

401
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,720
So, um, definitely good thing to do.

402
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,200
Even if you're not planning on playing that day, just log into your game.

403
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:39,800
Um, I have a game that I super, super want, but I don't have the hundred bucks to

404
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,760
dump on it right now.

405
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,240
And I really want Marvel Midnight Suns because I want the, the legendary so I can get all

406
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,200
the outfits and the DLC do the whole game.

407
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,480
Um, but I'm taking donations of steam wallet gift certificates.

408
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,200
Everybody.

409
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,760
I'm kidding.

410
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:05,960
Um, I have also, of course, I did my stupid word scapes game, which, uh, kind of getting

411
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,600
annoyed with it.

412
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,760
Um, I played a little cult of the lamb.

413
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,000
I've played Final Fantasy five.

414
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,480
We just got the submarine last night and, um, I played something else and I can't remember

415
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,160
for the life of me what it was.

416
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:31,320
Oh, well, as I say, I watched you play in Final Fantasy five as well, but it must be

417
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,480
something you didn't stream because I didn't, you know,

418
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,280
well, I, I play stuff that I do on stream.

419
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,120
It's just like, um, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

420
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,840
Uh, I started to play a little bit of hooked on you again.

421
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,640
They just had an update for it, but I didn't.

422
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,400
I like kind of logged into it and then I was like, oh, I got stuff to do.

423
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,720
So I've been playing around a lot in like DAZ 3d trying to make different, you know,

424
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,520
3d models and stuff and thinking about making my Vtuber in it.

425
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,560
Oh, okay.

426
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,520
Oh, cool.

427
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,020
Yeah.

428
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,960
So we did get the Genesis mini too.

429
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,160
I'm just going to add that in.

430
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,240
Oh, there was some play on that.

431
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,520
Nice.

432
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,280
Any games that stuck out for you?

433
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,160
We played Space Harrier.

434
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,200
There's a lot of good stuff on there.

435
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,040
You know, it's just good old Genesis games.

436
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,320
We raided somebody last week cause you, you weren't here after the show.

437
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,080
So we did a couple of raids on some, some randos and one week, one week I did an old

438
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,200
DDR freak pal.

439
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,560
One of the weeks you weren't here.

440
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,640
I let Bobby pick last week and he, he picked somebody he knows through games done quick

441
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,160
and I'm sure he'll shout out who it was in chat.

442
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,200
But the reason why I bring it up is that the raid message was a welcome to the fantasy

443
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,040
zone, get ready with the whole space Harrier thing.

444
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,120
And I was like, oh, I wish dark soccer has seen that.

445
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,000
Cause that's like legit like her thing.

446
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,880
So my, well, my channel is technically nicknamed the fantasy zone.

447
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,280
Yeah.

448
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,780
Yeah.

449
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,280
So cartridge blowers was the name of the streamer says Bobby.

450
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,720
So I like it.

451
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,200
I like it.

452
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,480
We'll have to, uh, and I've, I've, you know, I've been talking with people about doing

453
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,760
some Twitch related things in the public.

454
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,080
So keep your eyes open maybe.

455
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,580
Okay.

456
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:12,840
All right.

457
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,960
No, I'm keeping them shut.

458
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,460
Okay.

459
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,760
Then I'm going to eat my spaghetti.

460
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:17,960
All right.

461
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,920
Moving on.

462
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,200
Let's go to Loki.

463
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,080
How was your gaming week?

464
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,720
It was all Minecraft as usual.

465
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,360
I've been just trying to like grind out stuff.

466
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,360
It's been a month since I put out a video on the channel, 64 SMPs.

467
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,480
This is because I had a really complicated build in redstone stuff and it's done.

468
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,680
Um, just editing the video now.

469
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,280
Awesome.

470
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:48,440
So the film stuff, but yeah, it, it was, um, it came out good, but it was a journey to

471
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,000
get it done.

472
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,260
All right.

473
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,000
Well, if that's it, uh, I'll go to my gaming week.

474
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,520
Um, a lot of the same stuff, a little bit of dead by daylight, but not a lot.

475
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,040
Um, I also played, um, Uh, a little more vampire survivors.

476
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,960
Cause I've been talking about that on previous shows.

477
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,320
I've been into that, um, Pokemon crack.

478
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,720
It is.

479
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,320
And I want to get that other one that, um, Nick was playing the soul survivors or whatever

480
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,800
it's called.

481
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,960
I want to get that one also pretty.

482
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,120
So I'll probably grab that at some point, but when I stream, I really try to limit myself

483
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,320
to Pokemon scarlet.

484
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,760
I'm way behind everyone else.

485
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,360
Cause I just, I with, I've had some other stuff going on personally this week.

486
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,880
So I just have not really been able to get around to streaming and I've been seeing my

487
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,560
Pokemon scarlet gameplay for stream.

488
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,400
I know people have run circles around that game.

489
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,720
Now.

490
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,520
Shane has beat both violet and scarlet at this point is in how many times he completed

491
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,040
his decks completely.

492
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,800
So I know like, yeah.

493
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,000
So, and I'm, I'm sitting here going, I have seven badges, but now keep in mind, it's not

494
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,120
just eight gym badges.

495
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,720
It's eight gym badges.

496
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:55,000
I think five Titan badges and maybe five star badges, question mark.

497
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,840
Somebody will might correct me on that if I'm wrong, but I have seven.

498
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,280
So I have two, two and three.

499
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,440
I have three gyms and two of the, two of the other ones.

500
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,440
So I'm a little behind, but that's okay.

501
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,920
You know what?

502
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,120
I do things at my own pace.

503
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,040
It took me a year to beat sword and shield.

504
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,920
So I'm fine.

505
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,600
I'm, I'm, I'm moving on with it.

506
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,080
It's it's fine.

507
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,720
So I've been playing that the other game I've been playing is really surprised me.

508
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,080
I didn't even know if I wanted to talk about it tonight, but I'm going to, cause I know

509
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,840
I'm going to get made fun of for this, but I I'm like, whatever, you know what?

510
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,880
I'm all about honesty and transparency here on orange knowledge radio.

511
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,320
I haven't been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14 lately.

512
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,960
There's a little bit of a content lull in the game.

513
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,360
The free company that I was in is basically falling apart.

514
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,640
Well, I shouldn't say that.

515
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,240
I don't really know the people in my free company and like, but, but all of the friends

516
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,480
that I play with, none of them are playing anymore.

517
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,760
So I like don't have anything to do right now.

518
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,800
I I've not fallen out of love with a Final Fantasy 14 by any means, but I'm just in a

519
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,560
lull and I'm just kind of like, you know what?

520
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,000
Yoshi P and Final Fantasy 14.

521
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,600
I think it's not you, it's me.

522
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,480
We just need to see, see other people for a little while.

523
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,720
We just need to, we just, and you know what?

524
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,880
One of my, one of my old F buddies just put out a new expansion this week.

525
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,480
And so I reactivated my wow account.

526
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,480
I'm, I'm not touching any of those games until what the fuck is gone.

527
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,800
I, I, I understand those concerns.

528
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,760
And I'm not happy about it either.

529
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,320
I feel like after the behavior of another person who has association with the company,

530
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,520
I'm kind of disgusted.

531
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:41,480
I, I have to walk a fine line here because I have several friends that work at said company

532
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,760
and I want to respect their work, but still hate their CEO.

533
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,880
As I've said a few weeks ago on this show, when I was talking about Overwatch 2 and,

534
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:55,160
you know, Diablo and some of that, here's the thing is that, well, number one, you know,

535
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,600
we all know the standby, there's no ethical consumption or capitalism, blah, blah, blah,

536
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,000
that whole thing.

537
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,440
You have to pick your battles, blah, blah, blah.

538
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:07,400
All of these problems that started with Activision Blizzard are very clearly industry-wide

539
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:07,880
problems.

540
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,840
So I would have to quit gaming to really, you know, suitably address all of the issues

541
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,240
that are going on.

542
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,440
I have to quit Nintendo games.

543
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,760
We've talked about that in a previous episode.

544
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,600
I'd have to quit Ubisoft games.

545
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,800
I'd have to go, you know, you name it, there's problems everywhere.

546
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,720
All of these problems are at every studio.

547
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,160
So I feel like we have to walk a line and I want to encourage my friends that are, you

548
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,440
know, working hard on these types of things and really incur well.

549
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,920
And also through that, I've also heard, and I don't know what I can and can't say, so

550
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,120
I'm always going to err on the side of can't say, because people tell me these things in

551
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:49,160
confidence, that there are real tangible changes that are going on in the culture.

552
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,400
And I've been told specifically some of the changes that happened versus the way it used

553
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:53,900
to be.

554
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,280
So there is change happening, even if it isn't always visible.

555
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,320
Like I said, part of my reason is also spite.

556
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,080
I understand.

557
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,040
That's your reason.

558
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,840
This is my reason.

559
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,960
So I just, you know, I was kind of curious, like actually what it was.

560
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,480
And it wasn't just the whole new expansion, actually.

561
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,160
I was super curious about WoW Classic, which just bumped up to Wrath of the Lich King.

562
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,480
And I was like, it really was.

563
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,920
I want to go shack up with my ex and I want to go play Wrath of the Lich King for a little

564
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,480
bit.

565
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,520
And so I was like, all right, whatever, I'm going to pay the money, the 15 bucks to try

566
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,360
this month and go play Classic Wrath.

567
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,200
And I was actually having a really good time with it.

568
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,640
Yes, it's a grind.

569
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,960
Yes, you know, but it really was.

570
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,880
It felt like playing an old PlayStation 2 RPG.

571
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,320
You know, like I'm going back to visit this old friend and, you know, I'm having a good

572
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,820
time with it.

573
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,720
Where the game started to lose me a little bit is when I got up to the content where

574
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:05,240
I could run dungeons, there's hardly anybody online and there's no dungeon finders.

575
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,720
So you can't find people like nobody's doing the baby dungeons.

576
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,600
If anybody's online doing dungeons, they're all doing the end game stuff.

577
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,720
And since there's no dungeon finder, they're all doing shouts and all that stuff.

578
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,800
So that's when I started to be like, all right, I'm kind of running out of stuff to do.

579
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,120
So that's why I went, you know what?

580
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,440
Fuck it.

581
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,520
Let me go see what's going on in retail.

582
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,480
By the way, you'll notice I never said I bought the expansion.

583
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,220
I haven't.

584
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,880
I just said, all right, since I re-upped this sub so I could play classic anyway, let me

585
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,520
see what the hell's going on in retail.

586
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,020
Wow.

587
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,080
And I got to say, because I haven't touched it in quite a long time, I was very like,

588
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:50,440
holy shit, this game has changed because I guess with this most recent expansion, they

589
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,120
actually completely redid the UI.

590
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,760
And you want to know what the gag is about the UI?

591
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,920
It is extremely Final Fantasy XIV's UI.

592
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,440
Now, but this is what's fascinating about it.

593
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,720
That's actually not a dig on WoW.

594
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,640
This is actually where I wanted WoW to be like five years ago when WoW was very boring

595
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,560
to me, was that I was like, you know what?

596
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,840
Warcraft maybe needs to get knocked off of its pedestal a little bit to really see what

597
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,000
else is going on out there and maybe take influence from some of the other kids out

598
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,560
on the market.

599
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,800
And it took a little while, but boy, oh boy, does it seem like that's exactly what's

600
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,600
happened.

601
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:36,120
And I'm noticing an extreme amount of increase in the amount of cut scenes, voice acting

602
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:40,120
and the other types of music and the other types of things that Final Fantasy XIV is

603
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,840
known for.

604
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,560
But you know what?

605
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:47,160
This isn't just a, haha, WoW is more like Final Fantasy XIV because guess what?

606
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,120
This is a silical thing in the industry.

607
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,520
This goes round and round because you know what?

608
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:59,800
Final Fantasy XIV 1.0, remember, sucked ass bad.

609
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,400
And when they redid 2.0 in Realm Reborn, do you remember what Yoshi P cited as one of

610
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,280
the big influences for Final Fantasy XIV in Realm Reborn?

611
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,040
World of Warcraft.

612
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:19,160
So now we're at a point with these MMOs where it's clear that it's not just one influencing

613
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,720
the other, they're influencing each other.

614
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,800
That is the coolest part of, I think, what I've experienced so far.

615
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,840
I'm like, it blows my mind.

616
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,440
The UI has a UI edit mode and it is like, it is exactly Final Fantasy XIV's UI edit

617
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:34,840
mode.

618
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,640
Exactly.

619
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,560
Like it's not, it's different components because it's WoW versus XIV, but like the

620
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:45,160
UI edit thing is exactly like move this frame here, resize it, move this, the little things

621
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,120
in the corner.

622
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,800
It's all, it's all XIV's UI.

623
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,640
Good.

624
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,680
But like how many people replace all that shit anyway using deadly boss mods?

625
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,480
So true.

626
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,440
So true.

627
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,520
Because I was watching Twitch streamers play it because that was also a big part of my,

628
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,840
I wonder, I wonder what my ex is up to.

629
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,040
Twitch was a huge enabler in that department and wondering what my ex is up to and watch

630
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,520
what's going on.

631
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,760
And I, I see all these different streams like I can't fucking tell shit for shit from

632
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,600
all these mods that people are running.

633
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,440
And I had, I didn't, like, I was watching people play the newest expansion.

634
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,880
I was like, I, I don't know what the hell's going on here outside of the cut scenes and

635
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,480
some of these other things because I cannot understand their UI.

636
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,920
But when I saw the default UI for the first time, when I booted up WoW retail, I was like,

637
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,440
I legit texted Shane right away.

638
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:42,040
And I was like, you didn't tell me that, wow, like didn't just like get some influence

639
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,960
from Final Fantasy XIV, but like got like a lot of influence from Final Fantasy XIV.

640
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,400
See, I was actually about to re-up my XIV account.

641
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,040
And like I said, everything I've just talked about has nothing to do with like, I dislike

642
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,920
XIV or anything.

643
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,360
I'll be back there when the new patch is out.

644
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,320
There's just a content lol for me, but I've, I've played, I literally have maxed out everything

645
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,160
you can do on Island Sanctuary.

646
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,680
I don't end game raid.

647
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,360
There's nothing left for me right now, but there will be in subsequent patches.

648
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:12,760
Cool.

649
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,880
I'll look forward to that.

650
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,360
I'm actually glad for a change because usually Final Fantasy XIV and WoW kind of release

651
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,720
content on the same day.

652
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,600
I don't know if it's intentional or not, but like they didn't do that this time.

653
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,000
And I think that's really good actually.

654
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,200
So yeah.

655
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,720
So anyway, yeah.

656
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,960
Miramews in chat says, we'll be here for your hangover and walk of shame in a few weeks.

657
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,520
Thank you.

658
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,400
Appreciate that.

659
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,080
Mike Defton chat says, competition brings innovation.

660
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,580
Yep.

661
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,400
SSJ100Matt says, so Horde House coming back when?

662
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:47,400
Um, actually grandpa's been asking when he can come on Orange Lounge Radio.

663
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,840
And I said, as soon as he can clean up his mouth, cause the jokes he used to make back

664
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,360
then aren't going to fly today.

665
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:57,400
So that's one, but at some point, but then Shane's like, oh, we need to stream or something.

666
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,160
So really all I need to do is call X Defer and we probably could get a reunion.

667
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,000
So just, you know, wait for it.

668
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,760
Um, SSJ100Matt also says, hey boo, you up?

669
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,960
Rob's text to wow.

670
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,400
Questbuster says, no shame taking a break to play something else.

671
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,120
Uh, yeah.

672
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,480
Dark Tetsuya's huh?

673
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,640
Just what went in through my head.

674
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,680
No booty calls.

675
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,600
That's not happening.

676
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,720
Dark Tetsuya said Rob's breaking up with Final Fantasy 14.

677
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,480
No, we're not breaking up.

678
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,560
We're just opening the relationship for a little bit.

679
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:33,960
That's all.

680
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,360
All right.

681
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,200
All right.

682
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,480
So that was my gaming week.

683
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,280
There you go.

684
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,240
Now you all know why I didn't want to talk about it, but I'm going to, I'm going to be

685
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,600
honest here on orange launch radio.

686
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,160
That's what I do.

687
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:46,360
All right.

688
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,880
Uh, if you want to, if you want to send your comments and gaming weeks and all that good

689
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,120
stuff, send us an email, participate at orange launch radio.com is a great place to do that.

690
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,920
All right.

691
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,520
Let's get into some news.

692
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,880
I would get into housekeeping.

693
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,320
I don't really have anything tonight.

694
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,640
Bobby Black Wolf is going to be off for the next couple of weeks, just for personal vacation

695
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,040
reasons.

696
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:11,000
So we'll be starting, you know, right at nine Eastern, six Pacific VOG.

697
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,280
But as far as our show goes, we don't, you know, it's the holidays.

698
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,520
So the news will be a little less just, but, you know, probably not next week.

699
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,040
The game awards are happening this week.

700
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,320
So I expect we're gonna have a lot of game announcements to dig into next week.

701
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,240
We're not going to be able to do a co-stream of the game awards though, because I have

702
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:27,960
other commitments.

703
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,680
Bobby is working with the aforementioned vacation.

704
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,640
So I just think it's not going to happen this year, but I do hope you all enjoy the game

705
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,140
awards.

706
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,720
I think it'll be interesting.

707
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,880
We'll talk more about the game awards a little later on in the show.

708
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,920
I'm still trying to figure out if we're going to be here on December 25th, which I'm sure

709
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,280
you all know is Christmas day.

710
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,520
I just need to make sure nothing's going on in my family, meaning really Alan's family

711
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,840
is the one we usually do December 25th with.

712
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,200
As soon as I know that, I'll be able to know if I'm going to be here or not.

713
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,280
But Dark Soccer and I have been talking about going out for Chinese food, which used to

714
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,040
be a tradition of sorts.

715
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,160
Then the pandemic happened.

716
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,400
So this would be the first time in a while.

717
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,360
So it'll be good.

718
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:14,840
All right.

719
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,800
We'll see what happens.

720
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,000
We'll see what happens.

721
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,560
All right.

722
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,560
Let's get into some more gaming news.

723
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,560
Because, you know, even though we are in the holidays, this period between Thanksgiving

724
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,040
and, you know, all the December holidays, there's still some gaming news going on.

725
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,720
And of course, the game awards happening this week.

726
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,960
But first off, Loki in the not so great news column.

727
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,520
Yeah, let's talk about harmonics.

728
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,400
So, you know, we're talking about a game shutting down because that's whatever it is that we

729
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,680
talk about harmonics nowadays.

730
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,960
Fuser, they're kind of a DJ mixing sim.

731
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:54,760
The online services for that will be shutting down December 19th.

732
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,600
So a couple of weeks.

733
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:04,440
And basically, you know, the DLC and stuff will still be available until then.

734
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,720
But you'll only be able to play through the campaign in quick play.

735
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,080
You won't be able to play online, obviously.

736
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:17,160
So that's unfortunate, considering that they're bought by Epic.

737
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,920
And I think they have the money to, you know, keep those servers up.

738
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,300
Yeah.

739
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,560
You know, it's well, they are doing their Fortnite now.

740
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,160
Harmonics is a Fortnite company.

741
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:34,840
They've said as much, but the most, you know, it's Alan plays a lot of Fortnite now.

742
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,160
That's like the game he's been playing a lot of lately.

743
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,720
So, you know, I've been picking up on a lot of Fortnite.

744
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,960
You know, I've been picking up on what's going on.

745
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,320
The no build mode really changed Fortnite for the better for a lot of people.

746
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,000
And Alan's one of them.

747
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,200
And even for me, I'm like, oh, yeah, if they took the building crap out of Fortnite, I'd

748
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,000
be interested in it.

749
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,040
So he's going to teach me how to play at some point on a stream.

750
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,320
So we'll do that.

751
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:01,880
But I always thought Fortnite was most fascinating when it did like the concerts and the movie

752
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,320
premieres and the trailer premieres, whatever, and the pop culture stuff.

753
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,840
And we're talking about this a little bit on Bobby show on before us tonight.

754
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,600
I think it's important to state when we talk about the Ariana Grande concert, which I'm

755
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:18,120
sure harmonics or what's left of it had something to do with as it's been absorbed into epic.

756
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,480
The Ariana Grande concert wasn't really a concert.

757
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,680
We keep calling it that.

758
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,000
But it wasn't like you were just standing there watching a fake avatar on the stage,

759
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,080
fake lip syncing to fake songs and stuff.

760
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:29,880
It wasn't what it was.

761
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,200
It was an interactive music video, keyword interactive.

762
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,320
You were the interaction.

763
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,600
And that's what made that kind of neat.

764
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,120
I'll let you go download Bobby show if you want to hear a much longer discussion, because

765
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:48,280
we talked about how honestly when it comes to like meta, the companies or Facebook, if

766
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,040
you will, metaverse, it's a joke.

767
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:57,320
It's literally a joke because it's just trying to bring us something we've seen before.

768
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,640
Whereas say what you will about epic.

769
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:04,120
I'm not always a fan of how Tim Sweeney can touch himself online and some of his tweets

770
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,960
and some of the fights he gets into, even if I will always be a fan of ZZT.

771
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,120
And I do like some of the things that Fortnite is doing.

772
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,000
Bring back ZZT.

773
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,640
Come on, Fortnite season four or five.

774
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,120
Isn't it wild to think that that guy made ZZT?

775
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,920
But then you look at Fortnite and what it's doing.

776
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:28,200
And quite honestly, Loki, you see seeds of that in ZZT.

777
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,120
If you want to go way back, somebody had to have done a YouTube analysis.

778
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,320
Is there some of you YouTube fans?

779
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,480
Is there like a three hour YouTube analysis on how ZZT influenced Fortnite?

780
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,800
Because if there's not, there really should be the same.

781
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,360
I'm just saying like, I know that they tried to push that whole like, I don't remember

782
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,320
what it was called now.

783
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:54,680
It was a platform that was basically unreal, but it was like, oh, I thought you were going

784
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,360
to say ZZT oop.

785
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but there's that too.

786
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:06,920
But like what I'm saying is if they just took ZZT and like, you know, made it kind of polygonal

787
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:11,480
and stuff, but still kind of ZZT where you're building it with blocks.

788
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,520
The super ZZT we were always promised and technically got, but lightning didn't hit

789
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:16,920
twice.

790
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,080
Yeah, no, I'm talking about something more modern than that.

791
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,000
Not like sticking to ASCII characters.

792
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,920
I'm talking about like, you know, still building with blocks and everything, but, you know,

793
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:30,120
and doing maybe even like it'd be the 2D or 2D, you know, over the top types of gameplay

794
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:35,080
still, but like being able to build stuff out of that would be pretty awesome.

795
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,800
Well, and here, you know what's funny?

796
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,640
There's actually, it's funny you bring that up and then I see in chat, I can't see actually

797
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,960
says I just like epic free games.

798
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,800
Ironic that you bring that up because one of the epic free games in the store right

799
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,120
now is an RPG making game.

800
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,200
It's not RPG maker, but a different one.

801
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,360
Somebody will probably yell it out in a chat before I get my epic game store up over here,

802
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,320
but it's actually a make your RPG game.

803
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,240
It's almost exactly what you're describing, Loki, except it's specifically for RPGs.

804
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,920
But otherwise, like it's create your own 3D voxel art type of thing.

805
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:12,520
And like it's literally the free game on the epic store right now until like the 15th.

806
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,880
So it's funny you bring that up because I'm like, actually, that's kind of what's in the

807
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,760
epic store right now.

808
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,720
RPG in a box.

809
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,520
Thank you.

810
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,320
I can't see that is what's called RPG in a box.

811
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,680
So all right.

812
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,200
Jason in chat says I haven't watched any videos, but I found a video with the title.

813
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,000
Why epic games took 25 years to make Fortnite that could have relevance to your idea.

814
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,500
Yes.

815
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,600
Get get the table meme.

816
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,480
Get the table meme.

817
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,040
Here it is.

818
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:43,560
I'm sitting at the table and my banner at the table says Fortnite is just super ZZT.

819
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,280
Change my mind.

820
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,160
Anyway, if you don't know what I know, we keep referencing ZZT and there's

821
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,960
probably many of you out there that are like, what the fuck are they talking about?

822
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:00,680
It was an old, old 90s DOS game that you could that was the most powerful thing about it

823
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:06,920
was creating your own games and what ultimately became other experiences and other like people

824
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:12,280
would basically create journals of their life and things like that inside this ZZT game.

825
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,320
And it was a game.

826
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:17,960
It was big when I was in high school, probably like 95, 94, 95 when this game was out.

827
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,200
And Tim Sweeney made it.

828
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,640
And he's now the CEO of Epic Games.

829
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,880
So basically his company is what brought Fortnite.

830
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,080
Now, again, I don't really like a lot of how Tim Sweeney conducts himself online, but I

831
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:36,440
will always be a fan of ZZT and that stuff, you know, that's and it was hugely influential

832
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,520
to my career as a gamer and the way I grew up in gaming.

833
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:46,120
And Orangewright also says in episode 561 of OLR, we picked it as a classic game.

834
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,280
So I think I did.

835
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:50,760
Did you?

836
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,520
Because I was to say that I don't think I did.

837
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,200
No, no, no, you would.

838
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,400
It was definitely a week you were out and like probably Loki and I were like, what do

839
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,480
we both like ZZT?

840
00:53:59,480 --> 00:53:59,800
All right.

841
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,040
Anyway, let's see.

842
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,960
Other comments in chat.

843
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,240
So S2100 Matt says, I hope harmonics is still there when the music game market blows up

844
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:09,800
again.

845
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,720
My worry is if harmonics gets fully dissolved, like so many of these companies have been

846
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,840
doing with consolidations recently and incorporated in Epic.

847
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,360
Hopefully, hopefully.

848
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,680
Also, I want to point out back to what the story was really about before we got on the

849
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,560
Fortnite thing is about Fuser being sunset.

850
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,680
Shad Leland.

851
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,160
Hi, Shane.

852
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,320
In chat says, man, RIP drop mix again, basically.

853
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,040
Yeah, but I mean, I'm looking at it going.

854
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,160
I didn't really help because I never bought Fuser.

855
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,840
I only played it that one weekend.

856
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:43,240
It was free on Xbox, but I was always waiting for that $20 sale that never came.

857
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:48,200
And to be fair, with all the music licensing in the game, it probably was never able to

858
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:48,760
happen.

859
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:54,440
The game was probably too expensive to fund everything in it for that to ever really happen,

860
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,800
to be quite honest.

861
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,640
So there's that.

862
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,760
DJ Rama S asked, did I read Cliffy B's book yet?

863
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,480
No, it's sitting on my bookshelf, thanks to a very kind donor.

864
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,880
But no, there's a million things to do.

865
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,560
So little time to do them, right?

866
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:16,840
Maybe when I go on vacation to a nice desert island that has no Internet coverage, that'll

867
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,200
be a book I bring with me for sure.

868
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,560
That and my John Waters book.

869
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,280
I want to read them both.

870
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:29,080
And I keep wanting to say Jonathan Taylor Thomas, but that's not his name.

871
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,040
Jonathan Van Ness.

872
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,440
Very different people.

873
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,800
My Jonathan Van Ness book.

874
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,680
Although, have you ever seen the two of them at the same time?

875
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,880
I don't think you have.

876
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,380
All right.

877
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:44,680
Anyway, also with Fuser, here's the thing.

878
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,200
I think it was a great sandbox and you could do really cool things with it.

879
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,440
I don't think the game just didn't make sense.

880
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,760
It wasn't much of a game.

881
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,080
And I understand there was a game there.

882
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,240
I understand some people played it and had fun with it, but I think they just built rules

883
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,840
around sandboxing.

884
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:07,400
And so it was just hard to convince people to pay $60 for a really cool sandbox.

885
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,520
And let's be real, drop mix was a lot of the same thing.

886
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,200
Yes, it was a fun game.

887
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:17,800
If you could get people to actually play it and not just playing with the box until they

888
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,440
were done with it.

889
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:27,080
So I just think it was a cool idea, but it wasn't able to really be fully realized as

890
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:27,560
a game.

891
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,320
Most of the time, people would wear it out as a sandbox, to be honest.

892
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,240
So rest in peace, Fuser.

893
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:40,680
But also when you consider that music licenses are only good for so many years, I mean, it

894
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,800
isn't terribly surprising, but it's sad.

895
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,320
Yeah, but it's not really that the game's not.

896
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,480
I mean, it's just the online services, though.

897
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,800
They're not going to sell the game anymore either, from what I understand.

898
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:56,120
I mean, they can't stop you from walking into a GameStop and buying one used, but it's just

899
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,960
going to drive up the price of the game, that's for sure.

900
00:56:59,320 --> 00:56:59,820
Yeah.

901
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:07,500
All right, let's move on and talk about a new feature that's coming to the PlayStation

902
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,620
5, and that is PlayStation tournaments.

903
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:15,580
So PlayStation tournaments have just been launched by Sony Interactive Entertainment,

904
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,820
and that was announced this week in one of the PlayStation blog posts.

905
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,140
This was already on PlayStation 4.

906
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,340
It's just one of those things that they're catching up with now on the PlayStation 5.

907
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:30,380
It was in beta testing for three months, and now it's going to launch with some other

908
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:36,620
changes, including shorter tournament times, seamless console signup, easily discoverable

909
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:41,260
tournaments, a redone interface, real-time match updates, and more.

910
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:46,700
So some of the first official PlayStation tournaments that will be available on the

911
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:55,420
PlayStation 5 will include Guilty Gear Strive, NBA 2K23, and FIFA 23, just in time for the

912
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:55,920
World Cup.

913
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:01,260
You can play and compete to win prizes among these special events, challenges, leaderboard

914
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,500
competitions, and so forth with the community.

915
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:08,060
I wonder if Stars are a part of that, because PlayStation Stars finally launched, because

916
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,100
I don't fire up my PlayStation all the time, but I did, and I was like, oh, yeah, I got

917
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,140
to sign up for this PlayStation Stars thing that's telling me about.

918
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:18,620
So you can use that to, like, they were literally, you could buy games with that.

919
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,220
Only certain ones, but I thought it was interesting.

920
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:26,540
So Zen Monkey says PlayStation 4 tournaments was shit.

921
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:30,540
They only had a few games, and they took, like, two years to get it working half right.

922
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:34,940
Well, hopefully the implementation on the 5 is a little bit better, but they only did

923
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,700
have it in beta for a few months.

924
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:42,220
So and they did say all of this was from feedback that they got during the beta process.

925
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:48,140
They're also saying that the best PlayStation 5 players will take home accessories like

926
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:52,140
the new DualSense Edge or the Pulse 3D wireless headset.

927
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,020
And if you're a PlayStation 4 owner, you can win a PS5 console.

928
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,300
Maybe this is the only way to get one.

929
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:56,940
No, I'm just kidding.

930
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:03,660
It's apparently getting a lot easier to get a PS5 console, which, by the way, I'm not

931
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,420
getting a PS5 for Christmas.

932
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,220
I just found out.

933
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:09,900
I found out what I am getting for Christmas, but I don't want to say on air yet, but I'm

934
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,980
hoping I'll be able to show you all next week.

935
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,940
So stay tuned for that.

936
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:18,780
But it's not going to be a PlayStation 5 because Alan and I already ruined Christmas for each

937
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,900
other because we do that.

938
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,180
So all right, let's see.

939
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:29,900
The Winathon badge on a tournament card will allow you to sign up and start your leaderboard

940
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,140
for a shot at these various prizes.

941
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,700
So it's interesting that it's all built into the system.

942
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,620
I don't think I'm good enough at games to get very far in any of these tournaments,

943
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,860
but I think it's interesting that that's all set up in there.

944
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:45,100
Plus, I don't play any of those games that were announced there, but nice to finally

945
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,300
have parity with something from the PlayStation 4 on the PlayStation 5.

946
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:53,660
But hopefully to the comment that Zen Monkey 11 said earlier, improving it as well is also

947
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:54,460
very important.

948
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,380
Also, just to follow up to something I said a minute ago, Shane's in chat, Chad Leland

949
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:05,340
saying Fuser sadly is not a physical game, so this does kill it completely.

950
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:10,460
I thought for sure I saw a physical copy of it at a store somewhere once, but I don't

951
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:15,740
am I just embarrassing, bearing, affecting myself right now?

952
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:22,540
I thought for sure I saw that at a GameStop in the Use Games section, but I guess not.

953
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:23,660
Interesting.

954
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,940
Not even on like, was Fuser even on the Switch?

955
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:29,340
I don't think so.

956
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,780
I think it was only an Epic Games store.

957
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:32,860
On PC?

958
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:36,940
Oh, well, I guess it would make sense why when you consider how it all went down with

959
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,060
harmonics, that's for sure.

960
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:39,820
Interesting.

961
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,220
I don't know.

962
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,580
Now I'm going to look, but we have another story to get to first, so I'm going to go

963
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:48,060
to DarkSakura, who's going to talk to us about a big event happening this week.

964
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,460
Indeed, indeed.

965
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:59,100
So, and we do sort of like razz it a little bit, but the Video Game Awards is actually

966
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,220
listening to people's feedback, and they're going to make it shorter.

967
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,380
It's going to be, of course, Thursday, December 8th.

968
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:13,740
And they said that basically, that they're going to make it a little bit shorter.

969
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,820
They won't see anything officially yet.

970
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,180
Actually, I'll just read the rest of the quote.

971
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,180
I won't see anything officially until we're through our rehearsals, but we think it's

972
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,980
going to be a significantly shorter show this year.

973
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:31,260
So they wanted to shorten the runtime because they think that there's fatigue in how long

974
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:36,460
the show has taken in the past, and there's lots of games and a lot of things that want

975
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:40,540
to be a part of it, but they're cutting those things out to streamline the show.

976
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:51,260
They want to highlight fewer of the newer games and just point out the really biggest

977
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:57,020
of them, and they're feeling good about this show.

978
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:02,860
I'm just wondering if it's even some feedback from developers like,

979
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,100
we don't want you to talk about all these other guys.

980
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,060
Just talk about us.

981
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,260
We're giving you most of the money.

982
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:12,460
I think it's probably more feedback from the people he was having to pay overtime to,

983
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:18,380
because I think last year's show went so long that I don't want to say he was in breach

984
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:23,260
of contract, but I think he had to pay extra money because they run it like a legit TV

985
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:23,740
production.

986
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:28,220
He probably was in certain clauses of union agreements in the TV industry and all that

987
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:31,020
stuff where he probably had to pay a lot of extra money because of how long that show

988
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:31,520
went.

989
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,660
That's likely what it boils down to to me.

990
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:38,860
Well, Tekken 8 was confirmed to be there.

991
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,620
There's talks about the Star Wars Jedi survivor.

992
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,540
Something that will not be there is anything on Mortal Kombat.

993
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,180
Basically, they're not going to have anything available, so we'll see.

994
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,900
Um, they also are mentioning in a lot, because we're still getting a lot of the...

995
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,820
We're on the Friends of Jeff Keighley email list or something because we've co-streamed

996
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,700
the Game Awards enough.

997
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,300
They are doing...

998
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,300
Now I'm like, this isn't under NDA.

999
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,620
They wouldn't put it in an email like that because we didn't sign anything.

1000
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:15,420
There's an in-depth look at Dead Space that they're talking about doing as well.

1001
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,660
The Dead Space remake is going to be a part of that.

1002
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,340
So, yeah.

1003
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:24,380
And Bobby and Chad is giving some more of the specifics about saying they had 56 games

1004
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,300
last year, and this year they're going for 30 to 40.

1005
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,220
And honestly, honestly good.

1006
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:31,420
Like, not everything has to be a fucking event.

1007
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,620
You know, I'm fine with it being a tighter show.

1008
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,380
It did go on a little long last year.

1009
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,540
But you know what?

1010
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:43,580
I also understand completely what Zen Monkey 11 and Chad is saying, going, they should

1011
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:46,060
have said, fuck the haters and made it longer.

1012
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:53,580
Like, I also understand the perspective of, hey, this is like games legitimizing night

1013
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,620
or whatever you want to call it.

1014
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:57,100
This is a celebration of games and all that stuff.

1015
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,540
I wish it wouldn't end.

1016
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,140
I wanted to go all night long.

1017
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:04,460
Now, I think because of the union contracts and the number of hours you can work and all

1018
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:09,340
that stuff I just pointed out, that literally can't happen without a lot of money.

1019
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,260
But I understand.

1020
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,820
They do like a second show that's nothing but a showcase.

1021
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:18,460
Yeah, well, summer game fest, but you know, in the winter season.

1022
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,300
Or winter game fest too, come on.

1023
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:25,180
But I also understand there is this whole, it's a yin and yang.

1024
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:31,180
You have to do the premieres to get the eyes to legitimize the award show.

1025
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:36,060
You have to do the award show to legitimize and get people to tune in, you know, or know

1026
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,220
the premieres help people to tune in for the awards.

1027
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:42,220
The awards help the developers and get that prestige that they want to be a part of it

1028
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:43,260
and showcase their premieres.

1029
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,380
It's a yin and yang thing.

1030
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,900
There has to be both, period.

1031
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:52,860
It's just the volume of said yin and yang needs to be rebalanced a little bit.

1032
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,460
I think some are like maybe the things when it comes to like musical performances and

1033
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:56,940
stuff.

1034
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:03,420
Like I like the tradition of the orchestra doing the medley and all that, but they haven't

1035
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,700
teased any performances this year, have they?

1036
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,860
I don't think they really need it.

1037
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:12,540
Like unless you're going to get fucking like Lady Gaga or Beyonce or somebody on that

1038
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,860
level, like, and I love churches.

1039
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:19,900
So I think perform last year, I love churches, but it just, it just makes a long show longer.

1040
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:23,500
And I understand why they just need to cut it down a little bit.

1041
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:28,940
S2100 Matt says a sponsor like Verizon or whoever isn't going to pay for ads at hours

1042
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:33,020
three and four for a long award show because they know not a lot of folks are still tuning

1043
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:33,820
in at that point.

1044
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,660
Well, don't forget the commercials you are.

1045
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:41,740
I was going to say a lot of the premieres and a lot of the things you do see in between.

1046
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:44,860
There are commercials very slyly stuck in there.

1047
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,780
Don't forget that about the game awards.

1048
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:51,660
They very much put commercials that look like premieres or for things that are already out.

1049
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,380
They very much will have that woven in there.

1050
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,780
I guarantee it because they do everything.

1051
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:58,460
Yeah, promotional spots to promote.

1052
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,140
Absolutely.

1053
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:00,780
Absolutely.

1054
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,060
E3VL says orchestra is only good if you're live.

1055
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:04,540
Well, guess what?

1056
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,980
They're bringing it back live this year.

1057
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:11,180
They were selling tickets to go to the LA event and they're doing an IMAX theater thing.

1058
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,380
If I remember right as well.

1059
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:19,500
So they're, they're, they're doing, you know, a lot of different ways to get it out there.

1060
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:23,500
But anyway, I know we have some other follow ups on the game awards.

1061
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:27,180
So let me get to these other stories that are some other things related to the game

1062
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:27,580
awards.

1063
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,080
Loki.

1064
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,460
Loki, you with us?

1065
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:33,740
Yeah.

1066
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,380
Oh, no.

1067
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,100
Other other things about the game awards.

1068
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:38,480
Yeah.

1069
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:44,460
Um, so there's lots of cool stuff, like including, uh, valve, giving away steam decks one per

1070
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,180
minute.

1071
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,620
How fancy is that?

1072
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:51,980
Um, so yeah, you, I guess I'm not sure how you would do that.

1073
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:56,860
I guess if you register maybe through their site, um, yeah, through valve streaming site.

1074
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:03,340
Uh, so if you watch the game awards through there, then you'll have a chance to win one

1075
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:09,180
per minute, which is, I think about, I think they said like almost 180 steam decks is what

1076
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,380
they're looking to give away.

1077
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:14,060
So they just told you how much shorter the show is going to be than years past.

1078
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:17,580
Just, just so we're clear that valve just told you how, how much shorter they're making

1079
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:18,220
the show this year.

1080
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,540
Yeah.

1081
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,380
So, um, pretty awesome.

1082
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:30,780
And then, um, one other thing that is, or not coming is an announcement by Ed Boon.

1083
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:37,020
He has said that he is, he's announced that he is not announcing anything, so it'll be

1084
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:40,300
a very, I guess.

1085
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,580
Um, cool.

1086
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,020
I wait a little bit longer.

1087
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,460
I believe the background on that.

1088
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,980
Cause, uh, dark soccer referenced it too.

1089
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:52,460
The background on that is, uh, that on the Xbox store, on the website, one of the two,

1090
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:56,700
there was a, um, SGA 100 mat says announcement of no announcement.

1091
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:01,100
There's a reason for that because on the Xbox store, there was a nether realm studios,

1092
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,420
like listing that suddenly showed up.

1093
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:07,340
And I think it had a name and it wasn't, it could have been a project name or something

1094
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,420
because it wasn't tied to any existing IP.

1095
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:14,220
But anyway, people assumed they jumped to the conclusion that Microsoft listed something

1096
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,940
early that was supposed to be premiered at the game awards.

1097
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:20,540
Uh, so this is why another realm is coming out and saying you didn't see anything.

1098
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:23,020
We're not premiering anything at the game awards.

1099
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:29,980
To be, to be fair, he said, no, we aren't announcing the next injustice or moral combat

1100
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:30,620
next week.

1101
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:31,260
Sorry.

1102
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:31,820
Okay.

1103
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:32,460
Okay.

1104
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:38,060
So new IP, maybe, you know what?

1105
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,700
Just fucking wait till Thursday at this point.

1106
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,980
I'm not going to try to read the tea leaves.

1107
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,180
I'm just going to wait till Thursday.

1108
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:51,020
Um, somebody who needs to fucking do something on Thursday is Hideo Kojima.

1109
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:55,820
And I fully expect we'll do something on Thursday because this tease it's, it's officially

1110
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:57,180
gone on too long.

1111
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,460
And you know what?

1112
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:03,100
I don't, I know I don't get to give out game awards, but I do think there is an award that

1113
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:06,460
needs to be given out every year for shit or get off the pot.

1114
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:11,100
And Hideo Kojima would win it this year because there is that whole fact.

1115
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:15,740
Sometimes you tease a game too much, or you tease a thing too much.

1116
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,700
You need to shit or get off the pot.

1117
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:22,780
That's what Hideo Kojima needs to do when it comes to his next project.

1118
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:29,180
But in classic Hideo Kojima form, a new teaser hit his Twitter account this week that invites

1119
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:32,940
viewers to start a new journey with three mysterious symbols.

1120
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,620
Some folks are wondering, is this Death Stranding 2?

1121
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,060
Is this the game that has Elle fanning?

1122
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:43,100
Is Death Stranding 2 also a horror game?

1123
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,500
Because that's been rumored for some time.

1124
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:51,260
But there's one of the logos, the APAC, the automated public assistance company that off

1125
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:55,180
that sounds like something that could be like a Death Stranding 2 type of thing.

1126
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,140
I don't know.

1127
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,780
This symbol was also present in the fanning teaser.

1128
01:09:58,780 --> 01:09:59,100
I'm sorry.

1129
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,620
One of the other symbols is also present in the fanning teaser.

1130
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,900
And of course we all heard about that video that leaked.

1131
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:12,780
So, but whatever Kojima is working on, it is officially time for him to show it.

1132
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:17,020
But now here's the good news where all this is going.

1133
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:22,300
Hideo Kojima is absolutely besties with Jeff Keighley.

1134
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:26,460
And if he's going to announce something, he will do it at the Game Awards.

1135
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:33,420
And there probably is a nice, there's no more Elden Ring teases to be done unless there's

1136
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,420
an Elden Ring 2, God help us all.

1137
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:39,340
Actually, there's a lot of fans that game who'd really love that, but it's not happening

1138
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:39,980
this year.

1139
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:40,940
Not happening this year.

1140
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:44,220
So what's going to take that last spot at the Game Awards?

1141
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:47,180
I think Hideo Kojima, here you go.

1142
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,300
It's go time.

1143
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:49,020
Do something.

1144
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,060
But I look forward to it.

1145
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:54,860
I loved a lot of what Death Stranding was trying to do.

1146
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:59,660
I maybe didn't get through the game start to finish, but I think a lot of that game really

1147
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:02,140
hit hard because of when it came out.

1148
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:05,980
I know Dark Sakura followed a lot of Death Stranding and a lot of like the characters

1149
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:06,380
and stuff.

1150
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,500
And you were into this too.

1151
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:13,020
What are your thoughts about like a sequel possibly happening in that world?

1152
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:17,500
It'll be another game to watch because I didn't play it.

1153
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,140
I watched it.

1154
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:25,580
No, but it's so either whether you're being serious or telling a joke, either applies

1155
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:26,860
to be honest.

1156
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:33,020
Because yeah, Death Stranding just came out on Xbox Game Pass for PC.

1157
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:34,220
So I checked it out again.

1158
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:39,020
And it was like an hour and a half before I actually got to move a character.

1159
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:43,340
Because that is a Hideo Kojima production.

1160
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,460
Trademark, patent pending.

1161
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,860
Anyway, let's move on.

1162
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:51,900
Something we won't see at the Game Awards, I don't think.

1163
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,620
Dark Sakura.

1164
01:11:54,620 --> 01:12:02,380
Well, you know, going back to previous statements about Activision Blizzard.

1165
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:08,460
And they're in office and out of office issues.

1166
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:20,620
The army actually basically killed a marketing effort working with Activision Blizzard for

1167
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:26,620
Call of Duty after the whole gender discrimination, sexual assault lawsuits.

1168
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:30,060
It was confirmed just this past Thursday.

1169
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:37,340
They had a massive marketing campaign that had Call of Duty at the core of it.

1170
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:39,340
And now they're like, no.

1171
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:47,020
They had a direct partnership with Activision Blizzard for sponsoring its esports team,

1172
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,620
the Call of Duty League.

1173
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:51,100
All of it's been cut off now.

1174
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:56,220
And the official statement is the army has no current relationship with Activision.

1175
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:00,540
The army sponsorship of Call of Duty League, produced by Activision Blizzard, was set

1176
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,940
to expire in August of 2021.

1177
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:05,100
However, in light of...

1178
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,060
Wait, how old is this?

1179
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:07,820
Okay, never mind.

1180
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:11,980
I was talking about all the 2021 stuff.

1181
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,820
It's been going on that long.

1182
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:14,380
Yeah.

1183
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:19,100
However, in light of the development surrounding California Department of Fair Employment and

1184
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:23,820
the housing lawsuit, etc., etc., we paused activities ahead of the expiration date and

1185
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,100
chose not to renew.

1186
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:31,100
And so just go...

1187
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:40,380
There's like, again, repeats of some of the bullshit from Activision's spokesperson, just

1188
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:45,660
all kinds of things, but they are looking completely to make that...

1189
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,260
Okay, I see what the issue now.

1190
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:52,300
This is actually, it is an older story and I misread that, but they updated it with the

1191
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:59,900
information from Activision saying that they were shocked by it.

1192
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:00,400
They...

1193
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:07,580
The quote is saying that no court in California found anything to substantiate, which is bullshit.

1194
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:15,660
But it's just showing that we're still seeing the repercussions of it today and they need

1195
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:16,700
to keep holding them accountable.

1196
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:22,620
And it's also a way in which a lot of the discourse, for lack of a better term, online

1197
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:29,100
led to this, where other companies don't necessarily want to be associated with it.

1198
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,340
Look at what Twitter is going through.

1199
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,940
I love to pick on Twitter right now.

1200
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:36,620
Look at what Twitter is going through right now with advertisers and how there's many

1201
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:37,100
people.

1202
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:42,860
And now the current owner of Twitter wants to do the name them and shame them approach

1203
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:48,620
for advertisers, because that's always worked in trying to get advertisers on board with

1204
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:50,700
your platform is to pick a fight.

1205
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:51,500
But I digress.

1206
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:57,340
If the army really wanted to make good at it, they would be doing some cleaning in house

1207
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:58,220
as well.

1208
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,060
They're not innocent.

1209
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:04,700
The army is not in the position to be playing morality police.

1210
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,260
I get that.

1211
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:14,380
And on exactly the same things, tons of people are silenced for sexual assault allegations.

1212
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:26,700
What about Vanessa Guillen, who they basically found her dead in a riverbed after she had

1213
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:30,940
made some complaints of sexual harassment.

1214
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,340
Very good point.

1215
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:37,180
I'm just saying we're seeing also a lot of the pot calling the kettle black.

1216
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:40,380
So all right.

1217
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:47,180
Well, let's move on and talk about some new information that's come out this week on another

1218
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:47,500
game.

1219
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,100
Loki, yes.

1220
01:15:49,100 --> 01:16:00,860
So apparently the ratings for Final Fantasy 16 have been discovered on the Brazilian game

1221
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:08,380
rating board, and it kind of gives us an idea of and probably begin to be mature rated here

1222
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,820
in North America.

1223
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:15,420
But we know what their ratings are based on right now, the different criteria.

1224
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:23,020
So it lists that the game will feature sex scenes, not fully shown, intentional deaths,

1225
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:30,700
torture scenes depicting suffering victims, drug use, prostitution, sexual content.

1226
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:32,460
And hate crimes.

1227
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:33,980
Hold on.

1228
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:35,660
Drug use in a Final Fantasy game?

1229
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:37,580
Are we going to smoke the chocobo grass?

1230
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:41,420
Is that how does drug use factor in a Final Fantasy game?

1231
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,060
Just injecting that material, I guess.

1232
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,300
Pestle on those geisha greens.

1233
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:55,260
I'm very curious to see, are they going to stick to the only the drugs that were available

1234
01:16:55,260 --> 01:17:00,300
in ancient medieval times since they're trying to use that as excuse for other things?

1235
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:06,140
Are we only it's only going to be 100% only going to be absent or I don't even know what

1236
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:09,100
the fuck they got high off of back in those times.

1237
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:13,500
They'll pick something up 100% accurate to medieval times.

1238
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:20,140
Anyway, so when we say that Final Fantasy 16 is getting its influence from Game of Thrones,

1239
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:23,420
we mean in every fashion.

1240
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,220
I can't wait for the end.

1241
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:28,620
Oh my God.

1242
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:29,820
Is there going to be a red wedding?

1243
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:31,180
See anything about incest?

1244
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,620
There's so much.

1245
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:41,340
I think Square realized maybe there were some lines they shouldn't cross, but I'm very curious

1246
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:45,740
to see what Final Fantasy 16's red wedding scene is going to be.

1247
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:48,620
Because now I'm you're hearing a lot.

1248
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:50,700
I'm like all this Game of Thrones influence.

1249
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,660
I'm like, there's gonna be a red wedding scene in Final Fantasy 16.

1250
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,180
Just fucking wait for it.

1251
01:17:55,180 --> 01:18:00,220
As long as they actually bring her back as the undead instead of just leaving her dead.

1252
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,300
Like she was in the book.

1253
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:02,860
Just saying.

1254
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:03,340
We need it.

1255
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:04,860
We need more vengeful undead.

1256
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,940
Well, we have vengeful.

1257
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:08,380
What do they call?

1258
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:13,100
I want to say summons, but they're called eidolons, eidolons, titans.

1259
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,780
I don't remember what they're calling them in 16.

1260
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:17,580
But you know, basically that we have those vengeful spirits.

1261
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,700
So we'll see.

1262
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,300
Aerith, what are you doing here?

1263
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:27,740
Oh, DJ Rama says a red wedding scene done to the Final Fantasy six opera scene.

1264
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:28,620
You're welcome.

1265
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:31,100
Hey, you know what?

1266
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:33,820
I mean, as long as it's tastefully done, I guess.

1267
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:39,580
If one, if Yoshi, if Yoshi P knows how to do one thing in Final Fantasy, he knows how

1268
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:44,140
to do a fucking callback to the earlier games and something they haven't tried to do in

1269
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,860
14 yet is do the opera scene.

1270
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:49,740
So you joke is just going to be just.

1271
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:54,220
You, you joke Rama, but the stage is set.

1272
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:57,180
My friend, the stage is set literally.

1273
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,060
So we'll see what happens.

1274
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:00,060
We'll see what happens by the way.

1275
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:04,620
That's because I believe they've said that, um, now Kiyoshita is going to be at the game

1276
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,740
awards either as a presenter or some type of fashion.

1277
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,420
Ken and Roberta Williams are going to be there as well.

1278
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:11,580
By the way, I noticed, uh, that came out too.

1279
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:17,260
Now, granted, um, Ken and Roberta Williams are working on a, uh, a reboot of their very

1280
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:21,660
first game for VR, uh, that all started during COVID cause they couldn't travel.

1281
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,340
So, um, they're doing that.

1282
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:27,420
So they have, but they're presenting, but now Kiyoshita is going to be there.

1283
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,340
So I wonder why.

1284
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:30,480
Hmm.

1285
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:32,400
Anyway.

1286
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:33,980
All right.

1287
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:40,620
Uh, moving on next story, uh, for me, and it has to do with Twitch and, uh, you know,

1288
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:42,380
yeah, further chat.

1289
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:46,620
Well, yeah, if you're a broadcaster on Twitch, this has been like highlighted and spotlit

1290
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,460
for you, even here on the VOG account.

1291
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:53,260
When I logged in for the first time in a little bit today, uh, I got, uh, to see this and

1292
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:56,460
that is the new shield mode that they have put on Twitch.

1293
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:59,260
This is part of hate raid protection.

1294
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:05,660
Um, now I don't, I don't want to sound naive, but I haven't seen a Twitch hate raid in a

1295
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:06,460
while.

1296
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:11,100
Uh, uh, I I'm hoping that means that people are losing interest in them.

1297
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:19,420
A few people have, um, there's some who's reporting that people are like gifting subs

1298
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:24,620
or making a sub just so that they can have a voice if they have voice to chat enabled

1299
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:30,140
so that it will be like, and one of the people, um, was like, yeah, I just thanked them for

1300
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:31,340
the money and then they quit.

1301
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:32,860
Got it.

1302
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:35,580
So people are just finding new ways to be shitty, basically.

1303
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:41,980
You know what I did have been happening, but weekly, I did see that happen on somebody's

1304
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:47,420
feed, but I'm at the same mindset where I'm like, you just gave them $2 and 50 cents to

1305
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:49,260
be a, be a dumbling.

1306
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:50,540
And then that's, that's it.

1307
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:53,740
Like, I don't understand paid to be a Dick.

1308
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:55,500
Yeah, it's, it's weird.

1309
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:56,300
Okay.

1310
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:56,540
Yeah.

1311
01:20:56,540 --> 01:21:01,180
And I don't, I also, I don't want to be like naive or say just because I don't see it means

1312
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:02,060
it's not happening.

1313
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:05,660
I just want to say I, it doesn't seem to be as widespread.

1314
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,500
I'm not seeing the social media buzz.

1315
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,340
I mean, granted, I'm, I'm on a site with a lot fewer people now and I used to be, but

1316
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:14,860
I'm not seeing that type of buzz and that sort of thing that I was seeing months ago

1317
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:15,660
with it.

1318
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:16,140
A dark to see.

1319
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:18,300
It does say me, she says they do happen.

1320
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,780
She seen them on some of her favorite streamers.

1321
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:21,820
Yeah, I got it.

1322
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:25,980
Tiger class says $2 is chump change to them, which is why they probably did it.

1323
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,820
Hey, actually it's $5 to them.

1324
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:31,260
It's just the streamer gets two 50 and Twitch gets the other two 50.

1325
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,380
But I digress multiple times, but I digress.

1326
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:38,060
Twitch did add a shield mode this week.

1327
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:43,500
It's a one button toggle and it will activate several customizable safety features all at

1328
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:49,020
once you or your moderators can press it and it will limit chat to followers or subscribers,

1329
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:54,780
require verification and implement stricter auto mod levels and immediately revert back

1330
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:55,820
to looser policies.

1331
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:58,940
Once you are in the clear and you unshield basically.

1332
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:02,300
So it's literally casting a shield on your stream in many ways.

1333
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:04,860
There's a pair of different defenses.

1334
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:09,900
You can also automatically ban everyone who used a given phrase in chat recently.

1335
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:14,700
That's nice because if people do come in spamming the same phrase, you just ban them all at

1336
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,580
once or you can disallow first time chatters.

1337
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,980
You can silence people with a click.

1338
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:24,300
You can if you want to file reports though, you have to do that one at a time, but hopefully

1339
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:26,540
that process will be streamlined in the future.

1340
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,500
So that's pretty neat.

1341
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:28,540
Yes.

1342
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:31,340
There were a few things about it that kept me from enabling it though.

1343
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,540
It wasn't tweakable enough.

1344
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:37,500
Does that make sense?

1345
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:37,900
Yeah, sure.

1346
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:38,940
You want it a certain way.

1347
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:39,440
I get it.

1348
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:40,460
Yeah.

1349
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:45,980
But it's nice that that's there by default for maybe the people who are newer to streaming

1350
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:49,820
because for like, you know, you, me and many of our friends, we've all been streaming a

1351
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:50,700
long time now.

1352
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:54,220
So we all kind of came up with our own way to defend against this stuff.

1353
01:22:54,220 --> 01:23:01,500
But the thing we need more of on Twitch is we need to invite more people, more different

1354
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:09,900
races and ethnicities, more sexualities, more women, more by gender, a gender and other

1355
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:14,140
genders that are out there, more people all over all the different types of spectrums

1356
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:18,300
we have in this world to be streaming on this platform.

1357
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,700
And the nice thing is a shield is something that's there by default now so that even

1358
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:26,300
somebody new to streaming can push the button if they get targeted.

1359
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:31,020
Something else added on there that I heard someone mention about, but I was just checking

1360
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:35,660
my creator dashboard and there's the option to stop raids for an hour.

1361
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:37,740
Oh, interesting.

1362
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,980
That you can add to your quick actions.

1363
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:44,460
And I know that some people have been using it at the end of their stream so they don't

1364
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:45,820
feel obligated.

1365
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,540
If that makes sense.

1366
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:49,020
Oh, that's smart.

1367
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:49,580
I get it.

1368
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:50,060
Yeah.

1369
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:52,220
Because how much is that?

1370
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:53,660
I always feel super obligated.

1371
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:54,860
Yes, same.

1372
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:55,900
Actually, that's legit.

1373
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,340
I don't know about an hour, but I think like 30 minutes would be great.

1374
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:02,220
Like to not allow raids because you're wrapping up.

1375
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:03,660
That's smart.

1376
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,340
But you know what?

1377
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:10,620
Twitchies takes that one step further and actually tell people you're disabling raids

1378
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:14,460
because you're wrapping up so that people still will try to rage you in the future.

1379
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:18,140
Because I know I've tried to raid people and they have their rage just disabled.

1380
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:20,860
And I go, oh, well, I guess I can't raid that person ever again.

1381
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:23,900
But now that I know this is a thing, I'll keep that in mind.

1382
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,060
So that's a pretty smart feature, though.

1383
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:27,900
All right.

1384
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:29,340
You know what?

1385
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:35,180
We're going to go back in our next segment to a time long before we needed to shield

1386
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:35,980
button on Twitch.

1387
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:36,620
That's for sure.

1388
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:53,340
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull

1389
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,660
out a classic and tell you about it.

1390
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:58,300
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1391
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,060
Today's classic electronic handheld is the gaming watch.

1392
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:11,420
It was designed by Gunpei Yokoi after seeing a board businessman on the Shinkansen play

1393
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,780
with an LCD calculator.

1394
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:19,180
After a meeting with Nintendo's president, Hiroshi Yamauchi and the CEO of Sharp Corporation

1395
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,020
has given the green light to develop this concept.

1396
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:27,660
Yokoi adapted the simple controls of Donkey Kong, creating a cross-shaped D-pad into the

1397
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:29,340
first model to create ball.

1398
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:34,220
From there, the series continued from 1980 to 1991.

1399
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:38,140
The last game made for it was Mario the Juggler.

1400
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:45,100
A side note, this cross-shaped D-pad created by Yokoi earned a technology and engineering

1401
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:45,820
Emmy award.

1402
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:52,700
There are different configurations of the gaming watch over time, including dual screen

1403
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:59,100
clamshell models, the inspiration for the Game Boy Advance SP, the DS and the 3DS.

1404
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:07,420
Not to mention that there were a bajillion different colors and layouts like panorama,

1405
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:12,460
super color, micro versus system, crystal screen, color screen, silver, gold, you name

1406
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:12,620
it.

1407
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:20,540
The games themselves typically had a game A and a game B. The B version was usually

1408
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:22,060
a lot harder.

1409
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:28,300
There were some exceptions, like for example, the big notable ones were Judge Boxing, Donkey

1410
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,980
Kong 3, and Donkey Kong Hockey.

1411
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,740
The game B was a two player version.

1412
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:36,860
There were 60 different game and watch games produced for sale.

1413
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:42,860
There was one still for sale and one that was only available as a contest prize, making

1414
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:44,300
62 total.

1415
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:51,500
The prize game was given to winners of Nintendo's F1 brand pre-tournament, and it was a yellow

1416
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:56,380
cased version of Super Mario Brothers that came in a plastic box modeled after Discon.

1417
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:58,540
It was used to advertise the Famicom Disk System.

1418
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:04,860
They only made about 10,000 units and it was never available for retail, so it's considered

1419
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:05,500
pretty rare.

1420
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:11,740
The Game and Watch series sold 14 million units worldwide during its first year.

1421
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:17,340
The Game and Watch version of Donkey Kong released in 1982 sold 8 million units.

1422
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:22,860
Mario the Juggler, which was released in 1991, was the last game created for it.

1423
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:29,500
There's also a game called Headache, and it's the UK version of Helmet that's devoid

1424
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:32,780
of vulgar connotations of the word in Europe.

1425
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:39,420
The title is really hard to find because of region isolation, and it was released under

1426
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:45,980
CGL in the UK, and it could be probably one of the rarest of the Game and Watch games.

1427
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:54,060
And the one Judge in 1980 had two different color schemes, purple and green.

1428
01:27:56,620 --> 01:28:05,980
There were a number of re-releases between 1995 and 2002 with the Game and Watch series

1429
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:10,140
after five Game and Watch collections that were released for Game Boy, Game Boy Color,

1430
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:10,940
and Game Boy Advance.

1431
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:17,340
They had the original ports as well as modernized versions with the Mario series cast.

1432
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:25,580
1998 onward, there were third-party distributors who were licensed to release smaller LCD versions

1433
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:30,380
of Game and Watch that composed the Nintendo Mini Classic series.

1434
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:38,620
2001, Nintendo released Manhole E that was bundled with the E-Reader series.

1435
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:45,340
And although there were a whole series of Game and Watch E-Reader cards planned, they

1436
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:46,460
were never released.

1437
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:54,780
Between July 2006 and March 2010, Nintendo produced two Game and Watch collector's cartridges

1438
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:59,260
for the DS to be released exclusively for club Nintendo members.

1439
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:04,620
The first cartridge featured three games from Game and Watch multi-screen series, which

1440
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,700
was Oil Panic, Donkey Kong, and Greenhouse.

1441
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:14,220
The second collection, too, contained Parachute, Octopus, and a Noodle Screen game with Parachute

1442
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,660
on the top and Octopus on the bottom.

1443
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:18,940
Both cartridges are now available to the public.

1444
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:27,100
Between July 2009 and April 2010, they released nine separate Game and Watch ports for DSiWare,

1445
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:34,700
including remakes of Ball, Flagman, Manhole, Mario's Cement Factory, and others.

1446
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:41,420
In March 2010, Takara Tomy released Game and Watch keychains.

1447
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:46,940
Well, style keychains, anyway, based on the widescreen versions of Octopus, Parachute,

1448
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:47,440
and Chef.

1449
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,540
They don't actually play the games, but just have a demo screen.

1450
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:54,140
They're just there to be looked at.

1451
01:29:54,940 --> 01:30:00,140
Ball was released exclusively via club Nintendo for the 30th anniversary of Game and Watch

1452
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:02,540
with the club Nintendo logo on the back.

1453
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:07,260
Unlike the original, this one includes a mute switch, which is great,

1454
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:11,420
for members of Japanese club Nintendo.

1455
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:15,740
After the announcement November 2009, it was shipped in April 2010 to platinum members.

1456
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:22,860
For members of the North American club Nintendo, it was available for 1200 coins from February

1457
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,460
2011.

1458
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:29,180
And for Europe, there were 7500 stars from November 2011.

1459
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:37,260
On September 3, 2020, Nintendo announced a limited Game and Watch system that had full

1460
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:43,340
NES versions of Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. Lost Levels, known as Super Mario

1461
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:48,780
Bros. 2 in Japan, along with a variant of Ball with Mario's head or Luigi's head with

1462
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:51,420
cheat code, replacing the original character's head.

1463
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:57,820
It was named Game and Watch Super Mario Bros., released on November 13, 2020.

1464
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:04,300
And this one was charged via USB-C cable instead of the button batteries.

1465
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:09,340
After that, we had The Legend of Zelda on June 15, 2021.

1466
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:13,420
It was released, not released, but revealed for the 35th anniversary.

1467
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:19,020
We had four games, Legend of Zelda, Zelda 2, Adventures of Link, Legend of Zelda Link's

1468
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:23,820
Awakening, and a variant of Vermin, with Link replacing the original character's head.

1469
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:26,380
That was released on November 12, 2021.

1470
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:34,780
The system itself was pretty influential over the handheld market.

1471
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:39,740
Many different toy companies followed that, including Tiger Electronics with their Star

1472
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:40,380
Wars games.

1473
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:47,660
And each of these little units, basically, these were the precursors of Game Boy.

1474
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:53,900
The cartridge system incorporated into that with the screen and everything.

1475
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:59,740
Again, Yokoi's invention pretty much rendered the Game & Watch obsolete.

1476
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:06,220
At any rate, there's also Game & Watch Gallery, where you can watch the games' videos.

1477
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,220
They imitate the LCD displays.

1478
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:12,860
Again, like I said, they had been re-released through DSiWare.

1479
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:17,260
There's a DS release of Cooking Guide, Can't Decide What to Eat.

1480
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:21,100
You can unlock both A and B versions of Chef if you use the timer function.

1481
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:26,940
Nintendo Land for Wii U has a minigame called Octopus Dance based off of the game Octopus.

1482
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:33,180
And Game & Wario for Wii U, which is a play of words on Game & Watch, has many different

1483
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:39,500
references to the Game & Watch line, including a Virtual Game & Watch version of Puyo called

1484
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:39,820
Bird.

1485
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:46,140
This also led us to Mr. Game & Watch, who became a very popular Smash Brothers character.

1486
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:55,900
He was redefined and redesigned to make him work in a 3D environment, but he is purely

1487
01:32:55,900 --> 01:33:04,540
two-dimensional and he uses the sound equivalent of the sounds from the Game & Watch games,

1488
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:05,820
which you'll hear in the video.

1489
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:13,340
And of course, we got the Amiibo version, where he has different versions of the character

1490
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:15,580
that you can reattach for different poses.

1491
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:23,580
And he can be scanned and create a personal CPU that can train and fight using artificial

1492
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:24,140
intelligence.

1493
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:29,500
The Amiibo is also used to unlock a cosmetic option for Super Mario Maker.

1494
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:32,060
And there you go.

1495
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:33,500
That is the Game & Watch.

1496
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:37,500
And it's a pretty long history.

1497
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:40,300
All right, there it is.

1498
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:47,900
The Game & Watch, the final classic handheld of the month for this year, as I typically

1499
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:52,780
do in December, because we've done a little twist on this classic game segment for quite

1500
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:53,980
a while ever since.

1501
01:33:53,980 --> 01:34:01,020
I think the first year was, and I have to refer to our Wiki to remind me, 2017 was the

1502
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:02,380
classic console of the month.

1503
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:06,300
2018 was the classic peripheral of the month.

1504
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:09,820
2019 was the classic 8-bit soundtrack of the month.

1505
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:13,180
2020 was classic pinball of the month.

1506
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:18,540
2021 was, oh, I love this one, the flag, the fucking weird arcade game, the flag of the

1507
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:18,700
month.

1508
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,580
That was actually really hard to do.

1509
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:20,540
That was a lot of fun.

1510
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:21,580
That was a lot of fun.

1511
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,100
It was hard, though, to find material.

1512
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:23,580
Oh, it was.

1513
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,700
It was, but you had a good list.

1514
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:31,420
And then 2022, the classic handheld electronic game of the month, starting off in January

1515
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:38,860
with Tron, February with electronic football by Mattel, March with the game.com system,

1516
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:47,100
April with the Puyo Lin, May with the Tamagotchi, June with the Digimon electronic handheld,

1517
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:54,460
July with Bandai Terror House, August with the Cosmic 1000 Fire Away, September with

1518
01:34:54,460 --> 01:35:01,260
the Tommytronic 3D series, October with the Coleco tabletop arcade collection, November

1519
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:03,580
with the Nelsonic game watches.

1520
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:07,500
And then finally, of course, of course, you knew when the segment was announced, this

1521
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:11,980
one was coming at some point, the Game & Watch, capping it off in December.

1522
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:16,540
You know, I have to ask, are we and I know we've talked about it previously.

1523
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:19,260
Did we decide finally on a 2023 theme?

1524
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:20,940
Were we going to roll with that cage match theme?

1525
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:21,820
Because I love that one.

1526
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:23,340
But it's up to you, really.

1527
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:28,220
I do like the cage match idea that it's going to take work.

1528
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,500
Yeah, I think.

1529
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:35,660
And part of me wants to table that for like a special thing.

1530
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:37,820
Oh, like a like a bonus stream.

1531
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:42,220
You know, we owe our listeners a bonus stream from a year ago still, but completely my fault.

1532
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:43,980
But I love that maybe as a bonus stream.

1533
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:44,540
That could be fun.

1534
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:54,460
Well, and what I'm thinking about doing instead is the classic 80s toy.

1535
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,420
Oh, interesting.

1536
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:58,860
Like toy lines.

1537
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:04,940
Oh, so departing the realm of video games, but maybe not because there's a lot of 80s

1538
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:07,420
toys that in turn ended up influencing games.

1539
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:13,420
So or, you know, on the same same thing I could do.

1540
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:19,900
No, no, I'm trying to think of like specific.

1541
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:25,900
My thought is board game or card game, because there's a lot of that stuff that comes over.

1542
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:26,620
But I don't know.

1543
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:27,180
It's up to you.

1544
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:31,820
There's some that have just been like classics already, you know, that were out before then,

1545
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:34,460
like the original Cluedo, for example.

1546
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:35,280
Sure.

1547
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:43,020
You know, going back to old battleship, you know, I could maybe I could do very specifically

1548
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:48,060
games from the 80s, like physical games.

1549
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:50,140
You know what that means, though?

1550
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:52,540
Crossfire.

1551
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:55,100
All right, well, I'll let you marinate on it.

1552
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,700
Don't don't finalize.

1553
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:58,220
No, I'm going to do that.

1554
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:00,380
Do you do 80s board games?

1555
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:04,300
Board games are interactive games.

1556
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,700
Competitive games and no magic.

1557
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:11,180
Magic, I think was 89 card games are not going to go into it.

1558
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:11,680
Okay.

1559
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:12,880
All right.

1560
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:13,740
That's it.

1561
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:14,220
That's it.

1562
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:16,300
So put it on the wiki.

1563
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:16,940
It's coming up.

1564
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:18,940
Now I got to watch all this crossfire commercials.

1565
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:19,440
Yeah.

1566
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,000
All right.

1567
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:26,060
All right, let's move around the industry quickly at a rapid pace and talk about what

1568
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:28,620
else is going on in rapid fire news.

1569
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:29,420
We'll start with Loki.

1570
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:35,500
So Fortnite chapter three has just ended, and now we have the tease for chapter four.

1571
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:39,500
And we know some of the things that are going to be coming into that as well.

1572
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:44,220
First off, they're going to be updating the graphics of the game.

1573
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:47,980
It's going to be running on unreal 5.1, which looks pretty awesome.

1574
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:54,780
And then along with that, though, we have teases for Doom guy, Gerald from the Witcher

1575
01:37:54,780 --> 01:38:08,300
series, and Azuki Midoriya, I don't know why I couldn't say that from what was that?

1576
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:10,140
It was My Hero Academia.

1577
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:18,380
And also, I believe there was cameos, at least as part of the cut scene from chapter three

1578
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:19,660
of Hulk.

1579
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:22,940
And then also there's dirt bikes in there now.

1580
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:24,060
And Mr. Beast.

1581
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:28,300
It's just an amalgamation of like all sorts of weird stuff.

1582
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:35,500
It's like the multi or like it's like Ready Player One almost at this point, kind of.

1583
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:38,860
And then this is kind of funny.

1584
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:42,540
So Uncharted is getting a roller coaster.

1585
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:43,820
That's right.

1586
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:46,940
It's not coming to a park, at least near me.

1587
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:57,580
But in, I guess, Port Aventura world, they're going to be getting a ride based off of Uncharted

1588
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,820
and that's going to be in Spain.

1589
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:04,700
It's their largest theme park there, and it's coming out middle of next year.

1590
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:09,900
And apparently it's a dark ride roller coaster.

1591
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:11,580
Well, it sounds like fun fun.

1592
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:15,500
Oh, yeah, that makes me think of like the mummy at Universal.

1593
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,260
Hollywood is a dark ride roller coaster.

1594
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:18,060
That's a lot of fun.

1595
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:19,360
Yeah.

1596
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:23,340
I'll never forget the first time I rode that ride with Exeter, and we had no idea what

1597
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:25,500
to expect when the thing started going backwards.

1598
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:30,300
We screamed so loud that like we were crying, but it was a lot of fun.

1599
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:32,460
Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1600
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:34,940
A couple of things.

1601
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:41,260
There is a second closed beta announced for Street Fighter 6.

1602
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:45,580
They've done some tweaking to some of the characters.

1603
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:51,580
Actually, they've done quite a bit of bug fixes on it, balance adjustments.

1604
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:57,580
And they also have put in the Avatar creation.

1605
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:03,900
You can't save or load recipes for them or remake them during the beta, but you can make

1606
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:04,400
them.

1607
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:09,660
There's different features like cross-platform play, different control types, commentary,

1608
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:18,060
all of that was there and commentary by characters in the game.

1609
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:27,420
I think like different people like Vicious Tasty Steve Aru, Kosuke Hidaiwa, and other

1610
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:27,920
people.

1611
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:32,640
Then there are different stages playable.

1612
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:40,560
Metro City, Genbu Temple, Carrier, Byron Taylor, Chun Hong Yuan, the macho ring in the training

1613
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:47,120
room, and different game center challenges, different battles, different modes, all kinds

1614
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:47,620
of stuff.

1615
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:53,280
So it looks like it's going to be just a big push over the last one.

1616
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,160
I had a lot of fun playing this at TwitchCon.

1617
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:01,200
So I'd like to get in on it.

1618
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:05,840
I don't know if I can do it, but it is open for Steam players as well.

1619
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,200
Xbox 5, Xbox Series, and Steam.

1620
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:10,800
You know what?

1621
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,400
Capcom specifically needs somebody to test this whole Boosteroid thing.

1622
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,400
So I think you should write him an email.

1623
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:18,020
Yeah.

1624
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:19,060
All right.

1625
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:24,080
Well, if I could, I've been having some issues getting some stuff to play on Boosteroid.

1626
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:24,800
Oh, no.

1627
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,020
All right.

1628
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:27,540
All right.

1629
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:31,360
Moving on to what is going on in PlayStation Plus.

1630
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:36,640
December's monthly games have been announced, and an OLR Fave is a part of it.

1631
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,120
Actually, a whole OLR Fave trilogy is a part of it.

1632
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,360
These titles available from December 6 to January 2, including Mass Effect Legendary

1633
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:45,840
Edition.

1634
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:46,400
That's right.

1635
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:51,440
If you want to play the original trilogy, but all the DLC included, the all-in-one,

1636
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:55,280
optimized for 4K, all the things, that is available now.

1637
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,400
So check that out.

1638
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:02,160
You can also check out on PlayStation 5 slash PlayStation 4 Divine Knockouts Founders Edition

1639
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:04,720
that is launching, they say, directly into PlayStation Plus.

1640
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,760
You know, Rocket League got its start that way.

1641
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,680
So sometimes some big games come out of that.

1642
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:14,400
And then Biomutant, part melee shooting and mutant ability action.

1643
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:19,440
It's an open world RPG that is available on PS5 and PS4.

1644
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:22,560
So those are your free PS Plus games.

1645
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:23,200
Go grab them.

1646
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,040
If you're an Xbox person, I don't have the games.

1647
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,560
I think we talked about it last week, what's coming out for games with gold.

1648
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:35,520
But I can tell you what's coming to Game Pass, which is available, which I saw a long time

1649
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:40,560
listener, Dark Tetsuya, and I, we talked a little bit on Mastodon, and Dark Tetsuya talked

1650
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,640
about that they got an Xbox Series S.

1651
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,880
And so I think that's pretty cool.

1652
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:48,400
So they were like, I know him and Mish were like, what game should we get?

1653
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,800
And I was like, honestly, if you can afford it, just get Game Pass.

1654
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:56,160
So Dark Tetsuya, Mish, and everyone else with an Xbox.

1655
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,320
Here are some of the things coming out for Game Pass.

1656
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:01,600
Eastward is coming to Cloud, Console, and PC.

1657
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:06,640
The Walking Dead, The Final Season, and Total Reliable Delivery Service.

1658
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,080
Those just came out.

1659
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:11,840
On December the 6th, LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga.

1660
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,040
Hello Neighbor 2.

1661
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,880
That is actually a day one release.

1662
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:18,400
December 8th, Seized Chained Echoes and Metal Hellsinger.

1663
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:21,600

1665
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:26,960

01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:31,120
And yeah, those are all coming out real soon.

1667
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,360
So check that out if you're an Xbox Game Pass person.

1668
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:34,720
All right.

1669
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:38,240
Meanwhile, let's check out what's coming out to the retail shelves.

1670
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:42,080
I don't think this is a busy time of year for retail, but sometimes we're surprised.

1671
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,560
So let's travel around and check out some release dates.

1672
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,160
Loki, how about the US?

1673

1677
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,040
Xbox Series.

01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,440
Samurai Maiden on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

1679
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:26,560

1681
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:39,600
Adventure Academia, The Fractured Continent on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.

1682
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:47,120
Chuchu Charles on PC, and Dragon Quest Treasures on Nintendo Switch.

1683
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:47,600
That's it.

1684
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,120
All right.

1685
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,240
Traveling over to Japan.

1686
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,760
It's a pretty busy week still on the Nintendo Switch over in Japan.

1687
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:56,560
Witch on the Holy Knight is released in a regular and limited edition.

1688
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,600
Those are coming out in English, but it is a Japanese release.

1689
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:04,400
That's Sukai Tenki that Loki mentioned is also out in a regular and special edition

1690
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,840
on Japan this week.

1691
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:10,720
Idol, Janshi, Sushi, Pi, Saturn, Tribute is out in regular and limited edition as well.

1692
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,800
It Takes Two gets a release on the Switch in Japan.

1693
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,360
That was a big game at last year's Game Awards.

1694
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:20,880
So if you want to check that out in Japan, that is out on the Switch this week on December

1695
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:21,520
the 8th.

1696
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:26,560
Atlee, Ariza 1 and 2, a double pack is out on the Switch this week.

1697
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:30,720
The Rumble Fish 2 is out in English, but it is being released in Japan this week.

1698
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:34,800
Dragon Quest Treasures is also out a little later in the week on the 9th.

1699
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:41,360
But then Kanken Smart Taisaku and Aiken Smart Taisaku are both out on the 8th.

1700
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:47,920
On the PlayStation 5, I don't think we have a lot this week in Japan.

1701
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:52,000
They're just there is a Pulse 3D wireless headset that's coming out in Japan.

1702
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,400
I think that is a third party headset.

1703
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:58,000
And then other than that, really Far Cry 6 gets the Gold Edition release.

1704
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,480
I think that's just a repackaging of a prior release.

1705
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,840
But that is also out on the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan.

1706
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,480
Dark Sakura, what's going on in the UK?

1707
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:13,920
In that, what we have is on the 6th, Hello Neighbor 2 for PlayStation.

1708
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,280
Also on the 6th for PlayStation, Xbox Five Nights at Freddy's Collector's Edition.

1709
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:24,400
Cuckoo's Lost Pets on those and the Switch.

1710
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:28,560
Also for the three of them, we have Redout 2.

1711
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,440
We have, it looks like a big Cuphead collection.

1712
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:36,320
On the 8th, we have My Universe, My Baby Dragon for Switch.

1713
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:39,120
On the 9th, Dragon Quest Treasures, also for Switch.

1714
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:47,360
For Switch and PlayStation on the 9th, we have Adventure Academia, the Fractured Continent.

1715
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:52,240
I'm sorry, since you said My Baby Dragon, now all I hear in my head,

1716
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:55,040
now who that is, My Baby Dragon, now who that is.

1717
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:55,760
All right, forget it.

1718
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,560
I was thinking of like the Baby Monkey song.

1719
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,760
Baby Monkey, Baby Monkey.

1720
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:06,640
Baby Dragon, doo doo doo doo doo, Baby Dragon.

1721
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:07,680
No, I don't know.

1722
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:09,280
I don't know the song.

1723
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:15,840
Can you believe I have made it this long with not really hearing the whole song?

1724
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,640
Really?

1725
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:19,280
That's, do you think you'll win Whamageddon as well?

1726
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:24,800
No, I lost Whamageddon already and thanks to Nick, I lost the Mariah apocalypse.

1727
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,920
I don't mind the Wham song.

1728
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:33,760
I like the Wham song and I like the Paul McCartney one, even though it's really kind of weird.

1729
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:39,200
But I loathe the Mariah Carey song.

1730
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:41,680
Oh, I don't know.

1731
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:44,000
Your voice actually kind of annoys me.

1732
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,400
I don't know if I'm technically winning that or not because I haven't heard either one yet.

1733
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:53,840
Well, technically I haven't heard both of them, but I did hear when I was picking up

1734
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,120
high the other day.

1735
01:47:55,120 --> 01:48:00,800
I heard a cover of the Mariah Carey song, which I didn't realize there was a cover of

1736
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,080
that, but I heard that.

1737
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:04,480
So I don't know if that counts or not.

1738
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:10,720
I made it through the Mariah apocalypse for four years until someone finally got me with

1739
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:11,220
it.

1740
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,160
And that was actually last year and it was dro.

1741
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:18,640
Honestly, look, they, they ought to add Kate Bush to the list and I love Kate Bush, but

1742
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:22,560
man, ever since that four seasons Stranger Things came out, you cannot do a trip to the

1743
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:27,440
mall and not here running up that Hill anymore.

1744
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:29,120
I guess.

1745
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:30,480
I guess I'm the weird one.

1746
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:30,800
All right.

1747
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,120
I still think malls are fun, even if they're empty.

1748
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:34,180
All right.

1749
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:38,160
Honestly, I need to go to a Sephora soon.

1750
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,800
Go check out round one at the Galleria too.

1751
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:41,760
It's a lot of fun.

1752
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,120
Well, I don't want to go by myself.

1753
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:43,840
I'll come.

1754
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:44,400
Just tell me one.

1755
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:44,880
Okay.

1756
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:45,380
All right.

1757
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:50,240
Sj 100 Matt with a very good point in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1758
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:54,160
Loki talks about pie, but he doesn't say what pie he got.

1759
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:58,720
I didn't get pie for me because I don't like pie.

1760
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,120
I got a pumpkin pie for my wife.

1761
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:04,000
Oh, that's like several weeks ago.

1762
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,120
You, you bought the pie and you didn't even eat the pie.

1763
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:07,760
That's love.

1764
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:08,800
That's love.

1765
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,040
All right.

1766
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:09,920
I don't like pie.

1767
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,840
So it's easy thing for me to do.

1768
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,000
That's so say this in Alabama.

1769
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,760
I did have some good sweet potato pie.

1770
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:22,080
Pumpkin pie is one of those things that like, you know, ever since my diagnosis, it's like

1771
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:25,200
the one thing I allow myself as a special treat like once a year.

1772
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,840
So it's a big ever had sweet potato pie, Rob.

1773
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:28,640
Oh, I have.

1774
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:29,280
Yeah, of course I have.

1775
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:33,920
I've had sweet potato sweet potato is, is far superior to the pumpkin.

1776
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,680
Oh, well on that you're wrong, but that's okay.

1777
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:37,280
Everybody has their own opinion.

1778
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:41,920
I am absolutely 1000% correct.

1779
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:42,400
Correct.

1780
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:43,600
All right.

1781
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,840
Look one thing we can agree on.

1782
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:46,880
Did you do the UK dates?

1783
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,680
You did the UK date.

1784
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:47,920
Sorry.

1785
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:48,080
Yes.

1786
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,520
Cause I was making fun of baby dragon.

1787
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:49,760
All right.

1788
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,960
One thing we can agree on is that Yuzo Koshiro is awesome.

1789
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:58,960
And so Loki, what is our next story involving Yuzo Koshiro?

1790
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:08,080
Yuzo Koshiro is developing or at least working on a brand new mega drive and Genesis game.

1791
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:10,560
It looks to be a side scroller shmup.

1792
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,800
And along the lines of like a Gradius or something like that.

1793
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,400
It's awesome.

1794
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:21,200
There's not much that we know about it yet, but there's different ideas that he's been

1795
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:25,520
floating around basically saying that maybe they'll sell physical cards for it.

1796
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:31,200
It's like a whole Twitter thread about it, but yeah, I mean, it sounds cool.

1797
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:32,560
Sounds like he's excited about it.

1798
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,840
I'm excited to hear about whatever this is.

1799
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:40,080
Um, you're, you're, you're probably let's, let's be real.

1800
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:43,760
Yuzo Koshiro is probably making one of these so we can get bought for inclusion on the

1801
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:47,760
Genesis mega drive three mini when it comes out inevitably.

1802
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:49,920
Cause it sounds like the type of thing.

1803
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:50,720
I hope it's in there.

1804
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:52,240
Yeah, that'd be good.

1805
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:54,480
S2100.

1806
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:58,400
Matt on a, on the pie topic asks, have you had keto pumpkin pies, Rob?

1807
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:59,600
Curious if those are actually good.

1808
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:00,800
I have not made one.

1809
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,720
Are they good?

1810
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:03,280
I don't.

1811
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,960
A lot of mine was really delicious.

1812
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,520
A lot of the sugar free or whatever they do to it.

1813
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,200
Substitutes can be kind of meh.

1814
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:09,680
I don't know.

1815
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:13,760
Sometimes, sometimes even with keto though, they mix a little sugar with the sweetener

1816
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:16,320
stuff and it goes along with mine was all Splenda.

1817
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:16,820
Okay.

1818
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:23,920
And my crust was, um, crushed walnuts and, and butter.

1819
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:25,600
Okay.

1820
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:31,120
So it stuck to the thing and you got the, the texture, but it was, it was really, really good.

1821
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:31,920
That makes sense.

1822
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:34,320
Flipping out the crust like that probably goes a long way.

1823
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,840
So, but you know what?

1824
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,440
I can have the real thing in moderation.

1825
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,040
I'm still doing very well with all that.

1826
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:43,360
So, you know, it is, you know, I, I, if you don't allow yourself a little cheat here and

1827
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,880
there, you'll fall off the wagon hard.

1828
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:48,400
So a little cheat here and there is how I avoid falling off the wagon hard.

1829
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:49,520
All right.

1830
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:51,280
Moving on.

1831
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:52,960
I think we're to dark Sakura.

1832
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:54,480
Ooh, this, I love this story though.

1833
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:03,120
Well, I have to say I actually got myself caught up in a little bit of, uh, uh, a rabbit hole.

1834
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:07,280
So I'm going to get right back to that because I was looking up, um, board games.

1835
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:13,920
Um, which by the way, I've solidified my idea and I have just about everything except for

1836
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,280
one month already lined up.

1837
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:25,440
Anyway, so our Google doodle, uh, very recently honored the man, the legend, Jerry Lawson.

1838
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:35,120
And Jerry Lawson, you know, for people I have to remind was, are basically the person that

1839
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:41,040
gave us the interchangeable video game cartridge gaming system and created his own company

1840
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:44,000
called video soft in the early 1980s.

1841
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:50,320
And that company became one of the earliest, uh, black owned video game development companies,

1842
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:51,280
according to Google.

1843
01:52:52,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Um, and his children, um, Anderson and Karen said that he loved what he did and he did

1844
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:00,640
what he loved.

1845
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:07,760
And they thought that his achievements were quite remarkable given, you know, the way

1846
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,840
things were in, sorry for the noise.

1847
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:10,560
Sorry for the noise.

1848
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,560
I actually brought up the doodle to play a little bit.

1849
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:15,600
Oh, I didn't hear anything in early eighties.

1850
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:24,960
Um, but, uh, also, um, he did die in 2011, but that same year he was recognized by the

1851
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,720
international game developers association as an industry trailblazer.

1852
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:34,720
And his achievements have also been memorialized at the world video game hall of fame in New

1853
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,040
York.

1854
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:40,800
Uh, his children say that they wanted to thank Google for working with them to share, uh,

1855
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:46,080
his story in a doodle, which is a game by the way, and said, may his story continue

1856
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:50,560
to inspire numerous young people around the globe to achieve something remarkable.

1857
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,160
It was a great tribute.

1858
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:56,880
I loved it.

1859
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:57,440
Yeah.

1860
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:58,640
So it's nice.

1861
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:04,880
And remember next time you, you know, dust off the, the nest or even put in, you know,

1862
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:10,160
of a game desk, all that is because of this man.

1863
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:12,320
Well said.

1864
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:16,960
I'm glad, I'm glad history is remembering him a lot better than it used to.

1865
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,880
So cool at Google to do that.

1866
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:23,280
All right, moving on a few more stories for you, and then we'll get to our listener round

1867
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:26,560
table where we invite your calls over at twitch.tv.

1868
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:27,040

Well, you can also, uh, chat along with us at twitch.tv slash vog network, but if you

1871
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:37,280
That's VOG network.com slash discord.

1872
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:41,680
And you want to join our green room and the green room is how we will bring you on the

1873
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:43,120
air to chat with us.

1874
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:47,440
So, uh, we will get to that in a moment for now though, we have a couple more stories

1875
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:49,200
for you starting with Loki.

1876
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:50,320
Yeah.

1877
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:56,480
So apparently it's been revealed that from software engages in some level of crunch,

1878
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:02,880
according to some, uh, anonymous sources from, uh, different employees within the company.

1879
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:06,400
And this is through a game industry biz.

1880
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:09,840
They kind of interviewed some of these about different things that they encounter while

1881
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:10,480
working there.

1882
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:16,240
Um, one said, you know, during critical periods of game releases, I often had to work early

1883
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:18,480
mornings and overtime for two to three months.

1884
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:25,840
Um, another one said if it's, if it's not as if crunch happens on a daily basis,

1885
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:36,800
um, it's not excessive over time, but it's, it's so called, uh, for during the, um, I

1886
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:40,320
guess, uh, during some of the parts of the release.

1887
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:47,200
So, um, I, they were also talking about their salary as well.

1888
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:53,840
Um, that, uh, basically it's generally included in the salary, uh, regarding the compensation

1889
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:58,480
they get for crunch, but that the compensation was not necessarily adequate for some.

1890
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:04,720
And, um, didn't appear that from software didn't appear dissatisfied with their salaries

1891
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:05,200
either.

1892
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:05,440
Okay.

1893
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:06,800
We'll give them more money.

1894
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:15,600
I mean, um, but yeah, so, uh, that they're still struggling to get things right.

1895
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,560
But if you get over the bump, it's very satisfying.

1896
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:22,240
Just like defeat of Boston, dark souls said one employee.

1897
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:27,040
So, I mean, I understand it crutch sucks.

1898
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:33,680
Um, I know that a lot of companies still do that, but I mean, as long as they're not doing

1899
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:39,040
it in a whole ton, I still like the idea that they are doing it at all, you know, pace your

1900
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:44,880
games a little bit better, but at least it's not all the time, at least they're honest

1901
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:45,520
about it too.

1902
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:49,520
I mean, it doesn't excuse it, but at least the employees are honest about it.

1903
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:56,160
I mean, because, you know, uh, and they have to be anonymous about it, but yeah, the truth

1904
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:57,120
always comes out eventually.

1905
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:57,360
Right.

1906
01:56:58,080 --> 01:56:58,720
Exactly.

1907
01:56:58,720 --> 01:56:59,040
Yeah.

1908
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:00,720
All right.

1909
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:04,240
This last story tonight, this actually came from discord.

1910
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:08,560
So SSJ 100, Matt actually submitted this on discord and it was too good to not have as

1911
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,080
a final story for tonight.

1912
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:14,880
And it is about a brand new console that's coming out, but it's, um, not exactly.

1913
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,440
Why would we put a console in the last spot?

1914
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,960
It's not a console for humans.

1915
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:23,760
It's the Joypah, which is a console that is for dogs.

1916
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:29,760
And yes, it is a console that is designed for dogs to play games designed to provide

1917
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:32,400
physical and mental stimulation for dogs.

1918
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:37,680
It was initially conceived as a means of alleviating, alleviating boredom and separation

1919
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:40,480
anxiety for a puppy when it's home alone.

1920
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:45,040
But Joypah says the console has a potential to offer cognitive benefits for dogs could

1921
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:49,440
also help onset the, uh, or excuse me, help delay the onset of canine dementia.

1922
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,640
A lot of the same benefits they talk about in humans as well, which is interesting.

1923
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:54,080
Why is it going to be dogs?

1924
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:56,000
Uh, yeah, I know.

1925
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,320
Right.

1926
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:59,920
I'm, I'm hoping for the Meowpah or something to come after, but we'll see.

1927
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:05,680
Anyway, a dog would use their, a dog will use their nose to play on the console's touch

1928
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:10,800
screen and will be rewarded for correct choices via a treat dispenser.

1929
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:13,600
As Joe and her mat is saying, it can be adapted for cats.

1930
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,560
Well, that'd be cute.

1931
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:16,800
Uh, Joypah games, including whack-a-mole challenge.

1932
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:17,760
I know cats won't care.

1933
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:22,960
Although if you, if you put like an iPad down, cause I remember there was an iPad cat thing

1934
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,720
and a cat just basically scratches at the screen.

1935
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:27,440
That's, that's basically all that like meow mix or something did that.

1936
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:28,240
I don't know.

1937
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:32,400
Anyway, we don't know when this is coming out, uh, but you will be able to put, you

1938
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:37,920
can get one now if you put down a re uh, fully refundable deposit of $6.

1939
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,120
And that means you get a 5% discount on the final purchase price.

1940
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:42,960
How nice, how nice is that?

1941
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:46,960
And by the way, speaking of how nice I actually have just for the folks that are watching

1942
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:50,880
live, I have a little video of, uh, this in action.

1943
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,800
And for those, uh, that, um, are listening on the podcast feed, you see a good little

1944
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:55,680
dog there.

1945
01:58:55,680 --> 01:59:00,880
Who's, uh, looking at some moles on the screen and actually tapping the moles with his nose.

1946
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:05,520
And you see the owner is trying to like show the dog what to do, but the dog's like, I

1947
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,240
just want a treat.

1948
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:07,920
I just want a treat.

1949
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:12,720
And so the dog taps the little whack-a-mole thing and eventually gets a treat.

1950
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:16,880
I don't think that dog really wanted a treat, but, um, treats, treats are available.

1951
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,160
That is a very pretty dog.

1952
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:19,920
My goodness, my goodness.

1953
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,200
Anyway, there you go.

1954
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:22,160
That's the joy paw.

1955
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:26,800
It looks like it would be cute for dogs.

1956
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:32,320
I just hope they don't make the games too violent or with too much sexual content, you

1957
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:35,280
know, like that's, that's a real problem in the industry.

1958
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,680
And I just don't think we need to be subjecting the dogs to that.

1959
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:42,000
I, I really hope that they, you know, consider some of that with, uh, the game making.

1960
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:47,200
Um, uh, I can't see it comes up with some other names for this.

1961
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:50,880
Paw station, Wolf Tendo, Skinner Barks.

1962
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,440
I think that's supposed to be like X-Box because there's an X in that.

1963
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:57,520
Anyway, uh, dark tissue says rated E for every dog or cat.

1964
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:03,040
Uh, Zen monkey says people are going to love it until their dogs start jumping and knocking

1965
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,000
over the TV.

1966
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:08,720
Oh, the truth of that comment.

1967
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:10,880
The truth that be very careful with your setup.

1968
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:11,520
That's for sure.

1969
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:12,640
All right.

1970
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:17,600
Let's get to the listener round table where we invite you to participate with our show.

1971
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:22,000
Uh, you can send us an email every week and participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

1972
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,440
I don't think we got anything this week.

1973
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,920
Sadly, did we?

1974
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:26,560
No, I see that.

1975
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,880
I see the, the, the reverse notters.

1976
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:32,880
So, uh, we did not get any emails this week, but participate at orange on radio.com.

1977
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:34,240
If you want to send it for a future week.

1978
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:38,800
However, we also take calls here on this program via our discord server.

1979
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:41,120
And if you want to call into the show, you can go over to the green room.

1980
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:43,040
We actually have somebody on the line.

1981
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:45,600
So let's bring them in and have a chat.

1982
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:46,640
Hello.

1983
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:48,000
You're on orange launch radio.

1984
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:48,480
Who's this?

1985
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:52,080
Hi there.

1986
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:54,160
I don't know if you can hear me, but you're on orange launch radio.

1987
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:54,560
Who's this?

1988
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:56,160
Oh, can you guys hear me?

1989
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:56,880
Yes, we can.

1990
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:57,360
Hi there.

1991
02:00:58,400 --> 02:00:59,600
Hey, I'm AJ twist.

1992
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:01,120
Hey, I recognize the name.

1993
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:01,680
How are you?

1994
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:04,000
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.

1995
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,560
I haven't called in a long time, but I've been listening to you guys for forever for

1996
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:09,280
years now.

1997
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:09,680
Thank you.

1998
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:10,640
I appreciate that.

1999
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:12,960
I'm a podcast listener.

2000
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,800
Well, I'm so glad you could join us live tonight.

2001
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:20,400
I wanted to talk about the Smash world tour.

2002
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,600
Oh, please do.

2003
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:23,760
Because can you make any sense of this?

2004
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:28,160
Because this is worse than an episode of Jerry Springer, to be quite honest, with all the

2005
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:29,600
he said, she said.

2006
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:30,960
What's going on?

2007
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:32,880
Yeah.

2008
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:35,520
Well, just give you a little bit of background myself real quick, too.

2009
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:39,280
I've been playing Smash for years, probably a little longer than I've been listening to

2010
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:39,680
you guys.

2011
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:41,920
And I got a tournament.

2012
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:47,840
I've gone to evil over 10 times by now over since like 2004.

2013
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:50,880
So I've been following the scene for a long time.

2014
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:56,800
And the Smash community itself, just fighting games in general, is all grassroots.

2015
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:02,160
So it's kind of scary to hold tournaments sometimes with the fear of the companies shutting

2016
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:07,120
us down, which is definitely happened with Smash Brothers, probably more than what we

2017
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:09,360
know from what I've heard in the past.

2018
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:13,680
And then what was going on recently with the whole Smash world tour?

2019
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:16,400
They're actually, I think they were hosted by Panda Global.

2020
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:20,080
So Panda Global and Nintendo teamed up to do the Smash world tour.

2021
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:26,320
And then what was going on behind the scenes, the CEO of Panda Global, I think his name

2022
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:28,640
was like Alan Allen something, I think is what his name was.

2023
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:34,240
Supposedly, he was going around to other tournament organizers and telling them that they should

2024
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:39,120
sign up under Panda to do their tournaments, because if they don't, Nintendo is going to

2025
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:41,040
come through and shut them down.

2026
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:46,800
So he was talking to all these organizers, scaring them into signing up under his whole

2027
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:47,300
thing.

2028
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:51,200
And I think Nintendo heard about that and got involved.

2029
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:58,880
But on top of that, Nintendo is just, I don't know, they don't love their fans or something.

2030
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:05,600
Every time there's an event and they say they're okay with it, they end up turning around

2031
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,680
sometimes and being like, no, we're not okay with this.

2032
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:15,440
Something else like referring back to EVO 2013, where EVO almost had to take down Smash

2033
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,040
Brothers because of Nintendo.

2034
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:22,640
What happened back then supposedly too was, you know, Nintendo got word that Smash was

2035
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:23,440
happening at EVO.

2036
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,280
They're like, no, no, no, we need to stop this.

2037
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:28,960
And then within hours, I think they're like, you know, backed off like, no, never mind,

2038
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:29,440
you're all good.

2039
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:30,240
Go ahead and stream it.

2040
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:35,920
But supposedly what happened was it was the marketing department that was the one that

2041
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:41,360
wanted to shut down Smash Brothers that year, because that year was the same year that they

2042
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:45,920
were to announce Smash, I don't know, Smash 4 or whatever game was coming out that year.

2043
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:51,360
And so then he wants people to go look at the old game when there's a new game coming

2044
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:51,860
out.

2045
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,080
So there's that whole thing too.

2046
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:56,000
So I feel like Nintendo, go ahead.

2047
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,160
Well, no, I was just saying, it's interesting to me because I get the sense that like Nintendo

2048
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:03,680
seems to have like a working in silos type of problem.

2049
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:06,560
And I don't know if that's between the different departments, kind of like you illustrate there

2050
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:09,840
with the marketing department wants to do one thing, but the PR department wants to do

2051
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:10,560
another.

2052
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,000
Japan wants to do one thing.

2053
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,360
The US wants to do another.

2054
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:18,240
Like Nintendo has a serious communication problem within themselves that I think is

2055
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:19,760
really showing in this story.

2056
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:21,200
Exactly.

2057
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:22,400
That's what I was thinking too.

2058
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:25,760
It's like they're an octopus and one hand isn't talking to the other hand, it's not

2059
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:27,440
talking to the other hand, that's like the other hand.

2060
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:29,840
So they're all over the place sometimes, I think is what it is too.

2061
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:34,080
I think what ended up happening with that whole marketing department thing, almost shutting

2062
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:40,560
people down that year, was that it was supposedly a rumor that the wife of one of the head CEOs

2063
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,800
over there, you know, was like following this.

2064
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:44,720
And she's like, no, wait, you guys stop it.

2065
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:45,840
You know, this is a good thing.

2066
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,280
And then, you know, they turned it around.

2067
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:50,560
But yeah, but that's a whole crazy thing.

2068
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:54,960
And that's kind of like, you know, my, my, you know, news or what I can give you about

2069
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:57,360
this whole Smash World Tour thing, what's going on.

2070
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:01,280
And now the whole Smash community is kind of scared now because Nintendo is talking

2071
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:06,480
about licenses and, but they're like, but you guys could do your tournaments, but like,

2072
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:09,680
but you might want a license because if you don't have one, we're going to shut you down.

2073
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:13,840
But at the same time, the World Tour, Panda Global had a license and they still shut it

2074
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:14,080
down.

2075
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:15,280
So I was like, are we safe?

2076
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:16,080
Are we not safe?

2077
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:17,680
Like, you know, what should we do?

2078
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:21,840
Because, yeah, because they're, they're not able to, Nintendo's not able to communicate

2079
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,440
with itself, which is ridiculous.

2080
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:28,960
It's just, it's, it's, Nintendo needs to have probably some type of written sort of policy

2081
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:32,800
with this, or at least I imagine they probably do, but they're not enforcing it consistently.

2082
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:37,280
It's just, or I also, I'm also reminding you, Loki, you got into this last week when this

2083
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:42,000
whole thing kind of first came up is that you were talking about, it's reminiscent of

2084
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,840
Nintendo's YouTube policy.

2085
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:46,960
Remember when they were like, if you want to, if you want to show a Nintendo game on

2086
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:50,640
YouTube, you got to be through our creator program and we get 30%.

2087
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:57,200
And it's like, you can't, you can't, Nintendo does not have the muscle to police that.

2088
02:05:57,200 --> 02:06:00,080
They just, it's a good thing that their games are good.

2089
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:04,640
Cause if they weren't, I mean, their community building is not great.

2090
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:09,120
I know they really let rest on how strong some of those games resonate with people.

2091
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:13,680
Well, let me ask you this, AG twist, because you are, you said you've been with the smash

2092
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:15,520
scene a long time.

2093
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:17,360
How does this make you feel as a fan?

2094
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:19,680
Like, are you still an avid fan of smash?

2095
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:23,840
Cause you just kind of look past all this or are you like, dang, maybe, maybe it's time

2096
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:25,200
to pick up Tekken.

2097
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:28,000
Like, I don't know, like what, where do you come from as a fan?

2098
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:32,560
Actually, I play more Tekken than smash, honestly, as of lately.

2099
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:38,080
How much of that is because of this bullshit?

2100
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:40,480
That's a good question.

2101
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:46,880
I don't know, those are my friends, honestly, but I would like to participate in more smash

2102
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:47,680
tournaments and stuff.

2103
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:51,680
Just being older now, I don't really have the time, but I still try to support when

2104
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:56,720
I can maybe join a tournament when I'm able to definitely watch some of the Twitch streams

2105
02:06:56,720 --> 02:06:57,920
and stuff like that when they happen.

2106
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:03,840
But mostly I like going to locals that are not usually streamed.

2107
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:08,000
So if we can still do our locals and Nintendo's not going to shut those, you know, you know,

2108
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,480
comic book stores or small arcades, you know, those are not going to get shut down, then

2109
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,880
I will still try to play Smash when I can.

2110
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:20,160
But as far as bigger tournaments, I mean, I go to Evil often and I would definitely

2111
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:24,720
join Smash Brothers when it's there at Evil, but it hasn't been in a while.

2112
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:29,440
So if it's not at Evil because, you know, because Nintendo, then I guess I'm not going

2113
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:31,520
to really play any Smash at any tournaments.

2114
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:33,760
Big tournaments.

2115
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:34,400
Good point.

2116
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:39,120
I hope Nintendo hears, but maybe one person in Nintendo is hearing it, but can't seem

2117
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:41,040
to communicate it to anybody else within Nintendo.

2118
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:45,760
They also don't like that they play modded Smash as well is one of the problems.

2119
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,360
Yeah, that's the other thing, too.

2120
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:54,320
Yeah, they try to do a tournament using Slippy, which gives the GameCube Smash Melee online

2121
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:55,360
connectivity.

2122
02:07:55,360 --> 02:08:00,240
And they shut that down for one big tournament like last year, two years ago, because it

2123
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:01,280
was during COVID.

2124
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,440
And of course, you have to do the tournament that way.

2125
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:05,200
Oh, that whole thing was ridiculous.

2126
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:06,480
Yeah, that's stupid.

2127
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:14,080
Yeah, I just Nintendo needs to read the room or they need to start hiring some people who

2128
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,360
are reading the room.

2129
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:20,000
Like, maybe what Nintendo could do is hire some Smash tournament organizers to really

2130
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,720
represent them in these discussions, because it's just a mess.

2131
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:26,160
The whole communication thing is a mess.

2132
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:28,000
And I feel like they just don't understand.

2133
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,120
A lot of it's probably just old school ways of thinking.

2134
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:34,720
The old guard has been running Nintendo for a very long time.

2135
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:38,880
And I think maybe some of that probably needs to be shaken up a little bit, or it's going

2136
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:41,920
to come back to bite them because they're going to look to those fans to really push

2137
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:43,120
the next Smash game.

2138
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:44,400
And I'm sure you know what?

2139
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:50,000
I'm sure the next Smash game will sell oodles and oodles of copies, whether Sakurai is involved

2140
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:50,560
or not.

2141
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:54,080
Just having the name, it's going to sell millions from the go.

2142
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:58,160
It's just the way it is with those franchises, but it's just kind of one of those.

2143
02:08:58,160 --> 02:08:59,920
It could do so much more.

2144
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:06,640
It could be featured in comic book stores and makeshift arcades throughout the nation.

2145
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:12,800
If Nintendo would just let the community be a community instead of trying to get 10% of

2146
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:13,920
it, it's just silly.

2147
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:21,680
I'll be very curious to see what happens with the panda resignations, though.

2148
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:25,520
That adds a whole other interesting element to this to be continued.

2149
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:28,000
Yeah, I'm kind of interested in that, too.

2150
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:32,960
Yeah, I want to share one more other thing, not related, though.

2151
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:36,160
But kind of to give you a little more background, I guess what I do.

2152
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:39,840
What I'm about to do right now, I'm actually outside my friend's house.

2153
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,840
We're about to play some fighting games.

2154
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:49,120
Every weekend we get together, play fighting games, and we do a small tournament amongst

2155
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:50,080
ourselves.

2156
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:55,120
We have Mjolnir, we have Thor's hammer, and that's our trophy for the night.

2157
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:58,800
So out there getting some practice rounds, we do a bracket tournament.

2158
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:01,040
Sometimes there's like four of us.

2159
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:02,320
Sometimes there's like eight of us.

2160
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:06,800
And then whoever wins whatever game we decide that night, they take home the hammer for

2161
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:07,120
the week.

2162
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:08,320
I love that.

2163
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:09,360
That's awesome.

2164
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:10,000
That's awesome.

2165
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,680
It's like, you know, I bet there's a lot of like board game fans that do something similar

2166
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:17,840
to that have a prize that they pass amongst themselves for whoever, you know, is the winner

2167
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:18,640
or so forth.

2168
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:23,360
And that's when the fighting tournaments, fighting game tournaments are or any game

2169
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:28,560
tournament, really, DDR, you name it, is the most awesome is when, you know, it's so

2170
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:29,600
community driven like that.

2171
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:33,840
And I think that's why it sucks to hear about what Nintendo is doing here, because it's

2172
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:36,240
like, it makes people scared to do this.

2173
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:40,240
Like, is Nintendo going to cease and desist your circle of friends if they find out about

2174
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:40,720
it?

2175
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:44,400
It's at what point, but at what point do you draw the line?

2176
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:45,920
True.

2177
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:46,400
Yeah.

2178
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,320
And sometimes we do try to stream it too.

2179
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:51,520
So like, if we do Smash Brothers one night, I might be in fear.

2180
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:53,520
Like, I don't know, guys, maybe we shouldn't do this.

2181
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:57,040
If Nintendo can't even communicate where the line is.

2182
02:10:58,080 --> 02:10:58,580
True.

2183
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:02,240
But anyway, I hope you don't let that stop you.

2184
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:03,120
You know what?

2185
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:04,400
We've all got your back.

2186
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:05,680
We'll go, we'll go fight.

2187
02:11:05,680 --> 02:11:08,800
We'll go, we'll go, we'll go fight people if we have to on your behalf.

2188
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:11,600
Uh, and you have Thor, you have Thor's hammer.

2189
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:13,280
You can fend people off.

2190
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:18,400
You know, when you start, you know, issuing out some thunder and lightning, though, I'd

2191
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,240
be really interested in that.

2192
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:23,360
Tiger Claw in chat says Thor's hammer is the prize.

2193
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:24,560
I hope the winner is worthy.

2194
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:26,240
Well, obviously they proved themselves worthy.

2195
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:26,880
Tiger Claw.

2196
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:27,680
That's the point.

2197
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:27,920
Yeah.

2198
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:31,280
SG100Matt says that is awesome.

2199
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:34,080
Really brings me back to my high school days of playing games.

2200
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:37,760
Well, I'm going to guess if AJ Twist has been listening since the beginning of OLR.

2201
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:42,800
AJ Twist is no longer in high school, but, uh, I think that's awesome that you can still

2202
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:44,240
kind of live, live that.

2203
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:46,560
So yeah, it is something we like to do.

2204
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,760
That's all the news we can.

2205
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:49,840
And I don't have the hammer right now myself.

2206
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:55,040
You know, I might need to go win it so I can, uh, lumb out some lightning.

2207
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:55,920
What's on deck tonight?

2208
02:11:57,120 --> 02:11:57,760
Don't know yet.

2209
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:59,040
I'm about to walk in and find out.

2210
02:11:59,040 --> 02:11:59,920
I'm hoping Tekken.

2211
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,920
I would prefer Soul Calibur or maybe Smash Brothers.

2212
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:06,560
Maybe it could be a ironic and go play some Smash tonight.

2213
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,040
I love some irony.

2214
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:10,720
So I'm rooting for Smash Brothers tonight.

2215
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:12,560
All right.

2216
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:13,440
Good luck to my friend.

2217
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:14,080
Win that hammer.

2218
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:16,080
All right.

2219
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:16,400
Thank you.

2220
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:16,880
Have a good night.

2221
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:17,520
Thanks for the call.

2222
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:17,920
You too.

2223
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:18,400
Bye-bye.

2224
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:20,480
That's great.

2225
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:20,800
Thank you.

2226
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:22,160
AJ twist for the call.

2227
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:23,360
Really appreciate that.

2228
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:24,400
I was, that was great.

2229
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:27,680
If you want to call us, uh, in a future week, uh, join our discord

2230
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:29,440
server, vog network.com.

2231
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:32,000
That's vognetwork.com slash discord.

2232
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:35,360
Great to hear from somebody we haven't heard from in a long time as well.

2233
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:37,440
Um, and we, we love the regulars.

2234
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:38,400
Please do not get me wrong.

2235
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:42,320
We love them, but we also love to hear from friends that have been lurking in

2236
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:45,760
the podcast, uh, shadows, so to speak for some time.

2237
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:46,320
It's awesome.

2238
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:49,520
I just wanted to check in real quick before we wrap it all up and see if we

2239
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:51,120
have any last minute stories.

2240
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:53,280
Loki, I know it's not really the time of your forum.

2241
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:54,160
I've been looking.

2242
02:12:54,160 --> 02:12:54,720
All right.

2243
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:55,360
I thought I would.

2244
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:56,000
Thought I wouldn't.

2245
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:56,480
All right.

2246
02:12:56,480 --> 02:12:59,200
Well then I guess we'll go ahead and we'll wrap it up for tonight.

2247
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:02,320
So thank you all so much for listening to orange launch radio tonight and

2248
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:06,480
participating with our show, uh, whether it was your first episode or your 939th

2249
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:08,560
episode, we appreciate you being here all the same.

2250
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:09,920
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2251
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:12,960
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2252
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:14,880
But we need more voices to put out on air.

2253
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,600
Hello.

2254
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:19,520
So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or wherever it is,

2255
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:22,080
you found this podcast, those going off a long way.

2256
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:23,840
And we super appreciate those.

2257
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:27,920
I did, by the way, this is the time of year where like the Spotify and

2258
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:30,160
podcasters get one of those.

2259
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:32,880
And so I got to see that there's all these different countries around the

2260
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,240
world that listen to the show.

2261
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:38,160
And did you know there's more people, there's more people listening to us in

2262
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:43,280
like, I want to say it was, it was what I think the Philippines was actually

2263
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:46,880
the number two most listened to country above Mexico and Canada.

2264
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,680
Was the Philippines.

2265
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:51,200
I want to say I have to go back and look, sorry, I had a mic mishap here.

2266
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:53,520
I have to go back and look to be sure, but I thought that was really cool.

2267
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:56,880
So hello to our, uh, folks that are listening out there that are helping

2268
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:58,800
to inflate the numbers out there.

2269
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:01,360
So I appreciate that.

2270
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:01,760
All right.

2271
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:04,640
Um, we've got a really good VPN.

2272
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:08,480
Maybe, maybe also the only bummer about that.

2273
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:11,920
And the reason why I didn't post it publicly on any of our social media

2274
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:17,280
channels, it appears to only assess the last 10 episodes because our

2275
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:20,160
podcast feed is only the last 10 episodes.

2276
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:24,080
So unfortunately, I guess Spotify doesn't hold the statistics for the

2277
02:14:24,080 --> 02:14:24,960
older stuff.

2278
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:28,480
So that is true anyway, for the last like three months or something like

2279
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:28,720
that.

2280
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:30,320
So I thought that was interesting.

2281
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:31,280
So, all right.

2282
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:31,920
Anyway.

2283
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:33,920
Um, that's it.

2284
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:36,320
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.

2285
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:39,680
Um, dark Sakura, I'm you're back on the dead bite.

2286
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:41,600
You're back on some dbd bullshit.

2287
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:44,880
I mean that in the nicest possible way tonight after the show.

2288
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,320
So I imagine you want to go set up.

2289
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:48,000
So do you have any final thoughts for us?

2290
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:51,920
Um, not really.

2291
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:52,960
People are stinky.

2292
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:56,880
And for some reason, my stream deck never wants to stay connected.

2293
02:14:57,440 --> 02:15:02,000
So, oh, well, everyone try not to suck.

2294
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:03,040
All right.

2295
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:03,760
I'll do my best.

2296
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:05,840
Good to have you back tonight later.

2297
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:06,080
All right.

2298
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:06,320
Bye.

2299
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:07,520
All right.

2300
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:09,120
Loki, how about you?

2301
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:10,240
What's your final thought for the night?

2302
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:15,120
Uh, hopefully look forward to a brand new video from me very soon.

2303
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:16,560
Yay.

2304
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:17,280
I'll be awesome.

2305
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:22,880
Uh, and my final thought is, um, I don't know.

2306
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:28,720
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go hook up with wow later tonight, I think, but I'm gonna go walk because

2307
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:32,960
it's important to get out and walk and do all that stuff too.

2308
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:36,880
And I haven't been able to like literally all weekend because it's been raining, but

2309
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:38,720
I think we finally have a break in the rain.

2310
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:44,240
So I need to go plant some flowers in Pikmin Bloom because I left it out of my gaming week,

2311
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:47,920
but I hit level 69 in Pikmin Bloom.

2312
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:48,880
Nice.

2313
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:51,360
All right.

2314
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,800
That's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.

2315
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:58,240
We'll be back in seven days on December the 11th to do it all again.

2316
02:15:58,240 --> 02:16:00,080
I hope you all have a wonderful week.

2317
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:01,120
Thanks.

2318
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:02,800
And we'll see you next time.

2319
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:03,200
Bye bye.

02:16:05,200 --> 02:16:07,680
