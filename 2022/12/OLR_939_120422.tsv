0	29000	Classic Final Fantasy games provided a fantasy. Magical, mystical universes, early industrial works at best. Those themes went largely unchanged into the reality TV show era, post-Survivor, Big Brother, etc. or at least were never emphasized until recently. Final Fantasy XVI is truly entering its teenage years, adopting mature themes of sex, drugs, and torture, and more appear to be in store for us.
29000	36000	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
39000	58000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, once again with episode number 939 of our show for tonight, December the fourth of 2022.
58000	66000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me once again, welcome back to the show please DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66000	67000	Hey.
67000	68000	Hi, welcome back.
68000	70000	Hi, thank you.
70000	73000	We missed you although our aim is always improving.
73000	74000	Always.
75000	89000	Always. I hope you had a good, I know you kind of had to go because you were visiting your mom who, you know, you were talking about on the show previously but I hope all things considered you had a great time just catching up with people and all that stuff.
89000	91000	I have news actually.
91000	92000	Oh?
92000	98000	Mom. Well, while I was in Alabama mom got moved from the ICU to a regular room.
98000	103000	And they took her catheter out. She was happy about that.
103000	117000	I would be too. I think we all would. Yeah, um, she isn't losing as much oxygen when she moves around and though she's still losing some she's trying to do too much on her own, but they think that she might be ready to be discharged in about a week.
117000	119000	Oh good.
119000	134000	But then she has to move in with my uncle and we don't know what's going to happen with her house and everything but I'm gonna say this right now, driving from Bay Monette to Mobile, and back in Alabama rain.
134000	137000	Dear people in California.
137000	141000	Never complain about rain again.
141000	145000	Because it's been raining here all weekend but this isn't rain.
145000	149000	This has been a light drizzle compared to the shit I drove in.
149000	153000	No, I get it. Everything's bigger in the south even the weather.
153000	163000	I will say I will say though, I don't know if it's the lighting if it's makeup or what but you look glowing tonight a little time off is is great for the soul, isn't it?
163000	167000	Well, um, I actually changed one of my lights to a warmer light.
167000	169000	Okay, maybe that's doing it too but-
169000	171000	And then I have a blue purple here.
171000	172000	Okay.
172000	174000	And I have a wider light here.
174000	176000	How many frickin lights do you have on you over there?
176000	178000	I have four.
178000	186000	I have two panel lights that are about yay big, and I have a ring light that changes color and right now I have it set to blue and purple.
186000	194000	I have a plain white, like my old ring light that's like this but I have it reflecting off of the metal of the desk you and I have the same desk.
194000	202000	I have my other panel light right there that's warm light and I, it turned out pretty nicely.
202000	208000	It does take good lighting and of course you know we are talking about visuals because we do tape live if you want to see us we do tape live.
208000	221000	Every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby black wolf show and we tape live, so that you all can have your live comments to which pod culture with our first
221000	233000	comment tonight, talking about dark soccer setup says there are four lights. Yes, there are indeed four lights confirmed. And by the way for those who aren't live there's always the VOD.
233000	249000	There is the VOD available to our subscribers over twitch.tv slash VOG network, but of course, free as a podcast, as it's been ever since when did we start, I mean the show started in 2002 when a podcast start 2004 I think is when the podcast started free
249000	278000	this has been since the beginning and that's that's not going to change. So yeah, also say hello to something that's been here from the very beginning and isn't going to change. Say hello to tech master Loki. Hello. Hi, Loki, how are you? I'm doing fine. What is you have a very retro game playing behind you tonight as we are broadcasting. It's not a retro game. It's not a retro game. It's a retro inspired game. Clearly, it's a game with that one right now that's a game within a game. But if I restart the video, it's a holiday game.
278000	307000	It's a holiday game, obviously, because it's a Frog Fraction holiday. What is it? No. I Oh, is it Die Hard? It's Die Hard the arcade. Oh, okay. I see what you did there. Gotcha. All right, good. Good. I'm sorry, I'm still going to to this day say that Gremlins is the better Christmas movie. It's, um, yeah, I guess that's a game within a game. I don't remember playing that game within a game.
307000	326920	Game within a game. But um, yeah, I played this at the arcade quite a bit. I think I think the Die Hard argument is tired. Yes, Die Hard is a holiday movie. Let's move on. My favorite Christmas movie is Batman Returns. That's my favorite Christmas movie. I'm sorry. I try to watch it every holiday. Don't you know Batman Returns was good. I was like, Don't be sorry. It's a great movie.
327920	339920	Um, well, and actually my favorite actual like Christmasy movie that I like is Elf. It's funny because I don't like Will Ferrell. And I don't really like comedies that much not like that. And I love this movie.
339920	355440	I guess I'm really cliche because I have memories of watching A Christmas Story, which I know is super cliche at this point. I think it's very symbolic of our generation. But my mom really loved that movie. And you know, so there's there's like, you know, a tie in with that. I wish I wish she could. Well, there was actually like a really shitty.
355440	361920	I know there was a really shitty sequel. Now there's this the sequel that please don't remember the other sequel.
361920	364640	Well, there's the there's the there's the hey,
364640	365840	retcon sequel, maybe
365840	378040	this no, it's the this is what we do in 2010 and 2020 is now we just reboot all the shit from the 80s and 90s with where are they 30 years from now. So that is the the Christmas the Christmas story story movie.
378640	390240	Just people will either want to watch it because they want to recapture the magic or they'll watch it out of morbid curiosity, so that they can actually legitimately complain about it because they did see it.
390760	392120	Some other folks. Oh, go ahead.
392680	405000	I was going to say I did want to make out to the theaters this week and or I wanted to go see Violent Night, which unfortunately, the showtimes just weren't jiving with my free time.
405480	411760	But that's another another Christmas movie in the same vein as Fat Man, which is just the best.
412040	416000	That is like it is like if you combine Die Hard with a Christmas movie.
416600	418880	Tiger Claw just brought that up in shadows to read that.
418880	422400	Yeah. I what about stuff like Krampus?
422440	424960	Is there not like a horror movie for the holidays?
427600	431360	The only Krampus I care about is playing a is it The Trapper?
432600	434600	Oh, yeah. Cute skin and DVD.
434600	438440	Yeah. And it's funny is my wife actually liked Fat Man.
438440	440520	Like she was like, I thought there was supposed to be a sequel.
440520	441880	They haven't made a sequel yet.
442280	443320	Oh, yeah.
443320	446640	SSG 100 Matt says there's a Grinch horror movie coming out this week.
446640	448200	That's right. Because it's the same guy that does.
448400	457440	It's the same guy that plays Art the Clown from the Terrifier movies, which I I knew about those movies before they were cool because they had the director and a star here.
457440	459800	Look, it's it's I can't watch it.
459800	461760	I can't watch evil clowns.
461800	466960	I sorry. Well, and those movies are violent with a capital B bolded underlined.
466960	472280	It's just it's not my thing, but I understand it is some people's thing and cool for you.
472280	473160	Like have fun.
473640	474160	Have fun.
474160	476360	Derail the topics again.
477240	480440	So let's talk about the biggest movie trailer of the week.
480480	482320	I was just gonna bring it up our minds.
482320	483160	We're on the same one.
483160	485960	Bear is seriously gonna be amazing.
485960	487400	Like I cannot wait.
487400	488720	Okay, maybe not that movie.
488760	489320	Maybe not.
489800	492840	No, the cocaine bear trailer legit looked amazing.
492840	493680	I did see that.
493680	494400	I did dark soccer.
494400	495080	Have you seen this?
496120	497080	You need to look this.
497200	504120	There's a movie and it's like based on a true story or whatever called cocaine bear, which makes me think of that meme with the bear.
504120	505520	That's like I fucking love cocaine.
505920	509360	But apparently there was a bear that ingested a bunch of cocaine.
509520	512720	But the thing is, they're taking a sharknado approach.
512720	516160	It seems where this movie knows exactly what it is.
516400	519280	And we love a self-aware shitty movie.
519480	522920	Like it's going to be fantastic.
522920	524400	I am there day one.
524400	525360	Okay, we're sure.
525800	526840	I thought when you.
527600	528280	Okay.
528280	537720	I thought when you brought up movie trailers from the week, because it isn't on our show roll, so I'll bring it up now and then we'll get into our kickoff topic.
538040	542160	But there was a new Mario Brothers movie tweet or tweet.
542160	545000	There was a new Mario Brothers movie trailer, probably in a tweet.
545000	546360	People are already tweeting about it.
546360	546840	I'm sure.
546840	547320	I'm sure.
548120	551840	And there was a whole direct Nintendo did about this.
551840	554040	I didn't see the direct, but I did see the second trailer.
554360	566040	And I have to say, you know why I have my reservations about who they got to play Mario and the fact that, like, this trailer just confirms he's just doing a second rate Charles Martinet.
566200	566760	He's not.
566960	567600	Here's the thing.
567600	568160	Here's the thing.
569280	574680	At least Captain Lou Albano and Charles Martinet were very different Marios.
574720	576200	There were different approaches to the characters.
576200	576800	They were different.
576960	582280	I'm sorry, but what I saw in that trailer was second rate Charles Martinet, but it is what it is.
582280	587080	I'm trying to move past that because literally everything else in the trailer I really enjoyed.
587400	598400	I thought the fact that they're incorporating like Mario Kart type of elements into it and almost like Smash Brothers, maybe, yes, the way it looks like the stages are kind of like incorporated into it.
598400	599880	Like, it looks really good.
599960	600240	Yeah.
600240	603120	Orange right in chat says Chris Pratt is not going to ruin the movie.
603160	603680	He's not.
603680	604960	Yeah, it's not.
604960	609880	And I'm sure I'm willing to see it be a twist for who, you know, he ruins things.
609880	610360	That's all.
610360	610720	Yeah.
610760	611160	Yeah.
611600	618960	And there was a, I was at Target last night and there were Parks and Recreation dolls and one of them was of Chris Pratt's characters.
618960	621600	I was like, ah, but I was like, but Parks and Rec is so good.
621600	623240	Like he's not taking that from me.
623240	627080	He's just not like that was back when, before he just was everywhere.
627280	628000	That's what it is.
628000	630880	Y'all like y'all it's, it's the oversaturation thing.
630880	632440	I really don't have a problem with him.
632440	634440	Like, I like the stuff he's in.
634440	636560	Like, I don't know, except Jurassic World.
636560	637360	That just is awful.
637360	639640	But the problems are with him as a person.
639680	640000	Yeah.
640040	640280	Yeah.
640320	645640	It's, it's, it's some of the ways he's treated his ex-wife and some of the other affiliations.
645640	649800	But anyway, I'm not, I'm not going to let, he's not going to ruin this movie for me because...
649800	652920	I file him under problematic faves for a lot of people.
652960	653440	Yes.
653560	655600	I don't care for him as a person.
655960	658760	I, he's...
659600	660440	Yeah.
660480	662360	You can't pick one evil over another.
662360	662720	Exactly.
662720	663080	Exactly.
663080	663960	So here's the thing.
664240	666440	Otherwise, the movie looks really good.
666440	669720	Like I don't want that to ruin what otherwise was a really good trailer otherwise.
669880	670720	And let me say this.
670720	688680	One thing I absolutely noticed about this trailer that I didn't hear a lot of people talking about is that if you want to talk about problematic fave, it seems that this movie took one of the most tired tropes that Mario is, that Mario is usually guilty of, which is the save the damsel in distress trope.
688840	693600	And it looks like it's flipping that on its head because Princess Peach appears to be the sidekick character.
693800	695840	And it looks like Luigi's the damsel in distress.
695880	697920	Now, granted, it could always be a misdirect.
698160	700240	It could always, you know, the trailer is only a trailer.
700360	704720	But certainly we saw Princess Peach doing a lot of different things.
704720	709440	And they're really rounding out her character, which I think is great.
709600	714440	Like I've always loved Princess Peach from Mario 2, to be honest, and her floating ability.
714440	717160	So I think they should all stand as equals.
717600	723920	The Mario 2 quintet, I almost said quintet, the Mario 2 quartet should stand as equals.
723920	725040	So I think I think it's cool.
726160	731680	I will point out that she took that role because of palette swap necessity.
732600	733280	However,
733560	735240	hey, whatever the reason.
736880	737200	It worked.
737200	740200	I, I, I like her as a character.
740200	742240	I played her 90% of the game.
743520	747280	You know, when for Super Mario USA.
748000	755800	And to be fair before it before everyone's because you know, I like like, look, I haven't used Twitter in weeks, but I already know I already can tell there's going to be people
755800	766120	that are on there that are like, these fucking movies going woke with this Princess Peach in the night and armor woke this woke bullshit these woke movies doing this woke shit.
767720	781480	Just so you know, if you were a real gamer, you would know that Luigi was already the damsel in distress in the Mario games in Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island, Luigi was the one needing saving.
781600	784880	So this isn't exactly new to the franchise.
784920	790800	So sit down, sit on it, shut up, delete your Twitter, make me a sandwich.
790960	797720	The only thing that is being saving in Super Mario World 2 was our eardrums of Mario crying the entire time.
799240	802000	Did you see the TV spots that they have also?
802040	803240	Oh, no, I didn't see those trailers.
803240	804800	No, different in different languages.
804800	806520	I have TV footage in there.
806520	810920	So well, nobody, but like it's on the internet as well.
811400	814560	They had like different they're from different regions, obviously.
814560	817560	And they had different stuff being shown.
817560	819200	It means all good stuff.
819200	821360	So it looks yeah, I've very exciting.
821360	825400	I've gone from whatever about the movie to like, okay, yeah, I do want to see this.
825400	828920	Like I want to take I want to take Dark Sakura and Loki.
829080	840600	I want to go on a throuple date, whoever else wants to go can come to but I want to go on a date and go get a big tub of popcorn and just watch this crap and be entertained by it because it's going to be a
840600	841800	bunch of nostalgia stuff.
841800	843040	I'm I'm really into it.
844040	847520	DJ Rama asked in chat says I swear if they make Daisy the damsel in distress.
847520	848920	I'm going post apocalyptic.
849040	852360	I don't think that you would already know Daisy's in the movie if that was the case.
852360	853760	So I don't think that's happening.
853960	857840	But who's to say that Daisy won't play some role in the sequel?
857840	863680	Like I'm actively thinking about where the hell does a sequel go now from this point?
863680	865920	Because I think that could be very interesting, to be honest.
865960	874320	So and this idea that maybe they are setting up a metaverse with or multiverse or whatever with Donkey Kong, and all this other stuff.
874320	875640	I it could be interesting.
875720	881320	So Tiger Klein chat says I think having peach having a more active role is great.
881440	883840	She has recently been playing in some of the games so makes sense.
883840	884840	She goes on the adventure.
884840	885200	Yes.
885360	890680	And I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I've seen enough of this stuff over the years.
890680	894480	I'm telling you, Charles Martinet is one of two things in this movie.
895120	900520	He's Wario, like at the very end, and some type of setup for the next movie where Wario is the bad.
900760	902200	I think that's less likely.
903120	906440	Number two, and I think this is absolutely what it's going to be.
906560	912240	He's going to be Mario and Luigi's father, which is a character that's never been introduced in the games or anything.
912480	922400	And absolutely, Mario and Luigi's I bet Charles Martinet is going to play a parent or grandparent, some type of family member of Mario and Luigi's that we've never met.
923400	925160	So we'll see.
925520	930320	Come back, clip it, and we'll come back to this in a few months when the movie's out.
932000	932480	Let's see.
933120	937480	Tiger class says the movie mentions about galaxies, so it's possible we might see Rosalina.
938040	941040	There's a leak of a toy that shows what appears to be Luma Lee.
941360	943600	Ooh, I can't see in our chat.
943640	945840	Welcome, welcome, says Jumpman.
946080	957760	That's a really clever way to how to incorporate like a father figure for Mario and Luigi is that it could trace back to the OG Mario or Jumpman from the Donkey Kong games.
957760	969800	It could tie into, you know, Donkey Kong being a brute now and all this stuff like I don't know, I didn't write the movie, but I could I could see where like the more classic Jumpman could be something that Charles Martinet is is actually playing.
969800	973040	So I think that's a clever little way they could do it.
973080	973760	So we'll see.
974320	974720	We'll see.
975080	975800	Anyway, all right.
975800	978080	That wasn't really on our list of things to talk about tonight.
978080	980880	But when we started talking about movies, had to talk about that a little bit.
981680	984880	Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks.
985360	989920	But speaking of Nintendo, not all the news is good on Nintendo front this week.
989920	992960	In fact, this is one this is I don't I don't know what else to say.
992960	994920	Loki, this is just a mess.
995120	995800	It's a mess.
995840	997840	It's confusing is what it is.
997840	1010880	It's basically there was this Smash World Tour that was going on, and they had announced that it was, without warning, being shut down by Nintendo, who told them they can no longer operate.
1011520	1019720	And of course, Smash World Tour is run by a third party group of fans who put together a bunch of these different tournaments.
1019720	1029400	And I think it was like almost at the yeah, the annual championship was coming up with massive cash prizes, and I think they even had like a charity element to it as well.
1031480	1044200	But now it's yeah, they're going to have a prize pool of was it $250,000 and they were even having planning on having a prize pool of $350,000 for 2023.
1044920	1052600	But without warning, they said we were received notice the night before Thanksgiving from Nintendo that we can no longer operate.
1053320	1057880	And we've so it there's a lot to it.
1057880	1073720	So the Smash World Tour organizers, basically saying, you know, we don't know where everything will land quite yet with the contract sponsor obligation.
1074440	1074840	Etc.
1074840	1079080	In short, we will be losing hundreds of thousands of dollars due to Nintendo's actions.
1079080	1084840	That being said, we are more we're taking steps to remedy many issues that have risen from the cancellation.
1086360	1088240	So there is going to be working with that.
1088240	1100200	But then, of course, there's also this drama that's going on with Panda, which is the Panda Cup, which is a separate entity whatsoever that runs another set of tournaments as well.
1101080	1110200	And there's allegations that they're responsible for Nintendo canceling it.
1110200	1125320	And because they're like animosity between the two groups or something like that, basically saying in November 2021, after Panda Cup was first announced, Nintendo contacted us to jump on a call with a few folks on their team, including a representative from their legal team.
1125320	1133000	We were truly thought that we might be getting shut down, given the fact that they had licensed a competing circuit and partner in Panda.
1133000	1135800	Once we joined the call, we were very surprised to hear the opposite.
1137080	1138760	Then, of course, they had been reached.
1138760	1147720	They reached out to know that they've been watching us for years and they, you know, wanted to see if we were interested in working with them and pursue a license as well.
1147720	1153320	So originally they had kind of gotten somewhat of a license for 2022, but in 2023 was in the air.
1153480	1160920	Then after all this, there's not a lot of time to 2023, especially if you want to plan tournaments, you got to get people more than six weeks to plan for it.
1160920	1163640	And we're less like four weeks from 2023 at this point.
1163640	1164920	So, yeah.
1164920	1165400	Okay.
1165400	1165960	Anyway, go ahead.
1166840	1179000	Um, so then a Nintendo spokesperson, um, had told Kotaku, for example, that unfortunately, after continuous conversations with Smash World Tour, and after giving some deep considerations, we apply any potential partner.
1179000	1183880	We were unable to come to an agreement with Smash World Tour for full circuit in 2023.
1183880	1196280	Nintendo did not request any changes or cancellations of the remaining events in 2022, including the 2022 championship event and consider the negative impact on players who are already planning to participate.
1196280	1216680	Um, of course, then Smash World Tour, um, organizers had been, you know, they disputed the statement saying that unfortunately, um, or, uh, as a last ditch effort, we, uh, asked if we could continue running the championship and the tour next year without a license and shift our focus working with them in 2024.
1216680	1223800	We alluded how last year's function in the capacity with mutual understanding that we would not get shut down and focus on the future.
1223800	1224920	We were told differently.
1224920	1226600	Those times are now over.
1226600	1234040	And this was the final, the final nail in the coffin given to, um, the very, our very particular relationship with Nintendo.
1234040	1237400	This is when we realized it was truly all being shut down for real.
1237400	1244120	We asked if they understood the waves that would make, uh, being forced to cancel and the Nintendo communicated that they were indeed aware.
1244120	1253480	Um, but I remember them saying though, also that they they've also issued yet Nintendo's issued a second statement saying that, um, that's how you know, this is messy.
1253480	1258280	I'm sorry, Nintendo actually, number one, Nintendo commenting at all is kind of a shock.
1258280	1263960	The fact that they're commented on it twice, this is a communications disaster.
1263960	1272200	This is a communications disaster, and you can hear it in these statements because very clearly everybody has their own perspective.
1272200	1275160	Nobody can agree on what the fuck is actually going on.
1276360	1286840	Yeah, cause they said that, uh, Nintendo's decision, uh, was solely based on our assessment for the proposals submitted by SWT and our evaluations of their unlicensed activities.
1286840	1290840	This decision was not influenced by external partners like Panda Global.
1290840	1297880	Any partner that we grant a license to has to meet some high standards we require when it comes to the health and safety of our fans.
1297880	1306920	It also is important that our partners adhere to our brand and IP guidelines and conduct themselves according to professional organizational best practices.
1306920	1310920	We use this same approach, um, to independently assess all partners.
1310920	1314760	If we discover a partner is doing something inappropriate, we will work to correct it.
1314760	1330200	When we notify SWT that we would not license their 2022 or 2023 activities, we also let them know verbally that we were not requiring they cancel the 2022 final events because of the impact it would have on all players.
1330200	1336040	Thus the decision to cancel SWT 2022 was and still is their own choice.
1336920	1343880	Uh, we are open to partnering with other organizations that will continue to offer licenses for major tournaments outside of the Panda Cup.
1343880	1351240	Panda Global will continue to be a key partner and we look forward to receiving proposals from other groups and tournament licenses, et cetera.
1351240	1357080	Um, I need Katie Porter and her fucking whiteboard right now because I don't understand any of this.
1357080	1363400	I think it's fucking stupid anyways that you have to like license from Nintendo to run a tournament for a game.
1363400	1373480	Like, I think part of it though is because you have to use their, uh, intellectual property and advertisement, the name of it, everything, it's all licensing.
1374280	1376600	So that absolutely makes 100% sense.
1376600	1379000	It's like SuperbOwl, that type of thing.
1380760	1381260	Yeah.
1381800	1388120	But yeah, um, Mike Deaf brings up an interesting thing, subsequent thing that has happened to make this even messier, uh, in chat.
1388120	1392680	Uh, and I was reading about this online too, is that apparently a lot of Panda Global members have now quit the org.
1393400	1397080	Because of this whole, you know, how often do we see this in gaming?
1397640	1399400	It doesn't even matter what the news is.
1399400	1400600	It's what's perceived.
1400600	1409080	So in this situation, it definitely seems there's a perception there that Panda somehow strong are in Nintendo into shutting down Smash World Tour.
1409080	1411320	I'm not saying that's what actually happened.
1411320	1419160	I'm just saying clearly that perception is out there because 80% they're saying of people behind Panda Global are leaving.
1419160	1420120	So now what?
1420120	1421960	So, but I will say this, I will say this.
1422760	1427720	Kudos to those people that work for these things.
1427720	1435400	And, you know, don't, I don't think they're donating their time, but spend their time on these types of events and so forth for being able to walk away.
1435400	1439320	Because basically they're saying, without us, you're fucked.
1439320	1439820	Good luck.
1440360	1443160	And they're effectively shutting down Panda by doing this.
1445160	1447320	Uh, dark soccer, your mute hard mute on discord.
1450360	1450920	There we go.
1451000	1454040	I do wonder who could actually strong arm Nintendo.
1454040	1455160	I mean, realistically.
1457400	1463800	Well, Nintendo is not going to put on these events themselves, but I mean, they're just doing themselves a disservice.
1463800	1467640	Nintendo doesn't really need the money or advertising.
1467640	1470360	No, they've already sold the games and they've sold the DLC.
1470360	1472840	I mean, this is just bonus.
1473400	1480680	Yeah, no, it's just keeping the IP around for the inevitable sequel that will come out, whether Sakurai does it or not.
1480920	1487000	There will be another Smash Brothers for the next system, uh, somehow, some way.
1487000	1490040	Um, but yeah, it's just, you're right.
1490040	1494200	Nintendo doesn't necessarily have a horse in the race at the end of the day.
1494760	1501960	So it's just interesting that everybody's cutting themselves off to, to, um, yeah.
1501960	1504680	And then at the end of the day, everyone is giving a different story.
1504680	1505000	Yeah.
1505000	1508920	And at the end of the day, it's the fans and the competitors that are suffering truly.
1508920	1514040	And this'll just, this'll go exactly back to where I'm sure none of these people won it.
1514040	1521720	And that is stores at com or excuse me, uh, tournaments at small stores, comic book shops around the country that there's too many of them.
1521720	1522520	They can't shut them down.
1523160	1530200	You know, homegrown tournaments, the way, the way we used to do it in the DDR scene, we didn't eat Konami's permission to do a fucking DDR tournament.
1530200	1531160	We just did it.
1531160	1533880	Cause Konami was like, here's some free shit.
1533880	1534520	Actually, actually.
1534520	1534760	Yeah.
1534760	1537320	The Bay Area, they oftentimes donated stuff.
1537400	1541400	So I guess maybe it's a terrible compare, but that was back when Konami was cool.
1541400	1543960	Like, you know, now the whole joke is maybe Konami would Sue.
1543960	1547480	If you tried to do it these days, uh, I guess there are so ridiculous though.
1547480	1553560	Like, I mean, cause like you look at stuff like Evo and stuff like that, where they've had to take smash out because of this nonsense.
1553560	1555720	So yeah, it's Nintendo.
1555720	1557160	It's always Nintendo.
1557160	1561720	It's always the understanding how to like interact with the community and stuff.
1561720	1563880	It's just, I don't know.
1564440	1566760	And I get it like, Oh, it's Japanese company.
1566760	1572280	But that, that argument's only going to take you so far.
1572840	1582760	It's, you know, especially now that we're in this era of, we know Nintendo is just as guilty of some of this or allegedly just as guilty of some of this union busting stuff.
1583320	1586840	The way they treat their workers, their contractors or their full-time stuff.
1586840	1593480	They, they are guilty of, you know, um, infection within the game industry, as much as a lot of other companies out there.
1593480	1594440	Nintendo is not immune to this.
1594440	1597960	So this whole excuse of they're just a Japanese company don't fly anymore.
1600120	1600920	So, yeah.
1600920	1601420	Yeah.
1604120	1612840	Things that go beyond culture, you know, universally accepted things, especially when you're playing on a world market.
1612840	1613240	Right.
1613240	1624280	Well, and it's kind of like, you know, I realize it's a little apple to oranges, but you know, I think about the story we just had a few weeks ago about Square Enix and that really, really poor statement.
1624280	1628680	From Yoshi P on why there are no people of color in Final Fantasy 16.
1628680	1634760	And we had a whole discussion about Japanese developers are just, it's there.
1634760	1637400	They, they don't see it the same way.
1637400	1639000	It's not in their culture the same way.
1639000	1643800	This is a problem in the Japanese development industry that needs to be addressed.
1643800	1645560	Not just Yoshi P statement.
1645560	1648440	Yoshi P statement is a symptom of that problem.
1648440	1663160	So it would be interesting to see what Japanese developers kind of have to face in the next, you know, few years, because we've already had ironically Square Enix come out and say we need to make games that appeal on a global scale.
1663160	1668280	And then they say that with one hand, and then the other hand, they do something to actively work against that.
1669640	1676360	Anyway, and I do want to point out something that's going back from like old anime arguments, like from the 80s and whatnot.
1677160	1680040	Technically, they're based off Japanese models.
1681880	1685560	I mean, they're not really even I mean, in modern 3D games.
1685560	1691640	Yeah, but just like people would have the same argument about anime, but technically, they weren't white there either.
1693000	1705800	So anyway, my point is, this whole Nintendo is a Japanese company, and they just do things differently that the amount of times you can use that excuse is has run out for Nintendo.
1705800	1708520	Like we now do business on a global scale.
1708520	1710360	Video games is a global business.
1710360	1715080	All of these things are global, like that certain things are just going to have to change.
1715720	1722600	And the way they approach communication is one of those things that very clearly has to change.
1722600	1725640	Again, I'm shocked they put out two statements to be quite honest.
1726760	1734920	And I can even read between the lines on that second statement that apparently the Smash World Tour did something that they didn't like.
1734920	1745800	But they're just not being clear in what that is for probably professional reasons, because it's not very nice to call out people in a very public way about what it is they did.
1745800	1751960	But I feel like that's what the internet and the fans need to hear is what specifically is the problem.
1753320	1755000	But we're not going to know.
1755000	1756280	It's just that's that's how it is.
1756280	1759160	We're never going to know unless it comes out in court.
1759160	1761800	Maybe that's where this whole thing ends up in a courtroom somewhere.
1762360	1763560	Sure seems destined that way.
1765160	1768200	Anyway, less destined for a courtroom.
1768920	1772520	Hopefully us and the video games we've been playing this week.
1772520	1776520	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.
1776520	1778920	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming month?
1781400	1785320	I played, of course, a lot of Dead by Daylight.
1785320	1787080	Been playing actually with a lot of different people.
1787800	1795160	I ended up like doing the playing on Thursday for Thirst Trap, apart from my own streams.
1795160	1803560	And then for the last two weeks in a row, I always would get an invite from Intoxicated to play as well.
1804200	1809720	So I've been on like seven hour Dead by Daylight binges where thankfully I don't have to do a lot of talking.
1809720	1812920	But it was just like, where did this come from?
1814040	1816280	I was lurking in Intoxicated's channel one night.
1816280	1817560	It was like midnight or something.
1817560	1821080	I was playing a game on my first monitor and I was channel surfing on Twitch, as I often do.
1821080	1824520	And I heard you and saw you in the chat and I just cracked up.
1824520	1828760	I was gonna say hi, but I was like, sometimes it's more fun to just lurk.
1829640	1830140	Yeah.
1832680	1834920	Were you there to see the four megs?
1835800	1837480	No, that doesn't sound familiar.
1837480	1839640	I will send you a picture of the four megs.
1839640	1841400	He was getting tunneled out.
1842520	1844280	And he was really puffy about that.
1845080	1846200	Things have been stinky.
1846920	1851240	Yeah, the game needs a kick in the butt.
1851240	1851640	I don't know.
1851640	1852680	I don't know what else to say about it.
1852680	1855240	It just needs a kick in the butt beyond just continued DLC.
1855240	1858360	They need to stop rewarding people for having no skill.
1860200	1866840	At any rate, I also do want to remind other players that if you log into your account every day,
1867720	1872200	then they're doing the December advent calendar for Dead by Daylight where you can get
1872760	1876520	uh, usually 25,000 blood points.
1876520	1881480	There will be like a big bunch of stuff for Christmas and Christmas Eve and a couple of
1881480	1885560	weekends where you get 50,000 where you get rift shards and iridescent shards.
1886120	1889720	So, um, definitely good thing to do.
1889720	1892200	Even if you're not planning on playing that day, just log into your game.
1893160	1899800	Um, I have a game that I super, super want, but I don't have the hundred bucks to
1899800	1900760	dump on it right now.
1901640	1907240	And I really want Marvel Midnight Suns because I want the, the legendary so I can get all
1907240	1910200	the outfits and the DLC do the whole game.
1911240	1917480	Um, but I'm taking donations of steam wallet gift certificates.
1917480	1918200	Everybody.
1918200	1918760	I'm kidding.
1919400	1925960	Um, I have also, of course, I did my stupid word scapes game, which, uh, kind of getting
1925960	1926600	annoyed with it.
1927160	1930760	Um, I played a little cult of the lamb.
1930760	1933000	I've played Final Fantasy five.
1933000	1941480	We just got the submarine last night and, um, I played something else and I can't remember
1941480	1943160	for the life of me what it was.
1945640	1951320	Oh, well, as I say, I watched you play in Final Fantasy five as well, but it must be
1951320	1953480	something you didn't stream because I didn't, you know,
1954040	1956280	well, I, I play stuff that I do on stream.
1956280	1960120	It's just like, um, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
1960120	1962840	Uh, I started to play a little bit of hooked on you again.
1963480	1965640	They just had an update for it, but I didn't.
1966520	1969400	I like kind of logged into it and then I was like, oh, I got stuff to do.
1969400	1975720	So I've been playing around a lot in like DAZ 3d trying to make different, you know,
1976280	1980520	3d models and stuff and thinking about making my Vtuber in it.
1981080	1981560	Oh, okay.
1982040	1982520	Oh, cool.
1982520	1983020	Yeah.
1983240	1985960	So we did get the Genesis mini too.
1985960	1987160	I'm just going to add that in.
1987160	1989240	Oh, there was some play on that.
1989800	1990520	Nice.
1990520	1992280	Any games that stuck out for you?
1993880	1995160	We played Space Harrier.
1996520	1998200	There's a lot of good stuff on there.
1998200	2000040	You know, it's just good old Genesis games.
2000040	2003320	We raided somebody last week cause you, you weren't here after the show.
2003320	2007080	So we did a couple of raids on some, some randos and one week, one week I did an old
2007080	2008200	DDR freak pal.
2008200	2009560	One of the weeks you weren't here.
2009800	2013640	I let Bobby pick last week and he, he picked somebody he knows through games done quick
2013640	2015160	and I'm sure he'll shout out who it was in chat.
2015160	2020200	But the reason why I bring it up is that the raid message was a welcome to the fantasy
2020200	2022040	zone, get ready with the whole space Harrier thing.
2022040	2024120	And I was like, oh, I wish dark soccer has seen that.
2024120	2027000	Cause that's like legit like her thing.
2027000	2031880	So my, well, my channel is technically nicknamed the fantasy zone.
2031880	2032280	Yeah.
2032280	2032780	Yeah.
2033080	2036280	So cartridge blowers was the name of the streamer says Bobby.
2036280	2037720	So I like it.
2037720	2038200	I like it.
2038200	2045480	We'll have to, uh, and I've, I've, you know, I've been talking with people about doing
2045480	2048760	some Twitch related things in the public.
2048760	2051080	So keep your eyes open maybe.
2051080	2051580	Okay.
2052520	2052840	All right.
2052840	2053960	No, I'm keeping them shut.
2053960	2054460	Okay.
2055400	2056760	Then I'm going to eat my spaghetti.
2057640	2057960	All right.
2057960	2058920	Moving on.
2058920	2060200	Let's go to Loki.
2060200	2061080	How was your gaming week?
2061720	2063720	It was all Minecraft as usual.
2063720	2066360	I've been just trying to like grind out stuff.
2066360	2070360	It's been a month since I put out a video on the channel, 64 SMPs.
2070360	2075480	This is because I had a really complicated build in redstone stuff and it's done.
2076280	2078680	Um, just editing the video now.
2079960	2080280	Awesome.
2080280	2088440	So the film stuff, but yeah, it, it was, um, it came out good, but it was a journey to
2088440	2089000	get it done.
2090760	2091260	All right.
2091720	2095000	Well, if that's it, uh, I'll go to my gaming week.
2095000	2098520	Um, a lot of the same stuff, a little bit of dead by daylight, but not a lot.
2098520	2104040	Um, I also played, um, Uh, a little more vampire survivors.
2104040	2105960	Cause I've been talking about that on previous shows.
2105960	2109320	I've been into that, um, Pokemon crack.
2109320	2109720	It is.
2109720	2113320	And I want to get that other one that, um, Nick was playing the soul survivors or whatever
2113320	2113800	it's called.
2113800	2115960	I want to get that one also pretty.
2115960	2120120	So I'll probably grab that at some point, but when I stream, I really try to limit myself
2120120	2121320	to Pokemon scarlet.
2121320	2122760	I'm way behind everyone else.
2122760	2126360	Cause I just, I with, I've had some other stuff going on personally this week.
2126360	2129880	So I just have not really been able to get around to streaming and I've been seeing my
2129880	2131560	Pokemon scarlet gameplay for stream.
2131560	2133400	I know people have run circles around that game.
2133400	2133720	Now.
2133720	2138520	Shane has beat both violet and scarlet at this point is in how many times he completed
2138520	2140040	his decks completely.
2140040	2141800	So I know like, yeah.
2141800	2147000	So, and I'm, I'm sitting here going, I have seven badges, but now keep in mind, it's not
2147000	2148120	just eight gym badges.
2148200	2149720	It's eight gym badges.
2149720	2155000	I think five Titan badges and maybe five star badges, question mark.
2155000	2158840	Somebody will might correct me on that if I'm wrong, but I have seven.
2158840	2160280	So I have two, two and three.
2160280	2162440	I have three gyms and two of the, two of the other ones.
2162440	2164440	So I'm a little behind, but that's okay.
2164440	2164920	You know what?
2164920	2166120	I do things at my own pace.
2166120	2168040	It took me a year to beat sword and shield.
2168040	2168920	So I'm fine.
2168920	2170600	I'm, I'm, I'm moving on with it.
2170600	2171080	It's it's fine.
2172920	2177720	So I've been playing that the other game I've been playing is really surprised me.
2178360	2181080	I didn't even know if I wanted to talk about it tonight, but I'm going to, cause I know
2181080	2184840	I'm going to get made fun of for this, but I I'm like, whatever, you know what?
2184840	2187880	I'm all about honesty and transparency here on orange knowledge radio.
2189000	2191320	I haven't been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14 lately.
2192120	2193960	There's a little bit of a content lull in the game.
2195160	2198360	The free company that I was in is basically falling apart.
2198360	2199640	Well, I shouldn't say that.
2199640	2203240	I don't really know the people in my free company and like, but, but all of the friends
2203240	2205480	that I play with, none of them are playing anymore.
2206040	2208760	So I like don't have anything to do right now.
2208760	2215800	I I've not fallen out of love with a Final Fantasy 14 by any means, but I'm just in a
2215800	2217560	lull and I'm just kind of like, you know what?
2218600	2221000	Yoshi P and Final Fantasy 14.
2221000	2222600	I think it's not you, it's me.
2223160	2225480	We just need to see, see other people for a little while.
2225480	2227720	We just need to, we just, and you know what?
2228600	2233880	One of my, one of my old F buddies just put out a new expansion this week.
2235560	2237480	And so I reactivated my wow account.
2238920	2243480	I'm, I'm not touching any of those games until what the fuck is gone.
2243480	2245800	I, I, I understand those concerns.
2247320	2248760	And I'm not happy about it either.
2249320	2253320	I feel like after the behavior of another person who has association with the company,
2253320	2254520	I'm kind of disgusted.
2254520	2261480	I, I have to walk a fine line here because I have several friends that work at said company
2261480	2264760	and I want to respect their work, but still hate their CEO.
2265480	2269880	As I've said a few weeks ago on this show, when I was talking about Overwatch 2 and,
2269880	2275160	you know, Diablo and some of that, here's the thing is that, well, number one, you know,
2275160	2278600	we all know the standby, there's no ethical consumption or capitalism, blah, blah, blah,
2278600	2279000	that whole thing.
2279000	2280440	You have to pick your battles, blah, blah, blah.
2281240	2287400	All of these problems that started with Activision Blizzard are very clearly industry-wide
2287400	2287880	problems.
2289000	2296840	So I would have to quit gaming to really, you know, suitably address all of the issues
2296840	2297240	that are going on.
2297240	2298440	I have to quit Nintendo games.
2299000	2300760	We've talked about that in a previous episode.
2300760	2302600	I'd have to quit Ubisoft games.
2302600	2305800	I'd have to go, you know, you name it, there's problems everywhere.
2305800	2307720	All of these problems are at every studio.
2307720	2313160	So I feel like we have to walk a line and I want to encourage my friends that are, you
2313160	2316440	know, working hard on these types of things and really incur well.
2316440	2320920	And also through that, I've also heard, and I don't know what I can and can't say, so
2320920	2324120	I'm always going to err on the side of can't say, because people tell me these things in
2324120	2329160	confidence, that there are real tangible changes that are going on in the culture.
2329160	2333400	And I've been told specifically some of the changes that happened versus the way it used
2333400	2333900	to be.
2334600	2338280	So there is change happening, even if it isn't always visible.
2339160	2341320	Like I said, part of my reason is also spite.
2342280	2343080	I understand.
2343080	2344040	That's your reason.
2344040	2344840	This is my reason.
2345400	2351960	So I just, you know, I was kind of curious, like actually what it was.
2351960	2355480	And it wasn't just the whole new expansion, actually.
2355480	2361160	I was super curious about WoW Classic, which just bumped up to Wrath of the Lich King.
2361160	2363480	And I was like, it really was.
2363480	2368920	I want to go shack up with my ex and I want to go play Wrath of the Lich King for a little
2368920	2369480	bit.
2369480	2374520	And so I was like, all right, whatever, I'm going to pay the money, the 15 bucks to try
2374520	2376360	this month and go play Classic Wrath.
2376360	2378200	And I was actually having a really good time with it.
2378200	2379640	Yes, it's a grind.
2379640	2381960	Yes, you know, but it really was.
2381960	2385880	It felt like playing an old PlayStation 2 RPG.
2385880	2391320	You know, like I'm going back to visit this old friend and, you know, I'm having a good
2391320	2391820	time with it.
2392440	2397720	Where the game started to lose me a little bit is when I got up to the content where
2397720	2405240	I could run dungeons, there's hardly anybody online and there's no dungeon finders.
2405800	2409720	So you can't find people like nobody's doing the baby dungeons.
2409720	2412600	If anybody's online doing dungeons, they're all doing the end game stuff.
2412600	2415720	And since there's no dungeon finder, they're all doing shouts and all that stuff.
2415720	2419800	So that's when I started to be like, all right, I'm kind of running out of stuff to do.
2420520	2422120	So that's why I went, you know what?
2422120	2422440	Fuck it.
2422440	2424520	Let me go see what's going on in retail.
2424520	2427480	By the way, you'll notice I never said I bought the expansion.
2427720	2428220	I haven't.
2428920	2433880	I just said, all right, since I re-upped this sub so I could play classic anyway, let me
2433880	2436520	see what the hell's going on in retail.
2436520	2437020	Wow.
2437880	2443080	And I got to say, because I haven't touched it in quite a long time, I was very like,
2443720	2450440	holy shit, this game has changed because I guess with this most recent expansion, they
2450440	2452120	actually completely redid the UI.
2452680	2454760	And you want to know what the gag is about the UI?
2454760	2458920	It is extremely Final Fantasy XIV's UI.
2461480	2464440	Now, but this is what's fascinating about it.
2464440	2465720	That's actually not a dig on WoW.
2466360	2471640	This is actually where I wanted WoW to be like five years ago when WoW was very boring
2471640	2473560	to me, was that I was like, you know what?
2473560	2478840	Warcraft maybe needs to get knocked off of its pedestal a little bit to really see what
2478840	2483000	else is going on out there and maybe take influence from some of the other kids out
2483000	2483560	on the market.
2484200	2487800	And it took a little while, but boy, oh boy, does it seem like that's exactly what's
2487800	2488600	happened.
2488600	2496120	And I'm noticing an extreme amount of increase in the amount of cut scenes, voice acting
2496120	2500120	and the other types of music and the other types of things that Final Fantasy XIV is
2500120	2500840	known for.
2500840	2501560	But you know what?
2501560	2507160	This isn't just a, haha, WoW is more like Final Fantasy XIV because guess what?
2507160	2510120	This is a silical thing in the industry.
2510120	2512520	This goes round and round because you know what?
2512520	2519800	Final Fantasy XIV 1.0, remember, sucked ass bad.
2522360	2527400	And when they redid 2.0 in Realm Reborn, do you remember what Yoshi P cited as one of
2527400	2530280	the big influences for Final Fantasy XIV in Realm Reborn?
2531160	2532040	World of Warcraft.
2533480	2539160	So now we're at a point with these MMOs where it's clear that it's not just one influencing
2539160	2541720	the other, they're influencing each other.
2542680	2545800	That is the coolest part of, I think, what I've experienced so far.
2545800	2548840	I'm like, it blows my mind.
2548840	2554440	The UI has a UI edit mode and it is like, it is exactly Final Fantasy XIV's UI edit
2554440	2554840	mode.
2554840	2555640	Exactly.
2555640	2559560	Like it's not, it's different components because it's WoW versus XIV, but like the
2559560	2565160	UI edit thing is exactly like move this frame here, resize it, move this, the little things
2565160	2566120	in the corner.
2566120	2567800	It's all, it's all XIV's UI.
2569320	2569640	Good.
2572040	2576680	But like how many people replace all that shit anyway using deadly boss mods?
2576680	2577480	So true.
2577480	2578440	So true.
2578440	2582520	Because I was watching Twitch streamers play it because that was also a big part of my,
2582520	2584840	I wonder, I wonder what my ex is up to.
2585720	2590040	Twitch was a huge enabler in that department and wondering what my ex is up to and watch
2590040	2590520	what's going on.
2590520	2594760	And I, I see all these different streams like I can't fucking tell shit for shit from
2594760	2596600	all these mods that people are running.
2596600	2600440	And I had, I didn't, like, I was watching people play the newest expansion.
2600440	2603880	I was like, I, I don't know what the hell's going on here outside of the cut scenes and
2603880	2607480	some of these other things because I cannot understand their UI.
2607480	2612920	But when I saw the default UI for the first time, when I booted up WoW retail, I was like,
2613560	2616440	I legit texted Shane right away.
2616440	2622040	And I was like, you didn't tell me that, wow, like didn't just like get some influence
2622040	2625960	from Final Fantasy XIV, but like got like a lot of influence from Final Fantasy XIV.
2627080	2631400	See, I was actually about to re-up my XIV account.
2634040	2638040	And like I said, everything I've just talked about has nothing to do with like, I dislike
2638040	2638920	XIV or anything.
2638920	2640360	I'll be back there when the new patch is out.
2640360	2645320	There's just a content lol for me, but I've, I've played, I literally have maxed out everything
2645320	2647160	you can do on Island Sanctuary.
2647160	2648680	I don't end game raid.
2648680	2652360	There's nothing left for me right now, but there will be in subsequent patches.
2652360	2652760	Cool.
2652760	2653880	I'll look forward to that.
2653880	2658360	I'm actually glad for a change because usually Final Fantasy XIV and WoW kind of release
2658360	2659720	content on the same day.
2659720	2662600	I don't know if it's intentional or not, but like they didn't do that this time.
2662600	2665000	And I think that's really good actually.
2665000	2666200	So yeah.
2666840	2667720	So anyway, yeah.
2667720	2671960	Miramews in chat says, we'll be here for your hangover and walk of shame in a few weeks.
2671960	2672520	Thank you.
2672520	2673400	Appreciate that.
2673960	2677080	Mike Defton chat says, competition brings innovation.
2677080	2677580	Yep.
2678360	2681400	SSJ100Matt says, so Horde House coming back when?
2681640	2687400	Um, actually grandpa's been asking when he can come on Orange Lounge Radio.
2687400	2690840	And I said, as soon as he can clean up his mouth, cause the jokes he used to make back
2690840	2692360	then aren't going to fly today.
2692360	2697400	So that's one, but at some point, but then Shane's like, oh, we need to stream or something.
2697400	2701160	So really all I need to do is call X Defer and we probably could get a reunion.
2701160	2703000	So just, you know, wait for it.
2703000	2706760	Um, SSJ100Matt also says, hey boo, you up?
2706760	2707960	Rob's text to wow.
2711960	2715400	Questbuster says, no shame taking a break to play something else.
2715400	2716120	Uh, yeah.
2716120	2717480	Dark Tetsuya's huh?
2718200	2719640	Just what went in through my head.
2719640	2720680	No booty calls.
2723480	2724600	That's not happening.
2726680	2729720	Dark Tetsuya said Rob's breaking up with Final Fantasy 14.
2729720	2731480	No, we're not breaking up.
2731480	2733560	We're just opening the relationship for a little bit.
2733560	2733960	That's all.
2734040	2736360	All right.
2737880	2738200	All right.
2738200	2739480	So that was my gaming week.
2739480	2740280	There you go.
2740280	2743240	Now you all know why I didn't want to talk about it, but I'm going to, I'm going to be
2743240	2744600	honest here on orange launch radio.
2744600	2745160	That's what I do.
2746040	2746360	All right.
2747640	2751880	Uh, if you want to, if you want to send your comments and gaming weeks and all that good
2751880	2756120	stuff, send us an email, participate at orange launch radio.com is a great place to do that.
2756120	2756920	All right.
2756920	2758520	Let's get into some news.
2758520	2759880	I would get into housekeeping.
2759880	2761320	I don't really have anything tonight.
2761960	2765640	Bobby Black Wolf is going to be off for the next couple of weeks, just for personal vacation
2765640	2766040	reasons.
2766600	2771000	So we'll be starting, you know, right at nine Eastern, six Pacific VOG.
2771000	2774280	But as far as our show goes, we don't, you know, it's the holidays.
2774280	2778520	So the news will be a little less just, but, you know, probably not next week.
2778520	2780040	The game awards are happening this week.
2780040	2783320	So I expect we're gonna have a lot of game announcements to dig into next week.
2783880	2787240	We're not going to be able to do a co-stream of the game awards though, because I have
2787240	2787960	other commitments.
2788680	2792680	Bobby is working with the aforementioned vacation.
2794360	2797640	So I just think it's not going to happen this year, but I do hope you all enjoy the game
2797640	2798140	awards.
2798760	2799720	I think it'll be interesting.
2799720	2801880	We'll talk more about the game awards a little later on in the show.
2803160	2806920	I'm still trying to figure out if we're going to be here on December 25th, which I'm sure
2806920	2808280	you all know is Christmas day.
2809000	2814520	I just need to make sure nothing's going on in my family, meaning really Alan's family
2814520	2816840	is the one we usually do December 25th with.
2816840	2820200	As soon as I know that, I'll be able to know if I'm going to be here or not.
2821080	2826280	But Dark Soccer and I have been talking about going out for Chinese food, which used to
2826280	2828040	be a tradition of sorts.
2828040	2829160	Then the pandemic happened.
2829960	2831400	So this would be the first time in a while.
2832200	2834360	So it'll be good.
2834360	2834840	All right.
2834840	2835800	We'll see what happens.
2835800	2837000	We'll see what happens.
2837000	2837560	All right.
2837560	2839560	Let's get into some more gaming news.
2839560	2843560	Because, you know, even though we are in the holidays, this period between Thanksgiving
2843560	2848040	and, you know, all the December holidays, there's still some gaming news going on.
2848040	2849720	And of course, the game awards happening this week.
2849720	2853960	But first off, Loki in the not so great news column.
2854680	2856520	Yeah, let's talk about harmonics.
2856520	2861400	So, you know, we're talking about a game shutting down because that's whatever it is that we
2861400	2862680	talk about harmonics nowadays.
2863480	2867960	Fuser, they're kind of a DJ mixing sim.
2868760	2874760	The online services for that will be shutting down December 19th.
2874760	2876600	So a couple of weeks.
2877160	2884440	And basically, you know, the DLC and stuff will still be available until then.
2884440	2887720	But you'll only be able to play through the campaign in quick play.
2889240	2891080	You won't be able to play online, obviously.
2891080	2897160	So that's unfortunate, considering that they're bought by Epic.
2897160	2900920	And I think they have the money to, you know, keep those servers up.
2901800	2902300	Yeah.
2903400	2907560	You know, it's well, they are doing their Fortnite now.
2907560	2909160	Harmonics is a Fortnite company.
2909160	2914840	They've said as much, but the most, you know, it's Alan plays a lot of Fortnite now.
2914840	2917160	That's like the game he's been playing a lot of lately.
2917160	2919720	So, you know, I've been picking up on a lot of Fortnite.
2920040	2921960	You know, I've been picking up on what's going on.
2921960	2925320	The no build mode really changed Fortnite for the better for a lot of people.
2925960	2927000	And Alan's one of them.
2927000	2930200	And even for me, I'm like, oh, yeah, if they took the building crap out of Fortnite, I'd
2930200	2931000	be interested in it.
2931560	2934040	So he's going to teach me how to play at some point on a stream.
2934040	2935320	So we'll do that.
2936200	2941880	But I always thought Fortnite was most fascinating when it did like the concerts and the movie
2941880	2945320	premieres and the trailer premieres, whatever, and the pop culture stuff.
2945320	2948840	And we're talking about this a little bit on Bobby show on before us tonight.
2948840	2952600	I think it's important to state when we talk about the Ariana Grande concert, which I'm
2952600	2958120	sure harmonics or what's left of it had something to do with as it's been absorbed into epic.
2958760	2961480	The Ariana Grande concert wasn't really a concert.
2961480	2962680	We keep calling it that.
2962680	2967000	But it wasn't like you were just standing there watching a fake avatar on the stage,
2967000	2969080	fake lip syncing to fake songs and stuff.
2969080	2969880	It wasn't what it was.
2970520	2974200	It was an interactive music video, keyword interactive.
2974200	2975320	You were the interaction.
2975880	2978600	And that's what made that kind of neat.
2978920	2982120	I'll let you go download Bobby show if you want to hear a much longer discussion, because
2982120	2988280	we talked about how honestly when it comes to like meta, the companies or Facebook, if
2988280	2992040	you will, metaverse, it's a joke.
2992040	2997320	It's literally a joke because it's just trying to bring us something we've seen before.
2997320	2999640	Whereas say what you will about epic.
2999640	3004120	I'm not always a fan of how Tim Sweeney can touch himself online and some of his tweets
3004120	3007960	and some of the fights he gets into, even if I will always be a fan of ZZT.
3007960	3010120	And I do like some of the things that Fortnite is doing.
3010120	3011000	Bring back ZZT.
3011000	3013640	Come on, Fortnite season four or five.
3013640	3018120	Isn't it wild to think that that guy made ZZT?
3018120	3022920	But then you look at Fortnite and what it's doing.
3022920	3028200	And quite honestly, Loki, you see seeds of that in ZZT.
3028200	3032120	If you want to go way back, somebody had to have done a YouTube analysis.
3032920	3035320	Is there some of you YouTube fans?
3036760	3041480	Is there like a three hour YouTube analysis on how ZZT influenced Fortnite?
3041480	3043800	Because if there's not, there really should be the same.
3044840	3048360	I'm just saying like, I know that they tried to push that whole like, I don't remember
3048360	3049320	what it was called now.
3049320	3054680	It was a platform that was basically unreal, but it was like, oh, I thought you were going
3054680	3056360	to say ZZT oop.
3056360	3060040	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but there's that too.
3060120	3066920	But like what I'm saying is if they just took ZZT and like, you know, made it kind of polygonal
3066920	3071480	and stuff, but still kind of ZZT where you're building it with blocks.
3071480	3076520	The super ZZT we were always promised and technically got, but lightning didn't hit
3076520	3076920	twice.
3076920	3079080	Yeah, no, I'm talking about something more modern than that.
3079080	3081000	Not like sticking to ASCII characters.
3081000	3084920	I'm talking about like, you know, still building with blocks and everything, but, you know,
3084920	3090120	and doing maybe even like it'd be the 2D or 2D, you know, over the top types of gameplay
3090120	3095080	still, but like being able to build stuff out of that would be pretty awesome.
3095080	3097800	Well, and here, you know what's funny?
3097800	3101640	There's actually, it's funny you bring that up and then I see in chat, I can't see actually
3101640	3103960	says I just like epic free games.
3103960	3107800	Ironic that you bring that up because one of the epic free games in the store right
3107800	3110120	now is an RPG making game.
3110120	3112200	It's not RPG maker, but a different one.
3112920	3116360	Somebody will probably yell it out in a chat before I get my epic game store up over here,
3116360	3119320	but it's actually a make your RPG game.
3119320	3123240	It's almost exactly what you're describing, Loki, except it's specifically for RPGs.
3123240	3126920	But otherwise, like it's create your own 3D voxel art type of thing.
3126920	3132520	And like it's literally the free game on the epic store right now until like the 15th.
3132520	3135880	So it's funny you bring that up because I'm like, actually, that's kind of what's in the
3135880	3136760	epic store right now.
3136760	3137720	RPG in a box.
3137720	3138520	Thank you.
3138520	3141320	I can't see that is what's called RPG in a box.
3141320	3142680	So all right.
3144600	3148200	Jason in chat says I haven't watched any videos, but I found a video with the title.
3148200	3153000	Why epic games took 25 years to make Fortnite that could have relevance to your idea.
3153000	3153500	Yes.
3155160	3156600	Get get the table meme.
3156600	3157480	Get the table meme.
3157480	3158040	Here it is.
3158040	3163560	I'm sitting at the table and my banner at the table says Fortnite is just super ZZT.
3163560	3164280	Change my mind.
3166920	3171160	Anyway, if you don't know what I know, we keep referencing ZZT and there's
3171160	3173960	probably many of you out there that are like, what the fuck are they talking about?
3173960	3180680	It was an old, old 90s DOS game that you could that was the most powerful thing about it
3180680	3186920	was creating your own games and what ultimately became other experiences and other like people
3186920	3192280	would basically create journals of their life and things like that inside this ZZT game.
3192280	3193320	And it was a game.
3193320	3197960	It was big when I was in high school, probably like 95, 94, 95 when this game was out.
3197960	3200200	And Tim Sweeney made it.
3200200	3203640	And he's now the CEO of Epic Games.
3203640	3205880	So basically his company is what brought Fortnite.
3205880	3211080	Now, again, I don't really like a lot of how Tim Sweeney conducts himself online, but I
3211080	3216440	will always be a fan of ZZT and that stuff, you know, that's and it was hugely influential
3216440	3220520	to my career as a gamer and the way I grew up in gaming.
3220520	3226120	And Orangewright also says in episode 561 of OLR, we picked it as a classic game.
3226760	3230280	So I think I did.
3230280	3230760	Did you?
3230760	3232520	Because I was to say that I don't think I did.
3232520	3234200	No, no, no, you would.
3234200	3237400	It was definitely a week you were out and like probably Loki and I were like, what do
3237400	3239480	we both like ZZT?
3239480	3239800	All right.
3239800	3242040	Anyway, let's see.
3242760	3243960	Other comments in chat.
3243960	3249240	So S2100 Matt says, I hope harmonics is still there when the music game market blows up
3249240	3249800	again.
3249800	3253720	My worry is if harmonics gets fully dissolved, like so many of these companies have been
3253720	3256840	doing with consolidations recently and incorporated in Epic.
3257400	3258360	Hopefully, hopefully.
3259480	3262680	Also, I want to point out back to what the story was really about before we got on the
3262680	3265560	Fortnite thing is about Fuser being sunset.
3266120	3266680	Shad Leland.
3266680	3267160	Hi, Shane.
3267160	3271320	In chat says, man, RIP drop mix again, basically.
3271320	3274040	Yeah, but I mean, I'm looking at it going.
3274040	3277160	I didn't really help because I never bought Fuser.
3277160	3278840	I only played it that one weekend.
3278840	3283240	It was free on Xbox, but I was always waiting for that $20 sale that never came.
3283240	3288200	And to be fair, with all the music licensing in the game, it probably was never able to
3288200	3288760	happen.
3288760	3294440	The game was probably too expensive to fund everything in it for that to ever really happen,
3294440	3295800	to be quite honest.
3295800	3297640	So there's that.
3297640	3300760	DJ Rama S asked, did I read Cliffy B's book yet?
3300760	3303480	No, it's sitting on my bookshelf, thanks to a very kind donor.
3304120	3307880	But no, there's a million things to do.
3307880	3309560	So little time to do them, right?
3309640	3316840	Maybe when I go on vacation to a nice desert island that has no Internet coverage, that'll
3316840	3318200	be a book I bring with me for sure.
3318200	3319560	That and my John Waters book.
3319560	3320280	I want to read them both.
3321960	3329080	And I keep wanting to say Jonathan Taylor Thomas, but that's not his name.
3329080	3330040	Jonathan Van Ness.
3331320	3332440	Very different people.
3332440	3333800	My Jonathan Van Ness book.
3334360	3336680	Although, have you ever seen the two of them at the same time?
3336680	3337880	I don't think you have.
3337880	3338380	All right.
3339080	3344680	Anyway, also with Fuser, here's the thing.
3345720	3350200	I think it was a great sandbox and you could do really cool things with it.
3350200	3352440	I don't think the game just didn't make sense.
3353480	3354760	It wasn't much of a game.
3354760	3357080	And I understand there was a game there.
3357080	3361240	I understand some people played it and had fun with it, but I think they just built rules
3361240	3362840	around sandboxing.
3362840	3367400	And so it was just hard to convince people to pay $60 for a really cool sandbox.
3367400	3370520	And let's be real, drop mix was a lot of the same thing.
3370520	3372200	Yes, it was a fun game.
3372200	3377800	If you could get people to actually play it and not just playing with the box until they
3377800	3378440	were done with it.
3379080	3387080	So I just think it was a cool idea, but it wasn't able to really be fully realized as
3387080	3387560	a game.
3387560	3391320	Most of the time, people would wear it out as a sandbox, to be honest.
3391960	3395240	So rest in peace, Fuser.
3395240	3400680	But also when you consider that music licenses are only good for so many years, I mean, it
3400680	3403800	isn't terribly surprising, but it's sad.
3404760	3407320	Yeah, but it's not really that the game's not.
3407320	3409480	I mean, it's just the online services, though.
3409480	3411800	They're not going to sell the game anymore either, from what I understand.
3411800	3416120	I mean, they can't stop you from walking into a GameStop and buying one used, but it's just
3416120	3417960	going to drive up the price of the game, that's for sure.
3419320	3419820	Yeah.
3420780	3427500	All right, let's move on and talk about a new feature that's coming to the PlayStation
3427500	3430620	5, and that is PlayStation tournaments.
3430620	3435580	So PlayStation tournaments have just been launched by Sony Interactive Entertainment,
3435580	3439820	and that was announced this week in one of the PlayStation blog posts.
3439820	3442140	This was already on PlayStation 4.
3442140	3445340	It's just one of those things that they're catching up with now on the PlayStation 5.
3445340	3450380	It was in beta testing for three months, and now it's going to launch with some other
3450380	3456620	changes, including shorter tournament times, seamless console signup, easily discoverable
3456620	3461260	tournaments, a redone interface, real-time match updates, and more.
3461820	3466700	So some of the first official PlayStation tournaments that will be available on the
3466700	3475420	PlayStation 5 will include Guilty Gear Strive, NBA 2K23, and FIFA 23, just in time for the
3475420	3475920	World Cup.
3476620	3481260	You can play and compete to win prizes among these special events, challenges, leaderboard
3481260	3483500	competitions, and so forth with the community.
3483500	3488060	I wonder if Stars are a part of that, because PlayStation Stars finally launched, because
3488060	3491100	I don't fire up my PlayStation all the time, but I did, and I was like, oh, yeah, I got
3491100	3494140	to sign up for this PlayStation Stars thing that's telling me about.
3494140	3498620	So you can use that to, like, they were literally, you could buy games with that.
3499580	3502220	Only certain ones, but I thought it was interesting.
3502220	3506540	So Zen Monkey says PlayStation 4 tournaments was shit.
3506540	3510540	They only had a few games, and they took, like, two years to get it working half right.
3510540	3514940	Well, hopefully the implementation on the 5 is a little bit better, but they only did
3514940	3516700	have it in beta for a few months.
3516700	3522220	So and they did say all of this was from feedback that they got during the beta process.
3522780	3528140	They're also saying that the best PlayStation 5 players will take home accessories like
3528140	3532140	the new DualSense Edge or the Pulse 3D wireless headset.
3532140	3535020	And if you're a PlayStation 4 owner, you can win a PS5 console.
3535020	3536300	Maybe this is the only way to get one.
3536300	3536940	No, I'm just kidding.
3536940	3543660	It's apparently getting a lot easier to get a PS5 console, which, by the way, I'm not
3543660	3545420	getting a PS5 for Christmas.
3545420	3546220	I just found out.
3546220	3549900	I found out what I am getting for Christmas, but I don't want to say on air yet, but I'm
3549900	3551980	hoping I'll be able to show you all next week.
3552780	3554940	So stay tuned for that.
3554940	3558780	But it's not going to be a PlayStation 5 because Alan and I already ruined Christmas for each
3558780	3559900	other because we do that.
3559900	3563180	So all right, let's see.
3565100	3569900	The Winathon badge on a tournament card will allow you to sign up and start your leaderboard
3569900	3572140	for a shot at these various prizes.
3572140	3574700	So it's interesting that it's all built into the system.
3575500	3578620	I don't think I'm good enough at games to get very far in any of these tournaments,
3578620	3580860	but I think it's interesting that that's all set up in there.
3580860	3585100	Plus, I don't play any of those games that were announced there, but nice to finally
3585100	3588300	have parity with something from the PlayStation 4 on the PlayStation 5.
3588300	3593660	But hopefully to the comment that Zen Monkey 11 said earlier, improving it as well is also
3593660	3594460	very important.
3595980	3600380	Also, just to follow up to something I said a minute ago, Shane's in chat, Chad Leland
3600380	3605340	saying Fuser sadly is not a physical game, so this does kill it completely.
3605340	3610460	I thought for sure I saw a physical copy of it at a store somewhere once, but I don't
3611260	3615740	am I just embarrassing, bearing, affecting myself right now?
3615740	3622540	I thought for sure I saw that at a GameStop in the Use Games section, but I guess not.
3623100	3623660	Interesting.
3624380	3626940	Not even on like, was Fuser even on the Switch?
3628540	3629340	I don't think so.
3629340	3630780	I think it was only an Epic Games store.
3631980	3632860	On PC?
3632860	3636940	Oh, well, I guess it would make sense why when you consider how it all went down with
3636940	3638060	harmonics, that's for sure.
3638940	3639820	Interesting.
3639820	3640220	I don't know.
3640220	3643580	Now I'm going to look, but we have another story to get to first, so I'm going to go
3643580	3648060	to DarkSakura, who's going to talk to us about a big event happening this week.
3649500	3650460	Indeed, indeed.
3651100	3659100	So, and we do sort of like razz it a little bit, but the Video Game Awards is actually
3659100	3662220	listening to people's feedback, and they're going to make it shorter.
3663820	3666380	It's going to be, of course, Thursday, December 8th.
3667340	3673740	And they said that basically, that they're going to make it a little bit shorter.
3673740	3675820	They won't see anything officially yet.
3675820	3677180	Actually, I'll just read the rest of the quote.
3677180	3681180	I won't see anything officially until we're through our rehearsals, but we think it's
3681180	3683980	going to be a significantly shorter show this year.
3684780	3691260	So they wanted to shorten the runtime because they think that there's fatigue in how long
3691260	3696460	the show has taken in the past, and there's lots of games and a lot of things that want
3696460	3700540	to be a part of it, but they're cutting those things out to streamline the show.
3703980	3711260	They want to highlight fewer of the newer games and just point out the really biggest
3711260	3717020	of them, and they're feeling good about this show.
3717020	3722860	I'm just wondering if it's even some feedback from developers like,
3722860	3725100	we don't want you to talk about all these other guys.
3725100	3726060	Just talk about us.
3726060	3727260	We're giving you most of the money.
3729020	3732460	I think it's probably more feedback from the people he was having to pay overtime to,
3732460	3738380	because I think last year's show went so long that I don't want to say he was in breach
3738380	3743260	of contract, but I think he had to pay extra money because they run it like a legit TV
3743260	3743740	production.
3743740	3748220	He probably was in certain clauses of union agreements in the TV industry and all that
3748220	3751020	stuff where he probably had to pay a lot of extra money because of how long that show
3751020	3751520	went.
3752060	3753660	That's likely what it boils down to to me.
3754220	3758860	Well, Tekken 8 was confirmed to be there.
3759500	3762620	There's talks about the Star Wars Jedi survivor.
3763500	3768540	Something that will not be there is anything on Mortal Kombat.
3769740	3773180	Basically, they're not going to have anything available, so we'll see.
3774300	3777900	Um, they also are mentioning in a lot, because we're still getting a lot of the...
3777900	3781820	We're on the Friends of Jeff Keighley email list or something because we've co-streamed
3781820	3782700	the Game Awards enough.
3783500	3784300	They are doing...
3786300	3788300	Now I'm like, this isn't under NDA.
3788300	3790620	They wouldn't put it in an email like that because we didn't sign anything.
3791180	3795420	There's an in-depth look at Dead Space that they're talking about doing as well.
3795420	3797660	The Dead Space remake is going to be a part of that.
3797660	3799340	So, yeah.
3799340	3804380	And Bobby and Chad is giving some more of the specifics about saying they had 56 games
3804380	3806300	last year, and this year they're going for 30 to 40.
3806300	3808220	And honestly, honestly good.
3808220	3811420	Like, not everything has to be a fucking event.
3812540	3814620	You know, I'm fine with it being a tighter show.
3814620	3816380	It did go on a little long last year.
3817900	3818540	But you know what?
3818540	3823580	I also understand completely what Zen Monkey 11 and Chad is saying, going, they should
3823580	3826060	have said, fuck the haters and made it longer.
3826060	3833580	Like, I also understand the perspective of, hey, this is like games legitimizing night
3833580	3834620	or whatever you want to call it.
3834620	3837100	This is a celebration of games and all that stuff.
3837100	3838540	I wish it wouldn't end.
3838540	3840140	I wanted to go all night long.
3840140	3844460	Now, I think because of the union contracts and the number of hours you can work and all
3844460	3849340	that stuff I just pointed out, that literally can't happen without a lot of money.
3850620	3851260	But I understand.
3851260	3853820	They do like a second show that's nothing but a showcase.
3853820	3858460	Yeah, well, summer game fest, but you know, in the winter season.
3858460	3860300	Or winter game fest too, come on.
3860300	3865180	But I also understand there is this whole, it's a yin and yang.
3865900	3871180	You have to do the premieres to get the eyes to legitimize the award show.
3871180	3876060	You have to do the award show to legitimize and get people to tune in, you know, or know
3876060	3878220	the premieres help people to tune in for the awards.
3878220	3882220	The awards help the developers and get that prestige that they want to be a part of it
3882220	3883260	and showcase their premieres.
3883260	3884380	It's a yin and yang thing.
3884380	3885900	There has to be both, period.
3886700	3892860	It's just the volume of said yin and yang needs to be rebalanced a little bit.
3892860	3896460	I think some are like maybe the things when it comes to like musical performances and
3896460	3896940	stuff.
3896940	3903420	Like I like the tradition of the orchestra doing the medley and all that, but they haven't
3903420	3906700	teased any performances this year, have they?
3907420	3908860	I don't think they really need it.
3908860	3912540	Like unless you're going to get fucking like Lady Gaga or Beyonce or somebody on that
3912540	3914860	level, like, and I love churches.
3914860	3919900	So I think perform last year, I love churches, but it just, it just makes a long show longer.
3919900	3923500	And I understand why they just need to cut it down a little bit.
3924300	3928940	S2100 Matt says a sponsor like Verizon or whoever isn't going to pay for ads at hours
3928940	3933020	three and four for a long award show because they know not a lot of folks are still tuning
3933020	3933820	in at that point.
3933820	3937660	Well, don't forget the commercials you are.
3937660	3941740	I was going to say a lot of the premieres and a lot of the things you do see in between.
3941740	3944860	There are commercials very slyly stuck in there.
3944860	3946780	Don't forget that about the game awards.
3946780	3951660	They very much put commercials that look like premieres or for things that are already out.
3952460	3954380	They very much will have that woven in there.
3954380	3956780	I guarantee it because they do everything.
3956780	3958460	Yeah, promotional spots to promote.
3959100	3960140	Absolutely.
3960140	3960780	Absolutely.
3961580	3964060	E3VL says orchestra is only good if you're live.
3964060	3964540	Well, guess what?
3964540	3965980	They're bringing it back live this year.
3965980	3971180	They were selling tickets to go to the LA event and they're doing an IMAX theater thing.
3971180	3972380	If I remember right as well.
3972380	3979500	So they're, they're, they're doing, you know, a lot of different ways to get it out there.
3979500	3983500	But anyway, I know we have some other follow ups on the game awards.
3983500	3987180	So let me get to these other stories that are some other things related to the game
3987180	3987580	awards.
3987580	3988080	Loki.
3991660	3992460	Loki, you with us?
3993420	3993740	Yeah.
3993740	3994380	Oh, no.
3995580	3997100	Other other things about the game awards.
3997980	3998480	Yeah.
3998480	4004460	Um, so there's lots of cool stuff, like including, uh, valve, giving away steam decks one per
4004460	4005180	minute.
4005180	4006620	How fancy is that?
4007180	4011980	Um, so yeah, you, I guess I'm not sure how you would do that.
4011980	4016860	I guess if you register maybe through their site, um, yeah, through valve streaming site.
4017580	4023340	Uh, so if you watch the game awards through there, then you'll have a chance to win one
4023340	4029180	per minute, which is, I think about, I think they said like almost 180 steam decks is what
4029180	4030380	they're looking to give away.
4030380	4034060	So they just told you how much shorter the show is going to be than years past.
4034060	4037580	Just, just so we're clear that valve just told you how, how much shorter they're making
4037580	4038220	the show this year.
4039900	4040540	Yeah.
4040540	4042380	So, um, pretty awesome.
4043100	4050780	And then, um, one other thing that is, or not coming is an announcement by Ed Boon.
4050780	4057020	He has said that he is, he's announced that he is not announcing anything, so it'll be
4057020	4060300	a very, I guess.
4060300	4061580	Um, cool.
4061580	4063020	I wait a little bit longer.
4063020	4064460	I believe the background on that.
4064460	4065980	Cause, uh, dark soccer referenced it too.
4065980	4072460	The background on that is, uh, that on the Xbox store, on the website, one of the two,
4072460	4076700	there was a, um, SGA 100 mat says announcement of no announcement.
4076700	4081100	There's a reason for that because on the Xbox store, there was a nether realm studios,
4081100	4083420	like listing that suddenly showed up.
4083420	4087340	And I think it had a name and it wasn't, it could have been a project name or something
4087340	4089420	because it wasn't tied to any existing IP.
4089420	4094220	But anyway, people assumed they jumped to the conclusion that Microsoft listed something
4094220	4096940	early that was supposed to be premiered at the game awards.
4096940	4100540	Uh, so this is why another realm is coming out and saying you didn't see anything.
4100540	4103020	We're not premiering anything at the game awards.
4103020	4109980	To be, to be fair, he said, no, we aren't announcing the next injustice or moral combat
4109980	4110620	next week.
4110620	4111260	Sorry.
4111260	4111820	Okay.
4111820	4112460	Okay.
4112460	4118060	So new IP, maybe, you know what?
4118060	4120700	Just fucking wait till Thursday at this point.
4120700	4121980	I'm not going to try to read the tea leaves.
4121980	4123180	I'm just going to wait till Thursday.
4123980	4131020	Um, somebody who needs to fucking do something on Thursday is Hideo Kojima.
4131020	4135820	And I fully expect we'll do something on Thursday because this tease it's, it's officially
4135820	4137180	gone on too long.
4137180	4138460	And you know what?
4138460	4143100	I don't, I know I don't get to give out game awards, but I do think there is an award that
4143100	4146460	needs to be given out every year for shit or get off the pot.
4146460	4151100	And Hideo Kojima would win it this year because there is that whole fact.
4151100	4155740	Sometimes you tease a game too much, or you tease a thing too much.
4156300	4158700	You need to shit or get off the pot.
4159660	4162780	That's what Hideo Kojima needs to do when it comes to his next project.
4163820	4169180	But in classic Hideo Kojima form, a new teaser hit his Twitter account this week that invites
4169180	4172940	viewers to start a new journey with three mysterious symbols.
4173500	4176620	Some folks are wondering, is this Death Stranding 2?
4177500	4180060	Is this the game that has Elle fanning?
4180620	4183100	Is Death Stranding 2 also a horror game?
4183100	4185500	Because that's been rumored for some time.
4185580	4191260	But there's one of the logos, the APAC, the automated public assistance company that off
4191260	4195180	that sounds like something that could be like a Death Stranding 2 type of thing.
4195180	4196140	I don't know.
4196140	4198780	This symbol was also present in the fanning teaser.
4198780	4199100	I'm sorry.
4199100	4202620	One of the other symbols is also present in the fanning teaser.
4202620	4205900	And of course we all heard about that video that leaked.
4205900	4212780	So, but whatever Kojima is working on, it is officially time for him to show it.
4212780	4217020	But now here's the good news where all this is going.
4217020	4222300	Hideo Kojima is absolutely besties with Jeff Keighley.
4222300	4226460	And if he's going to announce something, he will do it at the Game Awards.
4226460	4233420	And there probably is a nice, there's no more Elden Ring teases to be done unless there's
4233420	4235420	an Elden Ring 2, God help us all.
4235420	4239340	Actually, there's a lot of fans that game who'd really love that, but it's not happening
4239340	4239980	this year.
4239980	4240940	Not happening this year.
4241180	4244220	So what's going to take that last spot at the Game Awards?
4244780	4247180	I think Hideo Kojima, here you go.
4247180	4248300	It's go time.
4248300	4249020	Do something.
4250860	4252060	But I look forward to it.
4252060	4254860	I loved a lot of what Death Stranding was trying to do.
4254860	4259660	I maybe didn't get through the game start to finish, but I think a lot of that game really
4259660	4262140	hit hard because of when it came out.
4262140	4265980	I know Dark Sakura followed a lot of Death Stranding and a lot of like the characters
4265980	4266380	and stuff.
4266380	4267500	And you were into this too.
4268220	4273020	What are your thoughts about like a sequel possibly happening in that world?
4273580	4277500	It'll be another game to watch because I didn't play it.
4277500	4278140	I watched it.
4279660	4285580	No, but it's so either whether you're being serious or telling a joke, either applies
4285580	4286860	to be honest.
4286860	4293020	Because yeah, Death Stranding just came out on Xbox Game Pass for PC.
4293020	4294220	So I checked it out again.
4294780	4299020	And it was like an hour and a half before I actually got to move a character.
4299020	4303340	Because that is a Hideo Kojima production.
4303340	4304460	Trademark, patent pending.
4306140	4308860	Anyway, let's move on.
4309420	4311900	Something we won't see at the Game Awards, I don't think.
4311900	4312620	Dark Sakura.
4314620	4322380	Well, you know, going back to previous statements about Activision Blizzard.
4322940	4328460	And they're in office and out of office issues.
4330220	4340620	The army actually basically killed a marketing effort working with Activision Blizzard for
4340620	4346620	Call of Duty after the whole gender discrimination, sexual assault lawsuits.
4347340	4350060	It was confirmed just this past Thursday.
4350620	4357340	They had a massive marketing campaign that had Call of Duty at the core of it.
4357340	4359340	And now they're like, no.
4360380	4367020	They had a direct partnership with Activision Blizzard for sponsoring its esports team,
4367020	4368620	the Call of Duty League.
4368620	4371100	All of it's been cut off now.
4371100	4376220	And the official statement is the army has no current relationship with Activision.
4376220	4380540	The army sponsorship of Call of Duty League, produced by Activision Blizzard, was set
4380540	4382940	to expire in August of 2021.
4383740	4385100	However, in light of...
4385100	4386060	Wait, how old is this?
4387100	4387820	Okay, never mind.
4388780	4391980	I was talking about all the 2021 stuff.
4391980	4393820	It's been going on that long.
4393820	4394380	Yeah.
4394380	4399100	However, in light of the development surrounding California Department of Fair Employment and
4399100	4403820	the housing lawsuit, etc., etc., we paused activities ahead of the expiration date and
4403820	4405100	chose not to renew.
4406460	4411100	And so just go...
4411100	4420380	There's like, again, repeats of some of the bullshit from Activision's spokesperson, just
4420380	4425660	all kinds of things, but they are looking completely to make that...
4425660	4427260	Okay, I see what the issue now.
4427260	4432300	This is actually, it is an older story and I misread that, but they updated it with the
4433100	4439900	information from Activision saying that they were shocked by it.
4439900	4440400	They...
4442620	4447580	The quote is saying that no court in California found anything to substantiate, which is bullshit.
4449260	4455660	But it's just showing that we're still seeing the repercussions of it today and they need
4455660	4456700	to keep holding them accountable.
4456940	4462620	And it's also a way in which a lot of the discourse, for lack of a better term, online
4463340	4469100	led to this, where other companies don't necessarily want to be associated with it.
4469100	4471340	Look at what Twitter is going through.
4471340	4472940	I love to pick on Twitter right now.
4472940	4476620	Look at what Twitter is going through right now with advertisers and how there's many
4476620	4477100	people.
4477100	4482860	And now the current owner of Twitter wants to do the name them and shame them approach
4483660	4488620	for advertisers, because that's always worked in trying to get advertisers on board with
4488620	4490700	your platform is to pick a fight.
4490700	4491500	But I digress.
4493500	4497340	If the army really wanted to make good at it, they would be doing some cleaning in house
4497340	4498220	as well.
4498220	4500060	They're not innocent.
4501180	4504700	The army is not in the position to be playing morality police.
4504700	4505260	I get that.
4505980	4514380	And on exactly the same things, tons of people are silenced for sexual assault allegations.
4515740	4526700	What about Vanessa Guillen, who they basically found her dead in a riverbed after she had
4527820	4530940	made some complaints of sexual harassment.
4532700	4533340	Very good point.
4533340	4537180	I'm just saying we're seeing also a lot of the pot calling the kettle black.
4538620	4540380	So all right.
4541980	4547180	Well, let's move on and talk about some new information that's come out this week on another
4547180	4547500	game.
4547500	4549100	Loki, yes.
4549100	4560860	So apparently the ratings for Final Fantasy 16 have been discovered on the Brazilian game
4560860	4568380	rating board, and it kind of gives us an idea of and probably begin to be mature rated here
4568380	4569820	in North America.
4569820	4575420	But we know what their ratings are based on right now, the different criteria.
4575420	4583020	So it lists that the game will feature sex scenes, not fully shown, intentional deaths,
4584060	4590700	torture scenes depicting suffering victims, drug use, prostitution, sexual content.
4591260	4592460	And hate crimes.
4593180	4593980	Hold on.
4593980	4595660	Drug use in a Final Fantasy game?
4595660	4597580	Are we going to smoke the chocobo grass?
4597580	4601420	Is that how does drug use factor in a Final Fantasy game?
4603980	4606060	Just injecting that material, I guess.
4606060	4608300	Pestle on those geisha greens.
4609900	4615260	I'm very curious to see, are they going to stick to the only the drugs that were available
4615260	4620300	in ancient medieval times since they're trying to use that as excuse for other things?
4621260	4626140	Are we only it's only going to be 100% only going to be absent or I don't even know what
4626140	4629100	the fuck they got high off of back in those times.
4629100	4633500	They'll pick something up 100% accurate to medieval times.
4633500	4640140	Anyway, so when we say that Final Fantasy 16 is getting its influence from Game of Thrones,
4640860	4643420	we mean in every fashion.
4644780	4646220	I can't wait for the end.
4648140	4648620	Oh my God.
4648620	4649820	Is there going to be a red wedding?
4649820	4651180	See anything about incest?
4652700	4654620	There's so much.
4654620	4661340	I think Square realized maybe there were some lines they shouldn't cross, but I'm very curious
4661340	4665740	to see what Final Fantasy 16's red wedding scene is going to be.
4665740	4668620	Because now I'm you're hearing a lot.
4668620	4670700	I'm like all this Game of Thrones influence.
4670700	4673660	I'm like, there's gonna be a red wedding scene in Final Fantasy 16.
4673660	4675180	Just fucking wait for it.
4675180	4680220	As long as they actually bring her back as the undead instead of just leaving her dead.
4681020	4682300	Like she was in the book.
4682300	4682860	Just saying.
4682860	4683340	We need it.
4683340	4684860	We need more vengeful undead.
4685660	4686940	Well, we have vengeful.
4687740	4688380	What do they call?
4688380	4693100	I want to say summons, but they're called eidolons, eidolons, titans.
4693100	4694780	I don't remember what they're calling them in 16.
4694780	4697580	But you know, basically that we have those vengeful spirits.
4697580	4698700	So we'll see.
4698700	4700300	Aerith, what are you doing here?
4700300	4707740	Oh, DJ Rama says a red wedding scene done to the Final Fantasy six opera scene.
4707740	4708620	You're welcome.
4708620	4711100	Hey, you know what?
4711100	4713820	I mean, as long as it's tastefully done, I guess.
4713820	4719580	If one, if Yoshi, if Yoshi P knows how to do one thing in Final Fantasy, he knows how
4719580	4724140	to do a fucking callback to the earlier games and something they haven't tried to do in
4724140	4726860	14 yet is do the opera scene.
4726860	4729740	So you joke is just going to be just.
4730620	4734220	You, you joke Rama, but the stage is set.
4734220	4737180	My friend, the stage is set literally.
4737180	4738060	So we'll see what happens.
4738060	4740060	We'll see what happens by the way.
4740060	4744620	That's because I believe they've said that, um, now Kiyoshita is going to be at the game
4744620	4747740	awards either as a presenter or some type of fashion.
4747740	4749420	Ken and Roberta Williams are going to be there as well.
4749420	4751580	By the way, I noticed, uh, that came out too.
4751580	4757260	Now, granted, um, Ken and Roberta Williams are working on a, uh, a reboot of their very
4757260	4761660	first game for VR, uh, that all started during COVID cause they couldn't travel.
4761660	4763340	So, um, they're doing that.
4763340	4767420	So they have, but they're presenting, but now Kiyoshita is going to be there.
4767420	4769340	So I wonder why.
4769980	4770480	Hmm.
4771900	4772400	Anyway.
4773420	4773980	All right.
4773980	4780620	Uh, moving on next story, uh, for me, and it has to do with Twitch and, uh, you know,
4781580	4782380	yeah, further chat.
4782380	4786620	Well, yeah, if you're a broadcaster on Twitch, this has been like highlighted and spotlit
4786620	4788460	for you, even here on the VOG account.
4788460	4793260	When I logged in for the first time in a little bit today, uh, I got, uh, to see this and
4793260	4796460	that is the new shield mode that they have put on Twitch.
4796460	4799260	This is part of hate raid protection.
4799260	4805660	Um, now I don't, I don't want to sound naive, but I haven't seen a Twitch hate raid in a
4805660	4806460	while.
4806460	4811100	Uh, uh, I I'm hoping that means that people are losing interest in them.
4812540	4819420	A few people have, um, there's some who's reporting that people are like gifting subs
4819420	4824620	or making a sub just so that they can have a voice if they have voice to chat enabled
4824620	4830140	so that it will be like, and one of the people, um, was like, yeah, I just thanked them for
4830140	4831340	the money and then they quit.
4832380	4832860	Got it.
4832860	4835580	So people are just finding new ways to be shitty, basically.
4836220	4841980	You know what I did have been happening, but weekly, I did see that happen on somebody's
4841980	4847420	feed, but I'm at the same mindset where I'm like, you just gave them $2 and 50 cents to
4847420	4849260	be a, be a dumbling.
4849260	4850540	And then that's, that's it.
4850540	4853740	Like, I don't understand paid to be a Dick.
4853740	4855500	Yeah, it's, it's weird.
4856060	4856300	Okay.
4856300	4856540	Yeah.
4856540	4861180	And I don't, I also, I don't want to be like naive or say just because I don't see it means
4861180	4862060	it's not happening.
4862060	4865660	I just want to say I, it doesn't seem to be as widespread.
4865660	4867500	I'm not seeing the social media buzz.
4867500	4871340	I mean, granted, I'm, I'm on a site with a lot fewer people now and I used to be, but
4871340	4874860	I'm not seeing that type of buzz and that sort of thing that I was seeing months ago
4874860	4875660	with it.
4875660	4876140	A dark to see.
4876140	4878300	It does say me, she says they do happen.
4878300	4880780	She seen them on some of her favorite streamers.
4880780	4881820	Yeah, I got it.
4881820	4885980	Tiger class says $2 is chump change to them, which is why they probably did it.
4885980	4887820	Hey, actually it's $5 to them.
4887820	4891260	It's just the streamer gets two 50 and Twitch gets the other two 50.
4891260	4894380	But I digress multiple times, but I digress.
4895180	4898060	Twitch did add a shield mode this week.
4898060	4903500	It's a one button toggle and it will activate several customizable safety features all at
4903500	4909020	once you or your moderators can press it and it will limit chat to followers or subscribers,
4909020	4914780	require verification and implement stricter auto mod levels and immediately revert back
4914780	4915820	to looser policies.
4915820	4918940	Once you are in the clear and you unshield basically.
4918940	4922300	So it's literally casting a shield on your stream in many ways.
4923340	4924860	There's a pair of different defenses.
4924860	4929900	You can also automatically ban everyone who used a given phrase in chat recently.
4929900	4934700	That's nice because if people do come in spamming the same phrase, you just ban them all at
4934700	4937580	once or you can disallow first time chatters.
4938460	4939980	You can silence people with a click.
4939980	4944300	You can if you want to file reports though, you have to do that one at a time, but hopefully
4944300	4946540	that process will be streamlined in the future.
4946540	4947500	So that's pretty neat.
4948300	4948540	Yes.
4948540	4951340	There were a few things about it that kept me from enabling it though.
4953500	4956540	It wasn't tweakable enough.
4956540	4957500	Does that make sense?
4957500	4957900	Yeah, sure.
4957900	4958940	You want it a certain way.
4958940	4959440	I get it.
4960220	4960460	Yeah.
4961020	4965980	But it's nice that that's there by default for maybe the people who are newer to streaming
4965980	4969820	because for like, you know, you, me and many of our friends, we've all been streaming a
4969820	4970700	long time now.
4970700	4974220	So we all kind of came up with our own way to defend against this stuff.
4974220	4981500	But the thing we need more of on Twitch is we need to invite more people, more different
4981500	4989900	races and ethnicities, more sexualities, more women, more by gender, a gender and other
4989900	4994140	genders that are out there, more people all over all the different types of spectrums
4994140	4998300	we have in this world to be streaming on this platform.
4998300	5002700	And the nice thing is a shield is something that's there by default now so that even
5003340	5006300	somebody new to streaming can push the button if they get targeted.
5007260	5011020	Something else added on there that I heard someone mention about, but I was just checking
5011020	5015660	my creator dashboard and there's the option to stop raids for an hour.
5017020	5017740	Oh, interesting.
5018380	5019980	That you can add to your quick actions.
5020620	5024460	And I know that some people have been using it at the end of their stream so they don't
5024460	5025820	feel obligated.
5025820	5026540	If that makes sense.
5026540	5029020	Oh, that's smart.
5029020	5029580	I get it.
5029580	5030060	Yeah.
5030060	5032220	Because how much is that?
5032220	5033660	I always feel super obligated.
5033660	5034860	Yes, same.
5034860	5035900	Actually, that's legit.
5035900	5039340	I don't know about an hour, but I think like 30 minutes would be great.
5039340	5042220	Like to not allow raids because you're wrapping up.
5042780	5043660	That's smart.
5044300	5045340	But you know what?
5045340	5050620	Twitchies takes that one step further and actually tell people you're disabling raids
5050620	5054460	because you're wrapping up so that people still will try to rage you in the future.
5054460	5058140	Because I know I've tried to raid people and they have their rage just disabled.
5058140	5060860	And I go, oh, well, I guess I can't raid that person ever again.
5061420	5063900	But now that I know this is a thing, I'll keep that in mind.
5064460	5066060	So that's a pretty smart feature, though.
5067500	5067900	All right.
5068780	5069340	You know what?
5069340	5075180	We're going to go back in our next segment to a time long before we needed to shield
5075180	5075980	button on Twitch.
5075980	5076620	That's for sure.
5076620	5093340	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull
5093340	5095660	out a classic and tell you about it.
5095660	5098300	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5102220	5106060	Today's classic electronic handheld is the gaming watch.
5106620	5111420	It was designed by Gunpei Yokoi after seeing a board businessman on the Shinkansen play
5111420	5112780	with an LCD calculator.
5113420	5119180	After a meeting with Nintendo's president, Hiroshi Yamauchi and the CEO of Sharp Corporation
5119180	5121020	has given the green light to develop this concept.
5121900	5127660	Yokoi adapted the simple controls of Donkey Kong, creating a cross-shaped D-pad into the
5127660	5129340	first model to create ball.
5129900	5134220	From there, the series continued from 1980 to 1991.
5134860	5138140	The last game made for it was Mario the Juggler.
5138700	5145100	A side note, this cross-shaped D-pad created by Yokoi earned a technology and engineering
5145100	5145820	Emmy award.
5147180	5152700	There are different configurations of the gaming watch over time, including dual screen
5152700	5159100	clamshell models, the inspiration for the Game Boy Advance SP, the DS and the 3DS.
5159660	5167420	Not to mention that there were a bajillion different colors and layouts like panorama,
5167420	5172460	super color, micro versus system, crystal screen, color screen, silver, gold, you name
5172460	5172620	it.
5174780	5180540	The games themselves typically had a game A and a game B. The B version was usually
5181100	5182060	a lot harder.
5183100	5188300	There were some exceptions, like for example, the big notable ones were Judge Boxing, Donkey
5188300	5189980	Kong 3, and Donkey Kong Hockey.
5189980	5191740	The game B was a two player version.
5192780	5196860	There were 60 different game and watch games produced for sale.
5196860	5202860	There was one still for sale and one that was only available as a contest prize, making
5202860	5204300	62 total.
5204300	5211500	The prize game was given to winners of Nintendo's F1 brand pre-tournament, and it was a yellow
5211500	5216380	cased version of Super Mario Brothers that came in a plastic box modeled after Discon.
5216380	5218540	It was used to advertise the Famicom Disk System.
5219100	5224860	They only made about 10,000 units and it was never available for retail, so it's considered
5224860	5225500	pretty rare.
5227180	5231740	The Game and Watch series sold 14 million units worldwide during its first year.
5232540	5237340	The Game and Watch version of Donkey Kong released in 1982 sold 8 million units.
5237900	5242860	Mario the Juggler, which was released in 1991, was the last game created for it.
5242860	5249500	There's also a game called Headache, and it's the UK version of Helmet that's devoid
5249500	5252780	of vulgar connotations of the word in Europe.
5254220	5259420	The title is really hard to find because of region isolation, and it was released under
5259420	5265980	CGL in the UK, and it could be probably one of the rarest of the Game and Watch games.
5265980	5274060	And the one Judge in 1980 had two different color schemes, purple and green.
5276620	5285980	There were a number of re-releases between 1995 and 2002 with the Game and Watch series
5285980	5290140	after five Game and Watch collections that were released for Game Boy, Game Boy Color,
5290140	5290940	and Game Boy Advance.
5291740	5297340	They had the original ports as well as modernized versions with the Mario series cast.
5298780	5305580	1998 onward, there were third-party distributors who were licensed to release smaller LCD versions
5305580	5310380	of Game and Watch that composed the Nintendo Mini Classic series.
5311660	5318620	2001, Nintendo released Manhole E that was bundled with the E-Reader series.
5319580	5325340	And although there were a whole series of Game and Watch E-Reader cards planned, they
5325340	5326460	were never released.
5327260	5334780	Between July 2006 and March 2010, Nintendo produced two Game and Watch collector's cartridges
5334780	5339260	for the DS to be released exclusively for club Nintendo members.
5339260	5344620	The first cartridge featured three games from Game and Watch multi-screen series, which
5344620	5346700	was Oil Panic, Donkey Kong, and Greenhouse.
5347340	5354220	The second collection, too, contained Parachute, Octopus, and a Noodle Screen game with Parachute
5354220	5355660	on the top and Octopus on the bottom.
5356540	5358940	Both cartridges are now available to the public.
5359980	5367100	Between July 2009 and April 2010, they released nine separate Game and Watch ports for DSiWare,
5367100	5374700	including remakes of Ball, Flagman, Manhole, Mario's Cement Factory, and others.
5375580	5381420	In March 2010, Takara Tomy released Game and Watch keychains.
5381420	5386940	Well, style keychains, anyway, based on the widescreen versions of Octopus, Parachute,
5386940	5387440	and Chef.
5388140	5390540	They don't actually play the games, but just have a demo screen.
5391420	5394140	They're just there to be looked at.
5394940	5400140	Ball was released exclusively via club Nintendo for the 30th anniversary of Game and Watch
5400700	5402540	with the club Nintendo logo on the back.
5403180	5407260	Unlike the original, this one includes a mute switch, which is great,
5408460	5411420	for members of Japanese club Nintendo.
5411420	5415740	After the announcement November 2009, it was shipped in April 2010 to platinum members.
5416620	5422860	For members of the North American club Nintendo, it was available for 1200 coins from February
5422860	5424460	2011.
5424460	5429180	And for Europe, there were 7500 stars from November 2011.
5430140	5437260	On September 3, 2020, Nintendo announced a limited Game and Watch system that had full
5437260	5443340	NES versions of Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. Lost Levels, known as Super Mario
5443340	5448780	Bros. 2 in Japan, along with a variant of Ball with Mario's head or Luigi's head with
5448780	5451420	cheat code, replacing the original character's head.
5452700	5457820	It was named Game and Watch Super Mario Bros., released on November 13, 2020.
5458780	5464300	And this one was charged via USB-C cable instead of the button batteries.
5464940	5469340	After that, we had The Legend of Zelda on June 15, 2021.
5469340	5473420	It was released, not released, but revealed for the 35th anniversary.
5473420	5479020	We had four games, Legend of Zelda, Zelda 2, Adventures of Link, Legend of Zelda Link's
5479020	5483820	Awakening, and a variant of Vermin, with Link replacing the original character's head.
5483820	5486380	That was released on November 12, 2021.
5487340	5494780	The system itself was pretty influential over the handheld market.
5494780	5499740	Many different toy companies followed that, including Tiger Electronics with their Star
5499740	5500380	Wars games.
5501980	5507660	And each of these little units, basically, these were the precursors of Game Boy.
5509180	5513900	The cartridge system incorporated into that with the screen and everything.
5513900	5519740	Again, Yokoi's invention pretty much rendered the Game & Watch obsolete.
5521180	5526220	At any rate, there's also Game & Watch Gallery, where you can watch the games' videos.
5526220	5528220	They imitate the LCD displays.
5530140	5532860	Again, like I said, they had been re-released through DSiWare.
5533900	5537260	There's a DS release of Cooking Guide, Can't Decide What to Eat.
5537260	5541100	You can unlock both A and B versions of Chef if you use the timer function.
5541900	5546940	Nintendo Land for Wii U has a minigame called Octopus Dance based off of the game Octopus.
5547500	5553180	And Game & Wario for Wii U, which is a play of words on Game & Watch, has many different
5553180	5559500	references to the Game & Watch line, including a Virtual Game & Watch version of Puyo called
5559500	5559820	Bird.
5560620	5566140	This also led us to Mr. Game & Watch, who became a very popular Smash Brothers character.
5566940	5575900	He was redefined and redesigned to make him work in a 3D environment, but he is purely
5575900	5584540	two-dimensional and he uses the sound equivalent of the sounds from the Game & Watch games,
5584540	5585820	which you'll hear in the video.
5586460	5593340	And of course, we got the Amiibo version, where he has different versions of the character
5593340	5595580	that you can reattach for different poses.
5596140	5603580	And he can be scanned and create a personal CPU that can train and fight using artificial
5603580	5604140	intelligence.
5604940	5609500	The Amiibo is also used to unlock a cosmetic option for Super Mario Maker.
5610220	5612060	And there you go.
5612060	5613500	That is the Game & Watch.
5614140	5617500	And it's a pretty long history.
5619180	5620300	All right, there it is.
5620300	5627900	The Game & Watch, the final classic handheld of the month for this year, as I typically
5627900	5632780	do in December, because we've done a little twist on this classic game segment for quite
5632780	5633980	a while ever since.
5633980	5641020	I think the first year was, and I have to refer to our Wiki to remind me, 2017 was the
5641020	5642380	classic console of the month.
5643020	5646300	2018 was the classic peripheral of the month.
5646300	5649820	2019 was the classic 8-bit soundtrack of the month.
5650380	5653180	2020 was classic pinball of the month.
5653180	5658540	2021 was, oh, I love this one, the flag, the fucking weird arcade game, the flag of the
5658540	5658700	month.
5658700	5659580	That was actually really hard to do.
5659580	5660540	That was a lot of fun.
5660540	5661580	That was a lot of fun.
5661580	5663100	It was hard, though, to find material.
5663100	5663580	Oh, it was.
5663580	5664700	It was, but you had a good list.
5664700	5671420	And then 2022, the classic handheld electronic game of the month, starting off in January
5671420	5678860	with Tron, February with electronic football by Mattel, March with the game.com system,
5678860	5687100	April with the Puyo Lin, May with the Tamagotchi, June with the Digimon electronic handheld,
5687660	5694460	July with Bandai Terror House, August with the Cosmic 1000 Fire Away, September with
5694460	5701260	the Tommytronic 3D series, October with the Coleco tabletop arcade collection, November
5701260	5703580	with the Nelsonic game watches.
5703580	5707500	And then finally, of course, of course, you knew when the segment was announced, this
5707500	5711980	one was coming at some point, the Game & Watch, capping it off in December.
5712860	5716540	You know, I have to ask, are we and I know we've talked about it previously.
5716540	5719260	Did we decide finally on a 2023 theme?
5719260	5720940	Were we going to roll with that cage match theme?
5720940	5721820	Because I love that one.
5721820	5723340	But it's up to you, really.
5723340	5728220	I do like the cage match idea that it's going to take work.
5728220	5729500	Yeah, I think.
5730940	5735660	And part of me wants to table that for like a special thing.
5735660	5737820	Oh, like a like a bonus stream.
5737820	5742220	You know, we owe our listeners a bonus stream from a year ago still, but completely my fault.
5742220	5743980	But I love that maybe as a bonus stream.
5743980	5744540	That could be fun.
5745420	5754460	Well, and what I'm thinking about doing instead is the classic 80s toy.
5755980	5757420	Oh, interesting.
5757420	5758860	Like toy lines.
5758860	5764940	Oh, so departing the realm of video games, but maybe not because there's a lot of 80s
5764940	5767420	toys that in turn ended up influencing games.
5767980	5773420	So or, you know, on the same same thing I could do.
5776380	5779900	No, no, I'm trying to think of like specific.
5781340	5785900	My thought is board game or card game, because there's a lot of that stuff that comes over.
5785900	5786620	But I don't know.
5786620	5787180	It's up to you.
5787180	5791820	There's some that have just been like classics already, you know, that were out before then,
5791820	5794460	like the original Cluedo, for example.
5794780	5795280	Sure.
5795660	5803020	You know, going back to old battleship, you know, I could maybe I could do very specifically
5804620	5808060	games from the 80s, like physical games.
5809100	5810140	You know what that means, though?
5811740	5812540	Crossfire.
5813580	5815100	All right, well, I'll let you marinate on it.
5815100	5816700	Don't don't finalize.
5816700	5818220	No, I'm going to do that.
5818220	5820380	Do you do 80s board games?
5822140	5824300	Board games are interactive games.
5824300	5826700	Competitive games and no magic.
5827980	5831180	Magic, I think was 89 card games are not going to go into it.
5831180	5831680	Okay.
5832380	5832880	All right.
5833180	5833740	That's it.
5833740	5834220	That's it.
5834220	5836300	So put it on the wiki.
5836300	5836940	It's coming up.
5836940	5838940	Now I got to watch all this crossfire commercials.
5838940	5839440	Yeah.
5839500	5840000	All right.
5841180	5846060	All right, let's move around the industry quickly at a rapid pace and talk about what
5846060	5848620	else is going on in rapid fire news.
5848620	5849420	We'll start with Loki.
5850300	5855500	So Fortnite chapter three has just ended, and now we have the tease for chapter four.
5856060	5859500	And we know some of the things that are going to be coming into that as well.
5860380	5864220	First off, they're going to be updating the graphics of the game.
5864220	5867980	It's going to be running on unreal 5.1, which looks pretty awesome.
5868540	5874780	And then along with that, though, we have teases for Doom guy, Gerald from the Witcher
5874780	5888300	series, and Azuki Midoriya, I don't know why I couldn't say that from what was that?
5888300	5890140	It was My Hero Academia.
5890780	5898380	And also, I believe there was cameos, at least as part of the cut scene from chapter three
5898380	5899660	of Hulk.
5899660	5902940	And then also there's dirt bikes in there now.
5902940	5904060	And Mr. Beast.
5904620	5908300	It's just an amalgamation of like all sorts of weird stuff.
5909020	5915500	It's like the multi or like it's like Ready Player One almost at this point, kind of.
5917420	5918860	And then this is kind of funny.
5918860	5922540	So Uncharted is getting a roller coaster.
5923180	5923820	That's right.
5923820	5926940	It's not coming to a park, at least near me.
5926940	5937580	But in, I guess, Port Aventura world, they're going to be getting a ride based off of Uncharted
5938140	5939820	and that's going to be in Spain.
5939820	5944700	It's their largest theme park there, and it's coming out middle of next year.
5946540	5949900	And apparently it's a dark ride roller coaster.
5949900	5951580	Well, it sounds like fun fun.
5951580	5955500	Oh, yeah, that makes me think of like the mummy at Universal.
5955500	5957260	Hollywood is a dark ride roller coaster.
5957260	5958060	That's a lot of fun.
5958860	5959360	Yeah.
5959900	5963340	I'll never forget the first time I rode that ride with Exeter, and we had no idea what
5963340	5965500	to expect when the thing started going backwards.
5965500	5970300	We screamed so loud that like we were crying, but it was a lot of fun.
5970300	5972460	Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
5974140	5974940	A couple of things.
5974940	5981260	There is a second closed beta announced for Street Fighter 6.
5982380	5985580	They've done some tweaking to some of the characters.
5986460	5991580	Actually, they've done quite a bit of bug fixes on it, balance adjustments.
5993740	5997580	And they also have put in the Avatar creation.
5998620	6003900	You can't save or load recipes for them or remake them during the beta, but you can make
6003900	6004400	them.
6004780	6009660	There's different features like cross-platform play, different control types, commentary,
6009660	6018060	all of that was there and commentary by characters in the game.
6018060	6027420	I think like different people like Vicious Tasty Steve Aru, Kosuke Hidaiwa, and other
6027420	6027920	people.
6028560	6032640	Then there are different stages playable.
6032640	6040560	Metro City, Genbu Temple, Carrier, Byron Taylor, Chun Hong Yuan, the macho ring in the training
6040560	6047120	room, and different game center challenges, different battles, different modes, all kinds
6047120	6047620	of stuff.
6047620	6053280	So it looks like it's going to be just a big push over the last one.
6053280	6056160	I had a lot of fun playing this at TwitchCon.
6057040	6061200	So I'd like to get in on it.
6061200	6065840	I don't know if I can do it, but it is open for Steam players as well.
6065840	6069200	Xbox 5, Xbox Series, and Steam.
6070320	6070800	You know what?
6070800	6074400	Capcom specifically needs somebody to test this whole Boosteroid thing.
6074400	6076400	So I think you should write him an email.
6077520	6078020	Yeah.
6078560	6079060	All right.
6079600	6084080	Well, if I could, I've been having some issues getting some stuff to play on Boosteroid.
6084080	6084800	Oh, no.
6085520	6086020	All right.
6087040	6087540	All right.
6088720	6091360	Moving on to what is going on in PlayStation Plus.
6092080	6096640	December's monthly games have been announced, and an OLR Fave is a part of it.
6096640	6099120	Actually, a whole OLR Fave trilogy is a part of it.
6100000	6105360	These titles available from December 6 to January 2, including Mass Effect Legendary
6105360	6105840	Edition.
6105840	6106400	That's right.
6106400	6111440	If you want to play the original trilogy, but all the DLC included, the all-in-one,
6111440	6115280	optimized for 4K, all the things, that is available now.
6115280	6116400	So check that out.
6116400	6122160	You can also check out on PlayStation 5 slash PlayStation 4 Divine Knockouts Founders Edition
6122160	6124720	that is launching, they say, directly into PlayStation Plus.
6125360	6127760	You know, Rocket League got its start that way.
6127760	6129680	So sometimes some big games come out of that.
6129680	6134400	And then Biomutant, part melee shooting and mutant ability action.
6134400	6139440	It's an open world RPG that is available on PS5 and PS4.
6139440	6142560	So those are your free PS Plus games.
6142560	6143200	Go grab them.
6143920	6147040	If you're an Xbox person, I don't have the games.
6147040	6150560	I think we talked about it last week, what's coming out for games with gold.
6150560	6155520	But I can tell you what's coming to Game Pass, which is available, which I saw a long time
6155520	6160560	listener, Dark Tetsuya, and I, we talked a little bit on Mastodon, and Dark Tetsuya talked
6160560	6162640	about that they got an Xbox Series S.
6163600	6164880	And so I think that's pretty cool.
6164880	6168400	So they were like, I know him and Mish were like, what game should we get?
6168400	6170800	And I was like, honestly, if you can afford it, just get Game Pass.
6172640	6176160	So Dark Tetsuya, Mish, and everyone else with an Xbox.
6176160	6178320	Here are some of the things coming out for Game Pass.
6178320	6181600	Eastward is coming to Cloud, Console, and PC.
6181600	6186640	The Walking Dead, The Final Season, and Total Reliable Delivery Service.
6186640	6188080	Those just came out.
6188080	6191840	On December the 6th, LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga.
6191840	6193040	Hello Neighbor 2.
6193040	6194880	That is actually a day one release.
6194880	6198400	December 8th, Seized Chained Echoes and Metal Hellsinger.
6198400	6201600	December 13th, High on Life and Potioncraft.
6202160	6206160	December 15th, Hot Wheels Unleashed Game of the Year Edition and Rainbow Billy, The Curse
6206160	6206960	of the Leviathan.
6207520	6211120	And yeah, those are all coming out real soon.
6211120	6213360	So check that out if you're an Xbox Game Pass person.
6214400	6214720	All right.
6215360	6218240	Meanwhile, let's check out what's coming out to the retail shelves.
6218240	6222080	I don't think this is a busy time of year for retail, but sometimes we're surprised.
6222080	6224560	So let's travel around and check out some release dates.
6224880	6226160	Loki, how about the US?
6226160	6233280	Yeah, we have Hello Neighbor 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6234160	6238880	Chained Echoes on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6240800	6246800	Idol, Gen Z, Sushi, Pi, Saturn, and Tribute on Nintendo Switch.
6247760	6254160	The Rumble Fish 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and
6254160	6255040	Xbox Series.
6256000	6261440	Samurai Maiden on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
6262480	6266560	We have Sukai Tenki on Nintendo Switch.
6267360	6272400	Witch on the Holy Knight, that's on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
6273440	6279600	Adventure Academia, The Fractured Continent on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.
6280240	6287120	Chuchu Charles on PC, and Dragon Quest Treasures on Nintendo Switch.
6287120	6287600	That's it.
6288320	6289120	All right.
6289120	6290240	Traveling over to Japan.
6290880	6293760	It's a pretty busy week still on the Nintendo Switch over in Japan.
6293760	6296560	Witch on the Holy Knight is released in a regular and limited edition.
6296560	6299600	Those are coming out in English, but it is a Japanese release.
6299600	6304400	That's Sukai Tenki that Loki mentioned is also out in a regular and special edition
6304400	6305840	on Japan this week.
6305840	6310720	Idol, Janshi, Sushi, Pi, Saturn, Tribute is out in regular and limited edition as well.
6311680	6314800	It Takes Two gets a release on the Switch in Japan.
6314800	6317360	That was a big game at last year's Game Awards.
6317360	6320880	So if you want to check that out in Japan, that is out on the Switch this week on December
6320880	6321520	the 8th.
6321520	6326560	Atlee, Ariza 1 and 2, a double pack is out on the Switch this week.
6326560	6330720	The Rumble Fish 2 is out in English, but it is being released in Japan this week.
6330720	6334800	Dragon Quest Treasures is also out a little later in the week on the 9th.
6335440	6341360	But then Kanken Smart Taisaku and Aiken Smart Taisaku are both out on the 8th.
6342800	6347920	On the PlayStation 5, I don't think we have a lot this week in Japan.
6347920	6352000	They're just there is a Pulse 3D wireless headset that's coming out in Japan.
6352000	6354400	I think that is a third party headset.
6354400	6358000	And then other than that, really Far Cry 6 gets the Gold Edition release.
6358000	6360480	I think that's just a repackaging of a prior release.
6360480	6363840	But that is also out on the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan.
6364880	6366480	Dark Sakura, what's going on in the UK?
6368640	6373920	In that, what we have is on the 6th, Hello Neighbor 2 for PlayStation.
6374960	6379280	Also on the 6th for PlayStation, Xbox Five Nights at Freddy's Collector's Edition.
6380960	6384400	Cuckoo's Lost Pets on those and the Switch.
6384400	6388560	Also for the three of them, we have Redout 2.
6388560	6391440	We have, it looks like a big Cuphead collection.
6392080	6396320	On the 8th, we have My Universe, My Baby Dragon for Switch.
6396320	6399120	On the 9th, Dragon Quest Treasures, also for Switch.
6400560	6407360	For Switch and PlayStation on the 9th, we have Adventure Academia, the Fractured Continent.
6408880	6412240	I'm sorry, since you said My Baby Dragon, now all I hear in my head,
6412240	6415040	now who that is, My Baby Dragon, now who that is.
6415040	6415760	All right, forget it.
6416480	6418560	I was thinking of like the Baby Monkey song.
6419520	6421760	Baby Monkey, Baby Monkey.
6422640	6426640	Baby Dragon, doo doo doo doo doo, Baby Dragon.
6426640	6427680	No, I don't know.
6427680	6429280	I don't know the song.
6430640	6435840	Can you believe I have made it this long with not really hearing the whole song?
6435840	6436640	Really?
6436640	6439280	That's, do you think you'll win Whamageddon as well?
6440240	6444800	No, I lost Whamageddon already and thanks to Nick, I lost the Mariah apocalypse.
6446240	6447920	I don't mind the Wham song.
6447920	6453760	I like the Wham song and I like the Paul McCartney one, even though it's really kind of weird.
6455120	6459200	But I loathe the Mariah Carey song.
6461040	6461680	Oh, I don't know.
6461680	6464000	Your voice actually kind of annoys me.
6464000	6468400	I don't know if I'm technically winning that or not because I haven't heard either one yet.
6468400	6473840	Well, technically I haven't heard both of them, but I did hear when I was picking up
6473840	6475120	high the other day.
6475120	6480800	I heard a cover of the Mariah Carey song, which I didn't realize there was a cover of
6480800	6482080	that, but I heard that.
6482080	6484480	So I don't know if that counts or not.
6485120	6490720	I made it through the Mariah apocalypse for four years until someone finally got me with
6490720	6491220	it.
6492160	6494160	And that was actually last year and it was dro.
6494160	6498640	Honestly, look, they, they ought to add Kate Bush to the list and I love Kate Bush, but
6498640	6502560	man, ever since that four seasons Stranger Things came out, you cannot do a trip to the
6502560	6507440	mall and not here running up that Hill anymore.
6508560	6509120	I guess.
6509120	6510480	I guess I'm the weird one.
6510480	6510800	All right.
6510800	6513120	I still think malls are fun, even if they're empty.
6513680	6514180	All right.
6514880	6518160	Honestly, I need to go to a Sephora soon.
6518960	6520800	Go check out round one at the Galleria too.
6520800	6521760	It's a lot of fun.
6521760	6523120	Well, I don't want to go by myself.
6523120	6523840	I'll come.
6523840	6524400	Just tell me one.
6524400	6524880	Okay.
6524880	6525380	All right.
6526400	6530240	Sj 100 Matt with a very good point in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
6530800	6534160	Loki talks about pie, but he doesn't say what pie he got.
6535840	6538720	I didn't get pie for me because I don't like pie.
6538720	6541120	I got a pumpkin pie for my wife.
6541120	6544000	Oh, that's like several weeks ago.
6544000	6547120	You, you bought the pie and you didn't even eat the pie.
6547120	6547760	That's love.
6548320	6548800	That's love.
6548800	6549040	All right.
6549040	6549920	I don't like pie.
6549920	6551840	So it's easy thing for me to do.
6551840	6554000	That's so say this in Alabama.
6554000	6555760	I did have some good sweet potato pie.
6555760	6562080	Pumpkin pie is one of those things that like, you know, ever since my diagnosis, it's like
6562080	6565200	the one thing I allow myself as a special treat like once a year.
6565200	6567840	So it's a big ever had sweet potato pie, Rob.
6567840	6568640	Oh, I have.
6568640	6569280	Yeah, of course I have.
6569280	6573920	I've had sweet potato sweet potato is, is far superior to the pumpkin.
6573920	6575680	Oh, well on that you're wrong, but that's okay.
6575680	6577280	Everybody has their own opinion.
6577280	6581920	I am absolutely 1000% correct.
6581920	6582400	Correct.
6583200	6583600	All right.
6583600	6585840	Look one thing we can agree on.
6585840	6586880	Did you do the UK dates?
6586880	6587680	You did the UK date.
6587680	6587920	Sorry.
6587920	6588080	Yes.
6588080	6589520	Cause I was making fun of baby dragon.
6589520	6589760	All right.
6591280	6594960	One thing we can agree on is that Yuzo Koshiro is awesome.
6594960	6598960	And so Loki, what is our next story involving Yuzo Koshiro?
6599600	6608080	Yuzo Koshiro is developing or at least working on a brand new mega drive and Genesis game.
6608080	6610560	It looks to be a side scroller shmup.
6611360	6614800	And along the lines of like a Gradius or something like that.
6615520	6616400	It's awesome.
6616400	6621200	There's not much that we know about it yet, but there's different ideas that he's been
6621200	6625520	floating around basically saying that maybe they'll sell physical cards for it.
6626800	6631200	It's like a whole Twitter thread about it, but yeah, I mean, it sounds cool.
6631200	6632560	Sounds like he's excited about it.
6633200	6635840	I'm excited to hear about whatever this is.
6636480	6640080	Um, you're, you're, you're probably let's, let's be real.
6640080	6643760	Yuzo Koshiro is probably making one of these so we can get bought for inclusion on the
6644320	6647760	Genesis mega drive three mini when it comes out inevitably.
6648640	6649920	Cause it sounds like the type of thing.
6649920	6650720	I hope it's in there.
6650720	6652240	Yeah, that'd be good.
6653840	6654480	S2100.
6654480	6658400	Matt on a, on the pie topic asks, have you had keto pumpkin pies, Rob?
6658400	6659600	Curious if those are actually good.
6659600	6660800	I have not made one.
6662000	6662720	Are they good?
6662720	6663280	I don't.
6663280	6664960	A lot of mine was really delicious.
6664960	6667520	A lot of the sugar free or whatever they do to it.
6667520	6669200	Substitutes can be kind of meh.
6669200	6669680	I don't know.
6669680	6673760	Sometimes, sometimes even with keto though, they mix a little sugar with the sweetener
6673760	6676320	stuff and it goes along with mine was all Splenda.
6676320	6676820	Okay.
6677360	6683920	And my crust was, um, crushed walnuts and, and butter.
6684960	6685600	Okay.
6685600	6691120	So it stuck to the thing and you got the, the texture, but it was, it was really, really good.
6691120	6691920	That makes sense.
6691920	6694320	Flipping out the crust like that probably goes a long way.
6694320	6695840	So, but you know what?
6695840	6697440	I can have the real thing in moderation.
6697440	6699040	I'm still doing very well with all that.
6699040	6703360	So, you know, it is, you know, I, I, if you don't allow yourself a little cheat here and
6703360	6704880	there, you'll fall off the wagon hard.
6704880	6708400	So a little cheat here and there is how I avoid falling off the wagon hard.
6709200	6709520	All right.
6710560	6711280	Moving on.
6711280	6712960	I think we're to dark Sakura.
6712960	6714480	Ooh, this, I love this story though.
6716240	6723120	Well, I have to say I actually got myself caught up in a little bit of, uh, uh, a rabbit hole.
6723120	6727280	So I'm going to get right back to that because I was looking up, um, board games.
6729120	6733920	Um, which by the way, I've solidified my idea and I have just about everything except for
6733920	6735280	one month already lined up.
6737520	6745440	Anyway, so our Google doodle, uh, very recently honored the man, the legend, Jerry Lawson.
6746000	6755120	And Jerry Lawson, you know, for people I have to remind was, are basically the person that
6755120	6761040	gave us the interchangeable video game cartridge gaming system and created his own company
6761040	6764000	called video soft in the early 1980s.
6764000	6770320	And that company became one of the earliest, uh, black owned video game development companies,
6770320	6771280	according to Google.
6772000	6780000	Um, and his children, um, Anderson and Karen said that he loved what he did and he did
6780000	6780640	what he loved.
6781760	6787760	And they thought that his achievements were quite remarkable given, you know, the way
6787760	6789840	things were in, sorry for the noise.
6789840	6790560	Sorry for the noise.
6790560	6792560	I actually brought up the doodle to play a little bit.
6793120	6795600	Oh, I didn't hear anything in early eighties.
6796320	6804960	Um, but, uh, also, um, he did die in 2011, but that same year he was recognized by the
6804960	6808720	international game developers association as an industry trailblazer.
6809360	6814720	And his achievements have also been memorialized at the world video game hall of fame in New
6814720	6815040	York.
6815840	6820800	Uh, his children say that they wanted to thank Google for working with them to share, uh,
6820800	6826080	his story in a doodle, which is a game by the way, and said, may his story continue
6826080	6830560	to inspire numerous young people around the globe to achieve something remarkable.
6835040	6836160	It was a great tribute.
6836160	6836880	I loved it.
6836880	6837440	Yeah.
6837440	6838640	So it's nice.
6838640	6844880	And remember next time you, you know, dust off the, the nest or even put in, you know,
6844880	6850160	of a game desk, all that is because of this man.
6851680	6852320	Well said.
6852320	6856960	I'm glad, I'm glad history is remembering him a lot better than it used to.
6856960	6858880	So cool at Google to do that.
6859920	6863280	All right, moving on a few more stories for you, and then we'll get to our listener round
6863280	6866560	table where we invite your calls over at twitch.tv.
6866560	6867040	Excuse me.
6867040	6871440	Well, you can also, uh, chat along with us at twitch.tv slash vog network, but if you
6871440	6875120	want to call us, you got to go to discord vog network.com slash discord.
6875120	6877280	That's VOG network.com slash discord.
6877280	6881680	And you want to join our green room and the green room is how we will bring you on the
6881680	6883120	air to chat with us.
6883120	6887440	So, uh, we will get to that in a moment for now though, we have a couple more stories
6887440	6889200	for you starting with Loki.
6890080	6890320	Yeah.
6890320	6896480	So apparently it's been revealed that from software engages in some level of crunch,
6896480	6902880	according to some, uh, anonymous sources from, uh, different employees within the company.
6903760	6906400	And this is through a game industry biz.
6906400	6909840	They kind of interviewed some of these about different things that they encounter while
6909840	6910480	working there.
6911040	6916240	Um, one said, you know, during critical periods of game releases, I often had to work early
6916240	6918480	mornings and overtime for two to three months.
6919360	6925840	Um, another one said if it's, if it's not as if crunch happens on a daily basis,
6926560	6936800	um, it's not excessive over time, but it's, it's so called, uh, for during the, um, I
6936800	6940320	guess, uh, during some of the parts of the release.
6940320	6947200	So, um, I, they were also talking about their salary as well.
6947200	6953840	Um, that, uh, basically it's generally included in the salary, uh, regarding the compensation
6953840	6958480	they get for crunch, but that the compensation was not necessarily adequate for some.
6959200	6964720	And, um, didn't appear that from software didn't appear dissatisfied with their salaries
6964720	6965200	either.
6965200	6965440	Okay.
6965440	6966800	We'll give them more money.
6966800	6975600	I mean, um, but yeah, so, uh, that they're still struggling to get things right.
6975600	6978560	But if you get over the bump, it's very satisfying.
6978560	6982240	Just like defeat of Boston, dark souls said one employee.
6982240	6987040	So, I mean, I understand it crutch sucks.
6987920	6993680	Um, I know that a lot of companies still do that, but I mean, as long as they're not doing
6993680	6999040	it in a whole ton, I still like the idea that they are doing it at all, you know, pace your
6999040	7004880	games a little bit better, but at least it's not all the time, at least they're honest
7004880	7005520	about it too.
7005520	7009520	I mean, it doesn't excuse it, but at least the employees are honest about it.
7009520	7016160	I mean, because, you know, uh, and they have to be anonymous about it, but yeah, the truth
7016160	7017120	always comes out eventually.
7017120	7017360	Right.
7018080	7018720	Exactly.
7018720	7019040	Yeah.
7020320	7020720	All right.
7021680	7024240	This last story tonight, this actually came from discord.
7024240	7028560	So SSJ 100, Matt actually submitted this on discord and it was too good to not have as
7028560	7030080	a final story for tonight.
7030080	7034880	And it is about a brand new console that's coming out, but it's, um, not exactly.
7034880	7037440	Why would we put a console in the last spot?
7037440	7038960	It's not a console for humans.
7039600	7043760	It's the Joypah, which is a console that is for dogs.
7044320	7049760	And yes, it is a console that is designed for dogs to play games designed to provide
7049760	7052400	physical and mental stimulation for dogs.
7053040	7057680	It was initially conceived as a means of alleviating, alleviating boredom and separation
7057680	7060480	anxiety for a puppy when it's home alone.
7060480	7065040	But Joypah says the console has a potential to offer cognitive benefits for dogs could
7065040	7069440	also help onset the, uh, or excuse me, help delay the onset of canine dementia.
7069440	7072640	A lot of the same benefits they talk about in humans as well, which is interesting.
7073200	7074080	Why is it going to be dogs?
7075120	7076000	Uh, yeah, I know.
7076000	7076320	Right.
7076320	7079920	I'm, I'm hoping for the Meowpah or something to come after, but we'll see.
7079920	7085680	Anyway, a dog would use their, a dog will use their nose to play on the console's touch
7085680	7090800	screen and will be rewarded for correct choices via a treat dispenser.
7090800	7093600	As Joe and her mat is saying, it can be adapted for cats.
7093600	7094560	Well, that'd be cute.
7094560	7096800	Uh, Joypah games, including whack-a-mole challenge.
7096800	7097760	I know cats won't care.
7098320	7102960	Although if you, if you put like an iPad down, cause I remember there was an iPad cat thing
7102960	7104720	and a cat just basically scratches at the screen.
7104720	7107440	That's, that's basically all that like meow mix or something did that.
7107440	7108240	I don't know.
7108240	7112400	Anyway, we don't know when this is coming out, uh, but you will be able to put, you
7112400	7117920	can get one now if you put down a re uh, fully refundable deposit of $6.
7117920	7121120	And that means you get a 5% discount on the final purchase price.
7121120	7122960	How nice, how nice is that?
7122960	7126960	And by the way, speaking of how nice I actually have just for the folks that are watching
7126960	7130880	live, I have a little video of, uh, this in action.
7130880	7134800	And for those, uh, that, um, are listening on the podcast feed, you see a good little
7134800	7135680	dog there.
7135680	7140880	Who's, uh, looking at some moles on the screen and actually tapping the moles with his nose.
7141520	7145520	And you see the owner is trying to like show the dog what to do, but the dog's like, I
7145520	7146240	just want a treat.
7146800	7147920	I just want a treat.
7147920	7152720	And so the dog taps the little whack-a-mole thing and eventually gets a treat.
7152720	7156880	I don't think that dog really wanted a treat, but, um, treats, treats are available.
7156880	7158160	That is a very pretty dog.
7158160	7159920	My goodness, my goodness.
7159920	7161200	Anyway, there you go.
7161200	7162160	That's the joy paw.
7165200	7166800	It looks like it would be cute for dogs.
7168160	7172320	I just hope they don't make the games too violent or with too much sexual content, you
7172320	7175280	know, like that's, that's a real problem in the industry.
7175280	7177680	And I just don't think we need to be subjecting the dogs to that.
7177680	7182000	I, I really hope that they, you know, consider some of that with, uh, the game making.
7183520	7187200	Um, uh, I can't see it comes up with some other names for this.
7187200	7190880	Paw station, Wolf Tendo, Skinner Barks.
7190880	7193440	I think that's supposed to be like X-Box because there's an X in that.
7193440	7197520	Anyway, uh, dark tissue says rated E for every dog or cat.
7198240	7203040	Uh, Zen monkey says people are going to love it until their dogs start jumping and knocking
7203040	7204000	over the TV.
7207040	7208720	Oh, the truth of that comment.
7208720	7210880	The truth that be very careful with your setup.
7210880	7211520	That's for sure.
7212160	7212640	All right.
7212960	7217600	Let's get to the listener round table where we invite you to participate with our show.
7217600	7222000	Uh, you can send us an email every week and participate at orange lounge, radio.com.
7222000	7223440	I don't think we got anything this week.
7223440	7225920	Sadly, did we?
7225920	7226560	No, I see that.
7226560	7228880	I see the, the, the reverse notters.
7228880	7232880	So, uh, we did not get any emails this week, but participate at orange on radio.com.
7232880	7234240	If you want to send it for a future week.
7234240	7238800	However, we also take calls here on this program via our discord server.
7238800	7241120	And if you want to call into the show, you can go over to the green room.
7241120	7243040	We actually have somebody on the line.
7243040	7245600	So let's bring them in and have a chat.
7246240	7246640	Hello.
7246640	7248000	You're on orange launch radio.
7248000	7248480	Who's this?
7251760	7252080	Hi there.
7252080	7254160	I don't know if you can hear me, but you're on orange launch radio.
7254160	7254560	Who's this?
7255200	7256160	Oh, can you guys hear me?
7256160	7256880	Yes, we can.
7256880	7257360	Hi there.
7258400	7259600	Hey, I'm AJ twist.
7259600	7261120	Hey, I recognize the name.
7261120	7261680	How are you?
7262560	7264000	Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.
7264000	7268560	I haven't called in a long time, but I've been listening to you guys for forever for
7268560	7269280	years now.
7269280	7269680	Thank you.
7269680	7270640	I appreciate that.
7271360	7272960	I'm a podcast listener.
7272960	7274800	Well, I'm so glad you could join us live tonight.
7278080	7280400	I wanted to talk about the Smash world tour.
7280400	7281600	Oh, please do.
7281600	7283760	Because can you make any sense of this?
7283760	7288160	Because this is worse than an episode of Jerry Springer, to be quite honest, with all the
7288160	7289600	he said, she said.
7290240	7290960	What's going on?
7292560	7292880	Yeah.
7292880	7295520	Well, just give you a little bit of background myself real quick, too.
7295520	7299280	I've been playing Smash for years, probably a little longer than I've been listening to
7299280	7299680	you guys.
7300640	7301920	And I got a tournament.
7303040	7307840	I've gone to evil over 10 times by now over since like 2004.
7308560	7310880	So I've been following the scene for a long time.
7311760	7316800	And the Smash community itself, just fighting games in general, is all grassroots.
7316800	7322160	So it's kind of scary to hold tournaments sometimes with the fear of the companies shutting
7322160	7327120	us down, which is definitely happened with Smash Brothers, probably more than what we
7327120	7329360	know from what I've heard in the past.
7330560	7333680	And then what was going on recently with the whole Smash world tour?
7333680	7336400	They're actually, I think they were hosted by Panda Global.
7336400	7340080	So Panda Global and Nintendo teamed up to do the Smash world tour.
7341360	7346320	And then what was going on behind the scenes, the CEO of Panda Global, I think his name
7346320	7348640	was like Alan Allen something, I think is what his name was.
7349200	7354240	Supposedly, he was going around to other tournament organizers and telling them that they should
7354320	7359120	sign up under Panda to do their tournaments, because if they don't, Nintendo is going to
7359120	7361040	come through and shut them down.
7361040	7366800	So he was talking to all these organizers, scaring them into signing up under his whole
7366800	7367300	thing.
7367840	7371200	And I think Nintendo heard about that and got involved.
7372400	7378880	But on top of that, Nintendo is just, I don't know, they don't love their fans or something.
7379280	7385600	Every time there's an event and they say they're okay with it, they end up turning around
7385600	7387680	sometimes and being like, no, we're not okay with this.
7389120	7395440	Something else like referring back to EVO 2013, where EVO almost had to take down Smash
7395440	7397040	Brothers because of Nintendo.
7397040	7402640	What happened back then supposedly too was, you know, Nintendo got word that Smash was
7402640	7403440	happening at EVO.
7403440	7405280	They're like, no, no, no, we need to stop this.
7405280	7408960	And then within hours, I think they're like, you know, backed off like, no, never mind,
7408960	7409440	you're all good.
7409440	7410240	Go ahead and stream it.
7410880	7415920	But supposedly what happened was it was the marketing department that was the one that
7415920	7421360	wanted to shut down Smash Brothers that year, because that year was the same year that they
7421360	7425920	were to announce Smash, I don't know, Smash 4 or whatever game was coming out that year.
7425920	7431360	And so then he wants people to go look at the old game when there's a new game coming
7431360	7431860	out.
7432400	7434080	So there's that whole thing too.
7434080	7436000	So I feel like Nintendo, go ahead.
7436000	7440160	Well, no, I was just saying, it's interesting to me because I get the sense that like Nintendo
7440800	7443680	seems to have like a working in silos type of problem.
7443680	7446560	And I don't know if that's between the different departments, kind of like you illustrate there
7446560	7449840	with the marketing department wants to do one thing, but the PR department wants to do
7449840	7450560	another.
7450560	7452000	Japan wants to do one thing.
7452000	7453360	The US wants to do another.
7453360	7458240	Like Nintendo has a serious communication problem within themselves that I think is
7458240	7459760	really showing in this story.
7460720	7461200	Exactly.
7461200	7462400	That's what I was thinking too.
7462400	7465760	It's like they're an octopus and one hand isn't talking to the other hand, it's not
7465760	7467440	talking to the other hand, that's like the other hand.
7467440	7469840	So they're all over the place sometimes, I think is what it is too.
7470960	7474080	I think what ended up happening with that whole marketing department thing, almost shutting
7474080	7480560	people down that year, was that it was supposedly a rumor that the wife of one of the head CEOs
7480560	7482800	over there, you know, was like following this.
7482800	7484720	And she's like, no, wait, you guys stop it.
7484720	7485840	You know, this is a good thing.
7485840	7487280	And then, you know, they turned it around.
7488080	7490560	But yeah, but that's a whole crazy thing.
7490560	7494960	And that's kind of like, you know, my, my, you know, news or what I can give you about
7494960	7497360	this whole Smash World Tour thing, what's going on.
7497360	7501280	And now the whole Smash community is kind of scared now because Nintendo is talking
7501280	7506480	about licenses and, but they're like, but you guys could do your tournaments, but like,
7506480	7509680	but you might want a license because if you don't have one, we're going to shut you down.
7509680	7513840	But at the same time, the World Tour, Panda Global had a license and they still shut it
7513840	7514080	down.
7514080	7515280	So I was like, are we safe?
7515280	7516080	Are we not safe?
7516080	7517680	Like, you know, what should we do?
7517760	7521840	Because, yeah, because they're, they're not able to, Nintendo's not able to communicate
7521840	7523440	with itself, which is ridiculous.
7523440	7528960	It's just, it's, it's, Nintendo needs to have probably some type of written sort of policy
7528960	7532800	with this, or at least I imagine they probably do, but they're not enforcing it consistently.
7532800	7537280	It's just, or I also, I'm also reminding you, Loki, you got into this last week when this
7537280	7542000	whole thing kind of first came up is that you were talking about, it's reminiscent of
7542000	7543840	Nintendo's YouTube policy.
7543840	7546960	Remember when they were like, if you want to, if you want to show a Nintendo game on
7546960	7550640	YouTube, you got to be through our creator program and we get 30%.
7550640	7557200	And it's like, you can't, you can't, Nintendo does not have the muscle to police that.
7557200	7560080	They just, it's a good thing that their games are good.
7560080	7564640	Cause if they weren't, I mean, their community building is not great.
7564640	7569120	I know they really let rest on how strong some of those games resonate with people.
7569120	7573680	Well, let me ask you this, AG twist, because you are, you said you've been with the smash
7573680	7575520	scene a long time.
7575520	7577360	How does this make you feel as a fan?
7577360	7579680	Like, are you still an avid fan of smash?
7579680	7583840	Cause you just kind of look past all this or are you like, dang, maybe, maybe it's time
7583840	7585200	to pick up Tekken.
7585200	7588000	Like, I don't know, like what, where do you come from as a fan?
7589200	7592560	Actually, I play more Tekken than smash, honestly, as of lately.
7595680	7598080	How much of that is because of this bullshit?
7599440	7600480	That's a good question.
7600480	7606880	I don't know, those are my friends, honestly, but I would like to participate in more smash
7606880	7607680	tournaments and stuff.
7607680	7611680	Just being older now, I don't really have the time, but I still try to support when
7611680	7616720	I can maybe join a tournament when I'm able to definitely watch some of the Twitch streams
7616720	7617920	and stuff like that when they happen.
7619440	7623840	But mostly I like going to locals that are not usually streamed.
7623840	7628000	So if we can still do our locals and Nintendo's not going to shut those, you know, you know,
7628000	7632480	comic book stores or small arcades, you know, those are not going to get shut down, then
7632480	7634880	I will still try to play Smash when I can.
7634880	7640160	But as far as bigger tournaments, I mean, I go to Evil often and I would definitely
7640160	7644720	join Smash Brothers when it's there at Evil, but it hasn't been in a while.
7644720	7649440	So if it's not at Evil because, you know, because Nintendo, then I guess I'm not going
7649440	7651520	to really play any Smash at any tournaments.
7653120	7653760	Big tournaments.
7653760	7654400	Good point.
7654400	7659120	I hope Nintendo hears, but maybe one person in Nintendo is hearing it, but can't seem
7659120	7661040	to communicate it to anybody else within Nintendo.
7661040	7665760	They also don't like that they play modded Smash as well is one of the problems.
7665760	7667360	Yeah, that's the other thing, too.
7667360	7674320	Yeah, they try to do a tournament using Slippy, which gives the GameCube Smash Melee online
7674320	7675360	connectivity.
7675360	7680240	And they shut that down for one big tournament like last year, two years ago, because it
7680240	7681280	was during COVID.
7681280	7683440	And of course, you have to do the tournament that way.
7683440	7685200	Oh, that whole thing was ridiculous.
7685200	7686480	Yeah, that's stupid.
7686480	7694080	Yeah, I just Nintendo needs to read the room or they need to start hiring some people who
7694080	7695360	are reading the room.
7695360	7700000	Like, maybe what Nintendo could do is hire some Smash tournament organizers to really
7700000	7704720	represent them in these discussions, because it's just a mess.
7704720	7706160	The whole communication thing is a mess.
7706160	7708000	And I feel like they just don't understand.
7708000	7711120	A lot of it's probably just old school ways of thinking.
7711360	7714720	The old guard has been running Nintendo for a very long time.
7714720	7718880	And I think maybe some of that probably needs to be shaken up a little bit, or it's going
7718880	7721920	to come back to bite them because they're going to look to those fans to really push
7721920	7723120	the next Smash game.
7723120	7724400	And I'm sure you know what?
7724400	7730000	I'm sure the next Smash game will sell oodles and oodles of copies, whether Sakurai is involved
7730000	7730560	or not.
7730560	7734080	Just having the name, it's going to sell millions from the go.
7735200	7738160	It's just the way it is with those franchises, but it's just kind of one of those.
7738160	7739920	It could do so much more.
7739920	7746640	It could be featured in comic book stores and makeshift arcades throughout the nation.
7746640	7752800	If Nintendo would just let the community be a community instead of trying to get 10% of
7752800	7753920	it, it's just silly.
7756240	7761680	I'll be very curious to see what happens with the panda resignations, though.
7761680	7765520	That adds a whole other interesting element to this to be continued.
7766640	7768000	Yeah, I'm kind of interested in that, too.
7768160	7772960	Yeah, I want to share one more other thing, not related, though.
7772960	7776160	But kind of to give you a little more background, I guess what I do.
7776800	7779840	What I'm about to do right now, I'm actually outside my friend's house.
7779840	7781840	We're about to play some fighting games.
7782880	7789120	Every weekend we get together, play fighting games, and we do a small tournament amongst
7789120	7790080	ourselves.
7790080	7795120	We have Mjolnir, we have Thor's hammer, and that's our trophy for the night.
7795200	7798800	So out there getting some practice rounds, we do a bracket tournament.
7799600	7801040	Sometimes there's like four of us.
7801040	7802320	Sometimes there's like eight of us.
7803040	7806800	And then whoever wins whatever game we decide that night, they take home the hammer for
7806800	7807120	the week.
7807680	7808320	I love that.
7808320	7809360	That's awesome.
7809360	7810000	That's awesome.
7810000	7813680	It's like, you know, I bet there's a lot of like board game fans that do something similar
7813680	7817840	to that have a prize that they pass amongst themselves for whoever, you know, is the winner
7817840	7818640	or so forth.
7818640	7823360	And that's when the fighting tournaments, fighting game tournaments are or any game
7823360	7828560	tournament, really, DDR, you name it, is the most awesome is when, you know, it's so
7828560	7829600	community driven like that.
7829600	7833840	And I think that's why it sucks to hear about what Nintendo is doing here, because it's
7833840	7836240	like, it makes people scared to do this.
7836240	7840240	Like, is Nintendo going to cease and desist your circle of friends if they find out about
7840240	7840720	it?
7840720	7844400	It's at what point, but at what point do you draw the line?
7845600	7845920	True.
7845920	7846400	Yeah.
7846400	7848320	And sometimes we do try to stream it too.
7848320	7851520	So like, if we do Smash Brothers one night, I might be in fear.
7851600	7853520	Like, I don't know, guys, maybe we shouldn't do this.
7854080	7857040	If Nintendo can't even communicate where the line is.
7858080	7858580	True.
7859840	7862240	But anyway, I hope you don't let that stop you.
7862240	7863120	You know what?
7863120	7864400	We've all got your back.
7864400	7865680	We'll go, we'll go fight.
7865680	7868800	We'll go, we'll go, we'll go fight people if we have to on your behalf.
7868800	7871600	Uh, and you have Thor, you have Thor's hammer.
7871600	7873280	You can fend people off.
7874960	7878400	You know, when you start, you know, issuing out some thunder and lightning, though, I'd
7878400	7880240	be really interested in that.
7881040	7883360	Tiger Claw in chat says Thor's hammer is the prize.
7883360	7884560	I hope the winner is worthy.
7884560	7886240	Well, obviously they proved themselves worthy.
7886240	7886880	Tiger Claw.
7886880	7887680	That's the point.
7887680	7887920	Yeah.
7889120	7891280	SG100Matt says that is awesome.
7891280	7894080	Really brings me back to my high school days of playing games.
7894080	7897760	Well, I'm going to guess if AJ Twist has been listening since the beginning of OLR.
7897760	7902800	AJ Twist is no longer in high school, but, uh, I think that's awesome that you can still
7902800	7904240	kind of live, live that.
7904240	7906560	So yeah, it is something we like to do.
7906560	7907760	That's all the news we can.
7907760	7909840	And I don't have the hammer right now myself.
7910720	7915040	You know, I might need to go win it so I can, uh, lumb out some lightning.
7915040	7915920	What's on deck tonight?
7917120	7917760	Don't know yet.
7917760	7919040	I'm about to walk in and find out.
7919040	7919920	I'm hoping Tekken.
7920960	7923920	I would prefer Soul Calibur or maybe Smash Brothers.
7923920	7926560	Maybe it could be a ironic and go play some Smash tonight.
7927920	7929040	I love some irony.
7929040	7930720	So I'm rooting for Smash Brothers tonight.
7932000	7932560	All right.
7932560	7933440	Good luck to my friend.
7933440	7934080	Win that hammer.
7935760	7936080	All right.
7936080	7936400	Thank you.
7936400	7936880	Have a good night.
7936880	7937520	Thanks for the call.
7937520	7937920	You too.
7937920	7938400	Bye-bye.
7940000	7940480	That's great.
7940480	7940800	Thank you.
7940800	7942160	AJ twist for the call.
7942160	7943360	Really appreciate that.
7943360	7944400	I was, that was great.
7944400	7947680	If you want to call us, uh, in a future week, uh, join our discord
7947680	7949440	server, vog network.com.
7949440	7952000	That's vognetwork.com slash discord.
7952640	7955360	Great to hear from somebody we haven't heard from in a long time as well.
7955360	7957440	Um, and we, we love the regulars.
7957440	7958400	Please do not get me wrong.
7958400	7962320	We love them, but we also love to hear from friends that have been lurking in
7962320	7965760	the podcast, uh, shadows, so to speak for some time.
7965760	7966320	It's awesome.
7966880	7969520	I just wanted to check in real quick before we wrap it all up and see if we
7969520	7971120	have any last minute stories.
7971120	7973280	Loki, I know it's not really the time of your forum.
7973280	7974160	I've been looking.
7974160	7974720	All right.
7974720	7975360	I thought I would.
7975360	7976000	Thought I wouldn't.
7976000	7976480	All right.
7976480	7979200	Well then I guess we'll go ahead and we'll wrap it up for tonight.
7979200	7982320	So thank you all so much for listening to orange launch radio tonight and
7982320	7986480	participating with our show, uh, whether it was your first episode or your 939th
7986480	7988560	episode, we appreciate you being here all the same.
7988560	7989920	Tell a friend or two about the show.
7989920	7992960	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7992960	7994880	But we need more voices to put out on air.
7994880	7995600	Hello.
7995600	7999520	So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or wherever it is,
7999520	8002080	you found this podcast, those going off a long way.
8002080	8003840	And we super appreciate those.
8003840	8007920	I did, by the way, this is the time of year where like the Spotify and
8007920	8010160	podcasters get one of those.
8010160	8012880	And so I got to see that there's all these different countries around the
8012880	8014240	world that listen to the show.
8014240	8018160	And did you know there's more people, there's more people listening to us in
8018160	8023280	like, I want to say it was, it was what I think the Philippines was actually
8023280	8026880	the number two most listened to country above Mexico and Canada.
8026880	8027680	Was the Philippines.
8027680	8031200	I want to say I have to go back and look, sorry, I had a mic mishap here.
8031200	8033520	I have to go back and look to be sure, but I thought that was really cool.
8033520	8036880	So hello to our, uh, folks that are listening out there that are helping
8036880	8038800	to inflate the numbers out there.
8038800	8041360	So I appreciate that.
8041360	8041760	All right.
8041760	8044640	Um, we've got a really good VPN.
8045520	8048480	Maybe, maybe also the only bummer about that.
8048480	8051920	And the reason why I didn't post it publicly on any of our social media
8051920	8057280	channels, it appears to only assess the last 10 episodes because our
8057280	8060160	podcast feed is only the last 10 episodes.
8060160	8064080	So unfortunately, I guess Spotify doesn't hold the statistics for the
8064080	8064960	older stuff.
8064960	8068480	So that is true anyway, for the last like three months or something like
8068480	8068720	that.
8068720	8070320	So I thought that was interesting.
8070320	8071280	So, all right.
8071280	8071920	Anyway.
8071920	8073920	Um, that's it.
8073920	8076320	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.
8076320	8079680	Um, dark Sakura, I'm you're back on the dead bite.
8079680	8081600	You're back on some dbd bullshit.
8081600	8084880	I mean that in the nicest possible way tonight after the show.
8084880	8086320	So I imagine you want to go set up.
8086320	8088000	So do you have any final thoughts for us?
8089120	8091920	Um, not really.
8091920	8092960	People are stinky.
8093520	8096880	And for some reason, my stream deck never wants to stay connected.
8097440	8102000	So, oh, well, everyone try not to suck.
8102720	8103040	All right.
8103040	8103760	I'll do my best.
8103760	8105840	Good to have you back tonight later.
8105840	8106080	All right.
8106080	8106320	Bye.
8107200	8107520	All right.
8108240	8109120	Loki, how about you?
8109120	8110240	What's your final thought for the night?
8110960	8115120	Uh, hopefully look forward to a brand new video from me very soon.
8115840	8116560	Yay.
8116560	8117280	I'll be awesome.
8118160	8122880	Uh, and my final thought is, um, I don't know.
8122880	8128720	I'm gonna, I'm gonna go hook up with wow later tonight, I think, but I'm gonna go walk because
8129680	8132960	it's important to get out and walk and do all that stuff too.
8132960	8136880	And I haven't been able to like literally all weekend because it's been raining, but
8136880	8138720	I think we finally have a break in the rain.
8138720	8144240	So I need to go plant some flowers in Pikmin Bloom because I left it out of my gaming week,
8144880	8147920	but I hit level 69 in Pikmin Bloom.
8148560	8148880	Nice.
8151040	8151360	All right.
8152000	8154800	That's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.
8154800	8158240	We'll be back in seven days on December the 11th to do it all again.
8158240	8160080	I hope you all have a wonderful week.
8160640	8161120	Thanks.
8161120	8162800	And we'll see you next time.
8162800	8163200	Bye bye.
