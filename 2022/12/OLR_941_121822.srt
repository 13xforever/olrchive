00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Not being much of an RPG person, I only now learned Final Fantasy 3 didn't see a release in the PS1 Final Fantasy releases Anthology Chronicles of Origins, not seeing release in the West until the Nintendo DS in 2006.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Two decades later, Screenix is releasing all six of the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters for PlayStation 4 and Switch next year. Apparently only physical releases?

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is the re-re-re-release news with probably 10 more reads needed. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I think it's digital individually. But anyway, hi, hello out there, my friends on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with episode number 941 of our program for December the 18th of 2022.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
A holiday season officially underway in many sorts. My name is Rob Roberts and I am here with my co-hosts as they are every week. Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, hi.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello, hello and I hope you're having a good Hanukkah. It's it's night one.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's great when I get to start setting stuff on fire and butchering Hebrew.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Perfect.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Sounds like a celebration.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It was I had everything all set up and then I was about to do the oil. I'm like, I don't want to do the oil this year. So I just got really good candles.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There you go. That works. I was up. I was actually playing Pokemon Go earlier today. I'll get into gaming weeks and stuff. But as I was trying to walk a lot.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I ended up as I often do down near the Capitol building and they had a little a whole little setup there. It's kind of off to the side.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But it's I don't want to make it sound like they kind of othered it because like if you're taking a shot like straight down at the Capitol, you have the big giant tree in the middle.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But now they have like a menorah that's on the right side that would show up in the frame too. And it looked like they they were probably I mean, I was there like three o'clock, so it was still light out.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I imagine they were going to do a big ceremony at sundown. But yeah, so it was nice to see that.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's cool. Yeah. I haven't made any latkes yet. I've had some tummy trouble, but I'm planning on doing it at some point this week.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That was an OLR tradition I miss back when we were live and in person. We'd often get some potato pancakes on the first night of

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The first night it happened to me that the show was on but yeah, and and the house would smell like potato deliciousness.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Mm hmm. Good times.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Maybe maybe one day.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Maybe one day one day we can you know what I'll eat potato latkes anytime I don't give a it's just I'll drink it I'll drink I'll eat a gingerbread cookie anytime like it doesn't have to be the holidays. Let's be clear.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hello.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm doing pretty good.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You got one of my very faves playing behind you. I actually I can't tell if that's the stage from Jumpman or Jumpman Jr. on.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's the original Jumpman on Commodore 64. Love it. One of my faves. Was that something you were playing this week?

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, yeah, because I'm well, I met Randy Glover, the creator of Jumpman.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, get out.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, how'd that happen?

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And I also got I got this.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, there was a convention. I there was a convention here in town. Wasn't there like one of those gamer expos over at the Scottish Rite?

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And so he was there. They were they had Jumpman. I've never played Jumpman.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I played Jumpman Jr. and I was playing on the Coleco Vision, which is like, oh, yeah.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He's like, I didn't I forgot that there is one on the Coleco Vision, I guess, because he's like I did the Commodore 64 in Atari.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't know if he ported it or someone else ported it to the Coleco Vision.

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But yeah, I did get the medium and then they had a raffle as well as going to charity. So I entered the raffle and I won.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, I had three choices. I get one bag of buttons, a second bag of buttons or the button that was on his shirt signed by him.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And so I got the button on his shirt signed by him that says creator of Jumpman.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Nice.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Nice. I didn't I didn't know in the gaming industry we took people's clothes and had them autographed.

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I thought that was I thought that was just at the Magic Mike show. But here we are.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah. So yeah. So yeah, I did. I met him this week. But yeah, I was like, Jumpman Jr. was like a game like my fave game.

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Going back to the Coleco Vision. It was like one I played all the time.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In fact, when I got the Coleco Vision mini thing that they had, that was the reason why they had Jumpman Jr. in it.

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So it's awesome. I really like that game. I am not very good at it, though, because, well, they had a Commodore 64 mini playing it.

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And I was I've never used a Commodore 64 controller. I mean, it's sort of like an Atari controller, but I'm just not used to the old joysticks anymore.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So it's yeah, it's it's that game is like so touchy anyways, as it is like you have to be very precise with your jumps and like getting right to the edge and stuff.

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That controller is not meant for that.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I was gonna say Jumpman Jr. is on the C64 mini as well. And I would imagine the C64 regular one that they just put out not long ago.

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know if I have 25 bucks to buy the cartridge.

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The actual Coleco cartridge?

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've got two Coleco Visions.

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, wow. That's and you know, when you say cartridge, it's funny because a lot of people forget the Commodore 64 actually had cartridges as well.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And I actually had Jumpman Jr. as a cartridge on Commodore 64. So yeah, I always forget that that computer had cartridges, but it did.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So that's the version for Coleco Atom and Coleco Vision.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You know, that was a game I didn't have I had like Mouse Trap and Carnival and Space Fury and Turbo and stuff like that.

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
A lot of those ports back in the day were done by other people, though it wasn't often I mean, look at a game like Pitfall, right? David Crane's Pitfall for the Atari 2600.

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That game was ported literally you name it in the 80s. They put Pitfall on it right in one form or another either Pitfall or Pitfall to the Lost Caverns was even on like the Sega Master System.

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think it's a port of the arcade game or something, but but I digress. They weren't all David Crane.

64
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So it's interesting how, yeah, oftentimes other people would end up being responsible for translating, you know, a game over and with mixed success, sometimes look at, you know, Pac-Man on the 2600, an infamous example, certainly not done by the same folks.

65
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If they were kind of behind some limitations, they're like, well, we need to we need you to fit this much game into this much space.

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's like, well, I can't do that without making compromises. Too bad.

67
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You know, but yeah, I think I've seen that they've done like some fan conversions or stuff like that using a larger ROM in it.

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It looks pretty close, but yeah, yeah, it was cool to meet him.

69
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And of course, he is also behind Summer Games and Summer Games, too.

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So, oh, yeah, epics they were given I wanted like because like the way it was working is like, OK.

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The person that wins the raffle, you get to pick one thing and then it gets down to the end.

72
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So they had a sealed copy of Jumpman for the Commodore 64.

73
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I wanted that. And then they also had a Commodore 64 mini. I would have taken that, but they're fine. It's fine.

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah, the pins fun. That's fun.

75
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I want to hear more about the convention, but I do want to go to our chat room, of course, and get some comments because we do tape live every Sunday night.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
At nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

77
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's VOG Network. And we're on right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although Bobby Black Wolf not on tonight,

78
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
as him and Mrs. Black Wolf are celebrating the holidays a little bit early this year.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But Bobby will be back next week on December 25th.

80
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes, even on that day with a new episode of his program.

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And I know he has missed you all because he was out last week as well, but he'll be back next week.

82
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So hello to everybody in chat. Tigerclaw pointing out Jumpman was Mario's original name, if I recall.

83
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, that was his name when he was the villain in Donkey Kong.

84
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Or no, I'm sorry. Hello. He's the villain in Donkey Kong Jr. Hello, bang bang.

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He was a hero in Donkey Kong. But yes, I believe they did call him Jumpman in that game.

86
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So I wonder if maybe because of Jumpman Jr's success, because Jumpman and Jumpman Jr, those games weren't just big in the US.

88
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Keep in mind, the Commodore 64 was huge in the UK. Huge.

89
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So I wonder if because Jumpman kind of ended up being part of the pop culture, you know, lexicon over there, they had to find a new name.

90
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know. I mean, it would be an interesting documentary someday.

91
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Far above the ZX Spectrum and its other computer systems.

92
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So the CDC, all that.

93
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, all of it. You know, it's so funny how in this day and age, we're always like, oh, it's PlayStation versus Microsoft versus Nintendo when like in the 80s, there were like 10 different things all competing at once.

94
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There. I mean, I remember I'm dating myself, I don't care. I remember magazine ads that would show off a game like let's say I think actually mousetrap would be a good example.

95
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And it would say it was Oh, actually, it was always like the Parker Brothers ones for Commodore 64. Like Frogger. Frogger is a great example.

96
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It would have here's everything the Commodore version, the Apple two version, the TI 99 4a version.

97
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Amiga.

98
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Maybe not for that particular game, but later ones. Yes.

99
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The and the 2600, the 5200, the Coleco vision, the it was it was literally everything.

100
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I remember the Tandy computer. Oh, yeah, the cartridge that you shoved it up on the side of it and the silver keys.

101
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Can one of you can one of you Google experts like Tiger Claw or something since I'm live trying to do a program could what do you find like one of those 80s ads that shows that like look for like an old Frogger ad or like Popeye I think had one if you remember that game.

102
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I would just love to like show that on screen as like an example here.

103
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And and have a little better detail for those that are listening on the podcast feed because even though we do tape live on Sunday nights, of course, we are available as a podcast as well on most of the places where you can find podcasts such as Spotify or iTunes or what have you.

104
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Tiger Claw sent me a YouTube link. I was looking more for a picture but I can't like upload the thing but yeah, I see here. I'll post it in chat real fast.

105
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Um, but yeah, it's basically got a bunch of different versions of the game box floating in water.

106
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So it's like in, in television, like in the 80s. That's close. That's close. Yeah, I see what you're doing with all the different boxes. That's close. I saw the one depth put to the, those are close but it's not the one I'm thinking of.

107
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, but you know what ads looks like back then where it wasn't just like like ads today or like, here's a picture, you know, yeah, and then, you know, and then in the past, it was like, here's a complete novel and backstory of every one of these games, I found

108
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
it I found it okay how do I get this image copy image address. Okay.

109
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes, this is what I'm going to let me show this on the other screen here sorry I am doing this is the joy of doing things live sometimes but I'm doing it live. So, what you can see here this is an ad for Popeye, and you actually see all the different screens it

110
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:48,000
shows the 5200 the Commodore 64 I'm going to put this link in chat as well. The Atari 400 and 800, which I which I even forgot was a system.

111
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So and so on. So that's, that's, yeah, it shows like all the different systems there. I'll put that link in chat to I promise, just easy, but you could just see the scope of like all the systems that things were on. So it's just, it's just wild. Anyway.

112
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:15,000
All right. Loki, I said I said I would ask you about the convention. So what else did you see? Because what's funny, I got pushed a Facebook ad for that convention. And it was the first time I'd heard of it, but I got the Facebook ad on Saturday night. So it was like the thing was half

113
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
over already. And I was like, well, I'm not gonna go today.

114
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And I didn't stay very long. There's not a lot to do there. If you unless you're watching panels, which I wasn't the whole reason I was going there was because there was some people I wanted to give physical copies of my game to just because either promotion or I figured they would enjoy it like john riggs.

115
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:57,000
One he he does. He has a YouTube channel. He's got like, like gaming nostalgia stuff that he does. And I've been wanting to send him one for a while. And I just haven't really bothered to look up his PO box or whatever. And so I saw that he was going to be in town. So I was like, Okay, cool. I'll go give one to him. And then

116
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:17,000
so he was there. And so I got to meet with him and talk about like he does some game dev as well a little bit with his friend. And so he had a few games that he was selling as well. So we got to do that. And then he actually bought a copy off of me as well for his friend. So I actually sold one.

117
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And then there was who else was there? Joey Ferris with game explain. So I saw him there. I've recognized him forks. I think I follow him on YouTube as well. And then I know gamer dad was there. And there's one other guy I don't remember I think it may have been this Gabbo the giver, who is like this pixel game squad thing. They they look for NES games and stuff.

118
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm gonna assume all these content creators are based out of SAC or the Bay Area.

119
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't think so. I know. John Riggs is not I don't think content creators specifically.

120
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, God, you can't do my voicemail. Yeah, yeah, I bet.

121
00:14:46,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Sung in Mortal Kombat two as well. So, yeah, they had a different, different group. Daniel. He's, he's also a doctor, apparently. So he has a book called Mortal doctor, which I think that's funny.

122
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:45,000
They usually were set up. So they didn't really want to play anything. I walked around the vendor booth area a little bit about Contra knows about it. Like, I don't know, there was stuff that was kind of expensive, like in specially they had games that were marked up quite a bit in the condition that they were in was just not good. I was looking for some indie games and stuff, too. They've had a few guys that had a indie NES games and stuff. They're not homebrew. And I was looking for some of that, but it just wasn't wasn't being it.

123
00:15:46,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So we were in and out in about an hour, like, honestly. But I mean, it's fun if you like, you know, the panels and stuff and want to see like some of these people and get their autographs or whatever. It's a good time. I mean, and we lucked out because the last time we went, it was a week earlier. And that's in the middle of that stupid Sacramento marathon that they have the international one. So getting to the Scottish Rite Center was just a pain because it's the marathon run literally goes right past it.

124
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And so all the streets are blocked off, whereas this year is a week later. So it was just like, no traffic, easy in and out wasn't super crowded. So it's good. And I ended up giving away about like, four copies of the game and I sold one. So five, five pixel poops, number two out there. And funny enough, like, John Riggs had messaged his friend like showed him a picture what it was. And the guy's like, Oh, yeah, I just bookmark that page today. So

125
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Wow.

126
00:16:44,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, it'd be fun. Like if people just get the plate and stuff. The one there was digital clips was there too. And I should have talked about publishing, but I didn't didn't get around to it. So it's all right. You blew it off. You had your chance. Sorry.

127
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, it's just awkwardly. Yeah, I get it. You have to be in the right mindset. Yeah, so it was it was okay. But yeah, that's really the whole reason I went is just to give out copies of the game. That sounds like fun. I haven't got it. I got to make more because I'm out. Well, I have two left, but I'm out of physical copies of the first 12 at least I wish I'd known I would have gone. I just Yeah, it wasn't on my radar, unfortunately. So yeah, it's too bad. But I have to keep an eye out for the next one. So it's fun. Yeah. All right. Well, let's get into some gaming news.

128
00:17:32,000 --> 00:18:01,760
We'll come back and talk about our gaming weeks. We want to definitely get Dark Soccer's gaming week and I have some stuff too. So we'll get to that. But first, let's get into our kind of lead topic for tonight. Although I mean, this is this is kind of an ongoing saga. And let's be real. We're getting into that time of year, you know, with with a Hanukkah starting us off tonight. We all know then that it's Christmas, then it's New Year's all the other winter celebrations as well. We know that the news is going to slow down a little bit. So but we'll, we'll push through with what's out there. We still have some ongoing developments in the

129
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,200
Microsoft and Activision Blizzard saga. Yes, Loki.

130
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:31,920
Yeah, so there's just more news coming out about that. And I think they've already kind of said that as well. But Microsoft offered Sony call it I mean, first off, they've offered Sony Call of Duty on their platform for 10 years if they're willing to sign an agreement for it. And then also with that, you know, they're saying that, you know, they also offer to put it on their PlayStation Plus

131
00:18:31,920 --> 00:19:01,080
service as well, to kind of, you know, be an extra thing that they could offer for their new users to kind of spice up PlayStation Plus and make it a little bit more valuable, I guess. But I still think that they're basically saying that's still not enough. And same, I think like the FTC and like the European Union are also investigating everything because they feel that it's not competitive enough.

132
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:31,000
Once again, like, I get it, it is not it, it is the lack of competition. But like, why this and not discovery? Like, that's, I still, I'm still like scratching my head over that way. Because like, like, I get it, this could harm Sony down the road. But at the same time, like they would do the same in a heartbeat. Like, I, I don't doubt it. But you know, when I see that type of merger, like with discovery and Warner Brothers and HP and all

133
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:59,240
that stuff, like, I feel more harm is being done there. And like, then this, granted, and I'm sure that Sony sees the writing on the wall, like even a 10 year agreement doesn't, that's 10 years, that's like, you know, another console cycle, and then they have the advantage in that they see that that could be a problem. But I guarantee if this doesn't go through, they will try to buy do the same thing. And then in ironically, it'll probably go through because that's how the world works.

134
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:29,120
I'm looking in chat for some comments. DJ Rama S in chat says Sony needs to stop whining. As 2100 Matt says, I think we all know if the roles were reversed, Sony would offer MS nothing. They tell him to kick rocks. I feel MS is going out of their way to make this work. I'm actually curious if there's anyone in chat, and I promise no judgment. We want to get all the voices here. I'm curious if there's anyone out there that maybe agrees with the FTC side of thing and does not want to see the Microsoft and Activision Blizzard merger go through and maybe what the reasons are for

135
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:58,920
that. I mean, admittedly, and I kind of my opinion really hasn't changed. What I said a couple weeks ago is it's like I don't love the dog eat big dog sort of thing that the games industry is becoming. I don't love it. But it's this particular circumstance where something needs to change at activism Blizzard where I'm fine with it. Even though yes, I realize it's a huge company. Microsoft's also a huge company and it is going to give them a huge share of it. I I'm not sure I'm convinced it's giving them a larger share than what Sony has.

136
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:28,800
Sony Sony has a large entertainment arm that they could integrate better with PlayStation that they're simply not doing. And I've said this before on the show, PlayStation Plus, how much of a bigger deal would that be if it actually gave you some Sony movies? Some Sony music, right? I guess it does give you like Crunchyroll, which is Sony owned or like a trial or something. I don't know. Like it gives you some limited Sony things, but it's it's not at the level that you

137
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:48,760
would expect Sony could offer where Microsoft doesn't have a CD label or a music label or that I Well, a large one, a major one, I should say that I know of, or an entertainment production company, really. So it's, I think it's Sony's own fault. They're not leveraging things more. I don't know.

138
00:21:48,760 --> 00:22:17,240
And, and they are doing the same thing on a smaller level. I mean, they're making individual deals with different game studios to basically put it on their platform for a year before it gets to go on any other console platform. And they do that quite often. And they gate a bunch of stuff like Spider-Man in, you know, a lot of it funny enough is around Square Enix, but like gating off Spider-Man from the whole Microsoft platform for the Marvel Avengers game.

139
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:47,000
Which is just stupid. But that's something that they do. Yeah, I really don't I have a hard time believing like, at least, you know, you have this company that's saying, Listen, we're committed to bringing this to your platform still. Like, I mean, if it were me, like, like, after all this bullshit, I'd be like, you know, all that Skyrim stuff and all the new Elder Scrolls games. Well, fuck you guys ain't getting shit now.

140
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:59,880
causes problems with Activision. We're, we're fucking cutting that shit off. Yeah. I don't know, like, I would be, I mean, that's what's gonna come is, you know, yeah, oh, yeah, starfield, Nat, you ain't getting that shit.

141
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:26,480
I also kind of wonder, like with Microsoft being willing to make so many concessions on the Activision side, if it if it isn't really Blizzard, maybe King, but I feel like it's Blizzard that they really want. Like, I feel like Microsoft really wants Diablo, Warcraft, Overwatch, and that whole that even though I don't know, I'm hearing that maybe Overwatch two isn't performing at the level that people thought it would.

142
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:56,360
I don't know. I feel like a lot of that stuff I'm looking at is kind of slanted based on people's biases one way or the other. So I'm not I'm not sure what the facts really say about that. But it seemed like Overwatch two at least had a huge launch. But admittedly, they just had a new season start. And I could care less, but I'm playing a different Blizzard product. So maybe it maybe it's all the same as long as as long as I'm doing something right. But anyway, my point is, I wonder if it's Blizzard that Microsoft really has their eye on. I don't know.

143
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,320
Maybe I mean, I don't know, like, we'll have to see what happens to this whole thing anyways. Because like, what's gonna happen to Activision? Like if this doesn't go through?

144
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:35,080
I don't know. They get bought by Tencent. And then I believe that would actually be worse. I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash a vog network. Mike deaf says I don't agree with the FTC. I understand why people would be fine with it. But this is a good move for everyone. At least involved. As Joe and her mat says this will take a lot longer now that these antitrust suits that are coming. It's really not going to be finalized one way or another until 2024. So DJ rama says PlayStation is keeping Sony afloat. Yeah.

145
00:24:35,320 --> 00:25:05,280
And also adds Microsoft teamed up with crunchyroll for free trial subs. She hold 10 says I would rather Xbox set spend the 70 billion on a new super game and studio from the ground up. To be fair, Microsoft did buy a boatload of studios. They do have a lot of those. And I'm not sure we're seeing oodles and oodles of things coming out of it yet. But I think we're gonna like I think it's coming. And we've seen a few I you know, obviously, we had like Psychonauts two, you know, we'll, we'll see some more. But to be fair, they did

146
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:13,480
spend a lot of money on like smaller studios to try to build them some some new things. I can't see what's up.

147
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:20,320
Whatever happens. I'd like to see though that the biggest defenders get canned immediately.

148
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:34,760
Oh, God. Yeah, that's that's the number one thing I can't wait for is for Bobby Kotick to be unceremoniously removed. I mean, it sucks because he's probably gonna get a big payout because of contracts and stuff. But not just him. Oh, no, yeah, not just him. But he's he's he's like

149
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:54,080
that. He's he's the it's just like eBroom plus is not the only problem at bird app right now. But he's the one you want to see go most of all. But he has he has a team of enablers just like Bobby Kotick does. So I don't know. Anyway,

150
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,240
thing is, is that in the long run, though, all of these people that are like this are a symptom of a bigger problem.

151
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,480
Oh, sure. Absolutely.

152
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,800
Yeah, when you start holding those people accountable, the problem starts getting resolved.

153
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:15,880
Yeah. And that's, I've referenced that on previous episodes, too, is that this is a game industry problem. That's what this this whole issue became much bigger than Blizzard is

154
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,960
much more than a gaming industry issue. Oh, sure. This is institutionalized.

155
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,960
Sure. I'll agree with that. Yeah.

156
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:30,720
It's just the fact that it comes out in the biggest boys club that there is, but you see it all over the place in the corporate world.

157
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,040
It's exacerbated by the gaming industry.

158
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,960
This is what it's like to work as a female.

159
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,520
Just saying it doesn't matter where you go.

160
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,760
Even the most enlightened of companies, you're still going to you're still going to encounter sexism.

161
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,520
It's it's there. It's ingrained.

162
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,760
You have to start holding people to the fire in the worst possible way to get it to change.

163
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,960
I don't disagree.

164
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,160
Going back to chat with more comments.

165
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,480
I can't see in chat says as a new Xbox gamer, I want it to go through.

166
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,000
But I also don't want gaming to be like the movie and TV industry.

167
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,680
I don't like having content locked behind subscriptions, subscriptions add up.

168
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:18,920
And that's maybe a reference towards what I'm assuming is Xbox Game Pass and how a lot of stuff is being invested in that.

169
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,440
And we kind of see the whole like Netflix of gaming type of contest going on there.

170
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,680
So I get that.

171
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,960
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, Overwatch is still a seller in terms of the esports aspect.

172
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,040
The game still does well on the streamed tournament circuit.

173
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,120
Oh, maybe. Maybe Microsoft wants Overwatch League.

174
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,840
That could very well be possible.

175
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,160
I don't know.

176
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,600
Blizzard doesn't want Overwatch League, so I mean.

177
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,360
But I can understand where maybe if you have that infrastructure that Overwatch League has set up,

178
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,800
maybe Microsoft can leverage that into getting more eyes on something like, I don't know, Halo Reach.

179
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm reaching admittedly, but, you know, something that, you know, gets the other Microsoft competitive games that they would like to have at that same level.

180
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,120
I don't know.

181
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,160
I acknowledge I'm reaching a little bit, but, you know, who knows?

182
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,120
Only Microsoft knows for sure what their motivations are.

183
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,680
All right.

184
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,560
Well, let's talk about our motivations and the types of games that we have been playing this week in a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week?

185
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,000
And we will start with DarkSakura.

186
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,840
How was your gaming week?

187
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,360
It was it was all right.

188
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,760
It was the usual stuff, Dead by Daylight.

189
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:43,600
Lots of funny shenanigans, I've been playing a lot with Gwen and with one of my newer streamer buddies, Raven McPherse.

190
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,320
Really fun.

191
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:53,120
Um, I have been playing my stupid wordscapes game, like pretty hardcore lately.

192
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:00,680
Um, I have been playing a lot of pinball, just, you know, the stuff we have in my house.

193
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,480
I actually tried to play some Twilight Zone the other day and I forgot that it doesn't have a ball save.

194
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,440
Oops.

195
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,080
Um, and, uh, I played some Colds of the Lamb.

196
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm actually, I've actually beaten it and now I've gotten all of the tarot cards.

197
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,960
So I'm trying to figure out what I have left to do in the game other than start a new play through.

198
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,520
Um, and I'm on the third leg of Final Fantasy 5.

199
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,080
We're just about to go to the Fork Tower.

200
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,480
Um, and then after that's done, I was going to put it up between Star Ocean and Emerald Dragon.

201
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,120
But if I played Emerald Dragon, I would want to play the PC Engine version.

202
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:47,920
Um, so I'd have to set up the capture and then find a patch that I can run on, uh, run simultaneously with my, with my disc copy.

203
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,360
Cause I do own an original Emerald Dragon.

204
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:55,480
It's not a very expensive game, but I think Star Ocean would be a lot easier to do.

205
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,320
So I'm probably going to be playing Star Ocean next.

206
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,280
Nice.

207
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,880
All right, we'll move on to Loki.

208
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,200
I know we talked about the, uh, uh, convention you were at this weekend, but what else for your gaming week?

209
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,800
It was pretty much just Jumpman and Minecraft.

210
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,000
It was all Minecraft this week.

211
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,240
Just, um, working on, uh, editing for different videos and stuff like that.

212
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,720
I was gonna say, this was your big week off to produce.

213
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,520
Yeah, you know, like it was, but it didn't, I don't feel as productive as I should have been.

214
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,920
Um, even though like I wasn't wasting time, it just, it doesn't feel like I got a lot done.

215
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:41,440
I was hoping to get multiple videos done, but I got a short out, which technically was done weeks ago, but, uh, I published that and that did okay.

216
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:53,000
Um, but yeah, I needed to do more shorts because, um, that seemed to be, it's a really quick, like 3000 views and, um, I got like a few subs out of it too.

217
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,680
So it's not bad.

218
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,760
It's good for, um, getting noticed.

219
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:04,120
And then, um, just, yeah, I've been working on, uh, the episode for the modded series, uh, which I'm almost done with.

220
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,720
Hopefully I'll have that out either.

221
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,960
It'll probably be tomorrow.

222
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:14,040
And then, um, I still be, I don't even know I'm going to work on for the SMB stuff for channel 64.

223
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,000
I mean, I know what I should work on, but I don't know if it's gonna, gonna happen.

224
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,840
And I need to work on more of the, the mega base stuff.

225
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,120
Um, but I also have vault hunters.

226
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
I just started to that.

227
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,400
Haven't filmed anything in yet, or at least I've, I've keep filming things and then deleting it.

228
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:40,360
Cause I can't, uh, well, windows updates decide to, um, tweak on my audio and video settings, which is fun.

229
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,800
So like I kept one, my audio was recording incredibly quiet to the point where I couldn't even hear it.

230
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,080
Um, thanks to it, enabling some stupid program that I don't normally have launch anyways.

231
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,680
It's like some thing that some companion program that came with my, uh, I mean, I guess it's an audio driver

232
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,920
because we don't have sound cards anymore.

233
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:11,160
Um, and then like OBS change settings where the, um, there was an audio delay, like a two second audio delay

234
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:18,760
that was unfixable because windows 10, when it updated, switched my audio from 44 to 48.

235
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Um, and so it was annoying.

236
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,480
So I finally figured that out and track that down, but it was getting to the point where like, I'd have to sync my

237
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:36,000
mic audio and the video that sync the video and its own audio to get it to work right.

238
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,960
And that takes, you know, multiply that times the number of clips I have in there.

239
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,560
It just really compounds and adds a lot more time to everything.

240
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,520
So now that it's all fixed, it should be more streamlined going forward.

241
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,280
It's just, you know, figuring that out over the few days, um, took a while.

242
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,880
Um, but yeah, I had fun this week and I mean, I'm going to have some more time throughout, you know,

243
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,480
the next couple of weeks because, you know, we have the holidays, so 40 weekends and stuff like that.

244
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,240
Um, so yeah, I should be able to work on a little bit more of that as well.

245
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,960
Um, I'm hoping to get more into the groove in it.

246
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,480
I know we've, um, got some exciting things around the corner with, you know, the SMPs.

247
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,240
So, you know, new year will be fun too.

248
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,600
Um, and then my Minecraft, I mean, Mojang has been super quiet about their updates.

249
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,000
So, I mean, who knows when that's coming?

250
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,520
So we may have tons of time left before we have to reset the server or something.

251
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,800
You know, you were talking about, you were talking about YouTube shorts.

252
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,320
Have you tried, uh, syndicating your content on TikTok as well?

253
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,520
I know, I know, I'm just talk and, uh, Instagram stories and stuff like that.

254
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,160
Taken me years to figure it out, but I finally got sucked into TikTok a little bit.

255
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,880
And I will tell you that algorithm for discovering stuff.

256
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,280
I, it, it's, it, it does it better than any other platform.

257
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,920
Let me tell you.

258
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,800
And I'm seeing stuff as I go through my feed, I see stuff with like zero likes and zero comments.

259
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,920
So I know occasionally it pushes stuff that it thinks I'm going to like in there.

260
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,920
And that's how these things are getting lots of views because people don't just watch one TikTok.

261
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,600
They watch like 20 all at once.

262
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,960
And so they'll see some that are from their usuals and then it sneaks some new ones in there.

263
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,520
So it's, it's interesting.

264
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,560
That whole TikTok space is very interesting to me.

265
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,000
So I need to sit down like, and just knock out because I've set up a template with this first one.

266
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,720
So it took a little bit longer to make the short.

267
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:30,560
Um, but I have a template now set up where I should be able to just go back to my older videos and start with just like the, the build time lapses.

268
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,520
And condense those down to a minute and then just upload those and schedule them out.

269
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:43,160
And then, um, I'll have to go through some of the other stuff and find clips that I like, like funny things or something like that and do all that.

270
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,680
Um, but yeah, like this first one was my first major build that was on my first S and P.

271
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,440
So that's like over a year old now.

272
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,600
It's like almost two years old.

273
00:34:52,680 --> 00:35:00,320
And so I'm starting there and kind of going more towards current, I mean, mix it up, I don't know, it might not be in order, but.

274
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,440
But yeah, I got like really good engagement.

275
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:08,280
Like, you know, um, I think we got eight subs in about 3,100 views in like a day.

276
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,560
Yeah.

277
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,800
And it's, it's really weird how the, like the algorithm works with it.

278
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,520
It'll, it'll push it and it's gone.

279
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,320
Like there's no engagement after that.

280
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,000
So, but you know, you just do those every once in a while.

281
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,680
Even eight new subs from a short is great.

282
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,280
Like I, I'm excited as fuck.

283
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,480
If I get two new follows on a Twitch stream, I'm sure Jamie's in a similar boat where it's like, you get two new

284
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,240
followers, it's like, I had a great stream today.

285
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,400
Well, yeah.

286
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,400
And that's the thing.

287
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:43,520
It's most frustrating about YouTube is like, I will put in like a month worth of effort for a video or something like that and see like almost nothing from it.

288
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:50,840
And then I'll have one of my, um, you know, server partners, he'll start a hardcore series.

289
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:58,360
Where he's basically just building and he gets 600 subs out of it and just an immense amount of watch time from just like a video.

290
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,200
And it's not like, I'm like, I don't, I'm not jealous.

291
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:08,520
I'm not, it's just like, it's, it's very frustrating because you don't know, like, you would say, okay, well, what is the algorithm looking for?

292
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,320
Like, I will do that thing, but you don't know.

293
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,320
And nobody knows.

294
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:19,040
It's like, you just keep trying things and see what sticks, but I'm telling you what it's looking for is short content.

295
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,200
That's going to be what gets you.

296
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:28,080
I mean, I'm not saying specifically for the YouTube algorithm, but like short content and leveraging that to the places like YouTube shorts, TikTok.

297
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:34,640
And that sort of thing that will, and honestly, we need to take our own fucking advice and put clips of this show on those platforms as well.

298
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,040
You know, we haven't, technically we have a vog network TikTok.

299
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,280
We just haven't used it yet.

300
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,120
Keyword yet.

301
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,640
Um, but it's there, you can go follow it.

302
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:54,320
Um, but, uh, you know, I, I really think that's the secret because my opinion is when it comes to 20 minute YouTube videos, you're going to watch the things that you already know you like.

303
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,520
When it comes to minute and a half shorts, you're more willing to sit there and watch random things that are put in front of you.

304
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Cause you're just binging them.

305
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,560
I think that's a real key difference, but right anyway.

306
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,360
But yeah, and, and, and it depends, like it just like the type type of content.

307
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:16,520
Some people don't really want to watch us in peace right now, but then there's also some people that will watch the same thing over and over or the same person over and over.

308
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
There's, there's something for everyone.

309
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,840
There's nothing for everyone.

310
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah.

311
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,800
It's just, it's, it's all about tricking the algorithm to get it to the most impressions and you'll, it's just a percentage game at that point.

312
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,440
All right.

313
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,360
Uh, my gaming week, not, not terribly exciting compared to previous weeks.

314
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,040
I, I still am on my Warcraft bullshit.

315
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,080
I got to level 64, uh, on my orc priest, which by the way is a new combination.

316
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,200
Orcs couldn't be priests before this expansion.

317
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,800
So, or I should say my priestess, uh, cause I'm a lady orc, uh, named super Sprode.

318
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,240
One of my favorite freeze pop songs there ever was.

319
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,560
So, um, I actually, I recycled an old rogue or something just to steal the name.

320
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:04,480
So, um, yeah, I, I've still been on that and that's been fun cause I've been in the new expansion areas, which are, it's, it's, it's weird cause they're very vertical.

321
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:12,680
They're very flying, uh, based, which they came up with a new form of flying for this, the dragon, which is the name of the expansion dragon flight.

322
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,640
So it's interesting.

323
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,320
It took me a minute to warm up to it, but now that I've warmed up to it, I'm like, I kind of like it for being able to explore.

324
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,920
I think it's a good medium between they don't want you to just fly around in the zone and finish all the quests instantly.

325
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:30,480
And, uh, you know, have a sense of you're not wasting time walking everywhere.

326
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,120
It's interesting.

327
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:42,280
Um, other games I've been continuing on, uh, my, uh, AR gaming stuff, specifically Pokemon go had a two day community day this weekend and I had some shinies to catch up on.

328
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,720
So I went pretty hard at least yesterday.

329
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,400
I walked 10,000 steps today was harder because I knew I had OLR at six o'clock, so I couldn't stay out.

330
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,320
Um, but I think I got like four or five shinies today.

331
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,840
I got a lot more yesterday.

332
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,000
I, I think I still don't have a shiny Litwick.

333
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,800
I think that was, I couldn't do that community day for some reason.

334
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:12,240
I still don't have a shiny Litwick, so I'm going to have to beg somebody else for one that got like 40 of them, but I think I filled in the other shinies I needed.

335
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:19,160
Um, Starly, I remember was one, I think that was when I had COVID was Starly day and I was able to get a couple of those today.

336
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,440
So I feel better about that now.

337
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,320
Uh, and then I've also been playing Pikmin Bloom had some very controversial changes this week.

338
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:33,640
I'm not going to go too into the weeds cause I know not a ton of people play Pikmin Bloom, but I've really enjoyed it as far as like a passive type of experience.

339
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,960
They changed the mushroom combat system though.

340
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,040
And they, they really did not make popular changes.

341
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,200
I get what they were going for, but they made battles that used to take five minutes, take seven days.

342
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,720
That's not an exaggeration, literally seven.

343
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,400
It's a complete change to the system.

344
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:59,200
I get why they were doing it because they were trying to encourage people to get to see each other actually battling together and stuff like that.

345
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,680
But they went a little too hard to the extreme.

346
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:11,640
On the plus side, the team heard the feedback within two days and cut down all the times by either 50% or 75%, depending on the level of mushroom.

347
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,080
And I think it's much more reasonable now.

348
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,560
Um, so I think, I think Pikmin Bloom's in an interesting place right now.

349
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,760
Um, I'm, I'm still enjoying it, but I also think there's some nuances with the system they need to do.

350
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:34,800
Like they need to have a way where you are required to drop a certain amount of Pikmin in there because it's too easy to exploit the system and just drop one Pikmin in there.

351
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,560
And then, but you're also robbing yourself of leveling up Pikmin that way.

352
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:38,920
I don't know.

353
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,040
It's, it's just a weird thing.

354
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,360
Uh, and then if five people are on a mushroom, that mushroom needs to phase out and a new one brought in.

355
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:53,120
So five more people can jump on it because it's making play for the game in some places like Tokyo, I hear like impossible because people jump on a mushroom.

356
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,600
And then nobody else could do it.

357
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,640
So anyway, there's still some little nuances.

358
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,960
I'm not going to go too deep in the weeds because I know not a lot of people play Pikmin Bloom, but, um, I, I do.

359
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:11,080
And I, I still like it as a walking incentivizer and I'm still level 69, but I'm only like 15,000 steps away from level 70.

360
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,960
So sadly, I won't get to say that too much longer.

361
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,000
Um, what else have I played?

362
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,920
Oh, I played an interesting thing today.

363
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,600
Uh, cause I saw Alan playing it and I was like, oh, I forgot this is a thing.

364
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,560
Oh, this is free.

365
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,640
If I already own the game.

366
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,280
Okay, cool.

367
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,840
I'll do this.

368
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:36,200
So I got portal for RTX, the new version of portal that they released with like the souped up graphics because I was like, I have a fancy new computer with a fancy new graphics card.

369
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,800
Let me try this.

370
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:51,160
It doesn't run great in 4k, but on Alan's machine he has, so Alan actually has a really nice monitor, but it only runs ultra HD or 2k, but it's a really like pretty finished.

371
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,760
Like it has that slight curve to it.

372
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,720
It's really bright.

373
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,440
I've watched him play Fortnite on it.

374
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,280
It looks really good.

375
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:09,760
And I watched him play the portal RTX game and it looked pretty good, but, um, he got a much better frame rate than I did because mine's in 4k and it's, it's kind of ugly and his is in 2k and it runs pretty decently.

376
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,960
So that was, but it was, it's really nice to look at.

377
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,800
I played like the first couple of stages and I was like, okay, I didn't, it isn't worth it to have the nicer graphics.

378
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,920
But is it, isn't it nice to feel like my very expensive investment is already outdated by that game?

379
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,840
My very expensive investment.

380
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,040
It's not just that game.

381
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,200
It's a lot of games are ray tracing is still not optimized well enough for even like modern cards.

382
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,960
Like even like on a 40 90, I think with that game, it doesn't run great.

383
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,440
It's just the game.

384
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:44,680
Fair.

385
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,240
So, and a lot of games, it's a lot of games.

386
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,960
It seems like ray tracing was just not worth it.

387
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,360
Yeah.

388
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:50,840
It's not.

389
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,600
Um, the only other thing I touched this week was Tetris effect connected.

390
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,760
Because I've been going into the Epic store every day to get the free game.

391
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,440
Cause you know, they started their, whatever, 15 days of holiday downloads, whatever it is.

392
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,640
Cause they, they had horizon chase turbo yesterday, which is a pretty good one.

393
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:18,280
Um, and usually the December 25th one, I think, and the, um, very last one are usually like they gave away the entire Tomb Raider trilogy last year, if I remember right.

394
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,360
So I'm hoping there'll be a big one that I don't have yet that they'll give away.

395
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,520
Um, but I was bringing up the Epic store and I was like, Oh, I don't think I've played Tetris effect since I got this newer computer and the 4k monitor and everything.

396
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,840
It was very pretty.

397
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,920
I was, I was very happy.

398
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,600
I fired that up.

399
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,400
I was like, Oh, this is, this is nice comfort food.

400
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,760
As far as game goes, I love some Tetris effect.

401
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,240
I, I really hope there's another one.

402
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,440
We haven't really heard about what, um, Mizuguchi is working on now.

403
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,080
Have we?

404
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,080
So he's kind of, I would assume he's working on another Tetris effect game.

405
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,680
Like the last one was huge, but I don't know.

406
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,920
I guess nothing's for sure in that department.

407
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,400
Who knows?

408
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,040
So, all right.

409
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,760
Otherwise that was pretty much my gaming week.

410
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,040
So we will move on and let's get into some news from the week.

411
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,160
Loki, what's going on in video game news.

412
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,960
You must finally do it.

413
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,120
He's going to make a movie about death Stranding.

414
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,560
And it's going to have a different story, which is interesting.

415
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,480
It's going to be set around a different set of characters, but still in the same universe.

416
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,400
And that's good because I don't understand what the hell's going on in Death Stranding.

417
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,560
So it'll be, it'll be nice when they dumb it down.

418
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,400
You actually have to play the game to understand a little bit, at least.

419
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,240
I mean, that is true that that would probably help.

420
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,720
It would help.

421
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,000
But yes, so he's finally going to be working on a movie in partnership

422
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,760
with Kajima Productions and barbarian executive producer,

423
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,440
Alex Leibovitchis, Hammerstone Studios.

424
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,280
Didn't really go into much detail there.

425
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,280
Then it's going to have new elements and characters.

426
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,400
Basically saying we're thrilled and honored to have an opportunity

427
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,080
to partner with the brilliant and iconic Hideo Kojima in his first film adaptation.

428
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,000
Unlike other big budget tentpole video game adaptions,

429
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,280
this will be something far more intimate and grounded.

430
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,640
Our I'm sorry, the game is not grounded at all.

431
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,560
Our goal is to redefine what video game adaptations could be

432
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,080
when you have the creative and artistic freedom.

433
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,960
This will be a film that's authentic Hideo Kojima production.

434
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,160
It's going to be insane.

435
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,240
He's not going to be able to make a two and a half hour movie.

436
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,880
He's not. He's he's not.

437
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,400
It's going to be like, oh, we had to split it into two movies.

438
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,280
Like, there's no way. No way.

439
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,800
I will go see it.

440
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,240
It's going to because it's going to be crazy.

441
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,640
Zen Monkey Eleven says, give me the release date of that movie

442
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,760
so I can plan to do something else that weekend.

443
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,520
Well, who's to say it's going to be in theaters?

444
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,600
I mean, I I honestly think the movie is going to be so long.

445
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,880
He ends up doing Netflix, Hulu, HBO, whatever it is show.

446
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,480
So I think it ends up becoming a series, to be quite honest.

447
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,840
But we'll see. We'll see. Who knows?

448
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,480
So Tiger on chat says they need to get Norman Reedus involved.

449
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,160
Well, he's going to be in the sequel.

450
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,720
So and I wonder if this doesn't tie into this because the sequel,

451
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,480
I don't see how it can be.

452
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,440
I mean, I don't know.

453
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,000
There's a lot of weird places they could go with the sequel,

454
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,680
but they're obviously putting Norman Reedus in it.

455
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,400
So it's interesting.

456
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,600
Yeah. Well, let's see, I guess. Yeah.

457
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,560
Let's see. Fifth Dream says the movie will be generated in engine

458
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,040
and cost seventy dollars to play on PlayStation five.

459
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,920
I don't know if you can screen it at the cinema if it does that.

460
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,800
Who knows? As Joan Hunter Matt says, yeah, he can't fit it

461
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,080
in a two to three hour movie.

462
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,960
I feel like a Death Stranding series would have been good on HBO Max.

463
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,080
But let's be real.

464
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,160
But WB Discovery isn't making that happen.

465
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,160
No, that's that's true. How about Disney Plus?

466
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,560
How about Death Stranding on Disney Plus?

467
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,560
All right, let's move on.

468
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:57,240
Let's talk about what I mentioned Tomb Raider during the epic game store

469
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,960
giveaways and Tomb Raider is going to be continuing.

470
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,040
You know, we haven't we haven't heard a lot out of the series in a little bit,

471
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,400
and that's likely because they are going to start a new trilogy

472
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,800
or do something new with it.

473
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,000
But it has been confirmed that Crystal Dynamics is working on

474
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,440
Lara Croft's biggest and most expansive adventure yet

475
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,040
because it's being built in Unreal Engine five.

476
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,880
Oh, that was something they had said before.

477
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,440
They're making it in Unreal Engine five.

478
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,720
I do remember that when they announced Unreal Engine.

479
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,560
But now what we've learned is that Amazon is going to be publishing it.

480
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,080
So Crystal Dynamics is developing.

481
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,320
Amazon is publishing and Unreal Engine five is being used.

482
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,880
It's still a few years out, but it is going to come to multiple platforms.

483
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,080
Amazon does say it will have all of the franchise's hallmarks.

484
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,400
So I'm assuming that means the elaborate death scenes

485
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,280
that are a part of Lara Croft's no good, very bad day.

486
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,240
I'm assuming we're going to still see some of that in the game. We'll see.

487
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,000
It's it's not going to be a remake either.

488
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,720
So it's continuing Laura's story as well.

489
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,200
It's not a new reboot.

490
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,120
So I guess it's not really a new trilogy, but maybe a continuation trilogy.

491
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,520
I guess I guess it's the Scream four or the Scream five,

492
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,280
even of the Lara Croft Tomb Raider recent games. I don't know.

493
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,920
But anyway, even though Embracer

494
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,720
got the intellectual property rights to Tomb Raider and so forth,

495
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,520
this is just, you know, Crystal Dynamics has made the agreement with Amazon

496
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,240
for this. In a statement, the head of the studio, Scott Amos, said,

497
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,560
Crystal Dynamics has an extraordinary opportunity following our acquisition

498
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,760
by Embracer to redefine what a publishing relationship is for Tomb Raider.

499
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,720
Transformative is what we're looking for.

500
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,880
And with Amazon Games, we found a team that shares our creative vision,

501
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,560
ambitions and values for a Lara Croft universe across the spectrum

502
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,720
of possibilities.

503
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,720
They're uniquely positioned to rewrite what publishing and development

504
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,440
collaborations are, and we're eager to forge this new path together,

505
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,320
starting with building the biggest and best Tomb Raider game yet.

506
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,560
And of course, we know that's all the fluff speak.

507
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,880
We need to see what the game really looks like to be convinced.

508
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,920
Although, you know,

509
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,320
Amazon's got a cloud service that you probably forgot about.

510
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,520
They have their Luna services out there.

511
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,040
Wouldn't it be a smart thing for them to do if they were to put like the demo?

512
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,800
I'm not saying they have to release the game on Luna.

513
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,120
I mean, they should.

514
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,960
But even just put the demo.

515
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,760
If you want people just just to check out Luna, put the first demo

516
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,400
on the cloud service for just like a couple of days before you put on PS

517
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,600
fires, I'm telling you,

518
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,840
people will check out Luna just to fire up that demo and play it.

519
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,160
I think I think that would be a smart idea.

520
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,840
But I've also said on a previous episode,

521
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,720
I believe Amazon to be an extremely siloed company right now.

522
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,160
So I'm not expecting it to happen.

523
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,160
It's just, you know, what I what I need them to get dead by daylight.

524
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,560
Oh, yes, right. Luna doesn't have that, huh?

525
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,960
So that was so that way.

526
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,520
I won't have to use.

527
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,000
I mean, this story is great, just not the most stable of connections.

528
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,040
Yeah. And, you know, you would think that Amazon has a good relationship

529
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,840
with behavior because you see all the giveaways and Amazon Prime gaming

530
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,200
or whatever it's called,

531
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,320
which, again, why that is completely separate from Luna.

532
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,160
I don't understand.

533
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,840
But Amazon is siloed clearly.

534
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,480
So it's just weird.

535
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,840
So anyway.

536
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,360
Fifth Dream in chat says, is anything an Unreal Engine

537
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,440
five besides homebrew demos?

538
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,880
Give it a little more time.

539
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,520
You know, it takes a couple of years to make a triple A game.

540
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,760
And that's why you're seeing the small stuffs coming out relatively fast.

541
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,360
The things don't need a couple of years,

542
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,560
but it's going to take a couple of years in the oven

543
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,640
until you start seeing the fruits of this.

544
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,320
You know, things like Tomb Raider and so forth.

545
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,360
And I'm going to guess.

546
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,720
They're going to need to be able to get away from the Xbox S.

547
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,840
To do this, I think the Xbox S and let's be real, the PlayStation

548
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,120
four are also kind of holding because right now

549
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:56,600
most games still release on like PlayStation four.

550
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,200
And pretty much Microsoft has a mandate that everything that they release on

551
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,080
X has to release on S.

552
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,280
And I think there's going to come a time when that gets separated,

553
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,840
probably whenever Microsoft releases a Y or a Z or whatever they call it.

554
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,440
I don't know.

555
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,360
But they're probably going to stop supporting the S in the same way

556
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,280
at that point.

557
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,000
Now, for those of you that own an S,

558
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,920
I don't think you'll be screwed because enter Microsoft's

559
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,640
cloud will absolutely be functional on the S.

560
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,600
And that's how they'll continue to let you play a lot of those games.

561
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,560
That's you know, they haven't said anything.

562
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,440
That's just, you know.

563
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,400
Fortune teller Rob here,

564
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,000
but I don't see how they don't do that for the future.

565
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,520
We'll see.

566
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,240
Dartesuya also points out they had the Matrix Universe demo.

567
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,520
Yeah, that was the big showy offy thing for Unreal Engine five, for sure.

568
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,440
Dijirama says, I legit think that Microsoft could update the firmware

569
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,040
to handle 4K on the Xbox Series S.

570
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,360
Maybe, but is it going to run like Portal RTX?

571
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,720
Because then maybe don't.

572
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,280
Maybe don't.

573
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,840
But maybe give people the option.

574
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,360
They have the option on a PC game.

575
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,240
Give people the option.

576
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,360
No, I like that idea.

577
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,320
All right, moving on, Dark Sakura.

578
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,360
So I'm sure anyone who's been following

579
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,560
what I've been playing recently knows I've been playing Final Fantasy five

580
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,920
and I am not playing the Pixel remasters.

581
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,240
But certainly a good number of my friends have been playing the Pixel remasters.

582
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,880
Like I know Le Pen was playing through the Final Fantasy games.

583
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,160
And there will be a limited standard

584
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,560
and then a 35th anniversary special edition

585
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,600
Final Fantasy Pixel remaster, which is one through six.

586
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,480
And the anniversary edition actually looks pretty stellar.

587
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,840
It's coming to PS4 and Switch in 2023.

588
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,400
This comes with a bunch of shit. It's awesome. I kind of want it.

589
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,640
It is going to be for the standard is $74.99

590
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,680
and that's a Squenix store exclusive.

591
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:07,160
And then the the big anniversary bundle, also an exclusive, is $259.99.

592
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:12,160
Now, the standard comes with the one through six Pixel remaster collection,

593
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,560
which is a physical copy of all the games for PS4 or Switch.

594
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,160
And then the the really super deluxe, awesome version

595
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,160
has the physical copies again, anniversary edition, a goodie box,

596
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,360
a bonus lenticular sleeve for the game package,

597
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,520
a two disc vinyl record set with arranged game music

598
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,600
and the cover artwork done by Shibuya Kazuko.

599
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,120
Compiled art books showing the pixel art

600
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,880
and then eight pixel art style characters in window packaging.

601
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,200
It's looking pretty, pretty hardcore epic.

602
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,360
That's a lot of a lot of good stuff that comes with that.

603
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,000
Um, the pins are also like super cute.

604
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,840
You've got like your your white mage and your black mage

605
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,200
and you've got some characters from the other games.

606
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,120
You got your fighter and all of that.

607
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,280
And it's looking it's looking pretty nice.

608
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,000
I think I could I think it's already gone.

609
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,880
I think that is it.

610
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,360
Yeah, because I know the pre-order the sorry, the orders just started.

611
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,880
Yeah, no, Shane is complaining in chat.

612
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,160
Shadley Lin's in our chat saying, putting the physical copies

613
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,760
up in the middle of the night, charging twenty five bucks for shipping

614
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,240
and making them only available through their online store is just garbage.

615
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,040
Screw Square Enix for how they're handling the pixel remasters for consoles.

616
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,840
So and Dark Tetsuya says, I'm seriously hoping for individual digital releases.

617
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,520
I hope it's not exclusive to this limited physical edition.

618
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,280
Oh, I don't square would literally be leaving money on the table.

619
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,560
They have to have a digital option somewhere.

620
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,920
I would be I would be flabbergasted.

621
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,960
You're not buying it?

622
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,240
No, I have the original.

623
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,840
Why would I want the remasters?

624
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,360
They're cute, I don't know.

625
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,520
I understand they're a little pricey.

626
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,760
I don't think I would pay this high ticket price for all the collectors stuff

627
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,240
for them, but I enjoyed the four remaster.

628
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:20,680
I have so many copies of four on different items.

629
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,280
And then I have like the PlayStation collection

630
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,360
and I have the cartridges for everything,

631
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,080
not to mention, you know, other ways of playing them.

632
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:37,800
I don't see the pixel remasters would be like if someone had no access

633
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,680
to the original cartridges and wanted to play something

634
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,800
that looks kind of like the original did.

635
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,000
Also, the high risk pixels kind of freak me out.

636
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,760
I need I need them to be old school.

637
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,440
I need my old pixels.

638
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,280
I will say this, especially if they do piecemeal them.

639
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,640
I think you could make a case.

640
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,600
Well, there's no right or wrong answer.

641
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,400
Every gamer makes their own choice of their purchases.

642
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,200
But I think there could be a stronger case for specifically Final Fantasy three.

643
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,840
And Jason kind of referenced in the intro there tonight

644
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,480
that technically Final Fantasy three has never been released in the U.S.

645
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,800
in two dimensions.

646
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,120
The very first time we got Final Fantasy three was that

647
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,600
3D DS.

648
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,960
Well, there was the it was DS first, and then the iOS version came after that.

649
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,920
And so we've only ever really had it in its 3D form.

650
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,320
It was even on the Ouya in the 3D form.

651
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,840
Remember that that was a big deal because Square Enix put something on the Ouya.

652
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,040
It was Final Fantasy three.

653
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,800
So this is the first time we've had it in two dimensions.

654
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,240
And that means the first time with an official English translation.

655
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,600
Anyway, in two dimensions.

656
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:42,200
So I would say that one in particular, I think has the strongest case going for it.

657
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:46,320
Because I if you don't really care for the 3D ones, I don't I

658
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,760
I don't know. I could kind of give or take them.

659
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,040
I understand the perks for Final Fantasy four in the 3D.

660
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,600
And some people were really into it.

661
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,640
I still think the best version of Final Fantasy four was the one they did on the PSP.

662
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,480
Was it the PS Vita?

663
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,960
It was what it was the PSP.

664
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,480
The best one is the original.

665
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,320
Yeah, that's everyone's entitled to their opinion.

666
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,720
But I love the one on the PSP.

667
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,840
So if you ones are good.

668
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,240
But I guess but I also understand the originals absolutely have their charm,

669
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,600
especially, you know, when you compare the Japanese original original

670
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,760
to what they actually released in the US, which was, you know,

671
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,200
Final Fantasy, easy mode,

672
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,400
which is all I ever knew for years through the Japanese one.

673
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,000
Yeah. Yeah. When I did my thing, just it was a translated

674
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,280
Japanese rom.

675
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,320
And it had like all the censorship fixed and everything.

676
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,560
And the original dialogue is closely translated as possible.

677
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,760
Like the spoonie Bard line was more like you son of a bitch.

678
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,840
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it was a lot harsher.

679
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:54,400
Um, as to show 100, Matt says there's a rumor they're going to fix the font

680
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,280
in these versions for Switch and PS4.

681
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,280
That is the by far and wide, the biggest problem with the pixel remasters

682
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,520
is the font sucks.

683
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,040
It's going to especially suck on a large TV

684
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,640
if you're sitting on the in the back of the room.

685
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,800
So I do hope that is true, that they're looking at redoing those fonts.

686
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,000
I really I really hope that's more than just a rumor.

687
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,840
But that's probably at the top of people's wish list there.

688
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,160
And going into chat for some other comments.

689
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,800
Shadley Lynn Shane says the regular edition is gone.

690
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,040
The collector's edition is still up for like 260 before shipping.

691
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,160
Yeah, no, I'm not paying that.

692
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,800
That's what I said.

693
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,560
No, I just I'm not.

694
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,040
It's too much, too much.

695
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,360
But I mean, it's a lot of cool crap, but it's yeah, I don't need it.

696
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,400
Shadley Lynn also says, I just want a physical cart for the switch for them.

697
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,440
And that's true, and Matt says same.

698
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,920
I think I might get the PlayStation version. I don't know.

699
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,760
I kind of I kind of love trophies.

700
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,720
I don't know. I just I that's kind of what I want.

701
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,040
I don't. But I also don't do a lot of portable gaming.

702
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,520
And I know some of you all do a lot more gaming on the go.

703
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,720
Even the switch stuff I end up playing on my monitor or my TV.

704
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,200
So it's, you know, whatever.

705
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,280
But I'm glad they're finally coming.

706
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,200
It took them long enough to announce this.

707
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,600
I really would have thought this would have been like a year ago.

708
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,720
So it's about time, I guess.

709
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,640
All right. Moving on, Loki.

710
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:20,440
All right, well, Epic is shutting down some older game servers

711
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,240
for games you may recognize.

712
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,800
Many, unfortunately, happen to be harmonics games.

713
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,840
So we have that central one, two and three

714
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,080
are all being shut down as well as numerous rock band games.

715
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,320
So we have Green Day, rock band, rock band one, two and three.

716
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,400
The Beatles rock band all being shut down.

717
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,880
And then, of course, with unreal gold, unreal to the awakening,

718
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,800
unreal tournament 2003, 2004 and unreal tournament three

719
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:58,040
and unreal tournament game of the year edition as well.

720
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,480
And then there's some other random ones there and their supersonic

721
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,560
acrobatic rocket powered battle cars.

722
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,000
Great name. Monsters probably stole my princess

723
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,080
as well being shut down and 1000 tiny claws.

724
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,840
Those are all being shut down, though.

725
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,880
January 24th of 2023.

726
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,800
So play online while you can.

727
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,880
Rock band four is going to still be online, though.

728
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,400
And the dance central VR

729
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,320
online multiplayer will remain available for now.

730
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,800
I didn't even know that dance central VR was a thing.

731
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,840
I did not either.

732
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,080
Now to be on like it's it's sad to hear that these are going offline.

733
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,680
But to be honest, I kind of assume they already were like.

734
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,280
I thought they had the servers for Rock Band two and three,

735
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,440
like not long after four is released.

736
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,320
So I was like, oh, they're even still up and running.

737
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,960
That's cool. But yeah, it's still it's still hits

738
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,120
in the end of the end of an era type of way, I suppose.

739
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,600
Yeah. And there are a few more things, too.

740
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:03,000
So also, apparently players are going to lose access

741
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,120
to the following titles on their removal dates as well.

742
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,600
Battle Breakers is going to be removed December 30th,

743
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,680
and they're going to refund players for any in-game purchases

744
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:17,360
made via epic direct payments 108 days prior to today.

745
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,080
Unreal Tournament Alpha is being shut down January 24th.

746
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:27,360
Rock Band Blitz on January 24th and the Rock Band companion app.

747
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,280
Also January 24th in sync space on January 24th.

748
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,480
Man, I wish Rock Band Blitz would come back.

749
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,680
Such a good game. It's a bummer.

750
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,600
Um, let's see.

751
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,240
S200 Matt says keeping the servers going for 20 years

752
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,640
on some of those unreal games is pretty generous, to be honest.

753
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,520
I'm kind of bummed and also surprised.

754
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,920
Unreal Tournament 2004.

755
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,240
That was my big multiplayer game in my college years.

756
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,280
What I'm surprised most about is that the servers were still running.

757
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,440
Yeah, this is kind of kind of.

758
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,240
Yeah. Oh, and they also this was probably impacts Jamie a little more,

759
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,640
but they apparently have removed the Mac

760
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,440
and Linux versions

761
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,600
of Hot Tofo Boyfriend and Hot Tofo Boyfriend Holiday Star.

762
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,040
I wonder why. That's weird.

763
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,280
No idea. They're old-ass games.

764
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,360
It's already, um,

765
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,960
compatibility for the first one for Mac and iOS have already been removed.

766
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,440
But I think they're still on Steam, though.

767
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,320
I think this is like epic, epic direct or something like that.

768
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,880
So maybe. Interesting. They are.

769
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,120
Speaking of harmonics, a reminder.

770
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,000
We kind of mentioned it in the parody bump, but that isn't on the podcast.

771
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,720
And I don't know, it might be too late by the time the podcast is out.

772
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,320
But reminder, Fusor's gone tomorrow, December 19th, which is Monday.

773
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,720
So and I don't know what time of day it gets pulled.

774
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,560
So it is I noticed it was 1999 on Steam.

775
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,000
And if you do own Fusor and you haven't done it yet

776
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,400
and you're listening live, do it now, because you'll forget otherwise.

777
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,560
Open the game and get the packs in the game that are like it's

778
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,960
it's the unlock everything for free.

779
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:05,760
So it unlocks every I don't think it unlocks the DLC songs, unfortunately.

780
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,520
But I think as far as like cosmetics, outfits, things like that,

781
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,480
somebody in chat can correct me if I'm wrong, but I was seeing

782
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,080
that was going around is that they have like a everything pack that's free.

783
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,760
And I think as far as, you know, again, like in in-game items

784
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,160
and that sort of thing, that's what they're giving away for free.

785
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,160
And you will not be able to access it after tomorrow because the store will be gone.

786
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:30,360
So just a reminder on that front, for those of you that own the game Fusor,

787
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,600
even if you think you'll never play it again, grab them just in case.

788
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,400
I think it's a good idea.

789
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,880
So, yeah, Zen Monkey 11 in chat says,

790
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,080
This is why I don't like to buy games with an online expiration date.

791
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,040
The refund thing is a great idea.

792
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:48,320
Well, the only the only time I think we've seen refunds is Stadia.

793
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,960
And Dark Soccer can attest to that.

794
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,080
And I think that's a that's a rarity.

795
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,360
Be honest, is a nice little rarity there.

796
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,320
It farted rainbows all over my bank account. Mm hmm.

797
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:05,160
Shane says it unlocks the the Fusor unlocks the diamond stuff,

798
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,640
which was on a rotation, I believe weekly.

799
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:11,040
It does include songs, but they are harmonics artist songs.

800
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,800
So, yeah, there's a there's a variety of free DLC

801
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,240
also in Steam, which I'm imagining is the same stuff.

802
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,280
So, yeah, I would grab everything you can before tomorrow's the end of Fusor.

803
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,840
So those that enjoyed that.

804
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:29,160
All right, let's move on and talk about this next story,

805
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,640
which has to do with Armored Core six,

806
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,760
which turned a lot of heads when it was announced at the Game Awards.

807
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,320
Armored Core six will have versus multiplayer.

808
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:42,400
I don't know if you're excited about that, Loki, but I know you're a fan of Max.

809
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,920
And yeah, well, and I'm excited about this and what what it you know,

810
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,240
what it won't have is souls like gameplay that is being confirmed as well.

811
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,520
So it's, you know, a different series,

812
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,680
even though from software is no one of the stuff, though, I think.

813
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,200
I don't know about that.

814
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,600
But anyway, IGN had an interview with Yamamura,

815
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,880
who is the I believe the executive producer of the game.

816
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,640
He's saying, yes, we do plan to have a versus mode similar to previous

817
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,000
armed core titles where you'll be able to customize your mech

818
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,000
and take that fully customized mech into battle with others.

819
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:20,520
But we will reveal more details about this at a later date.

820
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,800
But also being said, story mode is the priority for this

821
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,400
versus is going to be a separate thing.

822
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,760
Multiplayer will not be part of the story.

823
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:34,840
So even though in armor, excuse me, armored core five,

824
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,960
there were more multiplayer options, such as teams of 20

825
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,400
facing off to defend and take territory.

826
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,360
So we'll see what comes of that.

827
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,560
Twenty twenty three is the anticipated release of armored core six fires

828
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,960
of Rubicon, PS4, PS5, Xbox series

829
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,320
and Xbox one even and PC via steam.

830
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:59,240
The last release was 2012 was armored cord five.

831
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,440
So it's been some time if you weren't aware for these games.

832
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,800
All right, let's move on.

833
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,120
I think we're to Dark Sakura.

834
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,880
Believe that we are.

835
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,320
And this is

836
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,600
I think a long time coming.

837
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,000
Well, by a long time, I mean things that people have really pushed for.

838
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,640
Twitch had basically added in a bunch of charities

839
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,520
that were based off of items

840
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,480
approved by PayPal Giving Fund.

841
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:41,720
And among them was one called the LGB Alliance, which for

842
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:46,280
for all even what its name implies, it is actually an anti trans

843
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,480
hate group.

844
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:54,280
And so with a lot of push from other Twitch users and a big

845
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:59,480
just upvote on one of their remove hate group

846
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:03,400
forum posts that received over 16000 upvotes,

847
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,800
Twitch said that they removed it and they're quoted with this.

848
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,000
Twitch does not allow charities that violate our hateful conduct policies

849
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,040
on Twitch, whose organization and leadership engage

850
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:21,320
in or promote behaviors that violate our office service policy.

851
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,760
Inclusion on this list is not an endorsement from Twitch.

852
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,320
Also, it says, however, we regularly review the list

853
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:34,680
and remove organizations that violate our policies.

854
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,480
There are still a few over there,

855
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,600
and it's pretty clear there's not like a true vetting process for any of these.

856
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,920
I think it's just a mass approval, again, based on whatever

857
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,160
PayPal Giving approves.

858
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,920
But at the very least, it's it's a response.

859
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,680
Maybe they'll they'll take it to heart more for the future.

860
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,320
Yeah. And if I believe correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe

861
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:03,680
LGB Alliance is more based in the UK as well.

862
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,000
I only heard of it when I was on Twitter and I'm not there anymore.

863
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,360
But I also know that Lady Voldemort probably was involved with that somehow,

864
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,800
because you know how she is, unfortunately.

865
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,040
And it's just it's obviously like as somebody who is G,

866
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,360
it's just really gross that you would not support RT,

867
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,320
you know, brothers and sisters and siblings, because like it's

868
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,600
we're all in it together.

869
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,320
And it's just I do not understand that mentality whatsoever.

870
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,480
And it's really gross.

871
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,480
Well, divided will fall. Yeah, right.

872
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,480
It's really gross with the organization pushes.

873
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,520
So it's just, you know, I used to see some of that crap on Twitter

874
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,360
just because, you know, usually it was, quote, tweets of people dragging them

875
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,040
and the other things like that, which, you know, you're still amplifying it.

876
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:44,920
So I wish you wouldn't do that.

877
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,240
But, you know, it's

878
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,320
I just hope nobody I know would be involved with something like that,

879
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,720
because we're we're, you know, trans men are men and trans women are women.

880
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,800
And we're all in this together.

881
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,440
And it's just, yeah, it's and and being

882
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,200
non-binary is a true thing, of course. Yeah.

883
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,560
So, yeah, you you are who you are, be your true self.

884
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:13,120
And if anybody says that that you're not valid, kick him in the shin really hard.

885
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,840
Agree. All right.

886
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,680
I don't normally advocate for violence, but you see how that feels.

887
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,080
That's how I feel emotionally.

888
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,480
So shut the fuck up, sit down and drink your goddamn tea.

889
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,280
You know what? I bet Argentina kicked a lot of shins today.

890
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,280
So you know what?

891
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,760
It is what it is. All right.

892
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,240
Moving on, let's get into it.

893
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,320
And that was that was a soccer joke or a football joke for the rest of the world.

894
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,520
OK, I quoted Sid from Final Fantasy seven. All right.

895
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,880
Moving on. Where are we at?

896
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:49,360
Loki. So Guerrilla Games has confirmed that they are working on an online

897
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,880
adaptation or online project in the Horizon universe.

898
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,120
It's being worked on.

899
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,680
I guess they are advertising open positions

900
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,480
in their Amsterdam office.

901
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:08,240
And yeah, it says we're looking for talented people for Horizon single player.

902
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,200
Online project and external project teams.

903
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,120
So no word on what that is yet, but

904
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,120
maybe another live service game.

905
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,960
Yay. Oh, boy.

906
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,680
We'll have to see, I guess.

907
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,920
But it's there's there's something coming.

908
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,240
I think you're right on the money. It's a live service game.

909
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:37,000
They want they want something that can keep on giving in that regard.

910
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,520
So I haven't, you know, wasn't good enough for Sony to purchase,

911
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,520
you know, Destiny. We got to have more destiny.

912
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,120
Well, one series you can get more and more of.

913
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,760
In fact, this series has been going a long time.

914
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,440
I remember playing these games.

915
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,440
I think these originated

916
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,040
their soccer may have to correct me here because it was a CD based system

917
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,160
and I didn't have it back in the day. I want to say it was on.

918
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:04,800
Maybe Turbo, I don't remember, but it's Ease series.

919
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,320
Oh, yeah. Ease.

920
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,400
The Ease games were

921
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,680
also Super Nintendo.

922
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,160
Yeah, I remember them on Super Nintendo,

923
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,440
but I don't think that's where it started.

924
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,720
They started on a CD based system, didn't they?

925
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,720
I am. I'm pretty sure that PC and that, well,

926
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:26,240
the first Ease Books one and two came out on PC Engine.

927
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,240
I have to I'll have to do a little bit of digging

928
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:33,680
because I think that first two came out individually on MSX.

929
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,240
I'm going to say, yeah.

930
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,120
I know it was done by Nihan Falcom.

931
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,600
Yeah, S2100 Matt says PC Engine CD ROM in 1989 and Turbo Graphics CD.

932
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,680
That's that sounds right.

933
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,320
I think it was a Turbo Graphics thing here. So.

934
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,160
Yeah, it was actually it was the PC 8801.

935
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,720
OK, that was it.

936
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,560
I remembered it was on one of the computer systems and I wanted to say

937
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,080
MSX, but no, it was the NEC PC 8801.

938
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,640
Well, here we are all these years later, and the series is still going.

939
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:10,040
By the way, I there are a lot of people that think this is called Wise

940
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,880
because it's capital Y, lowercase s.

941
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,080
And so there's a lot of people that call this series wise.

942
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,920
So it's easy. Yeah.

943
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,760
Even even I know that pronunciation.

944
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,640
That's telling you something.

945
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,960
It's been a gamey for a long time as a child.

946
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,280
Yeah, no, I didn't know it when I was younger either.

947
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,760
So it is what it is.

948
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:32,200
So East or wise to our childhood self is still going.

949
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:35,680
And East is up to come out, by the way, on MSX, too.

950
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,320
Just saying, that's why I was thinking of it.

951
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,480
Yeah, they poured in a lot of those.

952
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:45,400
But the first game in its original release didn't come out on PC Engine,

953
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:50,640
on what we know as the PC Engine until it was a compilation with one and two.

954
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,040
Got it. Well, they're on their 10th game now.

955
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:57,280
And actually, the 10th game is East 10 or is X.

956
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:01,640
Nordics was released on the PlayStation four in 2019.

957
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:08,120
It was is announced, though, that it will be coming out for more platforms in 2023.

958
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,440
This is in celebration of the 35th anniversary of the series.

959
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:16,040
So it's going to be coming out for the I think the Nintendo Switch

960
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,800
will actually be getting that as well.

961
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,840
The Nintendo Switch is also going to get E's memoir.

962
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,280
The Oath in Felghana.

963
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:29,040
This is a deepened action RPG, and they're calling this a definitive edition.

964
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,840
This was originally released for the PSP in 2010.

965
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,320
So this is one that would be pretty hard to get your hands on in 2022,

966
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,720
but it will be coming out for the Switch.

967
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:42,240
And this is this is considered one of the better games in the series.

968
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:47,240
And they've also added voiceovers for the protagonist in the game,

969
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,840
who's going to be voiced by Yukikaji.

970
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,920
It will have a narration by Banju Ginja

971
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,680
and an even more dramatic story, thanks to the voiceovers.

972
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,000
So that's pretty cool.

973
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,880
Also, refined versions of the illustrations

974
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,040
for the characters during the story have been created.

975
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:07,240
The classic versions for PSP and PC will also be included.

976
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,960
You can switch between refined and classic.

977
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,600
Continuing on with that for the Switch, apparently the same is also true

978
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,880
of the soundtrack, so you can actually flip back and forth.

979
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,640
So if you are, you know, you only want the classic version, you can do that.

980
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,720
So that's pretty cool.

981
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:27,920
So, yeah, a series you might have forgotten about,

982
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,160
but it's been a lot been around for a very long time.

983
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,240
That's a series I got to catch up on sometime.

984
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,240
I remember I had a lot of fun on Wanderers from Ys.

985
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,800
Yeah, the fourth one.

986
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,800
I remember playing one of them on Super Nintendo.

987
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,720
I didn't particularly enjoy it at the time,

988
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,600
but my tastes have changed a lot as I got older.

989
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,640
I would I'd be very curious to revisit it.

990
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,000
Some want to say that the first one on Super Nintendo was Wanderers from Ys.

991
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,120
It probably was. Yeah, I think it was these three. Yeah.

992
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,920
It had like some of my favorite music in it, though,

993
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,480
and I beat that game pretty hard.

994
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,560
Well, while we're on the subject of classic games,

995
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,280
there's no better time than now for this.

996
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,960
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time

997
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,280
or I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

998
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,360
It's time for the classic game of the week.

999
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,200
And what did you pick tonight, Dark Sakura?

1000
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,320
Picked Final Fantasy X-2.

1001
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,800
And I had to make sure I hadn't done it yet, and I haven't.

1002
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:45,240
So and for the record, I picked the good version with the music by Kotakumi,

1003
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,320
because honestly, I like her voice a hell of a lot better.

1004
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:54,840
And that and I actually still know the lyrics to all the songs,

1005
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,120
and I've never bothered learning them in English.

1006
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,920
And also, you know, it's like with anything,

1007
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,480
you always like the first version that you played,

1008
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,400
and I imported this like right away.

1009
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:12,640
So Final Fantasy X-2 came out in 2003.

1010
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,760
It is a role playing video game.

1011
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,000
It was developed by Square for PS2,

1012
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,600
and it's actually one of the first examples

1013
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:29,360
of a sequel to an in-universe Final Fantasy game,

1014
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,640
as in typically in the past, they were all standalone.

1015
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,760
And this one was an actual sequel.

1016
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,880
So this one is Yuna looking for

1017
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,320
Tidus, who was the hero from the game before,

1018
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:51,200
and also fighting political hardship while looking for these spheres

1019
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,880
that give them all kinds of magical girl transformation,

1020
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,160
dress up powers for fun.

1021
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:02,240
And it's also the first one to have an all female cast

1022
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,720
and have just three player characters.

1023
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:10,600
And it does harken back to earlier Final Fantasy games

1024
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,120
where you had your character classes and job leveling.

1025
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:18,160
And it also is one of the few

1026
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,880
Final Fantasy games that has multiple endings.

1027
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,720
The soundtrack is amazing.

1028
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:31,120
It was done by Matsueira Noriko and Eguchi Takahito

1029
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,840
instead of Uematsu.

1030
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:39,200
But I mean, Uematsu is amazing, but this soundtrack is pretty damn amazing, too.

1031
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,760
And it was pretty successful.

1032
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,600
I mean, it sold over 5.4 million copies on PS2,

1033
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:50,440
won a bunch of awards, and it was the last Final Fantasy

1034
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:55,720
game to be released by Square before they merged with Enix in April 2003.

1035
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:00,560
It was re-released in high def as Final Fantasy 10

1036
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,280
slash 10 to HD remaster,

1037
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,000
which also came out on PlayStation 4 in 2015,

1038
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,760
Windows in 2016, and Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in 2019.

1039
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,680
And as of September 2021,

1040
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:18,000
the Final Fantasy 10 series had sold over

1041
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,800
20.8 million units worldwide.

1042
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:27,560
And it was even just by March 2022, it surpassed 21.1 million.

1043
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:34,840
So the game is set in the same universe, of course, as 10.

1044
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,800
It is set in the world of Spira.

1045
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,720
This is two years after the events for Final Fantasy 10.

1046
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:46,320
And of course, with their major religion having been completely

1047
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,360
you know, table flipped,

1048
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,320
they are picking up the pieces with the younger group

1049
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:56,680
going the way of technology and the older people

1050
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,640
trying to recreate their Yevon religion.

1051
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,520
And so and then, of course, there's another group

1052
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,480
that's selling tech to both sides to try to kill each other.

1053
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,000
But throughout all of this,

1054
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:16,520
there is a character spirit who is woken up

1055
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:22,800
and possesses certain people to try to end Spira

1056
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:29,480
because of how he and his lover, Len, died.

1057
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:34,040
In the Japanese version, by the way, Len was voiced by Kotokumi,

1058
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:38,400
who sang all the songs, which I think is awesome.

1059
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,760
But at any rate, a lot of the characters from the previous

1060
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,840
Final Fantasy 10 showed up as supporting roles

1061
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,880
like Brother, Waka, and Lulu.

1062
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,600
There were other new characters introduced,

1063
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:01,480
like there was the LeBlanc Syndicate,

1064
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:04,040
the faction leaders, other Spira hunters.

1065
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,760
And then, of course,

1066
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,040
this is the main antagonist is Eshuin,

1067
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,000
who is the spirit of a soldier that died

1068
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,160
during the Makino War a thousand years before.

1069
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:25,440
So it's for the seriousness of the story,

1070
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,720
there is a lot of lightheartedness that goes with it.

1071
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,680
And I think that there is definitely that message

1072
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:40,440
of dealing with lost love and grief that that really appealed to me.

1073
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,480
And with maybe a little bit of self-exploration through changing,

1074
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:51,200
you know, I have seen the dressphere as a sort of like

1075
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,800
trying on a new identity until you find the one that fits.

1076
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,800
I mean, I don't know if that makes sense or not,

1077
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,920
but that's kind of how I saw it.

1078
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,320
No, it totally does.

1079
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,840
Yeah. And I mean, especially since Yuna herself,

1080
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,440
her whole identity had been wrapped up in being a summoner

1081
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,000
and then there's nothing to summon.

1082
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:14,360
Well, in general, this is where her life is going,

1083
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,600
what she's done to give it purpose.

1084
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:21,560
I mean, she totally expected to die in the first game, you know?

1085
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,680
So at any rate,

1086
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:32,200
the development of this was in response to a fan reaction

1087
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:36,440
to the eternal calm that was in the Japanese version of Final Fantasy X

1088
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:40,000
International that showed Yuna's life after the game.

1089
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:45,000
So 10-2 was released

1090
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,520
shortly before the merger of Square and Enix,

1091
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:52,800
and they didn't really care for the name 10-2,

1092
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:56,080
but they just took it because it's a sequel and it worked.

1093
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:04,120
It also were, and this is actually Nojima Kazushige,

1094
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:08,760
the previous game's writer was very skeptical about putting out a sequel,

1095
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,520
especially one with a happy ending, but

1096
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,920
they did it.

1097
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,720
They were given, according to Nomura,

1098
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,520
they were able to do the game in a year and a half

1099
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,360
at its standard scope because of all of the character models,

1100
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:36,920
the enemies and location designs that were still usable.

1101
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,520
And then as for most of the creation of this,

1102
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:44,040
it was done in Autodesk Maya and Soft Image 3D.

1103
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,600
I know Maya, and it's a pain in the ass to use.

1104
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:54,520
So they said that the objective, the producers and directors said that

1105
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,560
the objective when designing the game was to embrace

1106
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,640
the concept of change as the main theme,

1107
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,080
which is what I was bringing up before.

1108
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,760
And they did make it more upbeat.

1109
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,400
That's definitely what they wanted to do.

1110
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:12,320
They wanted to show what a drastic change was in Spira,

1111
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
because there's no summons, they redesigned to some of the towns,

1112
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,600
they included different vehicles,

1113
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,120
and they had different elements that came directly from Japanese pop culture.

1114
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:31,280
And then they wanted to bring in,

1115
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:38,600
they talked about bringing in Lulu as the third person instead of Pine,

1116
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:45,480
because she would have been more of like an older sister

1117
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:48,640
rather than Yuna being able to stand on her own feet.

1118
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,480
But they did give her a baby in the previous game.

1119
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,600
As far as the music goes, I mean, like I said,

1120
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,880
it has a little bit more of a pop feel to it,

1121
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:06,960
and the songs Real Emotion and Sen no Kotoba were done by Kotokumi.

1122
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:13,040
And she also did the motion capture for Yuna's dancing

1123
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,560
and did the voice for Len.

1124
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:21,920
Of course, the US one was done by Jade Villalon of Sweetbox,

1125
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:28,880
who released full versions of the songs for her Japanese release of Adagio.

1126
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:35,000
And Kotokumi released English versions of these on a CD single for Come With Me,

1127
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,040
although the translations for both are different.

1128
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,560
But I mean, there was merchandise for everything.

1129
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,640
There was so much.

1130
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,360
There was an expanded version,

1131
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,200
which is the Final Fantasy X-2 International and The Last Mission,

1132
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,160
that had two new dresspheres,

1133
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:01,040
additional last mission location at the Yadanoki Tower,

1134
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,960
and the ability to capture and battle different monsters.

1135
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,920
And it had Tidus, Aran, and Seymour from Final Fantasy X.

1136
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,720
It was not released outside of Japan,

1137
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,480
even though it had the English voice track to use for the majority of the story.

1138
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,000
But I have that copy.

1139
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:27,360
And there were action figures and books and soundtracks and art books

1140
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:32,840
and strategy guides and Ultimania guidebooks and all kinds of stuff.

1141
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:39,000
Horii, the peripheral gaming company,

1142
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:45,720
had controllers that were modeled after Yuna's Tiny Bee guns.

1143
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,360
These only came out in Japan.

1144
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,240
They were also re-released in the silver box

1145
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:54,360
with the release of The International and Last Mission.

1146
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,960
And then they also created a vertical stand for the PS2

1147
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:01,640
with the Final Fantasy X-2 logo that lights up in blue when it's plugged in.

1148
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:07,280
And so, of course, there was the HD version that came out.

1149
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:11,320
It worked with Kitase Yoshinori involved.

1150
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:21,040
And, you know, all of these releases of it were pretty well received.

1151
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,520
I mean, the soundtrack was kind of mixed

1152
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:28,840
because it kind of went on that J-pop front instead of with any input from Uematsu.

1153
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,440
EGM called it too bubbly, but what do they know?

1154
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,440
I mean, there's just way too many people that were complaining about

1155
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,160
missing the old guard.

1156
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:47,880
But the thing is that this game was meant to embody the new,

1157
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:52,680
you know, to indicate change, to show a change in the world,

1158
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:56,600
a change in people, personality, that type of thing.

1159
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,640
And so after this one came out,

1160
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:05,120
they finally did other direct sequels to Final Fantasy games,

1161
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,880
including Dirge of Cerberus and then Final Fantasy IV,

1162
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:13,120
The After Years, and two sequels to Final Fantasy XIII.

1163
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,880
I mean, this is the other problem that people had with this game,

1164
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,600
is that it was considered girly.

1165
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:28,080
And I think that the people who didn't like it because it was girly

1166
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,480
need to have their... I think that they're full of shit.

1167
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,320
So I'm not going to mince my words about it.

1168
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:41,800
But I really liked that with enough work,

1169
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:45,960
you could get a happy ending to this game.

1170
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:50,200
I mean, spoilers for how old game is this now?

1171
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:56,560
But in one of... there's actually two extra endings where one of them,

1172
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,360
you get Tidus back, like the Faith fully bring him back as a real boy.

1173
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,200
He's a real boy now.

1174
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:08,520
And then the other one, you have an extended conversation

1175
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,320
between him and Yuna and Zanarkand,

1176
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:16,440
where they talk about, you know, are you real?

1177
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:20,240
And it's like, well, yeah, as real as you think I am, I guess.

1178
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,440
You know, but it's a really interesting,

1179
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:28,160
you know, it's a very serious conversation for a lighthearted ending.

1180
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:34,400
But at any rate, I love this game.

1181
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:38,320
I much prefer the music in Japanese

1182
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,640
just because I was a big Kotokumi fan before this game came out.

1183
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:47,280
So I'm not going to say that the US,

1184
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,880
the English versions are bad.

1185
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:50,880
I mean, they're great.

1186
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,000
And if I had heard them first, I might have liked them better.

1187
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,360
But it is what it is.

1188
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,920
So that's why I wanted to put up the Japanese copy,

1189
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,760
because that's the version I like best.

1190
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:04,720
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Final Fantasy X-2.

1191
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,360
This is also interesting because I don't remember exactly

1192
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,520
the year this came out, but it must have been around 2013.

1193
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,560
It was 2013. It was really that far.

1194
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:15,800
I thought it was more around the time

1195
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:18,840
when this show had just started as a 2003.

1196
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,960
OK, I was going to say, I thought it was around the time

1197
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,840
this show started as a podcast.

1198
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:24,880
I don't know why I said 2013. It was 2003.

1199
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,480
Because I remember in an early episode of OLR,

1200
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:33,320
we were like, Jamie was saying it's 10-2 and I kept saying X-2.

1201
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,680
And I was like, you know what, I'm just going to email Square.

1202
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:40,520
And they actually wrote back and Square confirmed that it was 10-2

1203
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,080
is the correct pronunciation of it.

1204
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,440
So it was just is kind of kind of fun.

1205
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,240
I've been smug about it ever since.

1206
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,280
Yeah, let me tell you about it. Yeah.

1207
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:51,320
So no, but it's it's it's kind of, you know, neat.

1208
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,880
But it was it was certainly unconventional naming.

1209
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,800
Like, you know, there was a part of me that always wondered,

1210
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,640
why didn't they just make this Final Fantasy 11

1211
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,960
and call what ultimately was Final Fantasy 11 Final Fantasy Online?

1212
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:07,240
Because Final Fantasy 11 just doesn't feel like a standard Final Fantasy game.

1213
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,360
And so what? There's a few characters in common.

1214
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,440
But I understand ultimately what each world is its own.

1215
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,120
Yeah, I know.

1216
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:19,160
Especially think of it like the Marvel Universe, right? Right.

1217
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,320
The main universe is 616.

1218
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,720
And then there's, you know, all these other numbers.

1219
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:27,560
Well, and especially then when they started doing 13 and 13,

1220
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,920
two in the after years and all the other stuff you named in there,

1221
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:32,480
like, especially when they started getting into all that.

1222
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,080
Like, I understand why they did what they did.

1223
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:39,400
But yeah, I mean, you know, it's it's hard to understate

1224
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,680
just what a big deal it was that they were doing a sequel

1225
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:45,240
to a Final Fantasy game like this at the time. It was weird.

1226
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:50,080
But now it's less weird, very giddy and then being excited about importing it.

1227
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1228
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:56,520
So but but no, it's it's I mean, even to this day,

1229
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:59,360
I think as a game, it still holds up. Mm hmm.

1230
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,920
So confession, I've barely played it.

1231
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,600
I know this surprises people, but I've barely played it.

1232
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,640
I keep meaning to get around to the HD remaster, but I keep saying

1233
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:11,160
I'm not going to play it until I beat Final Fantasy 10.

1234
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:12,080
And we all know what happens.

1235
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,280
Of course, I don't because something shiny comes out of the international copy.

1236
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:19,360
I have the HD remasters, you know, which I think the newer ones,

1237
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:22,840
the HD remasters, do they have the newer ones are, I think.

1238
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,760
I think the original ones on PS3 weren't.

1239
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:31,040
But then the ones on PS4 were, I think. Don't hold me on that.

1240
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,480
So I'll have to go back and look.

1241
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,480
But I saw something.

1242
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,600
Where is it? There is one about the

1243
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:40,920
the other release.

1244
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,560
Here we go. The last mission.

1245
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,440
Did this change parts of the Japanese subtitles

1246
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,280
or change or alter to fit the voiceovers?

1247
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,960
This is detailed strategy book for the international version.

1248
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:58,560
It doesn't. I mean, they probably were,

1249
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,640
but it didn't say anything about it being included,

1250
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,320
but I wouldn't doubt that it was. Yeah.

1251
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,960
As Joe points out, they were on Game Pass until recently.

1252
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:06,880
I believe you're right.

1253
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,800
The Final Fantasy games were kind of a lot of them were cycling through,

1254
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,840
but they appear to only be good for a year because like Final Fantasy

1255
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,240
13 and 13 two are no longer there or like

1256
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:20,360
13 two is almost up as is lightning returns.

1257
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,720
So, yeah, they're kind of cycling through Game Pass, unfortunately.

1258
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,520
So you got to buy it at this point.

1259
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:30,400
But those I mean, they've been out a while and they go on sale frequently.

1260
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,880
So it's pretty easy to pick up whatever Final Fantasy HD game

1261
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:37,080
you want for 20 bucks if you just wait for the right sale.

1262
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:41,320
And considering we're coming up on all the storefront holiday sales,

1263
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,960
especially what Steam starts December 22nd, Epic just started.

1264
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:49,600
I'm sure PlayStation and Microsoft are going to set their sales

1265
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,000
before they leave the office next week, and then it'll be a sale for like two weeks.

1266
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,640
So. It's coming

1267
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,520
if you want to catch up on that stuff.

1268
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,040
All right. Great pick.

1269
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:04,240
I'm as surprised as anyone else that hadn't been picked already,

1270
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:08,240
but that happens sometimes some good ones slip through all of surprises.

1271
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,720
Yeah. All right.

1272
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:12,480
Let's travel around quickly and check out some other news

1273
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:15,280
going on in the industry in some rapid fire news.

1274
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:19,720
Loki. Yeah. So first off, I want to start with a cool ROM hack

1275
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,880
that I saw posted on Twitter.

1276
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:26,960
So this is actually a it's called Contravania, the Ecclesia edition.

1277
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,880
It is a ROM hack of Castlevania

1278
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,760
order of Ecclesia.

1279
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:37,120
And it's basically adds

1280
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,920
the characters from Contra,

1281
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,600
mainly actually a Contra rebirth

1282
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,880
into the game, and it plays like Contra.

1283
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,360
That is very awesome.

1284
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:51,360
So they have multiple different patches

1285
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,080
you can do to it to get different characters in there.

1286
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:58,480
So they have like Bill Riser, Genbei, Yagyu,

1287
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:02,560
Propotector, Pliskin, Brad Fang,

1288
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,520
and then for some reason, Sans from Undertales in there.

1289
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,760
I don't really know what that's all about, but it looks.

1290
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,560
I'm sorry, we said Yagyu Jubei.

1291
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,720
It's Genbei Yagyu.

1292
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:20,480
It's there from Contra Rebirth.

1293
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,200
OK, I was just thinking of the of

1294
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:28,720
I mean, because a lot of games will reuse the historical person as a character.

1295
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:32,560
And I was like, whoa, well, it's sort of kind of like so that

1296
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,840
that person is sort of kind of based off of that.

1297
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,440
They look like a samurai, but the eye patch and everything.

1298
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,240
Yes. And they have.

1299
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,880
OK, that's cool.

1300
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,240
So, yeah, that's awesome.

1301
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,640
Yeah. So they've got that.

1302
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:50,040
It's it looks cool.

1303
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,560
Like I just saw the gameplay online and it's amazing.

1304
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,480
But yeah, it's for the DS version of the game.

1305
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:58,280
So there is, I think, one emulator on PC that works with it.

1306
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:02,160
And obviously, if you have a flash cart, you can put it on your actual DS

1307
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:05,440
and then, you know, lots of other homebrew options

1308
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,800
available for playing DS games as well.

1309
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,400
So go check that out. Pretty cool.

1310
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,800
And then Super Nintendo World

1311
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:18,160
in Universal Hollywood finally has an opening date,

1312
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:22,240
and that is February 17th, 2023.

1313
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,560
We can go experience

1314
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,360
the boring Yoshi ride and then the komari car ride.

1315
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,960
That's going to sneak up on us.

1316
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,680
February 17th is, if you think about it, like two months away.

1317
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,080
So, yeah, not that long.

1318
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,120
Yeah, I'm excited. I want to go check it out.

1319
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:39,880
I don't think I'll go the first day for sure.

1320
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:43,480
But no, if I can, if I can figure out when spring break is

1321
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:47,040
and like not go that week either, like on a weekday in March or April.

1322
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,720
Sounds great to just check it out.

1323
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:49,760
I think it'll be a lot of fun.

1324
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,640
Yeah, I want to go again.

1325
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,960
All right, Darcy.

1326
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:02,080
So Amazon has announced that they are developing a God of War series.

1327
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,600
They were in talks with Sony to adapt it.

1328
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:08,680
They reported this back in March,

1329
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:14,760
and they were reporting that the creators and producers of The Expanse,

1330
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:20,040
along with the executive producer of Wheel of Time,

1331
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:25,760
would be leading the project with input from Sony.

1332
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,800
And Amazon said, yep, we're doing that.

1333
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:32,880
So we'll see how it turns out.

1334
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,960
We're going to hear a lot of boy.

1335
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,440
Yeah. Speaking of things that are around the corner,

1336
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,160
that Last of Us series is just a couple of weeks away.

1337
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,480
So it's oh, wow. Yeah, it's like a quick.

1338
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,280
Yeah, right. Mid-January, right?

1339
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,520
It's going to be here before we know it.

1340
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:49,720
So wild. But yeah, God of War, that should be fun, too.

1341
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,920
All right. Moving on.

1342
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,680
I got really excited at the Game Awards when I heard that Sony's

1343
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:58,200
Returnal is going to be coming out for PC.

1344
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:01,600
And I guess I'm thankful I have a new rig because I have enough RAM

1345
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,440
to make this work.

1346
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:07,240
But boy, oh boy, they are recommending 32 gigs of RAM.

1347
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:12,040
You can run Returnal with 16 gigs, but they are recommending

1348
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:15,520
this is per Returnal Steam listing 32 gigs to get the most out of,

1349
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,400
you know, the graphics and the gameplay.

1350
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:20,040
For the record, Microsoft's Flight Simulator,

1351
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:24,080
which if you've ever played that game, especially in 4K, is gorgeous.

1352
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:28,440
That game requires eight and recommends 16.

1353
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,840
So Returnal needs more RAM than Flight Simulator.

1354
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,200
Honestly, I'm kind of not surprised considering, you know,

1355
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,200
what a fast moving game Returnal is.

1356
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,640
Flight Simulator is more of a fly and chill.

1357
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,640
Returnal has like a lot of stuff going on on the screen.

1358
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,720
It's a very fast moving game, so not completely surprised.

1359
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,720
That's probably why it needs so much RAM.

1360
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:48,040
Sounds like it's very unoptimized, if you ask me.

1361
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,240
That could probably be, too.

1362
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:54,720
So we'll see. No, no, no, nothing known yet.

1363
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:57,960
If it will include support for Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's

1364
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:02,640
FSR's upscaling technology, but we'll see.

1365
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:06,440
Apparently, some leaked video is giving insight that it might.

1366
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,440
Also, other system requirements.

1367
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:16,400
You'll need an Intel i7-8700 or an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X CPU.

1368
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:22,040
And you need to have at least an Nvidia RTX 2070 Super or an AMD RX

1369
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:25,760
6700 XT GPU to meet the recommended specs.

1370
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,120
Money.

1371
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:30,960
Yeah, I know it's, but I mean, you know, you're talking about playing

1372
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,000
a PlayStation 5 game on your PC, so I can understand why it's so demanding.

1373
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,200
But yeah, it's not going to be cheap, that's for sure, though.

1374
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,640
I will probably pick it up, but we'll see.

1375
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:48,920
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1376
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:54,040
I don't know if it's still busy, but I guess especially with digital storefronts,

1377
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,600
who knows, but I feel like this time of year is more for sales.

1378
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,040
But let's see anyway.

1379
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,080
Loki, anything coming out in the US this week?

1380
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,040
Not a lot.

1381
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,480
There's Majestic

1382
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:08,760
Magical looks like, and that's on Nintendo Switch.

1383
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,960
Uta no Princess Sama All Star After Secret on Nintendo Switch

1384
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,200
and Valkyrie Profile Lineth on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

1385
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,400
That's it. That's it for the year.

1386
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:22,920
We're all done.

1387
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,000
All right. Well, going to Japan, obviously, the holidays flow

1388
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,320
a little different there.

1389
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:30,200
So you do have some releases still on the Nintendo Switch this week,

1390
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:33,080
including that same Uta no Prince Sama is out this week.

1391
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,440
Earth Defense Force 4.1, The Shadow of New Despair.

1392
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,400
That is coming out in Japan this week.

1393
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,520
Majestic Majolical is also out this week,

1394
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:46,360
as well as Fitness Boxing Fist of the North Star,

1395
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:47,640
which I want to see.

1396
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:49,160
Didn't we talk about that on a previous show

1397
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:51,400
because we talked about the arcade game they used to have?

1398
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:54,800
Well, that's finally out on the Switch this week, so enjoy that.

1399
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,720
Money Parasite is out this week as well.

1400
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:01,520
And a game called Witch's Garden in regular and limited edition

1401
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,840
is also out on the Switch this week.

1402
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,040
Going over to the PlayStation 5.

1403
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,800
That one's a little more empty.

1404
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,080
We might see like one lone release next week,

1405
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,600
but otherwise a little quiet on the PS5 front.

1406
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:14,840
But lots of stuff for Switch fans this week.

1407
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,520
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

1408
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,040
One thing on there and didn't even give it a date.

1409
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,400
Oh, actually, I take that back.

1410
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,960
The date was yesterday

1411
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:28,480
for Switch was WRC Generations.

1412
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:31,400
All right. Well, it's that time of year

1413
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,920
where things are slowing down to be expected.

1414
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,280
All right. We have just a few more stories for you,

1415
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,440
and then we will get to the listener roundtable.

1416
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,040
I know we have at least one email tonight,

1417
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:44,800
and we'll see if we get any comments and possibly some calls over at Discord,

1418
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,480
our VOG Network Discord server.

1419
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:49,760
Speaking of Discord, we're going to do something next week.

1420
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,960
Show is on a weird day.

1421
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,280
So we're going to do something a little bit special,

1422
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:55,720
and it's going to involve Discord.

1423
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,520
And I'm going to explain that in a little bit.

1424
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:02,200
But first, let's get into a few more stories, starting with Loki.

1425
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:06,520
Yeah, so Justin Roiland's new game High on Life.

1426
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,520
It was revealed that the bigger studio

1427
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:14,720
Squanch Games used the AI art tool mid journey AI

1428
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:19,400
to generate some assets for the game

1429
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:22,840
and add some quote unquote finishing touches.

1430
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,360
Now, basically, they were saying that they used AI art tools

1431
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:34,400
because it doesn't look like as if a person made them.

1432
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,920
It's kind of like almost alien, sort of.

1433
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:42,920
And so they said it made the world feel like a strange alternate

1434
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:45,240
universe of our world.

1435
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,520
And we used it to make or to come up with weird, funny ideas.

1436
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:53,640
So I can imagine like generating different things and it's all messed up.

1437
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:57,360
So then they take those assets to kind of

1438
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
make their own art, I guess it's almost like concept art, I guess.

1439
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:06,760
Basically saying I don't know what that's in very well with Rick and Morty.

1440
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,840
Yeah, I don't know what the future holds, but AI is going to be a tool

1441
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:14,360
that has potential to make content creation incredibly accessible.

1442
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:16,400
I don't know how many years away we are,

1443
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:21,000
but all you will need is somebody with some big ideas.

1444
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:25,000
Of course, you know, it's still controversial with using AI art

1445
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:30,160
anyways, because it is being trained off of a lot of artists

1446
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:33,280
work who didn't necessarily consent to being used.

1447
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:37,240
And one of those major sites that artists do showcase

1448
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:40,240
a lot of their work that they do is, of course,

1449
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:47,440
ArtStation, who was actually being included in some of these AI trainings

1450
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:52,680
and made a comment regarding permission and AI art generators.

1451
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:56,480
This is we believe artists should be free to decide how their art is used.

1452
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:00,000
And simultaneously, we don't want to become gatekeepers with the site

1453
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:04,640
terms that stifle AI research and commercialization

1454
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:08,640
when it respects artists choices and copyright laws.

1455
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:13,560
So their plans right now are going to be enabling

1456
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:17,520
or adding tags enabling artists to choose explicitly to allow

1457
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:22,200
or disallow the use of art for training and non-commercial AI research

1458
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,800
and to train commercial AI.

1459
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:27,080
And they plan to update ArtStation

1460
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:30,920
website's terms of service to disallow the use of art or whatever.

1461
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,560
Artists aren't happy about that

1462
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,280
because they feel they should be taking a stronger stance

1463
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:41,560
to protect their works, but they are not doing that.

1464
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:46,480
So obviously, they have been protesting by putting no AI type stuff.

1465
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:50,120
Also, like, I mean, it doesn't account for all the AI

1466
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,440
that's already been trained on that stuff, so.

1467
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:56,680
I don't know, it's it's it's a tricky subject.

1468
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:03,280
Yeah, it's tricky because, you know, obviously I don't love the idea of AI,

1469
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:06,360
you know, basically because like, you know, that app that came out recently,

1470
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,920
I remember it was called, but everybody was posting their pictures on Facebook

1471
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:12,200
and stuff, and for me, I was a little I was more like,

1472
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,840
I feel like every time one of these hot new apps comes out,

1473
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,920
you find out something about the development team you don't like.

1474
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:19,320
So I stayed away from it.

1475
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:22,000
But, you know, it looked like a lot of the pictures that are coming out of it

1476
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,280
are basically like artwork that literally was someone else's,

1477
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:29,320
but like with someone's head slapped onto it

1478
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:32,320
and the fingers all different because I can never get fingers right.

1479
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:36,000
So it's like a former president's NFT drop or something.

1480
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,360
It's really weird. I'm not going to go there.

1481
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:42,800
But, you know, so so AI is is really silly in that regard.

1482
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,800
And the fact that, you know, it's using stolen artwork isn't cool.

1483
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:51,520
However, that being said, I don't like to just brush off AI artistry

1484
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:55,040
all in one fell swoop because I kind of see where,

1485
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,560
you know, if we're talking about next gen gaming, especially when we get into

1486
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:02,840
like PlayStation six game development, I know I'm getting way ahead of myself here.

1487
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:06,440
But you know how hard it's going to be to animate for these,

1488
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:10,360
you know, 8K TVs or whatever, you know, graphical fidelities coming up next

1489
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,440
and so forth, it's going to get harder and harder.

1490
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:17,080
So I can see where maybe AI starts to get useful

1491
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:21,840
in developing like really high definition art later on.

1492
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,200
But that would all be trained off of art that the studio is doing

1493
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,560
and rules that the studio builds into their engine,

1494
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,600
which is obviously a very different sort of argument.

1495
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:34,200
But that's where I'm like, OK, that's where AI art makes sense to me,

1496
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:37,280
is literally automating processes

1497
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:40,760
that otherwise would cause a game 20 years to get made.

1498
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,280
That makes sense.

1499
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:45,800
But the whole like, you know, plugging your face or your

1500
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,680
and I see this shit for sale on Facebook all the time,

1501
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:53,200
plugging your dog into the dogs playing poker artwork and all this stuff like

1502
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:54,040
this is silly.

1503
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:57,560
And, you know, obviously dogs playing poker is one because that's classic.

1504
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:01,720
But when it's, you know, somebody's deviant art or art station or whatever,

1505
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:05,040
and it feels a little slimy to be doing that to me.

1506
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,320
They've had some really cool like applications

1507
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:10,040
even outside of the art stuff, like the chat GPT stuff,

1508
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:13,440
which where you can actually have like conversations with the chat bot

1509
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:16,520
and it'll like, you know, I said, OK, like, here's some code I wrote.

1510
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:19,760
Can you rewrite it in this language and it will do it for you or like,

1511
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:23,200
hey, I need you to generate me something that does this

1512
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,880
and it will usually do it correctly.

1513
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,840
And it's pretty incredible, like some of the stuff

1514
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,080
where they'll explain to you like how to do something in a certain way.

1515
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:33,400
And it's pretty cool.

1516
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:37,800
So like that, combined with like some of these things, it's me.

1517
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,920
It's when you kind of take it to the extremes, though, where it's

1518
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,080
it's starting to get a little bit like ridiculous.

1519
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:47,000
Like there is somebody who generated a.

1520
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:50,040
Children's book using an A.I.

1521
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,960
to write the book for him and then use another A.I.

1522
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,680
to create the pictures for it and then publish that as his own work.

1523
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:58,200
Which is kind of like.

1524
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,560
I don't know, it's a little weird.

1525
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,320
It is a little weird.

1526
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,000
Credit, it's definitely on the darker side of gray.

1527
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Yeah, credit the robot with writing the book, right?

1528
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,360
Credit credit seven and nine with writing your book.

1529
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:15,080
You know, don't credit, you know, yourself.

1530
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:17,040
It's a little silly.

1531
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,200
And then right now we've had all the A.I.

1532
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:23,960
is being trained off of like with specific rules in place.

1533
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:26,960
Like what's going to happen later on when

1534
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:31,320
we start having people train them to do other things like, you know.

1535
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:35,680
Photoshop celebrities into different pornographic situations.

1536
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:38,920
Oh, yeah. And it's just going to get nuts.

1537
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,760
Yeah, that's, you know, or or like even not even necessarily that,

1538
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:45,960
but like even like the faking, deep fakes, deeper fakes,

1539
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:48,280
deepest fakes, deep, dark fakes.

1540
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:52,600
Yeah, like faking, because you can have a I generate voices

1541
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:57,040
like it can take someone's voice and figure out how to speak like it

1542
01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:00,360
and reproduce that with whatever you want.

1543
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:02,280
So like you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.

1544
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,080
Wild, wild.

1545
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:06,080
Well, that A.I.

1546
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,760
to determine whether something's A.I. generated or not. Right.

1547
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:12,320
The test determined that was A.I.

1548
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:14,600
All right.

1549
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,880
I just need an A.I.

1550
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:18,680
to prove that I'm not a robot so that, you know,

1551
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:20,200
I don't have to fill those things out anymore.

1552
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,600
Maybe, maybe we all are secretly half Cylon.

1553
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:26,600
Who knows? Anyway,

1554
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,880
Dijarama says Adobe came out with a program for A.I.

1555
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:31,440
voices caused an uproar in the voice acting community.

1556
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,160
Oh, I bet. Tiger Cost says there's A.I.

1557
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:37,720
generated podcast that had Joe Rogan interviewing Steve Jobs.

1558
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:40,200
I can think of nothing I want to hear less.

1559
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:43,080
All right. In a sense, yes, yes, I get that.

1560
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:44,560
Like and that's horrible.

1561
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:49,600
But I'm just saying, but I do like the premise of like generating

1562
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:51,400
funny things with some of these.

1563
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:54,160
Like, for example, it's funnier when it's like the daily show

1564
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:56,680
using clips from an actual interview.

1565
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:57,680
Well, no, I like that.

1566
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:00,760
But like there is something I saw where it was like like

1567
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,600
it was that chat chat

1568
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:06,000
GBT thing where it's like, hey, I want you to explain me this

1569
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:10,160
as a script for Seinfeld or something like there's a Seinfeld episode.

1570
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:11,320
And that was funny.

1571
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:14,320
Like some of the stuff that they do with that,

1572
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:17,000
I think is pretty funny. Hmm.

1573
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,120
All right.

1574
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:21,760
Well, I don't know if a robot could create this next game,

1575
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:23,520
but Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1576
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:31,040
A very, very interesting flashback,

1577
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:33,720
I would say, you know, emphasis on the flash

1578
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:38,400
Fantavision 2020 X

1579
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:45,560
is coming out on PlayStation five with PlayStation VR to support.

1580
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:51,400
It's going to be a digital game to release on February 22nd, 2023.

1581
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:55,560
And now the original came out on PlayStation two.

1582
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:59,960
As I'm sure we might remember, it was people like, what's with this game?

1583
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:03,080
And then everyone played it and was like, oh, this game is kind of addicting.

1584
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:08,680
But you basically hit like different missiles,

1585
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,520
kind of, I guess, defender ish.

1586
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:15,120
Am I thinking of defender or missile command?

1587
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:17,560
Missile command, my brain, I can't brain.

1588
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:21,480
And then they explode and they're pretty.

1589
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:22,720
There's more to it than that.

1590
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,400
But the explode and pretty part is is really awesome.

1591
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,960
And then it'll have like vibration feedback through the controller

1592
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:34,200
and all kinds of haptic joy and and explosions.

1593
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:37,040
And then you get a star mine.

1594
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:42,040
I don't know if their trailer does it justice, but it doesn't look that great.

1595
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:45,240
Like it's like I saw the trailer graphic.

1596
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:50,000
It does look like Fantavision, but it doesn't look like a PlayStation five game.

1597
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,680
It looks like a PlayStation three game.

1598
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:55,680
And it's like and I get it like maybe for the VR part of that,

1599
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:59,080
they have a scale of all the one on PlayStation VR to be able to push

1600
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,560
better fidelity than that.

1601
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:03,640
It just doesn't look.

1602
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:08,160
It looks dated like and that's too bad because Fantavision was great title.

1603
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:14,560
I can tell you just said it just now, Jamie, that the game's coming out in February.

1604
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:18,280
I kind of forgot that PSVR two is like that close to release.

1605
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:21,120
I thought we were still a ways out from that, but wowee.

1606
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,120
Well, Shane's in chat and he's excited for this.

1607
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:27,480
He says, I'm here day one for Fantavision for my PSVR two.

1608
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:31,280
There's like 30 launch titles now for it, and it makes me more excited to get mine.

1609
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:35,240
I hope the crazy, nonsensical Fantavision cutscenes are in this one, too.

1610
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:37,960
Dr. Seuss says, I'm surprised they brought this back.

1611
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:40,800
I think this is one of the first PS two games I ever played.

1612
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,800
Yeah, a lot of love.

1613
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:43,080
A lot of people is like their first.

1614
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:45,360
Maybe it's the YouTube dance now.

1615
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:46,920
Doo doo doo doo doo.

1616
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:50,200
Of course. Maybe it's the YouTube compression that's doing it

1617
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,320
because I'm looking at the screenshots and they look better.

1618
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:55,920
But like, yeah, the YouTube video does not look great.

1619
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,960
Check your options and make sure it's not defaulting to a low resolution.

1620
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:01,840
No, it's 1080. It's just.

1621
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:06,880
Yeah, because they're they're talking about like 4K graphics and stuff like that.

1622
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:09,280
And so maybe maybe that would look better,

1623
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:12,120
but it did look kind of not great in the other one.

1624
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:16,120
SSG100 Matt says, semi-related, I kind of miss Boom Boom Rocket.

1625
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:17,280
I should try to reload it.

1626
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:18,680
Oh, that was a good one.

1627
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:21,040
I think it is backwards compatible.

1628
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:25,040
I believe if you had that on 360, it shows up in your Xbox one library,

1629
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:28,440
which would in turn show up in your Series X library.

1630
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:33,360
And all the songs in that game were like redone classical tunes.

1631
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:34,920
It's like the William Tell Overture and stuff.

1632
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,920
So they don't have to worry about licensing,

1633
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:39,520
causing the game to get delisted or any of that stuff.

1634
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,800
So if you had Boom Boom Rocket, I don't know if they still sell it.

1635
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:45,720
I don't see why they wouldn't, though.

1636
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:48,840
But yeah, Boom Boom Rocket was like kind of Fantavision meets

1637
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:51,080
an actual music game title. It was a little bit of both.

1638
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:54,080
So I remember that one. It was a lot of fun.

1639
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:58,240
I remember there was one achievement I couldn't get and I was so mad.

1640
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:00,600
I don't remember which one it was, but I almost want to go back and do it.

1641
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:01,880
So, oh, Dr.

1642
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:04,040
C is I know I saw it on the store still.

1643
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:06,480
All right. Well, it's still there. That's cool.

1644
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:10,120
All right. Loki, another Hollywood story. Yeah.

1645
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:15,440
Yep. I keep forgetting that they are actually making a Five Nights at Freddy's

1646
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:20,200
movie, Blumhouse's, and they've announced a couple more actors

1647
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:21,480
that are joining the cast.

1648
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:24,000
So Matthew Lillard from,

1649
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,880
you know, a 13 ghost scream and of course, you know, Shaggy

1650
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,440
and then Josh Hutcherson, who I recognize,

1651
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:36,480
but I don't remember which movies it in.

1652
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,600
They say tragedy girls, but I've never seen that.

1653
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:40,000
But he's been in other things, too.

1654
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:44,480
And what's cool is they say Jim Henson's

1655
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:47,040
creature shop is working on the animatronic.

1656
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:49,680
Oh, that's fun. That's going to be good.

1657
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,120
I mean, fantastic.

1658
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:53,240
So I can't wait to see this.

1659
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,200
Don't know what's coming out.

1660
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,320
They started filming back in February.

1661
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:00,840
Yeah. Walk the wait and see you get.

1662
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:04,960
Or well, maybe with the did they film in February or they got to start filming?

1663
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,800
They start and you know, I'll be gone.

1664
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:11,120
And I was going to say, you don't announce your cast eight months after.

1665
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:14,280
Yeah. OK, so yeah, they're going to start filming in February.

1666
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:18,760
So hopefully, hopefully they're in the next year or, you know, early 2024.

1667
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:24,240
Mission chat says can confirm Boom Boom Rocket is still on the Xbox store for 10 bucks.

1668
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:26,120
So there you go about that one.

1669
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:29,240
As John Hunter Matt agrees, it will be great that Jim Henson's

1670
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:31,200
creature shop is working on this.

1671
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:33,840
Tiger Claw is wondering, I wonder what the tone of the movie will be,

1672
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:36,760
a horror comedy, and will it be PG-13?

1673
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:38,640
I think it's almost certainly PG-13.

1674
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:41,680
They're not going to go are and think the games were never gory.

1675
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:45,280
It was always implied violence is jump scares and implied violence.

1676
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,640
So I really don't see why it's not.

1677
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:49,400
So it's hard to say.

1678
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:51,360
I guess that's true.

1679
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:56,680
But I feel like they kind of market some of the merch at kids.

1680
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:59,880
So I don't know why they would want to shut at least like older teens.

1681
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:01,760
I don't know why they would want to shut them out of the movie.

1682
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,280
I think that would be foolish.

1683
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:05,000
You're right. I think it probably would be like a team.

1684
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Yeah, I think they're going to aim for PG-13 and it's

1685
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:10,040
they're just going to not be gory.

1686
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:13,040
But even it's like looking at like some of their other movies

1687
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:17,080
that they had come out, like was it that one Megan with the creepy doll thing?

1688
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,560
Can't fucking wait for that.

1689
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:21,080
Just to be clear, the PG-13.

1690
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:24,080
So a lot of horror movies are PG-13.

1691
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:25,440
They're just they're not super gory.

1692
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:28,920
The Ring was PG-13 when it was, you know, the U.S. version

1693
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:31,440
when Naomi Watts was was PG-13.

1694
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:35,360
The Sixth Sense, even though maybe not the best example, I think was PG-13.

1695
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,040
Or did they say fuck too much in that movie?

1696
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:39,000
It might have been an hour, but I think it was PG-13.

1697
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,640
I mean, something like Hereditary.

1698
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,040
Yeah, of course, that's art.

1699
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:45,400
If you know that movie or God, what was the other one that director did?

1700
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:48,400
It's like one of Dark Soccer's favorite movies, not Hereditary Midsommar.

1701
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,920
If Midsommar is great.

1702
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:53,360
Yeah, but Midsommar is definitely R rated.

1703
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:58,280
But you can do horror movies and PG-13 for sure.

1704
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:02,640
And and by the way, that Megan movie, it's only out in a couple of weeks.

1705
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:04,600
Oh, I'm so excited.

1706
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:07,640
I want to see every six Avatar two.

1707
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:08,720
I'm like, eh, whatever.

1708
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:10,600
Megan, fuck yes.

1709
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:13,440
I meant to go out this week to see Violent Night,

1710
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,880
but that may be a way to see on video.

1711
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:19,600
Remember when we all went to go see the first Avatar together?

1712
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:22,760
We went on a big date together and we saw it in 3D.

1713
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:23,680
I think it was the theater.

1714
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,680
I saw it so many times. I don't remember.

1715
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:29,640
Yeah, I've heard good things about it to the sequel, honestly.

1716
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:31,600
Yeah, I've heard good things about Avatar, too.

1717
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:37,000
But I and keep in mind the original Poltergeist was PG because PG-13 didn't exist.

1718
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,920
Yep. Yep. Yeah.

1719
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:41,160
She-Hope just pointed out about Poltergeist being PG.

1720
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:43,320
Yeah, but it would have been PG-13 if that had existed.

1721
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:45,040
That's for sure. So, yeah.

1722
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,680
So. All right.

1723
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:53,240
Moving on, let's go to our last story tonight, which very random,

1724
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:55,840
but sometimes random things turn up in the gaming world.

1725
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:58,800
And it's a lost Michael Jackson clip.

1726
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:02,720
And it has to do with Michael Jackson and the Sega world.

1727
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:06,960
You remember how Michael Jackson very clearly worked with Sega,

1728
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:09,720
like was kind of shadow working on some projects, right?

1729
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:17,960
Well, apparently, some fans have actually uncovered an extra kind of like bonus role of Michael Jackson.

1730
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:25,560
He was the lead actor in the Advanced System One or AS1 motion simulator game Scramble Training.

1731
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:30,320
Apparently, they found the tape at a flea market in the UK.

1732
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:37,080
And if you wanted to watch this on YouTube, there was just a shit camcorder 90s shaky thing that was out there.

1733
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:43,280
But thanks to finding basically either the master or a direct copy of it at a random flea market in the UK,

1734
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,800
you can see a direct transfer of the footage.

1735
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:51,280
And let's be honest, Michael Jackson, not really known for his acting.

1736
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:55,280
Video games at that time, really not known for their acting.

1737
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:59,560
You put the two together and you get not so great acting.

1738
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:05,440
But it's a piece of video game history that's like, whoa, kind of neat to be seeing this now.

1739
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:06,880
Yeah, what's that?

1740
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:07,920
Thank you.

1741
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:08,720
Thank you.

1742
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:18,800
Anyway, and yeah, apparently the guy who had the stuff he was selling at the flea market, he had some Sega merchandise

1743
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:23,120
he got from a gentleman whose father a former Sega employee had recently passed away.

1744
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:31,120
The the lucky buyer found promo posters, toys, and then apparently a D2 tape he forgot to mention he'd paid a fair bit for.

1745
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:32,440
So how about that?

1746
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,960
Anyway, so that's all over the internet.

1747
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,840
Now it's available on YouTube.

1748
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:41,040
Just look up Michael Jackson and scramble training game does all good if you care.

1749
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:42,720
No, it sure doesn't.

1750
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:44,520
But, you know, not great.

1751
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:46,560
Yeah, but it's one of those things.

1752
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:49,640
Again, you know, it's it's very dated technology.

1753
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:50,680
It's late 90s.

1754
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:57,440
So anyway, but it also loses something, too, because I think it's like one of those motion roller coaster ride things.

1755
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:58,760
Yes, yes.

1756
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:01,040
So I'm very little bit a little bit.

1757
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:02,040
All right.

1758
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:14,120
And that brings us to the listener roundtable where every week we invite your questions via our mailbag participate at orange lounge radio.com, as well as our discord server over at vog network.com.

1759
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:16,280
That's VOG network.com slash discord.

1760
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:20,760
And you can also ask questions in chat if you'd like.

1761
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:23,160
I believe we have one email tonight, though.

1762
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:25,080
So I'm going to turn it over to dark Sakura.

1763
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,400
It's a pretty short one.

1764
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:31,240
Hi, this is I can't see from Twitch and Discord.

1765
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:42,520
As a staunch supporter of cloud gaming, including Stadia, I've noticed that there's this old guard mentality in gaming mentality includes only buying disk based consoles and physical media.

1766
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:49,160
They worry about the, quote, all digital future, end quote, and prefer to, quote, own their own games.

1767
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:57,880
Because of this, some aspects of modern and future gaming habits are outside of their norm, so they turn up their noses at them.

1768
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:03,160
Things like mobile, live service, FTP, and of course, cloud gaming.

1769
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:06,800
I won't bring up the two biggest taboo elephants in the room.

1770
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:10,400
There's still a demand for ownership and the older ways.

1771
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:14,800
How do you think the industry could cater to the old guard while looking to the future?

1772
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:27,840
I'm kind of thinking like the limited rent game stuff does, you know, you know, where it becomes like a big collector's item and you get more reward for owning the game.

1773
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:30,120
It's a physical copy because it has stuff.

1774
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:44,520
Well, first off, thank you for the email I can't see, which I believe as a Stadia fan, I might be jumping to conclusions, but I'm assuming found our show through that YouTube show you did all about Stadia, Dark Sakura, right before they

1775
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:47,560
betrayed me and broke my heart.

1776
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:50,000
Right before Stadia pulled the plug on everything.

1777
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,120
So welcome.

1778
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:51,760
How dare.

1779
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:53,800
Glad we grew our family from that appearance.

1780
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:57,000
By the way, all of us available for appearances on other shows.

1781
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,960
I just did Pokemon Go podcast this week.

1782
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:01,080
It's not on their feed yet, or at least it wasn't earlier today.

1783
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:04,200
So I haven't linked it anywhere, but I had a good time with them this week.

1784
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:04,960
But I digress.

1785
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:05,680
Let me get to the email.

1786
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:12,360
So I have definitely been of that mindset for a long time that physical copies are more desirable.

1787
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:31,760
And the reason why is because I think the used game market and the second hand game market has set up the expectation that you can have some equity in your games, basically some value in your games, especially we've seen how for some older games and some classic games that can really grow.

1788
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:43,440
For example, try to get a copy of Suikoden 2 for the PlayStation, at least before they, you know, especially before they or Suikoden 1 or 2 before they did the PS3 download everything even now those games go for a lot.

1789
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:48,480
I'm sure Dark Sakura can tell you about some, you know, physical games that go for a lot of money.

1790
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:51,320
Just look up Ninja Gaiden trilogy.

1791
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:51,720
Yeah.

1792
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:54,880
Look up Mighty Final Fight, Final Fight Guy.

1793
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:56,960
I own all three of these.

1794
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:14,440
Now, while these are old school examples, I think a lot of people kind of hope that maybe if they hang on to their physical libraries, they're going to grow in value at some point, or even if I don't care for the game, I can still turn it around and get $10 back, right?

1795
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:20,880
So I think, for me, that's been why I've been tied to physical media for a long time and having that equity.

1796
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:29,600
Now, if the value is there to kind of get some of that back in a digital title, then I'm all about digital.

1797
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:37,480
And what I mean by that is, look, if you're going to discount the game for 50%, but I get it digitally, I can at least go, okay, well, I only paid half as much for this.

1798
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:40,200
So okay, if I can't turn around and sell this back.

1799
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:46,480
You asked in the email, how do you think the digital market could maybe gain something with a physical market?

1800
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:55,680
I remember a date and time when I think Steam was going to do this, Microsoft was going to do this, but then they got shot down.

1801
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:57,240
But that was a different sort of circumstances.

1802
02:02:57,240 --> 02:03:04,360
But that is put equity in your digital games, make it so that you can turn around and sell your digital games.

1803
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:10,720
You might remember this was in Microsoft's original vision for the Xbox One, but it was a little ahead of its time.

1804
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:15,040
And I don't think they were clear in the way they communicated a lot of that.

1805
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:20,520
And a lot of that got shot down and they were forced to really, you know, do a 180 on that.

1806
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:23,640
I just think Don Mattrick was a shitty messenger at the time.

1807
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:38,840
And I think could have could have probably done something a lot different with some better messaging of the Xbox One's original vision with that by allowing a system where your digital games, your digital library has equity would have been huge.

1808
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:44,200
So I think that would have that would have been a great thing, but it didn't work out that way.

1809
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:46,720
Unfortunately, Xbox is in a fine place.

1810
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:48,440
Now we got Game Pass and all this other stuff.

1811
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:59,480
But, you know, but then I understand your nerves when it comes to things like Game Pass, you know, where movies go, the game industry is going to follow.

1812
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:02,400
And so that's why you've got things like Game Pass.

1813
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,480
And now Sony is following those footsteps.

1814
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:12,360
And I kind of I feel like Stadia if they'd offered something along that line, and I guess they did.

1815
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:16,640
But again, it wasn't communicated the best way outside of its fan base.

1816
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:20,800
You know, if you had the Stadia Pro, you got free games every month, essentially.

1817
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:25,960
But it didn't quite have that same feeling of like a library that you tapped into and all this stuff.

1818
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:28,880
At least those on the outside weren't seeing it very well.

1819
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:37,960
And I think we all know Google, Google kind of stopped supporting that not long after they released it, unfortunately, as far as the marketing standpoint goes, but

1820
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:39,640
They announced the closure of Stadia.

1821
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:41,880
They said, Oh, we're doing our cloud gaming Chromebook.

1822
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:43,880
And everyone was like, Yeah, fuck off.

1823
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,240
Yeah, right. Yeah.

1824
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:49,560
So, um, but so so where does the industry go from here?

1825
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:58,560
If a lot of things are going digital, this is exactly why exactly why Diablo four has a $100 collector's edition that doesn't have a copy of the game with it.

1826
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:11,800
And as dark soccer pointed out limited run, you know, even with the Netflix, the Hulu's, the Disney pluses, etc, of the world, there is still broadcast television.

1827
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:22,120
There is still blu rays, you know, there's still going to be a demand for some of the old guard because broadcast television excels at live TV.

1828
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:27,640
I mean, look at what happened when they tried to put Dancing with the Stars on Disney Plus, I think it's lost like half of its viewers.

1829
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:29,640
And you can't fault Tyra Banks for all of that.

1830
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:35,160
So I think live TV really excels on the traditional broadcast networks, especially news.

1831
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:38,560
You can't do news today anyway.

1832
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:44,360
Well, they tried look what happened to CNN plus that came in when as fast as it could, right.

1833
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:55,520
So anyway, but I do think cloud gaming is also going to be in the future, you know, more and more and I'm not talking like exclusive cloud stuff.

1834
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:59,600
I'm talking about games that are in part powered by the cloud.

1835
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:03,720
You've heard about, you know, one of Kojima's games, I don't know if it's Death Stranding 2.

1836
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:13,080
No, it's not because it's something that's going to be Xbox exclusive, I think, because he was talking about partnering with Microsoft and their cloud is going to be something that probably leverages the cloud.

1837
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:24,160
So I sort of think a lot of gaming is going digital, whether you like it or not, I don't think the cloud catches on completely until over the air 5g is accessible in more places.

1838
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:29,520
But I think 10 years from now, yeah, you're going to be looking at cloud gaming being a big part of things.

1839
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:42,800
How do people get value, either physical trinkets, collector's edition, or somebody figuring out how to develop that system where you can buy and sell digital games, I think is going to be huge for that.

1840
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,520
So, but the industry is evolving.

1841
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:46,400
Hang on.

1842
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:47,240
And to agree.

1843
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:48,000
Yeah.

1844
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:54,480
But there's always I mean, you know, not not to be to be a dead horse, but look at the merchandising.

1845
02:06:54,600 --> 02:07:11,320
Yeah, it's like the space balls, merchandising, merchandising, okay, because if you go to Target, I remember when I was a kid, you didn't see an aisle full of video game tie ins, video game merchandising when I was a kid.

1846
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:17,400
But now you go and there's an aisle that's Fortnite, Minecraft, Five Nights.

1847
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:22,000
I mean, a lot of these large games get a lot of merchandising.

1848
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:24,360
Heck, the Mario Legos.

1849
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:25,440
You know what that is?

1850
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:26,880
Merchandising.

1851
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:27,720
Merchandising.

1852
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:32,480
Super Mario World at Hollywood, Universal Hollywood.

1853
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:33,400
You know what that is?

1854
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:36,520
An opportunity to sell toilet paper.

1855
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:38,640
Super merchandising.

1856
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:42,040
So I think you're just going to see a lot of that.

1857
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:47,280
But that also just has to do with the fact that the kids are grown up now.

1858
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:48,400
Yeah.

1859
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:50,960
The kids are grown up now and have kids.

1860
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:53,680
Video games is a part of our culture.

1861
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:57,360
It's not a fringe thing that nerds do in their basement.

1862
02:07:58,240 --> 02:08:03,480
There's just as many women as men, if not more, that play video games now.

1863
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:06,960
So it's it's a part of our culture.

1864
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:09,720
And so the merchandising makes more sense.

1865
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:11,520
Because people, yeah.

1866
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:13,200
Sorry, Mike Deft.

1867
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:14,520
Yes, I got the name wrong in the moment.

1868
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:15,920
It's Super Nintendo World.

1869
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:17,560
Excuse my beauty.

1870
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:18,600
All right.

1871
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:20,600
Thank you for the email.

1872
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:22,080
I can't see that was a great topic.

1873
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:22,720
Appreciate it.

1874
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:24,120
All right.

1875
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:28,960
If you want to send us an email with a great topic or an average one, that's okay, too.

1876
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:32,840
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

1877
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:35,720
Also, I saw some comments in chat.

1878
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:37,400
So I saw a question in chat here.

1879
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:39,640
And if I missed your question, please go ahead and restate it.

1880
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:42,960
But She-Hulk10 asked you a question of our panel tonight.

1881
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:45,000
What do you guys want for Christmas?

1882
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:48,600
Well, Dark Soccer celebrates Hanukkah, but we'll say-

1883
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:49,800
I take presents.

1884
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:52,240
Yeah, you'll accept Christmas gifts.

1885
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:52,680
Sure.

1886
02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:54,880
Well, I've made it abundantly clear what I want.

1887
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:58,520
Steam wallet so I can get Midnight Suns.

1888
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:04,240
So what you really want is the hundred dollar Midnight Suns collector's edition.

1889
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:08,000
That, well, I mean, because it's the season pass and everything.

1890
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,280
I mean, that would be nice.

1891
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:11,440
But I mean, I'm being realistic.

1892
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:11,760
Yeah.

1893
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,080
Oh, who am I kidding?

1894
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:16,880
I'll just use it for RX cells for cosmetics.

1895
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:19,120
Dead by daylight.

1896
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:26,960
Which is the whole reason I'm bothering with the whole holiday rift right now.

1897
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:30,840
Well, I got what I wanted for Christmas.

1898
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:33,320
I guess I'll go ahead and tell you all what happened.

1899
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:37,400
So Alan and I exchanged gifts a little early this year

1900
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:40,000
because he wasn't going to have a way to hide my gift.

1901
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,920
And it showed up.

1902
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:43,560
It was on it was on sale.

1903
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:44,800
He had to get it.

1904
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:47,520
I just haven't built my Tron arcade machine yet,

1905
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:49,760
but it's sitting downstairs waiting to be made.

1906
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:50,560
Yep.

1907
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:52,000
So it's good.

1908
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,360
I'm going to have a twin over here,

1909
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:55,760
and that's part of the reason why I need to spin my office around.

1910
02:09:56,280 --> 02:10:00,360
I really wanted to do it this weekend, but I just I I've been a little sore

1911
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:04,640
and haven't been able to muster the energy to get all the parts and build them.

1912
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:05,920
But that'll be something

1913
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:08,360
I really hope I can do with the holiday break that's coming up.

1914
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:12,360
So I got what I wanted for Christmas, so I can't complain at all.

1915
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:15,920
Otherwise, I guess I would like to get a PlayStation five.

1916
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:16,880
But that can wait.

1917
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:19,360
That's that's a tall order, and it can wait till early next year.

1918
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:21,080
Alan and I are going on a cruise.

1919
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:23,400
We're going on the Star Trek cruise again in late February.

1920
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:27,720
So I may actually miss two O.L.R.s.

1921
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:29,800
No, I don't think I do.

1922
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:33,280
No, the the the cruise is Friday to Friday, so I'll be back on a Saturday.

1923
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:35,400
So I was like, am I going to miss O.L.R. twice?

1924
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:36,920
No, I should only miss it once, actually.

1925
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:42,040
So that's coming up and got to save money for that, too.

1926
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:45,520
I mean, the cruise is paid for, but, you know, we want spending money.

1927
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:47,840
So as you know, Matt says,

1928
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:50,280
who are the guests that are slated to be on the cruise this year?

1929
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:53,000
Janeway is back.

1930
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,080
Kate Mulgrew is back this year. That's the big name.

1931
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:58,000
I know we get a photo op with a lot of the deep space.

1932
02:10:59,000 --> 02:10:59,680
They get a lot of that.

1933
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:01,600
They have a lot of the deep space nine cast.

1934
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:03,640
Both Dax's are there this year.

1935
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:09,440
But you ask a good question, not Avery Brooks, Brooks, though,

1936
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:11,440
because he doesn't show up to that stuff. What?

1937
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:14,960
I need Nicole DeBoer's

1938
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:18,880
autograph simply and have it said to the one fan of HyperCube

1939
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:21,360
two of HyperCube.

1940
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:22,440
She wasn't in HyperCube.

1941
02:11:22,440 --> 02:11:23,960
She's had the first QQ.

1942
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:25,560
I was just say, I love you.

1943
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:27,640
But even if it's a little gory, I love the cube.

1944
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:29,320
So I thought HyperCube.

1945
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:33,000
No, I that's like what I first knew her from.

1946
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:37,440
Yeah, same. So I think we do have a photo with the two Dax's

1947
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,440
because I think it's the one that we get included

1948
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,320
for preordering the cruise or whatever.

1949
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:43,880
So but the only ones we bought

1950
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:46,920
the other big name that's going on the cruise this year

1951
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:49,320
and we bought the meet and greet with Doug Jones.

1952
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:52,400
We had to. We had to. So.

1953
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:57,040
Well, another thing, too, is that I first knew

1954
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:00,120
Terry Farrell from Hellraiser three.

1955
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:02,840
Oh, that's a good one.

1956
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:05,640
I mean, the movie wasn't great, but that's what I knew her from.

1957
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:10,760
So Doug Jones is the other big name.

1958
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:15,880
But we also got a meet and greet with Brent Spiner because we didn't.

1959
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:19,520
He was on the last cruise, but we didn't get a picture with him or whatever.

1960
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:20,880
For whatever reason, last time,

1961
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:23,840
I feel like we ought to buy a meet and greet with Denise Crosby,

1962
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:26,640
just because the more I see her, the more I love her.

1963
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:28,720
I just like she was such a highlight of the last cruise.

1964
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:31,360
So anyway, all those folks are going on the cruise this year.

1965
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,200
And let's see.

1966
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:35,880
Jonathan Frakes is the other like big name because he wasn't on the year we went.

1967
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:40,520
Let's see who else is on this year.

1968
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:42,240
There's a lot of people.

1969
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:44,920
You can go to Star Trek, the cruise dot com if you want to see the full list.

1970
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:46,960
Robert Duncan McNeil is making it this year.

1971
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:49,400
He didn't make the other Voyager year we went.

1972
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:52,720
Michelle Heard from the Picard series, just Bush from Picard

1973
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:54,600
are both going this year as well.

1974
02:12:54,600 --> 02:12:56,520
So, yeah, it's a good it's a good list.

1975
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:59,920
But I'm just honestly like celebs are one thing.

1976
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:01,200
I love the people.

1977
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:02,760
Part of the reason I love the starter crews.

1978
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:04,640
I'm a dirty casual when it comes to track.

1979
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:06,240
OK, I haven't seen every series.

1980
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:08,040
I try, but I just haven't.

1981
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:09,440
I'm not up to date on everything.

1982
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:11,560
Here's the thing. It's a great crowd.

1983
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:14,640
It's 30, 40 and 50 something nerds.

1984
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:17,400
Shatner is not there this year, thank God.

1985
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:20,200
So I expect most of the crowd will be a little more progressive.

1986
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:21,600
Here's and here's the thing.

1987
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:24,680
Not that I care about a person's political leanings totally,

1988
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:26,120
but here's the thing.

1989
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:29,240
If Alan and I hold hands on the boat, nobody gives a shit.

1990
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:32,600
Unfortunately, the reality is most cruises, that's not the case.

1991
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:38,240
You get a you get a boomer population that still kind of lives in old times

1992
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:40,680
and has some old ways of thinking.

1993
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:44,640
So that's part of the reason I like going on the Star Trek cruise, quite frankly.

1994
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:47,240
And I don't I don't want to go on a gay cruise because

1995
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:52,080
gay cruises oftentimes are one of two things.

1996
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:56,320
They're floating circuit parties, which I'm not interested in,

1997
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:00,720
or they're all lesbians with kids, which is great for that audience.

1998
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:03,080
Not what I'm looking for in a cruise.

1999
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:05,760
I'm looking for the nerd cruise. Perfect for me.

2000
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:10,680
So anyway, Loki, we did not get your what do you want for Christmas?

2001
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:12,520
Going back to She-Hulk's question.

2002
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:15,920
Oh, I don't know. A few hundred subscribers on YouTube.

2003
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:18,800
Oh, yeah, I'd like that on Twitch, please.

2004
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:21,520
It's a fair ask. We want that for VOG Network, too.

2005
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:25,240
Hint hint. So, of course, everyone here, I assume, is already following.

2006
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:28,160
If you're not, though, consider it. Thank you.

2007
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:30,760
All right. Great questions.

2008
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:33,720
Let's see, looking in chat for some other questions.

2009
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:36,040
I don't see any, but I do want to mention this.

2010
02:14:36,040 --> 02:14:39,520
So we are going to be doing a show next week, probably a shorter show,

2011
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:42,000
but we're going to be here. Next week is Christmas Day.

2012
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,960
We don't expect you all are going to be here.

2013
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:45,800
However, Bobby Black Wolf will be back.

2014
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:47,880
He will be on that night and will be here as well.

2015
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:51,920
We're going to open up the floor to further questions.

2016
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:54,640
I know we don't always get a lot at the end of the show.

2017
02:14:54,640 --> 02:14:58,520
However, we're going to format the show for December 25th

2018
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:01,240
a little bit like we did the 20th anniversary show.

2019
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:03,840
We're going to format it a little bit more like a panel

2020
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,720
where we're going to answer your questions.

2021
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:07,800
And your questions can be about gaming.

2022
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:09,760
They can be about podcasting.

2023
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:14,960
They can be about life lessons, whatever you want to ask about within reason.

2024
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:17,680
DJ Rama S says the return of Ask Orange Lounge?

2025
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:21,680
Pretty much. So whatever you want to ask, within reason.

2026
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:22,960
This is not Dr. Ruth.

2027
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:25,640
OK, but as long as I mean, at the same time,

2028
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:27,160
we could try to fake her accent.

2029
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:32,320
I would I would blur the line of being offensive if I tried to do that.

2030
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:34,640
So I don't know, but I love Dr. Ruth too.

2031
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:38,720
But anyway, I will create a thread and discord after the show.

2032
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:39,360
If you would like to.

2033
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:42,000
I was trying to do it during the show, and then I realized, oops,

2034
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:45,760
Loki and Dark Sakura's faces go away when I switch screens on discord.

2035
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:49,440
I will make a thread on in the Orange Lounge radio channel on discord

2036
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:52,280
after the show for you to submit your questions for consideration.

2037
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:54,600
We probably won't get to everything, but we'll try.

2038
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:56,880
So we look forward to seeing you next week.

2039
02:15:58,040 --> 02:16:01,520
With that, let me check with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

2040
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:04,200
Oh, I thought so.

2041
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:05,320
It's probably a little bit.

2042
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:08,520
The next two weeks going to be a little slower, and that's OK.

2043
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:11,080
I should say this is going to be the format of the show

2044
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:14,840
for the next two weeks, because I anticipate between Christmas and New Year's.

2045
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:18,760
It's going to be a lot of the best games of 2022.

2046
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:20,040
And we can talk about that as well.

2047
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:23,640
But it's not going to be a lot of new news coming out that week.

2048
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:25,400
Maybe it may be a little bit.

2049
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:29,360
But we can always do like we know the news is good.

2050
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,280
We always used to do like our top games.

2051
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:35,080
And then we also did like predictions as well.

2052
02:16:35,240 --> 02:16:36,840
Oh, we need to bring that back.

2053
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:38,280
I agree. Let's do predictions.

2054
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:41,320
We'll do that on January 1st. That'd be fun.

2055
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:43,960
As you know, Matt says, we do have our predictions of 2022 to get to.

2056
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:46,160
No, we don't. We never did them

2057
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:48,320
because of the whole virtual situation.

2058
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:52,000
And always we're doing something else, which is nothing. Yeah.

2059
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:53,440
So we'll we'll mix it up.

2060
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:55,640
We don't have a robot sitting on the desk anymore

2061
02:16:56,200 --> 02:17:00,400
because who could have predicted covid, but we'll we'll do this.

2062
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:07,320
All right. Anyhow, on that note, let's wrap it up for tonight.

2063
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:10,200
We'll go around and get folks final thoughts and then we'll be done for tonight.

2064
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:14,240
Dara Sakura, I'm assuming you are doing a post show tonight

2065
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:16,120
with some Debbie Delight.

2066
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:19,840
I am. Gwen is as Gwen and I are already partied up

2067
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:22,200
and we have room for two more to join us.

2068
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:24,880
If I didn't have to edit,

2069
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:27,600
I didn't have to edit or get all that done, plus I smell dinner.

2070
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:30,720
So there'll be time later than that.

2071
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:32,760
We'll see. We'll see. All right.

2072
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:35,960
And we're going to just go around

2073
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:38,000
and jump in snowmen and be ridiculous.

2074
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:39,480
Sounds like fun.

2075
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:42,240
Do you have a final look on my Twitter for my Megamis pictures?

2076
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:44,560
Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

2077
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:47,680
I was my final thought. Oh, OK.

2078
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:52,080
Come come play with us and and and and and and give me a dollar.

2079
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:55,720
All right. Bye, Dara.

2080
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:58,640
Hi, look, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2081
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:03,800
My final thought is I must still be working on content creation some more.

2082
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,240
It sounds good.

2083
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:07,720
It's going to be all life.

2084
02:18:07,720 --> 02:18:11,160
Yeah, I I definitely want to leverage more tick tock.

2085
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:14,320
It's just about finding that right thing to talk about

2086
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:15,600
that I'm very passionate about.

2087
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:18,440
So and just, you know, sitting down and doing it right.

2088
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:21,560
It's it's it's it's harder than you think it really is.

2089
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:26,240
Yeah. Otherwise, my final thought, I don't I don't know.

2090
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:28,880
Just I hope everybody out there has a good holiday.

2091
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:33,200
If you are the Hanukkah celebrating sword, I hope you have a good holiday.

2092
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:35,120
It's starting off well for you.

2093
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:37,080
If you're the solstice sword, I hope you have a good way.

2094
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:40,000
You know, even if Christmas sort out, just have a great holiday.

2095
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Thank you for being here.

2096
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Thank you for making us a part of your weekly routine.

2097
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:48,600
I'm just very grateful that we're still here going into our 21st year next year.

2098
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:53,680
If you can believe it from 2002 to 2023, it'll be our 21st year next year.

2099
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:55,000
Old enough to drink.

2100
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,840
I kind of can't believe it, but it is what it is.

2101
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:59,880
So thank you so much for being a part of it.

2102
02:18:59,880 --> 02:19:01,600
That's it. That's all I have to say.

2103
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:03,160
Have a wonderful week, everybody.

2104
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:05,280
Happy holiday. Happy December.

2105
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:07,560
Take care. We'll see you next time. Good night, everyone.
