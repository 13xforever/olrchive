0	14360	I'm pretty sure I remember video games being 50 US dollars, yet seeing a $49.99 price tag
14360	18660	in stores seems unfamiliar. I'm of course very acquainted with the $60 price point.
18660	22340	This week, Microsoft stated it's planned to join the $70 club for all of its first-party
22340	26180	titles too, and now two-thirds of console manufacturers and game publishers have made
26180	28340	the Switch. That just leaves the Switch.
28340	31620	This is the intro that references inflation. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts,
31620	34900	Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34900	37700	Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
37700	45660	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
45660	52660	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back at live once again with
52660	61060	episode number 940 of our show tonight, December the 11th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and
61060	66740	I'm here every week with my co-hosts. First off, say hi to Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.
66740	72420	Oh, hello. Hello. I like, you can, you're spotting, I don't think this is a new wig,
72420	74180	but you're spotting a nice looking wig tonight.
74180	79380	It's, it's, I was going to wear the, the, the red lace front, you know, the one I really
79380	82820	like, but I don't know. I just felt like black hair went with green makeup.
82820	87460	It works. It works. I do. I see it on the ice. Well, I know we're talking a lot of visuals,
87460	91700	so sorry to the podcast crowd. We do love you all that subscribe to us as Spotify,
91700	96340	iTunes. Well, don't forget, you know, folks sometimes make clips of the show,
96340	102900	but you can also always access the video archive over at twitch.tv slash vog network because
102900	107060	we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific,
107060	112260	usually right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash
112260	116900	vog network, VOG network. I say usually after Bobby Black Wolf, because he is not,
117540	122500	he wasn't on tonight. He's taking some Bobby time this week, actually some Bobby and Mrs. Bobby time
122500	129860	this week. So they, they are doing some other stuff tonight. So he will be back on December
129860	135220	the 25th. Even though it is a pretty well known holiday, he still plans to be back that night
135220	140420	because I believe as he put it, he does all of his celebrations on the Eve, which may actually
140420	143300	end up being the same thing I do this year. I don't know. We'll see. I'm still trying to
143300	149140	figure that out. So hopefully I'll know for next week because believe it or not, we're two weeks
149140	155780	away from December the 25th. So, and then we're three weeks away from new year's. So it's-
155780	157940	One week away from Hanukkah and that's important.
157940	163060	That is, it's, it's, it's, it's a little more, kind of at the end of December this year,
163060	165540	as opposed to, I think last year it was practically in November, wasn't it?
166260	171700	Yeah. And actually I got something stuck in my head and like got all my stuff out a week early
171700	177300	and then like, oh. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
178340	178900	Hello.
178900	183940	Hi. And that is not a wig. That is all his natural hair, folks. Just so you know. Loki,
184660	188500	I heard Dark Soccer, I think, recognized the game playing behind you tonight. But what is,
188500	190500	what is the game behind you playing tonight? Why?
191300	197140	It is a stall. It is a game from the Saturn. It's one of the first games I played on the Saturn.
197140	202260	And it just, it's like, I remember back then it was like, oh man, it's like an anime. It's
202260	207700	like so amazing. Um, yeah. I mean, it had really cool cut scenes and everything. And it was a
207700	212820	really nice, uh, like 2d platformer. And it flowed. Excellent music. Excellent music.
213540	216660	I just remember being enamored with the backgrounds.
217620	219620	It's all the colors.
219620	224260	It's another one of those games where it's like, we didn't think video game graphics could get any
224260	229380	prettier. And then here we are. I remember the first time I played Mario Brothers 2, actually,
229380	233140	Super Mario Brothers 2, which we all know was a remake of a Japanese game. But you know, I didn't
233140	238420	know that when I was what, 10 years old and that game came out. So, um, when I saw that game for
238420	242660	the very first time, I was like, oh my gosh, it's like a cartoon. I'm playing a cartoon on my TV.
243220	247780	These graphics are so good. Cause remember, you know, my first system was an Atari 2600,
247780	254020	you know, and like many systems of that same era, albeit, you know, Coleco or whatever the graphics
254020	257780	were pretty blocky. I mean, it was cool as hell at the time, because again, it was like, oh,
257780	263060	I'm playing these on my TV at home and not in an arcade. But, uh, like Mario Brothers 2 was the
263060	269380	first time I remember thinking I'm playing a cartoon like legit. So. I mean, to be fair,
269380	274980	like back then the resolution of everything wasn't very big anyways. And, you know, coming
274980	279540	from like playing stuff on like the Atari 2600 or something like that, it's like, yeah, it's a
279540	287860	massive jump in fidelity. So. Well, in a standard TV didn't show much more than 6, 64480. In fact,
287860	292180	I think it was less than that, to be honest. So, uh, I was like 240 and I was like 240. So,
292740	298020	uh, the fact, you know, that it was that perfect revolution for a TV, you know, the NES was just,
298660	303460	yeah, made, made for some incredible graphics. And then when we got to Super Nintendo, oh boy,
303460	309700	like then we really got some cartoon graphics on that one. Yeah. Going to the chat over at
309700	315300	twitch.tv slash vog network. Orange right says that ending in Super Mario Brothers 2 as well.
315300	319380	Oh yeah. You remember that ending in Mario Brothers 2 when you see, you know, Mario sleeping
319380	324820	and like that look when you consider that that's all like sprite based work basically put together
324820	328820	to kind of make that it's really, it was really incredible what they, what they did with that
328820	333940	whole, uh, ending sequence in that game. That looked really, really cool that I loved when
333940	339300	video games had such a rewarding ending like that. Right? Like didn't the Mario Brothers 2 ending
339300	343620	feel really good for that era? Like it was much better than the screen that said,
344260	349380	congratulations. The story is happy and press start to continue. Like it was much,
349380	354100	much more satisfying than something like that. Right. Even though when you beat a hard as hell
354100	360820	game like ghosts and goblins, you'll, you'll take whatever the game gives you. Um, yeah,
360820	365860	as 200 Matt points out, Super Mario Brothers 2 was a dream and Super Mario Brothers 3 was a stage
365860	371620	play. So what would Super Mario Brothers 4 be? The matrix? Because we never really did have a
371620	378180	Mario Brothers 4, although I guess Mario world actually numbered Super Mario 4 at its original
378180	382820	conception. I was going to say Mario world is technically, uh, labeled that, but I guess,
382820	388020	I guess, uh, they didn't actually consider it. It wasn't like part of a show like the others,
388020	393540	I guess. So, uh, anyway, looking for some other comments in chat. Hello. Hello. Uh,
393540	397540	hope everybody's doing well. Uh, dark to see us as I was just about to bring up ghosts and
397540	403300	goblins. So yeah, it's a, it's a memorable ending if nothing else anyway. When it actually ended.
404500	409060	All right, let's move on. We have some gaming news to get into tonight. And of course the big
409060	415140	thing everybody's talking about this week was the game awards because you know, I gotta,
415140	421540	I gotta hand it to Jeff. He did manage to create E3 level kind of announcements in December. Like
422260	426340	there's been good years. There's been not so good years of the game awards. I would say when it
426340	431940	comes to the, the magnitude of the announcements he had planned and the ceremony itself for the
431940	436980	most part, um, I would say it was absolutely one of the better years for the game awards.
436980	442660	Um, definitely some places to improve. I think for me, the running time was really,
442660	446820	remember when he said it wasn't going to be as long as last year and to be fair, it wasn't,
448100	454180	but didn't the steam deck things say they were only going to give away like 150 steam decks
454180	458420	tops or it was like, they were planning for 150 and I think it went, it was about what,
458420	460660	three hours and 15 minutes if you count the free show, right?
460980	468500	Yeah, it was pretty long and that steam deck giveaway thing was kind of, um, it was a mess.
468500	471300	Their player didn't work very well. Cause I actually watched it through that.
473380	477380	Thanks to my internet. I had that playing on one monitor and then I had the 4k version playing on
477380	483780	my main monitor. Right? Yeah. So it was a mess and like, and there is a funny, uh,
484100	490180	Oh God, there's, there's a funny screenshot that's out there. Like the very first one
490820	494820	was like a user by the name of like milf lover or something like that.
494820	500340	Oh yeah. Yeah. One of the first award winners. Yeah. So it was, it was just like
501780	505780	milf Hunter says Mike down Hunter. Oh, you're right. Milf Hunter. Yeah.
505780	512100	So everyone's just like, Oh, GG. And then eventually it like started breaking down
512100	516260	because it stopped showing the names and it started showing the steam ID. So everybody
516260	522020	assumed, Oh, the bots are getting it though. The bots are getting it. It's fun. It was a fun
522020	527140	distraction to watch chat one. Like, you know, I didn't want to watch what was on screen or
527140	531940	anything, but yeah, lots of big announcements and everything. So, um, can I, can I just,
531940	535460	can I speak before we get into the specifics? Can we just kind of speak in some generalities here?
535460	539700	I want to well also, and I want to go to Mike Defton chat who says it went for two hours and
539700	544500	40 something minutes. Does that count the pre-show or not? Because I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
544500	551860	The pre-show counts for me. Like, because especially when the very first thing they drop
551860	557940	on us is that dead cells, Castlevania. And I'm, I'm actually a little disappointed that that just
557940	562980	isn't a standalone game because when I first saw that I was super hype. I was like, yes,
562980	567860	this is what I want Konami to do. Give your fucking IPs to people that know how to use them.
567860	573300	Dead cell developers, great choice to do something with Castlevania. But it turns out it's
573300	578660	just an expansion for dead cells, which is okay. I'm still interested in that. That's fine. It's a
578660	583940	better direction than, you know, Castlevania probably done in house. But, but that was the
583940	588100	first announcement. And then what then they followed that up with, like, like there was like
588100	591700	some major announcements in that 30 minute little block.
592340	594180	Yeah, there was a new Hellboy game.
594180	599620	Yeah, that was. Sorry, Miltonias Games in chat says pre-show totally counts if it has world
599620	604660	premieres. I that's, that's what I'm saying. And honestly, they just need to fold that into the
604660	610740	main show. Like, let the ostrich lady or flamingo lady, excuse me, let the flamingo lady because
610740	617140	her outfit looked a little flamingo. Let that pre-show get folded into the main show. And she
617140	621940	can still, you know, have her thing. She's been doing that a few years. It should just really be
621940	625140	part of the main show. At this point. I'm not I'm not sure why they call that a pre-show. There
625140	630020	was the news coming out of that was way too big. One other thing I want to get out of the way
630020	635460	because everybody's talking about it. Too many people are talking about it. So it needs to be
635460	642500	addressed. And that is the literal child that got up on stage at the end and said whatever he said,
642500	647220	after Elden Ring won its Game of the Year award, right? We all know he went up there and said,
647860	652900	Bill Clinton, something something, which was interesting because social media immediately
652900	660180	said it was a coded white supremacy message. But unfortunately, social media has a tendency to run
660180	667140	with headline and literal Twitter size thing and not facts. And the fact is that he was a young,
667940	672980	because these these outlets have interviewed him after the fact they're giving him way too much
672980	679940	attention. But whatever it was, here's that attention you ordered. He was a literal child,
679940	686820	15 year Jewish, I believe, IRL shitposter. That's all that was. That was an IRL shitpost.
687540	692260	And the type of behavior you would expect out of a 15 year old child. That's all I'm going to say
692260	700500	about that. Because the onus on that moment, I think goes to Jeff and his security team and all
700500	705460	of that, like, how in the fuck did that kid get up on stage? So many, like, questions in the way
705460	711940	him being Jewish has to do with it. How How did a 15 year old get into the event in the first place?
711940	718980	Where? How did like, I'm assuming he's not from the area. So how did he get to the area to be on
718980	722740	the show? Well, anyone could buy a ticket. They were selling the tickets. Right. But like, you
722740	729380	know, I mean, if my child just disappeared. Oh, yeah, true. Where were the parents? Right? Yeah,
730340	734340	oh, yeah, you're just flying to California. Okay, sure. Bye.
736100	740100	Yeah, that's the thing. And Mike Deaf says, how the fuck did they let that happen at all? It could
740100	747540	have been so worse. Yes, it could have been an actual really bad message that gets out there.
747540	755940	And you know, is is gives the show and gamers in general, a really bad reputation. And that is the
755940	760340	type of unfortunately, shenanigans that and I, you know, Jeff Keeley's pissed that that happened,
760340	764580	especially when he goes out there and he tweets, we arrested the person that did the thing.
765540	770100	And you know, you could see that look on his face just looked like he was just pissed at the end
770100	776180	there. But the reality is, the fact that you let that happen in your security that you contract
776180	781220	with let that happen is what is holding your show back from being the Oscars. Although at the same
781220	785460	time, you look at what happened at the Oscars this past year, and I guess they don't have much
785460	793300	security either. So I'm not sure what this says about award shows at all. Right. Yeah, it's a
793300	797700	weird scenario. And it but it was like, almost like, it was almost nothing, because it's like,
798980	803140	okay, he said something weird, and then he disappeared. Like, and that was it. Like,
804900	808420	I don't know, I didn't even realize it was somebody that wasn't, I thought it was somebody
808420	814260	making a really bad joke. And then like, I didn't understand. I'm like, whatever. People are gonna
814260	818580	be weird, I guess. Yeah, I didn't realize it was like someone that wasn't with the group. And
818580	824020	that's fine. I mean, like, I get it. But like, yeah, it could have been worse. But it was also
824020	828020	really stupid to like, I don't know. Oh, yeah. And that's true. One of Matt brings up a point
828020	832340	and why I addressed it earlier. So when Matt says the reason why the Jewish thing came into play was
832340	837380	because people thought the Bill Clinton thing was a veiled anti Semitic comment. So Jason Schreier
837380	843540	interviewed him in Hebrew, and he understood it, and then pretended not to. So my point was
844100	850100	Yeah, right. It was that Jason Schreier. He's a sneaky, sneaky, sneaky guy. But that was so I
850100	855060	mean, again, it was a good, that's what a journalist does to pull a fast one. Anyway,
855060	859940	but but yeah, but but my point- Oh no, granted, not not everybody understands Hebrew.
860660	867060	But the fact that everybody was running with it was a terrible thing that this child said on
867060	873460	stage. No, it was just a shitpost. But granted, we need to take a moment to realize it could have
873460	878420	been a really bad thing. So anyway, that's all the attention I want to give that it's more than
878420	884180	enough done. The other thing that I think was the big like everybody's talking about it moment was
884180	888660	Christopher Judge's acceptance speech. Now look, I got nothing but love in my heart for Christopher
888660	894020	Judge. He did a great job and God of War Ragnarok. We all know his speech went on a little long.
894660	900260	And this is why the Oscars does a nominees luncheon ceremony to talk about these sorts
900260	905460	of things about keeping it short. I also want to point out something that really struck me
905460	910420	about that speech. And then the subsequent speeches were that they started to raise the
910420	916260	music up on Christopher Judge about five minutes into that speech, where I think the Oscars gives
916260	923060	you about 45 seconds. They started to raise me five minutes. Every subsequent speaker that night,
923060	929940	they started to raise the music a lot faster. That was a little inconsistent. And in my opinion,
930660	935140	kind of didn't look very professional at that point, because they they weren't doing it
935140	939300	consistently. And it looked like they were doing it because of what happened with Christopher Judge.
939860	947300	I just think that was a nobody told him how to do it. So he really just spoke from the heart
948260	952660	and kept speaking and kept speaking. And I understand there's a lot to say.
952660	959860	Look, this bitch and my bitches do a two to three hour show every week about video games. Okay.
959860	964900	Like, I get it. There's sometimes a lot to say. But in the context of these award shows where
964900	969380	you're paying people to be there and so forth, you do have to ask people to tighten it up a
969380	975380	little bit, right, you know, and plan on only the 45 seconds. So again, again, I felt that I felt
975380	981940	that a lot less on Christopher Judge and more on nobody preparing Christopher Judge or any
981940	986900	of the nominees. And then I guess the last thing I could say is the teleprompter seemed to have
986900	992580	problems a couple of times in the night. Al Pacino did not seem to be a fan of the teleprompter.
993300	1000740	Roberta Williams, I could see was not enjoying the teleprompter either. But it is what it is.
1000740	1008340	It's a teleprompter, right? So yeah. Let's see going to some comments in chat. Jessica in chat
1008340	1012500	says these people always saying something incomprehensible. Whatever happened to just
1012500	1018260	mooning the audience? I do want to remind that that child was 15. So not that one. But if we're
1018260	1024020	going to throw back to the Oscars streaker, who was 20 or 30, you know, then that Yeah, whatever,
1024020	1027860	whatever happened to a good old streaker? Let's let's let's
1028100	1029780	become desensitized to butts.
1029780	1034820	Let's how about that? I'd like to put out a challenge. Not really, because I don't want to
1034820	1039620	get in trouble. But I'd like to put in a fake joke challenge. I want to see a streaker at the
1039620	1044580	Game Awards 2023. Let's of age please. You know,
1045140	1051140	I referenced one of my favorite ever things to have ever come out of the Oscars. And it was the
1051220	1055540	Will Ferrell and Jack Black singing the Get Off the Stage song.
1056740	1059700	They said, Did you know that the Get Off the Stage song has words?
1060820	1066580	And I was like, every time I hear any Get Off the Stage music, I just think of them.
1067220	1071220	It's like the look at Catherine Zeta Jones. She's snoring.
1071220	1076580	Yeah, yeah. So that's the whole thing. If they gave lyrics to it, I bet everyone would would
1076580	1078740	actually get off the stage and just listen to the song.
1078740	1082580	I would worry about a comedy bit at the Game Awards, though. Well, I guess they sometimes
1082580	1087940	do like, they did like the animal thing, which was cute. Like, I'm always going to have room
1087940	1092740	in my heart for a Muppets moment. But it really just made me go, I wish the Muppets would host
1092740	1096180	the Game Awards. Not that I have a problem with Geoff Keighley. But I just feel like the whole
1096180	1101140	thing would just have more pep in it if the Muppets hosted, you know, like, Geoff Keighley
1101140	1105860	does feel a little vanilla at this point. And I don't know a nice way to say it. I'm not trying
1105860	1110740	to be mean. Again, I liked this award show a lot more than most of the others. It's just,
1110740	1113780	I feel like a little spice it up a little bit.
1114500	1114900	I don't know.
1114900	1119700	It also feels weird to have like Animal there without like, it tying into like, literally
1119700	1120500	anything.
1120500	1124740	Yeah, that's like, where was Miss Piggy unavailable? I mean, but again, I like Animal,
1124740	1130100	but it did seem like why that particular Muppet? I don't know. Where's the love for Janice and her
1130100	1140420	band? Or like, if we're gonna do some deep cut and Muppets. Let's get Scooter and Skeeter out
1140420	1143220	there to reaffirm that they are indeed Muppet babies.
1146020	1152100	All right. Yeah, that's a good one. Orangewright and Chet says, people on Mastodon were saying,
1152100	1156660	where were Statler and Waldorf? Now those are the Muppets I want to see at the Game Awards.
1156660	1157940	Yes. Yes.
1160500	1162580	Because they knew they'd have nothing nice to say.
1163220	1163860	That's great.
1164580	1168900	Then they just need to start like piping up when people take too long with their speeches.
1168900	1169380	Yeah.
1169380	1170180	Ripping into them.
1171060	1175220	You hear the small voice from the balcony. Boo! Move! Leave!
1176420	1179700	I would never do that, Chris, for Judge, though. But Questbuster says-
1179700	1180260	You know what I mean.
1180260	1184260	Yeah. Questbuster says, I'm sure Judge as an actor for years knew that he was running the
1184260	1188420	clock, but he was so emotionally invested in the moment alongside someone who was probably one of
1188420	1192660	the reasons for him getting into the craft in the first place. Oh, for sure. Again, I'm not really
1192660	1198500	faulting Christopher Judge in that scenario. I'm faulting what I believe or what I'm interpreting
1198500	1204980	was a lack of preparing Christopher Judge to say to all the nominees, okay, if you get selected,
1204980	1208980	you get a chance to go up on stage. Think about what you want to say in a minute. We have to limit
1208980	1212420	you to a minute, but we'll allow you to make a further statement online if you want to do that
1212500	1217140	at thegameawards.com, and we'll publish it on Twitter. But when you get 50 seconds in your
1217140	1220260	speech, you're going to hear the music come up, and that is the sign that we need you to wrap it
1220260	1224260	up. And then at a minute 15, we're going to take- like they need to just outline, this is how it's
1224260	1230900	going to go. And I don't think anybody did that. They need to make sure that they don't do it via
1230900	1237460	email, that they give them a physical card. That actually is a brilliant call out, because you're
1237460	1243460	right, it might have been in an email. I mean, people will gloss over email, and I bet anyone
1243460	1248340	who has any certain amount of notoriety is probably going to have people that check their
1248340	1256100	mail for them. Yeah, yeah. So I think that it needs to be sent out in a formal card. A card on
1256100	1265220	laminated. Something, an easy text, something that's eye-catching that says, here's how not to
1265220	1269940	be a shit. Do you think Jeff is- Do you think Jeff is going to send Christopher Judge an email
1269940	1273700	on Monday that says, per my last email? No.
1276500	1281380	Miltonius Games in chat says, this email should have been a meeting. Yes, that's why the Oscars
1281380	1285460	do a nominee's lunch, and that's when they talk about all that stuff. They buy them lunch at
1285460	1289380	least. So I think- They should have bought them lunch. Yeah, they should have bought them lunch.
1289380	1291940	Exactly. Come on. There's-
1291940	1295300	I would listen to people who give me free food.
1295300	1300100	That's right. There's my suggestion for the Game Awards 2023. I want to see a streaker,
1300100	1307060	and I want to see the nominees get bought lunch. All right. Okay, Loki, let's get into the weeds.
1307060	1309220	What were some of the other announcements of the Game Awards?
1310340	1315060	So anyways, again, I mentioned that there was a new Hellboy game based off the comics,
1315060	1322340	so Web of Word. And there's- Was it the announcement that Vampire Survivors is going
1322340	1326340	free on mobile, which is pretty cool. That was kind of a random surprise,
1326340	1330580	but I'm excited to see that. We got another look at Horizon
1330580	1335220	Call the Mountain, which looks pretty cool. I can't wait to check that out at some point.
1335940	1338580	Post Trauma, which kind of looks like Silent Hill.
1340260	1343940	I literally thought it was a Silent Hill thing, and I was like, didn't Konami already put their
1343940	1350900	cards on the table? Maybe that's the one that got rejected Silent Hill,
1350900	1354660	and so they decided to do something different with what they built. Sometimes that happens.
1355540	1358660	Well, not waste the assets. Not waste the time, yeah.
1359940	1365460	Viewfinder, which is a game that allows you to kind of alter the world with a camera.
1365460	1368020	And so it kind of- There's another one that's just-
1368020	1372340	I swear to God, I played a game like this at the Pop Culture Museum when I was in Seattle,
1372340	1376660	because you know they have an indie game room, right? And there was a game I played that was-
1377300	1380740	Sorry, I don't remember the name, but it was very much that same thing where it was like,
1380740	1385540	you look around in a picture, and then when you line it up the right way, it kind of turns into
1385540	1390580	something else. You turn it into a different thing. There's an indie game very similar to
1390580	1395220	this. And I honestly thought I was looking at a trailer for the indie game coming to PS5 or
1395220	1399860	something. Yeah, there's one like that where you can also grab objects and it changes size based
1399860	1405460	off of like perspective or something like that, which is kind of weird. Atomic Heart,
1405460	1412340	which looks pretty cool. It's kind of like almost like a Fallout or- I'm trying to think of the
1412340	1417620	other one that was like Fallout, but it's not. I can't remember it, but I did play it and I love
1417620	1424500	that game. But that looks pretty cool. There was Scars Above, which is like a sci-fi action shooter
1424500	1432580	game. Relic Hunters Legend, some online looter shooter. Among Us is getting a new hide and seek
1432580	1440420	mode. That looked pretty fun. They had that, was it After Us, which is like some sort of
1440980	1447220	platformer environmental type game thing. Oh, that reminded me of one you skipped over during
1447220	1451860	the pre-show or you said it so fast I missed it. Yeah, yeah. Returnal on PC. That got me very
1451860	1457220	excited. Just saying. Haven't gotten there yet. Oh, my bad. I thought that was during the pre-show.
1458340	1460900	This is all still I think pre-show. Oh, shit. All right. My bad.
1461460	1470180	Yeah. So, Replaced, which was a sci-fi platformer. Then there's also, they had another
1470180	1475780	trailer for Street Fighter 6, which is they announced there's going to be a 2v2 mode and
1475780	1479860	I think it's also supposed to be coming out in June now. I think they did date it. Yeah,
1479860	1484980	it looks real good. I got to say, yeah, like there's something about those even numbered
1484980	1491460	Street Fighters. And then I think this is getting into the show now. I know Hades 2, I think was
1491460	1496420	the first game that they announced at the show, which looked fantastic. That was huge because
1496420	1502020	Supergiant Games, haven't they said they don't make sequels in the past? And here we go. I mean,
1502020	1506340	but if any game does, I mean, honestly, all of their games could stand to have a sequel.
1507140	1513780	But Hades like double so. And Shane is in chat on time saying Hades 2 was the only thing that
1513780	1518020	mattered. I would disagree with the only thing that mattered, but I would say it was a genuine
1518020	1522900	surprise. It didn't get leaked in advance. And it was one of those things that definitely led way,
1522900	1527780	especially the fact that it was at the beginning and was a surprise. It's just like the beginning
1527780	1533620	hour of the pre-show plus the first part of the show just felt like, damn, like they really are
1533620	1536820	coming out swinging this year. And then unfortunately we got to the last hour of the
1536820	1540660	show. It wasn't that it was bad, but it was all kinds of stuff they kind of told you we would see
1540660	1547300	like Final Fantasy 16 and that stuff. So, but anyway, Hades 2, I'm all about that. It looks
1547300	1551460	great. I like that they're kind of changing it up and making it about Hades. I think it's Hades
1551460	1558660	sister, right? But they'll still have, you know, the gorgeous gods and goddesses art, but it looks
1558660	1564740	like generally the gameplay will sort of be similar. So, yeah. Yeah. And then we have the
1564740	1570980	new Ken Levine game, uh, which looks like Bioshock, but is not Judas. It looks all
1570980	1576660	spacey and kind of crazy. And I'm all about that. It's very much a spiritual successor.
1576660	1581140	Sorry. Shane says it's Zagreus' sister, not Hades. I, I did that thing where I said the
1581140	1586580	main character. I said, I said, uh, uh, Zelda is the one you play as in Legend of Zelda. I
1586580	1591140	had a moment like that. Sorry. So, but yes, Zagreus' sister, so the main character sister
1591140	1596500	in the game. But yeah, Judas looks fantastic. Uh, then suddenly out of literally nowhere,
1596500	1601540	uh, Bayonetta Origins, uh, Sariza and the Lost Demon, which looks.
1602740	1608100	Okay. I have something to say about that. The Bayonetta spinoff game. So remember when all
1608100	1614340	the Helena Taylor stuff went down a couple months ago, I just want to point out at that time I said
1614980	1618900	Nintendo and Platinum are going to be pissed at her because she just told you they're working on a
1618900	1623540	Bayonetta spinoff game. Now, to be fair, this is not the spinoff game I imagined. I thought they
1623540	1627060	were doing it with maybe some of the other characters in the mainline series and so forth,
1627060	1631940	but Helena Taylor told you they were working on a Bayonetta spinoff game. Because remember when
1631940	1637620	she said with it, with me or anybody else doing Bayonetta or something that she, she was using
1637620	1643940	this language about, you know, what, what types of games they do, or if they spin Bayonetta off into
1643940	1650740	a series and all this stuff. Like, so Helena Taylor kind of spoiled this game, but not really
1650740	1655300	because who could have predicted it was basically a different genre of game and a different art
1655300	1660100	style. It's interesting that the Bayonetta franchise is now at a point where it is making,
1660100	1664020	which is a great thing, but it's making these different like spinoff game types. It's just,
1664020	1671140	it's interesting. Yeah. And we got a couple more new trailers for, uh, Destiny 2 Late Fall and then
1671540	1677620	Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League, um, which looks interesting. They confirmed with the latter
1677620	1683220	one that Kevin Conroy is going to be voicing Batman in that as well. It was his last performance.
1685220	1689860	Got a trailer for a Star Wars Jedi Survivor, which looks pretty cool.
1690500	1694580	Some of my friends that are really into Star Wars were like losing their minds. It did look really
1694580	1699060	like, you know, I'm, I'm, I appreciate Star Wars. I think that's a good word. I don't know if I would
1699060	1702820	say like I'm a hardcore fan, but I appreciate Star Wars. And I could see that like the,
1703620	1709140	the putting together that trailer, that whole moment with, uh, what, what's the actor's name,
1709140	1712260	Cameron Monaghan or whatever that came out with the lightsaber and everything. Like they just,
1712260	1718020	they put that whole moment together very well for those fans. Yeah. Um, and then we have a new game
1718020	1724020	by the creators of Celeste that called Earthblade, which looks pretty awesome, kind of a similar
1724020	1731860	style game as well. Um, another trailer for Duke or Duke Dune awakening, no Duke Nukem game for
1731860	1738020	a man, Duke Nukem awakening. It's surprised to see this in the middle of this show. I thought
1738020	1741860	this would be something that kept towards the end, but we got the announcement of Death Stranding 2,
1742740	1752260	which Kojima finally shit. Yay. Refer to last week's show if you need to, but, uh, yeah. Uh,
1752900	1756980	no, it was, it was not, you know, it was nice to see that all confirmed, especially,
1756980	1762100	uh, with the rumors about Overdoser going around as well. Like it's nice to see like what,
1762100	1767860	like what actresses are, you know, are in the Death Stranding 2, what that all kind of looks like.
1767860	1773220	Um, I mean, obviously it still didn't make any damn sense, but neither did the first one.
1773220	1776180	It made a lot more sense when she got in there and played it. So, you know, I'm,
1776180	1781620	I'm assuming the second one will be very similar. I'm just curious if the second game is going to
1781700	1786820	play like the first game or is he trying to make it more actiony this time? I don't, I don't know.
1786820	1791540	I don't know. So we'll kind of have to see. Uh, we got a trailer for Tekken 8,
1791540	1800020	which looks like Tekken 8. Uh, yeah. Uh, Mortals of Avium, which, uh, is I guess a,
1801380	1806180	it's a game from Ascendant Studios who is comprised of people that worked on Call of
1806180	1812900	Duty and Dead Space. It's a first person magic based shooter game. So Hexen type of game, I
1812900	1823140	guess. Um, Nightingale, which looked, uh, kind of interesting. And, um, let's see Ballers Gate 3,
1823940	1830500	which was kind of surprising. Uh, Wayfinder, which was a online free to play action RPG game.
1831380	1835780	Uh, Diablo 4, I wasn't even paying attention to this trailer, but yeah,
1835780	1840020	we got a trailer for Diablo 4 and release date I think.
1840020	1845380	It looked, I mean, it's just a cinema cut scene. It had none, none of the actual gameplay was in
1845380	1852580	it. It was all just a hype for a release date, but, um, yeah, Diablo 4 looks really good. And
1852580	1855700	there's been, there was a press preview that happened this last week. And a lot of folks
1855700	1861780	are coming out saying, you know, it, uh, plays, um, like it has some of the best parts of two
1861780	1865380	and then some of the modernizations of three kind of all mishmashed together.
1865380	1870660	And some of the early, uh, impressions there are pretty favorable and, uh, you know, not,
1870660	1876500	not that, not that I, I mean, if, if I had played Diablo 4, I, I wouldn't be able to talk about it.
1876500	1881700	Um, but, uh, I, if I'd played Diablo 4, I bet my impressions would have been pretty favorable too,
1882260	1884100	but I guess we'll never know.
1886660	1893780	Um, horizon forbidden West burning shores. It's a DLC for horizon, uh, for Ben West
1893780	1901300	taking place in Los Angeles. So we get the Hollywood sign, uh, fire emblem engage.
1901300	1906260	It's a new fire emblem game. And I have as little interest in that as I do all the other fire emblem
1906260	1913940	games, um, blue protocol and action MMO. That's supposed to be coming out next year by Ben
1913940	1922020	dynamic and Amazon games. So we'll see, um, transformers reactivate. It's a transformers game.
1922980	1925860	That was a wild trailer for a transformers game.
1925860	1929140	I honestly thought it might've been a Titan fall game when I, you know,
1929780	1933620	Oh, good call. Yeah. But then, then it was transfer. I was like, Oh,
1934340	1939140	Oh man, Titanfall three would have been a great announcement, but for whatever reason,
1939140	1944020	no, we got another, uh, another scene from the super Mario brothers movie. This is like
1944020	1949620	something that was comprised of stuff that was in some of the other international TV spots as well.
1949620	1954900	Plus there was some new footage to it as well. Um, but it's funny, I guess. I don't know. I still
1954900	1960420	want to see it. The footage was cute and, you know, it, it, it kind of sold to me the same
1960420	1966020	thing that that second trailer did. And that is that the, the movie was definitely animated and
1966020	1970580	directed by people that really understand and have a love for the Mario to universe.
1970580	1975620	Cause there's a lot of deep Nintendo and in general catch like a lot of stuff like they're
1975620	1979700	talking about, like the antiques or whatever it's like, is this thing still working? Well, yeah,
1979700	1985140	you got to blow it in a little bit. Oh, I didn't even catch that. That's funny, but yeah, no,
1985140	1989220	there's a lot of, there's a lot of deep, there's a lot of deep cuts, like just all over that.
1989220	1994020	And so, yeah, I just don't, I hope that's honestly, I hope that's the only clip we see
1994580	1998580	sometimes with these movies, they release so many clips online and they'll, they'll all be
1998580	2002580	over social media. And it's like, I will have seen half the movie cause of clips on social media.
2002580	2008180	And it's like, honestly, let it be a surprise at this point. I you've shown enough. I I've come
2008180	2013620	around. I've got, I, at the beginning I was like, eh, I'll watch it on video, but now I'm like,
2013620	2016020	all right, I'll go see it in the theater. I want to see it. It's cute.
2016020	2024020	Uh, we got a trailer for a game called remnant to, uh, remnant from the ashes sequel, I guess,
2024900	2034580	um, behemoth. It's a meta quest VR game. They can let you be a Viking. That's neat, I guess.
2035300	2044020	Um, banishers ghost of new Eden. I'm not really sure exactly what type of game it is,
2044020	2050820	but it looks cool. Kind of game of thrones ish. Uh, Warhammer 40 K space Marine too.
2051380	2057620	Uh, it looks pretty awesome. Uh, meet your maker was kind of a neat little thing. So it's a game
2057620	2063220	rebuild like outposts, I guess. And then, uh, other people raid your outposts and you have
2063220	2072740	to put traps and stuff in them. So that's kind of cool. Uh, it's not exactly home alone with
2072740	2077940	it's like, yeah, Warhammer meets home alone. That's what I'm just imagining now, Kevin,
2077940	2087060	with the tank, um, crash team rumble, which I know has made some people, especially in my
2087060	2094420	circle, um, very happy. So a new, uh, four V four, uh, game that's kind of out of nowhere there.
2094420	2104420	Um, Lords of the fallen is got another trailer and it does look pretty cool. The one that had
2104420	2111700	me surprised, and this may buy maybe my new love instead of saints row, but crime boss rock case
2111700	2118740	city. It is the game by the folks that put together the, uh, payday series. And it is
2119380	2126900	got a, like a really like triple a actor cast and stuff in it. And Danny Glover, Michael Madsen,
2126900	2131380	there was a lot of, uh, okay. But yeah, it can base here. Okay. But Loki, do you know what I
2131380	2140740	called that game? Grand theft boomer. Cause it is all like all it's a list actors and actresses,
2140740	2147700	but they are all over the age of 60, which is what I'm totally fine with. It's fine, but I'm sorry,
2147700	2153380	it's grant that boomers, but it's, it's, I mean, I, I, they're pretty good too. Like I've watched
2153380	2158340	gameplay of it and it looks fantastic. If you go to the orange lounge radio list of dream games,
2158340	2163540	I believe many hundred episodes ago, we put a dream game on there called grandma's got a gun
2163540	2169460	and you know what, Kim Basinger here's her moment. So grant that boomer it is. Um,
2170660	2174900	and Oh yeah. Shane does point out since when is vanilla ice and a list actor?
2174900	2180580	Well, there were other A-list actors in there and, and, and vanilla more Michael Rooker, but,
2180580	2189780	you know, it's fine. I, I'm, it does remind me of like a San Andreas or, you know, like one of the
2189780	2196340	earlier, uh, saints road games where they did have like big name Hollywood actors voicing the
2196340	2202100	characters in there. And, um, I'm all about that, especially since saints road just doesn't know
2202100	2208500	what it wants to be anymore. So bye-bye. Um, so there's an announcement of Call of Duty's raid
2208500	2215540	mode, uh, that's coming out, uh, cyberpunk new DLC. So cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty,
2215540	2221620	starring Idris Alda, which looks pretty fantastic. Another person who could read me the phone book.
2221620	2224980	I know. I'm glad they brought him in to get people interested in that game again.
2225780	2228580	I think there'll be a lot of people giving that game a second chance.
2229540	2231940	Um, armored course six.
2231940	2232980	That was a surprise.
2233780	2236980	I thought for sure this was good. Yeah. I didn't know that was an armor. Well,
2236980	2240820	I knew about halfway through the trailer as an armored core game, but I thought it would be
2241620	2246740	kind of cool, like an armored core dark souls type game. Like, you know, make it that kind
2246740	2252420	of hard, but armored core, but it sounds like it's going to be an dark or a armored court,
2252420	2260260	Elden ring type game. So either way, I felt like you were quaking. When I saw that trailer,
2260260	2265460	I was like, Loki is shaking and crying somewhere about this. It looked pretty awesome. I was like,
2265460	2272100	Oh yes. Yeah. Um, and then Final Fantasy 16 looks pretty cool. I still don't know what the hell's
2272100	2277860	going on in that, but it looks cool. I just don't like the combat though. Like I'm such an old
2277860	2284100	person, but like I really, the action combat stuff in there just turns me so off of these games. I,
2284100	2288500	I really miss the old Final Fantasy combat system, but I'll try it again.
2290260	2293540	I caught Odin in the new trailer and that made me happy. Cause I didn't,
2293540	2297060	didn't see that Odin was one of the, whatever they're calling him.
2298340	2300660	Espers summons, whatever they call them in this one.
2301460	2305220	Why do we have to change it every single time? Just keep the same names.
2305220	2310260	That's what they do. Um, so, and that was that, that was, that was kind of,
2310260	2315380	I gotta say though, that was a weird thing to put last. No, I mean, I get there's a ton of hype
2315380	2318980	around 16 and so forth, but it was just, it was a weird thing to put last because we already knew
2318980	2324500	it was coming. So I'm surprised, like you, I'm kind of surprised that and the Death Stranding
2324500	2327940	2 thing didn't flip, although let's be real. We all knew Death Stranding 2 was coming too,
2327940	2331220	but maybe the armored core thing honestly is strong enough to have been the last,
2331860	2335620	especially with Elden Ring winning game of the year, you know, another From Software
2335620	2341700	venture being the last announcement I think would have, would have been worthy of that. So.
2342260	2342820	For sure.
2342820	2346660	Yeah. So how are we feeling about the game awards overall? Like,
2346660	2349860	what would you want to see different next year? If anything.
2350580	2351060	Shorter.
2353060	2358740	How do we get there though? I wonder if we can get shorter at this point. I do feel like.
2358740	2360740	It's its own version of the daytime Emmys.
2360740	2365380	I that's in some regards, it's actually not a bad idea.
2365380	2369540	I think the reason the length is what it is is because they're using a lot of this as
2369540	2374180	advertising to pay for the whole thing in the first place as well. So like, I don't know if
2374180	2378660	you necessarily need to make it shorter and I'm fine with it being as long as it is. That's fine.
2378660	2383300	Cause if you don't want to watch it, you can just catch the highlights the following day. I mean,
2383300	2389540	or even just after it, I mean, it's not a big deal. Um, I think it's fine. I think it's fine
2389540	2394580	as it is. There are things that are unnecessary that feel like, like what the hell is animal
2394580	2399140	doing there? Like that doesn't make any goddamn sense. Like, I don't know what, what that was
2399140	2404020	about other than, okay, I want this to happen. Yeah. I think there's just a few things they
2404020	2409940	have to tighten up. I understand they gave away a lot of awards at rapid pace too, but, um, it's
2409940	2413140	fine. I actually kind of liked Jamie's idea though. Cause a lot of people were saying
2414100	2418580	you have enough to fill up two nights and I almost wonder if maybe some of those pre-show
2418580	2422980	announcements shouldn't go into some type of technical award show. That's a lunchtime show
2422980	2427540	that happens, you know, the day before or a couple of days before or something. I almost wonder if
2427540	2435940	there isn't enough here to have two, two award shows, but like one is obviously a little more
2435940	2439300	like, you know, the one you're pushing people towards than the other, but then at the same time
2439300	2443060	you don't want to cut away from the other. So maybe brand, I know people are saying winter
2443060	2448500	game Fest, but maybe just, you know, have, have the whole thing branded as game awards.
2448500	2454820	And maybe it could be like Wednesday is the technical game awards. Thursday is the public
2454820	2459140	ceremony game awards featuring game of the year. And, you know, have it be two ceremonies. I really
2459140	2465780	think there is enough to justify that at this point. So yeah. Yeah. Um, she hold 10 and chat
2465780	2471540	says show more winners and less trailers. You know, I think a lot of people hesitate to say
2471540	2478420	show less announcements, but I actually think it could stand to curate the announcements a
2478420	2484260	little more. I'm not sure if everything necessitated the time it was given. And I know that
2484260	2489780	sounds really terrible, but especially I'm going to give an example, a game that was already
2489780	2496500	announced last year. That's giving a gameplay update should really get minimal space. Um,
2496500	2502660	if that, if not relegated to a prior award show, I think they need to curate a little more what
2502660	2509940	they're putting into this. But at the same time, you need, you know, all those ad dollars, you
2509940	2514660	need to sell so many ad blocks. So you need things to fill that space. And if it wasn't announcements,
2514660	2518740	then we'd be bitching about lame comedy bits or musical performances. So I understand it's,
2518740	2523700	it's a very tricky navigational game that Jeff has to place. But despite all this, you know,
2523700	2526900	feedback, it sounds like I'm just complaining, complaining, and playing about it. Actually,
2526900	2532260	I again, I feel like this was one of the better shows. This show is on a good path. They just
2532260	2537300	need to fix security, fix some of these logistical things. And I think it's going to be in a great
2537300	2544580	spot next year. But I, but yeah, I mean, there's just, you know, a few things just glare out.
2544580	2548580	That's it. Yeah. And SGA 100 Matt says they actually did show less trailers this year. It,
2549140	2552260	it didn't feel like it. I'm just keeping it real. It didn't feel like it.
2553700	2562340	bonds 006 says the past year highlights on Wednesday and the actual award on Thursday.
2564020	2569860	Ooh, I like Miltonius game suggestion, a gamer's choice night. And then the critics night. That
2569860	2574980	might be a way to split some things up to you could do those esport related awards and, you
2574980	2579940	know, streamer of the year and some of that could be in the gamer's choice night. You know, some of
2579940	2584580	those things that I really like that idea. That's a good one. So I think, I think he should look at
2584580	2588740	splitting the show a little bit. Um, and I know, you know, again, people watch three days straight
2588740	2593460	of E3. They'll watch two game award announcement shows, you know, if they're, if it's done well.
2594020	2603300	So, all right. Any last thoughts before we move on? Has anybody preordered, bought or whatever,
2603300	2611380	anything as a result of the show? Nope. I will definitely, uh, put Hades two on early access.
2611380	2617140	That's for sure. So I can play that on steam and then I'm probably gonna pre-order or pre-purchase
2617140	2621860	because now that's the thing we do now is pre-purchase, but for Diablo four, I'll do it.
2621860	2627380	So I've just, that's always been my favorite Blizzard franchise and my faith in four is very
2627380	2634820	strong. So, uh, I, I, I will pre-purchase it. So, all right, let's move on and talk about
2635380	2639940	instead of things we plan to, Oh yes. Mike Deaf says I will get Street Fighter six on launch
2639940	2646740	though. I think I was already sold on six, but now I'm like really sold. So yeah. All right. Uh,
2646740	2650020	let's get into our gaming weeks. Not the things we're looking for, looking forward to,
2650020	2654740	but the things we've already played. Uh, Dar Sakura, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?
2655380	2664100	It was the same way it usually is for me. Um, I, uh, I beat Cult of the Lamb and I'm going to still
2664100	2670020	be playing it a little bit more just to see if I can do some completion on it. Um, I don't want
2670020	2677700	to spoil the ending, but I, uh, I made a special recruitment as my decision. Um, I of course played,
2677700	2683140	uh, lots of Dead by Daylight, some off stream. I actually played with one of my newer friends,
2683220	2692500	Raven McPherse. Um, we played for a long time last night. Um, and, uh, Oh yeah. Final Fantasy
2692500	2696980	five. I thought I had beaten the game and I had forgotten there's more game after the first, uh,
2696980	2704020	big X death battle. So oops, more game. Um, more deathing, more X-ing.
2706260	2709620	The title of my stream was who, who names their kid X death anyway.
2710420	2711300	That's a good question.
2712180	2717620	Yeah. Um, and I was doing some word scapes. I'm trying to think of something else that I
2717620	2722900	want to play, you know, just to kind of, you know, change things up. My schedule changes. Um,
2723860	2727140	probably the week before, I think it's the week before I go back to work.
2727780	2734020	No, the week after I go back to work, which is going to be the 20th. Um, so, uh,
2734980	2742100	that's next month, by the way. So, um, I'm, I'm actually my days off are all going to be together.
2742660	2747460	So I don't know what that's going to do for what games I'm playing or what I'm streaming, but, um,
2748020	2752580	but I mean, that's kind of been the vibe right now is just, you know, playing the familiar,
2752580	2756660	playing the fun, you know, cause that's all I play for is familiar and fun right now.
2757860	2759860	Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with some comfort food.
2760660	2762500	I'm just trying to think of those, something,
2762500	2764420	something a little bit new that I want to do. That's all.
2765860	2767700	Uh, Loki, we'll go to you. How was your gaming week?
2768580	2774900	Um, I just played Minecraft. Uh, so I was finishing up, uh, an episode of channel 64.
2774900	2781940	So I did that this week and then, um, this whole week I'm taking off to work on content.
2782740	2787620	Of course, it'll probably not end up happening, but I am, that's the plan is to work on content.
2787620	2794900	So, um, I have three different things going on at the same time as per usual. So I've got, uh,
2794900	2799940	the monsters mechanics series. I started, uh, like a live stream of, um, want to live stream more of
2799940	2804340	that, but I have an actual like episode coming up for that, that I'm doing a build. So I was
2804340	2811380	gathering materials for that. And then I started, um, a vault hunters, uh, or on a vault hunter
2811380	2817860	server with, uh, some friends from the nerd craft SMP. So, uh, they're playing over there right now.
2817860	2822740	And I got to check out vault hunters, one 18 a bit, which is fine. If you haven't played it, it's,
2822740	2830340	um, the quick overview is that basically it's a, uh, different type of gameplay where you
2831140	2835300	gather materials and you go run these vaults and it's all about collecting loot. And then
2835300	2839860	with the loot that you get, you can also, um, level up and then you start unlocking like
2839860	2847700	different mods and whatnot. So it's pretty awesome, but yeah. All right. That's about it.
2847700	2853780	That's it. Um, my gaming week, um, as I talked about last week, world of Warcraft, uh, Shane's
2853780	2857860	in chat and we've been playing a lot together. I've been playing on my own. Like I have a character
2857860	2862740	I'm leveling with him and then I have one I'm leveling on my own. Um, but Final Fantasy 14 did
2862740	2866660	announce something that has my interest. So I think when you hear me talk again next week,
2866660	2870260	you're going to hear a little more split time because there's a new boogal tome event. And
2870260	2875140	if there's anything I love in fall fantasy 14, it's more fucking cosmetics, uh, as a reward. So
2875140	2880100	I do want to, uh, go back and experience that a little bit. So I don't know. I don't know how long
2880100	2884820	I can juggle two MMOs, but I had a lot of fun, uh, streaming at the other night. We did a stream on
2884820	2890820	Friday, question mark night, I think. So, uh, it was fun. Um, other games I played this week,
2890820	2894900	uh, I think I did some debt by daylight. I believe I was on one of your streams,
2894900	2898740	Dark Sakura. We played cause I remember you, me and Gwen playing a little bit one night.
2898740	2901780	We did. And we were also joined by a Loco Poco.
2901780	2904180	Yeah. Who has to carry us all. Yes. He's so good at the game.
2905220	2905860	I know. Right.
2905860	2910420	And what a hero he'll die on hooks so we can get out. So yeah, he was, he was a good sport. So,
2910420	2915700	uh, yeah, that was, that was fun. I had fun doing that. Um, I definitely need to make sure I joined
2915700	2919860	at least once a week. So, Oh yeah. Finara brought up her double finger moment or excuse me, her
2919860	2924820	double middle finger moment. So that was great. And I clipped it, but, uh,
2924900	2928260	you got, I don't think I was in that match. No, I was. Cause I remember commenting.
2928260	2933060	It was the three of us. So Loco Poco wasn't there. And we had, wasn't it a pinhead,
2933060	2939060	sweaty pinhead that was like slugging and all this stuff. I don't know. Like the, it was just,
2939060	2944180	the pinhead was just a pain in the ass and, uh, the chain hunt was going on. So everybody was
2944180	2949300	slowed, but thank God when the hatch spawned, it spawned like right near where Finara was
2949300	2952900	and she was able to get out. And that felt like a really good way to stick it to that pinhead.
2953620	2957540	Right in the hill there. That was beautiful. Beautiful moment. Beautiful moment. And that
2957540	2962100	actually also felt extra good because Finara was usually the first one to die on hook. So I'm,
2962100	2966660	I'm glad she got to be the champion in that match and really stick it to that,
2966660	2973780	you know, pee hitty. So, all right. Um, let's see what else during my gaming week. Uh, there was
2973780	2979700	that Dead by Daylight. There was, um, Oh, I've played something new. I played soul survivors.
2979700	2983300	So I've been into the survivors genre lately because of vampire. And I kept saying,
2983300	2986180	I'm good. I think I'm going to check out the soul survivors game. I've seen other people
2986180	2991140	streaming and so forth. I did download it and check it out. And it's, it's fun. I, yeah, it's,
2991140	2995060	uh, it's pretty addictive. It's one of those things where I'm like, I'll just play one more
2995060	2999060	round. And it's like 20 minutes later, my round is finally ending because I'm getting better at
2999060	3004740	the video game and, uh, I'm beating more Titan bosses or whatever they're called. So it's good.
3004740	3009300	It's a survivors game, but it looks, it's more modern graphics. It uses the more 2.5 D kind
3009300	3014100	of graphics as opposed to vampire survivors kind of looks like ripped off Castlevania art. Like,
3014100	3017460	I hate to say it, but it, you know, that's what it looks like. It's part of its charm though.
3017460	3021700	And I think what drove a lot of people to it, uh, this one has a little more original art,
3021700	3025620	but it looks really nice. And, um, it's, it's a lot of fun to play. So good. Uh,
3025620	3028820	Infinoris' poop clicker 20 minutes of what the hell did I just play?
3030500	3037300	Seriously, it's a cookie clicker three. Um, so yeah, there's that. Uh, and then, uh, yesterday,
3037540	3042660	some friends and I went out to do Pikmin bloom because it was community day in Pikmin bloom.
3042660	3048020	Keep in mind though, yesterday it was storming here, especially in the morning. So we were like,
3048020	3051620	how the fuck are we going to do a Pikmin bloom day? Cause usually we'll walk downtown or a walk
3051620	3056500	around the college or, you know, somewhere to get 10,000 steps in. And usually there's a community
3056500	3061300	day for one of the other Niantic games as well, be it Pokemon go or Ingress. And there really wasn't
3061300	3066340	this time it was just Pikmin was doing its thing. Uh, Ingress was having an event in Japan,
3066340	3071620	but it didn't affect anything here. So, um, we were trying to find a place to walk.
3071620	3076260	We tried to go to the mall out in Roseville because we thought, Oh, it'll be empty because
3076260	3082660	of the storms. People are going to stay home. Ha ha. That place was a disaster. We couldn't
3082660	3088180	find a parking spot and we left. So we were like, fuck it. So we left, uh, we ended up walking.
3089460	3094420	Yeah. I guess the, the need for the holiday shopping superseded the storms and people
3094420	3098020	staying home. We should have, I was like, I thought malls were dying. I thought,
3098020	3102180	I thought everybody was bitching about people going to online buying now, but boy,
3102180	3107300	you wouldn't realize it over there. So there's a cute little old town, not far from there.
3107300	3111780	We just went with a ton of pokey stops and Pikmin stuff. So we walked up and down there because it
3111780	3116980	happened to be sunny for like a two hour break right around the time we were not sunny, but
3116980	3121860	clear. Uh, so we, we got our steps in. Thank you very much. And that was a lot of fun. So,
3122740	3128180	all right. That was pretty much my gaming week. All right. Uh, let's move on and get
3128180	3133620	into some more gaming news and we'll start off Loki with another big headline from the week.
3134660	3142420	Yep. Uh, so the federal trade commission has sued to prevent the Microsoft Activision
3142420	3151460	deal from going through. And, um, of course, I mean, it's a weird thing. Yeah, I get why,
3151540	3158180	but also at the same time, discovery Warner, um, HBO or whatever else. I mean, it's like,
3158180	3162260	okay, let's come after Microsoft, but let's not go after these other guys.
3162260	3166980	I get, I also get why, and this is the way I phrased it, uh, when I was talking about it on
3166980	3176100	Mastodon is that my desire for the big fish to stop eating the other big fish is superseded by
3176100	3181220	my desire to see the management at Activision Blizzard changed. Uh, and this is going to get
3181220	3186740	that done. So it's, this is the whole thing where it's like, I, I don't love the big companies buying
3186740	3190020	other big companies. And I understand people are sick of seeing that in this industry.
3190740	3195380	Activision Blizzard in particular is a problem in its current state and it needs to be fixed.
3195380	3202020	And therefore I'm like government, just let this one go. But I, I, I understand their concerns.
3202500	3206580	Right. Uh, basically saying, you know, Microsoft has shown that it can,
3206580	3213140	it can and will withhold content from its rivals. Uh, today we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining
3213140	3217620	control over leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition, multiple dynamic
3217620	3223620	and fast growing markets. I completely disagree with that considering that we've already seen
3223620	3229460	that there's still, um, they were complying with the agreements that were in place already
3230340	3233700	for Bethesda games on Sony's platform. Um,
3233700	3236580	Minecraft is one of the top selling games on the switch.
3236580	3241460	They have their games on all these different platforms. They've committed to putting those
3241460	3248420	games on other platforms. If anything, Sony does that. I mean, it's just, it's kind of weird to
3248420	3254900	hear that, but whatever. Um, but in response to that though, they have entered in a 10 year
3254900	3261220	commitment to bring call of duty to Nintendo following the merger and as well as, um,
3261220	3264900	putting it on steam, even though I think it already was on steam. Yeah, it is. Yeah.
3266340	3269380	It will still be on steam for the next 10 years.
3269380	3274820	Didn't Gavin come out and say, thanks, but we trust you. Like, he was like, you, you didn't
3274820	3279060	need to like sign an agreement. You've, you've, I thought it was because Gavin kind of came out
3279060	3285220	and said, gave new, uh, uh, head of valve came out and said, like, you guys, we didn't need a
3285220	3290100	contract. We didn't need a contract and you should be able to merge. So he's kind of supporting it.
3290660	3296260	Um, which is interesting because if you think about it, Xbox on the PC and a game pass in
3296260	3300900	particular is kind of a competitor to steam, but that hasn't stopped Microsoft from releasing their
3300900	3307300	games on steam. Right. And yeah, Brad Smith, the Microsoft president said also our acquisition will
3307300	3310740	bring quality to more gamers and platforms or whatever. And that's good for competition. Good
3310740	3316340	for customers. Um, also wrote a thank you tweet and at Nintendo, Hey, any day Sony wants to sit
3316340	3319620	down and talk, we'll be happy to hammer a 10 year deal for PlayStation as well.
3320180	3321060	What were you saying, Jamie?
3322660	3323140	Nothing.
3323140	3330260	Okay. Sorry. Um, now a lot of people are also joking about LOL call of duty on the switch.
3331300	3334980	Um, I think there's some stuff to read in there that it's sort of,
3334980	3340420	I mean, we all know it's coming, but this doesn't mean that, that if they're going to support call
3340420	3344980	of duty for 10 years, it's all going to be on the Nintendo switch. I think this just screams that
3344980	3349860	call of duty will be on a Nintendo successor. I know a lot of people are also talking about cloud
3349860	3355940	gaming and yes, the switch can handle the cloud and all that stuff. I feel like what we haven't
3355940	3361540	seen at least on Nintendo's platform yet, uh, in America. And that's a key distinction in America
3362180	3368580	is multiplayer cloud gaming on the switch. Everything that's been released resident evil
3369140	3372580	control. I've been like single player stuff. I'm not saying it can't handle it or that it
3372580	3379060	would function much differently. I'm just curious if the cloud stuff is popular enough in the U S I
3379060	3384180	would really want to see what the sales of control or those things have looked like, because I just
3384180	3389060	feel like, yes, cloud gaming is a way they could do it. That doesn't mean that's how they are going
3389060	3395380	to do it. I'm not convinced, especially until in Japan, this is a different story, but call of duty
3395380	3400820	isn't a Japan issue either like that. I mean, I'm sure there are some fans over there that import it
3400820	3406100	just as, you know, we import stuff from there and so forth, but it's just, it's, it's a non issue
3406100	3411140	for the Japanese audience. I just feel like the cloud thing isn't really proven as a big sell.
3411140	3417700	Like you're not going to sell call of duty in large numbers on a cloud switch game yet 10 years
3417700	3422500	down the line, I think cloud gaming is going to be a lot more integrated even by Nintendo. And the
3422500	3428180	story is different. But I think this just sort of confirms Nintendo has got to be working on beefier
3428180	3432580	hardware. But at the same time, if they got no man's sky running on the switch, then shit, they
3432580	3433540	can get call of duty running.
3433540	3437620	Well, yeah, but like, just because you're able to like really,
3438340	3440500	just because they can doesn't mean they should.
3441140	3446420	You can super optimize that game doesn't mean it's a testament that it will run anything like it
3446420	3454340	really won't. And yet to the actual quotes we had from like, Nintendo. So Nintendo commented
3454340	3458180	by saying that Nintendo confirms the accuracy of the Microsoft statement, we have nothing further
3458180	3463620	to announce on the topic. And then gave new all his statement was we're happy that Microsoft wants
3463620	3469300	to continue using steam to reach the customers with call D when their Activision acquisition closes.
3469300	3474100	Microsoft has been on steam for a long time, and we take that as a signal that they're happy with
3474100	3479460	the gamer reception and that we're what we're doing. Our job is to keep building valuable
3479460	3484260	features that for Microsoft and all steam customer partners. Microsoft offered even says a draft
3484260	3487940	agreement for the long term call of duty commitment, but it wasn't necessary for us because
3487940	3493380	a we're not believers in requiring any partner to have an agreement that locks them into shipping
3493380	3501140	games on steam, or for future was a distant projects or whatever. That's a dig at epic.
3501620	3507700	Uh, be Phil in the games team at Microsoft have always followed through on what they told us.
3507700	3513620	And we do trust their intentions. And see, we think that Microsoft has all of the motivation
3513620	3520180	they need to be on platforms and devices where Call of Duty or wants to be. So yeah, I think
3520180	3525220	they're right. Yeah, it's got to be on like, as many platforms as possible. Then yeah, sure,
3525220	3530260	like down the road, you know, they can start trying to get more people on their platform
3530260	3535940	using that as leverage. But I mean, it I don't think that hasn't really been their strategy
3535940	3541460	with like a lot of things like them, you know, so I don't see why they would continue doing that.
3541460	3546980	That's why like, you know, when I look at stuff like this, like, I really wish the government
3546980	3552100	would come after like other companies a little harder instead, like we have, you know, Microsoft
3552100	3558340	talking about merging and they're not like saying, Oh, hey, yeah, we made them create Call of Duty
3558340	3561540	for next year, but then we just scrapped it because we're going to write it off as a tax
3561540	3565540	write off thing, you know, oh, even though it was done and everything when you guys will just never
3565540	3570100	play it because it's tax write off. You know, that's the stuff that like Warner Discovery
3570100	3577860	things going on. Yeah, like can get her Jade, get them. Yeah, they're canning fully made movies
3577860	3583060	and stuff. So it just doesn't make any sense. Like go after them. That's the type of stuff you should
3583060	3587940	be going after. But I get it, you know, any acquisitions that further monopolizes the space
3588500	3594820	you know, industry is not good. But like, I think I'll pick the lesser of the two evils here and I
3595540	3597700	would have them go after discovery. Yeah.
3598660	3603940	So comments from chat a lot of you have your your your opinions in chat for sure. She helped
3603940	3609060	10 and chat says if Sony and the FTC block the deal, Sony will buy Activision a year later.
3609860	3616740	You know, of course, they would try. Absolutely. And I think that's that that would be so shitty,
3616740	3620020	because Sony is a bigger company in some ways than Microsoft, especially with the whole TV
3620020	3625780	and electronics. And you know, I mean, like, it's like, it's doesn't. It's wild. Let's see
3625780	3630500	other comments in chat. DJ Rama says can't be a monopoly when you only have four to 14% of the
3630500	3638020	market. I mean, facts like, again, Nintendo is a huge, huge player in this space. And it seems like
3638020	3642980	they're totally being ignored by Sony as weird is weird. Well, look at what Sony does with like the
3642980	3648180	Spider Man property talk about monopolistic and not letting their thing be on other platforms.
3648180	3655140	Like they hold that stuff hostage constantly. So I kettle black. The only thing is I'm I'm going
3655140	3659300	to be interested if it does. So yeah, as you want to match this Congress is stupid and doesn't know
3659300	3667460	the facts. I mean, t but I actually the one thing about this process that I do like is that hopefully
3667460	3671460	it leads to I don't think it's gonna lead to televised hearings. But it'll lead to hearings
3671460	3675700	that are on the public record. Maybe it could it could be on C span, I guess you never know. But
3675700	3681460	it'll be a hearings that are on the public record. And number one, we're gonna get so much NDA locked
3681460	3686900	good shit that's gonna come out in the the papers and all that stuff like like we've already been
3686900	3691140	getting like the PlayStation six thing from last week, right? Like it's all fucking coming out in
3691140	3695300	these like court documents and stuff. So we're gonna get some good gossip from all this stuff
3695300	3701460	that goes on the public record. So that that'll be fun in some ways. And two, I'm kind of looking
3701460	3708100	forward to the way the Microsoft lawyers are going to drag Sony right back. And I think there's a lot
3708100	3712740	of this that kind of maybe needs to come out on the public record. And again, I'm not I'm not
3712740	3717940	trying to be anti Sony or anything. I'm really not I love all the gaming companies equally. But
3717940	3724020	as I said in the beginning, this particular merger, Activision Blizzard needs to change.
3724020	3730100	And this is how it's going to change. And it's no different if Sony just buys them next year,
3730100	3737540	you know, it just delays this whole thing. So anyway, and also as Joe and her Matt with a good
3737540	3742820	point, the difference is that gaming doesn't have lobbyists funded by multi hundred million dollar
3742820	3748420	or millionaire funds like tobacco and so forth. And also points out FTC hearings aren't normally
3748420	3752500	public or TV congressional meetings are but I think Congress is going to be backed up with
3752500	3759140	other nonsense hearings starting next year. That house might be but not the Senate. Unless the
3759140	3764100	Senate takes up the January 6, he has lobbyists for sure they do. Oh, for sure they do. They do.
3764100	3770980	In fact, there's a whole lobbying. The ESA is the lobbying group. Look at all the good they've done.
3773060	3780660	Yeah, yeah, that that and and to be fair to SSU 100. Matt, I too would sometimes forget that
3780660	3788660	there are lobbyists in the gaming industry. Dejirama S points out, you know, another like,
3788660	3793060	why aren't they looking at this type of issue? That Saudi Arabian media conglomerate, the one
3793060	3799540	that owns SNK Playmore? Why is that not being looked at? There's a like, you know, that's the
3799540	3804980	thing. If this is going to go to public hearings and stuff, then fine, let it but let's get all
3804980	3812180	the dirt out. Let's let's get it all out there. Let's get ugly. I want it to be the real housewives
3812180	3819460	of Silicon Valley. That's what I want those hearings to be. Prostitution whore. That's what
3819460	3826820	that's what I want Microsoft to do at those hearings. All right. Anyway, once the other
3826820	3831220	thing that Microsoft may have to answer to at those hearings, the fact that they're going to
3831220	3835380	be upping the cost of their first party games, but you know what, they weren't the first to do
3835380	3840500	it. So at this factor, I think they're pretty much the last of the big companies to do this.
3840500	3846740	But the inevitable has come much to Loki's delight, I'm sure that Microsoft's first party
3846740	3852820	games will be going up to $70. Starfield, Forza Motorsport, Red Fall will have the new pricing
3852820	3858020	there. This price increase, Microsoft said in a statement will reflect the content scale and
3858100	3864740	technical complexity of these titles. Also, Microsoft reiterating, you can still get these
3864740	3870980	through game pass $9.99 per month to start, you can guarantee the price of game pass is going to
3870980	3877940	go up to guarantee. So if you want to stockpile game pass, like before the new year, like again,
3877940	3882180	you're I don't want to tell you how to spend your money. And I can't predict the future. And I make
3882180	3887380	no guarantees. But let me put it this way, I personally will probably buy another year of game
3887380	3892900	pass and add it to my account. So I'm locked in for at least another year. Technically, you could
3892900	3897700	do it up to three, but that gets a little pricey for me. But at least for a year, I want to lock in
3897700	3903140	and be good there. I'll say what I said the last time we talked about the prices going up is that
3903140	3909700	I expect a $70 game, then it's $70 game is one that functions correctly and isn't followed by
3909700	3915300	a roadmap telling me how you're going to finish the game. That's, that's the way it works. Also,
3915300	3918420	I'm not going to create your games. So that's the other thing.
3919860	3923300	And what is the delay the game and bring out a finished item?
3923300	3927380	Sorry. Well, even when they delay the game, it's still bad. Like they did that with Saints row and
3927380	3932500	they delayed it and then it still was bad. Like it doesn't matter. Starfield has been delayed. So I
3932500	3938980	mean, I hope that means it is going to be a solid title. Again. I want to believe Phil Spencer,
3938980	3943380	I want to believe put it on my x files poster. I want to believe Phil Spencer gets it. I do.
3943940	3948660	Like, I feel like again, across all the gaming executives, I feel like he's the one that gets
3949300	3955060	the current like gamer mentality more than anybody. But the games have to speak for themselves,
3955060	3965220	right. And he's not infallible either. So anyway. But as pointed out, Sony has already been doing
3965220	3969540	this. Ubisoft's been doing this take two has been doing this. God of War Ragnarok, Assassin's Creed,
3969540	3976100	Mirage, NBA 2k, they're all 70 bucks. Also should point out this also isn't it's not just going to
3976100	3986420	be for game for Xbox series. This is PC as well is now at the $70 price. You know, I'm just I'm
3986420	3991220	gonna I'm kind of feel I kind of echo the thing. I'm like, I understand a $10 price increase,
3991220	3996580	especially in the day of you know, with inflation, blah, blah, blah. When cartridges used to be more
3996580	4002580	if you know you want to say that and so forth. But again, yes, give me a game worth $70. If you
4002580	4007860	put out half baked games, you're just going to encourage your audience to wait for a sale less
4007860	4012900	and less people are going to be willing to buy day one, which is what you want industry because now
4012900	4017940	look at all the games. They're not all coming out just for the holiday anymore. I feel like especially
4017940	4022260	looking at the game awards. It's either the very beginning or the very end of the fiscal year is
4022260	4025540	when they're trying to get all the games out now actually more at the end of the fiscal year June
4025540	4030980	Hello, they're trying to get all the games out by the end of the fiscal year. So that but if you
4030980	4036100	release at the end of the fiscal year, then you're trying to make a big day one or week one splash.
4036100	4043620	Like Final Fantasy 16 is releasing June 22. Right? That leaves it like a week and a half
4044500	4046820	in the fiscal year to move a lot of copies.
4046820	4052340	No, here's just another thing to throw out there.
4054260	4060500	What's to say that some of the price hike is to get the soup, the super excited people and then
4060500	4065460	they put it on sale to lower it technically back down to a regular, regular price.
4065460	4068980	Oh, we're already selling Gotham Knights that happened with like it was like Gotham Knights
4068980	4072820	was out what like three weeks and then it was on a Black Friday or one of those sales.
4073380	4078020	Yeah, so but this way though they can keep manipulating the market too.
4079380	4081300	So it's just all a bunch of bullshit.
4082020	4085860	Miltonius Games in chat says more people will wait for sales and the sales will come because
4085860	4091860	so much of the money is made with microtransactions. They need people playing the games.
4093060	4097140	Quest Buster says one nice thing about getting a PlayStation five late finding cheap copies for
4097140	4101380	games like Returnal. That's true because when Returnal comes out on PC, which I am excited
4101380	4104340	about, it's probably going to run $70 which I'm less excited about.
4106180	4110660	Gigi Romas says I'm bothered by the $70 price tag only because I've gotten so used to cheaper
4110660	4116180	prices during the PS 123 Xbox 360 era. Secondly, I still think it's bunked that the prices are
4116180	4120020	going to be that high. Yes, I do understand that the tech and research costs have gone up,
4120020	4123940	but the production media is still cheap. But I've noticed lately most places aren't selling
4123940	4129060	CD and DVD spindles anymore. So yeah. Um, you know what, though?
4130260	4137060	There are a lot of games that are still going to be 2030 bucks. Hades 2, I bet is a $30 game tops
4137060	4142980	$29.99. It wasn't even that expensive. Yeah, I think the first one was only 20. So yeah,
4142980	4148740	I at maximum, that's going to be a $30 game and maybe another $20 game. Vampire Survivors
4148740	4153940	making waves $5 game. So thank God for the indie scene and smaller developers
4154580	4161380	to still be providing a perfectly acceptable quality of game market out there as an
4161380	4167940	alternative. So it's it's just it's going to be very interesting to see how many people buy into
4167940	4173380	the $70 price tag. But then again, I'm part of the problem, I guess because I'm looking at certain
4173380	4179140	games and I'm like, yep, I'll pay it. I want to play that game. I know I'm going to have a good
4179140	4182660	5060 hours with this game, maybe more. So I'll drop it.
4187220	4191460	Some folks in chat are talking about cartridges in that whole era. Sjo 100 Matt says it still
4191460	4196980	amazes me the games were 60 to $70 back in the 90s. Granted, consoles did cost less. Yeah,
4196980	4200500	that's because all the tech was in those cartridges. Remember how much the Neo Geo
4200500	4205700	cartridges cost? But that's because you were- How much they cost right up until the end of the
4205700	4210740	thing. Because you're literally getting an arcade board in those cartridges. I mean, it's the tech
4210740	4215780	is in the cartridge, the console is in the cartridge practically. So I mean, it really it
4215780	4223540	really is like the cheapest one I ever bought brand new was King of Fighters 2000. And it was
4223540	4226420	the only one I'd ever seen that came out for under 300 bucks.
4227380	4233220	digital mess as I remember seeing Phantasy Star IV and Virtua Racing going for almost $100. Yeah,
4233220	4237780	I think because those games in particular had a ton of RAM on them, right? Like didn't they have
4237780	4242660	like 64 megs of RAM, which for the time was huge. I might be mixing this up a little bit. But like
4242660	4246980	they just they had a ton of memory on those cartridges. So those games because Phantasy Star
4246980	4252500	IV, huge game, Virtua Racing, huge game to run those graphics and such, you know, that's why
4252500	4256340	those cartridges got really expensive was because you had to put more and more memory on them.
4257300	4261220	Shane in chat says I think Supergiant can get away with the cheaper prices,
4261220	4266500	because you know, they make a crap ton off merchandise. Good point. Their stuff constantly
4266500	4271380	sells out and they couldn't even run their own store at a certain point and had to hand it off
4271380	4275780	to another company. Well, when you you know, when you talk about merchandising, merchandising,
4275780	4281620	when you talk about that, I think of Minecraft. And you know what, Microsoft only charges 20 bucks
4281620	4285860	for Minecraft. But write in line with your comment. There's a whole fucking Minecraft
4285860	4293060	aisle at Target these days. You know, like Minecraft is is huge. Fortnite free. Also
4293620	4300500	merchandising and obviously a shit ton of microtransactions and so forth. Yeah, I'm trying to
4300500	4304900	think what else is like Stardew Valley, Stardew Valley have merchandise now at Target. I'm trying
4304900	4309780	to think what other video games I see with merchandise at Target. Oh, Five Nights at Freddy's.
4310740	4311460	Another example.
4312580	4319060	One. And we'll see. I don't have seen Piggy. I don't know what that is. But I think it's a game.
4319060	4320820	Oh, yeah, it's a Roblox game.
4320820	4326340	Oh, that's why. So yeah, no, yeah, merchandising. You make a lot of money off that too.
4326340	4326900	For sure.
4326900	4328500	Wait until our Neopets back.
4330500	4336660	All right. Moving on Dark Sakura. Also some other some other good change in the industry, right?
4337300	4345140	Yeah, so this one is a very positive thing. So a Microsoft owned company called ZeniMax Studios.
4346580	4356180	They actually have just recently the the devs have anyway, have unionized 300 of them,
4356820	4361940	about 300. It's the QA staff at ZeniMax, including developers across Bethesda.
4362740	4366900	Um, and studios that have worked on like Elder Scrolls Online,
4368100	4378180	unionized with the communications workers of America. And instead, like the the union drives
4378180	4385140	that have been going on with some other companies. Basically, we're like, we're we're sticking to it,
4385140	4390340	we're going to keep at it. They the quote is saying we applaud Microsoft for remaining neutral
4390340	4394500	through this process and letting workers decide for themselves, whether they want a union.
4395460	4400500	The company is fulfilling the commitments they laid out in their labor principles earlier this
4400500	4404420	year, while sending a resounding message to the video game industry, the right to freely and
4404420	4408660	fairly make a choice about union representation should be in the hands of the workers, not the
4408660	4413460	management. So basically, we're all these other big companies, you know, like I said, Microsoft,
4414260	4421060	Blizzard, not Microsoft, like Blizzard and a few other companies have wanted to arbitrate,
4421060	4427460	you know, step in, control how the narrative goes, Microsoft is like, this is you, this is all you.
4431220	4438180	They also organized the QA at Raven Software and Blizzard Albany.
4439060	4446260	But the the managers at ZeniMax have been given very clear guidance to remain neutral.
4446900	4453220	Over about the next four weeks, the QA staff will either sign their union cards or vote through an
4453220	4458660	electronic portal. And with majority support, the union will then be recognized by Microsoft
4458660	4467060	and become the largest in the gaming industry. So good for them. Good on them. And good on
4467060	4473300	Microsoft for that, too. Yeah, I'm appreciative that Microsoft sort of sees the writing on the
4473300	4477620	wall. I think where this and the industry again, another reason why I'm like, I think Phil Spencer
4477620	4483460	gets it more than a lot of folks in the industry and is is letting this go through basically and
4483460	4490580	just letting it happen because it will whether they want it to or not. I like the the statement
4490580	4496980	from the spokesperson at Microsoft. I'll just read it verbatim. The recent organizing efforts
4496980	4502980	of ZeniMax employees and Microsoft is ZeniMax and ZeniMax's neutrality toward this is an example of
4502980	4507460	our labor principles in action. We remain committed to providing employees with an
4507460	4511860	opportunity to freely and fairly make choices about their workplace representation.
4514340	4517140	Oh, go ahead. Yeah, I'm just saying that that's pretty, pretty big.
4517700	4522260	SSJ100Matt in chat with a great comment. The industry is slowly getting unionized. It's a
4522260	4526020	great thing. Don't listen to the industry when they try to blame the unions for the higher game
4526020	4531220	prices. Good point because they will. Making sure workers are treated and paid fairly benefits the
4531220	4535780	people working on them and lastly, the games themselves. Great point by SSJ100Matt and quite
4535780	4541540	honestly, a call out to the gaming press and the press in general. When you're going to print these
4541540	4546100	CEO statements that are trying to blame the unions for the higher cost, you need to print what the
4546100	4552900	CEO made last year right in the same sentence. If you're going to print that sentence that the CEO
4552900	4560020	blamed the salary, then the next sentence should be Bobby Kotick made X million dollars in stock
4560020	4564420	X million dollars in last year. Those two need to go together.
4565060	4568020	The other thing too is you also need to look at the corporate interests of the people
4568900	4574340	of the companies that are reporting this information and what they're looking like for
4574340	4579300	their union policies. Just saying. It's a big picture.
4579620	4584740	Well, sadly, just in time before the holidays with Hanukkah next week and Christmas in two weeks,
4588020	4590740	our industry's not being nice to some people.
4591620	4600820	It's like a yearly tradition. Hey, it's Christmas time. You're fired. So, IGN has laid off some
4600820	4607460	of their staff as well, just before the game awards, no doubt as well. This affected some of
4608340	4616980	their content engineering and ad sales, part of a large restructuring across Ziff Davis.
4618340	4625140	So, don't know exactly how many are impacted yet, but quite a few people have lost their
4625140	4633540	jobs from there. Then of course, to go along with that, to get all your holiday shopping done
4633540	4641140	at GameStop, well, they're also facing layoffs as well. Ironically though, it is coming in the form
4641140	4648900	of engineering staff as well. Well, right now, they also don't know what the impact of, or how
4648900	4655940	many staff were impacted, but it is at least six software engineering staff that have confirmed
4655940	4663300	that they've lost their jobs there, but it's mostly impacted the blockchain wallet development
4663620	4669700	I was going to say, I wonder if it's because that NFT market landed like a turd, like it just like
4669700	4677620	no one, NFT, no one fucking T cares. I don't, no one fucking touched it. Thank you. Yeah.
4677620	4685060	The NFT marketplace, like that's, that's, that's unfortunate, but, uh, you know,
4685060	4689780	cause obviously the people making that were just trying to do a good job, you know, and I don't
4689780	4695460	fault them, but you know, it just, it was a bad vision by the executive in the first place who
4695460	4701220	I'm going to guess was not laid off as a part of this, but probably should be. But unfortunately
4701220	4707460	that is how this industry works far too often. So yeah, anyway, no one fucking touched it. So I'm,
4707460	4713700	I'm yeah, I, I, yeah, not the retail workers at this point. I mean, I'm sure that they've
4713700	4719380	also done different things to reduce head count for whatnot, and they were still restructuring
4720420	4724980	what they said. Oh yeah. Now that we're emerging from our rebuilding phase of our transformation
4724980	4730020	GameStop has a strong foundation, blah, blah, blah, which to pursue profitability in the
4730020	4736180	near term, substantial growth and blah, blah, blah. Um, it's not wealth that trickles down.
4736180	4743380	It's bullshit. Yeah. Well, it's, it's a sinking ship that they're trying to,
4743380	4749460	you know, shovel water out of. And the NFT was like trying to,
4749460	4756500	it was dumb, like trying to use a dime to stop, you know, a bucket size hole. So anyway,
4756500	4760660	like anyone could have told them that was, I mean, people did tell them that was a dumb idea,
4760660	4766980	but, um, they see dollar signs and it's different. Um, you know, going back to the
4766980	4770660	IGN thing a little bit though, I feel like, you know, media obviously in general has been
4770660	4775540	taken a hit, you know, obviously G4 and all that a couple months ago. Um, you know,
4775540	4779140	I was kind of thinking about like, why does media seem to really be taking a beating? And, you know,
4779140	4783460	when it was G4, I think we were just talking about, I think there was a lot of ways that,
4783460	4787220	again, management, it was mismanaged and I think mis-marketed. And I think they,
4787220	4792020	they spread themselves too thin with seven different preferences online. However, that
4792020	4797380	being said, I think there was just also a lot of, they had to compete with, you know, streamers,
4797380	4804180	YouTubers, and just other homemade content. And I think in the case of IGN, it's social media
4804980	4811940	and like, just honestly like accounts like Wario 64 on Twitter. Now I personally don't use Twitter
4811940	4817060	anymore, but I recognize the fact that accounts like, you know, Wario 64 and some of the other,
4817060	4821460	you know, gaming, what, Nebelion at a time. And there's just, you know, and other like,
4821460	4824340	God, it doesn't even have to be somebody that exclusively tweets about it. Just
4825060	4831940	when you have a curated list in general, wherever you're at, Mastodon, Instagram, TikTok,
4831940	4835300	you know, wherever social media you're at. I think a lot of people are kind of getting
4835300	4841060	their news as a part of that now. And if IGN doesn't have a smart strategy, like
4841860	4847860	IGN, if IGN's social media presence read like a Wario 64 feed, they probably would be in a
4847860	4856340	lot better shape. But it is what it is. Anyway. People.
4856340	4867540	Yep. All right. Moving on. Let's tell this is wild. So it came up on last week's show,
4867540	4873540	or maybe two weeks ago, that Yuji Naka had been arrested. He was detained about insider stock
4873540	4880180	trading, basically, that he knew that there was a Dragon Quest spin off or something coming out.
4880180	4884740	And he had bought some, some shares around that, you know, you're not supposed to do that. That's
4884740	4890420	what Martha Stewart went to jail for. Although, many people could argue that, you know, she went
4890420	4895700	to jail to be a symbol and all this other stuff. But I digress. Insider trading was hypothetically
4895700	4900340	what she went to jail for. So Yuji Naka is now being accused of the same thing in Japan. So that
4900340	4906820	happened a couple weeks ago. And now it's being reported, he got arrested again, about the battle
4906820	4910900	royale game Final Fantasy seven, the first soldier, which didn't they pull the plug on
4910900	4918260	that actually. But yeah, they did. But again, he bought shares right before the 2021 announcement
4918260	4922740	of the game. Of course, you probably know the name Yuji Naka from Sonic the Hedgehog being
4922740	4928020	the creator of that. But then of course, he worked with Square Enix on Ballon Wonderland.
4928020	4933540	So one would imagine he probably did have some inside thoughts as to what was going on there.
4933540	4938180	Of course, that will all have to be proven in a court. And I admittedly do not know how that
4938180	4943380	works in a Japanese court versus the US court. So I will just have to rely on the news to keep
4943380	4950340	me updated on what's going on with that. But yep, in this latest report, apparently he bought shares
4950340	4954820	in a team entertainment just before it was announced that they were going to create Final
4954820	4960740	Fantasy seven, the first soldier, he paid 144 7 million yen, that's over a million US dollars,
4960740	4966500	just over a million US dollars for 120,000 shares. He was arrested alongside Tai Suke,
4966500	4972500	Sasaki, a Square Enix employee, who also was arrested over that same aiming issue in the last
4972500	4984260	month. Interesting. So also to be noted, they released it mobile for, excuse me, they released
4984260	4989780	the game on mobile in November last year, and then less than a year later, it was shut down.
4989780	4994580	No word if he sold his shares before that happened. But I doubt it.
4996420	5000100	People don't pay attention. They think that they're going to be above it, that no one's
5000100	5002500	going to catch it when all this stuff is on the public record.
5002500	5008100	Yeah, it's just and it's it's hard for some people, I think to think with Yuji Naka,
5008100	5011940	you know, and again, this whole thing is alleged. So we can't say for sure. But
5011940	5016580	boy, fool me once shame on you and fool me twice. Right. But this whole thing is not get,
5016580	5020180	you know, it's like, Oh, he's the guy that we saw under the hedgehog. I love that game as a kid.
5020180	5026020	Well, some of our childhood heroes, it turns out are shitty people. It's unfortunate.
5027140	5030980	All right. I'm just like, what's the saying? Never meet your heroes.
5030980	5037380	Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. Anyway, let's let's try to focus on some heroes that are
5037380	5041700	hopefully less shitty in this next segment we like to do here at Orange Launch Radio every week.
5041940	5058020	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5058020	5062980	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
5064420	5068980	And while I get the video up here, Dark Sakura, what did you pick for tonight's
5068980	5077060	classic game of the week? It shows Street Fighter x Mega Man or cross Mega Man,
5077060	5081860	however you prefer to say it. Um, yeah, we're we're doing another fan game.
5082580	5092980	No, I love it. And a crossover. So the game came out on December 17 2012. I know I'm a little bit
5093780	5101860	within that 10 year period. But I think it's fine because we're we might be missing a week anyway.
5102900	5113540	So at any rate, the game was developed by a fan developer in Singapore named Sial Zong Hui,
5113540	5119140	I think I pronounced that right. And he did it as a labor of love, just a little, you know,
5120020	5127860	private development. And he sent an early build of it to Christian Zvenson, who is Capcom's senior
5127860	5134820	VP of consumer software at Evo 2012. And then he showed that and then he showed that build to
5134820	5140180	several staff members in the Capcom office. And Capcom's like, Hey, we're gonna help you out.
5140180	5148820	And he's like, cool. So he continued to develop the game based on his original design,
5148820	5154260	but Capcom took over the things like the funding, the marketing QA and decided to
5155540	5166260	distribute the game on on PC so that the creator wouldn't have to deal with license for console
5166260	5175140	development. And Svenson said that Capcom could consider console releases in the future,
5175780	5181460	but just chose to release it on PC so it could go out at its target date.
5183140	5191380	There were some concepts that were scrapped in its creation. But let me rewind a little bit and
5191380	5199940	tell you what the game is. So the game, it plays like a Mega Man game. It has Mega Man or Rockman
5199940	5206740	right in the front. And you go through their levels the same way that, you know,
5206740	5213940	Mega Man always does. But your bosses are Street Fighter characters. You have characters like Ryu,
5214820	5228420	you have Blanca, Chun-Li. I remember Rolento, Rose. What's the dude with the- I can't remember
5228420	5232820	his name now. No, not Dalsim. I know Dalsim is in there, but the dude from Street Fighter 3.
5234980	5244580	Oh well, I can't remember. Anyway, Crimson Viper is in there. But if you clear certain conditions,
5244580	5252340	you also can fight hidden bosses in the form of Sagat and Akuma slash Golgi at the end of the game.
5253060	5254340	It's not Urien, is it?
5257220	5258020	I don't remember.
5258020	5266420	Yeah, it's Urien. That's it. Yep. Okay. Anyway, back to the development on this.
5268740	5274180	Basically, there are other concepts that he had to scrap that Zangri did.
5275460	5280500	Yang was supposed to be in there, but was replaced by Chun-Li. Although his special
5280500	5287460	weapon is still included via cheat codes and he wanted to put alternate costumes for characters
5288180	5292820	and a second playable character where it's one of the Street Fighter people, but that got scrapped.
5293940	5298660	There were several complaints about the game crashing after it was released and also about the
5298660	5305860	user interface and the lack of a save system. So in response, Vincent said that there was a patch
5305860	5313620	being discussed and then it was released on January 28, 2013 as Street Fighter X Mega Man
5313620	5320340	V2 and it had a better user interface, better controller compatibility, bug fixes,
5321380	5328420	and a password system that looks a lot like the Mega Man Mega Man 2 ones and an additional boss
5328420	5336340	character. The music was all done in chiptune by Luke Esquivel, also a underscore rival.
5337140	5346420	Esquivel became evolved when he actually reached out to the developer to request being a full-time
5346420	5359540	musician for the game. He compared his own stuff with the previous musician and so he was brought
5359540	5366740	on. He combined Mega Man themes and Street Fighter themes for certain songs and he used elements like,
5366740	5379460	for example, Ryu's theme mixes with Crash Man's music. So it's pretty cool the way the two marry.
5381380	5386820	And then there's some completely original ones like the Wily map theme and the beginning of the
5386820	5396260	end theme and the soundtrack was considered so popular that the soundtrack got released. I love
5396260	5408340	it. There was an EP with four tracks that is called Street Fighter X Mega Man extended volume
5408340	5419860	one on February 8, 2013. It had four extra ones. It also had a remix of Ryu's theme,
5419860	5425940	Young's theme that was unused, Voice Collection and Sagat's theme. One of the things I have to point
5425940	5437860	out is how clever they mimic speech. If you go and listen to Ryu, even though it's not actually
5437860	5447780	synthesized speech, it sounds like he's calling out his attacks. I would say more based on the
5447780	5455620	Street Fighter II version of them just by mimicking intonation and tone from when he says
5455620	5466420	it. I think it's quite clever. But the game actually really did exceed expectations. They
5466420	5475540	haven't released any official real numbers for that first week but again they're like,
5475540	5482900	damn, this was enough that it caused strain on their servers. This was noted by Capcom
5482900	5490820	Senior Community Manager Brett Elston. And by March 3, 2013, the game had been downloaded
5490820	5503860	one million times. It got mostly positive reviews. The initial game had some very mixed reviews but
5504500	5513620	clearly they listened to people. They put out that better one. There were some people who were
5513620	5520420	just way too critical. At Edge, they gave it a 5 out of 10 noting inconsistent level design and
5520420	5525700	limited functionality is its biggest flaw. But I don't know. It plays like a Mega Man game.
5525700	5533940	I mean, it's not perfect but it's a really enjoyable game. The soundtrack is really part
5533940	5545460	of what makes it shine so I'm really glad that the developer went with A-Rival. It's just a great
5545460	5553060	game. It's absolutely worth bringing up. I have parts of the soundtrack on my permanent rotation
5553140	5560820	on my video game music soundtrack. There it is. Classic game of the week. Street Fighter
5561620	5570820	across Mega Man. For a side project, again, very impressive because this really wasn't an official
5570820	5576420	Mega Man game but it's kind of embraced. But it was enough that Capcom didn't notice.
5577300	5583620	It's dang impressive. I like that pick because I like this game and I like these types of
5584340	5591940	fun little side projects. It's the little fan game that could. It became a real game.
5592740	5597540	It did. It sure did. It didn't even need a Blue Fairy. It just needed Capcom.
5597540	5605940	But I agree. The soundtrack is a real highlight of the whole game. I can see some of the minus points
5606020	5609620	on the level design and so forth. You could even see it in those two stages.
5613620	5617220	At the end of the day, as far as what it is, what it brings to the table,
5617220	5621060	just the fact that they designed it all that way, it still deserves massive kudos. The game
5622260	5628500	had probably zero budget so it's amazing. I think it was cool that Capcom handled the
5629220	5633860	rest of the side of it. They did actually give some funds for development.
5634580	5636820	I'm glad they didn't pull a Nintendo and C&D it.
5638260	5643060	This is the thing that Nintendo needs to pay attention to. Look how lucrative
5643060	5652820	something like this could be. What if they had put it out for Steam for, say, two bucks?
5653060	5664180	Right? Imagine two bucks a million times. Just saying. It may be chump change, but it's change.
5666420	5667300	Matters to somebody.
5668900	5673620	All right. Well, thank you for that pick. Let's move on and cover some other video
5673620	5678420	game news around the industry in rapid fire news. We will start with Loki.
5679380	5688980	So the latest episode of The Simpsons brought in a nice cameo from Roblox or in this one,
5688980	5697140	it's Bo blocks, obviously. The whole premise of the story there is that apparently Bart was
5697140	5704500	playing like an Assassin's Creed VR type game. And because it's too violent, March made him play
5704500	5709780	a more kid friendly game. And that's where they got into Bo blocks. And then he finds out that
5709780	5715300	he can do some of the cosmetic items and sell them for real world cash because their computer is so
5715300	5722580	old. So it ends up this whole racketeering thing with Skinner and everything, trying to earn money
5722580	5727460	to, you know, fix up the school and stuff. And then there's like gang rivalries, other school
5727460	5732740	gang rivalries and stuff like that. So it sounds hilarious. It looks funny. I'll have to check it
5732740	5743540	out. But yeah, funny to see blocks and a Simpsons episode. And then I've still amazed that The
5743540	5750660	Simpsons is still on TV making fun of current pop culture. It's pretty wild. It is. And then
5750660	5757220	Halo Infinite is getting a cool update this month with a custom game browser. So all those things
5757220	5763940	in Forge now, you can check out and play them, which is pretty cool. And there's been some really
5763940	5771300	neat creations, everything from Andy's bedroom to I think I saw Princesses Peach or Princess
5771300	5776100	Peaches castle and they have like different game ideas like paintball and stuff like that. So
5777460	5783700	yeah, pretty cool. Worth checking out if you have a Halo Infinite or game pass to grab it or that.
5783780	5785940	Yes. All right, Dar Sakura.
5790580	5791940	You got the mute on Discord.
5794500	5801380	There we go. So for anyone who is a fan of the classic series ToeJam and Earl,
5801380	5809220	there is a movie in the works at Amazon Studios. Especially since there was the crowdfunded
5809780	5815220	game released just not too terribly long ago. But it's being produced by Unanimous Media,
5815220	5821620	the studio that was found by Stephen Curry, screenplay by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo,
5822420	5829380	both who worked on Hotel Transylvania and on Disney's upcoming Superfudge series.
5830420	5833380	I want to say I should have known about that. I love those books.
5834340	5842660	But also it's co-produced by Story Kitchen. So there's people with big names involved in this
5842660	5850020	one. But it doesn't say really a whole lot about it. So hopefully it'll go by the original game,
5850020	5855620	you know, just that they get marooned on earth and they have to put their ship back together
5855620	5862020	and leave. But I hope they keep the satirical nature of the game. So this would be
5862420	5867300	hopefully this will be good. You caught the attention of several people in chat with the
5867300	5872900	whole Superfudge reference, Tales of Fourth Grade Nothing, that whole thing. But apparently,
5873940	5877780	I did not know they were doing that again. Didn't they do a series in the movie or something?
5877780	5881620	And then a long time ago. It's been a while ago. Yeah, I can't remember either.
5882340	5886020	But I kind of would like something focused on Margaret.
5886020	5890260	Oh, a timely update for that.
5891140	5895940	I have I've read Are You There, God It's Me, Margaret, like when I was really little.
5896900	5901300	And because I mean, these books were written in the late 70s, I think.
5901300	5902180	Yeah, late 70s.
5903940	5910260	I would love to have an updated story for Margaret if they're going to try to update,
5910260	5916980	you know, Farley Drexel Thatcher, good old Julie, how I remember his name, for real.
5916980	5918820	And the baby's name Tootsie.
5920100	5923700	The one this is not the same author. But when I think of childhood books that were huge,
5923700	5927540	like around that age, when I were reading those books, like fourth grade stuff.
5928740	5932980	Thank you. Did you remember it says there was a Superfudge TV series in the 90s ABC Saturday
5932980	5938500	mornings? Really? I didn't know that anyway. Um, but I think of the Ramona books.
5939700	5945700	And they yeah, PBS did do see because that author died relatively recently,
5945700	5948740	like a couple years ago, and she was like 99 or so she was, you know, up there.
5950020	5952180	Encyclopedia Brown. Oh, my God.
5954180	5959380	Okay, I know that they made a movie for it, and I have yet to see it. But one of my favorite books
5959380	5966180	as a kid was from the mixed up files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.
5966180	5968020	Oh, yeah, they they did a TV. Yeah.
5968980	5972340	Yeah, I loved that book. I've read that book so many times. Like,
5972340	5974660	I used to have dreams of just moving into a museum.
5975940	5982260	Um, the other the other one would be the roll doll. But even though I, I believe wasn't wasn't
5982260	5987540	he kind of issue it but but I remember still reading like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
5987540	5991700	and I read the glass elevator, which elevator was an interesting story.
5992660	5996340	Did they ever make that they weren't going to and he his he denied it.
5997300	6002660	Because he was he was displeased with how the movie turned out.
6002660	6007780	Yeah. Phil of nine and chat says doll was canceled. All right. But But you know what,
6007780	6013380	I was like 10 when I read those books. So but James the giant peach was a huge one. I remember
6013380	6018900	Disney did a thing on that. So yeah, so. Wow. Dr. Seuss's Beverly clearly was 104
6018900	6022900	when she passed get out. I thought she was like late 90s. I mean, I know she had a nice long run,
6022900	6027940	but that's incredible. All right. Anyway, sorry. rapid fire news is turning into book chat
6027940	6033780	with the orange lounge bookie. Oh, anyway. And but here's the thing. Judy Blume is still
6033780	6039860	alive and still writing. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yep. As she says they did a remake of the witches
6039860	6044980	a few years ago. Yeah, apparently it did not. It kind of landed thud. I guess people didn't
6044980	6048980	want to see that one remade because it was very creepy. Didn't and it creepier. Yeah,
6048980	6052580	didn't Anne Hathaway put well, it was also true to the book, the grand high witch,
6052580	6057300	if I'm not mistaken, which was she played the grand high witch. Because you know, they
6057300	6061060	wait, of course, you know, but just for the audience, they completely changed the 80s,
6061060	6066820	which is the ending is completely different. But I believe the new one had the original
6067380	6074500	that the first movie had a happy ending. Yeah. Anyway, we thought that him staying as a mouse
6074500	6080580	was a happy ending. Oh, let's let's talk about some games that were out around that age. We
6080580	6087780	were reading all those books. And thanks to arcade archives. We got another game on the switch that
6087780	6092740	I'm sure is on its way to PlayStation as well. It's Pac mania was the game for this week. It
6092740	6100500	released on December 8 2022. This of course was Pac Man going 3d although it was more like 2.5 d
6100500	6106020	but that's what 3d was back in that era. And of course that infamous jump button that made the
6106020	6112340	game a lot easier. So you probably always got a little further in Pac mania than you did the other
6112340	6118580	games but yep, that is on the switch e shop and I'm pretty sure it's got to be on the PlayStation
6118580	6125300	four as well as those hamster arcade archive releases tend to be. Alright, let's travel
6125300	6130020	around the world and check out some games that will be out this week. Although I imagine it's
6130020	6136340	got to be slowing down. No, no, says Logie. No, there's not much. Oh, not much. Okay.
6137300	6142420	No, this week, though, we do have some big stuff. So we have crisis core Final Fantasy seven reunion
6142420	6147380	on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
6148020	6154980	High on life on PC, Xbox one and Xbox series. The Witcher three wild hunt on PlayStation five
6154980	6167060	and Xbox series. Looks like aka or aka on PC and it's in the switch. We have Akai katana shin on
6167060	6173700	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one Azure Striker gun volt three on PlayStation four
6173700	6183060	and PlayStation five black tail on PC, PlayStation five and Xbox series. River City girls two on PC,
6183060	6189460	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. And last but
6189460	6196420	not least, Megaton Musashi X on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation five.
6197780	6200980	Well, going to Japan and looking at the releases there. Yeah,
6200980	6205540	this crisis core Final Fantasy seven reunion appears to be worldwide. So it's on Japan's list
6205540	6210900	too. And that I did not realize that was still on deck for this year. That's a pretty big deal. So
6210900	6216420	that is coming out in the 13th. On the normal release day in Japan, the 15th we have some
6216420	6222180	other games for Nintendo Switch, including Akai katana sheen comes out them's fighting herds gets
6222180	6228500	its Japanese release on December the 15th. The cosmic fantasy collection is also out in Japan
6228500	6238580	on that day. And we also have WRC generations. Tetsudo Nippon real pro Tokyo Soko comes out as
6238580	6242900	well. And because we have to have a SpongeBob SquarePants game even in Japan the battle for
6242900	6249860	Bikini Bottom rehydrated not remastered rehydrated is out in Japan on the switch this week as well.
6250820	6258100	Also, if we go over to the PlayStation five, just that same crisis core rerelease
6258660	6263460	is out on the PlayStation five as well. Otherwise, nothing specific on the 15th.
6264180	6272020	How about Europe dark soccer? I have a literal handful on the 13th for PlayStation Xbox and
6272020	6278180	switch we have crisis core Final Fantasy seven reunion. And then Hello Neighbor on Xbox Hello
6278180	6284660	Neighbor two. That that that's all that's on the list. All right. All right. We have a few more
6284660	6288260	stories for you. And then we're going to be inviting you all to participate with our show
6288260	6292580	if you want to ask some comments in our chat, although you might want to hold off on any
6292580	6296420	questions till we get to that segment. But if you want to give us a call, you sure can. All you got
6296420	6302260	to do is have head over to our green room over at vog network.com slash discord. And I would
6302260	6307060	encourage you to join the discord server and, you know, discuss things throughout the week with us.
6307140	6311860	You know, a few stories in tonight's show roll were saved, or excuse me, were noted for the
6311860	6317460	show roll, because you posted them in discord, like the $70 game price, Microsoft, somebody had
6317460	6322260	posted about that earlier in discord. And I think we have one coming up to that also is from discord.
6322260	6328260	So yeah, we love to read and chat along with you all there. So I know everybody's trying to get
6328260	6332980	you to join their discord server. But I promise, it's a lot of fun over vog network.com. We don't
6332980	6339220	spam with the everyone in the here. So please, please head on over. All right. Loki, what do you
6339220	6348260	have for us? Yeah, so there's this really cool mod that's been worked on by this guy. Janae Gosar,
6348260	6356020	he's a developer in Slovenia. And it's basically a mod that takes the cities that you've created
6356020	6363300	in SimCity 2000, and ports them over to Minecraft. So these said, basically, the reason
6363300	6369060	why he made it was because there have been other mods out there, they've put in the terrain from
6369060	6375060	SimCity 2000 and import into Minecraft, but nothing with the buildings. So he went ahead
6375060	6381700	and coded it himself. And so it actually uses the SCG format from SimCity 2000. And you can then
6382660	6386420	pop it into Minecraft, it looks like he made it for a pretty old version of Minecraft, because
6387300	6394660	looking at the one he's flying around in is, it looks pretty old. But it does mean it does create
6394660	6400980	structures, at least in the areas where you would have had those buildings. And so you can even kind
6400980	6406820	of walk around some of them as well. There's like some basic interiors on some of them. But yeah,
6406900	6412500	it's pretty cool. A very narrow use case for that, but still neat.
6413940	6418180	So I was finally pulling this up, so I could see this myself. But yeah, probably has a very
6418180	6422420	limited use case. But it's one of those like, neat. So it's actually loading into save files
6422420	6425700	from SimCity 2000 and converting into Minecraft, because that's pretty cool.
6425700	6432660	I think what it does is it takes the save file from SimCity and converts it into a Minecraft
6432660	6436260	map. Yeah, as you can see, like looking at the textures and everything here, I mean,
6436260	6441220	we probably like with some tweaking, you could probably make it look even better.
6441220	6445140	Yeah, with the block palettes now, because I think, like I said, the version that he's running here
6445140	6449220	just based off of the glass textures and stuff. Yeah, and the draw distance is much better now.
6449220	6455060	Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is like this is very old. Like you could make this look way better now. But
6455060	6459140	that's still neat, though. It's fine. It's still it's in the quite an accomplishment.
6459140	6463780	Yeah, for sure. I mean, just that whole concept of like taking a save file in one game and using
6463780	6468340	it in another like I love that. Like it reminds me of how like what was it your Mass Effect
6468340	6471060	save file could be read by Frog Fractions too. Remember that?
6472420	6473700	What? Why?
6473700	6480500	I don't I don't it was part of the what? It was Frog Fractions, Loki. Why is the overarching
6480500	6482020	question? You know, that's
6482020	6484420	But for what purpose did it do that? Like
6484420	6489460	it was part it read something in this save file and affected the Frog Fractions story
6489460	6492660	because that's what happens in Mass Effect. But also
6492660	6497860	found that article from December 27 2016. Oh, really?
6499060	6501780	Yeah, Frog Fractions 2. Right.
6502980	6512340	And they said that it wanted to import data from Mass Effect 2 save files into Frog Fractions 2.
6512340	6520340	Upon doing so a second screen pops up. Well, welcoming Commander Shepard. And they
6521220	6528420	just it doesn't actually do anything. But it it welcomes you as Commander Shepard.
6528420	6534260	Okay. Then that's more akin to Psycho Mantis reading your save card and seeing Oh,
6534260	6537540	I see you like Castlevania. That type of thing.
6541060	6547940	Or when Cloud is all crazy and he says Xenogears when Xenogears was coming out, but
6548580	6552820	it was all spelled phonetically. As J-100 Matt making a good old
6552820	6557460	SimCity action news report saying the sun has gone down and creepers are storming downtown if
6557460	6566020	you hear hissing run. If you again if if you don't understand the SimCity and anytime this
6566020	6571460	fucking game comes up, we always reference the classic CD-ROM that had the action news and they
6571460	6579620	were very poorly public access channel level acted bits that would announce when monsters
6579620	6583620	were invading and all this it was just to show off the video on CD-ROM otherwise it was it was
6583620	6590420	just fucking SimCity. But it was it was so bad it was good. Anyway. But these these games and
6590420	6593140	these apps have come a long way haven't they Dark Sakura?
6593140	6606260	And in fact, here's another development. There's an app called Calm, which is like a mindfulness
6606260	6618420	app. And there it's going to have if you have a calm premium membership, you can actually have
6619060	6627700	the ocean of Sea of Thieves or the ambient noise of Zeta Halo from Halo Infinite playing in the
6627700	6634420	background while you're meditating and being all chill. If you aren't a member, you'll be able to
6634420	6639780	access that service for three months with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. And then after that, if you
6639780	6647380	want to keep using calm premium, you get a 50% off discount for the first year. Normally, the full
6647380	6656660	year is like 70 bucks. So they say that they Xbox teamed up with calm to support players mental
6656660	6663060	health and well being. It has a collection of Game Pass titles to address mental health as well.
6664340	6670580	For you know, to give a sense of escapism like Persona five Royal Hellblade Sanua sacrifice
6670580	6677700	unpacking and Stardew Valley. Fill a nine in chat asking a good question here saying do other
6677700	6683700	people use video game music for meditation and relaxation? I listened to Wow, and Minecraft a
6683700	6691220	lot to chill and relax. Minecraft music is super relaxing. Yeah. It's just it's interesting to me
6691220	6696580	to hear Halo alongside calm. I get that it's like ambient spaceship noises, basically. But
6696580	6703220	I just think of like, Xbox Live back in the day during Halo three, and I think stressed. That's
6704020	6709460	the other app. So anyway, yeah, deezerama SS persona five Royal should not be a game listed
6709460	6714180	for mental health. But it's it's it's not the game. It's the ambient noises and the
6714180	6718900	the sound effects and that whole thing. Oh, this one actually is a game that's listed
6718900	6725860	as to help. Oh, is it escapism or something? Oh, interesting. Well, aren't a lot of video
6725860	6736180	games escapism at the end of the day, I guess. Interesting. All right. Well, moving on. Let's go
6736180	6742580	back over to Loki. Yes, it's another week of what did Nintendo cancel this time? Or I should say
6742580	6747620	what did Nintendo cancel that someone else was working on this time. And today's episode is going
6747620	6756660	to be followed by or it is actually I believe did you knows gaming. It was the heroes of Hyrule was
6756660	6765460	a video they were doing about a DS game called heroes of Hyrule, which was a tactic. But Nintendo
6765460	6772260	has struck down because Nintendo being Nintendo. It was it was a pretty good video was a long one.
6772260	6779940	And they even put out like a bounty for, for something about it. But um, but yeah, they did
6779940	6784820	a really in depth episode. It was a really good one. I'm glad I got to see it before it was taken
6784820	6793540	down. Yeah, so of course, you know, you know, this is the heroes of Hyrule video was created
6793540	6798100	using the same process and video editing style for most of the videos on the channel. What sets
6798100	6803220	the video apart is that one of the few videos on the channel that documents piece of Nintendo
6803220	6811940	history that was first uncovered and reported on by us. But yeah, so that's unfortunate. It says
6811940	6817860	we've heard from several sources during the videos production that Nintendo was were becoming upset
6817860	6823540	with the amount of former Nintendo employees that were willing to talk about and share material from
6823540	6828260	unreleased games, failed pitches and other canceled projects. This did not deter us and
6828260	6833220	will not deter us from documenting video game history. As it should, as it shouldn't.
6834820	6839380	They do amazing stuff. And I interesting I did not know it was obvious I didn't see the video
6839380	6844180	but dark soccer kind of you bring up that bounty and I wonder if there's something about that,
6844180	6851060	that Nintendo really didn't like. I don't know. It's interesting. I don't know. I don't know. I
6851060	6860820	mean, it was, there was a lot more in the video. They really did have a lot of, a lot of former
6860820	6867140	employees talking as well, different, different like drawings and some different things that were
6867140	6873300	submitted. And, you know, the few screenshots, you know, there was about, they did a lot of digging
6873300	6879780	because this had been really buried. Yeah. Yeah. It had been pretty damn buried. Let me ask a silly
6879780	6883620	question, but I'm sure it's something someone on the internet saying this somewhere. Do you think
6883620	6889940	Nintendo pulls something like this? Cause they're planning on bringing it back? No. Or was this so
6889940	6893940	far gone? I think they're just, I think they're just doing this because it's, it's showing
6894980	6901060	Zelda stuff. And so they're like, no, that's so weird. They could, they could benefit from some
6901060	6905620	of that. Yeah. It's a part of video game history, you know, and I can't see in chats as Nintendo
6905620	6910260	preservation. What's that? Yeah. It's, it's so wild. It's a copyright strike.
6910260	6914500	It's just like the old, um, remember the old copies of Nintendo power that were in the
6914500	6919140	archive or whatever those got struck down too. So it's, it's, yeah. Cause that was really hurting
6919140	6926500	the bottom line. Yeah. But it's not anything. It's just, they're being jerks or protecting their IPs.
6926500	6930340	That's what it's always Nintendo didn't do it. They would, you wouldn't be able to have their
6930340	6934980	IPs anymore. It's like, I don't know about that though. Like they're not really, it's not like
6934980	6941140	someone's creating a game called Zelda out there that that's a little different than someone making
6941140	6945940	a documentary about a game that was canceled. That's not protecting their ID. That's just like,
6946580	6951700	we're just not suing you because that's, it's not something that was worth our time.
6951700	6957460	People do like the unauthorized behind the toll scene story about the cast of full house and
6957460	6961860	things like that, or these books and stuff. They don't get shut down, you know, even though the
6961860	6966020	stories are less than kind to some of the people that were on it, you know, it's one of those,
6966020	6971220	they don't, they can't shut that stuff down. It's, it's documentary from people that were there
6971220	6976260	telling what's going on and sometimes interpreted into a lifetime movie and that stuff. Or what was
6976260	6982020	the other one they did recently, the saved by the bell, uh, behind the scenes thing. And that was a,
6982020	6987540	you know, disaster too, but you can't stop that. So it's, it's wild to me that Nintendo can get
6987540	6991620	away with it, but it's because YouTube unfortunately doesn't tend to side with the content creators,
6991620	6993380	even though I thought they were supposed to start doing that.
6993380	6997540	It's well, right. But it's there. Well, they're not going to take a stance at all,
6997540	7003060	but it's more of, there is a process in place for this, but what that process would be is that
7003060	7010260	you counterclaim it or you, you say, listen, you know, I am, you know, not,
7010900	7014580	I'm counterclaiming your claim or something like that. Basically saying that, no, your claim is
7014580	7018900	wrong. I am free to use this. And then you take it to the courts and then tend to win because they
7018900	7023300	have more money than you. That's, that's really what it comes down to. And so, because people
7023300	7027140	don't want to take it that far. Cause they're like, it's not worth, not worth it for me to
7027140	7033460	be litigious about this, um, and defend this in court. So then of course, they're going to bully
7033460	7037060	them into whatever they want. Uh, did your, um, S and chat says,
7037060	7041380	Nintendo of Japan doesn't understand. That's why this is all coming out of the Japanese office.
7041380	7046900	And that honestly, you write. It's slowly going to erode away though. Um,
7046900	7054340	they're good will. Again, we need the gaming press that gets access to Nintendo to ask these
7054340	7057940	types of accountability questions. I realized they don't want to pick up the phone and just say,
7057940	7063060	why did you pull that video? But Nintendo will be sooner rather than later promoting a new Zelda
7063060	7071060	game, Tears of the Kingdom. And when that game is being promoted, it needs to be asked, um, why,
7071060	7076100	you know, uh, since we're talking about a Zelda game, you, uh, once had a Zelda game that was in
7076100	7080260	production and there was a YouTube video that was trying to document some of this for history to,
7080260	7083140	why did you copyright strike this? Why did you go after it?
7083140	7087860	They just promoted that game at the game. Then I'm saying that, but this is what the
7087860	7094500	gaming press isn't doing that they need to do. Ask these questions. When they're trying to promote
7094500	7097940	their product, you got to follow up with the tough questions, but they don't want to because
7097940	7099140	they'll lose access. I didn't realize they were working with
7099140	7105700	Zeltik on, on the video though. Zeltik is a really good, uh, Zelda lore person.
7105700	7108180	Yeah. Anyway.
7110180	7114660	I was trying to check some of the, the archives, see if maybe someone had put it up.
7115300	7118580	I'm sure someone's already. Oh, I'm sure once on the internet,
7118580	7123380	always on the internet. If that master file is probably a torrent somewhere now. So, you know,
7124420	7128580	I'm, I'm sure somebody within the, did you know, gaming side probably didn't let that
7128580	7133780	video go to waste and I don't blame them whatsoever. All right. Uh, well speaking of
7133780	7139140	Nintendo, I got one more story tonight and it's about Mario Kart 8, uh, Mario Kart 8 deluxe,
7139140	7143220	which of course was released on the Nintendo switch some time ago, but remains one of the
7143220	7146980	best-selling games on the platform. Like who doesn't have that game yet? I don't know. But
7146980	7153780	anyway, uh, wave three of the booster course pack just came out and with it, a new customizability
7153780	7158420	option for the items. Unfortunately, no, it doesn't let you customize the actual items.
7158420	7163060	That would be kind of fun to turn the mushrooms and things, uh, into other items. But
7164100	7168100	what it does let you do is it lets you, when you are going to play online,
7169220	7173700	you can play a custom items mode via the free update that brought the booster pack as well.
7173700	7180660	You can choose which items are used in offline versus races, meaning if you want to disable the
7180740	7188980	blue shell and only the blue shell, you can do that now. Yay. So that's the whole type of thing
7188980	7193860	that custom items is doing is, uh, allowing you to turn on and off what items you want to have
7193860	7197620	in the race. Seems like such an obvious thing, but it's nice that it's there now, you know,
7197620	7201620	probably one of those things that really did come through with feedback about I'm sick and tired of
7201620	7207300	those fucking blue shells. What can we do about it? So there you go. Uh, my depth also points out
7207300	7213700	the lightning item got nerfed that I did not realize. Interesting. It probably needed it.
7213700	7216820	Let's be real, but you could also turn that off. If you don't like that item,
7216820	7220980	you could, you could have it be, uh, green shells and bananas only. If that's what you want.
7222580	7227540	I'll just as fuck the blue shell. I actually have a pin on my old purse. That's the blue
7227540	7235060	shell that says fuck you. It's all blue shells. It's all or play a giant one
7235060	7240660	just so I could throw it at people. That would actually be really funny is like play a race.
7240660	7250020	That's all blue shells. Like everybody carefully not being in first right up until the end. That'd
7250020	7256420	be really funny. All right. Uh, that's, that's it for the stories we had on deck tonight. Um,
7256420	7261780	so we're going to look to you all in chat. If you have some questions for us over at twitch.tv slash
7261780	7266020	vog and network, we'll take those now. Uh, of course, if you want to, uh, give us a call,
7266020	7270180	you sure can over at vog network.com slash discord, just join the green room and we'll
7270180	7274260	get to some calls. Um, let me ask Loki though, real quick, if there's any, uh, last minute
7274260	7279220	stories or other things that came up that you want to bring up. Uh, right. Games is doing net ease
7279220	7286740	over hyper fronts saying that it's copying Valorant. They do look very similar. Um,
7286740	7293540	little too close. Yeah. Uh, all of our creative choices are mirrored in net eases game. Uh,
7293540	7298580	we don't think that changing the color of the character ability or slightly modifying the visual
7298580	7303300	appearance changes the fact that it's copyright infringement. It's like the old saying you can
7303300	7308100	put lipstick on a pig, but it's still pig. I love the fact that he added that the end,
7309780	7315540	um, comments in chat, um, on other games, uh, Phil of nine says I was shook when I logged into spell
7315540	7321060	break today and saw a countdown timer for the server shutting down. I had no idea. Only 29
7321060	7325060	days left. Yeah. I missed that. That game was doing the same thing for a DVD mobile.
7325780	7331060	DVD mobile's shutting down. It's going to be delisted, I think for revamp or something,
7331060	7337140	but it has to do with net ease. Oh, interesting. Huh? Yeah. Like they're saying like, if you want
7337140	7342740	to download it, do it now, which I think I already have it on both of my devices, even though I don't
7342820	7348180	play it. I think I had it once on my phone, but I got rid of it for the space. But maybe if I
7348180	7353300	have it in my history, I can still grab it. I don't know. Weird. Uh, that sometimes,
7353300	7360260	no, if it's, if the content is removed, then it's gone. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.
7360260	7365140	Then you'll need to like that, that may be emulator that made its way onto the store
7365140	7368740	that I grabbed on my iPad before it was removed. You certainly can't redownload that. So yeah,
7369620	7376580	they can, they can PT things that they have to, I get it. Um, let's see. Um, I can't see talking
7376580	7380900	about the Mario Kart story pointing out. It could be good for tournaments. That's true,
7380900	7383140	but look out. Cause if you hold a Nintendo tournament,
7385620	7389300	you might be up for a whole other disaster by the way. Didn't,
7389300	7394340	did, uh, didn't, wasn't there more follow-up on that whole saga this week? Like that guy,
7394340	7398820	that CEO resigned, I think I read. Yeah. They, they, they, they let the CEO go,
7398820	7403540	but well, he resigned to CEO, but he still owns the thing. So I don't know if that really makes
7403540	7411380	a difference allegedly. Um, so yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Uh, great question from, I can't
7411380	7416420	see in our chat. How do we email questions? I have a big one for next time. Please participate
7416420	7421700	at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send those emails, uh, fill of nine with a good
7421700	7426740	question. What are y'all gaming over the holiday break? What are y'all gaming over the holiday
7426740	7432900	break me? I don't have much of a holiday break, so I don't feel like I exactly have an opportunity
7432900	7437460	to get caught up on a backlog, so to speak, but I really want to finish Pokemon scarlet.
7437460	7441380	I really do. Like I'm missing these Charizard events and it's making me sad.
7441380	7444740	So I want to do, I want to finish Pokemon scarlet. That's for sure.
7444740	7455220	Um, um, I was going to say I'll do, uh, probably lead Minecraft. And then I do want to play high
7455220	7463700	on life a little bit. Cause that looks stupid. Nice. Um, um, we're probably doing our, our retro
7463700	7471540	game thing, um, on new year's Eve. So we'll see how that goes, but I'm going to keep playing the
7471540	7475860	stuff I've been playing. I might want to make a cameo. I think I mentioned that last week.
7476420	7480740	I'm booked until like nine 30, but you know, I'll come over for the actual countdown,
7481460	7488020	play some pinball. And if you, and if you want to, you know, actually, uh, play, uh,
7488740	7494100	on stream with me at some point too, or even not, I'm always down to play. I'm sure. Uh,
7494100	7498660	another question in our chat. Hello. Hello. Uh, poncho 72 is in our chat. Longtime listener,
7498660	7502660	first time viewer. Well, welcome. Thanks for being here poncho. Uh, I like the burger time
7502660	7507780	mentioning. So when we, for those that are only on the podcast feed and haven't been here on Twitch,
7507780	7513540	uh, poncho seat notices that I have an arcade one up, which is a burger time machine behind me.
7513540	7518740	Essentially it's a data East collection because it has, you know, caveman ninja has bad dudes and
7518740	7523620	karate champ are all on it as well. Um, but it's a burger time cabinet. And I always said from a
7523620	7528100	long time ago that if I could ever get a burger time machine in my house, I'd get one and the
7528100	7532660	arcade went up close enough. It's a limited edition too. They only made like 4,000 of them.
7532660	7538420	And, um, I was hoping to move some things around this weekend, but, um,
7539540	7544260	there's something waiting. That's all I'm going to say right now. I need to make a little space.
7544260	7547700	So, uh, tune in next week. That should all be taken care of. I have to get a,
7548260	7552660	I have to get an extension cord to set things up the way I want to, but, uh, stay tuned for that.
7552660	7557940	But anyway, uh, the real question that poncho 72 had here was, do you guys have any thoughts on the
7558340	7565060	Evercade thinking about getting one? Um, ironically, I mean, no Evercade, those, those
7565060	7571140	Evercade are the, um, the little portable devices that have the cartridges with packs on them. And
7571140	7576500	there was, there was a data East one recently because I think that data East one is on sale.
7577380	7585300	Um, so, uh, yeah, I, I don't own one, so I can't give you impressions. Uh, but I, I kind of want
7585300	7589380	one like that portable one that's coming out here. Pretty soon. They have a portable one and
7589380	7594660	they have one that you hook up to your TV and like the cartridges work in both. Right. Yeah.
7594660	7599220	It's all universal. Uh, as Joe and her mat says that Evercade exp was interesting. And then I saw
7599220	7603780	that story about their entire stock being stolen. Yeah. But there's a lot of, like, there's a lot of
7603780	7607940	cartridges for that, uh, Evercade thing now. Like, aren't they up to something like 20 different
7607940	7612900	cartridges at least. Oh, it's more than that. I think. Yeah. It's really been growing. I,
7612980	7619060	I want to get one. Maybe, uh, I was going to say I'll ask Santa for one, but Santa already, uh,
7619060	7628100	took care of business this year. So maybe in the future, 27. Okay. There's 27 retro cartridges.
7628100	7632260	So like a links collection, a code master in television, those types of questions,
7632260	7637060	37, I think. And then for arcade cartridges, they have another eight,
7637060	7643460	but then they have a Commodore 64 cartridge as well, which, you know, I'm all about that. So,
7643460	7647300	yeah, I kind of want an Evercade honestly. Yeah. They have like the Intellivision stuff. There's
7647300	7654260	also, um, uh, the, some of the nest maker people have games on there. Yeah. So it's not just love
7654260	7660340	to get mine on there. Yeah. Right. They have two, they have two collections of those. I will sell
7660820	7667460	I will sell very cheap, like very, very cheap. Yeah. You can just put that on there and fine.
7667460	7671220	You need to email somebody over there. How do I get myself one of the collections or something
7671220	7676020	or figure out the producers of the prior ones and figure out their email or something. There's
7676020	7680020	way there's ways to figure it out. Like, I know the people like that have had games. I like,
7680020	7684820	I recognize their games. I they're in the community. I just don't know like how you
7684820	7690260	would even get on these cards. Yeah. Pancho 72 says I almost bought the home and handheld one
7690260	7696180	for $150. So yeah, I I'm thinking about it. Like, you know, it's obviously this time of year kind
7696180	7700900	of stinks money wise, but that might be something I'm eyeing for early next year. I think the
7700900	7704980	Evercade is a pretty cool concept. So yeah, the home one now is only a hundred bucks too.
7706500	7711060	I still know what it is. I'm, I'm wanting, that's lots of steam gift cards.
7712020	7717220	So I can buy one game. Oh, the Marvel $100 costume edition.
7717220	7722740	Yeah. I want to play midnight sons and I want the season pass. So the ultimate edition is like
7722740	7724980	a hundred bucks. I understand.
7726820	7731700	It's annoying me and my love of having all the outfits and characters.
7732660	7738980	No, I get it. I get it. Um, as Joe and Matt says, I did see a review that the older Evercade
7738980	7743860	cartridges have problems with the exp, mostly just size. Like you can't get the card out of
7743860	7748500	the system when it's in, but there are a fair, apparently fixing the newer exp models. The one,
7748500	7753140	that's the ones that were stolen cheese. That's too bad about the stolen ones, but
7754180	7757460	well, thank you for the question Pancho. And if you do get your hands on an Evercade,
7757460	7761860	I'd love to hear more about it. Um, and I, I, it doesn't sound like anyone in chat has one yet.
7761860	7766180	It's definitely on my radar, uh, just because, uh, I love the idea of the, the fact that the
7766180	7771220	cartridges are home and portable. Um, but just to get the arcade machines, you know,
7771220	7776980	pretty relatively reliably on like the big screen, I think is always a lot of fun. So nice.
7777620	7781940	All right. Well with that, I think we're out of stories and that means we're out of show. So we
7781940	7786340	should go around and get everybody's final thoughts. Yeah. I, I, I, Oh yeah. I should,
7786340	7790340	I guess I should. I knew that, but the listeners didn't. Sorry. Yes. There was no email tonight.
7790340	7793540	Participate at orange launch radio.com. If you'd like to send an email for a future week,
7793540	7798020	which it sounds like somebody in chat did, which is great. Um, all right. Let's, uh,
7798020	7800980	go around and get everybody's final thoughts. I will say here at the end of the show though,
7800980	7805380	thank you so much for, uh, downloading our show and listening to it. Uh, or if you were here live,
7805380	7809220	that's awesome too. If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend,
7809220	7812180	uh, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
7812180	7816900	but we need more voices here to put out on air. So, uh, a nice five star review on a site like
7816900	7821780	Spotify, iTunes, wherever it is, you found the show that goes an awful long way. Uh, also just
7821780	7825540	sharing on social media is great too. Uh, you know, whatever you can do to get the word out,
7825540	7831700	we appreciate it all. Thank you so much. Um, that's all I have to say here. So let's get
7831700	7836420	final thoughts, dark Sakura. I imagine you are doing some Debbie delight tonight. I saw
7836420	7844500	an RN chat. So I imagine y'all are off to have some fun. Yep. Go ahead and move on into the queue,
7844500	7849700	opening up my game. And I would really appreciate it for people to hang around and chat with me
7849700	7854020	because that's the most fun part is being able to have a peanut gallery.
7854740	7859060	Uh, any final thoughts tonight? That was my final thought. Oh, okay.
7860820	7864420	All right. Oh no. Uh, give me steam cards. That's my final thought.
7864420	7870340	All right. Oh, what's your, what's your username? Dark Sarah, dark Sakura. Okay.
7871060	7874420	Just making sure we send this, just making sure we send those steam cards to the right place.
7874980	7880580	That's all. You'll see a neon cherry blossom. Okay. I'm pretty sure that's the one I'm using.
7881140	7885620	All right. All right. You can always issue a correction on social media if you need to. All
7885620	7890980	right. Have a good one. Have a good stream. You too. Uh, Loki, your final thought for tonight.
7891940	7897220	Uh, hopefully you'll see more content for me this week. I'm hoping to get a lot of it out.
7898260	7901220	Sounds good. Sounds like you're going to be hard at work this week.
7902020	7905300	Yeah, hopefully. Uh, my final thought tonight. I don't, I don't
7906100	7912260	have a lot. I'm just, um, just thankful to still be doing this show after all this time. And the
7912260	7917540	fact that there's people that listen to it means the world. And, uh, yeah, just, uh, the holiday
7917540	7921780	season is really sneaking up on us. So I hope everyone has a good one and, uh, 2023 will be
7921780	7928100	here before we know it, which I can't believe I'm going to be 45 next year. Like time fricking flies.
7928100	7931940	Can't believe it. All right. Well, that does it for another episode of orange launch radio.
7931940	7936180	I hope you all have a wonderful night. Thank you so much. And we will see you next time. Bye
