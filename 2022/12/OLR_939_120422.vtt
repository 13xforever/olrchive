Classic Final Fantasy games provided a fantasy. Magical, mystical universes, early industrial works at best. Those themes went largely unchanged into the reality TV show era, post-Survivor, Big Brother, etc. or at least were never emphasized until recently. Final Fantasy XVI is truly entering its teenage years, adopting mature themes of sex, drugs, and torture, and more appear to be in store for us.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.000 --> 00:58.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, once again with episode number 939 of our show for tonight, December the fourth of 2022.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me once again, welcome back to the show please DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Hey.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Hi, welcome back.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Hi, thank you.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
We missed you although our aim is always improving.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Always.

01:15.000 --> 01:29.000
Always. I hope you had a good, I know you kind of had to go because you were visiting your mom who, you know, you were talking about on the show previously but I hope all things considered you had a great time just catching up with people and all that stuff.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I have news actually.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh?

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
Mom. Well, while I was in Alabama mom got moved from the ICU to a regular room.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
And they took her catheter out. She was happy about that.

01:43.000 --> 01:57.000
I would be too. I think we all would. Yeah, um, she isn't losing as much oxygen when she moves around and though she's still losing some she's trying to do too much on her own, but they think that she might be ready to be discharged in about a week.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Oh good.

01:59.000 --> 02:14.000
But then she has to move in with my uncle and we don't know what's going to happen with her house and everything but I'm gonna say this right now, driving from Bay Monette to Mobile, and back in Alabama rain.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Dear people in California.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Never complain about rain again.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Because it's been raining here all weekend but this isn't rain.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
This has been a light drizzle compared to the shit I drove in.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
No, I get it. Everything's bigger in the south even the weather.

02:33.000 --> 02:43.000
I will say I will say though, I don't know if it's the lighting if it's makeup or what but you look glowing tonight a little time off is is great for the soul, isn't it?

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Well, um, I actually changed one of my lights to a warmer light.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Okay, maybe that's doing it too but-

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
And then I have a blue purple here.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Okay.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
And I have a wider light here.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
How many frickin lights do you have on you over there?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I have four.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
I have two panel lights that are about yay big, and I have a ring light that changes color and right now I have it set to blue and purple.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
I have a plain white, like my old ring light that's like this but I have it reflecting off of the metal of the desk you and I have the same desk.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
I have my other panel light right there that's warm light and I, it turned out pretty nicely.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
It does take good lighting and of course you know we are talking about visuals because we do tape live if you want to see us we do tape live.

03:28.000 --> 03:41.000
Every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby black wolf show and we tape live, so that you all can have your live comments to which pod culture with our first

03:41.000 --> 03:53.000
comment tonight, talking about dark soccer setup says there are four lights. Yes, there are indeed four lights confirmed. And by the way for those who aren't live there's always the VOD.

03:53.000 --> 04:09.000
There is the VOD available to our subscribers over twitch.tv slash VOG network, but of course, free as a podcast, as it's been ever since when did we start, I mean the show started in 2002 when a podcast start 2004 I think is when the podcast started free

04:09.000 --> 04:38.000
this has been since the beginning and that's that's not going to change. So yeah, also say hello to something that's been here from the very beginning and isn't going to change. Say hello to tech master Loki. Hello. Hi, Loki, how are you? I'm doing fine. What is you have a very retro game playing behind you tonight as we are broadcasting. It's not a retro game. It's not a retro game. It's a retro inspired game. Clearly, it's a game with that one right now that's a game within a game. But if I restart the video, it's a holiday game.

04:38.000 --> 05:07.000
It's a holiday game, obviously, because it's a Frog Fraction holiday. What is it? No. I Oh, is it Die Hard? It's Die Hard the arcade. Oh, okay. I see what you did there. Gotcha. All right, good. Good. I'm sorry, I'm still going to to this day say that Gremlins is the better Christmas movie. It's, um, yeah, I guess that's a game within a game. I don't remember playing that game within a game.

05:07.000 --> 05:26.920
Game within a game. But um, yeah, I played this at the arcade quite a bit. I think I think the Die Hard argument is tired. Yes, Die Hard is a holiday movie. Let's move on. My favorite Christmas movie is Batman Returns. That's my favorite Christmas movie. I'm sorry. I try to watch it every holiday. Don't you know Batman Returns was good. I was like, Don't be sorry. It's a great movie.

05:27.920 --> 05:39.920
Um, well, and actually my favorite actual like Christmasy movie that I like is Elf. It's funny because I don't like Will Ferrell. And I don't really like comedies that much not like that. And I love this movie.

05:39.920 --> 05:55.440
I guess I'm really cliche because I have memories of watching A Christmas Story, which I know is super cliche at this point. I think it's very symbolic of our generation. But my mom really loved that movie. And you know, so there's there's like, you know, a tie in with that. I wish I wish she could. Well, there was actually like a really shitty.

05:55.440 --> 06:01.920
I know there was a really shitty sequel. Now there's this the sequel that please don't remember the other sequel.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.640
Well, there's the there's the there's the hey,

06:04.640 --> 06:05.840
retcon sequel, maybe

06:05.840 --> 06:18.040
this no, it's the this is what we do in 2010 and 2020 is now we just reboot all the shit from the 80s and 90s with where are they 30 years from now. So that is the the Christmas the Christmas story story movie.

06:18.640 --> 06:30.240
Just people will either want to watch it because they want to recapture the magic or they'll watch it out of morbid curiosity, so that they can actually legitimately complain about it because they did see it.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.120
Some other folks. Oh, go ahead.

06:32.680 --> 06:45.000
I was going to say I did want to make out to the theaters this week and or I wanted to go see Violent Night, which unfortunately, the showtimes just weren't jiving with my free time.

06:45.480 --> 06:51.760
But that's another another Christmas movie in the same vein as Fat Man, which is just the best.

06:52.040 --> 06:56.000
That is like it is like if you combine Die Hard with a Christmas movie.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.880
Tiger Claw just brought that up in shadows to read that.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.400
Yeah. I what about stuff like Krampus?

07:02.440 --> 07:04.960
Is there not like a horror movie for the holidays?

07:07.600 --> 07:11.360
The only Krampus I care about is playing a is it The Trapper?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.600
Oh, yeah. Cute skin and DVD.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.440
Yeah. And it's funny is my wife actually liked Fat Man.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.520
Like she was like, I thought there was supposed to be a sequel.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.880
They haven't made a sequel yet.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.320
Oh, yeah.

07:23.320 --> 07:26.640
SSG 100 Matt says there's a Grinch horror movie coming out this week.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.200
That's right. Because it's the same guy that does.

07:28.400 --> 07:37.440
It's the same guy that plays Art the Clown from the Terrifier movies, which I I knew about those movies before they were cool because they had the director and a star here.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.800
Look, it's it's I can't watch it.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.760
I can't watch evil clowns.

07:41.800 --> 07:46.960
I sorry. Well, and those movies are violent with a capital B bolded underlined.

07:46.960 --> 07:52.280
It's just it's not my thing, but I understand it is some people's thing and cool for you.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.160
Like have fun.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.160
Have fun.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.360
Derail the topics again.

07:57.240 --> 08:00.440
So let's talk about the biggest movie trailer of the week.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.320
I was just gonna bring it up our minds.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.160
We're on the same one.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.960
Bear is seriously gonna be amazing.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.400
Like I cannot wait.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.720
Okay, maybe not that movie.

08:08.760 --> 08:09.320
Maybe not.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.840
No, the cocaine bear trailer legit looked amazing.

08:12.840 --> 08:13.680
I did see that.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.400
I did dark soccer.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.080
Have you seen this?

08:16.120 --> 08:17.080
You need to look this.

08:17.200 --> 08:24.120
There's a movie and it's like based on a true story or whatever called cocaine bear, which makes me think of that meme with the bear.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.520
That's like I fucking love cocaine.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.360
But apparently there was a bear that ingested a bunch of cocaine.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.720
But the thing is, they're taking a sharknado approach.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.160
It seems where this movie knows exactly what it is.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.280
And we love a self-aware shitty movie.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.920
Like it's going to be fantastic.

08:42.920 --> 08:44.400
I am there day one.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.360
Okay, we're sure.

08:45.800 --> 08:46.840
I thought when you.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.280
Okay.

08:48.280 --> 08:57.720
I thought when you brought up movie trailers from the week, because it isn't on our show roll, so I'll bring it up now and then we'll get into our kickoff topic.

08:58.040 --> 09:02.160
But there was a new Mario Brothers movie tweet or tweet.

09:02.160 --> 09:05.000
There was a new Mario Brothers movie trailer, probably in a tweet.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.360
People are already tweeting about it.

09:06.360 --> 09:06.840
I'm sure.

09:06.840 --> 09:07.320
I'm sure.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.840
And there was a whole direct Nintendo did about this.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.040
I didn't see the direct, but I did see the second trailer.

09:14.360 --> 09:26.040
And I have to say, you know why I have my reservations about who they got to play Mario and the fact that, like, this trailer just confirms he's just doing a second rate Charles Martinet.

09:26.200 --> 09:26.760
He's not.

09:26.960 --> 09:27.600
Here's the thing.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.160
Here's the thing.

09:29.280 --> 09:34.680
At least Captain Lou Albano and Charles Martinet were very different Marios.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.200
There were different approaches to the characters.

09:36.200 --> 09:36.800
They were different.

09:36.960 --> 09:42.280
I'm sorry, but what I saw in that trailer was second rate Charles Martinet, but it is what it is.

09:42.280 --> 09:47.080
I'm trying to move past that because literally everything else in the trailer I really enjoyed.

09:47.400 --> 09:58.400
I thought the fact that they're incorporating like Mario Kart type of elements into it and almost like Smash Brothers, maybe, yes, the way it looks like the stages are kind of like incorporated into it.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.880
Like, it looks really good.

09:59.960 --> 10:00.240
Yeah.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.120
Orange right in chat says Chris Pratt is not going to ruin the movie.

10:03.160 --> 10:03.680
He's not.

10:03.680 --> 10:04.960
Yeah, it's not.

10:04.960 --> 10:09.880
And I'm sure I'm willing to see it be a twist for who, you know, he ruins things.

10:09.880 --> 10:10.360
That's all.

10:10.360 --> 10:10.720
Yeah.

10:10.760 --> 10:11.160
Yeah.

10:11.600 --> 10:18.960
And there was a, I was at Target last night and there were Parks and Recreation dolls and one of them was of Chris Pratt's characters.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.600
I was like, ah, but I was like, but Parks and Rec is so good.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.240
Like he's not taking that from me.

10:23.240 --> 10:27.080
He's just not like that was back when, before he just was everywhere.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.000
That's what it is.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.880
Y'all like y'all it's, it's the oversaturation thing.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.440
I really don't have a problem with him.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.440
Like, I like the stuff he's in.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.560
Like, I don't know, except Jurassic World.

10:36.560 --> 10:37.360
That just is awful.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.640
But the problems are with him as a person.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.000
Yeah.

10:40.040 --> 10:40.280
Yeah.

10:40.320 --> 10:45.640
It's, it's, it's some of the ways he's treated his ex-wife and some of the other affiliations.

10:45.640 --> 10:49.800
But anyway, I'm not, I'm not going to let, he's not going to ruin this movie for me because...

10:49.800 --> 10:52.920
I file him under problematic faves for a lot of people.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.440
Yes.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.600
I don't care for him as a person.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.760
I, he's...

10:59.600 --> 11:00.440
Yeah.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.360
You can't pick one evil over another.

11:02.360 --> 11:02.720
Exactly.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.080
Exactly.

11:03.080 --> 11:03.960
So here's the thing.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.440
Otherwise, the movie looks really good.

11:06.440 --> 11:09.720
Like I don't want that to ruin what otherwise was a really good trailer otherwise.

11:09.880 --> 11:10.720
And let me say this.

11:10.720 --> 11:28.680
One thing I absolutely noticed about this trailer that I didn't hear a lot of people talking about is that if you want to talk about problematic fave, it seems that this movie took one of the most tired tropes that Mario is, that Mario is usually guilty of, which is the save the damsel in distress trope.

11:28.840 --> 11:33.600
And it looks like it's flipping that on its head because Princess Peach appears to be the sidekick character.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.840
And it looks like Luigi's the damsel in distress.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.920
Now, granted, it could always be a misdirect.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.240
It could always, you know, the trailer is only a trailer.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.720
But certainly we saw Princess Peach doing a lot of different things.

11:44.720 --> 11:49.440
And they're really rounding out her character, which I think is great.

11:49.600 --> 11:54.440
Like I've always loved Princess Peach from Mario 2, to be honest, and her floating ability.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.160
So I think they should all stand as equals.

11:57.600 --> 12:03.920
The Mario 2 quintet, I almost said quintet, the Mario 2 quartet should stand as equals.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.040
So I think I think it's cool.

12:06.160 --> 12:11.680
I will point out that she took that role because of palette swap necessity.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.280
However,

12:13.560 --> 12:15.240
hey, whatever the reason.

12:16.880 --> 12:17.200
It worked.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.200
I, I, I like her as a character.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.240
I played her 90% of the game.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.280
You know, when for Super Mario USA.

12:28.000 --> 12:35.800
And to be fair before it before everyone's because you know, I like like, look, I haven't used Twitter in weeks, but I already know I already can tell there's going to be people

12:35.800 --> 12:46.120
that are on there that are like, these fucking movies going woke with this Princess Peach in the night and armor woke this woke bullshit these woke movies doing this woke shit.

12:47.720 --> 13:01.480
Just so you know, if you were a real gamer, you would know that Luigi was already the damsel in distress in the Mario games in Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island, Luigi was the one needing saving.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.880
So this isn't exactly new to the franchise.

13:04.920 --> 13:10.800
So sit down, sit on it, shut up, delete your Twitter, make me a sandwich.

13:10.960 --> 13:17.720
The only thing that is being saving in Super Mario World 2 was our eardrums of Mario crying the entire time.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.000
Did you see the TV spots that they have also?

13:22.040 --> 13:23.240
Oh, no, I didn't see those trailers.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.800
No, different in different languages.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.520
I have TV footage in there.

13:26.520 --> 13:30.920
So well, nobody, but like it's on the internet as well.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.560
They had like different they're from different regions, obviously.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.560
And they had different stuff being shown.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.200
It means all good stuff.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.360
So it looks yeah, I've very exciting.

13:41.360 --> 13:45.400
I've gone from whatever about the movie to like, okay, yeah, I do want to see this.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.920
Like I want to take I want to take Dark Sakura and Loki.

13:49.080 --> 14:00.600
I want to go on a throuple date, whoever else wants to go can come to but I want to go on a date and go get a big tub of popcorn and just watch this crap and be entertained by it because it's going to be a

14:00.600 --> 14:01.800
bunch of nostalgia stuff.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.040
I'm I'm really into it.

14:04.040 --> 14:07.520
DJ Rama asked in chat says I swear if they make Daisy the damsel in distress.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.920
I'm going post apocalyptic.

14:09.040 --> 14:12.360
I don't think that you would already know Daisy's in the movie if that was the case.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.760
So I don't think that's happening.

14:13.960 --> 14:17.840
But who's to say that Daisy won't play some role in the sequel?

14:17.840 --> 14:23.680
Like I'm actively thinking about where the hell does a sequel go now from this point?

14:23.680 --> 14:25.920
Because I think that could be very interesting, to be honest.

14:25.960 --> 14:34.320
So and this idea that maybe they are setting up a metaverse with or multiverse or whatever with Donkey Kong, and all this other stuff.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.640
I it could be interesting.

14:35.720 --> 14:41.320
So Tiger Klein chat says I think having peach having a more active role is great.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.840
She has recently been playing in some of the games so makes sense.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.840
She goes on the adventure.

14:44.840 --> 14:45.200
Yes.

14:45.360 --> 14:50.680
And I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I've seen enough of this stuff over the years.

14:50.680 --> 14:54.480
I'm telling you, Charles Martinet is one of two things in this movie.

14:55.120 --> 15:00.520
He's Wario, like at the very end, and some type of setup for the next movie where Wario is the bad.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.200
I think that's less likely.

15:03.120 --> 15:06.440
Number two, and I think this is absolutely what it's going to be.

15:06.560 --> 15:12.240
He's going to be Mario and Luigi's father, which is a character that's never been introduced in the games or anything.

15:12.480 --> 15:22.400
And absolutely, Mario and Luigi's I bet Charles Martinet is going to play a parent or grandparent, some type of family member of Mario and Luigi's that we've never met.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.160
So we'll see.

15:25.520 --> 15:30.320
Come back, clip it, and we'll come back to this in a few months when the movie's out.

15:32.000 --> 15:32.480
Let's see.

15:33.120 --> 15:37.480
Tiger class says the movie mentions about galaxies, so it's possible we might see Rosalina.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.040
There's a leak of a toy that shows what appears to be Luma Lee.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.600
Ooh, I can't see in our chat.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.840
Welcome, welcome, says Jumpman.

15:46.080 --> 15:57.760
That's a really clever way to how to incorporate like a father figure for Mario and Luigi is that it could trace back to the OG Mario or Jumpman from the Donkey Kong games.

15:57.760 --> 16:09.800
It could tie into, you know, Donkey Kong being a brute now and all this stuff like I don't know, I didn't write the movie, but I could I could see where like the more classic Jumpman could be something that Charles Martinet is is actually playing.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.040
So I think that's a clever little way they could do it.

16:13.080 --> 16:13.760
So we'll see.

16:14.320 --> 16:14.720
We'll see.

16:15.080 --> 16:15.800
Anyway, all right.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.080
That wasn't really on our list of things to talk about tonight.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.880
But when we started talking about movies, had to talk about that a little bit.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.880
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks.

16:25.360 --> 16:29.920
But speaking of Nintendo, not all the news is good on Nintendo front this week.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.960
In fact, this is one this is I don't I don't know what else to say.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.920
Loki, this is just a mess.

16:35.120 --> 16:35.800
It's a mess.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.840
It's confusing is what it is.

16:37.840 --> 16:50.880
It's basically there was this Smash World Tour that was going on, and they had announced that it was, without warning, being shut down by Nintendo, who told them they can no longer operate.

16:51.520 --> 16:59.720
And of course, Smash World Tour is run by a third party group of fans who put together a bunch of these different tournaments.

16:59.720 --> 17:09.400
And I think it was like almost at the yeah, the annual championship was coming up with massive cash prizes, and I think they even had like a charity element to it as well.

17:11.480 --> 17:24.200
But now it's yeah, they're going to have a prize pool of was it $250,000 and they were even having planning on having a prize pool of $350,000 for 2023.

17:24.920 --> 17:32.600
But without warning, they said we were received notice the night before Thanksgiving from Nintendo that we can no longer operate.

17:33.320 --> 17:37.880
And we've so it there's a lot to it.

17:37.880 --> 17:53.720
So the Smash World Tour organizers, basically saying, you know, we don't know where everything will land quite yet with the contract sponsor obligation.

17:54.440 --> 17:54.840
Etc.

17:54.840 --> 17:59.080
In short, we will be losing hundreds of thousands of dollars due to Nintendo's actions.

17:59.080 --> 18:04.840
That being said, we are more we're taking steps to remedy many issues that have risen from the cancellation.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.240
So there is going to be working with that.

18:08.240 --> 18:20.200
But then, of course, there's also this drama that's going on with Panda, which is the Panda Cup, which is a separate entity whatsoever that runs another set of tournaments as well.

18:21.080 --> 18:30.200
And there's allegations that they're responsible for Nintendo canceling it.

18:30.200 --> 18:45.320
And because they're like animosity between the two groups or something like that, basically saying in November 2021, after Panda Cup was first announced, Nintendo contacted us to jump on a call with a few folks on their team, including a representative from their legal team.

18:45.320 --> 18:53.000
We were truly thought that we might be getting shut down, given the fact that they had licensed a competing circuit and partner in Panda.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.800
Once we joined the call, we were very surprised to hear the opposite.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.760
Then, of course, they had been reached.

18:58.760 --> 19:07.720
They reached out to know that they've been watching us for years and they, you know, wanted to see if we were interested in working with them and pursue a license as well.

19:07.720 --> 19:13.320
So originally they had kind of gotten somewhat of a license for 2022, but in 2023 was in the air.

19:13.480 --> 19:20.920
Then after all this, there's not a lot of time to 2023, especially if you want to plan tournaments, you got to get people more than six weeks to plan for it.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.640
And we're less like four weeks from 2023 at this point.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.920
So, yeah.

19:24.920 --> 19:25.400
Okay.

19:25.400 --> 19:25.960
Anyway, go ahead.

19:26.840 --> 19:39.000
Um, so then a Nintendo spokesperson, um, had told Kotaku, for example, that unfortunately, after continuous conversations with Smash World Tour, and after giving some deep considerations, we apply any potential partner.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.880
We were unable to come to an agreement with Smash World Tour for full circuit in 2023.

19:43.880 --> 19:56.280
Nintendo did not request any changes or cancellations of the remaining events in 2022, including the 2022 championship event and consider the negative impact on players who are already planning to participate.

19:56.280 --> 20:16.680
Um, of course, then Smash World Tour, um, organizers had been, you know, they disputed the statement saying that unfortunately, um, or, uh, as a last ditch effort, we, uh, asked if we could continue running the championship and the tour next year without a license and shift our focus working with them in 2024.

20:16.680 --> 20:23.800
We alluded how last year's function in the capacity with mutual understanding that we would not get shut down and focus on the future.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.920
We were told differently.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.600
Those times are now over.

20:26.600 --> 20:34.040
And this was the final, the final nail in the coffin given to, um, the very, our very particular relationship with Nintendo.

20:34.040 --> 20:37.400
This is when we realized it was truly all being shut down for real.

20:37.400 --> 20:44.120
We asked if they understood the waves that would make, uh, being forced to cancel and the Nintendo communicated that they were indeed aware.

20:44.120 --> 20:53.480
Um, but I remember them saying though, also that they they've also issued yet Nintendo's issued a second statement saying that, um, that's how you know, this is messy.

20:53.480 --> 20:58.280
I'm sorry, Nintendo actually, number one, Nintendo commenting at all is kind of a shock.

20:58.280 --> 21:03.960
The fact that they're commented on it twice, this is a communications disaster.

21:03.960 --> 21:12.200
This is a communications disaster, and you can hear it in these statements because very clearly everybody has their own perspective.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.160
Nobody can agree on what the fuck is actually going on.

21:16.360 --> 21:26.840
Yeah, cause they said that, uh, Nintendo's decision, uh, was solely based on our assessment for the proposals submitted by SWT and our evaluations of their unlicensed activities.

21:26.840 --> 21:30.840
This decision was not influenced by external partners like Panda Global.

21:30.840 --> 21:37.880
Any partner that we grant a license to has to meet some high standards we require when it comes to the health and safety of our fans.

21:37.880 --> 21:46.920
It also is important that our partners adhere to our brand and IP guidelines and conduct themselves according to professional organizational best practices.

21:46.920 --> 21:50.920
We use this same approach, um, to independently assess all partners.

21:50.920 --> 21:54.760
If we discover a partner is doing something inappropriate, we will work to correct it.

21:54.760 --> 22:10.200
When we notify SWT that we would not license their 2022 or 2023 activities, we also let them know verbally that we were not requiring they cancel the 2022 final events because of the impact it would have on all players.

22:10.200 --> 22:16.040
Thus the decision to cancel SWT 2022 was and still is their own choice.

22:16.920 --> 22:23.880
Uh, we are open to partnering with other organizations that will continue to offer licenses for major tournaments outside of the Panda Cup.

22:23.880 --> 22:31.240
Panda Global will continue to be a key partner and we look forward to receiving proposals from other groups and tournament licenses, et cetera.

22:31.240 --> 22:37.080
Um, I need Katie Porter and her fucking whiteboard right now because I don't understand any of this.

22:37.080 --> 22:43.400
I think it's fucking stupid anyways that you have to like license from Nintendo to run a tournament for a game.

22:43.400 --> 22:53.480
Like, I think part of it though is because you have to use their, uh, intellectual property and advertisement, the name of it, everything, it's all licensing.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.600
So that absolutely makes 100% sense.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.000
It's like SuperbOwl, that type of thing.

23:00.760 --> 23:01.260
Yeah.

23:01.800 --> 23:08.120
But yeah, um, Mike Deaf brings up an interesting thing, subsequent thing that has happened to make this even messier, uh, in chat.

23:08.120 --> 23:12.680
Uh, and I was reading about this online too, is that apparently a lot of Panda Global members have now quit the org.

23:13.400 --> 23:17.080
Because of this whole, you know, how often do we see this in gaming?

23:17.640 --> 23:19.400
It doesn't even matter what the news is.

23:19.400 --> 23:20.600
It's what's perceived.

23:20.600 --> 23:29.080
So in this situation, it definitely seems there's a perception there that Panda somehow strong are in Nintendo into shutting down Smash World Tour.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.320
I'm not saying that's what actually happened.

23:31.320 --> 23:39.160
I'm just saying clearly that perception is out there because 80% they're saying of people behind Panda Global are leaving.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.120
So now what?

23:40.120 --> 23:41.960
So, but I will say this, I will say this.

23:42.760 --> 23:47.720
Kudos to those people that work for these things.

23:47.720 --> 23:55.400
And, you know, don't, I don't think they're donating their time, but spend their time on these types of events and so forth for being able to walk away.

23:55.400 --> 23:59.320
Because basically they're saying, without us, you're fucked.

23:59.320 --> 23:59.820
Good luck.

24:00.360 --> 24:03.160
And they're effectively shutting down Panda by doing this.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.320
Uh, dark soccer, your mute hard mute on discord.

24:10.360 --> 24:10.920
There we go.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.040
I do wonder who could actually strong arm Nintendo.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.160
I mean, realistically.

24:17.400 --> 24:23.800
Well, Nintendo is not going to put on these events themselves, but I mean, they're just doing themselves a disservice.

24:23.800 --> 24:27.640
Nintendo doesn't really need the money or advertising.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.360
No, they've already sold the games and they've sold the DLC.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.840
I mean, this is just bonus.

24:33.400 --> 24:40.680
Yeah, no, it's just keeping the IP around for the inevitable sequel that will come out, whether Sakurai does it or not.

24:40.920 --> 24:47.000
There will be another Smash Brothers for the next system, uh, somehow, some way.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.040
Um, but yeah, it's just, you're right.

24:50.040 --> 24:54.200
Nintendo doesn't necessarily have a horse in the race at the end of the day.

24:54.760 --> 25:01.960
So it's just interesting that everybody's cutting themselves off to, to, um, yeah.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.680
And then at the end of the day, everyone is giving a different story.

25:04.680 --> 25:05.000
Yeah.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.920
And at the end of the day, it's the fans and the competitors that are suffering truly.

25:08.920 --> 25:14.040
And this'll just, this'll go exactly back to where I'm sure none of these people won it.

25:14.040 --> 25:21.720
And that is stores at com or excuse me, uh, tournaments at small stores, comic book shops around the country that there's too many of them.

25:21.720 --> 25:22.520
They can't shut them down.

25:23.160 --> 25:30.200
You know, homegrown tournaments, the way, the way we used to do it in the DDR scene, we didn't eat Konami's permission to do a fucking DDR tournament.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.160
We just did it.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.880
Cause Konami was like, here's some free shit.

25:33.880 --> 25:34.520
Actually, actually.

25:34.520 --> 25:34.760
Yeah.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.320
The Bay Area, they oftentimes donated stuff.

25:37.400 --> 25:41.400
So I guess maybe it's a terrible compare, but that was back when Konami was cool.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.960
Like, you know, now the whole joke is maybe Konami would Sue.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.480
If you tried to do it these days, uh, I guess there are so ridiculous though.

25:47.480 --> 25:53.560
Like, I mean, cause like you look at stuff like Evo and stuff like that, where they've had to take smash out because of this nonsense.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.720
So yeah, it's Nintendo.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.160
It's always Nintendo.

25:57.160 --> 26:01.720
It's always the understanding how to like interact with the community and stuff.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.880
It's just, I don't know.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.760
And I get it like, Oh, it's Japanese company.

26:06.760 --> 26:12.280
But that, that argument's only going to take you so far.

26:12.840 --> 26:22.760
It's, you know, especially now that we're in this era of, we know Nintendo is just as guilty of some of this or allegedly just as guilty of some of this union busting stuff.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.840
The way they treat their workers, their contractors or their full-time stuff.

26:26.840 --> 26:33.480
They, they are guilty of, you know, um, infection within the game industry, as much as a lot of other companies out there.

26:33.480 --> 26:34.440
Nintendo is not immune to this.

26:34.440 --> 26:37.960
So this whole excuse of they're just a Japanese company don't fly anymore.

26:40.120 --> 26:40.920
So, yeah.

26:40.920 --> 26:41.420
Yeah.

26:44.120 --> 26:52.840
Things that go beyond culture, you know, universally accepted things, especially when you're playing on a world market.

26:52.840 --> 26:53.240
Right.

26:53.240 --> 27:04.280
Well, and it's kind of like, you know, I realize it's a little apple to oranges, but you know, I think about the story we just had a few weeks ago about Square Enix and that really, really poor statement.

27:04.280 --> 27:08.680
From Yoshi P on why there are no people of color in Final Fantasy 16.

27:08.680 --> 27:14.760
And we had a whole discussion about Japanese developers are just, it's there.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.400
They, they don't see it the same way.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.000
It's not in their culture the same way.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.800
This is a problem in the Japanese development industry that needs to be addressed.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.560
Not just Yoshi P statement.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.440
Yoshi P statement is a symptom of that problem.

27:28.440 --> 27:43.160
So it would be interesting to see what Japanese developers kind of have to face in the next, you know, few years, because we've already had ironically Square Enix come out and say we need to make games that appeal on a global scale.

27:43.160 --> 27:48.280
And then they say that with one hand, and then the other hand, they do something to actively work against that.

27:49.640 --> 27:56.360
Anyway, and I do want to point out something that's going back from like old anime arguments, like from the 80s and whatnot.

27:57.160 --> 28:00.040
Technically, they're based off Japanese models.

28:01.880 --> 28:05.560
I mean, they're not really even I mean, in modern 3D games.

28:05.560 --> 28:11.640
Yeah, but just like people would have the same argument about anime, but technically, they weren't white there either.

28:13.000 --> 28:25.800
So anyway, my point is, this whole Nintendo is a Japanese company, and they just do things differently that the amount of times you can use that excuse is has run out for Nintendo.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.520
Like we now do business on a global scale.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.360
Video games is a global business.

28:30.360 --> 28:35.080
All of these things are global, like that certain things are just going to have to change.

28:35.720 --> 28:42.600
And the way they approach communication is one of those things that very clearly has to change.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.640
Again, I'm shocked they put out two statements to be quite honest.

28:46.760 --> 28:54.920
And I can even read between the lines on that second statement that apparently the Smash World Tour did something that they didn't like.

28:54.920 --> 29:05.800
But they're just not being clear in what that is for probably professional reasons, because it's not very nice to call out people in a very public way about what it is they did.

29:05.800 --> 29:11.960
But I feel like that's what the internet and the fans need to hear is what specifically is the problem.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.000
But we're not going to know.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.280
It's just that's that's how it is.

29:16.280 --> 29:19.160
We're never going to know unless it comes out in court.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.800
Maybe that's where this whole thing ends up in a courtroom somewhere.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.560
Sure seems destined that way.

29:25.160 --> 29:28.200
Anyway, less destined for a courtroom.

29:28.920 --> 29:32.520
Hopefully us and the video games we've been playing this week.

29:32.520 --> 29:36.520
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.920
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming month?

29:41.400 --> 29:45.320
I played, of course, a lot of Dead by Daylight.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.080
Been playing actually with a lot of different people.

29:47.800 --> 29:55.160
I ended up like doing the playing on Thursday for Thirst Trap, apart from my own streams.

29:55.160 --> 30:03.560
And then for the last two weeks in a row, I always would get an invite from Intoxicated to play as well.

30:04.200 --> 30:09.720
So I've been on like seven hour Dead by Daylight binges where thankfully I don't have to do a lot of talking.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.920
But it was just like, where did this come from?

30:14.040 --> 30:16.280
I was lurking in Intoxicated's channel one night.

30:16.280 --> 30:17.560
It was like midnight or something.

30:17.560 --> 30:21.080
I was playing a game on my first monitor and I was channel surfing on Twitch, as I often do.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.520
And I heard you and saw you in the chat and I just cracked up.

30:24.520 --> 30:28.760
I was gonna say hi, but I was like, sometimes it's more fun to just lurk.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.140
Yeah.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.920
Were you there to see the four megs?

30:35.800 --> 30:37.480
No, that doesn't sound familiar.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.640
I will send you a picture of the four megs.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.400
He was getting tunneled out.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.280
And he was really puffy about that.

30:45.080 --> 30:46.200
Things have been stinky.

30:46.920 --> 30:51.240
Yeah, the game needs a kick in the butt.

30:51.240 --> 30:51.640
I don't know.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.680
I don't know what else to say about it.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.240
It just needs a kick in the butt beyond just continued DLC.

30:55.240 --> 30:58.360
They need to stop rewarding people for having no skill.

31:00.200 --> 31:06.840
At any rate, I also do want to remind other players that if you log into your account every day,

31:07.720 --> 31:12.200
then they're doing the December advent calendar for Dead by Daylight where you can get

31:12.760 --> 31:16.520
uh, usually 25,000 blood points.

31:16.520 --> 31:21.480
There will be like a big bunch of stuff for Christmas and Christmas Eve and a couple of

31:21.480 --> 31:25.560
weekends where you get 50,000 where you get rift shards and iridescent shards.

31:26.120 --> 31:29.720
So, um, definitely good thing to do.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.200
Even if you're not planning on playing that day, just log into your game.

31:33.160 --> 31:39.800
Um, I have a game that I super, super want, but I don't have the hundred bucks to

31:39.800 --> 31:40.760
dump on it right now.

31:41.640 --> 31:47.240
And I really want Marvel Midnight Suns because I want the, the legendary so I can get all

31:47.240 --> 31:50.200
the outfits and the DLC do the whole game.

31:51.240 --> 31:57.480
Um, but I'm taking donations of steam wallet gift certificates.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.200
Everybody.

31:58.200 --> 31:58.760
I'm kidding.

31:59.400 --> 32:05.960
Um, I have also, of course, I did my stupid word scapes game, which, uh, kind of getting

32:05.960 --> 32:06.600
annoyed with it.

32:07.160 --> 32:10.760
Um, I played a little cult of the lamb.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.000
I've played Final Fantasy five.

32:13.000 --> 32:21.480
We just got the submarine last night and, um, I played something else and I can't remember

32:21.480 --> 32:23.160
for the life of me what it was.

32:25.640 --> 32:31.320
Oh, well, as I say, I watched you play in Final Fantasy five as well, but it must be

32:31.320 --> 32:33.480
something you didn't stream because I didn't, you know,

32:34.040 --> 32:36.280
well, I, I play stuff that I do on stream.

32:36.280 --> 32:40.120
It's just like, um, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.840
Uh, I started to play a little bit of hooked on you again.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.640
They just had an update for it, but I didn't.

32:46.520 --> 32:49.400
I like kind of logged into it and then I was like, oh, I got stuff to do.

32:49.400 --> 32:55.720
So I've been playing around a lot in like DAZ 3d trying to make different, you know,

32:56.280 --> 33:00.520
3d models and stuff and thinking about making my Vtuber in it.

33:01.080 --> 33:01.560
Oh, okay.

33:02.040 --> 33:02.520
Oh, cool.

33:02.520 --> 33:03.020
Yeah.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.960
So we did get the Genesis mini too.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.160
I'm just going to add that in.

33:07.160 --> 33:09.240
Oh, there was some play on that.

33:09.800 --> 33:10.520
Nice.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.280
Any games that stuck out for you?

33:13.880 --> 33:15.160
We played Space Harrier.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.200
There's a lot of good stuff on there.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.040
You know, it's just good old Genesis games.

33:20.040 --> 33:23.320
We raided somebody last week cause you, you weren't here after the show.

33:23.320 --> 33:27.080
So we did a couple of raids on some, some randos and one week, one week I did an old

33:27.080 --> 33:28.200
DDR freak pal.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.560
One of the weeks you weren't here.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.640
I let Bobby pick last week and he, he picked somebody he knows through games done quick

33:33.640 --> 33:35.160
and I'm sure he'll shout out who it was in chat.

33:35.160 --> 33:40.200
But the reason why I bring it up is that the raid message was a welcome to the fantasy

33:40.200 --> 33:42.040
zone, get ready with the whole space Harrier thing.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.120
And I was like, oh, I wish dark soccer has seen that.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.000
Cause that's like legit like her thing.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.880
So my, well, my channel is technically nicknamed the fantasy zone.

33:51.880 --> 33:52.280
Yeah.

33:52.280 --> 33:52.780
Yeah.

33:53.080 --> 33:56.280
So cartridge blowers was the name of the streamer says Bobby.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.720
So I like it.

33:57.720 --> 33:58.200
I like it.

33:58.200 --> 34:05.480
We'll have to, uh, and I've, I've, you know, I've been talking with people about doing

34:05.480 --> 34:08.760
some Twitch related things in the public.

34:08.760 --> 34:11.080
So keep your eyes open maybe.

34:11.080 --> 34:11.580
Okay.

34:12.520 --> 34:12.840
All right.

34:12.840 --> 34:13.960
No, I'm keeping them shut.

34:13.960 --> 34:14.460
Okay.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.760
Then I'm going to eat my spaghetti.

34:17.640 --> 34:17.960
All right.

34:17.960 --> 34:18.920
Moving on.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.200
Let's go to Loki.

34:20.200 --> 34:21.080
How was your gaming week?

34:21.720 --> 34:23.720
It was all Minecraft as usual.

34:23.720 --> 34:26.360
I've been just trying to like grind out stuff.

34:26.360 --> 34:30.360
It's been a month since I put out a video on the channel, 64 SMPs.

34:30.360 --> 34:35.480
This is because I had a really complicated build in redstone stuff and it's done.

34:36.280 --> 34:38.680
Um, just editing the video now.

34:39.960 --> 34:40.280
Awesome.

34:40.280 --> 34:48.440
So the film stuff, but yeah, it, it was, um, it came out good, but it was a journey to

34:48.440 --> 34:49.000
get it done.

34:50.760 --> 34:51.260
All right.

34:51.720 --> 34:55.000
Well, if that's it, uh, I'll go to my gaming week.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.520
Um, a lot of the same stuff, a little bit of dead by daylight, but not a lot.

34:58.520 --> 35:04.040
Um, I also played, um, Uh, a little more vampire survivors.

35:04.040 --> 35:05.960
Cause I've been talking about that on previous shows.

35:05.960 --> 35:09.320
I've been into that, um, Pokemon crack.

35:09.320 --> 35:09.720
It is.

35:09.720 --> 35:13.320
And I want to get that other one that, um, Nick was playing the soul survivors or whatever

35:13.320 --> 35:13.800
it's called.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.960
I want to get that one also pretty.

35:15.960 --> 35:20.120
So I'll probably grab that at some point, but when I stream, I really try to limit myself

35:20.120 --> 35:21.320
to Pokemon scarlet.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.760
I'm way behind everyone else.

35:22.760 --> 35:26.360
Cause I just, I with, I've had some other stuff going on personally this week.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.880
So I just have not really been able to get around to streaming and I've been seeing my

35:29.880 --> 35:31.560
Pokemon scarlet gameplay for stream.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.400
I know people have run circles around that game.

35:33.400 --> 35:33.720
Now.

35:33.720 --> 35:38.520
Shane has beat both violet and scarlet at this point is in how many times he completed

35:38.520 --> 35:40.040
his decks completely.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.800
So I know like, yeah.

35:41.800 --> 35:47.000
So, and I'm, I'm sitting here going, I have seven badges, but now keep in mind, it's not

35:47.000 --> 35:48.120
just eight gym badges.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.720
It's eight gym badges.

35:49.720 --> 35:55.000
I think five Titan badges and maybe five star badges, question mark.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.840
Somebody will might correct me on that if I'm wrong, but I have seven.

35:58.840 --> 36:00.280
So I have two, two and three.

36:00.280 --> 36:02.440
I have three gyms and two of the, two of the other ones.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.440
So I'm a little behind, but that's okay.

36:04.440 --> 36:04.920
You know what?

36:04.920 --> 36:06.120
I do things at my own pace.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.040
It took me a year to beat sword and shield.

36:08.040 --> 36:08.920
So I'm fine.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.600
I'm, I'm, I'm moving on with it.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.080
It's it's fine.

36:12.920 --> 36:17.720
So I've been playing that the other game I've been playing is really surprised me.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.080
I didn't even know if I wanted to talk about it tonight, but I'm going to, cause I know

36:21.080 --> 36:24.840
I'm going to get made fun of for this, but I I'm like, whatever, you know what?

36:24.840 --> 36:27.880
I'm all about honesty and transparency here on orange knowledge radio.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.320
I haven't been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14 lately.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.960
There's a little bit of a content lull in the game.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.360
The free company that I was in is basically falling apart.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.640
Well, I shouldn't say that.

36:39.640 --> 36:43.240
I don't really know the people in my free company and like, but, but all of the friends

36:43.240 --> 36:45.480
that I play with, none of them are playing anymore.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.760
So I like don't have anything to do right now.

36:48.760 --> 36:55.800
I I've not fallen out of love with a Final Fantasy 14 by any means, but I'm just in a

36:55.800 --> 36:57.560
lull and I'm just kind of like, you know what?

36:58.600 --> 37:01.000
Yoshi P and Final Fantasy 14.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.600
I think it's not you, it's me.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.480
We just need to see, see other people for a little while.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.720
We just need to, we just, and you know what?

37:08.600 --> 37:13.880
One of my, one of my old F buddies just put out a new expansion this week.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.480
And so I reactivated my wow account.

37:18.920 --> 37:23.480
I'm, I'm not touching any of those games until what the fuck is gone.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.800
I, I, I understand those concerns.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.760
And I'm not happy about it either.

37:29.320 --> 37:33.320
I feel like after the behavior of another person who has association with the company,

37:33.320 --> 37:34.520
I'm kind of disgusted.

37:34.520 --> 37:41.480
I, I have to walk a fine line here because I have several friends that work at said company

37:41.480 --> 37:44.760
and I want to respect their work, but still hate their CEO.

37:45.480 --> 37:49.880
As I've said a few weeks ago on this show, when I was talking about Overwatch 2 and,

37:49.880 --> 37:55.160
you know, Diablo and some of that, here's the thing is that, well, number one, you know,

37:55.160 --> 37:58.600
we all know the standby, there's no ethical consumption or capitalism, blah, blah, blah,

37:58.600 --> 37:59.000
that whole thing.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.440
You have to pick your battles, blah, blah, blah.

38:01.240 --> 38:07.400
All of these problems that started with Activision Blizzard are very clearly industry-wide

38:07.400 --> 38:07.880
problems.

38:09.000 --> 38:16.840
So I would have to quit gaming to really, you know, suitably address all of the issues

38:16.840 --> 38:17.240
that are going on.

38:17.240 --> 38:18.440
I have to quit Nintendo games.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.760
We've talked about that in a previous episode.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.600
I'd have to quit Ubisoft games.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.800
I'd have to go, you know, you name it, there's problems everywhere.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.720
All of these problems are at every studio.

38:27.720 --> 38:33.160
So I feel like we have to walk a line and I want to encourage my friends that are, you

38:33.160 --> 38:36.440
know, working hard on these types of things and really incur well.

38:36.440 --> 38:40.920
And also through that, I've also heard, and I don't know what I can and can't say, so

38:40.920 --> 38:44.120
I'm always going to err on the side of can't say, because people tell me these things in

38:44.120 --> 38:49.160
confidence, that there are real tangible changes that are going on in the culture.

38:49.160 --> 38:53.400
And I've been told specifically some of the changes that happened versus the way it used

38:53.400 --> 38:53.900
to be.

38:54.600 --> 38:58.280
So there is change happening, even if it isn't always visible.

38:59.160 --> 39:01.320
Like I said, part of my reason is also spite.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.080
I understand.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.040
That's your reason.

39:04.040 --> 39:04.840
This is my reason.

39:05.400 --> 39:11.960
So I just, you know, I was kind of curious, like actually what it was.

39:11.960 --> 39:15.480
And it wasn't just the whole new expansion, actually.

39:15.480 --> 39:21.160
I was super curious about WoW Classic, which just bumped up to Wrath of the Lich King.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.480
And I was like, it really was.

39:23.480 --> 39:28.920
I want to go shack up with my ex and I want to go play Wrath of the Lich King for a little

39:28.920 --> 39:29.480
bit.

39:29.480 --> 39:34.520
And so I was like, all right, whatever, I'm going to pay the money, the 15 bucks to try

39:34.520 --> 39:36.360
this month and go play Classic Wrath.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.200
And I was actually having a really good time with it.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.640
Yes, it's a grind.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.960
Yes, you know, but it really was.

39:41.960 --> 39:45.880
It felt like playing an old PlayStation 2 RPG.

39:45.880 --> 39:51.320
You know, like I'm going back to visit this old friend and, you know, I'm having a good

39:51.320 --> 39:51.820
time with it.

39:52.440 --> 39:57.720
Where the game started to lose me a little bit is when I got up to the content where

39:57.720 --> 40:05.240
I could run dungeons, there's hardly anybody online and there's no dungeon finders.

40:05.800 --> 40:09.720
So you can't find people like nobody's doing the baby dungeons.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.600
If anybody's online doing dungeons, they're all doing the end game stuff.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.720
And since there's no dungeon finder, they're all doing shouts and all that stuff.

40:15.720 --> 40:19.800
So that's when I started to be like, all right, I'm kind of running out of stuff to do.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.120
So that's why I went, you know what?

40:22.120 --> 40:22.440
Fuck it.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.520
Let me go see what's going on in retail.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.480
By the way, you'll notice I never said I bought the expansion.

40:27.720 --> 40:28.220
I haven't.

40:28.920 --> 40:33.880
I just said, all right, since I re-upped this sub so I could play classic anyway, let me

40:33.880 --> 40:36.520
see what the hell's going on in retail.

40:36.520 --> 40:37.020
Wow.

40:37.880 --> 40:43.080
And I got to say, because I haven't touched it in quite a long time, I was very like,

40:43.720 --> 40:50.440
holy shit, this game has changed because I guess with this most recent expansion, they

40:50.440 --> 40:52.120
actually completely redid the UI.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.760
And you want to know what the gag is about the UI?

40:54.760 --> 40:58.920
It is extremely Final Fantasy XIV's UI.

41:01.480 --> 41:04.440
Now, but this is what's fascinating about it.

41:04.440 --> 41:05.720
That's actually not a dig on WoW.

41:06.360 --> 41:11.640
This is actually where I wanted WoW to be like five years ago when WoW was very boring

41:11.640 --> 41:13.560
to me, was that I was like, you know what?

41:13.560 --> 41:18.840
Warcraft maybe needs to get knocked off of its pedestal a little bit to really see what

41:18.840 --> 41:23.000
else is going on out there and maybe take influence from some of the other kids out

41:23.000 --> 41:23.560
on the market.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.800
And it took a little while, but boy, oh boy, does it seem like that's exactly what's

41:27.800 --> 41:28.600
happened.

41:28.600 --> 41:36.120
And I'm noticing an extreme amount of increase in the amount of cut scenes, voice acting

41:36.120 --> 41:40.120
and the other types of music and the other types of things that Final Fantasy XIV is

41:40.120 --> 41:40.840
known for.

41:40.840 --> 41:41.560
But you know what?

41:41.560 --> 41:47.160
This isn't just a, haha, WoW is more like Final Fantasy XIV because guess what?

41:47.160 --> 41:50.120
This is a silical thing in the industry.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.520
This goes round and round because you know what?

41:52.520 --> 41:59.800
Final Fantasy XIV 1.0, remember, sucked ass bad.

42:02.360 --> 42:07.400
And when they redid 2.0 in Realm Reborn, do you remember what Yoshi P cited as one of

42:07.400 --> 42:10.280
the big influences for Final Fantasy XIV in Realm Reborn?

42:11.160 --> 42:12.040
World of Warcraft.

42:13.480 --> 42:19.160
So now we're at a point with these MMOs where it's clear that it's not just one influencing

42:19.160 --> 42:21.720
the other, they're influencing each other.

42:22.680 --> 42:25.800
That is the coolest part of, I think, what I've experienced so far.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.840
I'm like, it blows my mind.

42:28.840 --> 42:34.440
The UI has a UI edit mode and it is like, it is exactly Final Fantasy XIV's UI edit

42:34.440 --> 42:34.840
mode.

42:34.840 --> 42:35.640
Exactly.

42:35.640 --> 42:39.560
Like it's not, it's different components because it's WoW versus XIV, but like the

42:39.560 --> 42:45.160
UI edit thing is exactly like move this frame here, resize it, move this, the little things

42:45.160 --> 42:46.120
in the corner.

42:46.120 --> 42:47.800
It's all, it's all XIV's UI.

42:49.320 --> 42:49.640
Good.

42:52.040 --> 42:56.680
But like how many people replace all that shit anyway using deadly boss mods?

42:56.680 --> 42:57.480
So true.

42:57.480 --> 42:58.440
So true.

42:58.440 --> 43:02.520
Because I was watching Twitch streamers play it because that was also a big part of my,

43:02.520 --> 43:04.840
I wonder, I wonder what my ex is up to.

43:05.720 --> 43:10.040
Twitch was a huge enabler in that department and wondering what my ex is up to and watch

43:10.040 --> 43:10.520
what's going on.

43:10.520 --> 43:14.760
And I, I see all these different streams like I can't fucking tell shit for shit from

43:14.760 --> 43:16.600
all these mods that people are running.

43:16.600 --> 43:20.440
And I had, I didn't, like, I was watching people play the newest expansion.

43:20.440 --> 43:23.880
I was like, I, I don't know what the hell's going on here outside of the cut scenes and

43:23.880 --> 43:27.480
some of these other things because I cannot understand their UI.

43:27.480 --> 43:32.920
But when I saw the default UI for the first time, when I booted up WoW retail, I was like,

43:33.560 --> 43:36.440
I legit texted Shane right away.

43:36.440 --> 43:42.040
And I was like, you didn't tell me that, wow, like didn't just like get some influence

43:42.040 --> 43:45.960
from Final Fantasy XIV, but like got like a lot of influence from Final Fantasy XIV.

43:47.080 --> 43:51.400
See, I was actually about to re-up my XIV account.

43:54.040 --> 43:58.040
And like I said, everything I've just talked about has nothing to do with like, I dislike

43:58.040 --> 43:58.920
XIV or anything.

43:58.920 --> 44:00.360
I'll be back there when the new patch is out.

44:00.360 --> 44:05.320
There's just a content lol for me, but I've, I've played, I literally have maxed out everything

44:05.320 --> 44:07.160
you can do on Island Sanctuary.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.680
I don't end game raid.

44:08.680 --> 44:12.360
There's nothing left for me right now, but there will be in subsequent patches.

44:12.360 --> 44:12.760
Cool.

44:12.760 --> 44:13.880
I'll look forward to that.

44:13.880 --> 44:18.360
I'm actually glad for a change because usually Final Fantasy XIV and WoW kind of release

44:18.360 --> 44:19.720
content on the same day.

44:19.720 --> 44:22.600
I don't know if it's intentional or not, but like they didn't do that this time.

44:22.600 --> 44:25.000
And I think that's really good actually.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.200
So yeah.

44:26.840 --> 44:27.720
So anyway, yeah.

44:27.720 --> 44:31.960
Miramews in chat says, we'll be here for your hangover and walk of shame in a few weeks.

44:31.960 --> 44:32.520
Thank you.

44:32.520 --> 44:33.400
Appreciate that.

44:33.960 --> 44:37.080
Mike Defton chat says, competition brings innovation.

44:37.080 --> 44:37.580
Yep.

44:38.360 --> 44:41.400
SSJ100Matt says, so Horde House coming back when?

44:41.640 --> 44:47.400
Um, actually grandpa's been asking when he can come on Orange Lounge Radio.

44:47.400 --> 44:50.840
And I said, as soon as he can clean up his mouth, cause the jokes he used to make back

44:50.840 --> 44:52.360
then aren't going to fly today.

44:52.360 --> 44:57.400
So that's one, but at some point, but then Shane's like, oh, we need to stream or something.

44:57.400 --> 45:01.160
So really all I need to do is call X Defer and we probably could get a reunion.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.000
So just, you know, wait for it.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.760
Um, SSJ100Matt also says, hey boo, you up?

45:06.760 --> 45:07.960
Rob's text to wow.

45:11.960 --> 45:15.400
Questbuster says, no shame taking a break to play something else.

45:15.400 --> 45:16.120
Uh, yeah.

45:16.120 --> 45:17.480
Dark Tetsuya's huh?

45:18.200 --> 45:19.640
Just what went in through my head.

45:19.640 --> 45:20.680
No booty calls.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.600
That's not happening.

45:26.680 --> 45:29.720
Dark Tetsuya said Rob's breaking up with Final Fantasy 14.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.480
No, we're not breaking up.

45:31.480 --> 45:33.560
We're just opening the relationship for a little bit.

45:33.560 --> 45:33.960
That's all.

45:34.040 --> 45:36.360
All right.

45:37.880 --> 45:38.200
All right.

45:38.200 --> 45:39.480
So that was my gaming week.

45:39.480 --> 45:40.280
There you go.

45:40.280 --> 45:43.240
Now you all know why I didn't want to talk about it, but I'm going to, I'm going to be

45:43.240 --> 45:44.600
honest here on orange launch radio.

45:44.600 --> 45:45.160
That's what I do.

45:46.040 --> 45:46.360
All right.

45:47.640 --> 45:51.880
Uh, if you want to, if you want to send your comments and gaming weeks and all that good

45:51.880 --> 45:56.120
stuff, send us an email, participate at orange launch radio.com is a great place to do that.

45:56.120 --> 45:56.920
All right.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.520
Let's get into some news.

45:58.520 --> 45:59.880
I would get into housekeeping.

45:59.880 --> 46:01.320
I don't really have anything tonight.

46:01.960 --> 46:05.640
Bobby Black Wolf is going to be off for the next couple of weeks, just for personal vacation

46:05.640 --> 46:06.040
reasons.

46:06.600 --> 46:11.000
So we'll be starting, you know, right at nine Eastern, six Pacific VOG.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.280
But as far as our show goes, we don't, you know, it's the holidays.

46:14.280 --> 46:18.520
So the news will be a little less just, but, you know, probably not next week.

46:18.520 --> 46:20.040
The game awards are happening this week.

46:20.040 --> 46:23.320
So I expect we're gonna have a lot of game announcements to dig into next week.

46:23.880 --> 46:27.240
We're not going to be able to do a co-stream of the game awards though, because I have

46:27.240 --> 46:27.960
other commitments.

46:28.680 --> 46:32.680
Bobby is working with the aforementioned vacation.

46:34.360 --> 46:37.640
So I just think it's not going to happen this year, but I do hope you all enjoy the game

46:37.640 --> 46:38.140
awards.

46:38.760 --> 46:39.720
I think it'll be interesting.

46:39.720 --> 46:41.880
We'll talk more about the game awards a little later on in the show.

46:43.160 --> 46:46.920
I'm still trying to figure out if we're going to be here on December 25th, which I'm sure

46:46.920 --> 46:48.280
you all know is Christmas day.

46:49.000 --> 46:54.520
I just need to make sure nothing's going on in my family, meaning really Alan's family

46:54.520 --> 46:56.840
is the one we usually do December 25th with.

46:56.840 --> 47:00.200
As soon as I know that, I'll be able to know if I'm going to be here or not.

47:01.080 --> 47:06.280
But Dark Soccer and I have been talking about going out for Chinese food, which used to

47:06.280 --> 47:08.040
be a tradition of sorts.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.160
Then the pandemic happened.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.400
So this would be the first time in a while.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.360
So it'll be good.

47:14.360 --> 47:14.840
All right.

47:14.840 --> 47:15.800
We'll see what happens.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.000
We'll see what happens.

47:17.000 --> 47:17.560
All right.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.560
Let's get into some more gaming news.

47:19.560 --> 47:23.560
Because, you know, even though we are in the holidays, this period between Thanksgiving

47:23.560 --> 47:28.040
and, you know, all the December holidays, there's still some gaming news going on.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.720
And of course, the game awards happening this week.

47:29.720 --> 47:33.960
But first off, Loki in the not so great news column.

47:34.680 --> 47:36.520
Yeah, let's talk about harmonics.

47:36.520 --> 47:41.400
So, you know, we're talking about a game shutting down because that's whatever it is that we

47:41.400 --> 47:42.680
talk about harmonics nowadays.

47:43.480 --> 47:47.960
Fuser, they're kind of a DJ mixing sim.

47:48.760 --> 47:54.760
The online services for that will be shutting down December 19th.

47:54.760 --> 47:56.600
So a couple of weeks.

47:57.160 --> 48:04.440
And basically, you know, the DLC and stuff will still be available until then.

48:04.440 --> 48:07.720
But you'll only be able to play through the campaign in quick play.

48:09.240 --> 48:11.080
You won't be able to play online, obviously.

48:11.080 --> 48:17.160
So that's unfortunate, considering that they're bought by Epic.

48:17.160 --> 48:20.920
And I think they have the money to, you know, keep those servers up.

48:21.800 --> 48:22.300
Yeah.

48:23.400 --> 48:27.560
You know, it's well, they are doing their Fortnite now.

48:27.560 --> 48:29.160
Harmonics is a Fortnite company.

48:29.160 --> 48:34.840
They've said as much, but the most, you know, it's Alan plays a lot of Fortnite now.

48:34.840 --> 48:37.160
That's like the game he's been playing a lot of lately.

48:37.160 --> 48:39.720
So, you know, I've been picking up on a lot of Fortnite.

48:40.040 --> 48:41.960
You know, I've been picking up on what's going on.

48:41.960 --> 48:45.320
The no build mode really changed Fortnite for the better for a lot of people.

48:45.960 --> 48:47.000
And Alan's one of them.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.200
And even for me, I'm like, oh, yeah, if they took the building crap out of Fortnite, I'd

48:50.200 --> 48:51.000
be interested in it.

48:51.560 --> 48:54.040
So he's going to teach me how to play at some point on a stream.

48:54.040 --> 48:55.320
So we'll do that.

48:56.200 --> 49:01.880
But I always thought Fortnite was most fascinating when it did like the concerts and the movie

49:01.880 --> 49:05.320
premieres and the trailer premieres, whatever, and the pop culture stuff.

49:05.320 --> 49:08.840
And we're talking about this a little bit on Bobby show on before us tonight.

49:08.840 --> 49:12.600
I think it's important to state when we talk about the Ariana Grande concert, which I'm

49:12.600 --> 49:18.120
sure harmonics or what's left of it had something to do with as it's been absorbed into epic.

49:18.760 --> 49:21.480
The Ariana Grande concert wasn't really a concert.

49:21.480 --> 49:22.680
We keep calling it that.

49:22.680 --> 49:27.000
But it wasn't like you were just standing there watching a fake avatar on the stage,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.080
fake lip syncing to fake songs and stuff.

49:29.080 --> 49:29.880
It wasn't what it was.

49:30.520 --> 49:34.200
It was an interactive music video, keyword interactive.

49:34.200 --> 49:35.320
You were the interaction.

49:35.880 --> 49:38.600
And that's what made that kind of neat.

49:38.920 --> 49:42.120
I'll let you go download Bobby show if you want to hear a much longer discussion, because

49:42.120 --> 49:48.280
we talked about how honestly when it comes to like meta, the companies or Facebook, if

49:48.280 --> 49:52.040
you will, metaverse, it's a joke.

49:52.040 --> 49:57.320
It's literally a joke because it's just trying to bring us something we've seen before.

49:57.320 --> 49:59.640
Whereas say what you will about epic.

49:59.640 --> 50:04.120
I'm not always a fan of how Tim Sweeney can touch himself online and some of his tweets

50:04.120 --> 50:07.960
and some of the fights he gets into, even if I will always be a fan of ZZT.

50:07.960 --> 50:10.120
And I do like some of the things that Fortnite is doing.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.000
Bring back ZZT.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.640
Come on, Fortnite season four or five.

50:13.640 --> 50:18.120
Isn't it wild to think that that guy made ZZT?

50:18.120 --> 50:22.920
But then you look at Fortnite and what it's doing.

50:22.920 --> 50:28.200
And quite honestly, Loki, you see seeds of that in ZZT.

50:28.200 --> 50:32.120
If you want to go way back, somebody had to have done a YouTube analysis.

50:32.920 --> 50:35.320
Is there some of you YouTube fans?

50:36.760 --> 50:41.480
Is there like a three hour YouTube analysis on how ZZT influenced Fortnite?

50:41.480 --> 50:43.800
Because if there's not, there really should be the same.

50:44.840 --> 50:48.360
I'm just saying like, I know that they tried to push that whole like, I don't remember

50:48.360 --> 50:49.320
what it was called now.

50:49.320 --> 50:54.680
It was a platform that was basically unreal, but it was like, oh, I thought you were going

50:54.680 --> 50:56.360
to say ZZT oop.

50:56.360 --> 51:00.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but there's that too.

51:00.120 --> 51:06.920
But like what I'm saying is if they just took ZZT and like, you know, made it kind of polygonal

51:06.920 --> 51:11.480
and stuff, but still kind of ZZT where you're building it with blocks.

51:11.480 --> 51:16.520
The super ZZT we were always promised and technically got, but lightning didn't hit

51:16.520 --> 51:16.920
twice.

51:16.920 --> 51:19.080
Yeah, no, I'm talking about something more modern than that.

51:19.080 --> 51:21.000
Not like sticking to ASCII characters.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.920
I'm talking about like, you know, still building with blocks and everything, but, you know,

51:24.920 --> 51:30.120
and doing maybe even like it'd be the 2D or 2D, you know, over the top types of gameplay

51:30.120 --> 51:35.080
still, but like being able to build stuff out of that would be pretty awesome.

51:35.080 --> 51:37.800
Well, and here, you know what's funny?

51:37.800 --> 51:41.640
There's actually, it's funny you bring that up and then I see in chat, I can't see actually

51:41.640 --> 51:43.960
says I just like epic free games.

51:43.960 --> 51:47.800
Ironic that you bring that up because one of the epic free games in the store right

51:47.800 --> 51:50.120
now is an RPG making game.

51:50.120 --> 51:52.200
It's not RPG maker, but a different one.

51:52.920 --> 51:56.360
Somebody will probably yell it out in a chat before I get my epic game store up over here,

51:56.360 --> 51:59.320
but it's actually a make your RPG game.

51:59.320 --> 52:03.240
It's almost exactly what you're describing, Loki, except it's specifically for RPGs.

52:03.240 --> 52:06.920
But otherwise, like it's create your own 3D voxel art type of thing.

52:06.920 --> 52:12.520
And like it's literally the free game on the epic store right now until like the 15th.

52:12.520 --> 52:15.880
So it's funny you bring that up because I'm like, actually, that's kind of what's in the

52:15.880 --> 52:16.760
epic store right now.

52:16.760 --> 52:17.720
RPG in a box.

52:17.720 --> 52:18.520
Thank you.

52:18.520 --> 52:21.320
I can't see that is what's called RPG in a box.

52:21.320 --> 52:22.680
So all right.

52:24.600 --> 52:28.200
Jason in chat says I haven't watched any videos, but I found a video with the title.

52:28.200 --> 52:33.000
Why epic games took 25 years to make Fortnite that could have relevance to your idea.

52:33.000 --> 52:33.500
Yes.

52:35.160 --> 52:36.600
Get get the table meme.

52:36.600 --> 52:37.480
Get the table meme.

52:37.480 --> 52:38.040
Here it is.

52:38.040 --> 52:43.560
I'm sitting at the table and my banner at the table says Fortnite is just super ZZT.

52:43.560 --> 52:44.280
Change my mind.

52:46.920 --> 52:51.160
Anyway, if you don't know what I know, we keep referencing ZZT and there's

52:51.160 --> 52:53.960
probably many of you out there that are like, what the fuck are they talking about?

52:53.960 --> 53:00.680
It was an old, old 90s DOS game that you could that was the most powerful thing about it

53:00.680 --> 53:06.920
was creating your own games and what ultimately became other experiences and other like people

53:06.920 --> 53:12.280
would basically create journals of their life and things like that inside this ZZT game.

53:12.280 --> 53:13.320
And it was a game.

53:13.320 --> 53:17.960
It was big when I was in high school, probably like 95, 94, 95 when this game was out.

53:17.960 --> 53:20.200
And Tim Sweeney made it.

53:20.200 --> 53:23.640
And he's now the CEO of Epic Games.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.880
So basically his company is what brought Fortnite.

53:25.880 --> 53:31.080
Now, again, I don't really like a lot of how Tim Sweeney conducts himself online, but I

53:31.080 --> 53:36.440
will always be a fan of ZZT and that stuff, you know, that's and it was hugely influential

53:36.440 --> 53:40.520
to my career as a gamer and the way I grew up in gaming.

53:40.520 --> 53:46.120
And Orangewright also says in episode 561 of OLR, we picked it as a classic game.

53:46.760 --> 53:50.280
So I think I did.

53:50.280 --> 53:50.760
Did you?

53:50.760 --> 53:52.520
Because I was to say that I don't think I did.

53:52.520 --> 53:54.200
No, no, no, you would.

53:54.200 --> 53:57.400
It was definitely a week you were out and like probably Loki and I were like, what do

53:57.400 --> 53:59.480
we both like ZZT?

53:59.480 --> 53:59.800
All right.

53:59.800 --> 54:02.040
Anyway, let's see.

54:02.760 --> 54:03.960
Other comments in chat.

54:03.960 --> 54:09.240
So S2100 Matt says, I hope harmonics is still there when the music game market blows up

54:09.240 --> 54:09.800
again.

54:09.800 --> 54:13.720
My worry is if harmonics gets fully dissolved, like so many of these companies have been

54:13.720 --> 54:16.840
doing with consolidations recently and incorporated in Epic.

54:17.400 --> 54:18.360
Hopefully, hopefully.

54:19.480 --> 54:22.680
Also, I want to point out back to what the story was really about before we got on the

54:22.680 --> 54:25.560
Fortnite thing is about Fuser being sunset.

54:26.120 --> 54:26.680
Shad Leland.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.160
Hi, Shane.

54:27.160 --> 54:31.320
In chat says, man, RIP drop mix again, basically.

54:31.320 --> 54:34.040
Yeah, but I mean, I'm looking at it going.

54:34.040 --> 54:37.160
I didn't really help because I never bought Fuser.

54:37.160 --> 54:38.840
I only played it that one weekend.

54:38.840 --> 54:43.240
It was free on Xbox, but I was always waiting for that $20 sale that never came.

54:43.240 --> 54:48.200
And to be fair, with all the music licensing in the game, it probably was never able to

54:48.200 --> 54:48.760
happen.

54:48.760 --> 54:54.440
The game was probably too expensive to fund everything in it for that to ever really happen,

54:54.440 --> 54:55.800
to be quite honest.

54:55.800 --> 54:57.640
So there's that.

54:57.640 --> 55:00.760
DJ Rama S asked, did I read Cliffy B's book yet?

55:00.760 --> 55:03.480
No, it's sitting on my bookshelf, thanks to a very kind donor.

55:04.120 --> 55:07.880
But no, there's a million things to do.

55:07.880 --> 55:09.560
So little time to do them, right?

55:09.640 --> 55:16.840
Maybe when I go on vacation to a nice desert island that has no Internet coverage, that'll

55:16.840 --> 55:18.200
be a book I bring with me for sure.

55:18.200 --> 55:19.560
That and my John Waters book.

55:19.560 --> 55:20.280
I want to read them both.

55:21.960 --> 55:29.080
And I keep wanting to say Jonathan Taylor Thomas, but that's not his name.

55:29.080 --> 55:30.040
Jonathan Van Ness.

55:31.320 --> 55:32.440
Very different people.

55:32.440 --> 55:33.800
My Jonathan Van Ness book.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.680
Although, have you ever seen the two of them at the same time?

55:36.680 --> 55:37.880
I don't think you have.

55:37.880 --> 55:38.380
All right.

55:39.080 --> 55:44.680
Anyway, also with Fuser, here's the thing.

55:45.720 --> 55:50.200
I think it was a great sandbox and you could do really cool things with it.

55:50.200 --> 55:52.440
I don't think the game just didn't make sense.

55:53.480 --> 55:54.760
It wasn't much of a game.

55:54.760 --> 55:57.080
And I understand there was a game there.

55:57.080 --> 56:01.240
I understand some people played it and had fun with it, but I think they just built rules

56:01.240 --> 56:02.840
around sandboxing.

56:02.840 --> 56:07.400
And so it was just hard to convince people to pay $60 for a really cool sandbox.

56:07.400 --> 56:10.520
And let's be real, drop mix was a lot of the same thing.

56:10.520 --> 56:12.200
Yes, it was a fun game.

56:12.200 --> 56:17.800
If you could get people to actually play it and not just playing with the box until they

56:17.800 --> 56:18.440
were done with it.

56:19.080 --> 56:27.080
So I just think it was a cool idea, but it wasn't able to really be fully realized as

56:27.080 --> 56:27.560
a game.

56:27.560 --> 56:31.320
Most of the time, people would wear it out as a sandbox, to be honest.

56:31.960 --> 56:35.240
So rest in peace, Fuser.

56:35.240 --> 56:40.680
But also when you consider that music licenses are only good for so many years, I mean, it

56:40.680 --> 56:43.800
isn't terribly surprising, but it's sad.

56:44.760 --> 56:47.320
Yeah, but it's not really that the game's not.

56:47.320 --> 56:49.480
I mean, it's just the online services, though.

56:49.480 --> 56:51.800
They're not going to sell the game anymore either, from what I understand.

56:51.800 --> 56:56.120
I mean, they can't stop you from walking into a GameStop and buying one used, but it's just

56:56.120 --> 56:57.960
going to drive up the price of the game, that's for sure.

56:59.320 --> 56:59.820
Yeah.

57:00.780 --> 57:07.500
All right, let's move on and talk about a new feature that's coming to the PlayStation

57:07.500 --> 57:10.620
5, and that is PlayStation tournaments.

57:10.620 --> 57:15.580
So PlayStation tournaments have just been launched by Sony Interactive Entertainment,

57:15.580 --> 57:19.820
and that was announced this week in one of the PlayStation blog posts.

57:19.820 --> 57:22.140
This was already on PlayStation 4.

57:22.140 --> 57:25.340
It's just one of those things that they're catching up with now on the PlayStation 5.

57:25.340 --> 57:30.380
It was in beta testing for three months, and now it's going to launch with some other

57:30.380 --> 57:36.620
changes, including shorter tournament times, seamless console signup, easily discoverable

57:36.620 --> 57:41.260
tournaments, a redone interface, real-time match updates, and more.

57:41.820 --> 57:46.700
So some of the first official PlayStation tournaments that will be available on the

57:46.700 --> 57:55.420
PlayStation 5 will include Guilty Gear Strive, NBA 2K23, and FIFA 23, just in time for the

57:55.420 --> 57:55.920
World Cup.

57:56.620 --> 58:01.260
You can play and compete to win prizes among these special events, challenges, leaderboard

58:01.260 --> 58:03.500
competitions, and so forth with the community.

58:03.500 --> 58:08.060
I wonder if Stars are a part of that, because PlayStation Stars finally launched, because

58:08.060 --> 58:11.100
I don't fire up my PlayStation all the time, but I did, and I was like, oh, yeah, I got

58:11.100 --> 58:14.140
to sign up for this PlayStation Stars thing that's telling me about.

58:14.140 --> 58:18.620
So you can use that to, like, they were literally, you could buy games with that.

58:19.580 --> 58:22.220
Only certain ones, but I thought it was interesting.

58:22.220 --> 58:26.540
So Zen Monkey says PlayStation 4 tournaments was shit.

58:26.540 --> 58:30.540
They only had a few games, and they took, like, two years to get it working half right.

58:30.540 --> 58:34.940
Well, hopefully the implementation on the 5 is a little bit better, but they only did

58:34.940 --> 58:36.700
have it in beta for a few months.

58:36.700 --> 58:42.220
So and they did say all of this was from feedback that they got during the beta process.

58:42.780 --> 58:48.140
They're also saying that the best PlayStation 5 players will take home accessories like

58:48.140 --> 58:52.140
the new DualSense Edge or the Pulse 3D wireless headset.

58:52.140 --> 58:55.020
And if you're a PlayStation 4 owner, you can win a PS5 console.

58:55.020 --> 58:56.300
Maybe this is the only way to get one.

58:56.300 --> 58:56.940
No, I'm just kidding.

58:56.940 --> 59:03.660
It's apparently getting a lot easier to get a PS5 console, which, by the way, I'm not

59:03.660 --> 59:05.420
getting a PS5 for Christmas.

59:05.420 --> 59:06.220
I just found out.

59:06.220 --> 59:09.900
I found out what I am getting for Christmas, but I don't want to say on air yet, but I'm

59:09.900 --> 59:11.980
hoping I'll be able to show you all next week.

59:12.780 --> 59:14.940
So stay tuned for that.

59:14.940 --> 59:18.780
But it's not going to be a PlayStation 5 because Alan and I already ruined Christmas for each

59:18.780 --> 59:19.900
other because we do that.

59:19.900 --> 59:23.180
So all right, let's see.

59:25.100 --> 59:29.900
The Winathon badge on a tournament card will allow you to sign up and start your leaderboard

59:29.900 --> 59:32.140
for a shot at these various prizes.

59:32.140 --> 59:34.700
So it's interesting that it's all built into the system.

59:35.500 --> 59:38.620
I don't think I'm good enough at games to get very far in any of these tournaments,

59:38.620 --> 59:40.860
but I think it's interesting that that's all set up in there.

59:40.860 --> 59:45.100
Plus, I don't play any of those games that were announced there, but nice to finally

59:45.100 --> 59:48.300
have parity with something from the PlayStation 4 on the PlayStation 5.

59:48.300 --> 59:53.660
But hopefully to the comment that Zen Monkey 11 said earlier, improving it as well is also

59:53.660 --> 59:54.460
very important.

59:55.980 --> 01:00:00.380
Also, just to follow up to something I said a minute ago, Shane's in chat, Chad Leland

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:05.340
saying Fuser sadly is not a physical game, so this does kill it completely.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:10.460
I thought for sure I saw a physical copy of it at a store somewhere once, but I don't

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:15.740
am I just embarrassing, bearing, affecting myself right now?

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:22.540
I thought for sure I saw that at a GameStop in the Use Games section, but I guess not.

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:23.660
Interesting.

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.940
Not even on like, was Fuser even on the Switch?

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:29.340
I don't think so.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.780
I think it was only an Epic Games store.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:32.860
On PC?

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:36.940
Oh, well, I guess it would make sense why when you consider how it all went down with

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.060
harmonics, that's for sure.

01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:39.820
Interesting.

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:40.220
I don't know.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.580
Now I'm going to look, but we have another story to get to first, so I'm going to go

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:48.060
to DarkSakura, who's going to talk to us about a big event happening this week.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.460
Indeed, indeed.

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:59.100
So, and we do sort of like razz it a little bit, but the Video Game Awards is actually

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.220
listening to people's feedback, and they're going to make it shorter.

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:06.380
It's going to be, of course, Thursday, December 8th.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:13.740
And they said that basically, that they're going to make it a little bit shorter.

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:15.820
They won't see anything officially yet.

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.180
Actually, I'll just read the rest of the quote.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.180
I won't see anything officially until we're through our rehearsals, but we think it's

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:23.980
going to be a significantly shorter show this year.

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:31.260
So they wanted to shorten the runtime because they think that there's fatigue in how long

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:36.460
the show has taken in the past, and there's lots of games and a lot of things that want

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:40.540
to be a part of it, but they're cutting those things out to streamline the show.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:51.260
They want to highlight fewer of the newer games and just point out the really biggest

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:57.020
of them, and they're feeling good about this show.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:02.860
I'm just wondering if it's even some feedback from developers like,

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.100
we don't want you to talk about all these other guys.

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.060
Just talk about us.

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.260
We're giving you most of the money.

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:12.460
I think it's probably more feedback from the people he was having to pay overtime to,

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:18.380
because I think last year's show went so long that I don't want to say he was in breach

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:23.260
of contract, but I think he had to pay extra money because they run it like a legit TV

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:23.740
production.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:28.220
He probably was in certain clauses of union agreements in the TV industry and all that

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:31.020
stuff where he probably had to pay a lot of extra money because of how long that show

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:31.520
went.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.660
That's likely what it boils down to to me.

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:38.860
Well, Tekken 8 was confirmed to be there.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.620
There's talks about the Star Wars Jedi survivor.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:48.540
Something that will not be there is anything on Mortal Kombat.

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:53.180
Basically, they're not going to have anything available, so we'll see.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.900
Um, they also are mentioning in a lot, because we're still getting a lot of the...

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:01.820
We're on the Friends of Jeff Keighley email list or something because we've co-streamed

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:02.700
the Game Awards enough.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.300
They are doing...

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.300
Now I'm like, this isn't under NDA.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.620
They wouldn't put it in an email like that because we didn't sign anything.

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:15.420
There's an in-depth look at Dead Space that they're talking about doing as well.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.660
The Dead Space remake is going to be a part of that.

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.340
So, yeah.

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:24.380
And Bobby and Chad is giving some more of the specifics about saying they had 56 games

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.300
last year, and this year they're going for 30 to 40.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.220
And honestly, honestly good.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:31.420
Like, not everything has to be a fucking event.

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.620
You know, I'm fine with it being a tighter show.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.380
It did go on a little long last year.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:38.540
But you know what?

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:43.580
I also understand completely what Zen Monkey 11 and Chad is saying, going, they should

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.060
have said, fuck the haters and made it longer.

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:53.580
Like, I also understand the perspective of, hey, this is like games legitimizing night

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.620
or whatever you want to call it.

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:57.100
This is a celebration of games and all that stuff.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.540
I wish it wouldn't end.

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.140
I wanted to go all night long.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:04.460
Now, I think because of the union contracts and the number of hours you can work and all

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:09.340
that stuff I just pointed out, that literally can't happen without a lot of money.

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.260
But I understand.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:13.820
They do like a second show that's nothing but a showcase.

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:18.460
Yeah, well, summer game fest, but you know, in the winter season.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.300
Or winter game fest too, come on.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:25.180
But I also understand there is this whole, it's a yin and yang.

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:31.180
You have to do the premieres to get the eyes to legitimize the award show.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:36.060
You have to do the award show to legitimize and get people to tune in, you know, or know

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.220
the premieres help people to tune in for the awards.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:42.220
The awards help the developers and get that prestige that they want to be a part of it

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:43.260
and showcase their premieres.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.380
It's a yin and yang thing.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.900
There has to be both, period.

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:52.860
It's just the volume of said yin and yang needs to be rebalanced a little bit.

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.460
I think some are like maybe the things when it comes to like musical performances and

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:56.940
stuff.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:03.420
Like I like the tradition of the orchestra doing the medley and all that, but they haven't

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.700
teased any performances this year, have they?

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:08.860
I don't think they really need it.

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:12.540
Like unless you're going to get fucking like Lady Gaga or Beyonce or somebody on that

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.860
level, like, and I love churches.

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:19.900
So I think perform last year, I love churches, but it just, it just makes a long show longer.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.500
And I understand why they just need to cut it down a little bit.

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:28.940
S2100 Matt says a sponsor like Verizon or whoever isn't going to pay for ads at hours

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:33.020
three and four for a long award show because they know not a lot of folks are still tuning

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:33.820
in at that point.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:37.660
Well, don't forget the commercials you are.

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:41.740
I was going to say a lot of the premieres and a lot of the things you do see in between.

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:44.860
There are commercials very slyly stuck in there.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.780
Don't forget that about the game awards.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:51.660
They very much put commercials that look like premieres or for things that are already out.

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.380
They very much will have that woven in there.

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.780
I guarantee it because they do everything.

01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.460
Yeah, promotional spots to promote.

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.140
Absolutely.

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:00.780
Absolutely.

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:04.060
E3VL says orchestra is only good if you're live.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:04.540
Well, guess what?

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.980
They're bringing it back live this year.

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:11.180
They were selling tickets to go to the LA event and they're doing an IMAX theater thing.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.380
If I remember right as well.

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:19.500
So they're, they're, they're doing, you know, a lot of different ways to get it out there.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:23.500
But anyway, I know we have some other follow ups on the game awards.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:27.180
So let me get to these other stories that are some other things related to the game

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:27.580
awards.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.080
Loki.

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.460
Loki, you with us?

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:33.740
Yeah.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.380
Oh, no.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.100
Other other things about the game awards.

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:38.480
Yeah.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:44.460
Um, so there's lots of cool stuff, like including, uh, valve, giving away steam decks one per

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.180
minute.

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.620
How fancy is that?

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:51.980
Um, so yeah, you, I guess I'm not sure how you would do that.

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:56.860
I guess if you register maybe through their site, um, yeah, through valve streaming site.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:03.340
Uh, so if you watch the game awards through there, then you'll have a chance to win one

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:09.180
per minute, which is, I think about, I think they said like almost 180 steam decks is what

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.380
they're looking to give away.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:14.060
So they just told you how much shorter the show is going to be than years past.

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:17.580
Just, just so we're clear that valve just told you how, how much shorter they're making

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.220
the show this year.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.540
Yeah.

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.380
So, um, pretty awesome.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:30.780
And then, um, one other thing that is, or not coming is an announcement by Ed Boon.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:37.020
He has said that he is, he's announced that he is not announcing anything, so it'll be

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.300
a very, I guess.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.580
Um, cool.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.020
I wait a little bit longer.

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:44.460
I believe the background on that.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.980
Cause, uh, dark soccer referenced it too.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:52.460
The background on that is, uh, that on the Xbox store, on the website, one of the two,

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:56.700
there was a, um, SGA 100 mat says announcement of no announcement.

01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:01.100
There's a reason for that because on the Xbox store, there was a nether realm studios,

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.420
like listing that suddenly showed up.

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:07.340
And I think it had a name and it wasn't, it could have been a project name or something

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.420
because it wasn't tied to any existing IP.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:14.220
But anyway, people assumed they jumped to the conclusion that Microsoft listed something

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:16.940
early that was supposed to be premiered at the game awards.

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:20.540
Uh, so this is why another realm is coming out and saying you didn't see anything.

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:23.020
We're not premiering anything at the game awards.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:29.980
To be, to be fair, he said, no, we aren't announcing the next injustice or moral combat

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:30.620
next week.

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.260
Sorry.

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:31.820
Okay.

01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:32.460
Okay.

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:38.060
So new IP, maybe, you know what?

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.700
Just fucking wait till Thursday at this point.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:41.980
I'm not going to try to read the tea leaves.

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:43.180
I'm just going to wait till Thursday.

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:51.020
Um, somebody who needs to fucking do something on Thursday is Hideo Kojima.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:55.820
And I fully expect we'll do something on Thursday because this tease it's, it's officially

01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:57.180
gone on too long.

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.460
And you know what?

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:03.100
I don't, I know I don't get to give out game awards, but I do think there is an award that

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:06.460
needs to be given out every year for shit or get off the pot.

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:11.100
And Hideo Kojima would win it this year because there is that whole fact.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:15.740
Sometimes you tease a game too much, or you tease a thing too much.

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.700
You need to shit or get off the pot.

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:22.780
That's what Hideo Kojima needs to do when it comes to his next project.

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:29.180
But in classic Hideo Kojima form, a new teaser hit his Twitter account this week that invites

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:32.940
viewers to start a new journey with three mysterious symbols.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.620
Some folks are wondering, is this Death Stranding 2?

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.060
Is this the game that has Elle fanning?

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.100
Is Death Stranding 2 also a horror game?

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.500
Because that's been rumored for some time.

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:51.260
But there's one of the logos, the APAC, the automated public assistance company that off

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.180
that sounds like something that could be like a Death Stranding 2 type of thing.

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.140
I don't know.

01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.780
This symbol was also present in the fanning teaser.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:09:59.100
I'm sorry.

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:02.620
One of the other symbols is also present in the fanning teaser.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:05.900
And of course we all heard about that video that leaked.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:12.780
So, but whatever Kojima is working on, it is officially time for him to show it.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:17.020
But now here's the good news where all this is going.

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:22.300
Hideo Kojima is absolutely besties with Jeff Keighley.

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:26.460
And if he's going to announce something, he will do it at the Game Awards.

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:33.420
And there probably is a nice, there's no more Elden Ring teases to be done unless there's

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.420
an Elden Ring 2, God help us all.

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:39.340
Actually, there's a lot of fans that game who'd really love that, but it's not happening

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:39.980
this year.

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:40.940
Not happening this year.

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:44.220
So what's going to take that last spot at the Game Awards?

01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:47.180
I think Hideo Kojima, here you go.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:48.300
It's go time.

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.020
Do something.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.060
But I look forward to it.

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:54.860
I loved a lot of what Death Stranding was trying to do.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.660
I maybe didn't get through the game start to finish, but I think a lot of that game really

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:02.140
hit hard because of when it came out.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:05.980
I know Dark Sakura followed a lot of Death Stranding and a lot of like the characters

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:06.380
and stuff.

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:07.500
And you were into this too.

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:13.020
What are your thoughts about like a sequel possibly happening in that world?

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:17.500
It'll be another game to watch because I didn't play it.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.140
I watched it.

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:25.580
No, but it's so either whether you're being serious or telling a joke, either applies

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:26.860
to be honest.

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:33.020
Because yeah, Death Stranding just came out on Xbox Game Pass for PC.

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.220
So I checked it out again.

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:39.020
And it was like an hour and a half before I actually got to move a character.

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:43.340
Because that is a Hideo Kojima production.

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.460
Trademark, patent pending.

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.860
Anyway, let's move on.

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:51.900
Something we won't see at the Game Awards, I don't think.

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.620
Dark Sakura.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:02.380
Well, you know, going back to previous statements about Activision Blizzard.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:08.460
And they're in office and out of office issues.

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:20.620
The army actually basically killed a marketing effort working with Activision Blizzard for

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:26.620
Call of Duty after the whole gender discrimination, sexual assault lawsuits.

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.060
It was confirmed just this past Thursday.

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:37.340
They had a massive marketing campaign that had Call of Duty at the core of it.

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:39.340
And now they're like, no.

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:47.020
They had a direct partnership with Activision Blizzard for sponsoring its esports team,

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.620
the Call of Duty League.

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:51.100
All of it's been cut off now.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:56.220
And the official statement is the army has no current relationship with Activision.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:00.540
The army sponsorship of Call of Duty League, produced by Activision Blizzard, was set

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.940
to expire in August of 2021.

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.100
However, in light of...

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:06.060
Wait, how old is this?

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:07.820
Okay, never mind.

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:11.980
I was talking about all the 2021 stuff.

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:13.820
It's been going on that long.

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:14.380
Yeah.

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:19.100
However, in light of the development surrounding California Department of Fair Employment and

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:23.820
the housing lawsuit, etc., etc., we paused activities ahead of the expiration date and

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.100
chose not to renew.

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:31.100
And so just go...

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:40.380
There's like, again, repeats of some of the bullshit from Activision's spokesperson, just

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:45.660
all kinds of things, but they are looking completely to make that...

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:47.260
Okay, I see what the issue now.

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:52.300
This is actually, it is an older story and I misread that, but they updated it with the

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:59.900
information from Activision saying that they were shocked by it.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:00.400
They...

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:07.580
The quote is saying that no court in California found anything to substantiate, which is bullshit.

01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:15.660
But it's just showing that we're still seeing the repercussions of it today and they need

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:16.700
to keep holding them accountable.

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:22.620
And it's also a way in which a lot of the discourse, for lack of a better term, online

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:29.100
led to this, where other companies don't necessarily want to be associated with it.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.340
Look at what Twitter is going through.

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.940
I love to pick on Twitter right now.

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:36.620
Look at what Twitter is going through right now with advertisers and how there's many

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:37.100
people.

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:42.860
And now the current owner of Twitter wants to do the name them and shame them approach

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:48.620
for advertisers, because that's always worked in trying to get advertisers on board with

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.700
your platform is to pick a fight.

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:51.500
But I digress.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:57.340
If the army really wanted to make good at it, they would be doing some cleaning in house

01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:58.220
as well.

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:00.060
They're not innocent.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:04.700
The army is not in the position to be playing morality police.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.260
I get that.

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:14.380
And on exactly the same things, tons of people are silenced for sexual assault allegations.

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:26.700
What about Vanessa Guillen, who they basically found her dead in a riverbed after she had

01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:30.940
made some complaints of sexual harassment.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.340
Very good point.

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:37.180
I'm just saying we're seeing also a lot of the pot calling the kettle black.

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:40.380
So all right.

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:47.180
Well, let's move on and talk about some new information that's come out this week on another

01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:47.500
game.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.100
Loki, yes.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:16:00.860
So apparently the ratings for Final Fantasy 16 have been discovered on the Brazilian game

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:08.380
rating board, and it kind of gives us an idea of and probably begin to be mature rated here

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:09.820
in North America.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:15.420
But we know what their ratings are based on right now, the different criteria.

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:23.020
So it lists that the game will feature sex scenes, not fully shown, intentional deaths,

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:30.700
torture scenes depicting suffering victims, drug use, prostitution, sexual content.

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:32.460
And hate crimes.

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:33.980
Hold on.

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.660
Drug use in a Final Fantasy game?

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.580
Are we going to smoke the chocobo grass?

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:41.420
Is that how does drug use factor in a Final Fantasy game?

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.060
Just injecting that material, I guess.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.300
Pestle on those geisha greens.

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:55.260
I'm very curious to see, are they going to stick to the only the drugs that were available

01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:00.300
in ancient medieval times since they're trying to use that as excuse for other things?

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:06.140
Are we only it's only going to be 100% only going to be absent or I don't even know what

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:09.100
the fuck they got high off of back in those times.

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:13.500
They'll pick something up 100% accurate to medieval times.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:20.140
Anyway, so when we say that Final Fantasy 16 is getting its influence from Game of Thrones,

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:23.420
we mean in every fashion.

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:26.220
I can't wait for the end.

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:28.620
Oh my God.

01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:29.820
Is there going to be a red wedding?

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:31.180
See anything about incest?

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.620
There's so much.

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:41.340
I think Square realized maybe there were some lines they shouldn't cross, but I'm very curious

01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:45.740
to see what Final Fantasy 16's red wedding scene is going to be.

01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:48.620
Because now I'm you're hearing a lot.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.700
I'm like all this Game of Thrones influence.

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:53.660
I'm like, there's gonna be a red wedding scene in Final Fantasy 16.

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:55.180
Just fucking wait for it.

01:17:55.180 --> 01:18:00.220
As long as they actually bring her back as the undead instead of just leaving her dead.

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.300
Like she was in the book.

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:02.860
Just saying.

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:03.340
We need it.

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:04.860
We need more vengeful undead.

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:06.940
Well, we have vengeful.

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:08.380
What do they call?

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:13.100
I want to say summons, but they're called eidolons, eidolons, titans.

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.780
I don't remember what they're calling them in 16.

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:17.580
But you know, basically that we have those vengeful spirits.

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:18.700
So we'll see.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.300
Aerith, what are you doing here?

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:27.740
Oh, DJ Rama says a red wedding scene done to the Final Fantasy six opera scene.

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.620
You're welcome.

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:31.100
Hey, you know what?

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:33.820
I mean, as long as it's tastefully done, I guess.

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:39.580
If one, if Yoshi, if Yoshi P knows how to do one thing in Final Fantasy, he knows how

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:44.140
to do a fucking callback to the earlier games and something they haven't tried to do in

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:46.860
14 yet is do the opera scene.

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:49.740
So you joke is just going to be just.

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:54.220
You, you joke Rama, but the stage is set.

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:57.180
My friend, the stage is set literally.

01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.060
So we'll see what happens.

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.060
We'll see what happens by the way.

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:04.620
That's because I believe they've said that, um, now Kiyoshita is going to be at the game

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:07.740
awards either as a presenter or some type of fashion.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.420
Ken and Roberta Williams are going to be there as well.

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.580
By the way, I noticed, uh, that came out too.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:17.260
Now, granted, um, Ken and Roberta Williams are working on a, uh, a reboot of their very

01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:21.660
first game for VR, uh, that all started during COVID cause they couldn't travel.

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.340
So, um, they're doing that.

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:27.420
So they have, but they're presenting, but now Kiyoshita is going to be there.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.340
So I wonder why.

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:30.480
Hmm.

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:32.400
Anyway.

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:33.980
All right.

01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:40.620
Uh, moving on next story, uh, for me, and it has to do with Twitch and, uh, you know,

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:42.380
yeah, further chat.

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:46.620
Well, yeah, if you're a broadcaster on Twitch, this has been like highlighted and spotlit

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.460
for you, even here on the VOG account.

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:53.260
When I logged in for the first time in a little bit today, uh, I got, uh, to see this and

01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:56.460
that is the new shield mode that they have put on Twitch.

01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.260
This is part of hate raid protection.

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:05.660
Um, now I don't, I don't want to sound naive, but I haven't seen a Twitch hate raid in a

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:06.460
while.

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:11.100
Uh, uh, I I'm hoping that means that people are losing interest in them.

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:19.420
A few people have, um, there's some who's reporting that people are like gifting subs

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:24.620
or making a sub just so that they can have a voice if they have voice to chat enabled

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:30.140
so that it will be like, and one of the people, um, was like, yeah, I just thanked them for

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:31.340
the money and then they quit.

01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:32.860
Got it.

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:35.580
So people are just finding new ways to be shitty, basically.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:41.980
You know what I did have been happening, but weekly, I did see that happen on somebody's

01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:47.420
feed, but I'm at the same mindset where I'm like, you just gave them $2 and 50 cents to

01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.260
be a, be a dumbling.

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.540
And then that's, that's it.

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:53.740
Like, I don't understand paid to be a Dick.

01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:55.500
Yeah, it's, it's weird.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:56.300
Okay.

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:56.540
Yeah.

01:20:56.540 --> 01:21:01.180
And I don't, I also, I don't want to be like naive or say just because I don't see it means

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:02.060
it's not happening.

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:05.660
I just want to say I, it doesn't seem to be as widespread.

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:07.500
I'm not seeing the social media buzz.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:11.340
I mean, granted, I'm, I'm on a site with a lot fewer people now and I used to be, but

01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:14.860
I'm not seeing that type of buzz and that sort of thing that I was seeing months ago

01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:15.660
with it.

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:16.140
A dark to see.

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.300
It does say me, she says they do happen.

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.780
She seen them on some of her favorite streamers.

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:21.820
Yeah, I got it.

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:25.980
Tiger class says $2 is chump change to them, which is why they probably did it.

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:27.820
Hey, actually it's $5 to them.

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:31.260
It's just the streamer gets two 50 and Twitch gets the other two 50.

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:34.380
But I digress multiple times, but I digress.

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:38.060
Twitch did add a shield mode this week.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:43.500
It's a one button toggle and it will activate several customizable safety features all at

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:49.020
once you or your moderators can press it and it will limit chat to followers or subscribers,

01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:54.780
require verification and implement stricter auto mod levels and immediately revert back

01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:55.820
to looser policies.

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:58.940
Once you are in the clear and you unshield basically.

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:02.300
So it's literally casting a shield on your stream in many ways.

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:04.860
There's a pair of different defenses.

01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:09.900
You can also automatically ban everyone who used a given phrase in chat recently.

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:14.700
That's nice because if people do come in spamming the same phrase, you just ban them all at

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:17.580
once or you can disallow first time chatters.

01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:19.980
You can silence people with a click.

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:24.300
You can if you want to file reports though, you have to do that one at a time, but hopefully

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.540
that process will be streamlined in the future.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.500
So that's pretty neat.

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:28.540
Yes.

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:31.340
There were a few things about it that kept me from enabling it though.

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:36.540
It wasn't tweakable enough.

01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.500
Does that make sense?

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:37.900
Yeah, sure.

01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:38.940
You want it a certain way.

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:39.440
I get it.

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:40.460
Yeah.

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:45.980
But it's nice that that's there by default for maybe the people who are newer to streaming

01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:49.820
because for like, you know, you, me and many of our friends, we've all been streaming a

01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:50.700
long time now.

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:54.220
So we all kind of came up with our own way to defend against this stuff.

01:22:54.220 --> 01:23:01.500
But the thing we need more of on Twitch is we need to invite more people, more different

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:09.900
races and ethnicities, more sexualities, more women, more by gender, a gender and other

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:14.140
genders that are out there, more people all over all the different types of spectrums

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:18.300
we have in this world to be streaming on this platform.

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:22.700
And the nice thing is a shield is something that's there by default now so that even

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:26.300
somebody new to streaming can push the button if they get targeted.

01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:31.020
Something else added on there that I heard someone mention about, but I was just checking

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:35.660
my creator dashboard and there's the option to stop raids for an hour.

01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:37.740
Oh, interesting.

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:39.980
That you can add to your quick actions.

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:44.460
And I know that some people have been using it at the end of their stream so they don't

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:45.820
feel obligated.

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.540
If that makes sense.

01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:49.020
Oh, that's smart.

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:49.580
I get it.

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:50.060
Yeah.

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.220
Because how much is that?

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:53.660
I always feel super obligated.

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:54.860
Yes, same.

01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:55.900
Actually, that's legit.

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:59.340
I don't know about an hour, but I think like 30 minutes would be great.

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:02.220
Like to not allow raids because you're wrapping up.

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:03.660
That's smart.

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.340
But you know what?

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:10.620
Twitchies takes that one step further and actually tell people you're disabling raids

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:14.460
because you're wrapping up so that people still will try to rage you in the future.

01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:18.140
Because I know I've tried to raid people and they have their rage just disabled.

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:20.860
And I go, oh, well, I guess I can't raid that person ever again.

01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:23.900
But now that I know this is a thing, I'll keep that in mind.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.060
So that's a pretty smart feature, though.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:27.900
All right.

01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.340
You know what?

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:35.180
We're going to go back in our next segment to a time long before we needed to shield

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:35.980
button on Twitch.

01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:36.620
That's for sure.

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:53.340
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:55.660
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:58.300
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:06.060
Today's classic electronic handheld is the gaming watch.

01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:11.420
It was designed by Gunpei Yokoi after seeing a board businessman on the Shinkansen play

01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:12.780
with an LCD calculator.

01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:19.180
After a meeting with Nintendo's president, Hiroshi Yamauchi and the CEO of Sharp Corporation

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.020
has given the green light to develop this concept.

01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:27.660
Yokoi adapted the simple controls of Donkey Kong, creating a cross-shaped D-pad into the

01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:29.340
first model to create ball.

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:34.220
From there, the series continued from 1980 to 1991.

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:38.140
The last game made for it was Mario the Juggler.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:45.100
A side note, this cross-shaped D-pad created by Yokoi earned a technology and engineering

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:45.820
Emmy award.

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:52.700
There are different configurations of the gaming watch over time, including dual screen

01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:59.100
clamshell models, the inspiration for the Game Boy Advance SP, the DS and the 3DS.

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:07.420
Not to mention that there were a bajillion different colors and layouts like panorama,

01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:12.460
super color, micro versus system, crystal screen, color screen, silver, gold, you name

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:12.620
it.

01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:20.540
The games themselves typically had a game A and a game B. The B version was usually

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:22.060
a lot harder.

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:28.300
There were some exceptions, like for example, the big notable ones were Judge Boxing, Donkey

01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.980
Kong 3, and Donkey Kong Hockey.

01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:31.740
The game B was a two player version.

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:36.860
There were 60 different game and watch games produced for sale.

01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:42.860
There was one still for sale and one that was only available as a contest prize, making

01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.300
62 total.

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:51.500
The prize game was given to winners of Nintendo's F1 brand pre-tournament, and it was a yellow

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:56.380
cased version of Super Mario Brothers that came in a plastic box modeled after Discon.

01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:58.540
It was used to advertise the Famicom Disk System.

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:04.860
They only made about 10,000 units and it was never available for retail, so it's considered

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:05.500
pretty rare.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:11.740
The Game and Watch series sold 14 million units worldwide during its first year.

01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:17.340
The Game and Watch version of Donkey Kong released in 1982 sold 8 million units.

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:22.860
Mario the Juggler, which was released in 1991, was the last game created for it.

01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:29.500
There's also a game called Headache, and it's the UK version of Helmet that's devoid

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:32.780
of vulgar connotations of the word in Europe.

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:39.420
The title is really hard to find because of region isolation, and it was released under

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:45.980
CGL in the UK, and it could be probably one of the rarest of the Game and Watch games.

01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:54.060
And the one Judge in 1980 had two different color schemes, purple and green.

01:27:56.620 --> 01:28:05.980
There were a number of re-releases between 1995 and 2002 with the Game and Watch series

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:10.140
after five Game and Watch collections that were released for Game Boy, Game Boy Color,

01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:10.940
and Game Boy Advance.

01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:17.340
They had the original ports as well as modernized versions with the Mario series cast.

01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:25.580
1998 onward, there were third-party distributors who were licensed to release smaller LCD versions

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:30.380
of Game and Watch that composed the Nintendo Mini Classic series.

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:38.620
2001, Nintendo released Manhole E that was bundled with the E-Reader series.

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:45.340
And although there were a whole series of Game and Watch E-Reader cards planned, they

01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.460
were never released.

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:54.780
Between July 2006 and March 2010, Nintendo produced two Game and Watch collector's cartridges

01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:59.260
for the DS to be released exclusively for club Nintendo members.

01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:04.620
The first cartridge featured three games from Game and Watch multi-screen series, which

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.700
was Oil Panic, Donkey Kong, and Greenhouse.

01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:14.220
The second collection, too, contained Parachute, Octopus, and a Noodle Screen game with Parachute

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:15.660
on the top and Octopus on the bottom.

01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.940
Both cartridges are now available to the public.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:27.100
Between July 2009 and April 2010, they released nine separate Game and Watch ports for DSiWare,

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:34.700
including remakes of Ball, Flagman, Manhole, Mario's Cement Factory, and others.

01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:41.420
In March 2010, Takara Tomy released Game and Watch keychains.

01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:46.940
Well, style keychains, anyway, based on the widescreen versions of Octopus, Parachute,

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:47.440
and Chef.

01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.540
They don't actually play the games, but just have a demo screen.

01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:54.140
They're just there to be looked at.

01:29:54.940 --> 01:30:00.140
Ball was released exclusively via club Nintendo for the 30th anniversary of Game and Watch

01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:02.540
with the club Nintendo logo on the back.

01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:07.260
Unlike the original, this one includes a mute switch, which is great,

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:11.420
for members of Japanese club Nintendo.

01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:15.740
After the announcement November 2009, it was shipped in April 2010 to platinum members.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:22.860
For members of the North American club Nintendo, it was available for 1200 coins from February

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:24.460
2011.

01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:29.180
And for Europe, there were 7500 stars from November 2011.

01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:37.260
On September 3, 2020, Nintendo announced a limited Game and Watch system that had full

01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:43.340
NES versions of Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. Lost Levels, known as Super Mario

01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:48.780
Bros. 2 in Japan, along with a variant of Ball with Mario's head or Luigi's head with

01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.420
cheat code, replacing the original character's head.

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:57.820
It was named Game and Watch Super Mario Bros., released on November 13, 2020.

01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:04.300
And this one was charged via USB-C cable instead of the button batteries.

01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:09.340
After that, we had The Legend of Zelda on June 15, 2021.

01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:13.420
It was released, not released, but revealed for the 35th anniversary.

01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:19.020
We had four games, Legend of Zelda, Zelda 2, Adventures of Link, Legend of Zelda Link's

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:23.820
Awakening, and a variant of Vermin, with Link replacing the original character's head.

01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:26.380
That was released on November 12, 2021.

01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:34.780
The system itself was pretty influential over the handheld market.

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:39.740
Many different toy companies followed that, including Tiger Electronics with their Star

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:40.380
Wars games.

01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:47.660
And each of these little units, basically, these were the precursors of Game Boy.

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:53.900
The cartridge system incorporated into that with the screen and everything.

01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:59.740
Again, Yokoi's invention pretty much rendered the Game & Watch obsolete.

01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:06.220
At any rate, there's also Game & Watch Gallery, where you can watch the games' videos.

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.220
They imitate the LCD displays.

01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:12.860
Again, like I said, they had been re-released through DSiWare.

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:17.260
There's a DS release of Cooking Guide, Can't Decide What to Eat.

01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:21.100
You can unlock both A and B versions of Chef if you use the timer function.

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:26.940
Nintendo Land for Wii U has a minigame called Octopus Dance based off of the game Octopus.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:33.180
And Game & Wario for Wii U, which is a play of words on Game & Watch, has many different

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:39.500
references to the Game & Watch line, including a Virtual Game & Watch version of Puyo called

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:39.820
Bird.

01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:46.140
This also led us to Mr. Game & Watch, who became a very popular Smash Brothers character.

01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:55.900
He was redefined and redesigned to make him work in a 3D environment, but he is purely

01:32:55.900 --> 01:33:04.540
two-dimensional and he uses the sound equivalent of the sounds from the Game & Watch games,

01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:05.820
which you'll hear in the video.

01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:13.340
And of course, we got the Amiibo version, where he has different versions of the character

01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:15.580
that you can reattach for different poses.

01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:23.580
And he can be scanned and create a personal CPU that can train and fight using artificial

01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.140
intelligence.

01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:29.500
The Amiibo is also used to unlock a cosmetic option for Super Mario Maker.

01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:32.060
And there you go.

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:33.500
That is the Game & Watch.

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:37.500
And it's a pretty long history.

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:40.300
All right, there it is.

01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:47.900
The Game & Watch, the final classic handheld of the month for this year, as I typically

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:52.780
do in December, because we've done a little twist on this classic game segment for quite

01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:53.980
a while ever since.

01:33:53.980 --> 01:34:01.020
I think the first year was, and I have to refer to our Wiki to remind me, 2017 was the

01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:02.380
classic console of the month.

01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:06.300
2018 was the classic peripheral of the month.

01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.820
2019 was the classic 8-bit soundtrack of the month.

01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:13.180
2020 was classic pinball of the month.

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:18.540
2021 was, oh, I love this one, the flag, the fucking weird arcade game, the flag of the

01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:18.700
month.

01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:19.580
That was actually really hard to do.

01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:20.540
That was a lot of fun.

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:21.580
That was a lot of fun.

01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.100
It was hard, though, to find material.

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:23.580
Oh, it was.

01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:24.700
It was, but you had a good list.

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:31.420
And then 2022, the classic handheld electronic game of the month, starting off in January

01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:38.860
with Tron, February with electronic football by Mattel, March with the game.com system,

01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:47.100
April with the Puyo Lin, May with the Tamagotchi, June with the Digimon electronic handheld,

01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:54.460
July with Bandai Terror House, August with the Cosmic 1000 Fire Away, September with

01:34:54.460 --> 01:35:01.260
the Tommytronic 3D series, October with the Coleco tabletop arcade collection, November

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:03.580
with the Nelsonic game watches.

01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:07.500
And then finally, of course, of course, you knew when the segment was announced, this

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:11.980
one was coming at some point, the Game & Watch, capping it off in December.

01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:16.540
You know, I have to ask, are we and I know we've talked about it previously.

01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:19.260
Did we decide finally on a 2023 theme?

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:20.940
Were we going to roll with that cage match theme?

01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:21.820
Because I love that one.

01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:23.340
But it's up to you, really.

01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:28.220
I do like the cage match idea that it's going to take work.

01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:29.500
Yeah, I think.

01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:35.660
And part of me wants to table that for like a special thing.

01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:37.820
Oh, like a like a bonus stream.

01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:42.220
You know, we owe our listeners a bonus stream from a year ago still, but completely my fault.

01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:43.980
But I love that maybe as a bonus stream.

01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:44.540
That could be fun.

01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:54.460
Well, and what I'm thinking about doing instead is the classic 80s toy.

01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:57.420
Oh, interesting.

01:35:57.420 --> 01:35:58.860
Like toy lines.

01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:04.940
Oh, so departing the realm of video games, but maybe not because there's a lot of 80s

01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:07.420
toys that in turn ended up influencing games.

01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:13.420
So or, you know, on the same same thing I could do.

01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:19.900
No, no, I'm trying to think of like specific.

01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:25.900
My thought is board game or card game, because there's a lot of that stuff that comes over.

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:26.620
But I don't know.

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:27.180
It's up to you.

01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:31.820
There's some that have just been like classics already, you know, that were out before then,

01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:34.460
like the original Cluedo, for example.

01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:35.280
Sure.

01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:43.020
You know, going back to old battleship, you know, I could maybe I could do very specifically

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:48.060
games from the 80s, like physical games.

01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:50.140
You know what that means, though?

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.540
Crossfire.

01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:55.100
All right, well, I'll let you marinate on it.

01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:56.700
Don't don't finalize.

01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:58.220
No, I'm going to do that.

01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:00.380
Do you do 80s board games?

01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:04.300
Board games are interactive games.

01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:06.700
Competitive games and no magic.

01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:11.180
Magic, I think was 89 card games are not going to go into it.

01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:11.680
Okay.

01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:12.880
All right.

01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:13.740
That's it.

01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:14.220
That's it.

01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:16.300
So put it on the wiki.

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:16.940
It's coming up.

01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.940
Now I got to watch all this crossfire commercials.

01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:19.440
Yeah.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:20.000
All right.

01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:26.060
All right, let's move around the industry quickly at a rapid pace and talk about what

01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:28.620
else is going on in rapid fire news.

01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:29.420
We'll start with Loki.

01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:35.500
So Fortnite chapter three has just ended, and now we have the tease for chapter four.

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:39.500
And we know some of the things that are going to be coming into that as well.

01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:44.220
First off, they're going to be updating the graphics of the game.

01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:47.980
It's going to be running on unreal 5.1, which looks pretty awesome.

01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:54.780
And then along with that, though, we have teases for Doom guy, Gerald from the Witcher

01:37:54.780 --> 01:38:08.300
series, and Azuki Midoriya, I don't know why I couldn't say that from what was that?

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.140
It was My Hero Academia.

01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:18.380
And also, I believe there was cameos, at least as part of the cut scene from chapter three

01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:19.660
of Hulk.

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:22.940
And then also there's dirt bikes in there now.

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.060
And Mr. Beast.

01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:28.300
It's just an amalgamation of like all sorts of weird stuff.

01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:35.500
It's like the multi or like it's like Ready Player One almost at this point, kind of.

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:38.860
And then this is kind of funny.

01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:42.540
So Uncharted is getting a roller coaster.

01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:43.820
That's right.

01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:46.940
It's not coming to a park, at least near me.

01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:57.580
But in, I guess, Port Aventura world, they're going to be getting a ride based off of Uncharted

01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:59.820
and that's going to be in Spain.

01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:04.700
It's their largest theme park there, and it's coming out middle of next year.

01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:09.900
And apparently it's a dark ride roller coaster.

01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:11.580
Well, it sounds like fun fun.

01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:15.500
Oh, yeah, that makes me think of like the mummy at Universal.

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.260
Hollywood is a dark ride roller coaster.

01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:18.060
That's a lot of fun.

01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:19.360
Yeah.

01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:23.340
I'll never forget the first time I rode that ride with Exeter, and we had no idea what

01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.500
to expect when the thing started going backwards.

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:30.300
We screamed so loud that like we were crying, but it was a lot of fun.

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:32.460
Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:34.940
A couple of things.

01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:41.260
There is a second closed beta announced for Street Fighter 6.

01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:45.580
They've done some tweaking to some of the characters.

01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:51.580
Actually, they've done quite a bit of bug fixes on it, balance adjustments.

01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:57.580
And they also have put in the Avatar creation.

01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:03.900
You can't save or load recipes for them or remake them during the beta, but you can make

01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:04.400
them.

01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:09.660
There's different features like cross-platform play, different control types, commentary,

01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:18.060
all of that was there and commentary by characters in the game.

01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:27.420
I think like different people like Vicious Tasty Steve Aru, Kosuke Hidaiwa, and other

01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:27.920
people.

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:32.640
Then there are different stages playable.

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:40.560
Metro City, Genbu Temple, Carrier, Byron Taylor, Chun Hong Yuan, the macho ring in the training

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:47.120
room, and different game center challenges, different battles, different modes, all kinds

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:47.620
of stuff.

01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:53.280
So it looks like it's going to be just a big push over the last one.

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:56.160
I had a lot of fun playing this at TwitchCon.

01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.200
So I'd like to get in on it.

01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:05.840
I don't know if I can do it, but it is open for Steam players as well.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:09.200
Xbox 5, Xbox Series, and Steam.

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:10.800
You know what?

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:14.400
Capcom specifically needs somebody to test this whole Boosteroid thing.

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:16.400
So I think you should write him an email.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:18.020
Yeah.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.060
All right.

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:24.080
Well, if I could, I've been having some issues getting some stuff to play on Boosteroid.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:24.800
Oh, no.

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.020
All right.

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:27.540
All right.

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:31.360
Moving on to what is going on in PlayStation Plus.

01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:36.640
December's monthly games have been announced, and an OLR Fave is a part of it.

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:39.120
Actually, a whole OLR Fave trilogy is a part of it.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.360
These titles available from December 6 to January 2, including Mass Effect Legendary

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:45.840
Edition.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:46.400
That's right.

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:51.440
If you want to play the original trilogy, but all the DLC included, the all-in-one,

01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.280
optimized for 4K, all the things, that is available now.

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.400
So check that out.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:02.160
You can also check out on PlayStation 5 slash PlayStation 4 Divine Knockouts Founders Edition

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:04.720
that is launching, they say, directly into PlayStation Plus.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.760
You know, Rocket League got its start that way.

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.680
So sometimes some big games come out of that.

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.400
And then Biomutant, part melee shooting and mutant ability action.

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.440
It's an open world RPG that is available on PS5 and PS4.

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:22.560
So those are your free PS Plus games.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:23.200
Go grab them.

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.040
If you're an Xbox person, I don't have the games.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:30.560
I think we talked about it last week, what's coming out for games with gold.

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:35.520
But I can tell you what's coming to Game Pass, which is available, which I saw a long time

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.560
listener, Dark Tetsuya, and I, we talked a little bit on Mastodon, and Dark Tetsuya talked

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.640
about that they got an Xbox Series S.

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.880
And so I think that's pretty cool.

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:48.400
So they were like, I know him and Mish were like, what game should we get?

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.800
And I was like, honestly, if you can afford it, just get Game Pass.

01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:56.160
So Dark Tetsuya, Mish, and everyone else with an Xbox.

01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:58.320
Here are some of the things coming out for Game Pass.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:01.600
Eastward is coming to Cloud, Console, and PC.

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:06.640
The Walking Dead, The Final Season, and Total Reliable Delivery Service.

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.080
Those just came out.

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.840
On December the 6th, LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga.

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:13.040
Hello Neighbor 2.

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:14.880
That is actually a day one release.

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:18.400
December 8th, Seized Chained Echoes and Metal Hellsinger.

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:21.600

And yeah, those are all coming out real soon.

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:33.360
So check that out if you're an Xbox Game Pass person.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:34.720
All right.

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:38.240
Meanwhile, let's check out what's coming out to the retail shelves.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:42.080
I don't think this is a busy time of year for retail, but sometimes we're surprised.

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:44.560
So let's travel around and check out some release dates.

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.160
Loki, how about the US?

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:53.280

Chuchu Charles on PC, and Dragon Quest Treasures on Nintendo Switch.

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:47.600
That's it.

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.120
All right.

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.240
Traveling over to Japan.

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:53.760
It's a pretty busy week still on the Nintendo Switch over in Japan.

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.560
Witch on the Holy Knight is released in a regular and limited edition.

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:59.600
Those are coming out in English, but it is a Japanese release.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:04.400
That's Sukai Tenki that Loki mentioned is also out in a regular and special edition

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:05.840
on Japan this week.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:10.720
Idol, Janshi, Sushi, Pi, Saturn, Tribute is out in regular and limited edition as well.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.800
It Takes Two gets a release on the Switch in Japan.

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:17.360
That was a big game at last year's Game Awards.

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:20.880
So if you want to check that out in Japan, that is out on the Switch this week on December

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:21.520
the 8th.

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.560
Atlee, Ariza 1 and 2, a double pack is out on the Switch this week.

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:30.720
The Rumble Fish 2 is out in English, but it is being released in Japan this week.

01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:34.800
Dragon Quest Treasures is also out a little later in the week on the 9th.

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:41.360
But then Kanken Smart Taisaku and Aiken Smart Taisaku are both out on the 8th.

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:47.920
On the PlayStation 5, I don't think we have a lot this week in Japan.

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.000
They're just there is a Pulse 3D wireless headset that's coming out in Japan.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.400
I think that is a third party headset.

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:58.000
And then other than that, really Far Cry 6 gets the Gold Edition release.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.480
I think that's just a repackaging of a prior release.

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:03.840
But that is also out on the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan.

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:06.480
Dark Sakura, what's going on in the UK?

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:13.920
In that, what we have is on the 6th, Hello Neighbor 2 for PlayStation.

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.280
Also on the 6th for PlayStation, Xbox Five Nights at Freddy's Collector's Edition.

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:24.400
Cuckoo's Lost Pets on those and the Switch.

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:28.560
Also for the three of them, we have Redout 2.

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:31.440
We have, it looks like a big Cuphead collection.

01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:36.320
On the 8th, we have My Universe, My Baby Dragon for Switch.

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:39.120
On the 9th, Dragon Quest Treasures, also for Switch.

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:47.360
For Switch and PlayStation on the 9th, we have Adventure Academia, the Fractured Continent.

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:52.240
I'm sorry, since you said My Baby Dragon, now all I hear in my head,

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:55.040
now who that is, My Baby Dragon, now who that is.

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:55.760
All right, forget it.

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:58.560
I was thinking of like the Baby Monkey song.

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.760
Baby Monkey, Baby Monkey.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:06.640
Baby Dragon, doo doo doo doo doo, Baby Dragon.

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:07.680
No, I don't know.

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:09.280
I don't know the song.

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:15.840
Can you believe I have made it this long with not really hearing the whole song?

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:16.640
Really?

01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:19.280
That's, do you think you'll win Whamageddon as well?

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:24.800
No, I lost Whamageddon already and thanks to Nick, I lost the Mariah apocalypse.

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:27.920
I don't mind the Wham song.

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:33.760
I like the Wham song and I like the Paul McCartney one, even though it's really kind of weird.

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.200
But I loathe the Mariah Carey song.

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:41.680
Oh, I don't know.

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:44.000
Your voice actually kind of annoys me.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.400
I don't know if I'm technically winning that or not because I haven't heard either one yet.

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:53.840
Well, technically I haven't heard both of them, but I did hear when I was picking up

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.120
high the other day.

01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:00.800
I heard a cover of the Mariah Carey song, which I didn't realize there was a cover of

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.080
that, but I heard that.

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:04.480
So I don't know if that counts or not.

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:10.720
I made it through the Mariah apocalypse for four years until someone finally got me with

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:11.220
it.

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.160
And that was actually last year and it was dro.

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.640
Honestly, look, they, they ought to add Kate Bush to the list and I love Kate Bush, but

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:22.560
man, ever since that four seasons Stranger Things came out, you cannot do a trip to the

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:27.440
mall and not here running up that Hill anymore.

01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:29.120
I guess.

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:30.480
I guess I'm the weird one.

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:30.800
All right.

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:33.120
I still think malls are fun, even if they're empty.

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:34.180
All right.

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:38.160
Honestly, I need to go to a Sephora soon.

01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:40.800
Go check out round one at the Galleria too.

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:41.760
It's a lot of fun.

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:43.120
Well, I don't want to go by myself.

01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:43.840
I'll come.

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:44.400
Just tell me one.

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:44.880
Okay.

01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:45.380
All right.

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:50.240
Sj 100 Matt with a very good point in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:54.160
Loki talks about pie, but he doesn't say what pie he got.

01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:58.720
I didn't get pie for me because I don't like pie.

01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:01.120
I got a pumpkin pie for my wife.

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:04.000
Oh, that's like several weeks ago.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.120
You, you bought the pie and you didn't even eat the pie.

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:07.760
That's love.

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:08.800
That's love.

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.040
All right.

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:09.920
I don't like pie.

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.840
So it's easy thing for me to do.

01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:14.000
That's so say this in Alabama.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.760
I did have some good sweet potato pie.

01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:22.080
Pumpkin pie is one of those things that like, you know, ever since my diagnosis, it's like

01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:25.200
the one thing I allow myself as a special treat like once a year.

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.840
So it's a big ever had sweet potato pie, Rob.

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:28.640
Oh, I have.

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:29.280
Yeah, of course I have.

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.920
I've had sweet potato sweet potato is, is far superior to the pumpkin.

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:35.680
Oh, well on that you're wrong, but that's okay.

01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.280
Everybody has their own opinion.

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.920
I am absolutely 1000% correct.

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:42.400
Correct.

01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:43.600
All right.

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.840
Look one thing we can agree on.

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:46.880
Did you do the UK dates?

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:47.680
You did the UK date.

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:47.920
Sorry.

01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:48.080
Yes.

01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:49.520
Cause I was making fun of baby dragon.

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:49.760
All right.

01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:54.960
One thing we can agree on is that Yuzo Koshiro is awesome.

01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.960
And so Loki, what is our next story involving Yuzo Koshiro?

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:08.080
Yuzo Koshiro is developing or at least working on a brand new mega drive and Genesis game.

01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.560
It looks to be a side scroller shmup.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.800
And along the lines of like a Gradius or something like that.

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:16.400
It's awesome.

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:21.200
There's not much that we know about it yet, but there's different ideas that he's been

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:25.520
floating around basically saying that maybe they'll sell physical cards for it.

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:31.200
It's like a whole Twitter thread about it, but yeah, I mean, it sounds cool.

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.560
Sounds like he's excited about it.

01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:35.840
I'm excited to hear about whatever this is.

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:40.080
Um, you're, you're, you're probably let's, let's be real.

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:43.760
Yuzo Koshiro is probably making one of these so we can get bought for inclusion on the

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.760
Genesis mega drive three mini when it comes out inevitably.

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:49.920
Cause it sounds like the type of thing.

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:50.720
I hope it's in there.

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.240
Yeah, that'd be good.

01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:54.480
S2100.

01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:58.400
Matt on a, on the pie topic asks, have you had keto pumpkin pies, Rob?

01:50:58.400 --> 01:50:59.600
Curious if those are actually good.

01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:00.800
I have not made one.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:02.720
Are they good?

01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:03.280
I don't.

01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:04.960
A lot of mine was really delicious.

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:07.520
A lot of the sugar free or whatever they do to it.

01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.200
Substitutes can be kind of meh.

01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:09.680
I don't know.

01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:13.760
Sometimes, sometimes even with keto though, they mix a little sugar with the sweetener

01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:16.320
stuff and it goes along with mine was all Splenda.

01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:16.820
Okay.

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:23.920
And my crust was, um, crushed walnuts and, and butter.

01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:25.600
Okay.

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:31.120
So it stuck to the thing and you got the, the texture, but it was, it was really, really good.

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:31.920
That makes sense.

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:34.320
Flipping out the crust like that probably goes a long way.

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.840
So, but you know what?

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.440
I can have the real thing in moderation.

01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:39.040
I'm still doing very well with all that.

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:43.360
So, you know, it is, you know, I, I, if you don't allow yourself a little cheat here and

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.880
there, you'll fall off the wagon hard.

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:48.400
So a little cheat here and there is how I avoid falling off the wagon hard.

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:49.520
All right.

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:51.280
Moving on.

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:52.960
I think we're to dark Sakura.

01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:54.480
Ooh, this, I love this story though.

01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:03.120
Well, I have to say I actually got myself caught up in a little bit of, uh, uh, a rabbit hole.

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:07.280
So I'm going to get right back to that because I was looking up, um, board games.

01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:13.920
Um, which by the way, I've solidified my idea and I have just about everything except for

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:15.280
one month already lined up.

01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:25.440
Anyway, so our Google doodle, uh, very recently honored the man, the legend, Jerry Lawson.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:35.120
And Jerry Lawson, you know, for people I have to remind was, are basically the person that

01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:41.040
gave us the interchangeable video game cartridge gaming system and created his own company

01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:44.000
called video soft in the early 1980s.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:50.320
And that company became one of the earliest, uh, black owned video game development companies,

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:51.280
according to Google.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Um, and his children, um, Anderson and Karen said that he loved what he did and he did

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:00.640
what he loved.

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:07.760
And they thought that his achievements were quite remarkable given, you know, the way

01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:09.840
things were in, sorry for the noise.

01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:10.560
Sorry for the noise.

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:12.560
I actually brought up the doodle to play a little bit.

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:15.600
Oh, I didn't hear anything in early eighties.

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:24.960
Um, but, uh, also, um, he did die in 2011, but that same year he was recognized by the

01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:28.720
international game developers association as an industry trailblazer.

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:34.720
And his achievements have also been memorialized at the world video game hall of fame in New

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:35.040
York.

01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:40.800
Uh, his children say that they wanted to thank Google for working with them to share, uh,

01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:46.080
his story in a doodle, which is a game by the way, and said, may his story continue

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:50.560
to inspire numerous young people around the globe to achieve something remarkable.

01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.160
It was a great tribute.

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:56.880
I loved it.

01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:57.440
Yeah.

01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:58.640
So it's nice.

01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:04.880
And remember next time you, you know, dust off the, the nest or even put in, you know,

01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:10.160
of a game desk, all that is because of this man.

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:12.320
Well said.

01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:16.960
I'm glad, I'm glad history is remembering him a lot better than it used to.

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:18.880
So cool at Google to do that.

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:23.280
All right, moving on a few more stories for you, and then we'll get to our listener round

01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:26.560
table where we invite your calls over at twitch.tv.

01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:27.040
Excuse me.

01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:31.440
Well, you can also, uh, chat along with us at twitch.tv slash vog network, but if you

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:35.120
want to call us, you got to go to discord vog network.com slash discord.

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:37.280
That's VOG network.com slash discord.

01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:41.680
And you want to join our green room and the green room is how we will bring you on the

01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:43.120
air to chat with us.

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:47.440
So, uh, we will get to that in a moment for now though, we have a couple more stories

01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:49.200
for you starting with Loki.

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:50.320
Yeah.

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:56.480
So apparently it's been revealed that from software engages in some level of crunch,

01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:02.880
according to some, uh, anonymous sources from, uh, different employees within the company.

01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:06.400
And this is through a game industry biz.

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:09.840
They kind of interviewed some of these about different things that they encounter while

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:10.480
working there.

01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:16.240
Um, one said, you know, during critical periods of game releases, I often had to work early

01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:18.480
mornings and overtime for two to three months.

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:25.840
Um, another one said if it's, if it's not as if crunch happens on a daily basis,

01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:36.800
um, it's not excessive over time, but it's, it's so called, uh, for during the, um, I

01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:40.320
guess, uh, during some of the parts of the release.

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:47.200
So, um, I, they were also talking about their salary as well.

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:53.840
Um, that, uh, basically it's generally included in the salary, uh, regarding the compensation

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:58.480
they get for crunch, but that the compensation was not necessarily adequate for some.

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:04.720
And, um, didn't appear that from software didn't appear dissatisfied with their salaries

01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:05.200
either.

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:05.440
Okay.

01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:06.800
We'll give them more money.

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:15.600
I mean, um, but yeah, so, uh, that they're still struggling to get things right.

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:18.560
But if you get over the bump, it's very satisfying.

01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:22.240
Just like defeat of Boston, dark souls said one employee.

01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.040
So, I mean, I understand it crutch sucks.

01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:33.680
Um, I know that a lot of companies still do that, but I mean, as long as they're not doing

01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:39.040
it in a whole ton, I still like the idea that they are doing it at all, you know, pace your

01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:44.880
games a little bit better, but at least it's not all the time, at least they're honest

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:45.520
about it too.

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:49.520
I mean, it doesn't excuse it, but at least the employees are honest about it.

01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:56.160
I mean, because, you know, uh, and they have to be anonymous about it, but yeah, the truth

01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:57.120
always comes out eventually.

01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:57.360
Right.

01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:58.720
Exactly.

01:56:58.720 --> 01:56:59.040
Yeah.

01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:00.720
All right.

01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:04.240
This last story tonight, this actually came from discord.

01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:08.560
So SSJ 100, Matt actually submitted this on discord and it was too good to not have as

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:10.080
a final story for tonight.

01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.880
And it is about a brand new console that's coming out, but it's, um, not exactly.

01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:17.440
Why would we put a console in the last spot?

01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:18.960
It's not a console for humans.

01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:23.760
It's the Joypah, which is a console that is for dogs.

01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:29.760
And yes, it is a console that is designed for dogs to play games designed to provide

01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:32.400
physical and mental stimulation for dogs.

01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:37.680
It was initially conceived as a means of alleviating, alleviating boredom and separation

01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:40.480
anxiety for a puppy when it's home alone.

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:45.040
But Joypah says the console has a potential to offer cognitive benefits for dogs could

01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:49.440
also help onset the, uh, or excuse me, help delay the onset of canine dementia.

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:52.640
A lot of the same benefits they talk about in humans as well, which is interesting.

01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:54.080
Why is it going to be dogs?

01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:56.000
Uh, yeah, I know.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:56.320
Right.

01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:59.920
I'm, I'm hoping for the Meowpah or something to come after, but we'll see.

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:05.680
Anyway, a dog would use their, a dog will use their nose to play on the console's touch

01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:10.800
screen and will be rewarded for correct choices via a treat dispenser.

01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:13.600
As Joe and her mat is saying, it can be adapted for cats.

01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:14.560
Well, that'd be cute.

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:16.800
Uh, Joypah games, including whack-a-mole challenge.

01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:17.760
I know cats won't care.

01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:22.960
Although if you, if you put like an iPad down, cause I remember there was an iPad cat thing

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:24.720
and a cat just basically scratches at the screen.

01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:27.440
That's, that's basically all that like meow mix or something did that.

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:28.240
I don't know.

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.400
Anyway, we don't know when this is coming out, uh, but you will be able to put, you

01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:37.920
can get one now if you put down a re uh, fully refundable deposit of $6.

01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:41.120
And that means you get a 5% discount on the final purchase price.

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:42.960
How nice, how nice is that?

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:46.960
And by the way, speaking of how nice I actually have just for the folks that are watching

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:50.880
live, I have a little video of, uh, this in action.

01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:54.800
And for those, uh, that, um, are listening on the podcast feed, you see a good little

01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:55.680
dog there.

01:58:55.680 --> 01:59:00.880
Who's, uh, looking at some moles on the screen and actually tapping the moles with his nose.

01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:05.520
And you see the owner is trying to like show the dog what to do, but the dog's like, I

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:06.240
just want a treat.

01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:07.920
I just want a treat.

01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:12.720
And so the dog taps the little whack-a-mole thing and eventually gets a treat.

01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:16.880
I don't think that dog really wanted a treat, but, um, treats, treats are available.

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:18.160
That is a very pretty dog.

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:19.920
My goodness, my goodness.

01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:21.200
Anyway, there you go.

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:22.160
That's the joy paw.

01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:26.800
It looks like it would be cute for dogs.

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:32.320
I just hope they don't make the games too violent or with too much sexual content, you

01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:35.280
know, like that's, that's a real problem in the industry.

01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:37.680
And I just don't think we need to be subjecting the dogs to that.

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:42.000
I, I really hope that they, you know, consider some of that with, uh, the game making.

01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:47.200
Um, uh, I can't see it comes up with some other names for this.

01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:50.880
Paw station, Wolf Tendo, Skinner Barks.

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:53.440
I think that's supposed to be like X-Box because there's an X in that.

01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:57.520
Anyway, uh, dark tissue says rated E for every dog or cat.

01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:03.040
Uh, Zen monkey says people are going to love it until their dogs start jumping and knocking

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.000
over the TV.

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.720
Oh, the truth of that comment.

02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:10.880
The truth that be very careful with your setup.

02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:11.520
That's for sure.

02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:12.640
All right.

02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:17.600
Let's get to the listener round table where we invite you to participate with our show.

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:22.000
Uh, you can send us an email every week and participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.440
I don't think we got anything this week.

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:25.920
Sadly, did we?

02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:26.560
No, I see that.

02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:28.880
I see the, the, the reverse notters.

02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:32.880
So, uh, we did not get any emails this week, but participate at orange on radio.com.

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.240
If you want to send it for a future week.

02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:38.800
However, we also take calls here on this program via our discord server.

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:41.120
And if you want to call into the show, you can go over to the green room.

02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:43.040
We actually have somebody on the line.

02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:45.600
So let's bring them in and have a chat.

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:46.640
Hello.

02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:48.000
You're on orange launch radio.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:48.480
Who's this?

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:52.080
Hi there.

02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:54.160
I don't know if you can hear me, but you're on orange launch radio.

02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:54.560
Who's this?

02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:56.160
Oh, can you guys hear me?

02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:56.880
Yes, we can.

02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:57.360
Hi there.

02:00:58.400 --> 02:00:59.600
Hey, I'm AJ twist.

02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:01.120
Hey, I recognize the name.

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:01.680
How are you?

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.000
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.560
I haven't called in a long time, but I've been listening to you guys for forever for

02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:09.280
years now.

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:09.680
Thank you.

02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:10.640
I appreciate that.

02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:12.960
I'm a podcast listener.

02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:14.800
Well, I'm so glad you could join us live tonight.

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:20.400
I wanted to talk about the Smash world tour.

02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:21.600
Oh, please do.

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:23.760
Because can you make any sense of this?

02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:28.160
Because this is worse than an episode of Jerry Springer, to be quite honest, with all the

02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:29.600
he said, she said.

02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:30.960
What's going on?

02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:32.880
Yeah.

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:35.520
Well, just give you a little bit of background myself real quick, too.

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:39.280
I've been playing Smash for years, probably a little longer than I've been listening to

02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:39.680
you guys.

02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:41.920
And I got a tournament.

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:47.840
I've gone to evil over 10 times by now over since like 2004.

02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:50.880
So I've been following the scene for a long time.

02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:56.800
And the Smash community itself, just fighting games in general, is all grassroots.

02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:02.160
So it's kind of scary to hold tournaments sometimes with the fear of the companies shutting

02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:07.120
us down, which is definitely happened with Smash Brothers, probably more than what we

02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:09.360
know from what I've heard in the past.

02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:13.680
And then what was going on recently with the whole Smash world tour?

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:16.400
They're actually, I think they were hosted by Panda Global.

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.080
So Panda Global and Nintendo teamed up to do the Smash world tour.

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:26.320
And then what was going on behind the scenes, the CEO of Panda Global, I think his name

02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:28.640
was like Alan Allen something, I think is what his name was.

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:34.240
Supposedly, he was going around to other tournament organizers and telling them that they should

02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:39.120
sign up under Panda to do their tournaments, because if they don't, Nintendo is going to

02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:41.040
come through and shut them down.

02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:46.800
So he was talking to all these organizers, scaring them into signing up under his whole

02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:47.300
thing.

02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:51.200
And I think Nintendo heard about that and got involved.

02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:58.880
But on top of that, Nintendo is just, I don't know, they don't love their fans or something.

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:05.600
Every time there's an event and they say they're okay with it, they end up turning around

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:07.680
sometimes and being like, no, we're not okay with this.

02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:15.440
Something else like referring back to EVO 2013, where EVO almost had to take down Smash

02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.040
Brothers because of Nintendo.

02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:22.640
What happened back then supposedly too was, you know, Nintendo got word that Smash was

02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:23.440
happening at EVO.

02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:25.280
They're like, no, no, no, we need to stop this.

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:28.960
And then within hours, I think they're like, you know, backed off like, no, never mind,

02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:29.440
you're all good.

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:30.240
Go ahead and stream it.

02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:35.920
But supposedly what happened was it was the marketing department that was the one that

02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:41.360
wanted to shut down Smash Brothers that year, because that year was the same year that they

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.920
were to announce Smash, I don't know, Smash 4 or whatever game was coming out that year.

02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:51.360
And so then he wants people to go look at the old game when there's a new game coming

02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:51.860
out.

02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:54.080
So there's that whole thing too.

02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.000
So I feel like Nintendo, go ahead.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.160
Well, no, I was just saying, it's interesting to me because I get the sense that like Nintendo

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.680
seems to have like a working in silos type of problem.

02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:06.560
And I don't know if that's between the different departments, kind of like you illustrate there

02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:09.840
with the marketing department wants to do one thing, but the PR department wants to do

02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:10.560
another.

02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.000
Japan wants to do one thing.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.360
The US wants to do another.

02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:18.240
Like Nintendo has a serious communication problem within themselves that I think is

02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:19.760
really showing in this story.

02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:21.200
Exactly.

02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:22.400
That's what I was thinking too.

02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:25.760
It's like they're an octopus and one hand isn't talking to the other hand, it's not

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:27.440
talking to the other hand, that's like the other hand.

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:29.840
So they're all over the place sometimes, I think is what it is too.

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:34.080
I think what ended up happening with that whole marketing department thing, almost shutting

02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:40.560
people down that year, was that it was supposedly a rumor that the wife of one of the head CEOs

02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:42.800
over there, you know, was like following this.

02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:44.720
And she's like, no, wait, you guys stop it.

02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:45.840
You know, this is a good thing.

02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:47.280
And then, you know, they turned it around.

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:50.560
But yeah, but that's a whole crazy thing.

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:54.960
And that's kind of like, you know, my, my, you know, news or what I can give you about

02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:57.360
this whole Smash World Tour thing, what's going on.

02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:01.280
And now the whole Smash community is kind of scared now because Nintendo is talking

02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:06.480
about licenses and, but they're like, but you guys could do your tournaments, but like,

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:09.680
but you might want a license because if you don't have one, we're going to shut you down.

02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:13.840
But at the same time, the World Tour, Panda Global had a license and they still shut it

02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:14.080
down.

02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:15.280
So I was like, are we safe?

02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:16.080
Are we not safe?

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:17.680
Like, you know, what should we do?

02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:21.840
Because, yeah, because they're, they're not able to, Nintendo's not able to communicate

02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:23.440
with itself, which is ridiculous.

02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:28.960
It's just, it's, it's, Nintendo needs to have probably some type of written sort of policy

02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:32.800
with this, or at least I imagine they probably do, but they're not enforcing it consistently.

02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:37.280
It's just, or I also, I'm also reminding you, Loki, you got into this last week when this

02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:42.000
whole thing kind of first came up is that you were talking about, it's reminiscent of

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.840
Nintendo's YouTube policy.

02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:46.960
Remember when they were like, if you want to, if you want to show a Nintendo game on

02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:50.640
YouTube, you got to be through our creator program and we get 30%.

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:57.200
And it's like, you can't, you can't, Nintendo does not have the muscle to police that.

02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:00.080
They just, it's a good thing that their games are good.

02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:04.640
Cause if they weren't, I mean, their community building is not great.

02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:09.120
I know they really let rest on how strong some of those games resonate with people.

02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:13.680
Well, let me ask you this, AG twist, because you are, you said you've been with the smash

02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.520
scene a long time.

02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:17.360
How does this make you feel as a fan?

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:19.680
Like, are you still an avid fan of smash?

02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:23.840
Cause you just kind of look past all this or are you like, dang, maybe, maybe it's time

02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:25.200
to pick up Tekken.

02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:28.000
Like, I don't know, like what, where do you come from as a fan?

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:32.560
Actually, I play more Tekken than smash, honestly, as of lately.

02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:38.080
How much of that is because of this bullshit?

02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:40.480
That's a good question.

02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:46.880
I don't know, those are my friends, honestly, but I would like to participate in more smash

02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:47.680
tournaments and stuff.

02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:51.680
Just being older now, I don't really have the time, but I still try to support when

02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:56.720
I can maybe join a tournament when I'm able to definitely watch some of the Twitch streams

02:06:56.720 --> 02:06:57.920
and stuff like that when they happen.

02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:03.840
But mostly I like going to locals that are not usually streamed.

02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:08.000
So if we can still do our locals and Nintendo's not going to shut those, you know, you know,

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.480
comic book stores or small arcades, you know, those are not going to get shut down, then

02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:14.880
I will still try to play Smash when I can.

02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:20.160
But as far as bigger tournaments, I mean, I go to Evil often and I would definitely

02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:24.720
join Smash Brothers when it's there at Evil, but it hasn't been in a while.

02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:29.440
So if it's not at Evil because, you know, because Nintendo, then I guess I'm not going

02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:31.520
to really play any Smash at any tournaments.

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:33.760
Big tournaments.

02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:34.400
Good point.

02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:39.120
I hope Nintendo hears, but maybe one person in Nintendo is hearing it, but can't seem

02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:41.040
to communicate it to anybody else within Nintendo.

02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:45.760
They also don't like that they play modded Smash as well is one of the problems.

02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:47.360
Yeah, that's the other thing, too.

02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:54.320
Yeah, they try to do a tournament using Slippy, which gives the GameCube Smash Melee online

02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:55.360
connectivity.

02:07:55.360 --> 02:08:00.240
And they shut that down for one big tournament like last year, two years ago, because it

02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:01.280
was during COVID.

02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:03.440
And of course, you have to do the tournament that way.

02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:05.200
Oh, that whole thing was ridiculous.

02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:06.480
Yeah, that's stupid.

02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:14.080
Yeah, I just Nintendo needs to read the room or they need to start hiring some people who

02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:15.360
are reading the room.

02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:20.000
Like, maybe what Nintendo could do is hire some Smash tournament organizers to really

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:24.720
represent them in these discussions, because it's just a mess.

02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:26.160
The whole communication thing is a mess.

02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:28.000
And I feel like they just don't understand.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.120
A lot of it's probably just old school ways of thinking.

02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:34.720
The old guard has been running Nintendo for a very long time.

02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:38.880
And I think maybe some of that probably needs to be shaken up a little bit, or it's going

02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:41.920
to come back to bite them because they're going to look to those fans to really push

02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:43.120
the next Smash game.

02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:44.400
And I'm sure you know what?

02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:50.000
I'm sure the next Smash game will sell oodles and oodles of copies, whether Sakurai is involved

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:50.560
or not.

02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:54.080
Just having the name, it's going to sell millions from the go.

02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:58.160
It's just the way it is with those franchises, but it's just kind of one of those.

02:08:58.160 --> 02:08:59.920
It could do so much more.

02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:06.640
It could be featured in comic book stores and makeshift arcades throughout the nation.

02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:12.800
If Nintendo would just let the community be a community instead of trying to get 10% of

02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:13.920
it, it's just silly.

02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:21.680
I'll be very curious to see what happens with the panda resignations, though.

02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:25.520
That adds a whole other interesting element to this to be continued.

02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:28.000
Yeah, I'm kind of interested in that, too.

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:32.960
Yeah, I want to share one more other thing, not related, though.

02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:36.160
But kind of to give you a little more background, I guess what I do.

02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:39.840
What I'm about to do right now, I'm actually outside my friend's house.

02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:41.840
We're about to play some fighting games.

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:49.120
Every weekend we get together, play fighting games, and we do a small tournament amongst

02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:50.080
ourselves.

02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:55.120
We have Mjolnir, we have Thor's hammer, and that's our trophy for the night.

02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:58.800
So out there getting some practice rounds, we do a bracket tournament.

02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:01.040
Sometimes there's like four of us.

02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:02.320
Sometimes there's like eight of us.

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:06.800
And then whoever wins whatever game we decide that night, they take home the hammer for

02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:07.120
the week.

02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:08.320
I love that.

02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:09.360
That's awesome.

02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:10.000
That's awesome.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.680
It's like, you know, I bet there's a lot of like board game fans that do something similar

02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:17.840
to that have a prize that they pass amongst themselves for whoever, you know, is the winner

02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:18.640
or so forth.

02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:23.360
And that's when the fighting tournaments, fighting game tournaments are or any game

02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:28.560
tournament, really, DDR, you name it, is the most awesome is when, you know, it's so

02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:29.600
community driven like that.

02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:33.840
And I think that's why it sucks to hear about what Nintendo is doing here, because it's

02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:36.240
like, it makes people scared to do this.

02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:40.240
Like, is Nintendo going to cease and desist your circle of friends if they find out about

02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:40.720
it?

02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:44.400
It's at what point, but at what point do you draw the line?

02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:45.920
True.

02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:46.400
Yeah.

02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:48.320
And sometimes we do try to stream it too.

02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:51.520
So like, if we do Smash Brothers one night, I might be in fear.

02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:53.520
Like, I don't know, guys, maybe we shouldn't do this.

02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:57.040
If Nintendo can't even communicate where the line is.

02:10:58.080 --> 02:10:58.580
True.

02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:02.240
But anyway, I hope you don't let that stop you.

02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:03.120
You know what?

02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:04.400
We've all got your back.

02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:05.680
We'll go, we'll go fight.

02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:08.800
We'll go, we'll go, we'll go fight people if we have to on your behalf.

02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:11.600
Uh, and you have Thor, you have Thor's hammer.

02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:13.280
You can fend people off.

02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:18.400
You know, when you start, you know, issuing out some thunder and lightning, though, I'd

02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.240
be really interested in that.

02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:23.360
Tiger Claw in chat says Thor's hammer is the prize.

02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:24.560
I hope the winner is worthy.

02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:26.240
Well, obviously they proved themselves worthy.

02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:26.880
Tiger Claw.

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:27.680
That's the point.

02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:27.920
Yeah.

02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:31.280
SG100Matt says that is awesome.

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:34.080
Really brings me back to my high school days of playing games.

02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:37.760
Well, I'm going to guess if AJ Twist has been listening since the beginning of OLR.

02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:42.800
AJ Twist is no longer in high school, but, uh, I think that's awesome that you can still

02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:44.240
kind of live, live that.

02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:46.560
So yeah, it is something we like to do.

02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:47.760
That's all the news we can.

02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:49.840
And I don't have the hammer right now myself.

02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:55.040
You know, I might need to go win it so I can, uh, lumb out some lightning.

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:55.920
What's on deck tonight?

02:11:57.120 --> 02:11:57.760
Don't know yet.

02:11:57.760 --> 02:11:59.040
I'm about to walk in and find out.

02:11:59.040 --> 02:11:59.920
I'm hoping Tekken.

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:03.920
I would prefer Soul Calibur or maybe Smash Brothers.

02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:06.560
Maybe it could be a ironic and go play some Smash tonight.

02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:09.040
I love some irony.

02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:10.720
So I'm rooting for Smash Brothers tonight.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:12.560
All right.

02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:13.440
Good luck to my friend.

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:14.080
Win that hammer.

02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:16.080
All right.

02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:16.400
Thank you.

02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:16.880
Have a good night.

02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:17.520
Thanks for the call.

02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:17.920
You too.

02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:18.400
Bye-bye.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:20.480
That's great.

02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:20.800
Thank you.

02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:22.160
AJ twist for the call.

02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:23.360
Really appreciate that.

02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:24.400
I was, that was great.

02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:27.680
If you want to call us, uh, in a future week, uh, join our discord

02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:29.440
server, vog network.com.

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:32.000
That's vognetwork.com slash discord.

02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:35.360
Great to hear from somebody we haven't heard from in a long time as well.

02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:37.440
Um, and we, we love the regulars.

02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:38.400
Please do not get me wrong.

02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:42.320
We love them, but we also love to hear from friends that have been lurking in

02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:45.760
the podcast, uh, shadows, so to speak for some time.

02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:46.320
It's awesome.

02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:49.520
I just wanted to check in real quick before we wrap it all up and see if we

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:51.120
have any last minute stories.

02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:53.280
Loki, I know it's not really the time of your forum.

02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:54.160
I've been looking.

02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:54.720
All right.

02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:55.360
I thought I would.

02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:56.000
Thought I wouldn't.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:56.480
All right.

02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:59.200
Well then I guess we'll go ahead and we'll wrap it up for tonight.

02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:02.320
So thank you all so much for listening to orange launch radio tonight and

02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:06.480
participating with our show, uh, whether it was your first episode or your 939th

02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:08.560
episode, we appreciate you being here all the same.

02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:09.920
Tell a friend or two about the show.

02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:12.960
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:14.880
But we need more voices to put out on air.

02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:15.600
Hello.

02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:19.520
So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or wherever it is,

02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:22.080
you found this podcast, those going off a long way.

02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:23.840
And we super appreciate those.

02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:27.920
I did, by the way, this is the time of year where like the Spotify and

02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:30.160
podcasters get one of those.

02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:32.880
And so I got to see that there's all these different countries around the

02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:34.240
world that listen to the show.

02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:38.160
And did you know there's more people, there's more people listening to us in

02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:43.280
like, I want to say it was, it was what I think the Philippines was actually

02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:46.880
the number two most listened to country above Mexico and Canada.

02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:47.680
Was the Philippines.

02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:51.200
I want to say I have to go back and look, sorry, I had a mic mishap here.

02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:53.520
I have to go back and look to be sure, but I thought that was really cool.

02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:56.880
So hello to our, uh, folks that are listening out there that are helping

02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:58.800
to inflate the numbers out there.

02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:01.360
So I appreciate that.

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:01.760
All right.

02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:04.640
Um, we've got a really good VPN.

02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:08.480
Maybe, maybe also the only bummer about that.

02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:11.920
And the reason why I didn't post it publicly on any of our social media

02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:17.280
channels, it appears to only assess the last 10 episodes because our

02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:20.160
podcast feed is only the last 10 episodes.

02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:24.080
So unfortunately, I guess Spotify doesn't hold the statistics for the

02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:24.960
older stuff.

02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:28.480
So that is true anyway, for the last like three months or something like

02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:28.720
that.

02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:30.320
So I thought that was interesting.

02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:31.280
So, all right.

02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:31.920
Anyway.

02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:33.920
Um, that's it.

02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:36.320
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.

02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.680
Um, dark Sakura, I'm you're back on the dead bite.

02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:41.600
You're back on some dbd bullshit.

02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:44.880
I mean that in the nicest possible way tonight after the show.

02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:46.320
So I imagine you want to go set up.

02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:48.000
So do you have any final thoughts for us?

02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:51.920
Um, not really.

02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:52.960
People are stinky.

02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:56.880
And for some reason, my stream deck never wants to stay connected.

02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:02.000
So, oh, well, everyone try not to suck.

02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:03.040
All right.

02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:03.760
I'll do my best.

02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:05.840
Good to have you back tonight later.

02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:06.080
All right.

02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:06.320
Bye.

02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:07.520
All right.

02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:09.120
Loki, how about you?

02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:10.240
What's your final thought for the night?

02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:15.120
Uh, hopefully look forward to a brand new video from me very soon.

02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:16.560
Yay.

02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:17.280
I'll be awesome.

02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:22.880
Uh, and my final thought is, um, I don't know.

02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:28.720
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go hook up with wow later tonight, I think, but I'm gonna go walk because

02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:32.960
it's important to get out and walk and do all that stuff too.

02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:36.880
And I haven't been able to like literally all weekend because it's been raining, but

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:38.720
I think we finally have a break in the rain.

02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:44.240
So I need to go plant some flowers in Pikmin Bloom because I left it out of my gaming week,

02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:47.920
but I hit level 69 in Pikmin Bloom.

02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:48.880
Nice.

02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:51.360
All right.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.800
That's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.

02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:58.240
We'll be back in seven days on December the 11th to do it all again.

02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:00.080
I hope you all have a wonderful week.

02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:01.120
Thanks.

02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:02.800
And we'll see you next time.

02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:03.200
