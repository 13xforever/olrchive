00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Not being much of an RPG person, I only now learned Final Fantasy 3 didn't see a release in the PS1 Final Fantasy releases Anthology Chronicles of Origins, not seeing release in the West until the Nintendo DS in 2006.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Two decades later, Screenix is releasing all six of the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters for PlayStation 4 and Switch next year. Apparently only physical releases?

00:27.000 --> 00:37.000
This is the re-re-re-release news with probably 10 more reads needed. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.000 --> 01:00.000
I think it's digital individually. But anyway, hi, hello out there, my friends on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with episode number 941 of our program for December the 18th of 2022.

01:00.000 --> 01:10.000
A holiday season officially underway in many sorts. My name is Rob Roberts and I am here with my co-hosts as they are every week. Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh, hi.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Hello, hello and I hope you're having a good Hanukkah. It's it's night one.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
It's great when I get to start setting stuff on fire and butchering Hebrew.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Perfect.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Sounds like a celebration.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
It was I had everything all set up and then I was about to do the oil. I'm like, I don't want to do the oil this year. So I just got really good candles.

01:30.000 --> 01:40.000
There you go. That works. I was up. I was actually playing Pokemon Go earlier today. I'll get into gaming weeks and stuff. But as I was trying to walk a lot.

01:40.000 --> 01:48.000
I ended up as I often do down near the Capitol building and they had a little a whole little setup there. It's kind of off to the side.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.000
But it's I don't want to make it sound like they kind of othered it because like if you're taking a shot like straight down at the Capitol, you have the big giant tree in the middle.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.000
But now they have like a menorah that's on the right side that would show up in the frame too. And it looked like they they were probably I mean, I was there like three o'clock, so it was still light out.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
I imagine they were going to do a big ceremony at sundown. But yeah, so it was nice to see that.

02:11.000 --> 02:20.000
That's cool. Yeah. I haven't made any latkes yet. I've had some tummy trouble, but I'm planning on doing it at some point this week.

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
That was an OLR tradition I miss back when we were live and in person. We'd often get some potato pancakes on the first night of

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
The first night it happened to me that the show was on but yeah, and and the house would smell like potato deliciousness.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Mm hmm. Good times.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Maybe maybe one day.

02:41.000 --> 02:53.000
Maybe one day one day we can you know what I'll eat potato latkes anytime I don't give a it's just I'll drink it I'll drink I'll eat a gingerbread cookie anytime like it doesn't have to be the holidays. Let's be clear.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Hello.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm doing pretty good.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
You got one of my very faves playing behind you. I actually I can't tell if that's the stage from Jumpman or Jumpman Jr. on.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
It's the original Jumpman on Commodore 64. Love it. One of my faves. Was that something you were playing this week?

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
Well, yeah, because I'm well, I met Randy Glover, the creator of Jumpman.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh, get out.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Well, how'd that happen?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
And I also got I got this.

03:28.000 --> 03:37.000
Oh, there was a convention. I there was a convention here in town. Wasn't there like one of those gamer expos over at the Scottish Rite?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
And so he was there. They were they had Jumpman. I've never played Jumpman.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
I played Jumpman Jr. and I was playing on the Coleco Vision, which is like, oh, yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
He's like, I didn't I forgot that there is one on the Coleco Vision, I guess, because he's like I did the Commodore 64 in Atari.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
I don't know if he ported it or someone else ported it to the Coleco Vision.

04:00.000 --> 04:09.000
But yeah, I did get the medium and then they had a raffle as well as going to charity. So I entered the raffle and I won.

04:09.000 --> 04:18.000
Well, I had three choices. I get one bag of buttons, a second bag of buttons or the button that was on his shirt signed by him.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
And so I got the button on his shirt signed by him that says creator of Jumpman.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Nice.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
Nice. I didn't I didn't know in the gaming industry we took people's clothes and had them autographed.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
I thought that was I thought that was just at the Magic Mike show. But here we are.

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah. So yeah. So yeah, I did. I met him this week. But yeah, I was like, Jumpman Jr. was like a game like my fave game.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Going back to the Coleco Vision. It was like one I played all the time.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
In fact, when I got the Coleco Vision mini thing that they had, that was the reason why they had Jumpman Jr. in it.

04:55.000 --> 05:03.000
So it's awesome. I really like that game. I am not very good at it, though, because, well, they had a Commodore 64 mini playing it.

05:03.000 --> 05:12.000
And I was I've never used a Commodore 64 controller. I mean, it's sort of like an Atari controller, but I'm just not used to the old joysticks anymore.

05:12.000 --> 05:22.000
So it's yeah, it's it's that game is like so touchy anyways, as it is like you have to be very precise with your jumps and like getting right to the edge and stuff.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
That controller is not meant for that.

05:25.000 --> 05:35.000
I was gonna say Jumpman Jr. is on the C64 mini as well. And I would imagine the C64 regular one that they just put out not long ago.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
I don't know if I have 25 bucks to buy the cartridge.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
The actual Coleco cartridge?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I've got two Coleco Visions.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
Oh, wow. That's and you know, when you say cartridge, it's funny because a lot of people forget the Commodore 64 actually had cartridges as well.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
And I actually had Jumpman Jr. as a cartridge on Commodore 64. So yeah, I always forget that that computer had cartridges, but it did.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
So that's the version for Coleco Atom and Coleco Vision.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
You know, that was a game I didn't have I had like Mouse Trap and Carnival and Space Fury and Turbo and stuff like that.

06:10.000 --> 06:19.000
A lot of those ports back in the day were done by other people, though it wasn't often I mean, look at a game like Pitfall, right? David Crane's Pitfall for the Atari 2600.

06:19.000 --> 06:29.000
That game was ported literally you name it in the 80s. They put Pitfall on it right in one form or another either Pitfall or Pitfall to the Lost Caverns was even on like the Sega Master System.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
I think it's a port of the arcade game or something, but but I digress. They weren't all David Crane.

06:34.000 --> 06:49.000
So it's interesting how, yeah, oftentimes other people would end up being responsible for translating, you know, a game over and with mixed success, sometimes look at, you know, Pac-Man on the 2600, an infamous example, certainly not done by the same folks.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
If they were kind of behind some limitations, they're like, well, we need to we need you to fit this much game into this much space.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
It's like, well, I can't do that without making compromises. Too bad.

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
You know, but yeah, I think I've seen that they've done like some fan conversions or stuff like that using a larger ROM in it.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
It looks pretty close, but yeah, yeah, it was cool to meet him.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
And of course, he is also behind Summer Games and Summer Games, too.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.000
So, oh, yeah, epics they were given I wanted like because like the way it was working is like, OK.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
The person that wins the raffle, you get to pick one thing and then it gets down to the end.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
So they had a sealed copy of Jumpman for the Commodore 64.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
I wanted that. And then they also had a Commodore 64 mini. I would have taken that, but they're fine. It's fine.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah, the pins fun. That's fun.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
I want to hear more about the convention, but I do want to go to our chat room, of course, and get some comments because we do tape live every Sunday night.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
At nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
That's VOG Network. And we're on right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although Bobby Black Wolf not on tonight,

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
as him and Mrs. Black Wolf are celebrating the holidays a little bit early this year.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
But Bobby will be back next week on December 25th.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Yes, even on that day with a new episode of his program.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
And I know he has missed you all because he was out last week as well, but he'll be back next week.

08:11.000 --> 08:18.000
So hello to everybody in chat. Tigerclaw pointing out Jumpman was Mario's original name, if I recall.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah, that was his name when he was the villain in Donkey Kong.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Or no, I'm sorry. Hello. He's the villain in Donkey Kong Jr. Hello, bang bang.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
He was a hero in Donkey Kong. But yes, I believe they did call him Jumpman in that game.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah, yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:41.000
So I wonder if maybe because of Jumpman Jr's success, because Jumpman and Jumpman Jr, those games weren't just big in the US.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
Keep in mind, the Commodore 64 was huge in the UK. Huge.

08:46.000 --> 08:53.000
So I wonder if because Jumpman kind of ended up being part of the pop culture, you know, lexicon over there, they had to find a new name.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I don't know. I mean, it would be an interesting documentary someday.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
Far above the ZX Spectrum and its other computer systems.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
So the CDC, all that.

09:05.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah, all of it. You know, it's so funny how in this day and age, we're always like, oh, it's PlayStation versus Microsoft versus Nintendo when like in the 80s, there were like 10 different things all competing at once.

09:16.000 --> 09:26.000
There. I mean, I remember I'm dating myself, I don't care. I remember magazine ads that would show off a game like let's say I think actually mousetrap would be a good example.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
And it would say it was Oh, actually, it was always like the Parker Brothers ones for Commodore 64. Like Frogger. Frogger is a great example.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
It would have here's everything the Commodore version, the Apple two version, the TI 99 4a version.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Amiga.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Maybe not for that particular game, but later ones. Yes.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
The and the 2600, the 5200, the Coleco vision, the it was it was literally everything.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
I remember the Tandy computer. Oh, yeah, the cartridge that you shoved it up on the side of it and the silver keys.

09:58.000 --> 10:12.000
Can one of you can one of you Google experts like Tiger Claw or something since I'm live trying to do a program could what do you find like one of those 80s ads that shows that like look for like an old Frogger ad or like Popeye I think had one if you remember that game.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
I would just love to like show that on screen as like an example here.

10:16.000 --> 10:32.000
And and have a little better detail for those that are listening on the podcast feed because even though we do tape live on Sunday nights, of course, we are available as a podcast as well on most of the places where you can find podcasts such as Spotify or iTunes or what have you.

10:32.000 --> 10:42.000
Tiger Claw sent me a YouTube link. I was looking more for a picture but I can't like upload the thing but yeah, I see here. I'll post it in chat real fast.

10:42.000 --> 10:50.000
Um, but yeah, it's basically got a bunch of different versions of the game box floating in water.

10:50.000 --> 11:02.000
So it's like in, in television, like in the 80s. That's close. That's close. Yeah, I see what you're doing with all the different boxes. That's close. I saw the one depth put to the, those are close but it's not the one I'm thinking of.

11:02.000 --> 11:19.000
Well, but you know what ads looks like back then where it wasn't just like like ads today or like, here's a picture, you know, yeah, and then, you know, and then in the past, it was like, here's a complete novel and backstory of every one of these games, I found

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
it I found it okay how do I get this image copy image address. Okay.

11:24.000 --> 11:37.000
Yes, this is what I'm going to let me show this on the other screen here sorry I am doing this is the joy of doing things live sometimes but I'm doing it live. So, what you can see here this is an ad for Popeye, and you actually see all the different screens it

11:37.000 --> 11:48.000
shows the 5200 the Commodore 64 I'm going to put this link in chat as well. The Atari 400 and 800, which I which I even forgot was a system.

11:48.000 --> 12:01.000
So and so on. So that's, that's, yeah, it shows like all the different systems there. I'll put that link in chat to I promise, just easy, but you could just see the scope of like all the systems that things were on. So it's just, it's just wild. Anyway.

12:01.000 --> 12:15.000
All right. Loki, I said I said I would ask you about the convention. So what else did you see? Because what's funny, I got pushed a Facebook ad for that convention. And it was the first time I'd heard of it, but I got the Facebook ad on Saturday night. So it was like the thing was half

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
over already. And I was like, well, I'm not gonna go today.

12:18.000 --> 12:38.000
And I didn't stay very long. There's not a lot to do there. If you unless you're watching panels, which I wasn't the whole reason I was going there was because there was some people I wanted to give physical copies of my game to just because either promotion or I figured they would enjoy it like john riggs.

12:39.000 --> 12:57.000
One he he does. He has a YouTube channel. He's got like, like gaming nostalgia stuff that he does. And I've been wanting to send him one for a while. And I just haven't really bothered to look up his PO box or whatever. And so I saw that he was going to be in town. So I was like, Okay, cool. I'll go give one to him. And then

12:58.000 --> 13:17.000
so he was there. And so I got to meet with him and talk about like he does some game dev as well a little bit with his friend. And so he had a few games that he was selling as well. So we got to do that. And then he actually bought a copy off of me as well for his friend. So I actually sold one.

13:18.000 --> 13:42.000
And then there was who else was there? Joey Ferris with game explain. So I saw him there. I've recognized him forks. I think I follow him on YouTube as well. And then I know gamer dad was there. And there's one other guy I don't remember I think it may have been this Gabbo the giver, who is like this pixel game squad thing. They they look for NES games and stuff.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
I'm gonna assume all these content creators are based out of SAC or the Bay Area.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
I don't think so. I know. John Riggs is not I don't think content creators specifically.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
Oh, God, you can't do my voicemail. Yeah, yeah, I bet.

14:46.000 --> 15:01.000
Sung in Mortal Kombat two as well. So, yeah, they had a different, different group. Daniel. He's, he's also a doctor, apparently. So he has a book called Mortal doctor, which I think that's funny.

15:16.000 --> 15:45.000
They usually were set up. So they didn't really want to play anything. I walked around the vendor booth area a little bit about Contra knows about it. Like, I don't know, there was stuff that was kind of expensive, like in specially they had games that were marked up quite a bit in the condition that they were in was just not good. I was looking for some indie games and stuff, too. They've had a few guys that had a indie NES games and stuff. They're not homebrew. And I was looking for some of that, but it just wasn't wasn't being it.

15:46.000 --> 16:15.000
So we were in and out in about an hour, like, honestly. But I mean, it's fun if you like, you know, the panels and stuff and want to see like some of these people and get their autographs or whatever. It's a good time. I mean, and we lucked out because the last time we went, it was a week earlier. And that's in the middle of that stupid Sacramento marathon that they have the international one. So getting to the Scottish Rite Center was just a pain because it's the marathon run literally goes right past it.

16:15.000 --> 16:42.000
And so all the streets are blocked off, whereas this year is a week later. So it was just like, no traffic, easy in and out wasn't super crowded. So it's good. And I ended up giving away about like, four copies of the game and I sold one. So five, five pixel poops, number two out there. And funny enough, like, John Riggs had messaged his friend like showed him a picture what it was. And the guy's like, Oh, yeah, I just bookmark that page today. So

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Wow.

16:44.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah, it'd be fun. Like if people just get the plate and stuff. The one there was digital clips was there too. And I should have talked about publishing, but I didn't didn't get around to it. So it's all right. You blew it off. You had your chance. Sorry.

17:02.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah, it's just awkwardly. Yeah, I get it. You have to be in the right mindset. Yeah, so it was it was okay. But yeah, that's really the whole reason I went is just to give out copies of the game. That sounds like fun. I haven't got it. I got to make more because I'm out. Well, I have two left, but I'm out of physical copies of the first 12 at least I wish I'd known I would have gone. I just Yeah, it wasn't on my radar, unfortunately. So yeah, it's too bad. But I have to keep an eye out for the next one. So it's fun. Yeah. All right. Well, let's get into some gaming news.

17:32.000 --> 18:01.760
We'll come back and talk about our gaming weeks. We want to definitely get Dark Soccer's gaming week and I have some stuff too. So we'll get to that. But first, let's get into our kind of lead topic for tonight. Although I mean, this is this is kind of an ongoing saga. And let's be real. We're getting into that time of year, you know, with with a Hanukkah starting us off tonight. We all know then that it's Christmas, then it's New Year's all the other winter celebrations as well. We know that the news is going to slow down a little bit. So but we'll, we'll push through with what's out there. We still have some ongoing developments in the

18:02.060 --> 18:06.200
Microsoft and Activision Blizzard saga. Yes, Loki.

18:07.440 --> 18:31.920
Yeah, so there's just more news coming out about that. And I think they've already kind of said that as well. But Microsoft offered Sony call it I mean, first off, they've offered Sony Call of Duty on their platform for 10 years if they're willing to sign an agreement for it. And then also with that, you know, they're saying that, you know, they also offer to put it on their PlayStation Plus

18:31.920 --> 19:01.080
service as well, to kind of, you know, be an extra thing that they could offer for their new users to kind of spice up PlayStation Plus and make it a little bit more valuable, I guess. But I still think that they're basically saying that's still not enough. And same, I think like the FTC and like the European Union are also investigating everything because they feel that it's not competitive enough.

19:01.080 --> 19:31.000
Once again, like, I get it, it is not it, it is the lack of competition. But like, why this and not discovery? Like, that's, I still, I'm still like scratching my head over that way. Because like, like, I get it, this could harm Sony down the road. But at the same time, like they would do the same in a heartbeat. Like, I, I don't doubt it. But you know, when I see that type of merger, like with discovery and Warner Brothers and HP and all

19:31.000 --> 19:59.240
that stuff, like, I feel more harm is being done there. And like, then this, granted, and I'm sure that Sony sees the writing on the wall, like even a 10 year agreement doesn't, that's 10 years, that's like, you know, another console cycle, and then they have the advantage in that they see that that could be a problem. But I guarantee if this doesn't go through, they will try to buy do the same thing. And then in ironically, it'll probably go through because that's how the world works.

19:59.560 --> 20:29.120
I'm looking in chat for some comments. DJ Rama S in chat says Sony needs to stop whining. As 2100 Matt says, I think we all know if the roles were reversed, Sony would offer MS nothing. They tell him to kick rocks. I feel MS is going out of their way to make this work. I'm actually curious if there's anyone in chat, and I promise no judgment. We want to get all the voices here. I'm curious if there's anyone out there that maybe agrees with the FTC side of thing and does not want to see the Microsoft and Activision Blizzard merger go through and maybe what the reasons are for

20:29.120 --> 20:58.920
that. I mean, admittedly, and I kind of my opinion really hasn't changed. What I said a couple weeks ago is it's like I don't love the dog eat big dog sort of thing that the games industry is becoming. I don't love it. But it's this particular circumstance where something needs to change at activism Blizzard where I'm fine with it. Even though yes, I realize it's a huge company. Microsoft's also a huge company and it is going to give them a huge share of it. I I'm not sure I'm convinced it's giving them a larger share than what Sony has.

20:58.920 --> 21:28.800
Sony Sony has a large entertainment arm that they could integrate better with PlayStation that they're simply not doing. And I've said this before on the show, PlayStation Plus, how much of a bigger deal would that be if it actually gave you some Sony movies? Some Sony music, right? I guess it does give you like Crunchyroll, which is Sony owned or like a trial or something. I don't know. Like it gives you some limited Sony things, but it's it's not at the level that you

21:28.800 --> 21:48.760
would expect Sony could offer where Microsoft doesn't have a CD label or a music label or that I Well, a large one, a major one, I should say that I know of, or an entertainment production company, really. So it's, I think it's Sony's own fault. They're not leveraging things more. I don't know.

21:48.760 --> 22:17.240
And, and they are doing the same thing on a smaller level. I mean, they're making individual deals with different game studios to basically put it on their platform for a year before it gets to go on any other console platform. And they do that quite often. And they gate a bunch of stuff like Spider-Man in, you know, a lot of it funny enough is around Square Enix, but like gating off Spider-Man from the whole Microsoft platform for the Marvel Avengers game.

22:17.960 --> 22:47.000
Which is just stupid. But that's something that they do. Yeah, I really don't I have a hard time believing like, at least, you know, you have this company that's saying, Listen, we're committed to bringing this to your platform still. Like, I mean, if it were me, like, like, after all this bullshit, I'd be like, you know, all that Skyrim stuff and all the new Elder Scrolls games. Well, fuck you guys ain't getting shit now.

22:47.400 --> 22:59.880
causes problems with Activision. We're, we're fucking cutting that shit off. Yeah. I don't know, like, I would be, I mean, that's what's gonna come is, you know, yeah, oh, yeah, starfield, Nat, you ain't getting that shit.

23:00.840 --> 23:26.480
I also kind of wonder, like with Microsoft being willing to make so many concessions on the Activision side, if it if it isn't really Blizzard, maybe King, but I feel like it's Blizzard that they really want. Like, I feel like Microsoft really wants Diablo, Warcraft, Overwatch, and that whole that even though I don't know, I'm hearing that maybe Overwatch two isn't performing at the level that people thought it would.

23:26.480 --> 23:56.360
I don't know. I feel like a lot of that stuff I'm looking at is kind of slanted based on people's biases one way or the other. So I'm not I'm not sure what the facts really say about that. But it seemed like Overwatch two at least had a huge launch. But admittedly, they just had a new season start. And I could care less, but I'm playing a different Blizzard product. So maybe it maybe it's all the same as long as as long as I'm doing something right. But anyway, my point is, I wonder if it's Blizzard that Microsoft really has their eye on. I don't know.

23:57.000 --> 24:05.320
Maybe I mean, I don't know, like, we'll have to see what happens to this whole thing anyways. Because like, what's gonna happen to Activision? Like if this doesn't go through?

24:05.320 --> 24:35.080
I don't know. They get bought by Tencent. And then I believe that would actually be worse. I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash a vog network. Mike deaf says I don't agree with the FTC. I understand why people would be fine with it. But this is a good move for everyone. At least involved. As Joe and her mat says this will take a lot longer now that these antitrust suits that are coming. It's really not going to be finalized one way or another until 2024. So DJ rama says PlayStation is keeping Sony afloat. Yeah.

24:35.320 --> 25:05.280
And also adds Microsoft teamed up with crunchyroll for free trial subs. She hold 10 says I would rather Xbox set spend the 70 billion on a new super game and studio from the ground up. To be fair, Microsoft did buy a boatload of studios. They do have a lot of those. And I'm not sure we're seeing oodles and oodles of things coming out of it yet. But I think we're gonna like I think it's coming. And we've seen a few I you know, obviously, we had like Psychonauts two, you know, we'll, we'll see some more. But to be fair, they did

25:05.280 --> 25:13.480
spend a lot of money on like smaller studios to try to build them some some new things. I can't see what's up.

25:14.040 --> 25:20.320
Whatever happens. I'd like to see though that the biggest defenders get canned immediately.

25:20.640 --> 25:34.760
Oh, God. Yeah, that's that's the number one thing I can't wait for is for Bobby Kotick to be unceremoniously removed. I mean, it sucks because he's probably gonna get a big payout because of contracts and stuff. But not just him. Oh, no, yeah, not just him. But he's he's he's like

25:34.760 --> 25:54.080
that. He's he's the it's just like eBroom plus is not the only problem at bird app right now. But he's the one you want to see go most of all. But he has he has a team of enablers just like Bobby Kotick does. So I don't know. Anyway,

25:54.080 --> 25:59.240
thing is, is that in the long run, though, all of these people that are like this are a symptom of a bigger problem.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.480
Oh, sure. Absolutely.

26:02.040 --> 26:06.800
Yeah, when you start holding those people accountable, the problem starts getting resolved.

26:06.800 --> 26:15.880
Yeah. And that's, I've referenced that on previous episodes, too, is that this is a game industry problem. That's what this this whole issue became much bigger than Blizzard is

26:15.880 --> 26:20.960
much more than a gaming industry issue. Oh, sure. This is institutionalized.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.960
Sure. I'll agree with that. Yeah.

26:24.280 --> 26:30.720
It's just the fact that it comes out in the biggest boys club that there is, but you see it all over the place in the corporate world.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.040
It's exacerbated by the gaming industry.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.960
This is what it's like to work as a female.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.520
Just saying it doesn't matter where you go.

26:39.520 --> 26:45.760
Even the most enlightened of companies, you're still going to you're still going to encounter sexism.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.520
It's it's there. It's ingrained.

26:48.520 --> 26:53.760
You have to start holding people to the fire in the worst possible way to get it to change.

26:54.280 --> 26:54.960
I don't disagree.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.160
Going back to chat with more comments.

26:58.160 --> 27:02.480
I can't see in chat says as a new Xbox gamer, I want it to go through.

27:02.720 --> 27:06.000
But I also don't want gaming to be like the movie and TV industry.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.680
I don't like having content locked behind subscriptions, subscriptions add up.

27:10.680 --> 27:18.920
And that's maybe a reference towards what I'm assuming is Xbox Game Pass and how a lot of stuff is being invested in that.

27:19.160 --> 27:24.440
And we kind of see the whole like Netflix of gaming type of contest going on there.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.680
So I get that.

27:27.480 --> 27:31.960
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, Overwatch is still a seller in terms of the esports aspect.

27:32.280 --> 27:35.040
The game still does well on the streamed tournament circuit.

27:35.080 --> 27:38.120
Oh, maybe. Maybe Microsoft wants Overwatch League.

27:39.520 --> 27:40.840
That could very well be possible.

27:40.840 --> 27:41.160
I don't know.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.600
Blizzard doesn't want Overwatch League, so I mean.

27:45.880 --> 27:52.360
But I can understand where maybe if you have that infrastructure that Overwatch League has set up,

27:52.680 --> 27:57.800
maybe Microsoft can leverage that into getting more eyes on something like, I don't know, Halo Reach.

27:57.800 --> 28:09.000
I'm reaching admittedly, but, you know, something that, you know, gets the other Microsoft competitive games that they would like to have at that same level.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.120
I don't know.

28:10.120 --> 28:15.160
I acknowledge I'm reaching a little bit, but, you know, who knows?

28:15.760 --> 28:18.120
Only Microsoft knows for sure what their motivations are.

28:19.200 --> 28:19.680
All right.

28:19.880 --> 28:25.560
Well, let's talk about our motivations and the types of games that we have been playing this week in a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week?

28:25.560 --> 28:27.000
And we will start with DarkSakura.

28:27.000 --> 28:27.840
How was your gaming week?

28:29.960 --> 28:31.360
It was it was all right.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.760
It was the usual stuff, Dead by Daylight.

28:35.920 --> 28:43.600
Lots of funny shenanigans, I've been playing a lot with Gwen and with one of my newer streamer buddies, Raven McPherse.

28:44.480 --> 28:45.320
Really fun.

28:46.320 --> 28:53.120
Um, I have been playing my stupid wordscapes game, like pretty hardcore lately.

28:54.160 --> 29:00.680
Um, I have been playing a lot of pinball, just, you know, the stuff we have in my house.

29:00.680 --> 29:06.480
I actually tried to play some Twilight Zone the other day and I forgot that it doesn't have a ball save.

29:06.960 --> 29:07.440
Oops.

29:08.440 --> 29:13.080
Um, and, uh, I played some Colds of the Lamb.

29:13.160 --> 29:17.000
I'm actually, I've actually beaten it and now I've gotten all of the tarot cards.

29:17.440 --> 29:21.960
So I'm trying to figure out what I have left to do in the game other than start a new play through.

29:22.640 --> 29:26.520
Um, and I'm on the third leg of Final Fantasy 5.

29:26.560 --> 29:29.080
We're just about to go to the Fork Tower.

29:29.760 --> 29:36.480
Um, and then after that's done, I was going to put it up between Star Ocean and Emerald Dragon.

29:36.800 --> 29:40.120
But if I played Emerald Dragon, I would want to play the PC Engine version.

29:40.120 --> 29:47.920
Um, so I'd have to set up the capture and then find a patch that I can run on, uh, run simultaneously with my, with my disc copy.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.360
Cause I do own an original Emerald Dragon.

29:50.360 --> 29:55.480
It's not a very expensive game, but I think Star Ocean would be a lot easier to do.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.320
So I'm probably going to be playing Star Ocean next.

29:58.960 --> 29:59.280
Nice.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.880
All right, we'll move on to Loki.

30:02.880 --> 30:07.200
I know we talked about the, uh, uh, convention you were at this weekend, but what else for your gaming week?

30:07.720 --> 30:10.800
It was pretty much just Jumpman and Minecraft.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.000
It was all Minecraft this week.

30:13.040 --> 30:18.240
Just, um, working on, uh, editing for different videos and stuff like that.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.720
I was gonna say, this was your big week off to produce.

30:20.720 --> 30:26.520
Yeah, you know, like it was, but it didn't, I don't feel as productive as I should have been.

30:26.600 --> 30:30.920
Um, even though like I wasn't wasting time, it just, it doesn't feel like I got a lot done.

30:31.320 --> 30:41.440
I was hoping to get multiple videos done, but I got a short out, which technically was done weeks ago, but, uh, I published that and that did okay.

30:41.520 --> 30:53.000
Um, but yeah, I needed to do more shorts because, um, that seemed to be, it's a really quick, like 3000 views and, um, I got like a few subs out of it too.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.680
So it's not bad.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.760
It's good for, um, getting noticed.

30:56.760 --> 31:04.120
And then, um, just, yeah, I've been working on, uh, the episode for the modded series, uh, which I'm almost done with.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.720
Hopefully I'll have that out either.

31:06.080 --> 31:06.960
It'll probably be tomorrow.

31:07.040 --> 31:14.040
And then, um, I still be, I don't even know I'm going to work on for the SMB stuff for channel 64.

31:15.600 --> 31:20.000
I mean, I know what I should work on, but I don't know if it's gonna, gonna happen.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.840
And I need to work on more of the, the mega base stuff.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.120
Um, but I also have vault hunters.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.120
I just started to that.

31:26.120 --> 31:30.400
Haven't filmed anything in yet, or at least I've, I've keep filming things and then deleting it.

31:30.400 --> 31:40.360
Cause I can't, uh, well, windows updates decide to, um, tweak on my audio and video settings, which is fun.

31:40.360 --> 31:46.800
So like I kept one, my audio was recording incredibly quiet to the point where I couldn't even hear it.

31:47.440 --> 31:54.080
Um, thanks to it, enabling some stupid program that I don't normally have launch anyways.

31:54.080 --> 32:00.680
It's like some thing that some companion program that came with my, uh, I mean, I guess it's an audio driver

32:00.680 --> 32:01.920
because we don't have sound cards anymore.

32:02.440 --> 32:11.160
Um, and then like OBS change settings where the, um, there was an audio delay, like a two second audio delay

32:11.160 --> 32:18.760
that was unfixable because windows 10, when it updated, switched my audio from 44 to 48.

32:19.240 --> 32:23.240
Um, and so it was annoying.

32:23.440 --> 32:29.480
So I finally figured that out and track that down, but it was getting to the point where like, I'd have to sync my

32:29.560 --> 32:36.000
mic audio and the video that sync the video and its own audio to get it to work right.

32:36.040 --> 32:39.960
And that takes, you know, multiply that times the number of clips I have in there.

32:40.360 --> 32:43.560
It just really compounds and adds a lot more time to everything.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.520
So now that it's all fixed, it should be more streamlined going forward.

32:46.520 --> 32:50.280
It's just, you know, figuring that out over the few days, um, took a while.

32:51.200 --> 32:56.880
Um, but yeah, I had fun this week and I mean, I'm going to have some more time throughout, you know,

32:56.880 --> 33:01.480
the next couple of weeks because, you know, we have the holidays, so 40 weekends and stuff like that.

33:01.520 --> 33:06.240
Um, so yeah, I should be able to work on a little bit more of that as well.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.960
Um, I'm hoping to get more into the groove in it.

33:08.960 --> 33:13.480
I know we've, um, got some exciting things around the corner with, you know, the SMPs.

33:13.480 --> 33:16.240
So, you know, new year will be fun too.

33:16.800 --> 33:21.600
Um, and then my Minecraft, I mean, Mojang has been super quiet about their updates.

33:21.600 --> 33:25.000
So, I mean, who knows when that's coming?

33:25.000 --> 33:29.520
So we may have tons of time left before we have to reset the server or something.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.800
You know, you were talking about, you were talking about YouTube shorts.

33:33.200 --> 33:36.320
Have you tried, uh, syndicating your content on TikTok as well?

33:36.760 --> 33:41.520
I know, I know, I'm just talk and, uh, Instagram stories and stuff like that.

33:41.520 --> 33:45.160
Taken me years to figure it out, but I finally got sucked into TikTok a little bit.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.880
And I will tell you that algorithm for discovering stuff.

33:47.920 --> 33:51.280
I, it, it's, it, it does it better than any other platform.

33:51.280 --> 33:51.920
Let me tell you.

33:52.200 --> 33:56.800
And I'm seeing stuff as I go through my feed, I see stuff with like zero likes and zero comments.

33:56.960 --> 34:00.920
So I know occasionally it pushes stuff that it thinks I'm going to like in there.

34:00.920 --> 34:04.920
And that's how these things are getting lots of views because people don't just watch one TikTok.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.600
They watch like 20 all at once.

34:06.600 --> 34:10.960
And so they'll see some that are from their usuals and then it sneaks some new ones in there.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.520
So it's, it's interesting.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.560
That whole TikTok space is very interesting to me.

34:14.880 --> 34:20.000
So I need to sit down like, and just knock out because I've set up a template with this first one.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.720
So it took a little bit longer to make the short.

34:21.760 --> 34:30.560
Um, but I have a template now set up where I should be able to just go back to my older videos and start with just like the, the build time lapses.

34:30.600 --> 34:35.520
And condense those down to a minute and then just upload those and schedule them out.

34:35.640 --> 34:43.160
And then, um, I'll have to go through some of the other stuff and find clips that I like, like funny things or something like that and do all that.

34:43.480 --> 34:48.680
Um, but yeah, like this first one was my first major build that was on my first S and P.

34:48.680 --> 34:51.440
So that's like over a year old now.

34:51.440 --> 34:52.600
It's like almost two years old.

34:52.680 --> 35:00.320
And so I'm starting there and kind of going more towards current, I mean, mix it up, I don't know, it might not be in order, but.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.440
But yeah, I got like really good engagement.

35:02.440 --> 35:08.280
Like, you know, um, I think we got eight subs in about 3,100 views in like a day.

35:08.320 --> 35:08.560
Yeah.

35:08.600 --> 35:11.800
And it's, it's really weird how the, like the algorithm works with it.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.520
It'll, it'll push it and it's gone.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.320
Like there's no engagement after that.

35:15.760 --> 35:19.000
So, but you know, you just do those every once in a while.

35:19.520 --> 35:22.680
Even eight new subs from a short is great.

35:22.680 --> 35:25.280
Like I, I'm excited as fuck.

35:25.280 --> 35:30.480
If I get two new follows on a Twitch stream, I'm sure Jamie's in a similar boat where it's like, you get two new

35:30.480 --> 35:32.240
followers, it's like, I had a great stream today.

35:32.880 --> 35:33.400
Well, yeah.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.400
And that's the thing.

35:34.400 --> 35:43.520
It's most frustrating about YouTube is like, I will put in like a month worth of effort for a video or something like that and see like almost nothing from it.

35:43.600 --> 35:50.840
And then I'll have one of my, um, you know, server partners, he'll start a hardcore series.

35:51.120 --> 35:58.360
Where he's basically just building and he gets 600 subs out of it and just an immense amount of watch time from just like a video.

35:58.760 --> 36:02.200
And it's not like, I'm like, I don't, I'm not jealous.

36:02.200 --> 36:08.520
I'm not, it's just like, it's, it's very frustrating because you don't know, like, you would say, okay, well, what is the algorithm looking for?

36:08.560 --> 36:11.320
Like, I will do that thing, but you don't know.

36:11.320 --> 36:12.320
And nobody knows.

36:12.320 --> 36:19.040
It's like, you just keep trying things and see what sticks, but I'm telling you what it's looking for is short content.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.200
That's going to be what gets you.

36:20.200 --> 36:28.080
I mean, I'm not saying specifically for the YouTube algorithm, but like short content and leveraging that to the places like YouTube shorts, TikTok.

36:28.120 --> 36:34.640
And that sort of thing that will, and honestly, we need to take our own fucking advice and put clips of this show on those platforms as well.

36:34.640 --> 36:38.040
You know, we haven't, technically we have a vog network TikTok.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.280
We just haven't used it yet.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.120
Keyword yet.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.640
Um, but it's there, you can go follow it.

36:42.920 --> 36:54.320
Um, but, uh, you know, I, I really think that's the secret because my opinion is when it comes to 20 minute YouTube videos, you're going to watch the things that you already know you like.

36:54.560 --> 36:59.520
When it comes to minute and a half shorts, you're more willing to sit there and watch random things that are put in front of you.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.520
Cause you're just binging them.

37:00.760 --> 37:04.560
I think that's a real key difference, but right anyway.

37:04.600 --> 37:09.360
But yeah, and, and, and it depends, like it just like the type type of content.

37:09.360 --> 37:16.520
Some people don't really want to watch us in peace right now, but then there's also some people that will watch the same thing over and over or the same person over and over.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.120
There's, there's something for everyone.

37:19.160 --> 37:19.840
There's nothing for everyone.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.000
Yeah.

37:20.000 --> 37:28.800
It's just, it's, it's all about tricking the algorithm to get it to the most impressions and you'll, it's just a percentage game at that point.

37:30.080 --> 37:30.440
All right.

37:30.480 --> 37:34.360
Uh, my gaming week, not, not terribly exciting compared to previous weeks.

37:34.360 --> 37:37.040
I, I still am on my Warcraft bullshit.

37:37.080 --> 37:42.080
I got to level 64, uh, on my orc priest, which by the way is a new combination.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.200
Orcs couldn't be priests before this expansion.

37:44.200 --> 37:48.800
So, or I should say my priestess, uh, cause I'm a lady orc, uh, named super Sprode.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.240
One of my favorite freeze pop songs there ever was.

37:51.280 --> 37:55.560
So, um, I actually, I recycled an old rogue or something just to steal the name.

37:55.920 --> 38:04.480
So, um, yeah, I, I've still been on that and that's been fun cause I've been in the new expansion areas, which are, it's, it's, it's weird cause they're very vertical.

38:04.480 --> 38:12.680
They're very flying, uh, based, which they came up with a new form of flying for this, the dragon, which is the name of the expansion dragon flight.

38:12.880 --> 38:13.640
So it's interesting.

38:13.640 --> 38:18.320
It took me a minute to warm up to it, but now that I've warmed up to it, I'm like, I kind of like it for being able to explore.

38:18.320 --> 38:23.920
I think it's a good medium between they don't want you to just fly around in the zone and finish all the quests instantly.

38:23.960 --> 38:30.480
And, uh, you know, have a sense of you're not wasting time walking everywhere.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.120
It's interesting.

38:31.720 --> 38:42.280
Um, other games I've been continuing on, uh, my, uh, AR gaming stuff, specifically Pokemon go had a two day community day this weekend and I had some shinies to catch up on.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.720
So I went pretty hard at least yesterday.

38:46.000 --> 38:52.400
I walked 10,000 steps today was harder because I knew I had OLR at six o'clock, so I couldn't stay out.

38:52.720 --> 38:55.320
Um, but I think I got like four or five shinies today.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.840
I got a lot more yesterday.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.000
I, I think I still don't have a shiny Litwick.

39:00.520 --> 39:04.800
I think that was, I couldn't do that community day for some reason.

39:04.800 --> 39:12.240
I still don't have a shiny Litwick, so I'm going to have to beg somebody else for one that got like 40 of them, but I think I filled in the other shinies I needed.

39:12.600 --> 39:19.160
Um, Starly, I remember was one, I think that was when I had COVID was Starly day and I was able to get a couple of those today.

39:19.160 --> 39:20.440
So I feel better about that now.

39:21.360 --> 39:26.320
Uh, and then I've also been playing Pikmin Bloom had some very controversial changes this week.

39:26.360 --> 39:33.640
I'm not going to go too into the weeds cause I know not a ton of people play Pikmin Bloom, but I've really enjoyed it as far as like a passive type of experience.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.960
They changed the mushroom combat system though.

39:36.960 --> 39:41.040
And they, they really did not make popular changes.

39:41.040 --> 39:47.200
I get what they were going for, but they made battles that used to take five minutes, take seven days.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.720
That's not an exaggeration, literally seven.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.400
It's a complete change to the system.

39:51.800 --> 39:59.200
I get why they were doing it because they were trying to encourage people to get to see each other actually battling together and stuff like that.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.680
But they went a little too hard to the extreme.

40:02.040 --> 40:11.640
On the plus side, the team heard the feedback within two days and cut down all the times by either 50% or 75%, depending on the level of mushroom.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.080
And I think it's much more reasonable now.

40:13.520 --> 40:17.560
Um, so I think, I think Pikmin Bloom's in an interesting place right now.

40:17.880 --> 40:23.760
Um, I'm, I'm still enjoying it, but I also think there's some nuances with the system they need to do.

40:23.760 --> 40:34.800
Like they need to have a way where you are required to drop a certain amount of Pikmin in there because it's too easy to exploit the system and just drop one Pikmin in there.

40:35.040 --> 40:38.560
And then, but you're also robbing yourself of leveling up Pikmin that way.

40:38.560 --> 40:38.920
I don't know.

40:38.920 --> 40:40.040
It's, it's just a weird thing.

40:40.400 --> 40:45.360
Uh, and then if five people are on a mushroom, that mushroom needs to phase out and a new one brought in.

40:45.360 --> 40:53.120
So five more people can jump on it because it's making play for the game in some places like Tokyo, I hear like impossible because people jump on a mushroom.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.600
And then nobody else could do it.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.640
So anyway, there's still some little nuances.

40:56.640 --> 41:01.960
I'm not going to go too deep in the weeds because I know not a lot of people play Pikmin Bloom, but, um, I, I do.

41:01.960 --> 41:11.080
And I, I still like it as a walking incentivizer and I'm still level 69, but I'm only like 15,000 steps away from level 70.

41:11.080 --> 41:13.960
So sadly, I won't get to say that too much longer.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.000
Um, what else have I played?

41:17.040 --> 41:18.920
Oh, I played an interesting thing today.

41:19.440 --> 41:22.600
Uh, cause I saw Alan playing it and I was like, oh, I forgot this is a thing.

41:22.600 --> 41:23.560
Oh, this is free.

41:23.560 --> 41:24.640
If I already own the game.

41:24.640 --> 41:25.280
Okay, cool.

41:25.280 --> 41:25.840
I'll do this.

41:26.120 --> 41:36.200
So I got portal for RTX, the new version of portal that they released with like the souped up graphics because I was like, I have a fancy new computer with a fancy new graphics card.

41:36.200 --> 41:36.800
Let me try this.

41:37.800 --> 41:51.160
It doesn't run great in 4k, but on Alan's machine he has, so Alan actually has a really nice monitor, but it only runs ultra HD or 2k, but it's a really like pretty finished.

41:51.160 --> 41:52.760
Like it has that slight curve to it.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.720
It's really bright.

41:53.880 --> 41:55.440
I've watched him play Fortnite on it.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.280
It looks really good.

41:56.280 --> 42:09.760
And I watched him play the portal RTX game and it looked pretty good, but, um, he got a much better frame rate than I did because mine's in 4k and it's, it's kind of ugly and his is in 2k and it runs pretty decently.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.960
So that was, but it was, it's really nice to look at.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.800
I played like the first couple of stages and I was like, okay, I didn't, it isn't worth it to have the nicer graphics.

42:19.800 --> 42:26.920
But is it, isn't it nice to feel like my very expensive investment is already outdated by that game?

42:27.160 --> 42:28.840
My very expensive investment.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.040
It's not just that game.

42:31.040 --> 42:37.200
It's a lot of games are ray tracing is still not optimized well enough for even like modern cards.

42:37.200 --> 42:41.960
Like even like on a 40 90, I think with that game, it doesn't run great.

42:42.520 --> 42:43.440
It's just the game.

42:44.320 --> 42:44.680
Fair.

42:45.200 --> 42:47.240
So, and a lot of games, it's a lot of games.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.960
It seems like ray tracing was just not worth it.

42:49.080 --> 42:49.360
Yeah.

42:50.280 --> 42:50.840
It's not.

42:51.520 --> 42:54.600
Um, the only other thing I touched this week was Tetris effect connected.

42:55.360 --> 42:58.760
Because I've been going into the Epic store every day to get the free game.

42:58.800 --> 43:03.440
Cause you know, they started their, whatever, 15 days of holiday downloads, whatever it is.

43:03.760 --> 43:06.640
Cause they, they had horizon chase turbo yesterday, which is a pretty good one.

43:06.960 --> 43:18.280
Um, and usually the December 25th one, I think, and the, um, very last one are usually like they gave away the entire Tomb Raider trilogy last year, if I remember right.

43:18.320 --> 43:22.360
So I'm hoping there'll be a big one that I don't have yet that they'll give away.

43:22.640 --> 43:29.520
Um, but I was bringing up the Epic store and I was like, Oh, I don't think I've played Tetris effect since I got this newer computer and the 4k monitor and everything.

43:29.880 --> 43:30.840
It was very pretty.

43:30.920 --> 43:31.920
I was, I was very happy.

43:31.920 --> 43:32.600
I fired that up.

43:32.600 --> 43:35.400
I was like, Oh, this is, this is nice comfort food.

43:35.440 --> 43:37.760
As far as game goes, I love some Tetris effect.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.240
I, I really hope there's another one.

43:40.480 --> 43:45.440
We haven't really heard about what, um, Mizuguchi is working on now.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.080
Have we?

43:46.760 --> 43:50.080
So he's kind of, I would assume he's working on another Tetris effect game.

43:50.080 --> 43:52.680
Like the last one was huge, but I don't know.

43:52.680 --> 43:54.920
I guess nothing's for sure in that department.

43:54.920 --> 43:55.400
Who knows?

43:55.800 --> 43:57.040
So, all right.

43:57.640 --> 43:59.760
Otherwise that was pretty much my gaming week.

44:00.160 --> 44:04.040
So we will move on and let's get into some news from the week.

44:04.080 --> 44:06.160
Loki, what's going on in video game news.

44:06.840 --> 44:07.960
You must finally do it.

44:08.120 --> 44:11.120
He's going to make a movie about death Stranding.

44:11.720 --> 44:14.560
And it's going to have a different story, which is interesting.

44:14.560 --> 44:18.480
It's going to be set around a different set of characters, but still in the same universe.

44:18.880 --> 44:22.400
And that's good because I don't understand what the hell's going on in Death Stranding.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.560
So it'll be, it'll be nice when they dumb it down.

44:25.640 --> 44:28.400
You actually have to play the game to understand a little bit, at least.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.240
I mean, that is true that that would probably help.

44:31.240 --> 44:31.720
It would help.

44:32.920 --> 44:38.000
But yes, so he's finally going to be working on a movie in partnership

44:38.000 --> 44:41.760
with Kajima Productions and barbarian executive producer,

44:42.160 --> 44:47.440
Alex Leibovitchis, Hammerstone Studios.

44:49.240 --> 44:51.280
Didn't really go into much detail there.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.280
Then it's going to have new elements and characters.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.400
Basically saying we're thrilled and honored to have an opportunity

44:56.400 --> 45:01.080
to partner with the brilliant and iconic Hideo Kojima in his first film adaptation.

45:01.080 --> 45:04.000
Unlike other big budget tentpole video game adaptions,

45:04.320 --> 45:07.280
this will be something far more intimate and grounded.

45:07.280 --> 45:10.640
Our I'm sorry, the game is not grounded at all.

45:11.240 --> 45:15.560
Our goal is to redefine what video game adaptations could be

45:16.240 --> 45:18.080
when you have the creative and artistic freedom.

45:18.080 --> 45:20.960
This will be a film that's authentic Hideo Kojima production.

45:20.960 --> 45:22.160
It's going to be insane.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.240
He's not going to be able to make a two and a half hour movie.

45:24.240 --> 45:25.880
He's not. He's he's not.

45:25.880 --> 45:28.400
It's going to be like, oh, we had to split it into two movies.

45:28.840 --> 45:31.280
Like, there's no way. No way.

45:32.680 --> 45:33.800
I will go see it.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.240
It's going to because it's going to be crazy.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.640
Zen Monkey Eleven says, give me the release date of that movie

45:38.640 --> 45:40.760
so I can plan to do something else that weekend.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.520
Well, who's to say it's going to be in theaters?

45:42.520 --> 45:46.600
I mean, I I honestly think the movie is going to be so long.

45:46.600 --> 45:50.880
He ends up doing Netflix, Hulu, HBO, whatever it is show.

45:51.840 --> 45:55.480
So I think it ends up becoming a series, to be quite honest.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.840
But we'll see. We'll see. Who knows?

45:57.840 --> 46:01.480
So Tiger on chat says they need to get Norman Reedus involved.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.160
Well, he's going to be in the sequel.

46:04.200 --> 46:07.720
So and I wonder if this doesn't tie into this because the sequel,

46:07.720 --> 46:10.480
I don't see how it can be.

46:10.480 --> 46:11.440
I mean, I don't know.

46:11.440 --> 46:14.000
There's a lot of weird places they could go with the sequel,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.680
but they're obviously putting Norman Reedus in it.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.400
So it's interesting.

46:19.440 --> 46:22.600
Yeah. Well, let's see, I guess. Yeah.

46:22.640 --> 46:25.560
Let's see. Fifth Dream says the movie will be generated in engine

46:25.560 --> 46:28.040
and cost seventy dollars to play on PlayStation five.

46:28.040 --> 46:30.920
I don't know if you can screen it at the cinema if it does that.

46:30.920 --> 46:33.800
Who knows? As Joan Hunter Matt says, yeah, he can't fit it

46:33.800 --> 46:35.080
in a two to three hour movie.

46:35.080 --> 46:37.960
I feel like a Death Stranding series would have been good on HBO Max.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.080
But let's be real.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.160
But WB Discovery isn't making that happen.

46:41.160 --> 46:43.160
No, that's that's true. How about Disney Plus?

46:44.800 --> 46:48.560
How about Death Stranding on Disney Plus?

46:48.560 --> 46:51.560
All right, let's move on.

46:52.120 --> 46:57.240
Let's talk about what I mentioned Tomb Raider during the epic game store

46:57.480 --> 47:01.960
giveaways and Tomb Raider is going to be continuing.

47:02.040 --> 47:05.040
You know, we haven't we haven't heard a lot out of the series in a little bit,

47:05.040 --> 47:08.400
and that's likely because they are going to start a new trilogy

47:08.400 --> 47:09.800
or do something new with it.

47:09.800 --> 47:13.000
But it has been confirmed that Crystal Dynamics is working on

47:13.000 --> 47:16.440
Lara Croft's biggest and most expansive adventure yet

47:17.000 --> 47:19.040
because it's being built in Unreal Engine five.

47:19.040 --> 47:20.880
Oh, that was something they had said before.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.440
They're making it in Unreal Engine five.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.720
I do remember that when they announced Unreal Engine.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.560
But now what we've learned is that Amazon is going to be publishing it.

47:29.080 --> 47:31.080
So Crystal Dynamics is developing.

47:31.120 --> 47:34.320
Amazon is publishing and Unreal Engine five is being used.

47:34.680 --> 47:38.880
It's still a few years out, but it is going to come to multiple platforms.

47:39.240 --> 47:43.080
Amazon does say it will have all of the franchise's hallmarks.

47:43.480 --> 47:47.400
So I'm assuming that means the elaborate death scenes

47:47.400 --> 47:50.280
that are a part of Lara Croft's no good, very bad day.

47:50.600 --> 47:55.240
I'm assuming we're going to still see some of that in the game. We'll see.

47:56.760 --> 47:59.000
It's it's not going to be a remake either.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.720
So it's continuing Laura's story as well.

48:01.720 --> 48:03.200
It's not a new reboot.

48:03.200 --> 48:08.120
So I guess it's not really a new trilogy, but maybe a continuation trilogy.

48:08.120 --> 48:11.520
I guess I guess it's the Scream four or the Scream five,

48:11.520 --> 48:16.280
even of the Lara Croft Tomb Raider recent games. I don't know.

48:17.280 --> 48:19.920
But anyway, even though Embracer

48:19.920 --> 48:22.720
got the intellectual property rights to Tomb Raider and so forth,

48:23.200 --> 48:27.520
this is just, you know, Crystal Dynamics has made the agreement with Amazon

48:27.520 --> 48:31.240
for this. In a statement, the head of the studio, Scott Amos, said,

48:31.480 --> 48:34.560
Crystal Dynamics has an extraordinary opportunity following our acquisition

48:34.560 --> 48:37.760
by Embracer to redefine what a publishing relationship is for Tomb Raider.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.720
Transformative is what we're looking for.

48:39.720 --> 48:42.880
And with Amazon Games, we found a team that shares our creative vision,

48:43.200 --> 48:46.560
ambitions and values for a Lara Croft universe across the spectrum

48:46.560 --> 48:47.720
of possibilities.

48:47.720 --> 48:50.720
They're uniquely positioned to rewrite what publishing and development

48:50.720 --> 48:54.440
collaborations are, and we're eager to forge this new path together,

48:54.600 --> 48:58.320
starting with building the biggest and best Tomb Raider game yet.

48:59.480 --> 49:01.560
And of course, we know that's all the fluff speak.

49:01.880 --> 49:04.880
We need to see what the game really looks like to be convinced.

49:05.160 --> 49:06.920
Although, you know,

49:06.920 --> 49:10.320
Amazon's got a cloud service that you probably forgot about.

49:10.440 --> 49:12.520
They have their Luna services out there.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.040
Wouldn't it be a smart thing for them to do if they were to put like the demo?

49:17.040 --> 49:18.800
I'm not saying they have to release the game on Luna.

49:18.800 --> 49:20.120
I mean, they should.

49:20.120 --> 49:22.960
But even just put the demo.

49:23.440 --> 49:27.760
If you want people just just to check out Luna, put the first demo

49:27.960 --> 49:31.400
on the cloud service for just like a couple of days before you put on PS

49:31.400 --> 49:32.600
fires, I'm telling you,

49:32.600 --> 49:35.840
people will check out Luna just to fire up that demo and play it.

49:35.840 --> 49:38.160
I think I think that would be a smart idea.

49:38.160 --> 49:39.840
But I've also said on a previous episode,

49:39.840 --> 49:42.720
I believe Amazon to be an extremely siloed company right now.

49:42.720 --> 49:44.160
So I'm not expecting it to happen.

49:44.160 --> 49:47.160
It's just, you know, what I what I need them to get dead by daylight.

49:47.720 --> 49:49.560
Oh, yes, right. Luna doesn't have that, huh?

49:49.560 --> 49:50.960
So that was so that way.

49:50.960 --> 49:52.520
I won't have to use.

49:52.520 --> 49:56.000
I mean, this story is great, just not the most stable of connections.

49:57.320 --> 50:01.040
Yeah. And, you know, you would think that Amazon has a good relationship

50:01.040 --> 50:04.840
with behavior because you see all the giveaways and Amazon Prime gaming

50:04.840 --> 50:06.200
or whatever it's called,

50:06.200 --> 50:09.320
which, again, why that is completely separate from Luna.

50:09.320 --> 50:11.160
I don't understand.

50:11.160 --> 50:12.840
But Amazon is siloed clearly.

50:12.840 --> 50:14.480
So it's just weird.

50:14.480 --> 50:16.840
So anyway.

50:17.560 --> 50:20.360
Fifth Dream in chat says, is anything an Unreal Engine

50:20.360 --> 50:22.440
five besides homebrew demos?

50:22.720 --> 50:23.880
Give it a little more time.

50:23.880 --> 50:26.520
You know, it takes a couple of years to make a triple A game.

50:26.680 --> 50:29.760
And that's why you're seeing the small stuffs coming out relatively fast.

50:29.760 --> 50:31.360
The things don't need a couple of years,

50:31.360 --> 50:33.560
but it's going to take a couple of years in the oven

50:33.560 --> 50:35.640
until you start seeing the fruits of this.

50:35.640 --> 50:37.320
You know, things like Tomb Raider and so forth.

50:37.320 --> 50:39.360
And I'm going to guess.

50:40.760 --> 50:43.720
They're going to need to be able to get away from the Xbox S.

50:44.680 --> 50:47.840
To do this, I think the Xbox S and let's be real, the PlayStation

50:47.840 --> 50:51.120
four are also kind of holding because right now

50:52.080 --> 50:56.600
most games still release on like PlayStation four.

50:56.600 --> 51:00.200
And pretty much Microsoft has a mandate that everything that they release on

51:00.200 --> 51:02.080
X has to release on S.

51:02.080 --> 51:05.280
And I think there's going to come a time when that gets separated,

51:05.280 --> 51:09.840
probably whenever Microsoft releases a Y or a Z or whatever they call it.

51:09.840 --> 51:10.440
I don't know.

51:10.440 --> 51:14.360
But they're probably going to stop supporting the S in the same way

51:14.360 --> 51:15.280
at that point.

51:15.320 --> 51:18.000
Now, for those of you that own an S,

51:18.000 --> 51:21.920
I don't think you'll be screwed because enter Microsoft's

51:21.920 --> 51:25.640
cloud will absolutely be functional on the S.

51:25.640 --> 51:28.600
And that's how they'll continue to let you play a lot of those games.

51:28.600 --> 51:30.560
That's you know, they haven't said anything.

51:30.560 --> 51:32.440
That's just, you know.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.400
Fortune teller Rob here,

51:34.400 --> 51:37.000
but I don't see how they don't do that for the future.

51:37.520 --> 51:38.520
We'll see.

51:38.520 --> 51:41.240
Dartesuya also points out they had the Matrix Universe demo.

51:41.240 --> 51:44.520
Yeah, that was the big showy offy thing for Unreal Engine five, for sure.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.440
Dijirama says, I legit think that Microsoft could update the firmware

51:48.440 --> 51:51.040
to handle 4K on the Xbox Series S.

51:51.640 --> 51:54.360
Maybe, but is it going to run like Portal RTX?

51:54.960 --> 51:56.720
Because then maybe don't.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.280
Maybe don't.

51:58.880 --> 52:00.840
But maybe give people the option.

52:00.840 --> 52:02.360
They have the option on a PC game.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.240
Give people the option.

52:04.240 --> 52:06.360
No, I like that idea.

52:06.360 --> 52:09.320
All right, moving on, Dark Sakura.

52:09.320 --> 52:13.360
So I'm sure anyone who's been following

52:13.760 --> 52:16.560
what I've been playing recently knows I've been playing Final Fantasy five

52:16.560 --> 52:18.920
and I am not playing the Pixel remasters.

52:18.920 --> 52:22.240
But certainly a good number of my friends have been playing the Pixel remasters.

52:22.240 --> 52:26.880
Like I know Le Pen was playing through the Final Fantasy games.

52:27.280 --> 52:31.160
And there will be a limited standard

52:31.160 --> 52:35.560
and then a 35th anniversary special edition

52:36.680 --> 52:40.600
Final Fantasy Pixel remaster, which is one through six.

52:41.160 --> 52:44.480
And the anniversary edition actually looks pretty stellar.

52:44.480 --> 52:47.840
It's coming to PS4 and Switch in 2023.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.400
This comes with a bunch of shit. It's awesome. I kind of want it.

52:54.040 --> 52:57.640
It is going to be for the standard is $74.99

52:57.880 --> 53:00.680
and that's a Squenix store exclusive.

53:01.120 --> 53:07.160
And then the the big anniversary bundle, also an exclusive, is $259.99.

53:07.560 --> 53:12.160
Now, the standard comes with the one through six Pixel remaster collection,

53:12.160 --> 53:16.560
which is a physical copy of all the games for PS4 or Switch.

53:17.040 --> 53:22.160
And then the the really super deluxe, awesome version

53:23.000 --> 53:27.160
has the physical copies again, anniversary edition, a goodie box,

53:28.200 --> 53:31.360
a bonus lenticular sleeve for the game package,

53:32.200 --> 53:36.520
a two disc vinyl record set with arranged game music

53:36.520 --> 53:40.600
and the cover artwork done by Shibuya Kazuko.

53:45.320 --> 53:48.120
Compiled art books showing the pixel art

53:49.000 --> 53:54.880
and then eight pixel art style characters in window packaging.

53:57.520 --> 54:01.200
It's looking pretty, pretty hardcore epic.

54:01.800 --> 54:04.360
That's a lot of a lot of good stuff that comes with that.

54:04.800 --> 54:08.000
Um, the pins are also like super cute.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.840
You've got like your your white mage and your black mage

54:11.840 --> 54:14.200
and you've got some characters from the other games.

54:14.200 --> 54:16.120
You got your fighter and all of that.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.280
And it's looking it's looking pretty nice.

54:18.600 --> 54:21.000
I think I could I think it's already gone.

54:21.320 --> 54:22.880
I think that is it.

54:22.880 --> 54:26.360
Yeah, because I know the pre-order the sorry, the orders just started.

54:26.360 --> 54:28.880
Yeah, no, Shane is complaining in chat.

54:29.120 --> 54:32.160
Shadley Lin's in our chat saying, putting the physical copies

54:32.160 --> 54:34.760
up in the middle of the night, charging twenty five bucks for shipping

54:34.760 --> 54:38.240
and making them only available through their online store is just garbage.

54:38.280 --> 54:42.040
Screw Square Enix for how they're handling the pixel remasters for consoles.

54:42.400 --> 54:46.840
So and Dark Tetsuya says, I'm seriously hoping for individual digital releases.

54:46.840 --> 54:49.520
I hope it's not exclusive to this limited physical edition.

54:49.520 --> 54:53.280
Oh, I don't square would literally be leaving money on the table.

54:53.280 --> 54:55.560
They have to have a digital option somewhere.

54:55.560 --> 54:58.920
I would be I would be flabbergasted.

54:59.800 --> 55:00.960
You're not buying it?

55:01.000 --> 55:02.240
No, I have the original.

55:02.240 --> 55:04.840
Why would I want the remasters?

55:05.960 --> 55:07.360
They're cute, I don't know.

55:07.360 --> 55:09.520
I understand they're a little pricey.

55:09.520 --> 55:12.760
I don't think I would pay this high ticket price for all the collectors stuff

55:12.760 --> 55:15.240
for them, but I enjoyed the four remaster.

55:15.480 --> 55:20.680
I have so many copies of four on different items.

55:21.120 --> 55:25.280
And then I have like the PlayStation collection

55:25.280 --> 55:27.360
and I have the cartridges for everything,

55:28.360 --> 55:32.080
not to mention, you know, other ways of playing them.

55:32.080 --> 55:37.800
I don't see the pixel remasters would be like if someone had no access

55:37.800 --> 55:40.680
to the original cartridges and wanted to play something

55:40.680 --> 55:42.800
that looks kind of like the original did.

55:43.240 --> 55:46.000
Also, the high risk pixels kind of freak me out.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.760
I need I need them to be old school.

55:49.160 --> 55:50.440
I need my old pixels.

55:50.440 --> 55:53.280
I will say this, especially if they do piecemeal them.

55:53.280 --> 55:54.640
I think you could make a case.

55:54.640 --> 55:56.600
Well, there's no right or wrong answer.

55:56.600 --> 55:58.400
Every gamer makes their own choice of their purchases.

55:58.400 --> 56:03.200
But I think there could be a stronger case for specifically Final Fantasy three.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.840
And Jason kind of referenced in the intro there tonight

56:05.840 --> 56:09.480
that technically Final Fantasy three has never been released in the U.S.

56:09.880 --> 56:11.800
in two dimensions.

56:11.800 --> 56:14.120
The very first time we got Final Fantasy three was that

56:15.920 --> 56:17.600
3D DS.

56:17.600 --> 56:20.960
Well, there was the it was DS first, and then the iOS version came after that.

56:20.960 --> 56:23.920
And so we've only ever really had it in its 3D form.

56:24.240 --> 56:26.320
It was even on the Ouya in the 3D form.

56:26.320 --> 56:28.840
Remember that that was a big deal because Square Enix put something on the Ouya.

56:29.120 --> 56:30.040
It was Final Fantasy three.

56:30.040 --> 56:32.800
So this is the first time we've had it in two dimensions.

56:33.080 --> 56:36.240
And that means the first time with an official English translation.

56:36.240 --> 56:37.600
Anyway, in two dimensions.

56:37.600 --> 56:42.200
So I would say that one in particular, I think has the strongest case going for it.

56:42.200 --> 56:46.320
Because I if you don't really care for the 3D ones, I don't I

56:46.920 --> 56:48.760
I don't know. I could kind of give or take them.

56:48.760 --> 56:52.040
I understand the perks for Final Fantasy four in the 3D.

56:52.040 --> 56:53.600
And some people were really into it.

56:53.600 --> 56:57.640
I still think the best version of Final Fantasy four was the one they did on the PSP.

56:57.960 --> 56:59.480
Was it the PS Vita?

56:59.480 --> 57:01.960
It was what it was the PSP.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.480
The best one is the original.

57:03.480 --> 57:06.320
Yeah, that's everyone's entitled to their opinion.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.720
But I love the one on the PSP.

57:08.720 --> 57:10.840
So if you ones are good.

57:10.840 --> 57:15.240
But I guess but I also understand the originals absolutely have their charm,

57:15.600 --> 57:19.600
especially, you know, when you compare the Japanese original original

57:19.600 --> 57:22.760
to what they actually released in the US, which was, you know,

57:22.760 --> 57:25.200
Final Fantasy, easy mode,

57:25.200 --> 57:28.400
which is all I ever knew for years through the Japanese one.

57:28.480 --> 57:32.000
Yeah. Yeah. When I did my thing, just it was a translated

57:33.160 --> 57:35.280
Japanese rom.

57:35.280 --> 57:38.320
And it had like all the censorship fixed and everything.

57:38.320 --> 57:41.560
And the original dialogue is closely translated as possible.

57:41.920 --> 57:45.760
Like the spoonie Bard line was more like you son of a bitch.

57:46.520 --> 57:49.840
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it was a lot harsher.

57:50.520 --> 57:54.400
Um, as to show 100, Matt says there's a rumor they're going to fix the font

57:54.400 --> 57:56.280
in these versions for Switch and PS4.

57:56.280 --> 58:00.280
That is the by far and wide, the biggest problem with the pixel remasters

58:00.280 --> 58:02.520
is the font sucks.

58:02.520 --> 58:05.040
It's going to especially suck on a large TV

58:05.040 --> 58:06.640
if you're sitting on the in the back of the room.

58:06.640 --> 58:09.800
So I do hope that is true, that they're looking at redoing those fonts.

58:09.800 --> 58:12.000
I really I really hope that's more than just a rumor.

58:12.160 --> 58:14.840
But that's probably at the top of people's wish list there.

58:15.040 --> 58:17.160
And going into chat for some other comments.

58:17.440 --> 58:20.800
Shadley Lynn Shane says the regular edition is gone.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.040
The collector's edition is still up for like 260 before shipping.

58:25.080 --> 58:27.160
Yeah, no, I'm not paying that.

58:27.160 --> 58:28.800
That's what I said.

58:28.800 --> 58:30.560
No, I just I'm not.

58:30.560 --> 58:33.040
It's too much, too much.

58:33.040 --> 58:36.360
But I mean, it's a lot of cool crap, but it's yeah, I don't need it.

58:38.800 --> 58:42.400
Shadley Lynn also says, I just want a physical cart for the switch for them.

58:42.400 --> 58:44.440
And that's true, and Matt says same.

58:44.440 --> 58:46.920
I think I might get the PlayStation version. I don't know.

58:46.920 --> 58:48.760
I kind of I kind of love trophies.

58:48.760 --> 58:51.720
I don't know. I just I that's kind of what I want.

58:51.720 --> 58:54.040
I don't. But I also don't do a lot of portable gaming.

58:54.040 --> 58:57.520
And I know some of you all do a lot more gaming on the go.

58:57.520 --> 59:00.720
Even the switch stuff I end up playing on my monitor or my TV.

59:00.720 --> 59:03.200
So it's, you know, whatever.

59:03.200 --> 59:05.280
But I'm glad they're finally coming.

59:05.280 --> 59:07.200
It took them long enough to announce this.

59:07.200 --> 59:09.600
I really would have thought this would have been like a year ago.

59:09.600 --> 59:11.720
So it's about time, I guess.

59:12.640 --> 59:14.640
All right. Moving on, Loki.

59:15.640 --> 59:20.440
All right, well, Epic is shutting down some older game servers

59:20.440 --> 59:23.240
for games you may recognize.

59:23.240 --> 59:26.800
Many, unfortunately, happen to be harmonics games.

59:27.280 --> 59:31.840
So we have that central one, two and three

59:33.040 --> 59:38.080
are all being shut down as well as numerous rock band games.

59:38.080 --> 59:41.320
So we have Green Day, rock band, rock band one, two and three.

59:42.200 --> 59:45.400
The Beatles rock band all being shut down.

59:45.400 --> 59:49.880
And then, of course, with unreal gold, unreal to the awakening,

59:49.880 --> 59:53.800
unreal tournament 2003, 2004 and unreal tournament three

59:54.320 --> 59:58.040
and unreal tournament game of the year edition as well.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.480
And then there's some other random ones there and their supersonic

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.560
acrobatic rocket powered battle cars.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.000
Great name. Monsters probably stole my princess

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.080
as well being shut down and 1000 tiny claws.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.840
Those are all being shut down, though.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.880
January 24th of 2023.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.800
So play online while you can.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:21.880
Rock band four is going to still be online, though.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.400
And the dance central VR

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.320
online multiplayer will remain available for now.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.800
I didn't even know that dance central VR was a thing.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.840
I did not either.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.080
Now to be on like it's it's sad to hear that these are going offline.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.680
But to be honest, I kind of assume they already were like.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.280
I thought they had the servers for Rock Band two and three,

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.440
like not long after four is released.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.320
So I was like, oh, they're even still up and running.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.960
That's cool. But yeah, it's still it's still hits

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.120
in the end of the end of an era type of way, I suppose.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.600
Yeah. And there are a few more things, too.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:03.000
So also, apparently players are going to lose access

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.120
to the following titles on their removal dates as well.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.600
Battle Breakers is going to be removed December 30th,

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.680
and they're going to refund players for any in-game purchases

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.360
made via epic direct payments 108 days prior to today.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.080
Unreal Tournament Alpha is being shut down January 24th.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:27.360
Rock Band Blitz on January 24th and the Rock Band companion app.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.280
Also January 24th in sync space on January 24th.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.480
Man, I wish Rock Band Blitz would come back.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.680
Such a good game. It's a bummer.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.600
Um, let's see.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.240
S200 Matt says keeping the servers going for 20 years

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.640
on some of those unreal games is pretty generous, to be honest.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.520
I'm kind of bummed and also surprised.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.920
Unreal Tournament 2004.

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.240
That was my big multiplayer game in my college years.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.280
What I'm surprised most about is that the servers were still running.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.440
Yeah, this is kind of kind of.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.240
Yeah. Oh, and they also this was probably impacts Jamie a little more,

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.640
but they apparently have removed the Mac

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.440
and Linux versions

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.600
of Hot Tofo Boyfriend and Hot Tofo Boyfriend Holiday Star.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.040
I wonder why. That's weird.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.280
No idea. They're old-ass games.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.360
It's already, um,

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.960
compatibility for the first one for Mac and iOS have already been removed.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.440
But I think they're still on Steam, though.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.320
I think this is like epic, epic direct or something like that.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.880
So maybe. Interesting. They are.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.120
Speaking of harmonics, a reminder.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.000
We kind of mentioned it in the parody bump, but that isn't on the podcast.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.720
And I don't know, it might be too late by the time the podcast is out.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.320
But reminder, Fusor's gone tomorrow, December 19th, which is Monday.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.720
So and I don't know what time of day it gets pulled.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.560
So it is I noticed it was 1999 on Steam.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:51.000
And if you do own Fusor and you haven't done it yet

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.400
and you're listening live, do it now, because you'll forget otherwise.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.560
Open the game and get the packs in the game that are like it's

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.960
it's the unlock everything for free.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:05.760
So it unlocks every I don't think it unlocks the DLC songs, unfortunately.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.520
But I think as far as like cosmetics, outfits, things like that,

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.480
somebody in chat can correct me if I'm wrong, but I was seeing

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.080
that was going around is that they have like a everything pack that's free.

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.760
And I think as far as, you know, again, like in in-game items

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.160
and that sort of thing, that's what they're giving away for free.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.160
And you will not be able to access it after tomorrow because the store will be gone.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:30.360
So just a reminder on that front, for those of you that own the game Fusor,

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.600
even if you think you'll never play it again, grab them just in case.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.400
I think it's a good idea.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.880
So, yeah, Zen Monkey 11 in chat says,

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.080
This is why I don't like to buy games with an online expiration date.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.040
The refund thing is a great idea.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.320
Well, the only the only time I think we've seen refunds is Stadia.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.960
And Dark Soccer can attest to that.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.080
And I think that's a that's a rarity.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.360
Be honest, is a nice little rarity there.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.320
It farted rainbows all over my bank account. Mm hmm.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:05.160
Shane says it unlocks the the Fusor unlocks the diamond stuff,

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.640
which was on a rotation, I believe weekly.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:11.040
It does include songs, but they are harmonics artist songs.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.800
So, yeah, there's a there's a variety of free DLC

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.240
also in Steam, which I'm imagining is the same stuff.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:22.280
So, yeah, I would grab everything you can before tomorrow's the end of Fusor.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.840
So those that enjoyed that.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.160
All right, let's move on and talk about this next story,

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.640
which has to do with Armored Core six,

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.760
which turned a lot of heads when it was announced at the Game Awards.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:38.320
Armored Core six will have versus multiplayer.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.400
I don't know if you're excited about that, Loki, but I know you're a fan of Max.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.920
And yeah, well, and I'm excited about this and what what it you know,

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:52.240
what it won't have is souls like gameplay that is being confirmed as well.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.520
So it's, you know, a different series,

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.680
even though from software is no one of the stuff, though, I think.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.200
I don't know about that.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.600
But anyway, IGN had an interview with Yamamura,

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.880
who is the I believe the executive producer of the game.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.640
He's saying, yes, we do plan to have a versus mode similar to previous

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.000
armed core titles where you'll be able to customize your mech

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.000
and take that fully customized mech into battle with others.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.520
But we will reveal more details about this at a later date.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.800
But also being said, story mode is the priority for this

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.400
versus is going to be a separate thing.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.760
Multiplayer will not be part of the story.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.840
So even though in armor, excuse me, armored core five,

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.960
there were more multiplayer options, such as teams of 20

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.400
facing off to defend and take territory.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.360
So we'll see what comes of that.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.560
Twenty twenty three is the anticipated release of armored core six fires

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.960
of Rubicon, PS4, PS5, Xbox series

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.320
and Xbox one even and PC via steam.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.240
The last release was 2012 was armored cord five.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.440
So it's been some time if you weren't aware for these games.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.800
All right, let's move on.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.120
I think we're to Dark Sakura.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.880
Believe that we are.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.320
And this is

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.600
I think a long time coming.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.000
Well, by a long time, I mean things that people have really pushed for.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.640
Twitch had basically added in a bunch of charities

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.520
that were based off of items

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.480
approved by PayPal Giving Fund.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:41.720
And among them was one called the LGB Alliance, which for

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:46.280
for all even what its name implies, it is actually an anti trans

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.480
hate group.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:54.280
And so with a lot of push from other Twitch users and a big

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:59.480
just upvote on one of their remove hate group

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:03.400
forum posts that received over 16000 upvotes,

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.800
Twitch said that they removed it and they're quoted with this.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:12.000
Twitch does not allow charities that violate our hateful conduct policies

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.040
on Twitch, whose organization and leadership engage

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:21.320
in or promote behaviors that violate our office service policy.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.760
Inclusion on this list is not an endorsement from Twitch.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.320
Also, it says, however, we regularly review the list

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.680
and remove organizations that violate our policies.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:38.480
There are still a few over there,

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.600
and it's pretty clear there's not like a true vetting process for any of these.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.920
I think it's just a mass approval, again, based on whatever

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.160
PayPal Giving approves.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.920
But at the very least, it's it's a response.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.680
Maybe they'll they'll take it to heart more for the future.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.320
Yeah. And if I believe correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:03.680
LGB Alliance is more based in the UK as well.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:07.000
I only heard of it when I was on Twitter and I'm not there anymore.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.360
But I also know that Lady Voldemort probably was involved with that somehow,

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.800
because you know how she is, unfortunately.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.040
And it's just it's obviously like as somebody who is G,

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.360
it's just really gross that you would not support RT,

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.320
you know, brothers and sisters and siblings, because like it's

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.600
we're all in it together.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.320
And it's just I do not understand that mentality whatsoever.

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.480
And it's really gross.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:31.480
Well, divided will fall. Yeah, right.

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.480
It's really gross with the organization pushes.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:37.520
So it's just, you know, I used to see some of that crap on Twitter

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:41.360
just because, you know, usually it was, quote, tweets of people dragging them

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.040
and the other things like that, which, you know, you're still amplifying it.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:44.920
So I wish you wouldn't do that.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.240
But, you know, it's

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.320
I just hope nobody I know would be involved with something like that,

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.720
because we're we're, you know, trans men are men and trans women are women.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.800
And we're all in this together.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.440
And it's just, yeah, it's and and being

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:04.200
non-binary is a true thing, of course. Yeah.

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:08.560
So, yeah, you you are who you are, be your true self.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:13.120
And if anybody says that that you're not valid, kick him in the shin really hard.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.840
Agree. All right.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.680
I don't normally advocate for violence, but you see how that feels.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.080
That's how I feel emotionally.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.480
So shut the fuck up, sit down and drink your goddamn tea.

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.280
You know what? I bet Argentina kicked a lot of shins today.

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.280
So you know what?

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.760
It is what it is. All right.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:35.240
Moving on, let's get into it.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.320
And that was that was a soccer joke or a football joke for the rest of the world.

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:41.520
OK, I quoted Sid from Final Fantasy seven. All right.

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.880
Moving on. Where are we at?

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:49.360
Loki. So Guerrilla Games has confirmed that they are working on an online

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:53.880
adaptation or online project in the Horizon universe.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.120
It's being worked on.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.680
I guess they are advertising open positions

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:03.480
in their Amsterdam office.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:08.240
And yeah, it says we're looking for talented people for Horizon single player.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:12.200
Online project and external project teams.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.120
So no word on what that is yet, but

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.120
maybe another live service game.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.960
Yay. Oh, boy.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.680
We'll have to see, I guess.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.920
But it's there's there's something coming.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.240
I think you're right on the money. It's a live service game.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.000
They want they want something that can keep on giving in that regard.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.520
So I haven't, you know, wasn't good enough for Sony to purchase,

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.520
you know, Destiny. We got to have more destiny.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:48.120
Well, one series you can get more and more of.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.760
In fact, this series has been going a long time.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.440
I remember playing these games.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.440
I think these originated

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:57.040
their soccer may have to correct me here because it was a CD based system

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.160
and I didn't have it back in the day. I want to say it was on.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:04.800
Maybe Turbo, I don't remember, but it's Ease series.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:06.320
Oh, yeah. Ease.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.400
The Ease games were

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.680
also Super Nintendo.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.160
Yeah, I remember them on Super Nintendo,

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.440
but I don't think that's where it started.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.720
They started on a CD based system, didn't they?

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:20.720
I am. I'm pretty sure that PC and that, well,

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:26.240
the first Ease Books one and two came out on PC Engine.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.240
I have to I'll have to do a little bit of digging

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:33.680
because I think that first two came out individually on MSX.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.240
I'm going to say, yeah.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.120
I know it was done by Nihan Falcom.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.600
Yeah, S2100 Matt says PC Engine CD ROM in 1989 and Turbo Graphics CD.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.680
That's that sounds right.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.320
I think it was a Turbo Graphics thing here. So.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.160
Yeah, it was actually it was the PC 8801.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:55.720
OK, that was it.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.560
I remembered it was on one of the computer systems and I wanted to say

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.080
MSX, but no, it was the NEC PC 8801.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.640
Well, here we are all these years later, and the series is still going.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.040
By the way, I there are a lot of people that think this is called Wise

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.880
because it's capital Y, lowercase s.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.080
And so there's a lot of people that call this series wise.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.920
So it's easy. Yeah.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.760
Even even I know that pronunciation.

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.640
That's telling you something.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.960
It's been a gamey for a long time as a child.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.280
Yeah, no, I didn't know it when I was younger either.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.760
So it is what it is.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:32.200
So East or wise to our childhood self is still going.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:35.680
And East is up to come out, by the way, on MSX, too.

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.320
Just saying, that's why I was thinking of it.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.480
Yeah, they poured in a lot of those.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:45.400
But the first game in its original release didn't come out on PC Engine,

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:50.640
on what we know as the PC Engine until it was a compilation with one and two.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.040
Got it. Well, they're on their 10th game now.

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.280
And actually, the 10th game is East 10 or is X.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.640
Nordics was released on the PlayStation four in 2019.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:08.120
It was is announced, though, that it will be coming out for more platforms in 2023.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:11.440
This is in celebration of the 35th anniversary of the series.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:16.040
So it's going to be coming out for the I think the Nintendo Switch

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.800
will actually be getting that as well.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.840
The Nintendo Switch is also going to get E's memoir.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.280
The Oath in Felghana.

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.040
This is a deepened action RPG, and they're calling this a definitive edition.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.840
This was originally released for the PSP in 2010.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.320
So this is one that would be pretty hard to get your hands on in 2022,

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.720
but it will be coming out for the Switch.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.240
And this is this is considered one of the better games in the series.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:47.240
And they've also added voiceovers for the protagonist in the game,

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.840
who's going to be voiced by Yukikaji.

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.920
It will have a narration by Banju Ginja

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.680
and an even more dramatic story, thanks to the voiceovers.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.880
Also, refined versions of the illustrations

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.040
for the characters during the story have been created.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.240
The classic versions for PSP and PC will also be included.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.960
You can switch between refined and classic.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:14.600
Continuing on with that for the Switch, apparently the same is also true

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.880
of the soundtrack, so you can actually flip back and forth.

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.640
So if you are, you know, you only want the classic version, you can do that.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.720
So that's pretty cool.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:27.920
So, yeah, a series you might have forgotten about,

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.160
but it's been a lot been around for a very long time.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.240
That's a series I got to catch up on sometime.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:35.240
I remember I had a lot of fun on Wanderers from Ys.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.800
Yeah, the fourth one.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.800
I remember playing one of them on Super Nintendo.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.720
I didn't particularly enjoy it at the time,

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.600
but my tastes have changed a lot as I got older.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.640
I would I'd be very curious to revisit it.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.000
Some want to say that the first one on Super Nintendo was Wanderers from Ys.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.120
It probably was. Yeah, I think it was these three. Yeah.

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.920
It had like some of my favorite music in it, though,

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.480
and I beat that game pretty hard.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.560
Well, while we're on the subject of classic games,

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.280
there's no better time than now for this.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:21.960
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:26.280
or I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.360
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.200
And what did you pick tonight, Dark Sakura?

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.320
Picked Final Fantasy X-2.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.800
And I had to make sure I hadn't done it yet, and I haven't.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:45.240
So and for the record, I picked the good version with the music by Kotakumi,

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.320
because honestly, I like her voice a hell of a lot better.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.840
And that and I actually still know the lyrics to all the songs,

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.120
and I've never bothered learning them in English.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.920
And also, you know, it's like with anything,

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.480
you always like the first version that you played,

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:06.400
and I imported this like right away.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:12.640
So Final Fantasy X-2 came out in 2003.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.760
It is a role playing video game.

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.000
It was developed by Square for PS2,

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.600
and it's actually one of the first examples

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:29.360
of a sequel to an in-universe Final Fantasy game,

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:32.640
as in typically in the past, they were all standalone.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.760
And this one was an actual sequel.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.880
So this one is Yuna looking for

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.320
Tidus, who was the hero from the game before,

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:51.200
and also fighting political hardship while looking for these spheres

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.880
that give them all kinds of magical girl transformation,

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:55.160
dress up powers for fun.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:02.240
And it's also the first one to have an all female cast

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.720
and have just three player characters.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:10.600
And it does harken back to earlier Final Fantasy games

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.120
where you had your character classes and job leveling.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:18.160
And it also is one of the few

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:21.880
Final Fantasy games that has multiple endings.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.720
The soundtrack is amazing.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:31.120
It was done by Matsueira Noriko and Eguchi Takahito

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.840
instead of Uematsu.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:39.200
But I mean, Uematsu is amazing, but this soundtrack is pretty damn amazing, too.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.760
And it was pretty successful.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.600
I mean, it sold over 5.4 million copies on PS2,

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:50.440
won a bunch of awards, and it was the last Final Fantasy

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:55.720
game to be released by Square before they merged with Enix in April 2003.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:00.560
It was re-released in high def as Final Fantasy 10

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.280
slash 10 to HD remaster,

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.000
which also came out on PlayStation 4 in 2015,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.760
Windows in 2016, and Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in 2019.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.680
And as of September 2021,

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:18.000
the Final Fantasy 10 series had sold over

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:21.800
20.8 million units worldwide.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:27.560
And it was even just by March 2022, it surpassed 21.1 million.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:34.840
So the game is set in the same universe, of course, as 10.

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.800
It is set in the world of Spira.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.720
This is two years after the events for Final Fantasy 10.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:46.320
And of course, with their major religion having been completely

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.360
you know, table flipped,

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:53.320
they are picking up the pieces with the younger group

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.680
going the way of technology and the older people

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:59.640
trying to recreate their Yevon religion.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.520
And so and then, of course, there's another group

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:06.480
that's selling tech to both sides to try to kill each other.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:11.000
But throughout all of this,

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:16.520
there is a character spirit who is woken up

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:22.800
and possesses certain people to try to end Spira

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:29.480
because of how he and his lover, Len, died.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.040
In the Japanese version, by the way, Len was voiced by Kotokumi,

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.400
who sang all the songs, which I think is awesome.

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:43.760
But at any rate, a lot of the characters from the previous

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:48.840
Final Fantasy 10 showed up as supporting roles

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.880
like Brother, Waka, and Lulu.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.600
There were other new characters introduced,

01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:01.480
like there was the LeBlanc Syndicate,

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.040
the faction leaders, other Spira hunters.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.760
And then, of course,

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:12.040
this is the main antagonist is Eshuin,

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.000
who is the spirit of a soldier that died

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.160
during the Makino War a thousand years before.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.440
So it's for the seriousness of the story,

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.720
there is a lot of lightheartedness that goes with it.

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:32.680
And I think that there is definitely that message

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:40.440
of dealing with lost love and grief that that really appealed to me.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.480
And with maybe a little bit of self-exploration through changing,

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:51.200
you know, I have seen the dressphere as a sort of like

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.800
trying on a new identity until you find the one that fits.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.800
I mean, I don't know if that makes sense or not,

01:20:58.800 --> 01:20:59.920
but that's kind of how I saw it.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.320
No, it totally does.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.840
Yeah. And I mean, especially since Yuna herself,

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.440
her whole identity had been wrapped up in being a summoner

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:10.000
and then there's nothing to summon.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:14.360
Well, in general, this is where her life is going,

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.600
what she's done to give it purpose.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.560
I mean, she totally expected to die in the first game, you know?

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.680
So at any rate,

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:32.200
the development of this was in response to a fan reaction

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.440
to the eternal calm that was in the Japanese version of Final Fantasy X

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.000
International that showed Yuna's life after the game.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.000
So 10-2 was released

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.520
shortly before the merger of Square and Enix,

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.800
and they didn't really care for the name 10-2,

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:56.080
but they just took it because it's a sequel and it worked.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:04.120
It also were, and this is actually Nojima Kazushige,

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:08.760
the previous game's writer was very skeptical about putting out a sequel,

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:12.520
especially one with a happy ending, but

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.920
they did it.

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.720
They were given, according to Nomura,

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:27.520
they were able to do the game in a year and a half

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:32.360
at its standard scope because of all of the character models,

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:36.920
the enemies and location designs that were still usable.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.520
And then as for most of the creation of this,

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:44.040
it was done in Autodesk Maya and Soft Image 3D.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.600
I know Maya, and it's a pain in the ass to use.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:54.520
So they said that the objective, the producers and directors said that

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:57.560
the objective when designing the game was to embrace

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.640
the concept of change as the main theme,

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.080
which is what I was bringing up before.

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.760
And they did make it more upbeat.

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.400
That's definitely what they wanted to do.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:12.320
They wanted to show what a drastic change was in Spira,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
because there's no summons, they redesigned to some of the towns,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.600
they included different vehicles,

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:25.120
and they had different elements that came directly from Japanese pop culture.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:31.280
And then they wanted to bring in,

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:38.600
they talked about bringing in Lulu as the third person instead of Pine,

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:45.480
because she would have been more of like an older sister

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:48.640
rather than Yuna being able to stand on her own feet.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.480
But they did give her a baby in the previous game.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.600
As far as the music goes, I mean, like I said,

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:00.880
it has a little bit more of a pop feel to it,

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:06.960
and the songs Real Emotion and Sen no Kotoba were done by Kotokumi.

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:13.040
And she also did the motion capture for Yuna's dancing

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.560
and did the voice for Len.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:21.920
Of course, the US one was done by Jade Villalon of Sweetbox,

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:28.880
who released full versions of the songs for her Japanese release of Adagio.

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:35.000
And Kotokumi released English versions of these on a CD single for Come With Me,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.040
although the translations for both are different.

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:41.560
But I mean, there was merchandise for everything.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:42.640
There was so much.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.360
There was an expanded version,

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.200
which is the Final Fantasy X-2 International and The Last Mission,

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.160
that had two new dresspheres,

01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:01.040
additional last mission location at the Yadanoki Tower,

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.960
and the ability to capture and battle different monsters.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.920
And it had Tidus, Aran, and Seymour from Final Fantasy X.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.720
It was not released outside of Japan,

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:18.480
even though it had the English voice track to use for the majority of the story.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.000
But I have that copy.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.360
And there were action figures and books and soundtracks and art books

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:32.840
and strategy guides and Ultimania guidebooks and all kinds of stuff.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:39.000
Horii, the peripheral gaming company,

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.720
had controllers that were modeled after Yuna's Tiny Bee guns.

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.360
These only came out in Japan.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.240
They were also re-released in the silver box

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.360
with the release of The International and Last Mission.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.960
And then they also created a vertical stand for the PS2

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:01.640
with the Final Fantasy X-2 logo that lights up in blue when it's plugged in.

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:07.280
And so, of course, there was the HD version that came out.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:11.320
It worked with Kitase Yoshinori involved.

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:21.040
And, you know, all of these releases of it were pretty well received.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.520
I mean, the soundtrack was kind of mixed

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:28.840
because it kind of went on that J-pop front instead of with any input from Uematsu.

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:33.440
EGM called it too bubbly, but what do they know?

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.440
I mean, there's just way too many people that were complaining about

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.160
missing the old guard.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.880
But the thing is that this game was meant to embody the new,

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:52.680
you know, to indicate change, to show a change in the world,

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:56.600
a change in people, personality, that type of thing.

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.640
And so after this one came out,

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:05.120
they finally did other direct sequels to Final Fantasy games,

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.880
including Dirge of Cerberus and then Final Fantasy IV,

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.120
The After Years, and two sequels to Final Fantasy XIII.

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.880
I mean, this is the other problem that people had with this game,

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.600
is that it was considered girly.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:28.080
And I think that the people who didn't like it because it was girly

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.480
need to have their... I think that they're full of shit.

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.320
So I'm not going to mince my words about it.

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:41.800
But I really liked that with enough work,

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:45.960
you could get a happy ending to this game.

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.200
I mean, spoilers for how old game is this now?

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:56.560
But in one of... there's actually two extra endings where one of them,

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.360
you get Tidus back, like the Faith fully bring him back as a real boy.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.200
He's a real boy now.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.520
And then the other one, you have an extended conversation

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.320
between him and Yuna and Zanarkand,

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:16.440
where they talk about, you know, are you real?

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.240
And it's like, well, yeah, as real as you think I am, I guess.

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:23.440
You know, but it's a really interesting,

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.160
you know, it's a very serious conversation for a lighthearted ending.

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:34.400
But at any rate, I love this game.

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:38.320
I much prefer the music in Japanese

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.640
just because I was a big Kotokumi fan before this game came out.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.280
So I'm not going to say that the US,

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.880
the English versions are bad.

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.880
I mean, they're great.

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.000
And if I had heard them first, I might have liked them better.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.360
But it is what it is.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.920
So that's why I wanted to put up the Japanese copy,

01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.760
because that's the version I like best.

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:04.720
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Final Fantasy X-2.

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:08.360
This is also interesting because I don't remember exactly

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.520
the year this came out, but it must have been around 2013.

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.560
It was 2013. It was really that far.

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:15.800
I thought it was more around the time

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:18.840
when this show had just started as a 2003.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.960
OK, I was going to say, I thought it was around the time

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.840
this show started as a podcast.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.880
I don't know why I said 2013. It was 2003.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.480
Because I remember in an early episode of OLR,

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:33.320
we were like, Jamie was saying it's 10-2 and I kept saying X-2.

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.680
And I was like, you know what, I'm just going to email Square.

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:40.520
And they actually wrote back and Square confirmed that it was 10-2

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.080
is the correct pronunciation of it.

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.440
So it was just is kind of kind of fun.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.240
I've been smug about it ever since.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.280
Yeah, let me tell you about it. Yeah.

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:51.320
So no, but it's it's it's kind of, you know, neat.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.880
But it was it was certainly unconventional naming.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:55.800
Like, you know, there was a part of me that always wondered,

01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:58.640
why didn't they just make this Final Fantasy 11

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.960
and call what ultimately was Final Fantasy 11 Final Fantasy Online?

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:07.240
Because Final Fantasy 11 just doesn't feel like a standard Final Fantasy game.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.360
And so what? There's a few characters in common.

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.440
But I understand ultimately what each world is its own.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.120
Yeah, I know.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:19.160
Especially think of it like the Marvel Universe, right? Right.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:21.320
The main universe is 616.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.720
And then there's, you know, all these other numbers.

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:27.560
Well, and especially then when they started doing 13 and 13,

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.920
two in the after years and all the other stuff you named in there,

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.480
like, especially when they started getting into all that.

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:35.080
Like, I understand why they did what they did.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:39.400
But yeah, I mean, you know, it's it's hard to understate

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.680
just what a big deal it was that they were doing a sequel

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:45.240
to a Final Fantasy game like this at the time. It was weird.

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:50.080
But now it's less weird, very giddy and then being excited about importing it.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:56.520
So but but no, it's it's I mean, even to this day,

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.360
I think as a game, it still holds up. Mm hmm.

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:01.920
So confession, I've barely played it.

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.600
I know this surprises people, but I've barely played it.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.640
I keep meaning to get around to the HD remaster, but I keep saying

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.160
I'm not going to play it until I beat Final Fantasy 10.

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.080
And we all know what happens.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:15.280
Of course, I don't because something shiny comes out of the international copy.

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:19.360
I have the HD remasters, you know, which I think the newer ones,

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.840
the HD remasters, do they have the newer ones are, I think.

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.760
I think the original ones on PS3 weren't.

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:31.040
But then the ones on PS4 were, I think. Don't hold me on that.

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:34.480
So I'll have to go back and look.

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.480
But I saw something.

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.600
Where is it? There is one about the

01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:40.920
the other release.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.560
Here we go. The last mission.

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.440
Did this change parts of the Japanese subtitles

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.280
or change or alter to fit the voiceovers?

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:51.960
This is detailed strategy book for the international version.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:58.560
It doesn't. I mean, they probably were,

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.640
but it didn't say anything about it being included,

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.320
but I wouldn't doubt that it was. Yeah.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.960
As Joe points out, they were on Game Pass until recently.

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:06.880
I believe you're right.

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.800
The Final Fantasy games were kind of a lot of them were cycling through,

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.840
but they appear to only be good for a year because like Final Fantasy

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:16.240
13 and 13 two are no longer there or like

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:20.360
13 two is almost up as is lightning returns.

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:23.720
So, yeah, they're kind of cycling through Game Pass, unfortunately.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.520
So you got to buy it at this point.

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:30.400
But those I mean, they've been out a while and they go on sale frequently.

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.880
So it's pretty easy to pick up whatever Final Fantasy HD game

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.080
you want for 20 bucks if you just wait for the right sale.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:41.320
And considering we're coming up on all the storefront holiday sales,

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:44.960
especially what Steam starts December 22nd, Epic just started.

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:49.600
I'm sure PlayStation and Microsoft are going to set their sales

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:53.000
before they leave the office next week, and then it'll be a sale for like two weeks.

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.640
So. It's coming

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.520
if you want to catch up on that stuff.

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.040
All right. Great pick.

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.240
I'm as surprised as anyone else that hadn't been picked already,

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:08.240
but that happens sometimes some good ones slip through all of surprises.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.720
Yeah. All right.

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:12.480
Let's travel around quickly and check out some other news

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:15.280
going on in the industry in some rapid fire news.

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:19.720
Loki. Yeah. So first off, I want to start with a cool ROM hack

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.880
that I saw posted on Twitter.

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:26.960
So this is actually a it's called Contravania, the Ecclesia edition.

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:29.880
It is a ROM hack of Castlevania

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.760
order of Ecclesia.

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:37.120
And it's basically adds

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.920
the characters from Contra,

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.600
mainly actually a Contra rebirth

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:45.880
into the game, and it plays like Contra.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.360
That is very awesome.

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.360
So they have multiple different patches

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.080
you can do to it to get different characters in there.

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:58.480
So they have like Bill Riser, Genbei, Yagyu,

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:02.560
Propotector, Pliskin, Brad Fang,

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:05.520
and then for some reason, Sans from Undertales in there.

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.760
I don't really know what that's all about, but it looks.

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.560
I'm sorry, we said Yagyu Jubei.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.720
It's Genbei Yagyu.

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:20.480
It's there from Contra Rebirth.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.200
OK, I was just thinking of the of

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:28.720
I mean, because a lot of games will reuse the historical person as a character.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.560
And I was like, whoa, well, it's sort of kind of like so that

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.840
that person is sort of kind of based off of that.

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.440
They look like a samurai, but the eye patch and everything.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.240
Yes. And they have.

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.880
OK, that's cool.

01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:44.240
So, yeah, that's awesome.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.640
Yeah. So they've got that.

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.040
It's it looks cool.

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:52.560
Like I just saw the gameplay online and it's amazing.

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:54.480
But yeah, it's for the DS version of the game.

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:58.280
So there is, I think, one emulator on PC that works with it.

01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:02.160
And obviously, if you have a flash cart, you can put it on your actual DS

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:05.440
and then, you know, lots of other homebrew options

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.800
available for playing DS games as well.

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.400
So go check that out. Pretty cool.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:13.800
And then Super Nintendo World

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:18.160
in Universal Hollywood finally has an opening date,

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:22.240
and that is February 17th, 2023.

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.560
We can go experience

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.360
the boring Yoshi ride and then the komari car ride.

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:30.960
That's going to sneak up on us.

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.680
February 17th is, if you think about it, like two months away.

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.080
So, yeah, not that long.

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.120
Yeah, I'm excited. I want to go check it out.

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.880
I don't think I'll go the first day for sure.

01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:43.480
But no, if I can, if I can figure out when spring break is

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:47.040
and like not go that week either, like on a weekday in March or April.

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.720
Sounds great to just check it out.

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:49.760
I think it'll be a lot of fun.

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.640
Yeah, I want to go again.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.960
All right, Darcy.

01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:02.080
So Amazon has announced that they are developing a God of War series.

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.600
They were in talks with Sony to adapt it.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.680
They reported this back in March,

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:14.760
and they were reporting that the creators and producers of The Expanse,

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:20.040
along with the executive producer of Wheel of Time,

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:25.760
would be leading the project with input from Sony.

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:27.800
And Amazon said, yep, we're doing that.

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:32.880
So we'll see how it turns out.

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.960
We're going to hear a lot of boy.

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.440
Yeah. Speaking of things that are around the corner,

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:41.160
that Last of Us series is just a couple of weeks away.

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.480
So it's oh, wow. Yeah, it's like a quick.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.280
Yeah, right. Mid-January, right?

01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:46.520
It's going to be here before we know it.

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:49.720
So wild. But yeah, God of War, that should be fun, too.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.920
All right. Moving on.

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:55.680
I got really excited at the Game Awards when I heard that Sony's

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:58.200
Returnal is going to be coming out for PC.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:01.600
And I guess I'm thankful I have a new rig because I have enough RAM

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.440
to make this work.

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:07.240
But boy, oh boy, they are recommending 32 gigs of RAM.

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:12.040
You can run Returnal with 16 gigs, but they are recommending

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:15.520
this is per Returnal Steam listing 32 gigs to get the most out of,

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.400
you know, the graphics and the gameplay.

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:20.040
For the record, Microsoft's Flight Simulator,

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.080
which if you've ever played that game, especially in 4K, is gorgeous.

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:28.440
That game requires eight and recommends 16.

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.840
So Returnal needs more RAM than Flight Simulator.

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:33.200
Honestly, I'm kind of not surprised considering, you know,

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:35.200
what a fast moving game Returnal is.

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.640
Flight Simulator is more of a fly and chill.

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:40.640
Returnal has like a lot of stuff going on on the screen.

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:43.720
It's a very fast moving game, so not completely surprised.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:45.720
That's probably why it needs so much RAM.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:48.040
Sounds like it's very unoptimized, if you ask me.

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.240
That could probably be, too.

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:54.720
So we'll see. No, no, no, nothing known yet.

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.960
If it will include support for Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's

01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:02.640
FSR's upscaling technology, but we'll see.

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.440
Apparently, some leaked video is giving insight that it might.

01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:10.440
Also, other system requirements.

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:16.400
You'll need an Intel i7-8700 or an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X CPU.

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:22.040
And you need to have at least an Nvidia RTX 2070 Super or an AMD RX

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:25.760
6700 XT GPU to meet the recommended specs.

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.120
Money.

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.960
Yeah, I know it's, but I mean, you know, you're talking about playing

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:35.000
a PlayStation 5 game on your PC, so I can understand why it's so demanding.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.200
But yeah, it's not going to be cheap, that's for sure, though.

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.640
I will probably pick it up, but we'll see.

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.920
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:54.040
I don't know if it's still busy, but I guess especially with digital storefronts,

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.600
who knows, but I feel like this time of year is more for sales.

01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.040
But let's see anyway.

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:00.080
Loki, anything coming out in the US this week?

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:01.040
Not a lot.

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.480
There's Majestic

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:08.760
Magical looks like, and that's on Nintendo Switch.

01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.960
Uta no Princess Sama All Star After Secret on Nintendo Switch

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.200
and Valkyrie Profile Lineth on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.400
That's it. That's it for the year.

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:22.920
We're all done.

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:26.000
All right. Well, going to Japan, obviously, the holidays flow

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.320
a little different there.

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:30.200
So you do have some releases still on the Nintendo Switch this week,

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:33.080
including that same Uta no Prince Sama is out this week.

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.440
Earth Defense Force 4.1, The Shadow of New Despair.

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.400
That is coming out in Japan this week.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.520
Majestic Majolical is also out this week,

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:46.360
as well as Fitness Boxing Fist of the North Star,

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.640
which I want to see.

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:49.160
Didn't we talk about that on a previous show

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.400
because we talked about the arcade game they used to have?

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.800
Well, that's finally out on the Switch this week, so enjoy that.

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.720
Money Parasite is out this week as well.

01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:01.520
And a game called Witch's Garden in regular and limited edition

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.840
is also out on the Switch this week.

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.040
Going over to the PlayStation 5.

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.800
That one's a little more empty.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.080
We might see like one lone release next week,

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.600
but otherwise a little quiet on the PS5 front.

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.840
But lots of stuff for Switch fans this week.

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.520
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:20.040
One thing on there and didn't even give it a date.

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.400
Oh, actually, I take that back.

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.960
The date was yesterday

01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:28.480
for Switch was WRC Generations.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:31.400
All right. Well, it's that time of year

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.920
where things are slowing down to be expected.

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:36.280
All right. We have just a few more stories for you,

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.440
and then we will get to the listener roundtable.

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.040
I know we have at least one email tonight,

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:44.800
and we'll see if we get any comments and possibly some calls over at Discord,

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.480
our VOG Network Discord server.

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.760
Speaking of Discord, we're going to do something next week.

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:51.960
Show is on a weird day.

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:54.280
So we're going to do something a little bit special,

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.720
and it's going to involve Discord.

01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.520
And I'm going to explain that in a little bit.

01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.200
But first, let's get into a few more stories, starting with Loki.

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.520
Yeah, so Justin Roiland's new game High on Life.

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.520
It was revealed that the bigger studio

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:14.720
Squanch Games used the AI art tool mid journey AI

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.400
to generate some assets for the game

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.840
and add some quote unquote finishing touches.

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.360
Now, basically, they were saying that they used AI art tools

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.400
because it doesn't look like as if a person made them.

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.920
It's kind of like almost alien, sort of.

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:42.920
And so they said it made the world feel like a strange alternate

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:45.240
universe of our world.

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:49.520
And we used it to make or to come up with weird, funny ideas.

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:53.640
So I can imagine like generating different things and it's all messed up.

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:57.360
So then they take those assets to kind of

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
make their own art, I guess it's almost like concept art, I guess.

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:06.760
Basically saying I don't know what that's in very well with Rick and Morty.

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:10.840
Yeah, I don't know what the future holds, but AI is going to be a tool

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:14.360
that has potential to make content creation incredibly accessible.

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.400
I don't know how many years away we are,

01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:21.000
but all you will need is somebody with some big ideas.

01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:25.000
Of course, you know, it's still controversial with using AI art

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.160
anyways, because it is being trained off of a lot of artists

01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:33.280
work who didn't necessarily consent to being used.

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:37.240
And one of those major sites that artists do showcase

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:40.240
a lot of their work that they do is, of course,

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:47.440
ArtStation, who was actually being included in some of these AI trainings

01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:52.680
and made a comment regarding permission and AI art generators.

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:56.480
This is we believe artists should be free to decide how their art is used.

01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:00.000
And simultaneously, we don't want to become gatekeepers with the site

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.640
terms that stifle AI research and commercialization

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:08.640
when it respects artists choices and copyright laws.

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:13.560
So their plans right now are going to be enabling

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:17.520
or adding tags enabling artists to choose explicitly to allow

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:22.200
or disallow the use of art for training and non-commercial AI research

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:24.800
and to train commercial AI.

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:27.080
And they plan to update ArtStation

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:30.920
website's terms of service to disallow the use of art or whatever.

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.560
Artists aren't happy about that

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:37.280
because they feel they should be taking a stronger stance

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:41.560
to protect their works, but they are not doing that.

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:46.480
So obviously, they have been protesting by putting no AI type stuff.

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:50.120
Also, like, I mean, it doesn't account for all the AI

01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.440
that's already been trained on that stuff, so.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:56.680
I don't know, it's it's it's a tricky subject.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:03.280
Yeah, it's tricky because, you know, obviously I don't love the idea of AI,

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:06.360
you know, basically because like, you know, that app that came out recently,

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.920
I remember it was called, but everybody was posting their pictures on Facebook

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:12.200
and stuff, and for me, I was a little I was more like,

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.840
I feel like every time one of these hot new apps comes out,

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:16.920
you find out something about the development team you don't like.

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:19.320
So I stayed away from it.

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:22.000
But, you know, it looked like a lot of the pictures that are coming out of it

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.280
are basically like artwork that literally was someone else's,

01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:29.320
but like with someone's head slapped onto it

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:32.320
and the fingers all different because I can never get fingers right.

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:36.000
So it's like a former president's NFT drop or something.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.360
It's really weird. I'm not going to go there.

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:42.800
But, you know, so so AI is is really silly in that regard.

01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:45.800
And the fact that, you know, it's using stolen artwork isn't cool.

01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:51.520
However, that being said, I don't like to just brush off AI artistry

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:55.040
all in one fell swoop because I kind of see where,

01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:58.560
you know, if we're talking about next gen gaming, especially when we get into

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.840
like PlayStation six game development, I know I'm getting way ahead of myself here.

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.440
But you know how hard it's going to be to animate for these,

01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:10.360
you know, 8K TVs or whatever, you know, graphical fidelities coming up next

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.440
and so forth, it's going to get harder and harder.

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:17.080
So I can see where maybe AI starts to get useful

01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:21.840
in developing like really high definition art later on.

01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:26.200
But that would all be trained off of art that the studio is doing

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:28.560
and rules that the studio builds into their engine,

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.600
which is obviously a very different sort of argument.

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.200
But that's where I'm like, OK, that's where AI art makes sense to me,

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:37.280
is literally automating processes

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:40.760
that otherwise would cause a game 20 years to get made.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.280
That makes sense.

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:45.800
But the whole like, you know, plugging your face or your

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.680
and I see this shit for sale on Facebook all the time,

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:53.200
plugging your dog into the dogs playing poker artwork and all this stuff like

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:54.040
this is silly.

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:57.560
And, you know, obviously dogs playing poker is one because that's classic.

01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:01.720
But when it's, you know, somebody's deviant art or art station or whatever,

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:05.040
and it feels a little slimy to be doing that to me.

01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:07.320
They've had some really cool like applications

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:10.040
even outside of the art stuff, like the chat GPT stuff,

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:13.440
which where you can actually have like conversations with the chat bot

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.520
and it'll like, you know, I said, OK, like, here's some code I wrote.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:19.760
Can you rewrite it in this language and it will do it for you or like,

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:23.200
hey, I need you to generate me something that does this

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:25.880
and it will usually do it correctly.

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:27.840
And it's pretty incredible, like some of the stuff

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:31.080
where they'll explain to you like how to do something in a certain way.

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:33.400
And it's pretty cool.

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:37.800
So like that, combined with like some of these things, it's me.

01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.920
It's when you kind of take it to the extremes, though, where it's

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:43.080
it's starting to get a little bit like ridiculous.

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:47.000
Like there is somebody who generated a.

01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:50.040
Children's book using an A.I.

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.960
to write the book for him and then use another A.I.

01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:55.680
to create the pictures for it and then publish that as his own work.

01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.200
Which is kind of like.

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.560
I don't know, it's a little weird.

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:02.320
It is a little weird.

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:06.000
Credit, it's definitely on the darker side of gray.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Yeah, credit the robot with writing the book, right?

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.360
Credit credit seven and nine with writing your book.

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.080
You know, don't credit, you know, yourself.

01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:17.040
It's a little silly.

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.200
And then right now we've had all the A.I.

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:23.960
is being trained off of like with specific rules in place.

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:26.960
Like what's going to happen later on when

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.320
we start having people train them to do other things like, you know.

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.680
Photoshop celebrities into different pornographic situations.

01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:38.920
Oh, yeah. And it's just going to get nuts.

01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:42.760
Yeah, that's, you know, or or like even not even necessarily that,

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:45.960
but like even like the faking, deep fakes, deeper fakes,

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:48.280
deepest fakes, deep, dark fakes.

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:52.600
Yeah, like faking, because you can have a I generate voices

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:57.040
like it can take someone's voice and figure out how to speak like it

01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:00.360
and reproduce that with whatever you want.

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:02.280
So like you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:05.080
Wild, wild.

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:06.080
Well, that A.I.

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:08.760
to determine whether something's A.I. generated or not. Right.

01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:12.320
The test determined that was A.I.

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:14.600
All right.

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:15.880
I just need an A.I.

01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:18.680
to prove that I'm not a robot so that, you know,

01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:20.200
I don't have to fill those things out anymore.

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:23.600
Maybe, maybe we all are secretly half Cylon.

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.600
Who knows? Anyway,

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.880
Dijarama says Adobe came out with a program for A.I.

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:31.440
voices caused an uproar in the voice acting community.

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.160
Oh, I bet. Tiger Cost says there's A.I.

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:37.720
generated podcast that had Joe Rogan interviewing Steve Jobs.

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:40.200
I can think of nothing I want to hear less.

01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:43.080
All right. In a sense, yes, yes, I get that.

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:44.560
Like and that's horrible.

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:49.600
But I'm just saying, but I do like the premise of like generating

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:51.400
funny things with some of these.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.160
Like, for example, it's funnier when it's like the daily show

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:56.680
using clips from an actual interview.

01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:57.680
Well, no, I like that.

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:00.760
But like there is something I saw where it was like like

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.600
it was that chat chat

01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.000
GBT thing where it's like, hey, I want you to explain me this

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:10.160
as a script for Seinfeld or something like there's a Seinfeld episode.

01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:11.320
And that was funny.

01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:14.320
Like some of the stuff that they do with that,

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.000
I think is pretty funny. Hmm.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.120
All right.

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:21.760
Well, I don't know if a robot could create this next game,

01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.520
but Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:31.040
A very, very interesting flashback,

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:33.720
I would say, you know, emphasis on the flash

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:38.400
Fantavision 2020 X

01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:45.560
is coming out on PlayStation five with PlayStation VR to support.

01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:51.400
It's going to be a digital game to release on February 22nd, 2023.

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:55.560
And now the original came out on PlayStation two.

01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:59.960
As I'm sure we might remember, it was people like, what's with this game?

01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:03.080
And then everyone played it and was like, oh, this game is kind of addicting.

01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:08.680
But you basically hit like different missiles,

01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:11.520
kind of, I guess, defender ish.

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:15.120
Am I thinking of defender or missile command?

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:17.560
Missile command, my brain, I can't brain.

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:21.480
And then they explode and they're pretty.

01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:22.720
There's more to it than that.

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:25.400
But the explode and pretty part is is really awesome.

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:29.960
And then it'll have like vibration feedback through the controller

01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:34.200
and all kinds of haptic joy and and explosions.

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:37.040
And then you get a star mine.

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:42.040
I don't know if their trailer does it justice, but it doesn't look that great.

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:45.240
Like it's like I saw the trailer graphic.

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:50.000
It does look like Fantavision, but it doesn't look like a PlayStation five game.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.680
It looks like a PlayStation three game.

01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:55.680
And it's like and I get it like maybe for the VR part of that,

01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:59.080
they have a scale of all the one on PlayStation VR to be able to push

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.560
better fidelity than that.

01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:03.640
It just doesn't look.

01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:08.160
It looks dated like and that's too bad because Fantavision was great title.

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:14.560
I can tell you just said it just now, Jamie, that the game's coming out in February.

01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:18.280
I kind of forgot that PSVR two is like that close to release.

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:21.120
I thought we were still a ways out from that, but wowee.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.120
Well, Shane's in chat and he's excited for this.

01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:27.480
He says, I'm here day one for Fantavision for my PSVR two.

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:31.280
There's like 30 launch titles now for it, and it makes me more excited to get mine.

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:35.240
I hope the crazy, nonsensical Fantavision cutscenes are in this one, too.

01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:37.960
Dr. Seuss says, I'm surprised they brought this back.

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:40.800
I think this is one of the first PS two games I ever played.

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:41.800
Yeah, a lot of love.

01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:43.080
A lot of people is like their first.

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:45.360
Maybe it's the YouTube dance now.

01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:46.920
Doo doo doo doo doo.

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:50.200
Of course. Maybe it's the YouTube compression that's doing it

01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:52.320
because I'm looking at the screenshots and they look better.

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:55.920
But like, yeah, the YouTube video does not look great.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:59.960
Check your options and make sure it's not defaulting to a low resolution.

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:01.840
No, it's 1080. It's just.

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:06.880
Yeah, because they're they're talking about like 4K graphics and stuff like that.

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:09.280
And so maybe maybe that would look better,

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:12.120
but it did look kind of not great in the other one.

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:16.120
SSG100 Matt says, semi-related, I kind of miss Boom Boom Rocket.

01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:17.280
I should try to reload it.

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:18.680
Oh, that was a good one.

01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:21.040
I think it is backwards compatible.

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:25.040
I believe if you had that on 360, it shows up in your Xbox one library,

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:28.440
which would in turn show up in your Series X library.

01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:33.360
And all the songs in that game were like redone classical tunes.

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:34.920
It's like the William Tell Overture and stuff.

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:36.920
So they don't have to worry about licensing,

01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:39.520
causing the game to get delisted or any of that stuff.

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:42.800
So if you had Boom Boom Rocket, I don't know if they still sell it.

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:45.720
I don't see why they wouldn't, though.

01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:48.840
But yeah, Boom Boom Rocket was like kind of Fantavision meets

01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:51.080
an actual music game title. It was a little bit of both.

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.080
So I remember that one. It was a lot of fun.

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:58.240
I remember there was one achievement I couldn't get and I was so mad.

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.600
I don't remember which one it was, but I almost want to go back and do it.

01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:01.880
So, oh, Dr.

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:04.040
C is I know I saw it on the store still.

01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:06.480
All right. Well, it's still there. That's cool.

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:10.120
All right. Loki, another Hollywood story. Yeah.

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:15.440
Yep. I keep forgetting that they are actually making a Five Nights at Freddy's

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:20.200
movie, Blumhouse's, and they've announced a couple more actors

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:21.480
that are joining the cast.

01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:24.000
So Matthew Lillard from,

01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:28.880
you know, a 13 ghost scream and of course, you know, Shaggy

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:34.440
and then Josh Hutcherson, who I recognize,

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.480
but I don't remember which movies it in.

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:38.600
They say tragedy girls, but I've never seen that.

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.000
But he's been in other things, too.

01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:44.480
And what's cool is they say Jim Henson's

01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:47.040
creature shop is working on the animatronic.

01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:49.680
Oh, that's fun. That's going to be good.

01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:52.120
I mean, fantastic.

01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:53.240
So I can't wait to see this.

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:54.200
Don't know what's coming out.

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.320
They started filming back in February.

01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:00.840
Yeah. Walk the wait and see you get.

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:04.960
Or well, maybe with the did they film in February or they got to start filming?

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.800
They start and you know, I'll be gone.

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:11.120
And I was going to say, you don't announce your cast eight months after.

01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:14.280
Yeah. OK, so yeah, they're going to start filming in February.

01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:18.760
So hopefully, hopefully they're in the next year or, you know, early 2024.

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:24.240
Mission chat says can confirm Boom Boom Rocket is still on the Xbox store for 10 bucks.

01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:26.120
So there you go about that one.

01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:29.240
As John Hunter Matt agrees, it will be great that Jim Henson's

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.200
creature shop is working on this.

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:33.840
Tiger Claw is wondering, I wonder what the tone of the movie will be,

01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:36.760
a horror comedy, and will it be PG-13?

01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:38.640
I think it's almost certainly PG-13.

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:41.680
They're not going to go are and think the games were never gory.

01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:45.280
It was always implied violence is jump scares and implied violence.

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:47.640
So I really don't see why it's not.

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:49.400
So it's hard to say.

01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:51.360
I guess that's true.

01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:56.680
But I feel like they kind of market some of the merch at kids.

01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:59.880
So I don't know why they would want to shut at least like older teens.

01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:01.760
I don't know why they would want to shut them out of the movie.

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.280
I think that would be foolish.

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:05.000
You're right. I think it probably would be like a team.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Yeah, I think they're going to aim for PG-13 and it's

01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:10.040
they're just going to not be gory.

01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:13.040
But even it's like looking at like some of their other movies

01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:17.080
that they had come out, like was it that one Megan with the creepy doll thing?

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:18.560
Can't fucking wait for that.

01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:21.080
Just to be clear, the PG-13.

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.080
So a lot of horror movies are PG-13.

01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:25.440
They're just they're not super gory.

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:28.920
The Ring was PG-13 when it was, you know, the U.S. version

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:31.440
when Naomi Watts was was PG-13.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.360
The Sixth Sense, even though maybe not the best example, I think was PG-13.

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:37.040
Or did they say fuck too much in that movie?

01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.000
It might have been an hour, but I think it was PG-13.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.640
I mean, something like Hereditary.

01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:42.040
Yeah, of course, that's art.

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:45.400
If you know that movie or God, what was the other one that director did?

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:48.400
It's like one of Dark Soccer's favorite movies, not Hereditary Midsommar.

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:50.920
If Midsommar is great.

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:53.360
Yeah, but Midsommar is definitely R rated.

01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:58.280
But you can do horror movies and PG-13 for sure.

01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:02.640
And and by the way, that Megan movie, it's only out in a couple of weeks.

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:04.600
Oh, I'm so excited.

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:07.640
I want to see every six Avatar two.

01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:08.720
I'm like, eh, whatever.

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:10.600
Megan, fuck yes.

01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:13.440
I meant to go out this week to see Violent Night,

01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:16.880
but that may be a way to see on video.

01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:19.600
Remember when we all went to go see the first Avatar together?

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:22.760
We went on a big date together and we saw it in 3D.

01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:23.680
I think it was the theater.

01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:25.680
I saw it so many times. I don't remember.

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:29.640
Yeah, I've heard good things about it to the sequel, honestly.

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:31.600
Yeah, I've heard good things about Avatar, too.

01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:37.000
But I and keep in mind the original Poltergeist was PG because PG-13 didn't exist.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.920
Yep. Yep. Yeah.

01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:41.160
She-Hope just pointed out about Poltergeist being PG.

01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:43.320
Yeah, but it would have been PG-13 if that had existed.

01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:45.040
That's for sure. So, yeah.

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.680
So. All right.

01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:53.240
Moving on, let's go to our last story tonight, which very random,

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:55.840
but sometimes random things turn up in the gaming world.

01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:58.800
And it's a lost Michael Jackson clip.

01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:02.720
And it has to do with Michael Jackson and the Sega world.

01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:06.960
You remember how Michael Jackson very clearly worked with Sega,

01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:09.720
like was kind of shadow working on some projects, right?

01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:17.960
Well, apparently, some fans have actually uncovered an extra kind of like bonus role of Michael Jackson.

01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:25.560
He was the lead actor in the Advanced System One or AS1 motion simulator game Scramble Training.

01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:30.320
Apparently, they found the tape at a flea market in the UK.

01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:37.080
And if you wanted to watch this on YouTube, there was just a shit camcorder 90s shaky thing that was out there.

01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:43.280
But thanks to finding basically either the master or a direct copy of it at a random flea market in the UK,

01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:45.800
you can see a direct transfer of the footage.

01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:51.280
And let's be honest, Michael Jackson, not really known for his acting.

01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:55.280
Video games at that time, really not known for their acting.

01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:59.560
You put the two together and you get not so great acting.

01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:05.440
But it's a piece of video game history that's like, whoa, kind of neat to be seeing this now.

01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:06.880
Yeah, what's that?

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:07.920
Thank you.

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:08.720
Thank you.

01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:18.800
Anyway, and yeah, apparently the guy who had the stuff he was selling at the flea market, he had some Sega merchandise

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:23.120
he got from a gentleman whose father a former Sega employee had recently passed away.

01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:31.120
The the lucky buyer found promo posters, toys, and then apparently a D2 tape he forgot to mention he'd paid a fair bit for.

01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:32.440
So how about that?

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:34.960
Anyway, so that's all over the internet.

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.840
Now it's available on YouTube.

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:41.040
Just look up Michael Jackson and scramble training game does all good if you care.

01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:42.720
No, it sure doesn't.

01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:44.520
But, you know, not great.

01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:46.560
Yeah, but it's one of those things.

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:49.640
Again, you know, it's it's very dated technology.

01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:50.680
It's late 90s.

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:57.440
So anyway, but it also loses something, too, because I think it's like one of those motion roller coaster ride things.

01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:58.760
Yes, yes.

01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:01.040
So I'm very little bit a little bit.

01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:02.040
All right.

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:14.120
And that brings us to the listener roundtable where every week we invite your questions via our mailbag participate at orange lounge radio.com, as well as our discord server over at vog network.com.

01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:16.280
That's VOG network.com slash discord.

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:20.760
And you can also ask questions in chat if you'd like.

01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:23.160
I believe we have one email tonight, though.

01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:25.080
So I'm going to turn it over to dark Sakura.

01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:27.400
It's a pretty short one.

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:31.240
Hi, this is I can't see from Twitch and Discord.

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:42.520
As a staunch supporter of cloud gaming, including Stadia, I've noticed that there's this old guard mentality in gaming mentality includes only buying disk based consoles and physical media.

01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:49.160
They worry about the, quote, all digital future, end quote, and prefer to, quote, own their own games.

01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:57.880
Because of this, some aspects of modern and future gaming habits are outside of their norm, so they turn up their noses at them.

01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:03.160
Things like mobile, live service, FTP, and of course, cloud gaming.

02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:06.800
I won't bring up the two biggest taboo elephants in the room.

02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:10.400
There's still a demand for ownership and the older ways.

02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:14.800
How do you think the industry could cater to the old guard while looking to the future?

02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:27.840
I'm kind of thinking like the limited rent game stuff does, you know, you know, where it becomes like a big collector's item and you get more reward for owning the game.

02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:30.120
It's a physical copy because it has stuff.

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:44.520
Well, first off, thank you for the email I can't see, which I believe as a Stadia fan, I might be jumping to conclusions, but I'm assuming found our show through that YouTube show you did all about Stadia, Dark Sakura, right before they

02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:47.560
betrayed me and broke my heart.

02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:50.000
Right before Stadia pulled the plug on everything.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.120
So welcome.

02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:51.760
How dare.

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:53.800
Glad we grew our family from that appearance.

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:57.000
By the way, all of us available for appearances on other shows.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.960
I just did Pokemon Go podcast this week.

02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:01.080
It's not on their feed yet, or at least it wasn't earlier today.

02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:04.200
So I haven't linked it anywhere, but I had a good time with them this week.

02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:04.960
But I digress.

02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:05.680
Let me get to the email.

02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:12.360
So I have definitely been of that mindset for a long time that physical copies are more desirable.

02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:31.760
And the reason why is because I think the used game market and the second hand game market has set up the expectation that you can have some equity in your games, basically some value in your games, especially we've seen how for some older games and some classic games that can really grow.

02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:43.440
For example, try to get a copy of Suikoden 2 for the PlayStation, at least before they, you know, especially before they or Suikoden 1 or 2 before they did the PS3 download everything even now those games go for a lot.

02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:48.480
I'm sure Dark Sakura can tell you about some, you know, physical games that go for a lot of money.

02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:51.320
Just look up Ninja Gaiden trilogy.

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:51.720
Yeah.

02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:54.880
Look up Mighty Final Fight, Final Fight Guy.

02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:56.960
I own all three of these.

02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:14.440
Now, while these are old school examples, I think a lot of people kind of hope that maybe if they hang on to their physical libraries, they're going to grow in value at some point, or even if I don't care for the game, I can still turn it around and get $10 back, right?

02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:20.880
So I think, for me, that's been why I've been tied to physical media for a long time and having that equity.

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:29.600
Now, if the value is there to kind of get some of that back in a digital title, then I'm all about digital.

02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:37.480
And what I mean by that is, look, if you're going to discount the game for 50%, but I get it digitally, I can at least go, okay, well, I only paid half as much for this.

02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:40.200
So okay, if I can't turn around and sell this back.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:46.480
You asked in the email, how do you think the digital market could maybe gain something with a physical market?

02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:55.680
I remember a date and time when I think Steam was going to do this, Microsoft was going to do this, but then they got shot down.

02:02:55.680 --> 02:02:57.240
But that was a different sort of circumstances.

02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:04.360
But that is put equity in your digital games, make it so that you can turn around and sell your digital games.

02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:10.720
You might remember this was in Microsoft's original vision for the Xbox One, but it was a little ahead of its time.

02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:15.040
And I don't think they were clear in the way they communicated a lot of that.

02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:20.520
And a lot of that got shot down and they were forced to really, you know, do a 180 on that.

02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:23.640
I just think Don Mattrick was a shitty messenger at the time.

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:38.840
And I think could have could have probably done something a lot different with some better messaging of the Xbox One's original vision with that by allowing a system where your digital games, your digital library has equity would have been huge.

02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:44.200
So I think that would have that would have been a great thing, but it didn't work out that way.

02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:46.720
Unfortunately, Xbox is in a fine place.

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:48.440
Now we got Game Pass and all this other stuff.

02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:59.480
But, you know, but then I understand your nerves when it comes to things like Game Pass, you know, where movies go, the game industry is going to follow.

02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:02.400
And so that's why you've got things like Game Pass.

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:04.480
And now Sony is following those footsteps.

02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:12.360
And I kind of I feel like Stadia if they'd offered something along that line, and I guess they did.

02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:16.640
But again, it wasn't communicated the best way outside of its fan base.

02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:20.800
You know, if you had the Stadia Pro, you got free games every month, essentially.

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:25.960
But it didn't quite have that same feeling of like a library that you tapped into and all this stuff.

02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:28.880
At least those on the outside weren't seeing it very well.

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:37.960
And I think we all know Google, Google kind of stopped supporting that not long after they released it, unfortunately, as far as the marketing standpoint goes, but

02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:39.640
They announced the closure of Stadia.

02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:41.880
They said, Oh, we're doing our cloud gaming Chromebook.

02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:43.880
And everyone was like, Yeah, fuck off.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.240
Yeah, right. Yeah.

02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:49.560
So, um, but so so where does the industry go from here?

02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:58.560
If a lot of things are going digital, this is exactly why exactly why Diablo four has a $100 collector's edition that doesn't have a copy of the game with it.

02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:11.800
And as dark soccer pointed out limited run, you know, even with the Netflix, the Hulu's, the Disney pluses, etc, of the world, there is still broadcast television.

02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:22.120
There is still blu rays, you know, there's still going to be a demand for some of the old guard because broadcast television excels at live TV.

02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:27.640
I mean, look at what happened when they tried to put Dancing with the Stars on Disney Plus, I think it's lost like half of its viewers.

02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:29.640
And you can't fault Tyra Banks for all of that.

02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:35.160
So I think live TV really excels on the traditional broadcast networks, especially news.

02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:38.560
You can't do news today anyway.

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:44.360
Well, they tried look what happened to CNN plus that came in when as fast as it could, right.

02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:55.520
So anyway, but I do think cloud gaming is also going to be in the future, you know, more and more and I'm not talking like exclusive cloud stuff.

02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:59.600
I'm talking about games that are in part powered by the cloud.

02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:03.720
You've heard about, you know, one of Kojima's games, I don't know if it's Death Stranding 2.

02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:13.080
No, it's not because it's something that's going to be Xbox exclusive, I think, because he was talking about partnering with Microsoft and their cloud is going to be something that probably leverages the cloud.

02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:24.160
So I sort of think a lot of gaming is going digital, whether you like it or not, I don't think the cloud catches on completely until over the air 5g is accessible in more places.

02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:29.520
But I think 10 years from now, yeah, you're going to be looking at cloud gaming being a big part of things.

02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:42.800
How do people get value, either physical trinkets, collector's edition, or somebody figuring out how to develop that system where you can buy and sell digital games, I think is going to be huge for that.

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.520
So, but the industry is evolving.

02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:46.400
Hang on.

02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:47.240
And to agree.

02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:48.000
Yeah.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:54.480
But there's always I mean, you know, not not to be to be a dead horse, but look at the merchandising.

02:06:54.600 --> 02:07:11.320
Yeah, it's like the space balls, merchandising, merchandising, okay, because if you go to Target, I remember when I was a kid, you didn't see an aisle full of video game tie ins, video game merchandising when I was a kid.

02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:17.400
But now you go and there's an aisle that's Fortnite, Minecraft, Five Nights.

02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:22.000
I mean, a lot of these large games get a lot of merchandising.

02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:24.360
Heck, the Mario Legos.

02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:25.440
You know what that is?

02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:26.880
Merchandising.

02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:27.720
Merchandising.

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:32.480
Super Mario World at Hollywood, Universal Hollywood.

02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:33.400
You know what that is?

02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:36.520
An opportunity to sell toilet paper.

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:38.640
Super merchandising.

02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:42.040
So I think you're just going to see a lot of that.

02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:47.280
But that also just has to do with the fact that the kids are grown up now.

02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:48.400
Yeah.

02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:50.960
The kids are grown up now and have kids.

02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:53.680
Video games is a part of our culture.

02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:57.360
It's not a fringe thing that nerds do in their basement.

02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:03.480
There's just as many women as men, if not more, that play video games now.

02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:06.960
So it's it's a part of our culture.

02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:09.720
And so the merchandising makes more sense.

02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:11.520
Because people, yeah.

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:13.200
Sorry, Mike Deft.

02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:14.520
Yes, I got the name wrong in the moment.

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:15.920
It's Super Nintendo World.

02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:17.560
Excuse my beauty.

02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:18.600
All right.

02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:20.600
Thank you for the email.

02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:22.080
I can't see that was a great topic.

02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:22.720
Appreciate it.

02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:24.120
All right.

02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:28.960
If you want to send us an email with a great topic or an average one, that's okay, too.

02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:32.840
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:35.720
Also, I saw some comments in chat.

02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:37.400
So I saw a question in chat here.

02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:39.640
And if I missed your question, please go ahead and restate it.

02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:42.960
But She-Hulk10 asked you a question of our panel tonight.

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:45.000
What do you guys want for Christmas?

02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:48.600
Well, Dark Soccer celebrates Hanukkah, but we'll say-

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:49.800
I take presents.

02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:52.240
Yeah, you'll accept Christmas gifts.

02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:52.680
Sure.

02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:54.880
Well, I've made it abundantly clear what I want.

02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:58.520
Steam wallet so I can get Midnight Suns.

02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:04.240
So what you really want is the hundred dollar Midnight Suns collector's edition.

02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:08.000
That, well, I mean, because it's the season pass and everything.

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.280
I mean, that would be nice.

02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:11.440
But I mean, I'm being realistic.

02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:11.760
Yeah.

02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:14.080
Oh, who am I kidding?

02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:16.880
I'll just use it for RX cells for cosmetics.

02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:19.120
Dead by daylight.

02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:26.960
Which is the whole reason I'm bothering with the whole holiday rift right now.

02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:30.840
Well, I got what I wanted for Christmas.

02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:33.320
I guess I'll go ahead and tell you all what happened.

02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:37.400
So Alan and I exchanged gifts a little early this year

02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:40.000
because he wasn't going to have a way to hide my gift.

02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:41.920
And it showed up.

02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:43.560
It was on it was on sale.

02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:44.800
He had to get it.

02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:47.520
I just haven't built my Tron arcade machine yet,

02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:49.760
but it's sitting downstairs waiting to be made.

02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:50.560
Yep.

02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:52.000
So it's good.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.360
I'm going to have a twin over here,

02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:55.760
and that's part of the reason why I need to spin my office around.

02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:00.360
I really wanted to do it this weekend, but I just I I've been a little sore

02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:04.640
and haven't been able to muster the energy to get all the parts and build them.

02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:05.920
But that'll be something

02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:08.360
I really hope I can do with the holiday break that's coming up.

02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:12.360
So I got what I wanted for Christmas, so I can't complain at all.

02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:15.920
Otherwise, I guess I would like to get a PlayStation five.

02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:16.880
But that can wait.

02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:19.360
That's that's a tall order, and it can wait till early next year.

02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:21.080
Alan and I are going on a cruise.

02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:23.400
We're going on the Star Trek cruise again in late February.

02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:27.720
So I may actually miss two O.L.R.s.

02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:29.800
No, I don't think I do.

02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:33.280
No, the the the cruise is Friday to Friday, so I'll be back on a Saturday.

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:35.400
So I was like, am I going to miss O.L.R. twice?

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:36.920
No, I should only miss it once, actually.

02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:42.040
So that's coming up and got to save money for that, too.

02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:45.520
I mean, the cruise is paid for, but, you know, we want spending money.

02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:47.840
So as you know, Matt says,

02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:50.280
who are the guests that are slated to be on the cruise this year?

02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:53.000
Janeway is back.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.080
Kate Mulgrew is back this year. That's the big name.

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:58.000
I know we get a photo op with a lot of the deep space.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:10:59.680
They get a lot of that.

02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:01.600
They have a lot of the deep space nine cast.

02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:03.640
Both Dax's are there this year.

02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:09.440
But you ask a good question, not Avery Brooks, Brooks, though,

02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:11.440
because he doesn't show up to that stuff. What?

02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:14.960
I need Nicole DeBoer's

02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:18.880
autograph simply and have it said to the one fan of HyperCube

02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:21.360
two of HyperCube.

02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:22.440
She wasn't in HyperCube.

02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:23.960
She's had the first QQ.

02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:25.560
I was just say, I love you.

02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:27.640
But even if it's a little gory, I love the cube.

02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:29.320
So I thought HyperCube.

02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:33.000
No, I that's like what I first knew her from.

02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:37.440
Yeah, same. So I think we do have a photo with the two Dax's

02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:39.440
because I think it's the one that we get included

02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:41.320
for preordering the cruise or whatever.

02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:43.880
So but the only ones we bought

02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:46.920
the other big name that's going on the cruise this year

02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:49.320
and we bought the meet and greet with Doug Jones.

02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:52.400
We had to. We had to. So.

02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:57.040
Well, another thing, too, is that I first knew

02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:00.120
Terry Farrell from Hellraiser three.

02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:02.840
Oh, that's a good one.

02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:05.640
I mean, the movie wasn't great, but that's what I knew her from.

02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:10.760
So Doug Jones is the other big name.

02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:15.880
But we also got a meet and greet with Brent Spiner because we didn't.

02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:19.520
He was on the last cruise, but we didn't get a picture with him or whatever.

02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:20.880
For whatever reason, last time,

02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:23.840
I feel like we ought to buy a meet and greet with Denise Crosby,

02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:26.640
just because the more I see her, the more I love her.

02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:28.720
I just like she was such a highlight of the last cruise.

02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:31.360
So anyway, all those folks are going on the cruise this year.

02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:32.200
And let's see.

02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:35.880
Jonathan Frakes is the other like big name because he wasn't on the year we went.

02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:40.520
Let's see who else is on this year.

02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:42.240
There's a lot of people.

02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:44.920
You can go to Star Trek, the cruise dot com if you want to see the full list.

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:46.960
Robert Duncan McNeil is making it this year.

02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:49.400
He didn't make the other Voyager year we went.

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:52.720
Michelle Heard from the Picard series, just Bush from Picard

02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:54.600
are both going this year as well.

02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:56.520
So, yeah, it's a good it's a good list.

02:12:56.960 --> 02:12:59.920
But I'm just honestly like celebs are one thing.

02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:01.200
I love the people.

02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:02.760
Part of the reason I love the starter crews.

02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:04.640
I'm a dirty casual when it comes to track.

02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:06.240
OK, I haven't seen every series.

02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:08.040
I try, but I just haven't.

02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:09.440
I'm not up to date on everything.

02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:11.560
Here's the thing. It's a great crowd.

02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:14.640
It's 30, 40 and 50 something nerds.

02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:17.400
Shatner is not there this year, thank God.

02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:20.200
So I expect most of the crowd will be a little more progressive.

02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:21.600
Here's and here's the thing.

02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:24.680
Not that I care about a person's political leanings totally,

02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:26.120
but here's the thing.

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:29.240
If Alan and I hold hands on the boat, nobody gives a shit.

02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:32.600
Unfortunately, the reality is most cruises, that's not the case.

02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:38.240
You get a you get a boomer population that still kind of lives in old times

02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:40.680
and has some old ways of thinking.

02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:44.640
So that's part of the reason I like going on the Star Trek cruise, quite frankly.

02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:47.240
And I don't I don't want to go on a gay cruise because

02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:52.080
gay cruises oftentimes are one of two things.

02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:56.320
They're floating circuit parties, which I'm not interested in,

02:13:56.920 --> 02:14:00.720
or they're all lesbians with kids, which is great for that audience.

02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:03.080
Not what I'm looking for in a cruise.

02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:05.760
I'm looking for the nerd cruise. Perfect for me.

02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:10.680
So anyway, Loki, we did not get your what do you want for Christmas?

02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:12.520
Going back to She-Hulk's question.

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:15.920
Oh, I don't know. A few hundred subscribers on YouTube.

02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:18.800
Oh, yeah, I'd like that on Twitch, please.

02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:21.520
It's a fair ask. We want that for VOG Network, too.

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:25.240
Hint hint. So, of course, everyone here, I assume, is already following.

02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:28.160
If you're not, though, consider it. Thank you.

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:30.760
All right. Great questions.

02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:33.720
Let's see, looking in chat for some other questions.

02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:36.040
I don't see any, but I do want to mention this.

02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:39.520
So we are going to be doing a show next week, probably a shorter show,

02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:42.000
but we're going to be here. Next week is Christmas Day.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.960
We don't expect you all are going to be here.

02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:45.800
However, Bobby Black Wolf will be back.

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:47.880
He will be on that night and will be here as well.

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:51.920
We're going to open up the floor to further questions.

02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:54.640
I know we don't always get a lot at the end of the show.

02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:58.520
However, we're going to format the show for December 25th

02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:01.240
a little bit like we did the 20th anniversary show.

02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:03.840
We're going to format it a little bit more like a panel

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.720
where we're going to answer your questions.

02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:07.800
And your questions can be about gaming.

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:09.760
They can be about podcasting.

02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:14.960
They can be about life lessons, whatever you want to ask about within reason.

02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:17.680
DJ Rama S says the return of Ask Orange Lounge?

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:21.680
Pretty much. So whatever you want to ask, within reason.

02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:22.960
This is not Dr. Ruth.

02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:25.640
OK, but as long as I mean, at the same time,

02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:27.160
we could try to fake her accent.

02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:32.320
I would I would blur the line of being offensive if I tried to do that.

02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:34.640
So I don't know, but I love Dr. Ruth too.

02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:38.720
But anyway, I will create a thread and discord after the show.

02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:39.360
If you would like to.

02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:42.000
I was trying to do it during the show, and then I realized, oops,

02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:45.760
Loki and Dark Sakura's faces go away when I switch screens on discord.

02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:49.440
I will make a thread on in the Orange Lounge radio channel on discord

02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:52.280
after the show for you to submit your questions for consideration.

02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:54.600
We probably won't get to everything, but we'll try.

02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:56.880
So we look forward to seeing you next week.

02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:01.520
With that, let me check with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:04.200
Oh, I thought so.

02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:05.320
It's probably a little bit.

02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:08.520
The next two weeks going to be a little slower, and that's OK.

02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:11.080
I should say this is going to be the format of the show

02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:14.840
for the next two weeks, because I anticipate between Christmas and New Year's.

02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:18.760
It's going to be a lot of the best games of 2022.

02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:20.040
And we can talk about that as well.

02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:23.640
But it's not going to be a lot of new news coming out that week.

02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:25.400
Maybe it may be a little bit.

02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:29.360
But we can always do like we know the news is good.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.280
We always used to do like our top games.

02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:35.080
And then we also did like predictions as well.

02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:36.840
Oh, we need to bring that back.

02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:38.280
I agree. Let's do predictions.

02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:41.320
We'll do that on January 1st. That'd be fun.

02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.960
As you know, Matt says, we do have our predictions of 2022 to get to.

02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:46.160
No, we don't. We never did them

02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:48.320
because of the whole virtual situation.

02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:52.000
And always we're doing something else, which is nothing. Yeah.

02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:53.440
So we'll we'll mix it up.

02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:55.640
We don't have a robot sitting on the desk anymore

02:16:56.200 --> 02:17:00.400
because who could have predicted covid, but we'll we'll do this.

02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:07.320
All right. Anyhow, on that note, let's wrap it up for tonight.

02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:10.200
We'll go around and get folks final thoughts and then we'll be done for tonight.

02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:14.240
Dara Sakura, I'm assuming you are doing a post show tonight

02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:16.120
with some Debbie Delight.

02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:19.840
I am. Gwen is as Gwen and I are already partied up

02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:22.200
and we have room for two more to join us.

02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:24.880
If I didn't have to edit,

02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:27.600
I didn't have to edit or get all that done, plus I smell dinner.

02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:30.720
So there'll be time later than that.

02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:32.760
We'll see. We'll see. All right.

02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:35.960
And we're going to just go around

02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:38.000
and jump in snowmen and be ridiculous.

02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:39.480
Sounds like fun.

02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:42.240
Do you have a final look on my Twitter for my Megamis pictures?

02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:44.560
Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:47.680
I was my final thought. Oh, OK.

02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:52.080
Come come play with us and and and and and and give me a dollar.

02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:55.720
All right. Bye, Dara.

02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:58.640
Hi, look, Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:03.800
My final thought is I must still be working on content creation some more.

02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:06.240
It sounds good.

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:07.720
It's going to be all life.

02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:11.160
Yeah, I I definitely want to leverage more tick tock.

02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:14.320
It's just about finding that right thing to talk about

02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:15.600
that I'm very passionate about.

02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:18.440
So and just, you know, sitting down and doing it right.

02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:21.560
It's it's it's it's harder than you think it really is.

02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:26.240
Yeah. Otherwise, my final thought, I don't I don't know.

02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:28.880
Just I hope everybody out there has a good holiday.

02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:33.200
If you are the Hanukkah celebrating sword, I hope you have a good holiday.

02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:35.120
It's starting off well for you.

02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:37.080
If you're the solstice sword, I hope you have a good way.

02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:40.000
You know, even if Christmas sort out, just have a great holiday.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Thank you for being here.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Thank you for making us a part of your weekly routine.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:48.600
I'm just very grateful that we're still here going into our 21st year next year.

02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:53.680
If you can believe it from 2002 to 2023, it'll be our 21st year next year.

02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:55.000
Old enough to drink.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.840
I kind of can't believe it, but it is what it is.

02:18:57.840 --> 02:18:59.880
So thank you so much for being a part of it.

02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:01.600
That's it. That's all I have to say.

02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:03.160
Have a wonderful week, everybody.

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:05.280
Happy holiday. Happy December.

02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:07.560
