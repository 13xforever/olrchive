00:00.000 --> 00:14.360
I'm pretty sure I remember video games being 50 US dollars, yet seeing a $49.99 price tag

00:14.360 --> 00:18.660
in stores seems unfamiliar. I'm of course very acquainted with the $60 price point.

00:18.660 --> 00:22.340
This week, Microsoft stated it's planned to join the $70 club for all of its first-party

00:22.340 --> 00:26.180
titles too, and now two-thirds of console manufacturers and game publishers have made

00:26.180 --> 00:28.340
the Switch. That just leaves the Switch.

00:28.340 --> 00:31.620
This is the intro that references inflation. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts,

00:31.620 --> 00:34.900
Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.700
Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.700 --> 00:45.660
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:45.660 --> 00:52.660
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back at live once again with

00:52.660 --> 01:01.060
episode number 940 of our show tonight, December the 11th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and

01:01.060 --> 01:06.740
I'm here every week with my co-hosts. First off, say hi to Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:06.740 --> 01:12.420
Oh, hello. Hello. I like, you can, you're spotting, I don't think this is a new wig,

01:12.420 --> 01:14.180
but you're spotting a nice looking wig tonight.

01:14.180 --> 01:19.380
It's, it's, I was going to wear the, the, the red lace front, you know, the one I really

01:19.380 --> 01:22.820
like, but I don't know. I just felt like black hair went with green makeup.

01:22.820 --> 01:27.460
It works. It works. I do. I see it on the ice. Well, I know we're talking a lot of visuals,

01:27.460 --> 01:31.700
so sorry to the podcast crowd. We do love you all that subscribe to us as Spotify,

01:31.700 --> 01:36.340
iTunes. Well, don't forget, you know, folks sometimes make clips of the show,

01:36.340 --> 01:42.900
but you can also always access the video archive over at twitch.tv slash vog network because

01:42.900 --> 01:47.060
we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific,

01:47.060 --> 01:52.260
usually right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash

01:52.260 --> 01:56.900
vog network, VOG network. I say usually after Bobby Black Wolf, because he is not,

01:57.540 --> 02:02.500
he wasn't on tonight. He's taking some Bobby time this week, actually some Bobby and Mrs. Bobby time

02:02.500 --> 02:09.860
this week. So they, they are doing some other stuff tonight. So he will be back on December

02:09.860 --> 02:15.220
the 25th. Even though it is a pretty well known holiday, he still plans to be back that night

02:15.220 --> 02:20.420
because I believe as he put it, he does all of his celebrations on the Eve, which may actually

02:20.420 --> 02:23.300
end up being the same thing I do this year. I don't know. We'll see. I'm still trying to

02:23.300 --> 02:29.140
figure that out. So hopefully I'll know for next week because believe it or not, we're two weeks

02:29.140 --> 02:35.780
away from December the 25th. So, and then we're three weeks away from new year's. So it's-

02:35.780 --> 02:37.940
One week away from Hanukkah and that's important.

02:37.940 --> 02:43.060
That is, it's, it's, it's, it's a little more, kind of at the end of December this year,

02:43.060 --> 02:45.540
as opposed to, I think last year it was practically in November, wasn't it?

02:46.260 --> 02:51.700
Yeah. And actually I got something stuck in my head and like got all my stuff out a week early

02:51.700 --> 02:57.300
and then like, oh. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

02:58.340 --> 02:58.900
Hello.

02:58.900 --> 03:03.940
Hi. And that is not a wig. That is all his natural hair, folks. Just so you know. Loki,

03:04.660 --> 03:08.500
I heard Dark Soccer, I think, recognized the game playing behind you tonight. But what is,

03:08.500 --> 03:10.500
what is the game behind you playing tonight? Why?

03:11.300 --> 03:17.140
It is a stall. It is a game from the Saturn. It's one of the first games I played on the Saturn.

03:17.140 --> 03:22.260
And it just, it's like, I remember back then it was like, oh man, it's like an anime. It's

03:22.260 --> 03:27.700
like so amazing. Um, yeah. I mean, it had really cool cut scenes and everything. And it was a

03:27.700 --> 03:32.820
really nice, uh, like 2d platformer. And it flowed. Excellent music. Excellent music.

03:33.540 --> 03:36.660
I just remember being enamored with the backgrounds.

03:37.620 --> 03:39.620
It's all the colors.

03:39.620 --> 03:44.260
It's another one of those games where it's like, we didn't think video game graphics could get any

03:44.260 --> 03:49.380
prettier. And then here we are. I remember the first time I played Mario Brothers 2, actually,

03:49.380 --> 03:53.140
Super Mario Brothers 2, which we all know was a remake of a Japanese game. But you know, I didn't

03:53.140 --> 03:58.420
know that when I was what, 10 years old and that game came out. So, um, when I saw that game for

03:58.420 --> 04:02.660
the very first time, I was like, oh my gosh, it's like a cartoon. I'm playing a cartoon on my TV.

04:03.220 --> 04:07.780
These graphics are so good. Cause remember, you know, my first system was an Atari 2600,

04:07.780 --> 04:14.020
you know, and like many systems of that same era, albeit, you know, Coleco or whatever the graphics

04:14.020 --> 04:17.780
were pretty blocky. I mean, it was cool as hell at the time, because again, it was like, oh,

04:17.780 --> 04:23.060
I'm playing these on my TV at home and not in an arcade. But, uh, like Mario Brothers 2 was the

04:23.060 --> 04:29.380
first time I remember thinking I'm playing a cartoon like legit. So. I mean, to be fair,

04:29.380 --> 04:34.980
like back then the resolution of everything wasn't very big anyways. And, you know, coming

04:34.980 --> 04:39.540
from like playing stuff on like the Atari 2600 or something like that, it's like, yeah, it's a

04:39.540 --> 04:47.860
massive jump in fidelity. So. Well, in a standard TV didn't show much more than 6, 64480. In fact,

04:47.860 --> 04:52.180
I think it was less than that, to be honest. So, uh, I was like 240 and I was like 240. So,

04:52.740 --> 04:58.020
uh, the fact, you know, that it was that perfect revolution for a TV, you know, the NES was just,

04:58.660 --> 05:03.460
yeah, made, made for some incredible graphics. And then when we got to Super Nintendo, oh boy,

05:03.460 --> 05:09.700
like then we really got some cartoon graphics on that one. Yeah. Going to the chat over at

05:09.700 --> 05:15.300
twitch.tv slash vog network. Orange right says that ending in Super Mario Brothers 2 as well.

05:15.300 --> 05:19.380
Oh yeah. You remember that ending in Mario Brothers 2 when you see, you know, Mario sleeping

05:19.380 --> 05:24.820
and like that look when you consider that that's all like sprite based work basically put together

05:24.820 --> 05:28.820
to kind of make that it's really, it was really incredible what they, what they did with that

05:28.820 --> 05:33.940
whole, uh, ending sequence in that game. That looked really, really cool that I loved when

05:33.940 --> 05:39.300
video games had such a rewarding ending like that. Right? Like didn't the Mario Brothers 2 ending

05:39.300 --> 05:43.620
feel really good for that era? Like it was much better than the screen that said,

05:44.260 --> 05:49.380
congratulations. The story is happy and press start to continue. Like it was much,

05:49.380 --> 05:54.100
much more satisfying than something like that. Right. Even though when you beat a hard as hell

05:54.100 --> 06:00.820
game like ghosts and goblins, you'll, you'll take whatever the game gives you. Um, yeah,

06:00.820 --> 06:05.860
as 200 Matt points out, Super Mario Brothers 2 was a dream and Super Mario Brothers 3 was a stage

06:05.860 --> 06:11.620
play. So what would Super Mario Brothers 4 be? The matrix? Because we never really did have a

06:11.620 --> 06:18.180
Mario Brothers 4, although I guess Mario world actually numbered Super Mario 4 at its original

06:18.180 --> 06:22.820
conception. I was going to say Mario world is technically, uh, labeled that, but I guess,

06:22.820 --> 06:28.020
I guess, uh, they didn't actually consider it. It wasn't like part of a show like the others,

06:28.020 --> 06:33.540
I guess. So, uh, anyway, looking for some other comments in chat. Hello. Hello. Uh,

06:33.540 --> 06:37.540
hope everybody's doing well. Uh, dark to see us as I was just about to bring up ghosts and

06:37.540 --> 06:43.300
goblins. So yeah, it's a, it's a memorable ending if nothing else anyway. When it actually ended.

06:44.500 --> 06:49.060
All right, let's move on. We have some gaming news to get into tonight. And of course the big

06:49.060 --> 06:55.140
thing everybody's talking about this week was the game awards because you know, I gotta,

06:55.140 --> 07:01.540
I gotta hand it to Jeff. He did manage to create E3 level kind of announcements in December. Like

07:02.260 --> 07:06.340
there's been good years. There's been not so good years of the game awards. I would say when it

07:06.340 --> 07:11.940
comes to the, the magnitude of the announcements he had planned and the ceremony itself for the

07:11.940 --> 07:16.980
most part, um, I would say it was absolutely one of the better years for the game awards.

07:16.980 --> 07:22.660
Um, definitely some places to improve. I think for me, the running time was really,

07:22.660 --> 07:26.820
remember when he said it wasn't going to be as long as last year and to be fair, it wasn't,

07:28.100 --> 07:34.180
but didn't the steam deck things say they were only going to give away like 150 steam decks

07:34.180 --> 07:38.420
tops or it was like, they were planning for 150 and I think it went, it was about what,

07:38.420 --> 07:40.660
three hours and 15 minutes if you count the free show, right?

07:40.980 --> 07:48.500
Yeah, it was pretty long and that steam deck giveaway thing was kind of, um, it was a mess.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.300
Their player didn't work very well. Cause I actually watched it through that.

07:53.380 --> 07:57.380
Thanks to my internet. I had that playing on one monitor and then I had the 4k version playing on

07:57.380 --> 08:03.780
my main monitor. Right? Yeah. So it was a mess and like, and there is a funny, uh,

08:04.100 --> 08:10.180
Oh God, there's, there's a funny screenshot that's out there. Like the very first one

08:10.820 --> 08:14.820
was like a user by the name of like milf lover or something like that.

08:14.820 --> 08:20.340
Oh yeah. Yeah. One of the first award winners. Yeah. So it was, it was just like

08:21.780 --> 08:25.780
milf Hunter says Mike down Hunter. Oh, you're right. Milf Hunter. Yeah.

08:25.780 --> 08:32.100
So everyone's just like, Oh, GG. And then eventually it like started breaking down

08:32.100 --> 08:36.260
because it stopped showing the names and it started showing the steam ID. So everybody

08:36.260 --> 08:42.020
assumed, Oh, the bots are getting it though. The bots are getting it. It's fun. It was a fun

08:42.020 --> 08:47.140
distraction to watch chat one. Like, you know, I didn't want to watch what was on screen or

08:47.140 --> 08:51.940
anything, but yeah, lots of big announcements and everything. So, um, can I, can I just,

08:51.940 --> 08:55.460
can I speak before we get into the specifics? Can we just kind of speak in some generalities here?

08:55.460 --> 08:59.700
I want to well also, and I want to go to Mike Defton chat who says it went for two hours and

08:59.700 --> 09:04.500
40 something minutes. Does that count the pre-show or not? Because I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:04.500 --> 09:11.860
The pre-show counts for me. Like, because especially when the very first thing they drop

09:11.860 --> 09:17.940
on us is that dead cells, Castlevania. And I'm, I'm actually a little disappointed that that just

09:17.940 --> 09:22.980
isn't a standalone game because when I first saw that I was super hype. I was like, yes,

09:22.980 --> 09:27.860
this is what I want Konami to do. Give your fucking IPs to people that know how to use them.

09:27.860 --> 09:33.300
Dead cell developers, great choice to do something with Castlevania. But it turns out it's

09:33.300 --> 09:38.660
just an expansion for dead cells, which is okay. I'm still interested in that. That's fine. It's a

09:38.660 --> 09:43.940
better direction than, you know, Castlevania probably done in house. But, but that was the

09:43.940 --> 09:48.100
first announcement. And then what then they followed that up with, like, like there was like

09:48.100 --> 09:51.700
some major announcements in that 30 minute little block.

09:52.340 --> 09:54.180
Yeah, there was a new Hellboy game.

09:54.180 --> 09:59.620
Yeah, that was. Sorry, Miltonias Games in chat says pre-show totally counts if it has world

09:59.620 --> 10:04.660
premieres. I that's, that's what I'm saying. And honestly, they just need to fold that into the

10:04.660 --> 10:10.740
main show. Like, let the ostrich lady or flamingo lady, excuse me, let the flamingo lady because

10:10.740 --> 10:17.140
her outfit looked a little flamingo. Let that pre-show get folded into the main show. And she

10:17.140 --> 10:21.940
can still, you know, have her thing. She's been doing that a few years. It should just really be

10:21.940 --> 10:25.140
part of the main show. At this point. I'm not I'm not sure why they call that a pre-show. There

10:25.140 --> 10:30.020
was the news coming out of that was way too big. One other thing I want to get out of the way

10:30.020 --> 10:35.460
because everybody's talking about it. Too many people are talking about it. So it needs to be

10:35.460 --> 10:42.500
addressed. And that is the literal child that got up on stage at the end and said whatever he said,

10:42.500 --> 10:47.220
after Elden Ring won its Game of the Year award, right? We all know he went up there and said,

10:47.860 --> 10:52.900
Bill Clinton, something something, which was interesting because social media immediately

10:52.900 --> 11:00.180
said it was a coded white supremacy message. But unfortunately, social media has a tendency to run

11:00.180 --> 11:07.140
with headline and literal Twitter size thing and not facts. And the fact is that he was a young,

11:07.940 --> 11:12.980
because these these outlets have interviewed him after the fact they're giving him way too much

11:12.980 --> 11:19.940
attention. But whatever it was, here's that attention you ordered. He was a literal child,

11:19.940 --> 11:26.820
15 year Jewish, I believe, IRL shitposter. That's all that was. That was an IRL shitpost.

11:27.540 --> 11:32.260
And the type of behavior you would expect out of a 15 year old child. That's all I'm going to say

11:32.260 --> 11:40.500
about that. Because the onus on that moment, I think goes to Jeff and his security team and all

11:40.500 --> 11:45.460
of that, like, how in the fuck did that kid get up on stage? So many, like, questions in the way

11:45.460 --> 11:51.940
him being Jewish has to do with it. How How did a 15 year old get into the event in the first place?

11:51.940 --> 11:58.980
Where? How did like, I'm assuming he's not from the area. So how did he get to the area to be on

11:58.980 --> 12:02.740
the show? Well, anyone could buy a ticket. They were selling the tickets. Right. But like, you

12:02.740 --> 12:09.380
know, I mean, if my child just disappeared. Oh, yeah, true. Where were the parents? Right? Yeah,

12:10.340 --> 12:14.340
oh, yeah, you're just flying to California. Okay, sure. Bye.

12:16.100 --> 12:20.100
Yeah, that's the thing. And Mike Deaf says, how the fuck did they let that happen at all? It could

12:20.100 --> 12:27.540
have been so worse. Yes, it could have been an actual really bad message that gets out there.

12:27.540 --> 12:35.940
And you know, is is gives the show and gamers in general, a really bad reputation. And that is the

12:35.940 --> 12:40.340
type of unfortunately, shenanigans that and I, you know, Jeff Keeley's pissed that that happened,

12:40.340 --> 12:44.580
especially when he goes out there and he tweets, we arrested the person that did the thing.

12:45.540 --> 12:50.100
And you know, you could see that look on his face just looked like he was just pissed at the end

12:50.100 --> 12:56.180
there. But the reality is, the fact that you let that happen in your security that you contract

12:56.180 --> 13:01.220
with let that happen is what is holding your show back from being the Oscars. Although at the same

13:01.220 --> 13:05.460
time, you look at what happened at the Oscars this past year, and I guess they don't have much

13:05.460 --> 13:13.300
security either. So I'm not sure what this says about award shows at all. Right. Yeah, it's a

13:13.300 --> 13:17.700
weird scenario. And it but it was like, almost like, it was almost nothing, because it's like,

13:18.980 --> 13:23.140
okay, he said something weird, and then he disappeared. Like, and that was it. Like,

13:24.900 --> 13:28.420
I don't know, I didn't even realize it was somebody that wasn't, I thought it was somebody

13:28.420 --> 13:34.260
making a really bad joke. And then like, I didn't understand. I'm like, whatever. People are gonna

13:34.260 --> 13:38.580
be weird, I guess. Yeah, I didn't realize it was like someone that wasn't with the group. And

13:38.580 --> 13:44.020
that's fine. I mean, like, I get it. But like, yeah, it could have been worse. But it was also

13:44.020 --> 13:48.020
really stupid to like, I don't know. Oh, yeah. And that's true. One of Matt brings up a point

13:48.020 --> 13:52.340
and why I addressed it earlier. So when Matt says the reason why the Jewish thing came into play was

13:52.340 --> 13:57.380
because people thought the Bill Clinton thing was a veiled anti Semitic comment. So Jason Schreier

13:57.380 --> 14:03.540
interviewed him in Hebrew, and he understood it, and then pretended not to. So my point was

14:04.100 --> 14:10.100
Yeah, right. It was that Jason Schreier. He's a sneaky, sneaky, sneaky guy. But that was so I

14:10.100 --> 14:15.060
mean, again, it was a good, that's what a journalist does to pull a fast one. Anyway,

14:15.060 --> 14:19.940
but but yeah, but but my point- Oh no, granted, not not everybody understands Hebrew.

14:20.660 --> 14:27.060
But the fact that everybody was running with it was a terrible thing that this child said on

14:27.060 --> 14:33.460
stage. No, it was just a shitpost. But granted, we need to take a moment to realize it could have

14:33.460 --> 14:38.420
been a really bad thing. So anyway, that's all the attention I want to give that it's more than

14:38.420 --> 14:44.180
enough done. The other thing that I think was the big like everybody's talking about it moment was

14:44.180 --> 14:48.660
Christopher Judge's acceptance speech. Now look, I got nothing but love in my heart for Christopher

14:48.660 --> 14:54.020
Judge. He did a great job and God of War Ragnarok. We all know his speech went on a little long.

14:54.660 --> 15:00.260
And this is why the Oscars does a nominees luncheon ceremony to talk about these sorts

15:00.260 --> 15:05.460
of things about keeping it short. I also want to point out something that really struck me

15:05.460 --> 15:10.420
about that speech. And then the subsequent speeches were that they started to raise the

15:10.420 --> 15:16.260
music up on Christopher Judge about five minutes into that speech, where I think the Oscars gives

15:16.260 --> 15:23.060
you about 45 seconds. They started to raise me five minutes. Every subsequent speaker that night,

15:23.060 --> 15:29.940
they started to raise the music a lot faster. That was a little inconsistent. And in my opinion,

15:30.660 --> 15:35.140
kind of didn't look very professional at that point, because they they weren't doing it

15:35.140 --> 15:39.300
consistently. And it looked like they were doing it because of what happened with Christopher Judge.

15:39.860 --> 15:47.300
I just think that was a nobody told him how to do it. So he really just spoke from the heart

15:48.260 --> 15:52.660
and kept speaking and kept speaking. And I understand there's a lot to say.

15:52.660 --> 15:59.860
Look, this bitch and my bitches do a two to three hour show every week about video games. Okay.

15:59.860 --> 16:04.900
Like, I get it. There's sometimes a lot to say. But in the context of these award shows where

16:04.900 --> 16:09.380
you're paying people to be there and so forth, you do have to ask people to tighten it up a

16:09.380 --> 16:15.380
little bit, right, you know, and plan on only the 45 seconds. So again, again, I felt that I felt

16:15.380 --> 16:21.940
that a lot less on Christopher Judge and more on nobody preparing Christopher Judge or any

16:21.940 --> 16:26.900
of the nominees. And then I guess the last thing I could say is the teleprompter seemed to have

16:26.900 --> 16:32.580
problems a couple of times in the night. Al Pacino did not seem to be a fan of the teleprompter.

16:33.300 --> 16:40.740
Roberta Williams, I could see was not enjoying the teleprompter either. But it is what it is.

16:40.740 --> 16:48.340
It's a teleprompter, right? So yeah. Let's see going to some comments in chat. Jessica in chat

16:48.340 --> 16:52.500
says these people always saying something incomprehensible. Whatever happened to just

16:52.500 --> 16:58.260
mooning the audience? I do want to remind that that child was 15. So not that one. But if we're

16:58.260 --> 17:04.020
going to throw back to the Oscars streaker, who was 20 or 30, you know, then that Yeah, whatever,

17:04.020 --> 17:07.860
whatever happened to a good old streaker? Let's let's let's

17:08.100 --> 17:09.780
become desensitized to butts.

17:09.780 --> 17:14.820
Let's how about that? I'd like to put out a challenge. Not really, because I don't want to

17:14.820 --> 17:19.620
get in trouble. But I'd like to put in a fake joke challenge. I want to see a streaker at the

17:19.620 --> 17:24.580
Game Awards 2023. Let's of age please. You know,

17:25.140 --> 17:31.140
I referenced one of my favorite ever things to have ever come out of the Oscars. And it was the

17:31.220 --> 17:35.540
Will Ferrell and Jack Black singing the Get Off the Stage song.

17:36.740 --> 17:39.700
They said, Did you know that the Get Off the Stage song has words?

17:40.820 --> 17:46.580
And I was like, every time I hear any Get Off the Stage music, I just think of them.

17:47.220 --> 17:51.220
It's like the look at Catherine Zeta Jones. She's snoring.

17:51.220 --> 17:56.580
Yeah, yeah. So that's the whole thing. If they gave lyrics to it, I bet everyone would would

17:56.580 --> 17:58.740
actually get off the stage and just listen to the song.

17:58.740 --> 18:02.580
I would worry about a comedy bit at the Game Awards, though. Well, I guess they sometimes

18:02.580 --> 18:07.940
do like, they did like the animal thing, which was cute. Like, I'm always going to have room

18:07.940 --> 18:12.740
in my heart for a Muppets moment. But it really just made me go, I wish the Muppets would host

18:12.740 --> 18:16.180
the Game Awards. Not that I have a problem with Geoff Keighley. But I just feel like the whole

18:16.180 --> 18:21.140
thing would just have more pep in it if the Muppets hosted, you know, like, Geoff Keighley

18:21.140 --> 18:25.860
does feel a little vanilla at this point. And I don't know a nice way to say it. I'm not trying

18:25.860 --> 18:30.740
to be mean. Again, I liked this award show a lot more than most of the others. It's just,

18:30.740 --> 18:33.780
I feel like a little spice it up a little bit.

18:34.500 --> 18:34.900
I don't know.

18:34.900 --> 18:39.700
It also feels weird to have like Animal there without like, it tying into like, literally

18:39.700 --> 18:40.500
anything.

18:40.500 --> 18:44.740
Yeah, that's like, where was Miss Piggy unavailable? I mean, but again, I like Animal,

18:44.740 --> 18:50.100
but it did seem like why that particular Muppet? I don't know. Where's the love for Janice and her

18:50.100 --> 19:00.420
band? Or like, if we're gonna do some deep cut and Muppets. Let's get Scooter and Skeeter out

19:00.420 --> 19:03.220
there to reaffirm that they are indeed Muppet babies.

19:06.020 --> 19:12.100
All right. Yeah, that's a good one. Orangewright and Chet says, people on Mastodon were saying,

19:12.100 --> 19:16.660
where were Statler and Waldorf? Now those are the Muppets I want to see at the Game Awards.

19:16.660 --> 19:17.940
Yes. Yes.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.580
Because they knew they'd have nothing nice to say.

19:23.220 --> 19:23.860
That's great.

19:24.580 --> 19:28.900
Then they just need to start like piping up when people take too long with their speeches.

19:28.900 --> 19:29.380
Yeah.

19:29.380 --> 19:30.180
Ripping into them.

19:31.060 --> 19:35.220
You hear the small voice from the balcony. Boo! Move! Leave!

19:36.420 --> 19:39.700
I would never do that, Chris, for Judge, though. But Questbuster says-

19:39.700 --> 19:40.260
You know what I mean.

19:40.260 --> 19:44.260
Yeah. Questbuster says, I'm sure Judge as an actor for years knew that he was running the

19:44.260 --> 19:48.420
clock, but he was so emotionally invested in the moment alongside someone who was probably one of

19:48.420 --> 19:52.660
the reasons for him getting into the craft in the first place. Oh, for sure. Again, I'm not really

19:52.660 --> 19:58.500
faulting Christopher Judge in that scenario. I'm faulting what I believe or what I'm interpreting

19:58.500 --> 20:04.980
was a lack of preparing Christopher Judge to say to all the nominees, okay, if you get selected,

20:04.980 --> 20:08.980
you get a chance to go up on stage. Think about what you want to say in a minute. We have to limit

20:08.980 --> 20:12.420
you to a minute, but we'll allow you to make a further statement online if you want to do that

20:12.500 --> 20:17.140
at thegameawards.com, and we'll publish it on Twitter. But when you get 50 seconds in your

20:17.140 --> 20:20.260
speech, you're going to hear the music come up, and that is the sign that we need you to wrap it

20:20.260 --> 20:24.260
up. And then at a minute 15, we're going to take- like they need to just outline, this is how it's

20:24.260 --> 20:30.900
going to go. And I don't think anybody did that. They need to make sure that they don't do it via

20:30.900 --> 20:37.460
email, that they give them a physical card. That actually is a brilliant call out, because you're

20:37.460 --> 20:43.460
right, it might have been in an email. I mean, people will gloss over email, and I bet anyone

20:43.460 --> 20:48.340
who has any certain amount of notoriety is probably going to have people that check their

20:48.340 --> 20:56.100
mail for them. Yeah, yeah. So I think that it needs to be sent out in a formal card. A card on

20:56.100 --> 21:05.220
laminated. Something, an easy text, something that's eye-catching that says, here's how not to

21:05.220 --> 21:09.940
be a shit. Do you think Jeff is- Do you think Jeff is going to send Christopher Judge an email

21:09.940 --> 21:13.700
on Monday that says, per my last email? No.

21:16.500 --> 21:21.380
Miltonius Games in chat says, this email should have been a meeting. Yes, that's why the Oscars

21:21.380 --> 21:25.460
do a nominee's lunch, and that's when they talk about all that stuff. They buy them lunch at

21:25.460 --> 21:29.380
least. So I think- They should have bought them lunch. Yeah, they should have bought them lunch.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.940
Exactly. Come on. There's-

21:31.940 --> 21:35.300
I would listen to people who give me free food.

21:35.300 --> 21:40.100
That's right. There's my suggestion for the Game Awards 2023. I want to see a streaker,

21:40.100 --> 21:47.060
and I want to see the nominees get bought lunch. All right. Okay, Loki, let's get into the weeds.

21:47.060 --> 21:49.220
What were some of the other announcements of the Game Awards?

21:50.340 --> 21:55.060
So anyways, again, I mentioned that there was a new Hellboy game based off the comics,

21:55.060 --> 22:02.340
so Web of Word. And there's- Was it the announcement that Vampire Survivors is going

22:02.340 --> 22:06.340
free on mobile, which is pretty cool. That was kind of a random surprise,

22:06.340 --> 22:10.580
but I'm excited to see that. We got another look at Horizon

22:10.580 --> 22:15.220
Call the Mountain, which looks pretty cool. I can't wait to check that out at some point.

22:15.940 --> 22:18.580
Post Trauma, which kind of looks like Silent Hill.

22:20.260 --> 22:23.940
I literally thought it was a Silent Hill thing, and I was like, didn't Konami already put their

22:23.940 --> 22:30.900
cards on the table? Maybe that's the one that got rejected Silent Hill,

22:30.900 --> 22:34.660
and so they decided to do something different with what they built. Sometimes that happens.

22:35.540 --> 22:38.660
Well, not waste the assets. Not waste the time, yeah.

22:39.940 --> 22:45.460
Viewfinder, which is a game that allows you to kind of alter the world with a camera.

22:45.460 --> 22:48.020
And so it kind of- There's another one that's just-

22:48.020 --> 22:52.340
I swear to God, I played a game like this at the Pop Culture Museum when I was in Seattle,

22:52.340 --> 22:56.660
because you know they have an indie game room, right? And there was a game I played that was-

22:57.300 --> 23:00.740
Sorry, I don't remember the name, but it was very much that same thing where it was like,

23:00.740 --> 23:05.540
you look around in a picture, and then when you line it up the right way, it kind of turns into

23:05.540 --> 23:10.580
something else. You turn it into a different thing. There's an indie game very similar to

23:10.580 --> 23:15.220
this. And I honestly thought I was looking at a trailer for the indie game coming to PS5 or

23:15.220 --> 23:19.860
something. Yeah, there's one like that where you can also grab objects and it changes size based

23:19.860 --> 23:25.460
off of like perspective or something like that, which is kind of weird. Atomic Heart,

23:25.460 --> 23:32.340
which looks pretty cool. It's kind of like almost like a Fallout or- I'm trying to think of the

23:32.340 --> 23:37.620
other one that was like Fallout, but it's not. I can't remember it, but I did play it and I love

23:37.620 --> 23:44.500
that game. But that looks pretty cool. There was Scars Above, which is like a sci-fi action shooter

23:44.500 --> 23:52.580
game. Relic Hunters Legend, some online looter shooter. Among Us is getting a new hide and seek

23:52.580 --> 24:00.420
mode. That looked pretty fun. They had that, was it After Us, which is like some sort of

24:00.980 --> 24:07.220
platformer environmental type game thing. Oh, that reminded me of one you skipped over during

24:07.220 --> 24:11.860
the pre-show or you said it so fast I missed it. Yeah, yeah. Returnal on PC. That got me very

24:11.860 --> 24:17.220
excited. Just saying. Haven't gotten there yet. Oh, my bad. I thought that was during the pre-show.

24:18.340 --> 24:20.900
This is all still I think pre-show. Oh, shit. All right. My bad.

24:21.460 --> 24:30.180
Yeah. So, Replaced, which was a sci-fi platformer. Then there's also, they had another

24:30.180 --> 24:35.780
trailer for Street Fighter 6, which is they announced there's going to be a 2v2 mode and

24:35.780 --> 24:39.860
I think it's also supposed to be coming out in June now. I think they did date it. Yeah,

24:39.860 --> 24:44.980
it looks real good. I got to say, yeah, like there's something about those even numbered

24:44.980 --> 24:51.460
Street Fighters. And then I think this is getting into the show now. I know Hades 2, I think was

24:51.460 --> 24:56.420
the first game that they announced at the show, which looked fantastic. That was huge because

24:56.420 --> 25:02.020
Supergiant Games, haven't they said they don't make sequels in the past? And here we go. I mean,

25:02.020 --> 25:06.340
but if any game does, I mean, honestly, all of their games could stand to have a sequel.

25:07.140 --> 25:13.780
But Hades like double so. And Shane is in chat on time saying Hades 2 was the only thing that

25:13.780 --> 25:18.020
mattered. I would disagree with the only thing that mattered, but I would say it was a genuine

25:18.020 --> 25:22.900
surprise. It didn't get leaked in advance. And it was one of those things that definitely led way,

25:22.900 --> 25:27.780
especially the fact that it was at the beginning and was a surprise. It's just like the beginning

25:27.780 --> 25:33.620
hour of the pre-show plus the first part of the show just felt like, damn, like they really are

25:33.620 --> 25:36.820
coming out swinging this year. And then unfortunately we got to the last hour of the

25:36.820 --> 25:40.660
show. It wasn't that it was bad, but it was all kinds of stuff they kind of told you we would see

25:40.660 --> 25:47.300
like Final Fantasy 16 and that stuff. So, but anyway, Hades 2, I'm all about that. It looks

25:47.300 --> 25:51.460
great. I like that they're kind of changing it up and making it about Hades. I think it's Hades

25:51.460 --> 25:58.660
sister, right? But they'll still have, you know, the gorgeous gods and goddesses art, but it looks

25:58.660 --> 26:04.740
like generally the gameplay will sort of be similar. So, yeah. Yeah. And then we have the

26:04.740 --> 26:10.980
new Ken Levine game, uh, which looks like Bioshock, but is not Judas. It looks all

26:10.980 --> 26:16.660
spacey and kind of crazy. And I'm all about that. It's very much a spiritual successor.

26:16.660 --> 26:21.140
Sorry. Shane says it's Zagreus' sister, not Hades. I, I did that thing where I said the

26:21.140 --> 26:26.580
main character. I said, I said, uh, uh, Zelda is the one you play as in Legend of Zelda. I

26:26.580 --> 26:31.140
had a moment like that. Sorry. So, but yes, Zagreus' sister, so the main character sister

26:31.140 --> 26:36.500
in the game. But yeah, Judas looks fantastic. Uh, then suddenly out of literally nowhere,

26:36.500 --> 26:41.540
uh, Bayonetta Origins, uh, Sariza and the Lost Demon, which looks.

26:42.740 --> 26:48.100
Okay. I have something to say about that. The Bayonetta spinoff game. So remember when all

26:48.100 --> 26:54.340
the Helena Taylor stuff went down a couple months ago, I just want to point out at that time I said

26:54.980 --> 26:58.900
Nintendo and Platinum are going to be pissed at her because she just told you they're working on a

26:58.900 --> 27:03.540
Bayonetta spinoff game. Now, to be fair, this is not the spinoff game I imagined. I thought they

27:03.540 --> 27:07.060
were doing it with maybe some of the other characters in the mainline series and so forth,

27:07.060 --> 27:11.940
but Helena Taylor told you they were working on a Bayonetta spinoff game. Because remember when

27:11.940 --> 27:17.620
she said with it, with me or anybody else doing Bayonetta or something that she, she was using

27:17.620 --> 27:23.940
this language about, you know, what, what types of games they do, or if they spin Bayonetta off into

27:23.940 --> 27:30.740
a series and all this stuff. Like, so Helena Taylor kind of spoiled this game, but not really

27:30.740 --> 27:35.300
because who could have predicted it was basically a different genre of game and a different art

27:35.300 --> 27:40.100
style. It's interesting that the Bayonetta franchise is now at a point where it is making,

27:40.100 --> 27:44.020
which is a great thing, but it's making these different like spinoff game types. It's just,

27:44.020 --> 27:51.140
it's interesting. Yeah. And we got a couple more new trailers for, uh, Destiny 2 Late Fall and then

27:51.540 --> 27:57.620
Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League, um, which looks interesting. They confirmed with the latter

27:57.620 --> 28:03.220
one that Kevin Conroy is going to be voicing Batman in that as well. It was his last performance.

28:05.220 --> 28:09.860
Got a trailer for a Star Wars Jedi Survivor, which looks pretty cool.

28:10.500 --> 28:14.580
Some of my friends that are really into Star Wars were like losing their minds. It did look really

28:14.580 --> 28:19.060
like, you know, I'm, I'm, I appreciate Star Wars. I think that's a good word. I don't know if I would

28:19.060 --> 28:22.820
say like I'm a hardcore fan, but I appreciate Star Wars. And I could see that like the,

28:23.620 --> 28:29.140
the putting together that trailer, that whole moment with, uh, what, what's the actor's name,

28:29.140 --> 28:32.260
Cameron Monaghan or whatever that came out with the lightsaber and everything. Like they just,

28:32.260 --> 28:38.020
they put that whole moment together very well for those fans. Yeah. Um, and then we have a new game

28:38.020 --> 28:44.020
by the creators of Celeste that called Earthblade, which looks pretty awesome, kind of a similar

28:44.020 --> 28:51.860
style game as well. Um, another trailer for Duke or Duke Dune awakening, no Duke Nukem game for

28:51.860 --> 28:58.020
a man, Duke Nukem awakening. It's surprised to see this in the middle of this show. I thought

28:58.020 --> 29:01.860
this would be something that kept towards the end, but we got the announcement of Death Stranding 2,

29:02.740 --> 29:12.260
which Kojima finally shit. Yay. Refer to last week's show if you need to, but, uh, yeah. Uh,

29:12.900 --> 29:16.980
no, it was, it was not, you know, it was nice to see that all confirmed, especially,

29:16.980 --> 29:22.100
uh, with the rumors about Overdoser going around as well. Like it's nice to see like what,

29:22.100 --> 29:27.860
like what actresses are, you know, are in the Death Stranding 2, what that all kind of looks like.

29:27.860 --> 29:33.220
Um, I mean, obviously it still didn't make any damn sense, but neither did the first one.

29:33.220 --> 29:36.180
It made a lot more sense when she got in there and played it. So, you know, I'm,

29:36.180 --> 29:41.620
I'm assuming the second one will be very similar. I'm just curious if the second game is going to

29:41.700 --> 29:46.820
play like the first game or is he trying to make it more actiony this time? I don't, I don't know.

29:46.820 --> 29:51.540
I don't know. So we'll kind of have to see. Uh, we got a trailer for Tekken 8,

29:51.540 --> 30:00.020
which looks like Tekken 8. Uh, yeah. Uh, Mortals of Avium, which, uh, is I guess a,

30:01.380 --> 30:06.180
it's a game from Ascendant Studios who is comprised of people that worked on Call of

30:06.180 --> 30:12.900
Duty and Dead Space. It's a first person magic based shooter game. So Hexen type of game, I

30:12.900 --> 30:23.140
guess. Um, Nightingale, which looked, uh, kind of interesting. And, um, let's see Ballers Gate 3,

30:23.940 --> 30:30.500
which was kind of surprising. Uh, Wayfinder, which was a online free to play action RPG game.

30:31.380 --> 30:35.780
Uh, Diablo 4, I wasn't even paying attention to this trailer, but yeah,

30:35.780 --> 30:40.020
we got a trailer for Diablo 4 and release date I think.

30:40.020 --> 30:45.380
It looked, I mean, it's just a cinema cut scene. It had none, none of the actual gameplay was in

30:45.380 --> 30:52.580
it. It was all just a hype for a release date, but, um, yeah, Diablo 4 looks really good. And

30:52.580 --> 30:55.700
there's been, there was a press preview that happened this last week. And a lot of folks

30:55.700 --> 31:01.780
are coming out saying, you know, it, uh, plays, um, like it has some of the best parts of two

31:01.780 --> 31:05.380
and then some of the modernizations of three kind of all mishmashed together.

31:05.380 --> 31:10.660
And some of the early, uh, impressions there are pretty favorable and, uh, you know, not,

31:10.660 --> 31:16.500
not that, not that I, I mean, if, if I had played Diablo 4, I, I wouldn't be able to talk about it.

31:16.500 --> 31:21.700
Um, but, uh, I, if I'd played Diablo 4, I bet my impressions would have been pretty favorable too,

31:22.260 --> 31:24.100
but I guess we'll never know.

31:26.660 --> 31:33.780
Um, horizon forbidden West burning shores. It's a DLC for horizon, uh, for Ben West

31:33.780 --> 31:41.300
taking place in Los Angeles. So we get the Hollywood sign, uh, fire emblem engage.

31:41.300 --> 31:46.260
It's a new fire emblem game. And I have as little interest in that as I do all the other fire emblem

31:46.260 --> 31:53.940
games, um, blue protocol and action MMO. That's supposed to be coming out next year by Ben

31:53.940 --> 32:02.020
dynamic and Amazon games. So we'll see, um, transformers reactivate. It's a transformers game.

32:02.980 --> 32:05.860
That was a wild trailer for a transformers game.

32:05.860 --> 32:09.140
I honestly thought it might've been a Titan fall game when I, you know,

32:09.780 --> 32:13.620
Oh, good call. Yeah. But then, then it was transfer. I was like, Oh,

32:14.340 --> 32:19.140
Oh man, Titanfall three would have been a great announcement, but for whatever reason,

32:19.140 --> 32:24.020
no, we got another, uh, another scene from the super Mario brothers movie. This is like

32:24.020 --> 32:29.620
something that was comprised of stuff that was in some of the other international TV spots as well.

32:29.620 --> 32:34.900
Plus there was some new footage to it as well. Um, but it's funny, I guess. I don't know. I still

32:34.900 --> 32:40.420
want to see it. The footage was cute and, you know, it, it, it kind of sold to me the same

32:40.420 --> 32:46.020
thing that that second trailer did. And that is that the, the movie was definitely animated and

32:46.020 --> 32:50.580
directed by people that really understand and have a love for the Mario to universe.

32:50.580 --> 32:55.620
Cause there's a lot of deep Nintendo and in general catch like a lot of stuff like they're

32:55.620 --> 32:59.700
talking about, like the antiques or whatever it's like, is this thing still working? Well, yeah,

32:59.700 --> 33:05.140
you got to blow it in a little bit. Oh, I didn't even catch that. That's funny, but yeah, no,

33:05.140 --> 33:09.220
there's a lot of, there's a lot of deep, there's a lot of deep cuts, like just all over that.

33:09.220 --> 33:14.020
And so, yeah, I just don't, I hope that's honestly, I hope that's the only clip we see

33:14.580 --> 33:18.580
sometimes with these movies, they release so many clips online and they'll, they'll all be

33:18.580 --> 33:22.580
over social media. And it's like, I will have seen half the movie cause of clips on social media.

33:22.580 --> 33:28.180
And it's like, honestly, let it be a surprise at this point. I you've shown enough. I I've come

33:28.180 --> 33:33.620
around. I've got, I, at the beginning I was like, eh, I'll watch it on video, but now I'm like,

33:33.620 --> 33:36.020
all right, I'll go see it in the theater. I want to see it. It's cute.

33:36.020 --> 33:44.020
Uh, we got a trailer for a game called remnant to, uh, remnant from the ashes sequel, I guess,

33:44.900 --> 33:54.580
um, behemoth. It's a meta quest VR game. They can let you be a Viking. That's neat, I guess.

33:55.300 --> 34:04.020
Um, banishers ghost of new Eden. I'm not really sure exactly what type of game it is,

34:04.020 --> 34:10.820
but it looks cool. Kind of game of thrones ish. Uh, Warhammer 40 K space Marine too.

34:11.380 --> 34:17.620
Uh, it looks pretty awesome. Uh, meet your maker was kind of a neat little thing. So it's a game

34:17.620 --> 34:23.220
rebuild like outposts, I guess. And then, uh, other people raid your outposts and you have

34:23.220 --> 34:32.740
to put traps and stuff in them. So that's kind of cool. Uh, it's not exactly home alone with

34:32.740 --> 34:37.940
it's like, yeah, Warhammer meets home alone. That's what I'm just imagining now, Kevin,

34:37.940 --> 34:47.060
with the tank, um, crash team rumble, which I know has made some people, especially in my

34:47.060 --> 34:54.420
circle, um, very happy. So a new, uh, four V four, uh, game that's kind of out of nowhere there.

34:54.420 --> 35:04.420
Um, Lords of the fallen is got another trailer and it does look pretty cool. The one that had

35:04.420 --> 35:11.700
me surprised, and this may buy maybe my new love instead of saints row, but crime boss rock case

35:11.700 --> 35:18.740
city. It is the game by the folks that put together the, uh, payday series. And it is

35:19.380 --> 35:26.900
got a, like a really like triple a actor cast and stuff in it. And Danny Glover, Michael Madsen,

35:26.900 --> 35:31.380
there was a lot of, uh, okay. But yeah, it can base here. Okay. But Loki, do you know what I

35:31.380 --> 35:40.740
called that game? Grand theft boomer. Cause it is all like all it's a list actors and actresses,

35:40.740 --> 35:47.700
but they are all over the age of 60, which is what I'm totally fine with. It's fine, but I'm sorry,

35:47.700 --> 35:53.380
it's grant that boomers, but it's, it's, I mean, I, I, they're pretty good too. Like I've watched

35:53.380 --> 35:58.340
gameplay of it and it looks fantastic. If you go to the orange lounge radio list of dream games,

35:58.340 --> 36:03.540
I believe many hundred episodes ago, we put a dream game on there called grandma's got a gun

36:03.540 --> 36:09.460
and you know what, Kim Basinger here's her moment. So grant that boomer it is. Um,

36:10.660 --> 36:14.900
and Oh yeah. Shane does point out since when is vanilla ice and a list actor?

36:14.900 --> 36:20.580
Well, there were other A-list actors in there and, and, and vanilla more Michael Rooker, but,

36:20.580 --> 36:29.780
you know, it's fine. I, I'm, it does remind me of like a San Andreas or, you know, like one of the

36:29.780 --> 36:36.340
earlier, uh, saints road games where they did have like big name Hollywood actors voicing the

36:36.340 --> 36:42.100
characters in there. And, um, I'm all about that, especially since saints road just doesn't know

36:42.100 --> 36:48.500
what it wants to be anymore. So bye-bye. Um, so there's an announcement of Call of Duty's raid

36:48.500 --> 36:55.540
mode, uh, that's coming out, uh, cyberpunk new DLC. So cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty,

36:55.540 --> 37:01.620
starring Idris Alda, which looks pretty fantastic. Another person who could read me the phone book.

37:01.620 --> 37:04.980
I know. I'm glad they brought him in to get people interested in that game again.

37:05.780 --> 37:08.580
I think there'll be a lot of people giving that game a second chance.

37:09.540 --> 37:11.940
Um, armored course six.

37:11.940 --> 37:12.980
That was a surprise.

37:13.780 --> 37:16.980
I thought for sure this was good. Yeah. I didn't know that was an armor. Well,

37:16.980 --> 37:20.820
I knew about halfway through the trailer as an armored core game, but I thought it would be

37:21.620 --> 37:26.740
kind of cool, like an armored core dark souls type game. Like, you know, make it that kind

37:26.740 --> 37:32.420
of hard, but armored core, but it sounds like it's going to be an dark or a armored court,

37:32.420 --> 37:40.260
Elden ring type game. So either way, I felt like you were quaking. When I saw that trailer,

37:40.260 --> 37:45.460
I was like, Loki is shaking and crying somewhere about this. It looked pretty awesome. I was like,

37:45.460 --> 37:52.100
Oh yes. Yeah. Um, and then Final Fantasy 16 looks pretty cool. I still don't know what the hell's

37:52.100 --> 37:57.860
going on in that, but it looks cool. I just don't like the combat though. Like I'm such an old

37:57.860 --> 38:04.100
person, but like I really, the action combat stuff in there just turns me so off of these games. I,

38:04.100 --> 38:08.500
I really miss the old Final Fantasy combat system, but I'll try it again.

38:10.260 --> 38:13.540
I caught Odin in the new trailer and that made me happy. Cause I didn't,

38:13.540 --> 38:17.060
didn't see that Odin was one of the, whatever they're calling him.

38:18.340 --> 38:20.660
Espers summons, whatever they call them in this one.

38:21.460 --> 38:25.220
Why do we have to change it every single time? Just keep the same names.

38:25.220 --> 38:30.260
That's what they do. Um, so, and that was that, that was, that was kind of,

38:30.260 --> 38:35.380
I gotta say though, that was a weird thing to put last. No, I mean, I get there's a ton of hype

38:35.380 --> 38:38.980
around 16 and so forth, but it was just, it was a weird thing to put last because we already knew

38:38.980 --> 38:44.500
it was coming. So I'm surprised, like you, I'm kind of surprised that and the Death Stranding

38:44.500 --> 38:47.940
2 thing didn't flip, although let's be real. We all knew Death Stranding 2 was coming too,

38:47.940 --> 38:51.220
but maybe the armored core thing honestly is strong enough to have been the last,

38:51.860 --> 38:55.620
especially with Elden Ring winning game of the year, you know, another From Software

38:55.620 --> 39:01.700
venture being the last announcement I think would have, would have been worthy of that. So.

39:02.260 --> 39:02.820
For sure.

39:02.820 --> 39:06.660
Yeah. So how are we feeling about the game awards overall? Like,

39:06.660 --> 39:09.860
what would you want to see different next year? If anything.

39:10.580 --> 39:11.060
Shorter.

39:13.060 --> 39:18.740
How do we get there though? I wonder if we can get shorter at this point. I do feel like.

39:18.740 --> 39:20.740
It's its own version of the daytime Emmys.

39:20.740 --> 39:25.380
I that's in some regards, it's actually not a bad idea.

39:25.380 --> 39:29.540
I think the reason the length is what it is is because they're using a lot of this as

39:29.540 --> 39:34.180
advertising to pay for the whole thing in the first place as well. So like, I don't know if

39:34.180 --> 39:38.660
you necessarily need to make it shorter and I'm fine with it being as long as it is. That's fine.

39:38.660 --> 39:43.300
Cause if you don't want to watch it, you can just catch the highlights the following day. I mean,

39:43.300 --> 39:49.540
or even just after it, I mean, it's not a big deal. Um, I think it's fine. I think it's fine

39:49.540 --> 39:54.580
as it is. There are things that are unnecessary that feel like, like what the hell is animal

39:54.580 --> 39:59.140
doing there? Like that doesn't make any goddamn sense. Like, I don't know what, what that was

39:59.140 --> 40:04.020
about other than, okay, I want this to happen. Yeah. I think there's just a few things they

40:04.020 --> 40:09.940
have to tighten up. I understand they gave away a lot of awards at rapid pace too, but, um, it's

40:09.940 --> 40:13.140
fine. I actually kind of liked Jamie's idea though. Cause a lot of people were saying

40:14.100 --> 40:18.580
you have enough to fill up two nights and I almost wonder if maybe some of those pre-show

40:18.580 --> 40:22.980
announcements shouldn't go into some type of technical award show. That's a lunchtime show

40:22.980 --> 40:27.540
that happens, you know, the day before or a couple of days before or something. I almost wonder if

40:27.540 --> 40:35.940
there isn't enough here to have two, two award shows, but like one is obviously a little more

40:35.940 --> 40:39.300
like, you know, the one you're pushing people towards than the other, but then at the same time

40:39.300 --> 40:43.060
you don't want to cut away from the other. So maybe brand, I know people are saying winter

40:43.060 --> 40:48.500
game Fest, but maybe just, you know, have, have the whole thing branded as game awards.

40:48.500 --> 40:54.820
And maybe it could be like Wednesday is the technical game awards. Thursday is the public

40:54.820 --> 40:59.140
ceremony game awards featuring game of the year. And, you know, have it be two ceremonies. I really

40:59.140 --> 41:05.780
think there is enough to justify that at this point. So yeah. Yeah. Um, she hold 10 and chat

41:05.780 --> 41:11.540
says show more winners and less trailers. You know, I think a lot of people hesitate to say

41:11.540 --> 41:18.420
show less announcements, but I actually think it could stand to curate the announcements a

41:18.420 --> 41:24.260
little more. I'm not sure if everything necessitated the time it was given. And I know that

41:24.260 --> 41:29.780
sounds really terrible, but especially I'm going to give an example, a game that was already

41:29.780 --> 41:36.500
announced last year. That's giving a gameplay update should really get minimal space. Um,

41:36.500 --> 41:42.660
if that, if not relegated to a prior award show, I think they need to curate a little more what

41:42.660 --> 41:49.940
they're putting into this. But at the same time, you need, you know, all those ad dollars, you

41:49.940 --> 41:54.660
need to sell so many ad blocks. So you need things to fill that space. And if it wasn't announcements,

41:54.660 --> 41:58.740
then we'd be bitching about lame comedy bits or musical performances. So I understand it's,

41:58.740 --> 42:03.700
it's a very tricky navigational game that Jeff has to place. But despite all this, you know,

42:03.700 --> 42:06.900
feedback, it sounds like I'm just complaining, complaining, and playing about it. Actually,

42:06.900 --> 42:12.260
I again, I feel like this was one of the better shows. This show is on a good path. They just

42:12.260 --> 42:17.300
need to fix security, fix some of these logistical things. And I think it's going to be in a great

42:17.300 --> 42:24.580
spot next year. But I, but yeah, I mean, there's just, you know, a few things just glare out.

42:24.580 --> 42:28.580
That's it. Yeah. And SGA 100 Matt says they actually did show less trailers this year. It,

42:29.140 --> 42:32.260
it didn't feel like it. I'm just keeping it real. It didn't feel like it.

42:33.700 --> 42:42.340
bonds 006 says the past year highlights on Wednesday and the actual award on Thursday.

42:44.020 --> 42:49.860
Ooh, I like Miltonius game suggestion, a gamer's choice night. And then the critics night. That

42:49.860 --> 42:54.980
might be a way to split some things up to you could do those esport related awards and, you

42:54.980 --> 42:59.940
know, streamer of the year and some of that could be in the gamer's choice night. You know, some of

42:59.940 --> 43:04.580
those things that I really like that idea. That's a good one. So I think, I think he should look at

43:04.580 --> 43:08.740
splitting the show a little bit. Um, and I know, you know, again, people watch three days straight

43:08.740 --> 43:13.460
of E3. They'll watch two game award announcement shows, you know, if they're, if it's done well.

43:14.020 --> 43:23.300
So, all right. Any last thoughts before we move on? Has anybody preordered, bought or whatever,

43:23.300 --> 43:31.380
anything as a result of the show? Nope. I will definitely, uh, put Hades two on early access.

43:31.380 --> 43:37.140
That's for sure. So I can play that on steam and then I'm probably gonna pre-order or pre-purchase

43:37.140 --> 43:41.860
because now that's the thing we do now is pre-purchase, but for Diablo four, I'll do it.

43:41.860 --> 43:47.380
So I've just, that's always been my favorite Blizzard franchise and my faith in four is very

43:47.380 --> 43:54.820
strong. So, uh, I, I, I will pre-purchase it. So, all right, let's move on and talk about

43:55.380 --> 43:59.940
instead of things we plan to, Oh yes. Mike Deaf says I will get Street Fighter six on launch

43:59.940 --> 44:06.740
though. I think I was already sold on six, but now I'm like really sold. So yeah. All right. Uh,

44:06.740 --> 44:10.020
let's get into our gaming weeks. Not the things we're looking for, looking forward to,

44:10.020 --> 44:14.740
but the things we've already played. Uh, Dar Sakura, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?

44:15.380 --> 44:24.100
It was the same way it usually is for me. Um, I, uh, I beat Cult of the Lamb and I'm going to still

44:24.100 --> 44:30.020
be playing it a little bit more just to see if I can do some completion on it. Um, I don't want

44:30.020 --> 44:37.700
to spoil the ending, but I, uh, I made a special recruitment as my decision. Um, I of course played,

44:37.700 --> 44:43.140
uh, lots of Dead by Daylight, some off stream. I actually played with one of my newer friends,

44:43.220 --> 44:52.500
Raven McPherse. Um, we played for a long time last night. Um, and, uh, Oh yeah. Final Fantasy

44:52.500 --> 44:56.980
five. I thought I had beaten the game and I had forgotten there's more game after the first, uh,

44:56.980 --> 45:04.020
big X death battle. So oops, more game. Um, more deathing, more X-ing.

45:06.260 --> 45:09.620
The title of my stream was who, who names their kid X death anyway.

45:10.420 --> 45:11.300
That's a good question.

45:12.180 --> 45:17.620
Yeah. Um, and I was doing some word scapes. I'm trying to think of something else that I

45:17.620 --> 45:22.900
want to play, you know, just to kind of, you know, change things up. My schedule changes. Um,

45:23.860 --> 45:27.140
probably the week before, I think it's the week before I go back to work.

45:27.780 --> 45:34.020
No, the week after I go back to work, which is going to be the 20th. Um, so, uh,

45:34.980 --> 45:42.100
that's next month, by the way. So, um, I'm, I'm actually my days off are all going to be together.

45:42.660 --> 45:47.460
So I don't know what that's going to do for what games I'm playing or what I'm streaming, but, um,

45:48.020 --> 45:52.580
but I mean, that's kind of been the vibe right now is just, you know, playing the familiar,

45:52.580 --> 45:56.660
playing the fun, you know, cause that's all I play for is familiar and fun right now.

45:57.860 --> 45:59.860
Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with some comfort food.

46:00.660 --> 46:02.500
I'm just trying to think of those, something,

46:02.500 --> 46:04.420
something a little bit new that I want to do. That's all.

46:05.860 --> 46:07.700
Uh, Loki, we'll go to you. How was your gaming week?

46:08.580 --> 46:14.900
Um, I just played Minecraft. Uh, so I was finishing up, uh, an episode of channel 64.

46:14.900 --> 46:21.940
So I did that this week and then, um, this whole week I'm taking off to work on content.

46:22.740 --> 46:27.620
Of course, it'll probably not end up happening, but I am, that's the plan is to work on content.

46:27.620 --> 46:34.900
So, um, I have three different things going on at the same time as per usual. So I've got, uh,

46:34.900 --> 46:39.940
the monsters mechanics series. I started, uh, like a live stream of, um, want to live stream more of

46:39.940 --> 46:44.340
that, but I have an actual like episode coming up for that, that I'm doing a build. So I was

46:44.340 --> 46:51.380
gathering materials for that. And then I started, um, a vault hunters, uh, or on a vault hunter

46:51.380 --> 46:57.860
server with, uh, some friends from the nerd craft SMP. So, uh, they're playing over there right now.

46:57.860 --> 47:02.740
And I got to check out vault hunters, one 18 a bit, which is fine. If you haven't played it, it's,

47:02.740 --> 47:10.340
um, the quick overview is that basically it's a, uh, different type of gameplay where you

47:11.140 --> 47:15.300
gather materials and you go run these vaults and it's all about collecting loot. And then

47:15.300 --> 47:19.860
with the loot that you get, you can also, um, level up and then you start unlocking like

47:19.860 --> 47:27.700
different mods and whatnot. So it's pretty awesome, but yeah. All right. That's about it.

47:27.700 --> 47:33.780
That's it. Um, my gaming week, um, as I talked about last week, world of Warcraft, uh, Shane's

47:33.780 --> 47:37.860
in chat and we've been playing a lot together. I've been playing on my own. Like I have a character

47:37.860 --> 47:42.740
I'm leveling with him and then I have one I'm leveling on my own. Um, but Final Fantasy 14 did

47:42.740 --> 47:46.660
announce something that has my interest. So I think when you hear me talk again next week,

47:46.660 --> 47:50.260
you're going to hear a little more split time because there's a new boogal tome event. And

47:50.260 --> 47:55.140
if there's anything I love in fall fantasy 14, it's more fucking cosmetics, uh, as a reward. So

47:55.140 --> 48:00.100
I do want to, uh, go back and experience that a little bit. So I don't know. I don't know how long

48:00.100 --> 48:04.820
I can juggle two MMOs, but I had a lot of fun, uh, streaming at the other night. We did a stream on

48:04.820 --> 48:10.820
Friday, question mark night, I think. So, uh, it was fun. Um, other games I played this week,

48:10.820 --> 48:14.900
uh, I think I did some debt by daylight. I believe I was on one of your streams,

48:14.900 --> 48:18.740
Dark Sakura. We played cause I remember you, me and Gwen playing a little bit one night.

48:18.740 --> 48:21.780
We did. And we were also joined by a Loco Poco.

48:21.780 --> 48:24.180
Yeah. Who has to carry us all. Yes. He's so good at the game.

48:25.220 --> 48:25.860
I know. Right.

48:25.860 --> 48:30.420
And what a hero he'll die on hooks so we can get out. So yeah, he was, he was a good sport. So,

48:30.420 --> 48:35.700
uh, yeah, that was, that was fun. I had fun doing that. Um, I definitely need to make sure I joined

48:35.700 --> 48:39.860
at least once a week. So, Oh yeah. Finara brought up her double finger moment or excuse me, her

48:39.860 --> 48:44.820
double middle finger moment. So that was great. And I clipped it, but, uh,

48:44.900 --> 48:48.260
you got, I don't think I was in that match. No, I was. Cause I remember commenting.

48:48.260 --> 48:53.060
It was the three of us. So Loco Poco wasn't there. And we had, wasn't it a pinhead,

48:53.060 --> 48:59.060
sweaty pinhead that was like slugging and all this stuff. I don't know. Like the, it was just,

48:59.060 --> 49:04.180
the pinhead was just a pain in the ass and, uh, the chain hunt was going on. So everybody was

49:04.180 --> 49:09.300
slowed, but thank God when the hatch spawned, it spawned like right near where Finara was

49:09.300 --> 49:12.900
and she was able to get out. And that felt like a really good way to stick it to that pinhead.

49:13.620 --> 49:17.540
Right in the hill there. That was beautiful. Beautiful moment. Beautiful moment. And that

49:17.540 --> 49:22.100
actually also felt extra good because Finara was usually the first one to die on hook. So I'm,

49:22.100 --> 49:26.660
I'm glad she got to be the champion in that match and really stick it to that,

49:26.660 --> 49:33.780
you know, pee hitty. So, all right. Um, let's see what else during my gaming week. Uh, there was

49:33.780 --> 49:39.700
that Dead by Daylight. There was, um, Oh, I've played something new. I played soul survivors.

49:39.700 --> 49:43.300
So I've been into the survivors genre lately because of vampire. And I kept saying,

49:43.300 --> 49:46.180
I'm good. I think I'm going to check out the soul survivors game. I've seen other people

49:46.180 --> 49:51.140
streaming and so forth. I did download it and check it out. And it's, it's fun. I, yeah, it's,

49:51.140 --> 49:55.060
uh, it's pretty addictive. It's one of those things where I'm like, I'll just play one more

49:55.060 --> 49:59.060
round. And it's like 20 minutes later, my round is finally ending because I'm getting better at

49:59.060 --> 50:04.740
the video game and, uh, I'm beating more Titan bosses or whatever they're called. So it's good.

50:04.740 --> 50:09.300
It's a survivors game, but it looks, it's more modern graphics. It uses the more 2.5 D kind

50:09.300 --> 50:14.100
of graphics as opposed to vampire survivors kind of looks like ripped off Castlevania art. Like,

50:14.100 --> 50:17.460
I hate to say it, but it, you know, that's what it looks like. It's part of its charm though.

50:17.460 --> 50:21.700
And I think what drove a lot of people to it, uh, this one has a little more original art,

50:21.700 --> 50:25.620
but it looks really nice. And, um, it's, it's a lot of fun to play. So good. Uh,

50:25.620 --> 50:28.820
Infinoris' poop clicker 20 minutes of what the hell did I just play?

50:30.500 --> 50:37.300
Seriously, it's a cookie clicker three. Um, so yeah, there's that. Uh, and then, uh, yesterday,

50:37.540 --> 50:42.660
some friends and I went out to do Pikmin bloom because it was community day in Pikmin bloom.

50:42.660 --> 50:48.020
Keep in mind though, yesterday it was storming here, especially in the morning. So we were like,

50:48.020 --> 50:51.620
how the fuck are we going to do a Pikmin bloom day? Cause usually we'll walk downtown or a walk

50:51.620 --> 50:56.500
around the college or, you know, somewhere to get 10,000 steps in. And usually there's a community

50:56.500 --> 51:01.300
day for one of the other Niantic games as well, be it Pokemon go or Ingress. And there really wasn't

51:01.300 --> 51:06.340
this time it was just Pikmin was doing its thing. Uh, Ingress was having an event in Japan,

51:06.340 --> 51:11.620
but it didn't affect anything here. So, um, we were trying to find a place to walk.

51:11.620 --> 51:16.260
We tried to go to the mall out in Roseville because we thought, Oh, it'll be empty because

51:16.260 --> 51:22.660
of the storms. People are going to stay home. Ha ha. That place was a disaster. We couldn't

51:22.660 --> 51:28.180
find a parking spot and we left. So we were like, fuck it. So we left, uh, we ended up walking.

51:29.460 --> 51:34.420
Yeah. I guess the, the need for the holiday shopping superseded the storms and people

51:34.420 --> 51:38.020
staying home. We should have, I was like, I thought malls were dying. I thought,

51:38.020 --> 51:42.180
I thought everybody was bitching about people going to online buying now, but boy,

51:42.180 --> 51:47.300
you wouldn't realize it over there. So there's a cute little old town, not far from there.

51:47.300 --> 51:51.780
We just went with a ton of pokey stops and Pikmin stuff. So we walked up and down there because it

51:51.780 --> 51:56.980
happened to be sunny for like a two hour break right around the time we were not sunny, but

51:56.980 --> 52:01.860
clear. Uh, so we, we got our steps in. Thank you very much. And that was a lot of fun. So,

52:02.740 --> 52:08.180
all right. That was pretty much my gaming week. All right. Uh, let's move on and get

52:08.180 --> 52:13.620
into some more gaming news and we'll start off Loki with another big headline from the week.

52:14.660 --> 52:22.420
Yep. Uh, so the federal trade commission has sued to prevent the Microsoft Activision

52:22.420 --> 52:31.460
deal from going through. And, um, of course, I mean, it's a weird thing. Yeah, I get why,

52:31.540 --> 52:38.180
but also at the same time, discovery Warner, um, HBO or whatever else. I mean, it's like,

52:38.180 --> 52:42.260
okay, let's come after Microsoft, but let's not go after these other guys.

52:42.260 --> 52:46.980
I get, I also get why, and this is the way I phrased it, uh, when I was talking about it on

52:46.980 --> 52:56.100
Mastodon is that my desire for the big fish to stop eating the other big fish is superseded by

52:56.100 --> 53:01.220
my desire to see the management at Activision Blizzard changed. Uh, and this is going to get

53:01.220 --> 53:06.740
that done. So it's, this is the whole thing where it's like, I, I don't love the big companies buying

53:06.740 --> 53:10.020
other big companies. And I understand people are sick of seeing that in this industry.

53:10.740 --> 53:15.380
Activision Blizzard in particular is a problem in its current state and it needs to be fixed.

53:15.380 --> 53:22.020
And therefore I'm like government, just let this one go. But I, I, I understand their concerns.

53:22.500 --> 53:26.580
Right. Uh, basically saying, you know, Microsoft has shown that it can,

53:26.580 --> 53:33.140
it can and will withhold content from its rivals. Uh, today we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining

53:33.140 --> 53:37.620
control over leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition, multiple dynamic

53:37.620 --> 53:43.620
and fast growing markets. I completely disagree with that considering that we've already seen

53:43.620 --> 53:49.460
that there's still, um, they were complying with the agreements that were in place already

53:50.340 --> 53:53.700
for Bethesda games on Sony's platform. Um,

53:53.700 --> 53:56.580
Minecraft is one of the top selling games on the switch.

53:56.580 --> 54:01.460
They have their games on all these different platforms. They've committed to putting those

54:01.460 --> 54:08.420
games on other platforms. If anything, Sony does that. I mean, it's just, it's kind of weird to

54:08.420 --> 54:14.900
hear that, but whatever. Um, but in response to that though, they have entered in a 10 year

54:14.900 --> 54:21.220
commitment to bring call of duty to Nintendo following the merger and as well as, um,

54:21.220 --> 54:24.900
putting it on steam, even though I think it already was on steam. Yeah, it is. Yeah.

54:26.340 --> 54:29.380
It will still be on steam for the next 10 years.

54:29.380 --> 54:34.820
Didn't Gavin come out and say, thanks, but we trust you. Like, he was like, you, you didn't

54:34.820 --> 54:39.060
need to like sign an agreement. You've, you've, I thought it was because Gavin kind of came out

54:39.060 --> 54:45.220
and said, gave new, uh, uh, head of valve came out and said, like, you guys, we didn't need a

54:45.220 --> 54:50.100
contract. We didn't need a contract and you should be able to merge. So he's kind of supporting it.

54:50.660 --> 54:56.260
Um, which is interesting because if you think about it, Xbox on the PC and a game pass in

54:56.260 --> 55:00.900
particular is kind of a competitor to steam, but that hasn't stopped Microsoft from releasing their

55:00.900 --> 55:07.300
games on steam. Right. And yeah, Brad Smith, the Microsoft president said also our acquisition will

55:07.300 --> 55:10.740
bring quality to more gamers and platforms or whatever. And that's good for competition. Good

55:10.740 --> 55:16.340
for customers. Um, also wrote a thank you tweet and at Nintendo, Hey, any day Sony wants to sit

55:16.340 --> 55:19.620
down and talk, we'll be happy to hammer a 10 year deal for PlayStation as well.

55:20.180 --> 55:21.060
What were you saying, Jamie?

55:22.660 --> 55:23.140
Nothing.

55:23.140 --> 55:30.260
Okay. Sorry. Um, now a lot of people are also joking about LOL call of duty on the switch.

55:31.300 --> 55:34.980
Um, I think there's some stuff to read in there that it's sort of,

55:34.980 --> 55:40.420
I mean, we all know it's coming, but this doesn't mean that, that if they're going to support call

55:40.420 --> 55:44.980
of duty for 10 years, it's all going to be on the Nintendo switch. I think this just screams that

55:44.980 --> 55:49.860
call of duty will be on a Nintendo successor. I know a lot of people are also talking about cloud

55:49.860 --> 55:55.940
gaming and yes, the switch can handle the cloud and all that stuff. I feel like what we haven't

55:55.940 --> 56:01.540
seen at least on Nintendo's platform yet, uh, in America. And that's a key distinction in America

56:02.180 --> 56:08.580
is multiplayer cloud gaming on the switch. Everything that's been released resident evil

56:09.140 --> 56:12.580
control. I've been like single player stuff. I'm not saying it can't handle it or that it

56:12.580 --> 56:19.060
would function much differently. I'm just curious if the cloud stuff is popular enough in the U S I

56:19.060 --> 56:24.180
would really want to see what the sales of control or those things have looked like, because I just

56:24.180 --> 56:29.060
feel like, yes, cloud gaming is a way they could do it. That doesn't mean that's how they are going

56:29.060 --> 56:35.380
to do it. I'm not convinced, especially until in Japan, this is a different story, but call of duty

56:35.380 --> 56:40.820
isn't a Japan issue either like that. I mean, I'm sure there are some fans over there that import it

56:40.820 --> 56:46.100
just as, you know, we import stuff from there and so forth, but it's just, it's, it's a non issue

56:46.100 --> 56:51.140
for the Japanese audience. I just feel like the cloud thing isn't really proven as a big sell.

56:51.140 --> 56:57.700
Like you're not going to sell call of duty in large numbers on a cloud switch game yet 10 years

56:57.700 --> 57:02.500
down the line, I think cloud gaming is going to be a lot more integrated even by Nintendo. And the

57:02.500 --> 57:08.180
story is different. But I think this just sort of confirms Nintendo has got to be working on beefier

57:08.180 --> 57:12.580
hardware. But at the same time, if they got no man's sky running on the switch, then shit, they

57:12.580 --> 57:13.540
can get call of duty running.

57:13.540 --> 57:17.620
Well, yeah, but like, just because you're able to like really,

57:18.340 --> 57:20.500
just because they can doesn't mean they should.

57:21.140 --> 57:26.420
You can super optimize that game doesn't mean it's a testament that it will run anything like it

57:26.420 --> 57:34.340
really won't. And yet to the actual quotes we had from like, Nintendo. So Nintendo commented

57:34.340 --> 57:38.180
by saying that Nintendo confirms the accuracy of the Microsoft statement, we have nothing further

57:38.180 --> 57:43.620
to announce on the topic. And then gave new all his statement was we're happy that Microsoft wants

57:43.620 --> 57:49.300
to continue using steam to reach the customers with call D when their Activision acquisition closes.

57:49.300 --> 57:54.100
Microsoft has been on steam for a long time, and we take that as a signal that they're happy with

57:54.100 --> 57:59.460
the gamer reception and that we're what we're doing. Our job is to keep building valuable

57:59.460 --> 58:04.260
features that for Microsoft and all steam customer partners. Microsoft offered even says a draft

58:04.260 --> 58:07.940
agreement for the long term call of duty commitment, but it wasn't necessary for us because

58:07.940 --> 58:13.380
a we're not believers in requiring any partner to have an agreement that locks them into shipping

58:13.380 --> 58:21.140
games on steam, or for future was a distant projects or whatever. That's a dig at epic.

58:21.620 --> 58:27.700
Uh, be Phil in the games team at Microsoft have always followed through on what they told us.

58:27.700 --> 58:33.620
And we do trust their intentions. And see, we think that Microsoft has all of the motivation

58:33.620 --> 58:40.180
they need to be on platforms and devices where Call of Duty or wants to be. So yeah, I think

58:40.180 --> 58:45.220
they're right. Yeah, it's got to be on like, as many platforms as possible. Then yeah, sure,

58:45.220 --> 58:50.260
like down the road, you know, they can start trying to get more people on their platform

58:50.260 --> 58:55.940
using that as leverage. But I mean, it I don't think that hasn't really been their strategy

58:55.940 --> 59:01.460
with like a lot of things like them, you know, so I don't see why they would continue doing that.

59:01.460 --> 59:06.980
That's why like, you know, when I look at stuff like this, like, I really wish the government

59:06.980 --> 59:12.100
would come after like other companies a little harder instead, like we have, you know, Microsoft

59:12.100 --> 59:18.340
talking about merging and they're not like saying, Oh, hey, yeah, we made them create Call of Duty

59:18.340 --> 59:21.540
for next year, but then we just scrapped it because we're going to write it off as a tax

59:21.540 --> 59:25.540
write off thing, you know, oh, even though it was done and everything when you guys will just never

59:25.540 --> 59:30.100
play it because it's tax write off. You know, that's the stuff that like Warner Discovery

59:30.100 --> 59:37.860
things going on. Yeah, like can get her Jade, get them. Yeah, they're canning fully made movies

59:37.860 --> 59:43.060
and stuff. So it just doesn't make any sense. Like go after them. That's the type of stuff you should

59:43.060 --> 59:47.940
be going after. But I get it, you know, any acquisitions that further monopolizes the space

59:48.500 --> 59:54.820
you know, industry is not good. But like, I think I'll pick the lesser of the two evils here and I

59:55.540 --> 59:57.700
would have them go after discovery. Yeah.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:03.940
So comments from chat a lot of you have your your your opinions in chat for sure. She helped

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:09.060
10 and chat says if Sony and the FTC block the deal, Sony will buy Activision a year later.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:16.740
You know, of course, they would try. Absolutely. And I think that's that that would be so shitty,

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:20.020
because Sony is a bigger company in some ways than Microsoft, especially with the whole TV

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:25.780
and electronics. And you know, I mean, like, it's like, it's doesn't. It's wild. Let's see

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:30.500
other comments in chat. DJ Rama says can't be a monopoly when you only have four to 14% of the

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:38.020
market. I mean, facts like, again, Nintendo is a huge, huge player in this space. And it seems like

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:42.980
they're totally being ignored by Sony as weird is weird. Well, look at what Sony does with like the

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:48.180
Spider Man property talk about monopolistic and not letting their thing be on other platforms.

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:55.140
Like they hold that stuff hostage constantly. So I kettle black. The only thing is I'm I'm going

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.300
to be interested if it does. So yeah, as you want to match this Congress is stupid and doesn't know

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:07.460
the facts. I mean, t but I actually the one thing about this process that I do like is that hopefully

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:11.460
it leads to I don't think it's gonna lead to televised hearings. But it'll lead to hearings

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:15.700
that are on the public record. Maybe it could it could be on C span, I guess you never know. But

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:21.460
it'll be a hearings that are on the public record. And number one, we're gonna get so much NDA locked

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:26.900
good shit that's gonna come out in the the papers and all that stuff like like we've already been

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:31.140
getting like the PlayStation six thing from last week, right? Like it's all fucking coming out in

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:35.300
these like court documents and stuff. So we're gonna get some good gossip from all this stuff

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:41.460
that goes on the public record. So that that'll be fun in some ways. And two, I'm kind of looking

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:48.100
forward to the way the Microsoft lawyers are going to drag Sony right back. And I think there's a lot

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:52.740
of this that kind of maybe needs to come out on the public record. And again, I'm not I'm not

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:57.940
trying to be anti Sony or anything. I'm really not I love all the gaming companies equally. But

01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:04.020
as I said in the beginning, this particular merger, Activision Blizzard needs to change.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:10.100
And this is how it's going to change. And it's no different if Sony just buys them next year,

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:17.540
you know, it just delays this whole thing. So anyway, and also as Joe and her Matt with a good

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:22.820
point, the difference is that gaming doesn't have lobbyists funded by multi hundred million dollar

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:28.420
or millionaire funds like tobacco and so forth. And also points out FTC hearings aren't normally

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:32.500
public or TV congressional meetings are but I think Congress is going to be backed up with

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:39.140
other nonsense hearings starting next year. That house might be but not the Senate. Unless the

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:44.100
Senate takes up the January 6, he has lobbyists for sure they do. Oh, for sure they do. They do.

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:50.980
In fact, there's a whole lobbying. The ESA is the lobbying group. Look at all the good they've done.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:03:00.660
Yeah, yeah, that that and and to be fair to SSU 100. Matt, I too would sometimes forget that

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:08.660
there are lobbyists in the gaming industry. Dejirama S points out, you know, another like,

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:13.060
why aren't they looking at this type of issue? That Saudi Arabian media conglomerate, the one

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:19.540
that owns SNK Playmore? Why is that not being looked at? There's a like, you know, that's the

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:24.980
thing. If this is going to go to public hearings and stuff, then fine, let it but let's get all

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:32.180
the dirt out. Let's let's get it all out there. Let's get ugly. I want it to be the real housewives

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:39.460
of Silicon Valley. That's what I want those hearings to be. Prostitution whore. That's what

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:46.820
that's what I want Microsoft to do at those hearings. All right. Anyway, once the other

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:51.220
thing that Microsoft may have to answer to at those hearings, the fact that they're going to

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:55.380
be upping the cost of their first party games, but you know what, they weren't the first to do

01:03:55.380 --> 01:04:00.500
it. So at this factor, I think they're pretty much the last of the big companies to do this.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:06.740
But the inevitable has come much to Loki's delight, I'm sure that Microsoft's first party

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:12.820
games will be going up to $70. Starfield, Forza Motorsport, Red Fall will have the new pricing

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:18.020
there. This price increase, Microsoft said in a statement will reflect the content scale and

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:24.740
technical complexity of these titles. Also, Microsoft reiterating, you can still get these

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:30.980
through game pass $9.99 per month to start, you can guarantee the price of game pass is going to

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:37.940
go up to guarantee. So if you want to stockpile game pass, like before the new year, like again,

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:42.180
you're I don't want to tell you how to spend your money. And I can't predict the future. And I make

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:47.380
no guarantees. But let me put it this way, I personally will probably buy another year of game

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:52.900
pass and add it to my account. So I'm locked in for at least another year. Technically, you could

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:57.700
do it up to three, but that gets a little pricey for me. But at least for a year, I want to lock in

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:03.140
and be good there. I'll say what I said the last time we talked about the prices going up is that

01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:09.700
I expect a $70 game, then it's $70 game is one that functions correctly and isn't followed by

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:15.300
a roadmap telling me how you're going to finish the game. That's, that's the way it works. Also,

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.420
I'm not going to create your games. So that's the other thing.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:23.300
And what is the delay the game and bring out a finished item?

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:27.380
Sorry. Well, even when they delay the game, it's still bad. Like they did that with Saints row and

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:32.500
they delayed it and then it still was bad. Like it doesn't matter. Starfield has been delayed. So I

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:38.980
mean, I hope that means it is going to be a solid title. Again. I want to believe Phil Spencer,

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:43.380
I want to believe put it on my x files poster. I want to believe Phil Spencer gets it. I do.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:48.660
Like, I feel like again, across all the gaming executives, I feel like he's the one that gets

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:55.060
the current like gamer mentality more than anybody. But the games have to speak for themselves,

01:05:55.060 --> 01:06:05.220
right. And he's not infallible either. So anyway. But as pointed out, Sony has already been doing

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:09.540
this. Ubisoft's been doing this take two has been doing this. God of War Ragnarok, Assassin's Creed,

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:16.100
Mirage, NBA 2k, they're all 70 bucks. Also should point out this also isn't it's not just going to

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:26.420
be for game for Xbox series. This is PC as well is now at the $70 price. You know, I'm just I'm

01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:31.220
gonna I'm kind of feel I kind of echo the thing. I'm like, I understand a $10 price increase,

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:36.580
especially in the day of you know, with inflation, blah, blah, blah. When cartridges used to be more

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:42.580
if you know you want to say that and so forth. But again, yes, give me a game worth $70. If you

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:47.860
put out half baked games, you're just going to encourage your audience to wait for a sale less

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:52.900
and less people are going to be willing to buy day one, which is what you want industry because now

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:57.940
look at all the games. They're not all coming out just for the holiday anymore. I feel like especially

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:02.260
looking at the game awards. It's either the very beginning or the very end of the fiscal year is

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.540
when they're trying to get all the games out now actually more at the end of the fiscal year June

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:10.980
Hello, they're trying to get all the games out by the end of the fiscal year. So that but if you

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:16.100
release at the end of the fiscal year, then you're trying to make a big day one or week one splash.

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:23.620
Like Final Fantasy 16 is releasing June 22. Right? That leaves it like a week and a half

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.820
in the fiscal year to move a lot of copies.

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:32.340
No, here's just another thing to throw out there.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:40.500
What's to say that some of the price hike is to get the soup, the super excited people and then

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:45.460
they put it on sale to lower it technically back down to a regular, regular price.

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:48.980
Oh, we're already selling Gotham Knights that happened with like it was like Gotham Knights

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:52.820
was out what like three weeks and then it was on a Black Friday or one of those sales.

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:58.020
Yeah, so but this way though they can keep manipulating the market too.

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.300
So it's just all a bunch of bullshit.

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:05.860
Miltonius Games in chat says more people will wait for sales and the sales will come because

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:11.860
so much of the money is made with microtransactions. They need people playing the games.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:17.140
Quest Buster says one nice thing about getting a PlayStation five late finding cheap copies for

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:21.380
games like Returnal. That's true because when Returnal comes out on PC, which I am excited

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:24.340
about, it's probably going to run $70 which I'm less excited about.

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:30.660
Gigi Romas says I'm bothered by the $70 price tag only because I've gotten so used to cheaper

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:36.180
prices during the PS 123 Xbox 360 era. Secondly, I still think it's bunked that the prices are

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:40.020
going to be that high. Yes, I do understand that the tech and research costs have gone up,

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.940
but the production media is still cheap. But I've noticed lately most places aren't selling

01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:49.060
CD and DVD spindles anymore. So yeah. Um, you know what, though?

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:57.060
There are a lot of games that are still going to be 2030 bucks. Hades 2, I bet is a $30 game tops

01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:02.980
$29.99. It wasn't even that expensive. Yeah, I think the first one was only 20. So yeah,

01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:08.740
I at maximum, that's going to be a $30 game and maybe another $20 game. Vampire Survivors

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:13.940
making waves $5 game. So thank God for the indie scene and smaller developers

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:21.380
to still be providing a perfectly acceptable quality of game market out there as an

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:27.940
alternative. So it's it's just it's going to be very interesting to see how many people buy into

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:33.380
the $70 price tag. But then again, I'm part of the problem, I guess because I'm looking at certain

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:39.140
games and I'm like, yep, I'll pay it. I want to play that game. I know I'm going to have a good

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:42.660
5060 hours with this game, maybe more. So I'll drop it.

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:51.460
Some folks in chat are talking about cartridges in that whole era. Sjo 100 Matt says it still

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:56.980
amazes me the games were 60 to $70 back in the 90s. Granted, consoles did cost less. Yeah,

01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:00.500
that's because all the tech was in those cartridges. Remember how much the Neo Geo

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:05.700
cartridges cost? But that's because you were- How much they cost right up until the end of the

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:10.740
thing. Because you're literally getting an arcade board in those cartridges. I mean, it's the tech

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:15.780
is in the cartridge, the console is in the cartridge practically. So I mean, it really it

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:23.540
really is like the cheapest one I ever bought brand new was King of Fighters 2000. And it was

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:26.420
the only one I'd ever seen that came out for under 300 bucks.

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:33.220
digital mess as I remember seeing Phantasy Star IV and Virtua Racing going for almost $100. Yeah,

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:37.780
I think because those games in particular had a ton of RAM on them, right? Like didn't they have

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:42.660
like 64 megs of RAM, which for the time was huge. I might be mixing this up a little bit. But like

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:46.980
they just they had a ton of memory on those cartridges. So those games because Phantasy Star

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:52.500
IV, huge game, Virtua Racing, huge game to run those graphics and such, you know, that's why

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:56.340
those cartridges got really expensive was because you had to put more and more memory on them.

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:01.220
Shane in chat says I think Supergiant can get away with the cheaper prices,

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:06.500
because you know, they make a crap ton off merchandise. Good point. Their stuff constantly

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:11.380
sells out and they couldn't even run their own store at a certain point and had to hand it off

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:15.780
to another company. Well, when you you know, when you talk about merchandising, merchandising,

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:21.620
when you talk about that, I think of Minecraft. And you know what, Microsoft only charges 20 bucks

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:25.860
for Minecraft. But write in line with your comment. There's a whole fucking Minecraft

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:33.060
aisle at Target these days. You know, like Minecraft is is huge. Fortnite free. Also

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:40.500
merchandising and obviously a shit ton of microtransactions and so forth. Yeah, I'm trying to

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:44.900
think what else is like Stardew Valley, Stardew Valley have merchandise now at Target. I'm trying

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:49.780
to think what other video games I see with merchandise at Target. Oh, Five Nights at Freddy's.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:51.460
Another example.

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:59.060
One. And we'll see. I don't have seen Piggy. I don't know what that is. But I think it's a game.

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:00.820
Oh, yeah, it's a Roblox game.

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:06.340
Oh, that's why. So yeah, no, yeah, merchandising. You make a lot of money off that too.

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:06.900
For sure.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.500
Wait until our Neopets back.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:16.660
All right. Moving on Dark Sakura. Also some other some other good change in the industry, right?

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:25.140
Yeah, so this one is a very positive thing. So a Microsoft owned company called ZeniMax Studios.

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:36.180
They actually have just recently the the devs have anyway, have unionized 300 of them,

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:41.940
about 300. It's the QA staff at ZeniMax, including developers across Bethesda.

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:46.900
Um, and studios that have worked on like Elder Scrolls Online,

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:58.180
unionized with the communications workers of America. And instead, like the the union drives

01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:05.140
that have been going on with some other companies. Basically, we're like, we're we're sticking to it,

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:10.340
we're going to keep at it. They the quote is saying we applaud Microsoft for remaining neutral

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:14.500
through this process and letting workers decide for themselves, whether they want a union.

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:20.500
The company is fulfilling the commitments they laid out in their labor principles earlier this

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:24.420
year, while sending a resounding message to the video game industry, the right to freely and

01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:28.660
fairly make a choice about union representation should be in the hands of the workers, not the

01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:33.460
management. So basically, we're all these other big companies, you know, like I said, Microsoft,

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:41.060
Blizzard, not Microsoft, like Blizzard and a few other companies have wanted to arbitrate,

01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:47.460
you know, step in, control how the narrative goes, Microsoft is like, this is you, this is all you.

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:58.180
They also organized the QA at Raven Software and Blizzard Albany.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:06.260
But the the managers at ZeniMax have been given very clear guidance to remain neutral.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:13.220
Over about the next four weeks, the QA staff will either sign their union cards or vote through an

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:18.660
electronic portal. And with majority support, the union will then be recognized by Microsoft

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:27.060
and become the largest in the gaming industry. So good for them. Good on them. And good on

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:33.300
Microsoft for that, too. Yeah, I'm appreciative that Microsoft sort of sees the writing on the

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:37.620
wall. I think where this and the industry again, another reason why I'm like, I think Phil Spencer

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:43.460
gets it more than a lot of folks in the industry and is is letting this go through basically and

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:50.580
just letting it happen because it will whether they want it to or not. I like the the statement

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:56.980
from the spokesperson at Microsoft. I'll just read it verbatim. The recent organizing efforts

01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:02.980
of ZeniMax employees and Microsoft is ZeniMax and ZeniMax's neutrality toward this is an example of

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:07.460
our labor principles in action. We remain committed to providing employees with an

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:11.860
opportunity to freely and fairly make choices about their workplace representation.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:17.140
Oh, go ahead. Yeah, I'm just saying that that's pretty, pretty big.

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:22.260
SSJ100Matt in chat with a great comment. The industry is slowly getting unionized. It's a

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:26.020
great thing. Don't listen to the industry when they try to blame the unions for the higher game

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:31.220
prices. Good point because they will. Making sure workers are treated and paid fairly benefits the

01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:35.780
people working on them and lastly, the games themselves. Great point by SSJ100Matt and quite

01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:41.540
honestly, a call out to the gaming press and the press in general. When you're going to print these

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:46.100
CEO statements that are trying to blame the unions for the higher cost, you need to print what the

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:52.900
CEO made last year right in the same sentence. If you're going to print that sentence that the CEO

01:15:52.900 --> 01:16:00.020
blamed the salary, then the next sentence should be Bobby Kotick made X million dollars in stock

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:04.420
X million dollars in last year. Those two need to go together.

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:08.020
The other thing too is you also need to look at the corporate interests of the people

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:14.340
of the companies that are reporting this information and what they're looking like for

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:19.300
their union policies. Just saying. It's a big picture.

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:24.740
Well, sadly, just in time before the holidays with Hanukkah next week and Christmas in two weeks,

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.740
our industry's not being nice to some people.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:40.820
It's like a yearly tradition. Hey, it's Christmas time. You're fired. So, IGN has laid off some

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:47.460
of their staff as well, just before the game awards, no doubt as well. This affected some of

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:56.980
their content engineering and ad sales, part of a large restructuring across Ziff Davis.

01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:05.140
So, don't know exactly how many are impacted yet, but quite a few people have lost their

01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:13.540
jobs from there. Then of course, to go along with that, to get all your holiday shopping done

01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:21.140
at GameStop, well, they're also facing layoffs as well. Ironically though, it is coming in the form

01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:28.900
of engineering staff as well. Well, right now, they also don't know what the impact of, or how

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:35.940
many staff were impacted, but it is at least six software engineering staff that have confirmed

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:43.300
that they've lost their jobs there, but it's mostly impacted the blockchain wallet development

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:49.700
I was going to say, I wonder if it's because that NFT market landed like a turd, like it just like

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:57.620
no one, NFT, no one fucking T cares. I don't, no one fucking touched it. Thank you. Yeah.

01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:05.060
The NFT marketplace, like that's, that's, that's unfortunate, but, uh, you know,

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:09.780
cause obviously the people making that were just trying to do a good job, you know, and I don't

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:15.460
fault them, but you know, it just, it was a bad vision by the executive in the first place who

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:21.220
I'm going to guess was not laid off as a part of this, but probably should be. But unfortunately

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:27.460
that is how this industry works far too often. So yeah, anyway, no one fucking touched it. So I'm,

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:33.700
I'm yeah, I, I, yeah, not the retail workers at this point. I mean, I'm sure that they've

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:39.380
also done different things to reduce head count for whatnot, and they were still restructuring

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:44.980
what they said. Oh yeah. Now that we're emerging from our rebuilding phase of our transformation

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:50.020
GameStop has a strong foundation, blah, blah, blah, which to pursue profitability in the

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:56.180
near term, substantial growth and blah, blah, blah. Um, it's not wealth that trickles down.

01:18:56.180 --> 01:19:03.380
It's bullshit. Yeah. Well, it's, it's a sinking ship that they're trying to,

01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:09.460
you know, shovel water out of. And the NFT was like trying to,

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:16.500
it was dumb, like trying to use a dime to stop, you know, a bucket size hole. So anyway,

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:20.660
like anyone could have told them that was, I mean, people did tell them that was a dumb idea,

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:26.980
but, um, they see dollar signs and it's different. Um, you know, going back to the

01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:30.660
IGN thing a little bit though, I feel like, you know, media obviously in general has been

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:35.540
taken a hit, you know, obviously G4 and all that a couple months ago. Um, you know,

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:39.140
I was kind of thinking about like, why does media seem to really be taking a beating? And, you know,

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:43.460
when it was G4, I think we were just talking about, I think there was a lot of ways that,

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:47.220
again, management, it was mismanaged and I think mis-marketed. And I think they,

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:52.020
they spread themselves too thin with seven different preferences online. However, that

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:57.380
being said, I think there was just also a lot of, they had to compete with, you know, streamers,

01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:04.180
YouTubers, and just other homemade content. And I think in the case of IGN, it's social media

01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:11.940
and like, just honestly like accounts like Wario 64 on Twitter. Now I personally don't use Twitter

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:17.060
anymore, but I recognize the fact that accounts like, you know, Wario 64 and some of the other,

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:21.460
you know, gaming, what, Nebelion at a time. And there's just, you know, and other like,

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:24.340
God, it doesn't even have to be somebody that exclusively tweets about it. Just

01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:31.940
when you have a curated list in general, wherever you're at, Mastodon, Instagram, TikTok,

01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:35.300
you know, wherever social media you're at. I think a lot of people are kind of getting

01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:41.060
their news as a part of that now. And if IGN doesn't have a smart strategy, like

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:47.860
IGN, if IGN's social media presence read like a Wario 64 feed, they probably would be in a

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:56.340
lot better shape. But it is what it is. Anyway. People.

01:20:56.340 --> 01:21:07.540
Yep. All right. Moving on. Let's tell this is wild. So it came up on last week's show,

01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:13.540
or maybe two weeks ago, that Yuji Naka had been arrested. He was detained about insider stock

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:20.180
trading, basically, that he knew that there was a Dragon Quest spin off or something coming out.

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:24.740
And he had bought some, some shares around that, you know, you're not supposed to do that. That's

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:30.420
what Martha Stewart went to jail for. Although, many people could argue that, you know, she went

01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:35.700
to jail to be a symbol and all this other stuff. But I digress. Insider trading was hypothetically

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:40.340
what she went to jail for. So Yuji Naka is now being accused of the same thing in Japan. So that

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:46.820
happened a couple weeks ago. And now it's being reported, he got arrested again, about the battle

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:50.900
royale game Final Fantasy seven, the first soldier, which didn't they pull the plug on

01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:58.260
that actually. But yeah, they did. But again, he bought shares right before the 2021 announcement

01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:02.740
of the game. Of course, you probably know the name Yuji Naka from Sonic the Hedgehog being

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:08.020
the creator of that. But then of course, he worked with Square Enix on Ballon Wonderland.

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:13.540
So one would imagine he probably did have some inside thoughts as to what was going on there.

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:18.180
Of course, that will all have to be proven in a court. And I admittedly do not know how that

01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:23.380
works in a Japanese court versus the US court. So I will just have to rely on the news to keep

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:30.340
me updated on what's going on with that. But yep, in this latest report, apparently he bought shares

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:34.820
in a team entertainment just before it was announced that they were going to create Final

01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:40.740
Fantasy seven, the first soldier, he paid 144 7 million yen, that's over a million US dollars,

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:46.500
just over a million US dollars for 120,000 shares. He was arrested alongside Tai Suke,

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:52.500
Sasaki, a Square Enix employee, who also was arrested over that same aiming issue in the last

01:22:52.500 --> 01:23:04.260
month. Interesting. So also to be noted, they released it mobile for, excuse me, they released

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:09.780
the game on mobile in November last year, and then less than a year later, it was shut down.

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:14.580
No word if he sold his shares before that happened. But I doubt it.

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:20.100
People don't pay attention. They think that they're going to be above it, that no one's

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.500
going to catch it when all this stuff is on the public record.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:28.100
Yeah, it's just and it's it's hard for some people, I think to think with Yuji Naka,

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:31.940
you know, and again, this whole thing is alleged. So we can't say for sure. But

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:36.580
boy, fool me once shame on you and fool me twice. Right. But this whole thing is not get,

01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:40.180
you know, it's like, Oh, he's the guy that we saw under the hedgehog. I love that game as a kid.

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:46.020
Well, some of our childhood heroes, it turns out are shitty people. It's unfortunate.

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:50.980
All right. I'm just like, what's the saying? Never meet your heroes.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:57.380
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. Anyway, let's let's try to focus on some heroes that are

01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:01.700
hopefully less shitty in this next segment we like to do here at Orange Launch Radio every week.

01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:18.020
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:22.980
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:28.980
And while I get the video up here, Dark Sakura, what did you pick for tonight's

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:37.060
classic game of the week? It shows Street Fighter x Mega Man or cross Mega Man,

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.860
however you prefer to say it. Um, yeah, we're we're doing another fan game.

01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:52.980
No, I love it. And a crossover. So the game came out on December 17 2012. I know I'm a little bit

01:24:53.780 --> 01:25:01.860
within that 10 year period. But I think it's fine because we're we might be missing a week anyway.

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:13.540
So at any rate, the game was developed by a fan developer in Singapore named Sial Zong Hui,

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:19.140
I think I pronounced that right. And he did it as a labor of love, just a little, you know,

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:27.860
private development. And he sent an early build of it to Christian Zvenson, who is Capcom's senior

01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:34.820
VP of consumer software at Evo 2012. And then he showed that and then he showed that build to

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:40.180
several staff members in the Capcom office. And Capcom's like, Hey, we're gonna help you out.

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:48.820
And he's like, cool. So he continued to develop the game based on his original design,

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:54.260
but Capcom took over the things like the funding, the marketing QA and decided to

01:25:55.540 --> 01:26:06.260
distribute the game on on PC so that the creator wouldn't have to deal with license for console

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:15.140
development. And Svenson said that Capcom could consider console releases in the future,

01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:21.460
but just chose to release it on PC so it could go out at its target date.

01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:31.380
There were some concepts that were scrapped in its creation. But let me rewind a little bit and

01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:39.940
tell you what the game is. So the game, it plays like a Mega Man game. It has Mega Man or Rockman

01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:46.740
right in the front. And you go through their levels the same way that, you know,

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:53.940
Mega Man always does. But your bosses are Street Fighter characters. You have characters like Ryu,

01:26:54.820 --> 01:27:08.420
you have Blanca, Chun-Li. I remember Rolento, Rose. What's the dude with the- I can't remember

01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:12.820
his name now. No, not Dalsim. I know Dalsim is in there, but the dude from Street Fighter 3.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:24.580
Oh well, I can't remember. Anyway, Crimson Viper is in there. But if you clear certain conditions,

01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:32.340
you also can fight hidden bosses in the form of Sagat and Akuma slash Golgi at the end of the game.

01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:34.340
It's not Urien, is it?

01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:38.020
I don't remember.

01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:46.420
Yeah, it's Urien. That's it. Yep. Okay. Anyway, back to the development on this.

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:54.180
Basically, there are other concepts that he had to scrap that Zangri did.

01:27:55.460 --> 01:28:00.500
Yang was supposed to be in there, but was replaced by Chun-Li. Although his special

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:07.460
weapon is still included via cheat codes and he wanted to put alternate costumes for characters

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:12.820
and a second playable character where it's one of the Street Fighter people, but that got scrapped.

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:18.660
There were several complaints about the game crashing after it was released and also about the

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:25.860
user interface and the lack of a save system. So in response, Vincent said that there was a patch

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:33.620
being discussed and then it was released on January 28, 2013 as Street Fighter X Mega Man

01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:40.340
V2 and it had a better user interface, better controller compatibility, bug fixes,

01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:48.420
and a password system that looks a lot like the Mega Man Mega Man 2 ones and an additional boss

01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:56.340
character. The music was all done in chiptune by Luke Esquivel, also a underscore rival.

01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:06.420
Esquivel became evolved when he actually reached out to the developer to request being a full-time

01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:19.540
musician for the game. He compared his own stuff with the previous musician and so he was brought

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:26.740
on. He combined Mega Man themes and Street Fighter themes for certain songs and he used elements like,

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:39.460
for example, Ryu's theme mixes with Crash Man's music. So it's pretty cool the way the two marry.

01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:46.820
And then there's some completely original ones like the Wily map theme and the beginning of the

01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:56.260
end theme and the soundtrack was considered so popular that the soundtrack got released. I love

01:29:56.260 --> 01:30:08.340
it. There was an EP with four tracks that is called Street Fighter X Mega Man extended volume

01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:19.860
one on February 8, 2013. It had four extra ones. It also had a remix of Ryu's theme,

01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:25.940
Young's theme that was unused, Voice Collection and Sagat's theme. One of the things I have to point

01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:37.860
out is how clever they mimic speech. If you go and listen to Ryu, even though it's not actually

01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:47.780
synthesized speech, it sounds like he's calling out his attacks. I would say more based on the

01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:55.620
Street Fighter II version of them just by mimicking intonation and tone from when he says

01:30:55.620 --> 01:31:06.420
it. I think it's quite clever. But the game actually really did exceed expectations. They

01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:15.540
haven't released any official real numbers for that first week but again they're like,

01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:22.900
damn, this was enough that it caused strain on their servers. This was noted by Capcom

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:30.820
Senior Community Manager Brett Elston. And by March 3, 2013, the game had been downloaded

01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:43.860
one million times. It got mostly positive reviews. The initial game had some very mixed reviews but

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:53.620
clearly they listened to people. They put out that better one. There were some people who were

01:31:53.620 --> 01:32:00.420
just way too critical. At Edge, they gave it a 5 out of 10 noting inconsistent level design and

01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:05.700
limited functionality is its biggest flaw. But I don't know. It plays like a Mega Man game.

01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:13.940
I mean, it's not perfect but it's a really enjoyable game. The soundtrack is really part

01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:25.460
of what makes it shine so I'm really glad that the developer went with A-Rival. It's just a great

01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:33.060
game. It's absolutely worth bringing up. I have parts of the soundtrack on my permanent rotation

01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:40.820
on my video game music soundtrack. There it is. Classic game of the week. Street Fighter

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:50.820
across Mega Man. For a side project, again, very impressive because this really wasn't an official

01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:56.420
Mega Man game but it's kind of embraced. But it was enough that Capcom didn't notice.

01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:03.620
It's dang impressive. I like that pick because I like this game and I like these types of

01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:11.940
fun little side projects. It's the little fan game that could. It became a real game.

01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:17.540
It did. It sure did. It didn't even need a Blue Fairy. It just needed Capcom.

01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:25.940
But I agree. The soundtrack is a real highlight of the whole game. I can see some of the minus points

01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:29.620
on the level design and so forth. You could even see it in those two stages.

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:37.220
At the end of the day, as far as what it is, what it brings to the table,

01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:41.060
just the fact that they designed it all that way, it still deserves massive kudos. The game

01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:48.500
had probably zero budget so it's amazing. I think it was cool that Capcom handled the

01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:53.860
rest of the side of it. They did actually give some funds for development.

01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:56.820
I'm glad they didn't pull a Nintendo and C&D it.

01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:03.060
This is the thing that Nintendo needs to pay attention to. Look how lucrative

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:12.820
something like this could be. What if they had put it out for Steam for, say, two bucks?

01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:24.180
Right? Imagine two bucks a million times. Just saying. It may be chump change, but it's change.

01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:27.300
Matters to somebody.

01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:33.620
All right. Well, thank you for that pick. Let's move on and cover some other video

01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:38.420
game news around the industry in rapid fire news. We will start with Loki.

01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:48.980
So the latest episode of The Simpsons brought in a nice cameo from Roblox or in this one,

01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:57.140
it's Bo blocks, obviously. The whole premise of the story there is that apparently Bart was

01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:04.500
playing like an Assassin's Creed VR type game. And because it's too violent, March made him play

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:09.780
a more kid friendly game. And that's where they got into Bo blocks. And then he finds out that

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:15.300
he can do some of the cosmetic items and sell them for real world cash because their computer is so

01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:22.580
old. So it ends up this whole racketeering thing with Skinner and everything, trying to earn money

01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:27.460
to, you know, fix up the school and stuff. And then there's like gang rivalries, other school

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:32.740
gang rivalries and stuff like that. So it sounds hilarious. It looks funny. I'll have to check it

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:43.540
out. But yeah, funny to see blocks and a Simpsons episode. And then I've still amazed that The

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:50.660
Simpsons is still on TV making fun of current pop culture. It's pretty wild. It is. And then

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:57.220
Halo Infinite is getting a cool update this month with a custom game browser. So all those things

01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:03.940
in Forge now, you can check out and play them, which is pretty cool. And there's been some really

01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:11.300
neat creations, everything from Andy's bedroom to I think I saw Princesses Peach or Princess

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:16.100
Peaches castle and they have like different game ideas like paintball and stuff like that. So

01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:23.700
yeah, pretty cool. Worth checking out if you have a Halo Infinite or game pass to grab it or that.

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:25.940
Yes. All right, Dar Sakura.

01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:31.940
You got the mute on Discord.

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:41.380
There we go. So for anyone who is a fan of the classic series ToeJam and Earl,

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:49.220
there is a movie in the works at Amazon Studios. Especially since there was the crowdfunded

01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:55.220
game released just not too terribly long ago. But it's being produced by Unanimous Media,

01:36:55.220 --> 01:37:01.620
the studio that was found by Stephen Curry, screenplay by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo,

01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:09.380
both who worked on Hotel Transylvania and on Disney's upcoming Superfudge series.

01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:13.380
I want to say I should have known about that. I love those books.

01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:22.660
But also it's co-produced by Story Kitchen. So there's people with big names involved in this

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:30.020
one. But it doesn't say really a whole lot about it. So hopefully it'll go by the original game,

01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:35.620
you know, just that they get marooned on earth and they have to put their ship back together

01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:42.020
and leave. But I hope they keep the satirical nature of the game. So this would be

01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:47.300
hopefully this will be good. You caught the attention of several people in chat with the

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:52.900
whole Superfudge reference, Tales of Fourth Grade Nothing, that whole thing. But apparently,

01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:57.780
I did not know they were doing that again. Didn't they do a series in the movie or something?

01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:01.620
And then a long time ago. It's been a while ago. Yeah, I can't remember either.

01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:06.020
But I kind of would like something focused on Margaret.

01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:10.260
Oh, a timely update for that.

01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:15.940
I have I've read Are You There, God It's Me, Margaret, like when I was really little.

01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:21.300
And because I mean, these books were written in the late 70s, I think.

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.180
Yeah, late 70s.

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:30.260
I would love to have an updated story for Margaret if they're going to try to update,

01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:36.980
you know, Farley Drexel Thatcher, good old Julie, how I remember his name, for real.

01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.820
And the baby's name Tootsie.

01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.700
The one this is not the same author. But when I think of childhood books that were huge,

01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:47.540
like around that age, when I were reading those books, like fourth grade stuff.

01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:52.980
Thank you. Did you remember it says there was a Superfudge TV series in the 90s ABC Saturday

01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:58.500
mornings? Really? I didn't know that anyway. Um, but I think of the Ramona books.

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:05.700
And they yeah, PBS did do see because that author died relatively recently,

01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:08.740
like a couple years ago, and she was like 99 or so she was, you know, up there.

01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:12.180
Encyclopedia Brown. Oh, my God.

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:19.380
Okay, I know that they made a movie for it, and I have yet to see it. But one of my favorite books

01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:26.180
as a kid was from the mixed up files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.

01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:28.020
Oh, yeah, they they did a TV. Yeah.

01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:32.340
Yeah, I loved that book. I've read that book so many times. Like,

01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:34.660
I used to have dreams of just moving into a museum.

01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:42.260
Um, the other the other one would be the roll doll. But even though I, I believe wasn't wasn't

01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:47.540
he kind of issue it but but I remember still reading like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:51.700
and I read the glass elevator, which elevator was an interesting story.

01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:56.340
Did they ever make that they weren't going to and he his he denied it.

01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:02.660
Because he was he was displeased with how the movie turned out.

01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:07.780
Yeah. Phil of nine and chat says doll was canceled. All right. But But you know what,

01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:13.380
I was like 10 when I read those books. So but James the giant peach was a huge one. I remember

01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:18.900
Disney did a thing on that. So yeah, so. Wow. Dr. Seuss's Beverly clearly was 104

01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:22.900
when she passed get out. I thought she was like late 90s. I mean, I know she had a nice long run,

01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:27.940
but that's incredible. All right. Anyway, sorry. rapid fire news is turning into book chat

01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:33.780
with the orange lounge bookie. Oh, anyway. And but here's the thing. Judy Blume is still

01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:39.860
alive and still writing. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yep. As she says they did a remake of the witches

01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:44.980
a few years ago. Yeah, apparently it did not. It kind of landed thud. I guess people didn't

01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:48.980
want to see that one remade because it was very creepy. Didn't and it creepier. Yeah,

01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:52.580
didn't Anne Hathaway put well, it was also true to the book, the grand high witch,

01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:57.300
if I'm not mistaken, which was she played the grand high witch. Because you know, they

01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:01.060
wait, of course, you know, but just for the audience, they completely changed the 80s,

01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:06.820
which is the ending is completely different. But I believe the new one had the original

01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:14.500
that the first movie had a happy ending. Yeah. Anyway, we thought that him staying as a mouse

01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:20.580
was a happy ending. Oh, let's let's talk about some games that were out around that age. We

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:27.780
were reading all those books. And thanks to arcade archives. We got another game on the switch that

01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:32.740
I'm sure is on its way to PlayStation as well. It's Pac mania was the game for this week. It

01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:40.500
released on December 8 2022. This of course was Pac Man going 3d although it was more like 2.5 d

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:46.020
but that's what 3d was back in that era. And of course that infamous jump button that made the

01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:52.340
game a lot easier. So you probably always got a little further in Pac mania than you did the other

01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:58.580
games but yep, that is on the switch e shop and I'm pretty sure it's got to be on the PlayStation

01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:05.300
four as well as those hamster arcade archive releases tend to be. Alright, let's travel

01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:10.020
around the world and check out some games that will be out this week. Although I imagine it's

01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:16.340
got to be slowing down. No, no, says Logie. No, there's not much. Oh, not much. Okay.

01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:22.420
No, this week, though, we do have some big stuff. So we have crisis core Final Fantasy seven reunion

01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:27.380
on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:34.980
High on life on PC, Xbox one and Xbox series. The Witcher three wild hunt on PlayStation five

01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:47.060
and Xbox series. Looks like aka or aka on PC and it's in the switch. We have Akai katana shin on

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:53.700
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one Azure Striker gun volt three on PlayStation four

01:42:53.700 --> 01:43:03.060
and PlayStation five black tail on PC, PlayStation five and Xbox series. River City girls two on PC,

01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:09.460
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. And last but

01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:16.420
not least, Megaton Musashi X on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:20.980
Well, going to Japan and looking at the releases there. Yeah,

01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:25.540
this crisis core Final Fantasy seven reunion appears to be worldwide. So it's on Japan's list

01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:30.900
too. And that I did not realize that was still on deck for this year. That's a pretty big deal. So

01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:36.420
that is coming out in the 13th. On the normal release day in Japan, the 15th we have some

01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:42.180
other games for Nintendo Switch, including Akai katana sheen comes out them's fighting herds gets

01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:48.500
its Japanese release on December the 15th. The cosmic fantasy collection is also out in Japan

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:58.580
on that day. And we also have WRC generations. Tetsudo Nippon real pro Tokyo Soko comes out as

01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:02.900
well. And because we have to have a SpongeBob SquarePants game even in Japan the battle for

01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:09.860
Bikini Bottom rehydrated not remastered rehydrated is out in Japan on the switch this week as well.

01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:18.100
Also, if we go over to the PlayStation five, just that same crisis core rerelease

01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:23.460
is out on the PlayStation five as well. Otherwise, nothing specific on the 15th.

01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:32.020
How about Europe dark soccer? I have a literal handful on the 13th for PlayStation Xbox and

01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:38.180
switch we have crisis core Final Fantasy seven reunion. And then Hello Neighbor on Xbox Hello

01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:44.660
Neighbor two. That that that's all that's on the list. All right. All right. We have a few more

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.260
stories for you. And then we're going to be inviting you all to participate with our show

01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:52.580
if you want to ask some comments in our chat, although you might want to hold off on any

01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:56.420
questions till we get to that segment. But if you want to give us a call, you sure can. All you got

01:44:56.420 --> 01:45:02.260
to do is have head over to our green room over at vog network.com slash discord. And I would

01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:07.060
encourage you to join the discord server and, you know, discuss things throughout the week with us.

01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:11.860
You know, a few stories in tonight's show roll were saved, or excuse me, were noted for the

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:17.460
show roll, because you posted them in discord, like the $70 game price, Microsoft, somebody had

01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:22.260
posted about that earlier in discord. And I think we have one coming up to that also is from discord.

01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:28.260
So yeah, we love to read and chat along with you all there. So I know everybody's trying to get

01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:32.980
you to join their discord server. But I promise, it's a lot of fun over vog network.com. We don't

01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:39.220
spam with the everyone in the here. So please, please head on over. All right. Loki, what do you

01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:48.260
have for us? Yeah, so there's this really cool mod that's been worked on by this guy. Janae Gosar,

01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:56.020
he's a developer in Slovenia. And it's basically a mod that takes the cities that you've created

01:45:56.020 --> 01:46:03.300
in SimCity 2000, and ports them over to Minecraft. So these said, basically, the reason

01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:09.060
why he made it was because there have been other mods out there, they've put in the terrain from

01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:15.060
SimCity 2000 and import into Minecraft, but nothing with the buildings. So he went ahead

01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:21.700
and coded it himself. And so it actually uses the SCG format from SimCity 2000. And you can then

01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:26.420
pop it into Minecraft, it looks like he made it for a pretty old version of Minecraft, because

01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:34.660
looking at the one he's flying around in is, it looks pretty old. But it does mean it does create

01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:40.980
structures, at least in the areas where you would have had those buildings. And so you can even kind

01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:46.820
of walk around some of them as well. There's like some basic interiors on some of them. But yeah,

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:52.500
it's pretty cool. A very narrow use case for that, but still neat.

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:58.180
So I was finally pulling this up, so I could see this myself. But yeah, probably has a very

01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:02.420
limited use case. But it's one of those like, neat. So it's actually loading into save files

01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:05.700
from SimCity 2000 and converting into Minecraft, because that's pretty cool.

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:12.660
I think what it does is it takes the save file from SimCity and converts it into a Minecraft

01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:16.260
map. Yeah, as you can see, like looking at the textures and everything here, I mean,

01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:21.220
we probably like with some tweaking, you could probably make it look even better.

01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:25.140
Yeah, with the block palettes now, because I think, like I said, the version that he's running here

01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:29.220
just based off of the glass textures and stuff. Yeah, and the draw distance is much better now.

01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:35.060
Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is like this is very old. Like you could make this look way better now. But

01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:39.140
that's still neat, though. It's fine. It's still it's in the quite an accomplishment.

01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:43.780
Yeah, for sure. I mean, just that whole concept of like taking a save file in one game and using

01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:48.340
it in another like I love that. Like it reminds me of how like what was it your Mass Effect

01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:51.060
save file could be read by Frog Fractions too. Remember that?

01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:53.700
What? Why?

01:47:53.700 --> 01:48:00.500
I don't I don't it was part of the what? It was Frog Fractions, Loki. Why is the overarching

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.020
question? You know, that's

01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:04.420
But for what purpose did it do that? Like

01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:09.460
it was part it read something in this save file and affected the Frog Fractions story

01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:12.660
because that's what happens in Mass Effect. But also

01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:17.860
found that article from December 27 2016. Oh, really?

01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:21.780
Yeah, Frog Fractions 2. Right.

01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:32.340
And they said that it wanted to import data from Mass Effect 2 save files into Frog Fractions 2.

01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:40.340
Upon doing so a second screen pops up. Well, welcoming Commander Shepard. And they

01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:48.420
just it doesn't actually do anything. But it it welcomes you as Commander Shepard.

01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:54.260
Okay. Then that's more akin to Psycho Mantis reading your save card and seeing Oh,

01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:57.540
I see you like Castlevania. That type of thing.

01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:07.940
Or when Cloud is all crazy and he says Xenogears when Xenogears was coming out, but

01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:12.820
it was all spelled phonetically. As J-100 Matt making a good old

01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:17.460
SimCity action news report saying the sun has gone down and creepers are storming downtown if

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:26.020
you hear hissing run. If you again if if you don't understand the SimCity and anytime this

01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:31.460
fucking game comes up, we always reference the classic CD-ROM that had the action news and they

01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:39.620
were very poorly public access channel level acted bits that would announce when monsters

01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:43.620
were invading and all this it was just to show off the video on CD-ROM otherwise it was it was

01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:50.420
just fucking SimCity. But it was it was so bad it was good. Anyway. But these these games and

01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:53.140
these apps have come a long way haven't they Dark Sakura?

01:49:53.140 --> 01:50:06.260
And in fact, here's another development. There's an app called Calm, which is like a mindfulness

01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:18.420
app. And there it's going to have if you have a calm premium membership, you can actually have

01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:27.700
the ocean of Sea of Thieves or the ambient noise of Zeta Halo from Halo Infinite playing in the

01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:34.420
background while you're meditating and being all chill. If you aren't a member, you'll be able to

01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:39.780
access that service for three months with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. And then after that, if you

01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:47.380
want to keep using calm premium, you get a 50% off discount for the first year. Normally, the full

01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:56.660
year is like 70 bucks. So they say that they Xbox teamed up with calm to support players mental

01:50:56.660 --> 01:51:03.060
health and well being. It has a collection of Game Pass titles to address mental health as well.

01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:10.580
For you know, to give a sense of escapism like Persona five Royal Hellblade Sanua sacrifice

01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:17.700
unpacking and Stardew Valley. Fill a nine in chat asking a good question here saying do other

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:23.700
people use video game music for meditation and relaxation? I listened to Wow, and Minecraft a

01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:31.220
lot to chill and relax. Minecraft music is super relaxing. Yeah. It's just it's interesting to me

01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:36.580
to hear Halo alongside calm. I get that it's like ambient spaceship noises, basically. But

01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:43.220
I just think of like, Xbox Live back in the day during Halo three, and I think stressed. That's

01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:49.460
the other app. So anyway, yeah, deezerama SS persona five Royal should not be a game listed

01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:54.180
for mental health. But it's it's it's not the game. It's the ambient noises and the

01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:58.900
the sound effects and that whole thing. Oh, this one actually is a game that's listed

01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:05.860
as to help. Oh, is it escapism or something? Oh, interesting. Well, aren't a lot of video

01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:16.180
games escapism at the end of the day, I guess. Interesting. All right. Well, moving on. Let's go

01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:22.580
back over to Loki. Yes, it's another week of what did Nintendo cancel this time? Or I should say

01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:27.620
what did Nintendo cancel that someone else was working on this time. And today's episode is going

01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:36.660
to be followed by or it is actually I believe did you knows gaming. It was the heroes of Hyrule was

01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:45.460
a video they were doing about a DS game called heroes of Hyrule, which was a tactic. But Nintendo

01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:52.260
has struck down because Nintendo being Nintendo. It was it was a pretty good video was a long one.

01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:59.940
And they even put out like a bounty for, for something about it. But um, but yeah, they did

01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:04.820
a really in depth episode. It was a really good one. I'm glad I got to see it before it was taken

01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:13.540
down. Yeah, so of course, you know, you know, this is the heroes of Hyrule video was created

01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:18.100
using the same process and video editing style for most of the videos on the channel. What sets

01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:23.220
the video apart is that one of the few videos on the channel that documents piece of Nintendo

01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:31.940
history that was first uncovered and reported on by us. But yeah, so that's unfortunate. It says

01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:37.860
we've heard from several sources during the videos production that Nintendo was were becoming upset

01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:43.540
with the amount of former Nintendo employees that were willing to talk about and share material from

01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:48.260
unreleased games, failed pitches and other canceled projects. This did not deter us and

01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:53.220
will not deter us from documenting video game history. As it should, as it shouldn't.

01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:59.380
They do amazing stuff. And I interesting I did not know it was obvious I didn't see the video

01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:04.180
but dark soccer kind of you bring up that bounty and I wonder if there's something about that,

01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:11.060
that Nintendo really didn't like. I don't know. It's interesting. I don't know. I don't know. I

01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:20.820
mean, it was, there was a lot more in the video. They really did have a lot of, a lot of former

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:27.140
employees talking as well, different, different like drawings and some different things that were

01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:33.300
submitted. And, you know, the few screenshots, you know, there was about, they did a lot of digging

01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:39.780
because this had been really buried. Yeah. Yeah. It had been pretty damn buried. Let me ask a silly

01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:43.620
question, but I'm sure it's something someone on the internet saying this somewhere. Do you think

01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:49.940
Nintendo pulls something like this? Cause they're planning on bringing it back? No. Or was this so

01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:53.940
far gone? I think they're just, I think they're just doing this because it's, it's showing

01:54:54.980 --> 01:55:01.060
Zelda stuff. And so they're like, no, that's so weird. They could, they could benefit from some

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:05.620
of that. Yeah. It's a part of video game history, you know, and I can't see in chats as Nintendo

01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:10.260
preservation. What's that? Yeah. It's, it's so wild. It's a copyright strike.

01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:14.500
It's just like the old, um, remember the old copies of Nintendo power that were in the

01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:19.140
archive or whatever those got struck down too. So it's, it's, yeah. Cause that was really hurting

01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:26.500
the bottom line. Yeah. But it's not anything. It's just, they're being jerks or protecting their IPs.

01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:30.340
That's what it's always Nintendo didn't do it. They would, you wouldn't be able to have their

01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:34.980
IPs anymore. It's like, I don't know about that though. Like they're not really, it's not like

01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:41.140
someone's creating a game called Zelda out there that that's a little different than someone making

01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:45.940
a documentary about a game that was canceled. That's not protecting their ID. That's just like,

01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:51.700
we're just not suing you because that's, it's not something that was worth our time.

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:57.460
People do like the unauthorized behind the toll scene story about the cast of full house and

01:55:57.460 --> 01:56:01.860
things like that, or these books and stuff. They don't get shut down, you know, even though the

01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:06.020
stories are less than kind to some of the people that were on it, you know, it's one of those,

01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:11.220
they don't, they can't shut that stuff down. It's, it's documentary from people that were there

01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:16.260
telling what's going on and sometimes interpreted into a lifetime movie and that stuff. Or what was

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:22.020
the other one they did recently, the saved by the bell, uh, behind the scenes thing. And that was a,

01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:27.540
you know, disaster too, but you can't stop that. So it's, it's wild to me that Nintendo can get

01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:31.620
away with it, but it's because YouTube unfortunately doesn't tend to side with the content creators,

01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:33.380
even though I thought they were supposed to start doing that.

01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:37.540
It's well, right. But it's there. Well, they're not going to take a stance at all,

01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:43.060
but it's more of, there is a process in place for this, but what that process would be is that

01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:50.260
you counterclaim it or you, you say, listen, you know, I am, you know, not,

01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:54.580
I'm counterclaiming your claim or something like that. Basically saying that, no, your claim is

01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:58.900
wrong. I am free to use this. And then you take it to the courts and then tend to win because they

01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:03.300
have more money than you. That's, that's really what it comes down to. And so, because people

01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:07.140
don't want to take it that far. Cause they're like, it's not worth, not worth it for me to

01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:13.460
be litigious about this, um, and defend this in court. So then of course, they're going to bully

01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:17.060
them into whatever they want. Uh, did your, um, S and chat says,

01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:21.380
Nintendo of Japan doesn't understand. That's why this is all coming out of the Japanese office.

01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:26.900
And that honestly, you write. It's slowly going to erode away though. Um,

01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:34.340
they're good will. Again, we need the gaming press that gets access to Nintendo to ask these

01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:37.940
types of accountability questions. I realized they don't want to pick up the phone and just say,

01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:43.060
why did you pull that video? But Nintendo will be sooner rather than later promoting a new Zelda

01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:51.060
game, Tears of the Kingdom. And when that game is being promoted, it needs to be asked, um, why,

01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:56.100
you know, uh, since we're talking about a Zelda game, you, uh, once had a Zelda game that was in

01:57:56.100 --> 01:58:00.260
production and there was a YouTube video that was trying to document some of this for history to,

01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:03.140
why did you copyright strike this? Why did you go after it?

01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:07.860
They just promoted that game at the game. Then I'm saying that, but this is what the

01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:14.500
gaming press isn't doing that they need to do. Ask these questions. When they're trying to promote

01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:17.940
their product, you got to follow up with the tough questions, but they don't want to because

01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:19.140
they'll lose access. I didn't realize they were working with

01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:25.700
Zeltik on, on the video though. Zeltik is a really good, uh, Zelda lore person.

01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:28.180
Yeah. Anyway.

01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:34.660
I was trying to check some of the, the archives, see if maybe someone had put it up.

01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:38.580
I'm sure someone's already. Oh, I'm sure once on the internet,

01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:43.380
always on the internet. If that master file is probably a torrent somewhere now. So, you know,

01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:48.580
I'm, I'm sure somebody within the, did you know, gaming side probably didn't let that

01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:53.780
video go to waste and I don't blame them whatsoever. All right. Uh, well speaking of

01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:59.140
Nintendo, I got one more story tonight and it's about Mario Kart 8, uh, Mario Kart 8 deluxe,

01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:03.220
which of course was released on the Nintendo switch some time ago, but remains one of the

01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:06.980
best-selling games on the platform. Like who doesn't have that game yet? I don't know. But

01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:13.780
anyway, uh, wave three of the booster course pack just came out and with it, a new customizability

01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:18.420
option for the items. Unfortunately, no, it doesn't let you customize the actual items.

01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:23.060
That would be kind of fun to turn the mushrooms and things, uh, into other items. But

01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:28.100
what it does let you do is it lets you, when you are going to play online,

01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:33.700
you can play a custom items mode via the free update that brought the booster pack as well.

01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:40.660
You can choose which items are used in offline versus races, meaning if you want to disable the

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:48.980
blue shell and only the blue shell, you can do that now. Yay. So that's the whole type of thing

01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:53.860
that custom items is doing is, uh, allowing you to turn on and off what items you want to have

01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:57.620
in the race. Seems like such an obvious thing, but it's nice that it's there now, you know,

01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:01.620
probably one of those things that really did come through with feedback about I'm sick and tired of

02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:07.300
those fucking blue shells. What can we do about it? So there you go. Uh, my depth also points out

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:13.700
the lightning item got nerfed that I did not realize. Interesting. It probably needed it.

02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:16.820
Let's be real, but you could also turn that off. If you don't like that item,

02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:20.980
you could, you could have it be, uh, green shells and bananas only. If that's what you want.

02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:27.540
I'll just as fuck the blue shell. I actually have a pin on my old purse. That's the blue

02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:35.060
shell that says fuck you. It's all blue shells. It's all or play a giant one

02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:40.660
just so I could throw it at people. That would actually be really funny is like play a race.

02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:50.020
That's all blue shells. Like everybody carefully not being in first right up until the end. That'd

02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:56.420
be really funny. All right. Uh, that's, that's it for the stories we had on deck tonight. Um,

02:00:56.420 --> 02:01:01.780
so we're going to look to you all in chat. If you have some questions for us over at twitch.tv slash

02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:06.020
vog and network, we'll take those now. Uh, of course, if you want to, uh, give us a call,

02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:10.180
you sure can over at vog network.com slash discord, just join the green room and we'll

02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:14.260
get to some calls. Um, let me ask Loki though, real quick, if there's any, uh, last minute

02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:19.220
stories or other things that came up that you want to bring up. Uh, right. Games is doing net ease

02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:26.740
over hyper fronts saying that it's copying Valorant. They do look very similar. Um,

02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:33.540
little too close. Yeah. Uh, all of our creative choices are mirrored in net eases game. Uh,

02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:38.580
we don't think that changing the color of the character ability or slightly modifying the visual

02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:43.300
appearance changes the fact that it's copyright infringement. It's like the old saying you can

02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:48.100
put lipstick on a pig, but it's still pig. I love the fact that he added that the end,

02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:55.540
um, comments in chat, um, on other games, uh, Phil of nine says I was shook when I logged into spell

02:01:55.540 --> 02:02:01.060
break today and saw a countdown timer for the server shutting down. I had no idea. Only 29

02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:05.060
days left. Yeah. I missed that. That game was doing the same thing for a DVD mobile.

02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:11.060
DVD mobile's shutting down. It's going to be delisted, I think for revamp or something,

02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:17.140
but it has to do with net ease. Oh, interesting. Huh? Yeah. Like they're saying like, if you want

02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:22.740
to download it, do it now, which I think I already have it on both of my devices, even though I don't

02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:28.180
play it. I think I had it once on my phone, but I got rid of it for the space. But maybe if I

02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:33.300
have it in my history, I can still grab it. I don't know. Weird. Uh, that sometimes,

02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:40.260
no, if it's, if the content is removed, then it's gone. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:45.140
Then you'll need to like that, that may be emulator that made its way onto the store

02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:48.740
that I grabbed on my iPad before it was removed. You certainly can't redownload that. So yeah,

02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:56.580
they can, they can PT things that they have to, I get it. Um, let's see. Um, I can't see talking

02:02:56.580 --> 02:03:00.900
about the Mario Kart story pointing out. It could be good for tournaments. That's true,

02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:03.140
but look out. Cause if you hold a Nintendo tournament,

02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:09.300
you might be up for a whole other disaster by the way. Didn't,

02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:14.340
did, uh, didn't, wasn't there more follow-up on that whole saga this week? Like that guy,

02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:18.820
that CEO resigned, I think I read. Yeah. They, they, they, they let the CEO go,

02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:23.540
but well, he resigned to CEO, but he still owns the thing. So I don't know if that really makes

02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:31.380
a difference allegedly. Um, so yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Uh, great question from, I can't

02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:36.420
see in our chat. How do we email questions? I have a big one for next time. Please participate

02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:41.700
at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send those emails, uh, fill of nine with a good

02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:46.740
question. What are y'all gaming over the holiday break? What are y'all gaming over the holiday

02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:52.900
break me? I don't have much of a holiday break, so I don't feel like I exactly have an opportunity

02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:57.460
to get caught up on a backlog, so to speak, but I really want to finish Pokemon scarlet.

02:03:57.460 --> 02:04:01.380
I really do. Like I'm missing these Charizard events and it's making me sad.

02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:04.740
So I want to do, I want to finish Pokemon scarlet. That's for sure.

02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:15.220
Um, um, I was going to say I'll do, uh, probably lead Minecraft. And then I do want to play high

02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:23.700
on life a little bit. Cause that looks stupid. Nice. Um, um, we're probably doing our, our retro

02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:31.540
game thing, um, on new year's Eve. So we'll see how that goes, but I'm going to keep playing the

02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:35.860
stuff I've been playing. I might want to make a cameo. I think I mentioned that last week.

02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:40.740
I'm booked until like nine 30, but you know, I'll come over for the actual countdown,

02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:48.020
play some pinball. And if you, and if you want to, you know, actually, uh, play, uh,

02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:54.100
on stream with me at some point too, or even not, I'm always down to play. I'm sure. Uh,

02:04:54.100 --> 02:04:58.660
another question in our chat. Hello. Hello. Uh, poncho 72 is in our chat. Longtime listener,

02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:02.660
first time viewer. Well, welcome. Thanks for being here poncho. Uh, I like the burger time

02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:07.780
mentioning. So when we, for those that are only on the podcast feed and haven't been here on Twitch,

02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:13.540
uh, poncho seat notices that I have an arcade one up, which is a burger time machine behind me.

02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:18.740
Essentially it's a data East collection because it has, you know, caveman ninja has bad dudes and

02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:23.620
karate champ are all on it as well. Um, but it's a burger time cabinet. And I always said from a

02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:28.100
long time ago that if I could ever get a burger time machine in my house, I'd get one and the

02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:32.660
arcade went up close enough. It's a limited edition too. They only made like 4,000 of them.

02:05:32.660 --> 02:05:38.420
And, um, I was hoping to move some things around this weekend, but, um,

02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:44.260
there's something waiting. That's all I'm going to say right now. I need to make a little space.

02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:47.700
So, uh, tune in next week. That should all be taken care of. I have to get a,

02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:52.660
I have to get an extension cord to set things up the way I want to, but, uh, stay tuned for that.

02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:57.940
But anyway, uh, the real question that poncho 72 had here was, do you guys have any thoughts on the

02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:05.060
Evercade thinking about getting one? Um, ironically, I mean, no Evercade, those, those

02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:11.140
Evercade are the, um, the little portable devices that have the cartridges with packs on them. And

02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:16.500
there was, there was a data East one recently because I think that data East one is on sale.

02:06:17.380 --> 02:06:25.300
Um, so, uh, yeah, I, I don't own one, so I can't give you impressions. Uh, but I, I kind of want

02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:29.380
one like that portable one that's coming out here. Pretty soon. They have a portable one and

02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:34.660
they have one that you hook up to your TV and like the cartridges work in both. Right. Yeah.

02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:39.220
It's all universal. Uh, as Joe and her mat says that Evercade exp was interesting. And then I saw

02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:43.780
that story about their entire stock being stolen. Yeah. But there's a lot of, like, there's a lot of

02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:47.940
cartridges for that, uh, Evercade thing now. Like, aren't they up to something like 20 different

02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:52.900
cartridges at least. Oh, it's more than that. I think. Yeah. It's really been growing. I,

02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:59.060
I want to get one. Maybe, uh, I was going to say I'll ask Santa for one, but Santa already, uh,

02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:08.100
took care of business this year. So maybe in the future, 27. Okay. There's 27 retro cartridges.

02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:12.260
So like a links collection, a code master in television, those types of questions,

02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:17.060
37, I think. And then for arcade cartridges, they have another eight,

02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:23.460
but then they have a Commodore 64 cartridge as well, which, you know, I'm all about that. So,

02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:27.300
yeah, I kind of want an Evercade honestly. Yeah. They have like the Intellivision stuff. There's

02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:34.260
also, um, uh, the, some of the nest maker people have games on there. Yeah. So it's not just love

02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:40.340
to get mine on there. Yeah. Right. They have two, they have two collections of those. I will sell

02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:47.460
I will sell very cheap, like very, very cheap. Yeah. You can just put that on there and fine.

02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:51.220
You need to email somebody over there. How do I get myself one of the collections or something

02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:56.020
or figure out the producers of the prior ones and figure out their email or something. There's

02:07:56.020 --> 02:08:00.020
way there's ways to figure it out. Like, I know the people like that have had games. I like,

02:08:00.020 --> 02:08:04.820
I recognize their games. I they're in the community. I just don't know like how you

02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:10.260
would even get on these cards. Yeah. Pancho 72 says I almost bought the home and handheld one

02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:16.180
for $150. So yeah, I I'm thinking about it. Like, you know, it's obviously this time of year kind

02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:20.900
of stinks money wise, but that might be something I'm eyeing for early next year. I think the

02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:24.980
Evercade is a pretty cool concept. So yeah, the home one now is only a hundred bucks too.

02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:31.060
I still know what it is. I'm, I'm wanting, that's lots of steam gift cards.

02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:37.220
So I can buy one game. Oh, the Marvel $100 costume edition.

02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:42.740
Yeah. I want to play midnight sons and I want the season pass. So the ultimate edition is like

02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:44.980
a hundred bucks. I understand.

02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:51.700
It's annoying me and my love of having all the outfits and characters.

02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:58.980
No, I get it. I get it. Um, as Joe and Matt says, I did see a review that the older Evercade

02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:03.860
cartridges have problems with the exp, mostly just size. Like you can't get the card out of

02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:08.500
the system when it's in, but there are a fair, apparently fixing the newer exp models. The one,

02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:13.140
that's the ones that were stolen cheese. That's too bad about the stolen ones, but

02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:17.460
well, thank you for the question Pancho. And if you do get your hands on an Evercade,

02:09:17.460 --> 02:09:21.860
I'd love to hear more about it. Um, and I, I, it doesn't sound like anyone in chat has one yet.

02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:26.180
It's definitely on my radar, uh, just because, uh, I love the idea of the, the fact that the

02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:31.220
cartridges are home and portable. Um, but just to get the arcade machines, you know,

02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:36.980
pretty relatively reliably on like the big screen, I think is always a lot of fun. So nice.

02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:41.940
All right. Well with that, I think we're out of stories and that means we're out of show. So we

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:46.340
should go around and get everybody's final thoughts. Yeah. I, I, I, Oh yeah. I should,

02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:50.340
I guess I should. I knew that, but the listeners didn't. Sorry. Yes. There was no email tonight.

02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:53.540
Participate at orange launch radio.com. If you'd like to send an email for a future week,

02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:58.020
which it sounds like somebody in chat did, which is great. Um, all right. Let's, uh,

02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:00.980
go around and get everybody's final thoughts. I will say here at the end of the show though,

02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:05.380
thank you so much for, uh, downloading our show and listening to it. Uh, or if you were here live,

02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:09.220
that's awesome too. If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend,

02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:12.180
uh, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:16.900
but we need more voices here to put out on air. So, uh, a nice five star review on a site like

02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:21.780
Spotify, iTunes, wherever it is, you found the show that goes an awful long way. Uh, also just

02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:25.540
sharing on social media is great too. Uh, you know, whatever you can do to get the word out,

02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:31.700
we appreciate it all. Thank you so much. Um, that's all I have to say here. So let's get

02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:36.420
final thoughts, dark Sakura. I imagine you are doing some Debbie delight tonight. I saw

02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:44.500
an RN chat. So I imagine y'all are off to have some fun. Yep. Go ahead and move on into the queue,

02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:49.700
opening up my game. And I would really appreciate it for people to hang around and chat with me

02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:54.020
because that's the most fun part is being able to have a peanut gallery.

02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:59.060
Uh, any final thoughts tonight? That was my final thought. Oh, okay.

02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:04.420
All right. Oh no. Uh, give me steam cards. That's my final thought.

02:11:04.420 --> 02:11:10.340
All right. Oh, what's your, what's your username? Dark Sarah, dark Sakura. Okay.

02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:14.420
Just making sure we send this, just making sure we send those steam cards to the right place.

02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:20.580
That's all. You'll see a neon cherry blossom. Okay. I'm pretty sure that's the one I'm using.

02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:25.620
All right. All right. You can always issue a correction on social media if you need to. All

02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:30.980
right. Have a good one. Have a good stream. You too. Uh, Loki, your final thought for tonight.

02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:37.220
Uh, hopefully you'll see more content for me this week. I'm hoping to get a lot of it out.

02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:41.220
Sounds good. Sounds like you're going to be hard at work this week.

02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:45.300
Yeah, hopefully. Uh, my final thought tonight. I don't, I don't

02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:52.260
have a lot. I'm just, um, just thankful to still be doing this show after all this time. And the

02:11:52.260 --> 02:11:57.540
fact that there's people that listen to it means the world. And, uh, yeah, just, uh, the holiday

02:11:57.540 --> 02:12:01.780
season is really sneaking up on us. So I hope everyone has a good one and, uh, 2023 will be

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:08.100
here before we know it, which I can't believe I'm going to be 45 next year. Like time fricking flies.

02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:11.940
Can't believe it. All right. Well, that does it for another episode of orange launch radio.

02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:16.180
I hope you all have a wonderful night. Thank you so much. And we will see you next time. Bye
