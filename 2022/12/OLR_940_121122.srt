1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,360
I'm pretty sure I remember video games being 50 US dollars, yet seeing a $49.99 price tag

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,660
in stores seems unfamiliar. I'm of course very acquainted with the $60 price point.

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,340
This week, Microsoft stated it's planned to join the $70 club for all of its first-party

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,180
titles too, and now two-thirds of console manufacturers and game publishers have made

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,340
the Switch. That just leaves the Switch.

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,620
This is the intro that references inflation. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts,

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,900
Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,700
Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:45,660
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,660
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back at live once again with

11
00:00:52,660 --> 00:01:01,060
episode number 940 of our show tonight, December the 11th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:06,740
I'm here every week with my co-hosts. First off, say hi to Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,420
Oh, hello. Hello. I like, you can, you're spotting, I don't think this is a new wig,

14
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,180
but you're spotting a nice looking wig tonight.

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,380
It's, it's, I was going to wear the, the, the red lace front, you know, the one I really

16
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,820
like, but I don't know. I just felt like black hair went with green makeup.

17
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,460
It works. It works. I do. I see it on the ice. Well, I know we're talking a lot of visuals,

18
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,700
so sorry to the podcast crowd. We do love you all that subscribe to us as Spotify,

19
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,340
iTunes. Well, don't forget, you know, folks sometimes make clips of the show,

20
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,900
but you can also always access the video archive over at twitch.tv slash vog network because

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,060
we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific,

22
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,260
usually right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash

23
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,900
vog network, VOG network. I say usually after Bobby Black Wolf, because he is not,

24
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,500
he wasn't on tonight. He's taking some Bobby time this week, actually some Bobby and Mrs. Bobby time

25
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,860
this week. So they, they are doing some other stuff tonight. So he will be back on December

26
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,220
the 25th. Even though it is a pretty well known holiday, he still plans to be back that night

27
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,420
because I believe as he put it, he does all of his celebrations on the Eve, which may actually

28
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,300
end up being the same thing I do this year. I don't know. We'll see. I'm still trying to

29
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,140
figure that out. So hopefully I'll know for next week because believe it or not, we're two weeks

30
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:35,780
away from December the 25th. So, and then we're three weeks away from new year's. So it's-

31
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,940
One week away from Hanukkah and that's important.

32
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:43,060
That is, it's, it's, it's, it's a little more, kind of at the end of December this year,

33
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,540
as opposed to, I think last year it was practically in November, wasn't it?

34
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,700
Yeah. And actually I got something stuck in my head and like got all my stuff out a week early

35
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,300
and then like, oh. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

36
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,900
Hello.

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,940
Hi. And that is not a wig. That is all his natural hair, folks. Just so you know. Loki,

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,500
I heard Dark Soccer, I think, recognized the game playing behind you tonight. But what is,

39
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
what is the game behind you playing tonight? Why?

40
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:17,140
It is a stall. It is a game from the Saturn. It's one of the first games I played on the Saturn.

41
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,260
And it just, it's like, I remember back then it was like, oh man, it's like an anime. It's

42
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,700
like so amazing. Um, yeah. I mean, it had really cool cut scenes and everything. And it was a

43
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,820
really nice, uh, like 2d platformer. And it flowed. Excellent music. Excellent music.

44
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,660
I just remember being enamored with the backgrounds.

45
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,620
It's all the colors.

46
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,260
It's another one of those games where it's like, we didn't think video game graphics could get any

47
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,380
prettier. And then here we are. I remember the first time I played Mario Brothers 2, actually,

48
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,140
Super Mario Brothers 2, which we all know was a remake of a Japanese game. But you know, I didn't

49
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,420
know that when I was what, 10 years old and that game came out. So, um, when I saw that game for

50
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,660
the very first time, I was like, oh my gosh, it's like a cartoon. I'm playing a cartoon on my TV.

51
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,780
These graphics are so good. Cause remember, you know, my first system was an Atari 2600,

52
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:14,020
you know, and like many systems of that same era, albeit, you know, Coleco or whatever the graphics

53
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,780
were pretty blocky. I mean, it was cool as hell at the time, because again, it was like, oh,

54
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:23,060
I'm playing these on my TV at home and not in an arcade. But, uh, like Mario Brothers 2 was the

55
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,380
first time I remember thinking I'm playing a cartoon like legit. So. I mean, to be fair,

56
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,980
like back then the resolution of everything wasn't very big anyways. And, you know, coming

57
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,540
from like playing stuff on like the Atari 2600 or something like that, it's like, yeah, it's a

58
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:47,860
massive jump in fidelity. So. Well, in a standard TV didn't show much more than 6, 64480. In fact,

59
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,180
I think it was less than that, to be honest. So, uh, I was like 240 and I was like 240. So,

60
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,020
uh, the fact, you know, that it was that perfect revolution for a TV, you know, the NES was just,

61
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,460
yeah, made, made for some incredible graphics. And then when we got to Super Nintendo, oh boy,

62
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,700
like then we really got some cartoon graphics on that one. Yeah. Going to the chat over at

63
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,300
twitch.tv slash vog network. Orange right says that ending in Super Mario Brothers 2 as well.

64
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,380
Oh yeah. You remember that ending in Mario Brothers 2 when you see, you know, Mario sleeping

65
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,820
and like that look when you consider that that's all like sprite based work basically put together

66
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,820
to kind of make that it's really, it was really incredible what they, what they did with that

67
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,940
whole, uh, ending sequence in that game. That looked really, really cool that I loved when

68
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,300
video games had such a rewarding ending like that. Right? Like didn't the Mario Brothers 2 ending

69
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,620
feel really good for that era? Like it was much better than the screen that said,

70
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,380
congratulations. The story is happy and press start to continue. Like it was much,

71
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,100
much more satisfying than something like that. Right. Even though when you beat a hard as hell

72
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:00,820
game like ghosts and goblins, you'll, you'll take whatever the game gives you. Um, yeah,

73
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,860
as 200 Matt points out, Super Mario Brothers 2 was a dream and Super Mario Brothers 3 was a stage

74
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,620
play. So what would Super Mario Brothers 4 be? The matrix? Because we never really did have a

75
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:18,180
Mario Brothers 4, although I guess Mario world actually numbered Super Mario 4 at its original

76
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,820
conception. I was going to say Mario world is technically, uh, labeled that, but I guess,

77
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,020
I guess, uh, they didn't actually consider it. It wasn't like part of a show like the others,

78
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,540
I guess. So, uh, anyway, looking for some other comments in chat. Hello. Hello. Uh,

79
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,540
hope everybody's doing well. Uh, dark to see us as I was just about to bring up ghosts and

80
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,300
goblins. So yeah, it's a, it's a memorable ending if nothing else anyway. When it actually ended.

81
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,060
All right, let's move on. We have some gaming news to get into tonight. And of course the big

82
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,140
thing everybody's talking about this week was the game awards because you know, I gotta,

83
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:01,540
I gotta hand it to Jeff. He did manage to create E3 level kind of announcements in December. Like

84
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,340
there's been good years. There's been not so good years of the game awards. I would say when it

85
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,940
comes to the, the magnitude of the announcements he had planned and the ceremony itself for the

86
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,980
most part, um, I would say it was absolutely one of the better years for the game awards.

87
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,660
Um, definitely some places to improve. I think for me, the running time was really,

88
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,820
remember when he said it wasn't going to be as long as last year and to be fair, it wasn't,

89
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,180
but didn't the steam deck things say they were only going to give away like 150 steam decks

90
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,420
tops or it was like, they were planning for 150 and I think it went, it was about what,

91
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,660
three hours and 15 minutes if you count the free show, right?

92
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:48,500
Yeah, it was pretty long and that steam deck giveaway thing was kind of, um, it was a mess.

93
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,300
Their player didn't work very well. Cause I actually watched it through that.

94
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,380
Thanks to my internet. I had that playing on one monitor and then I had the 4k version playing on

95
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,780
my main monitor. Right? Yeah. So it was a mess and like, and there is a funny, uh,

96
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,180
Oh God, there's, there's a funny screenshot that's out there. Like the very first one

97
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,820
was like a user by the name of like milf lover or something like that.

98
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,340
Oh yeah. Yeah. One of the first award winners. Yeah. So it was, it was just like

99
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,780
milf Hunter says Mike down Hunter. Oh, you're right. Milf Hunter. Yeah.

100
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:32,100
So everyone's just like, Oh, GG. And then eventually it like started breaking down

101
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,260
because it stopped showing the names and it started showing the steam ID. So everybody

102
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,020
assumed, Oh, the bots are getting it though. The bots are getting it. It's fun. It was a fun

103
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,140
distraction to watch chat one. Like, you know, I didn't want to watch what was on screen or

104
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,940
anything, but yeah, lots of big announcements and everything. So, um, can I, can I just,

105
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,460
can I speak before we get into the specifics? Can we just kind of speak in some generalities here?

106
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,700
I want to well also, and I want to go to Mike Defton chat who says it went for two hours and

107
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,500
40 something minutes. Does that count the pre-show or not? Because I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

108
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:11,860
The pre-show counts for me. Like, because especially when the very first thing they drop

109
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,940
on us is that dead cells, Castlevania. And I'm, I'm actually a little disappointed that that just

110
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,980
isn't a standalone game because when I first saw that I was super hype. I was like, yes,

111
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,860
this is what I want Konami to do. Give your fucking IPs to people that know how to use them.

112
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,300
Dead cell developers, great choice to do something with Castlevania. But it turns out it's

113
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,660
just an expansion for dead cells, which is okay. I'm still interested in that. That's fine. It's a

114
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,940
better direction than, you know, Castlevania probably done in house. But, but that was the

115
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,100
first announcement. And then what then they followed that up with, like, like there was like

116
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,700
some major announcements in that 30 minute little block.

117
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,180
Yeah, there was a new Hellboy game.

118
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,620
Yeah, that was. Sorry, Miltonias Games in chat says pre-show totally counts if it has world

119
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,660
premieres. I that's, that's what I'm saying. And honestly, they just need to fold that into the

120
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,740
main show. Like, let the ostrich lady or flamingo lady, excuse me, let the flamingo lady because

121
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:17,140
her outfit looked a little flamingo. Let that pre-show get folded into the main show. And she

122
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,940
can still, you know, have her thing. She's been doing that a few years. It should just really be

123
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,140
part of the main show. At this point. I'm not I'm not sure why they call that a pre-show. There

124
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,020
was the news coming out of that was way too big. One other thing I want to get out of the way

125
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,460
because everybody's talking about it. Too many people are talking about it. So it needs to be

126
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:42,500
addressed. And that is the literal child that got up on stage at the end and said whatever he said,

127
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,220
after Elden Ring won its Game of the Year award, right? We all know he went up there and said,

128
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,900
Bill Clinton, something something, which was interesting because social media immediately

129
00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:00,180
said it was a coded white supremacy message. But unfortunately, social media has a tendency to run

130
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:07,140
with headline and literal Twitter size thing and not facts. And the fact is that he was a young,

131
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,980
because these these outlets have interviewed him after the fact they're giving him way too much

132
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,940
attention. But whatever it was, here's that attention you ordered. He was a literal child,

133
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:26,820
15 year Jewish, I believe, IRL shitposter. That's all that was. That was an IRL shitpost.

134
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,260
And the type of behavior you would expect out of a 15 year old child. That's all I'm going to say

135
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:40,500
about that. Because the onus on that moment, I think goes to Jeff and his security team and all

136
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,460
of that, like, how in the fuck did that kid get up on stage? So many, like, questions in the way

137
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:51,940
him being Jewish has to do with it. How How did a 15 year old get into the event in the first place?

138
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:58,980
Where? How did like, I'm assuming he's not from the area. So how did he get to the area to be on

139
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,740
the show? Well, anyone could buy a ticket. They were selling the tickets. Right. But like, you

140
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:09,380
know, I mean, if my child just disappeared. Oh, yeah, true. Where were the parents? Right? Yeah,

141
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,340
oh, yeah, you're just flying to California. Okay, sure. Bye.

142
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Yeah, that's the thing. And Mike Deaf says, how the fuck did they let that happen at all? It could

143
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:27,540
have been so worse. Yes, it could have been an actual really bad message that gets out there.

144
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:35,940
And you know, is is gives the show and gamers in general, a really bad reputation. And that is the

145
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,340
type of unfortunately, shenanigans that and I, you know, Jeff Keeley's pissed that that happened,

146
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,580
especially when he goes out there and he tweets, we arrested the person that did the thing.

147
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,100
And you know, you could see that look on his face just looked like he was just pissed at the end

148
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,180
there. But the reality is, the fact that you let that happen in your security that you contract

149
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,220
with let that happen is what is holding your show back from being the Oscars. Although at the same

150
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,460
time, you look at what happened at the Oscars this past year, and I guess they don't have much

151
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:13,300
security either. So I'm not sure what this says about award shows at all. Right. Yeah, it's a

152
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,700
weird scenario. And it but it was like, almost like, it was almost nothing, because it's like,

153
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,140
okay, he said something weird, and then he disappeared. Like, and that was it. Like,

154
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,420
I don't know, I didn't even realize it was somebody that wasn't, I thought it was somebody

155
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:34,260
making a really bad joke. And then like, I didn't understand. I'm like, whatever. People are gonna

156
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,580
be weird, I guess. Yeah, I didn't realize it was like someone that wasn't with the group. And

157
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:44,020
that's fine. I mean, like, I get it. But like, yeah, it could have been worse. But it was also

158
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,020
really stupid to like, I don't know. Oh, yeah. And that's true. One of Matt brings up a point

159
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,340
and why I addressed it earlier. So when Matt says the reason why the Jewish thing came into play was

160
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,380
because people thought the Bill Clinton thing was a veiled anti Semitic comment. So Jason Schreier

161
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:03,540
interviewed him in Hebrew, and he understood it, and then pretended not to. So my point was

162
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Yeah, right. It was that Jason Schreier. He's a sneaky, sneaky, sneaky guy. But that was so I

163
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,060
mean, again, it was a good, that's what a journalist does to pull a fast one. Anyway,

164
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,940
but but yeah, but but my point- Oh no, granted, not not everybody understands Hebrew.

165
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:27,060
But the fact that everybody was running with it was a terrible thing that this child said on

166
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:33,460
stage. No, it was just a shitpost. But granted, we need to take a moment to realize it could have

167
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,420
been a really bad thing. So anyway, that's all the attention I want to give that it's more than

168
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:44,180
enough done. The other thing that I think was the big like everybody's talking about it moment was

169
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,660
Christopher Judge's acceptance speech. Now look, I got nothing but love in my heart for Christopher

170
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,020
Judge. He did a great job and God of War Ragnarok. We all know his speech went on a little long.

171
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,260
And this is why the Oscars does a nominees luncheon ceremony to talk about these sorts

172
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,460
of things about keeping it short. I also want to point out something that really struck me

173
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,420
about that speech. And then the subsequent speeches were that they started to raise the

174
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,260
music up on Christopher Judge about five minutes into that speech, where I think the Oscars gives

175
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:23,060
you about 45 seconds. They started to raise me five minutes. Every subsequent speaker that night,

176
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:29,940
they started to raise the music a lot faster. That was a little inconsistent. And in my opinion,

177
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,140
kind of didn't look very professional at that point, because they they weren't doing it

178
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,300
consistently. And it looked like they were doing it because of what happened with Christopher Judge.

179
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:47,300
I just think that was a nobody told him how to do it. So he really just spoke from the heart

180
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,660
and kept speaking and kept speaking. And I understand there's a lot to say.

181
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:59,860
Look, this bitch and my bitches do a two to three hour show every week about video games. Okay.

182
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,900
Like, I get it. There's sometimes a lot to say. But in the context of these award shows where

183
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,380
you're paying people to be there and so forth, you do have to ask people to tighten it up a

184
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:15,380
little bit, right, you know, and plan on only the 45 seconds. So again, again, I felt that I felt

185
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:21,940
that a lot less on Christopher Judge and more on nobody preparing Christopher Judge or any

186
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,900
of the nominees. And then I guess the last thing I could say is the teleprompter seemed to have

187
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:32,580
problems a couple of times in the night. Al Pacino did not seem to be a fan of the teleprompter.

188
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:40,740
Roberta Williams, I could see was not enjoying the teleprompter either. But it is what it is.

189
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:48,340
It's a teleprompter, right? So yeah. Let's see going to some comments in chat. Jessica in chat

190
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,500
says these people always saying something incomprehensible. Whatever happened to just

191
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,260
mooning the audience? I do want to remind that that child was 15. So not that one. But if we're

192
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:04,020
going to throw back to the Oscars streaker, who was 20 or 30, you know, then that Yeah, whatever,

193
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,860
whatever happened to a good old streaker? Let's let's let's

194
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,780
become desensitized to butts.

195
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:14,820
Let's how about that? I'd like to put out a challenge. Not really, because I don't want to

196
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:19,620
get in trouble. But I'd like to put in a fake joke challenge. I want to see a streaker at the

197
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,580
Game Awards 2023. Let's of age please. You know,

198
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:31,140
I referenced one of my favorite ever things to have ever come out of the Oscars. And it was the

199
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,540
Will Ferrell and Jack Black singing the Get Off the Stage song.

200
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,700
They said, Did you know that the Get Off the Stage song has words?

201
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,580
And I was like, every time I hear any Get Off the Stage music, I just think of them.

202
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,220
It's like the look at Catherine Zeta Jones. She's snoring.

203
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,580
Yeah, yeah. So that's the whole thing. If they gave lyrics to it, I bet everyone would would

204
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,740
actually get off the stage and just listen to the song.

205
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,580
I would worry about a comedy bit at the Game Awards, though. Well, I guess they sometimes

206
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,940
do like, they did like the animal thing, which was cute. Like, I'm always going to have room

207
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,740
in my heart for a Muppets moment. But it really just made me go, I wish the Muppets would host

208
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,180
the Game Awards. Not that I have a problem with Geoff Keighley. But I just feel like the whole

209
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,140
thing would just have more pep in it if the Muppets hosted, you know, like, Geoff Keighley

210
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,860
does feel a little vanilla at this point. And I don't know a nice way to say it. I'm not trying

211
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,740
to be mean. Again, I liked this award show a lot more than most of the others. It's just,

212
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,780
I feel like a little spice it up a little bit.

213
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:34,900
I don't know.

214
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,700
It also feels weird to have like Animal there without like, it tying into like, literally

215
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,500
anything.

216
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,740
Yeah, that's like, where was Miss Piggy unavailable? I mean, but again, I like Animal,

217
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:50,100
but it did seem like why that particular Muppet? I don't know. Where's the love for Janice and her

218
00:18:50,100 --> 00:19:00,420
band? Or like, if we're gonna do some deep cut and Muppets. Let's get Scooter and Skeeter out

219
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,220
there to reaffirm that they are indeed Muppet babies.

220
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:12,100
All right. Yeah, that's a good one. Orangewright and Chet says, people on Mastodon were saying,

221
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,660
where were Statler and Waldorf? Now those are the Muppets I want to see at the Game Awards.

222
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,940
Yes. Yes.

223
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,580
Because they knew they'd have nothing nice to say.

224
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,860
That's great.

225
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,900
Then they just need to start like piping up when people take too long with their speeches.

226
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,380
Yeah.

227
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,180
Ripping into them.

228
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,220
You hear the small voice from the balcony. Boo! Move! Leave!

229
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,700
I would never do that, Chris, for Judge, though. But Questbuster says-

230
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,260
You know what I mean.

231
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,260
Yeah. Questbuster says, I'm sure Judge as an actor for years knew that he was running the

232
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,420
clock, but he was so emotionally invested in the moment alongside someone who was probably one of

233
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,660
the reasons for him getting into the craft in the first place. Oh, for sure. Again, I'm not really

234
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:58,500
faulting Christopher Judge in that scenario. I'm faulting what I believe or what I'm interpreting

235
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,980
was a lack of preparing Christopher Judge to say to all the nominees, okay, if you get selected,

236
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,980
you get a chance to go up on stage. Think about what you want to say in a minute. We have to limit

237
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,420
you to a minute, but we'll allow you to make a further statement online if you want to do that

238
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,140
at thegameawards.com, and we'll publish it on Twitter. But when you get 50 seconds in your

239
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,260
speech, you're going to hear the music come up, and that is the sign that we need you to wrap it

240
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,260
up. And then at a minute 15, we're going to take- like they need to just outline, this is how it's

241
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:30,900
going to go. And I don't think anybody did that. They need to make sure that they don't do it via

242
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:37,460
email, that they give them a physical card. That actually is a brilliant call out, because you're

243
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,460
right, it might have been in an email. I mean, people will gloss over email, and I bet anyone

244
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,340
who has any certain amount of notoriety is probably going to have people that check their

245
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:56,100
mail for them. Yeah, yeah. So I think that it needs to be sent out in a formal card. A card on

246
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:05,220
laminated. Something, an easy text, something that's eye-catching that says, here's how not to

247
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,940
be a shit. Do you think Jeff is- Do you think Jeff is going to send Christopher Judge an email

248
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,700
on Monday that says, per my last email? No.

249
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,380
Miltonius Games in chat says, this email should have been a meeting. Yes, that's why the Oscars

250
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,460
do a nominee's lunch, and that's when they talk about all that stuff. They buy them lunch at

251
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,380
least. So I think- They should have bought them lunch. Yeah, they should have bought them lunch.

252
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,940
Exactly. Come on. There's-

253
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,300
I would listen to people who give me free food.

254
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:40,100
That's right. There's my suggestion for the Game Awards 2023. I want to see a streaker,

255
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:47,060
and I want to see the nominees get bought lunch. All right. Okay, Loki, let's get into the weeds.

256
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,220
What were some of the other announcements of the Game Awards?

257
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,060
So anyways, again, I mentioned that there was a new Hellboy game based off the comics,

258
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:02,340
so Web of Word. And there's- Was it the announcement that Vampire Survivors is going

259
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,340
free on mobile, which is pretty cool. That was kind of a random surprise,

260
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,580
but I'm excited to see that. We got another look at Horizon

261
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,220
Call the Mountain, which looks pretty cool. I can't wait to check that out at some point.

262
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,580
Post Trauma, which kind of looks like Silent Hill.

263
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,940
I literally thought it was a Silent Hill thing, and I was like, didn't Konami already put their

264
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:30,900
cards on the table? Maybe that's the one that got rejected Silent Hill,

265
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,660
and so they decided to do something different with what they built. Sometimes that happens.

266
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,660
Well, not waste the assets. Not waste the time, yeah.

267
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:45,460
Viewfinder, which is a game that allows you to kind of alter the world with a camera.

268
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,020
And so it kind of- There's another one that's just-

269
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,340
I swear to God, I played a game like this at the Pop Culture Museum when I was in Seattle,

270
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,660
because you know they have an indie game room, right? And there was a game I played that was-

271
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,740
Sorry, I don't remember the name, but it was very much that same thing where it was like,

272
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,540
you look around in a picture, and then when you line it up the right way, it kind of turns into

273
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,580
something else. You turn it into a different thing. There's an indie game very similar to

274
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,220
this. And I honestly thought I was looking at a trailer for the indie game coming to PS5 or

275
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,860
something. Yeah, there's one like that where you can also grab objects and it changes size based

276
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:25,460
off of like perspective or something like that, which is kind of weird. Atomic Heart,

277
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:32,340
which looks pretty cool. It's kind of like almost like a Fallout or- I'm trying to think of the

278
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,620
other one that was like Fallout, but it's not. I can't remember it, but I did play it and I love

279
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:44,500
that game. But that looks pretty cool. There was Scars Above, which is like a sci-fi action shooter

280
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:52,580
game. Relic Hunters Legend, some online looter shooter. Among Us is getting a new hide and seek

281
00:23:52,580 --> 00:24:00,420
mode. That looked pretty fun. They had that, was it After Us, which is like some sort of

282
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:07,220
platformer environmental type game thing. Oh, that reminded me of one you skipped over during

283
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,860
the pre-show or you said it so fast I missed it. Yeah, yeah. Returnal on PC. That got me very

284
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:17,220
excited. Just saying. Haven't gotten there yet. Oh, my bad. I thought that was during the pre-show.

285
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,900
This is all still I think pre-show. Oh, shit. All right. My bad.

286
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:30,180
Yeah. So, Replaced, which was a sci-fi platformer. Then there's also, they had another

287
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:35,780
trailer for Street Fighter 6, which is they announced there's going to be a 2v2 mode and

288
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,860
I think it's also supposed to be coming out in June now. I think they did date it. Yeah,

289
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,980
it looks real good. I got to say, yeah, like there's something about those even numbered

290
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:51,460
Street Fighters. And then I think this is getting into the show now. I know Hades 2, I think was

291
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,420
the first game that they announced at the show, which looked fantastic. That was huge because

292
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:02,020
Supergiant Games, haven't they said they don't make sequels in the past? And here we go. I mean,

293
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,340
but if any game does, I mean, honestly, all of their games could stand to have a sequel.

294
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:13,780
But Hades like double so. And Shane is in chat on time saying Hades 2 was the only thing that

295
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,020
mattered. I would disagree with the only thing that mattered, but I would say it was a genuine

296
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,900
surprise. It didn't get leaked in advance. And it was one of those things that definitely led way,

297
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,780
especially the fact that it was at the beginning and was a surprise. It's just like the beginning

298
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:33,620
hour of the pre-show plus the first part of the show just felt like, damn, like they really are

299
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,820
coming out swinging this year. And then unfortunately we got to the last hour of the

300
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,660
show. It wasn't that it was bad, but it was all kinds of stuff they kind of told you we would see

301
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:47,300
like Final Fantasy 16 and that stuff. So, but anyway, Hades 2, I'm all about that. It looks

302
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,460
great. I like that they're kind of changing it up and making it about Hades. I think it's Hades

303
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:58,660
sister, right? But they'll still have, you know, the gorgeous gods and goddesses art, but it looks

304
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:04,740
like generally the gameplay will sort of be similar. So, yeah. Yeah. And then we have the

305
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:10,980
new Ken Levine game, uh, which looks like Bioshock, but is not Judas. It looks all

306
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,660
spacey and kind of crazy. And I'm all about that. It's very much a spiritual successor.

307
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,140
Sorry. Shane says it's Zagreus' sister, not Hades. I, I did that thing where I said the

308
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:26,580
main character. I said, I said, uh, uh, Zelda is the one you play as in Legend of Zelda. I

309
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,140
had a moment like that. Sorry. So, but yes, Zagreus' sister, so the main character sister

310
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,500
in the game. But yeah, Judas looks fantastic. Uh, then suddenly out of literally nowhere,

311
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,540
uh, Bayonetta Origins, uh, Sariza and the Lost Demon, which looks.

312
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:48,100
Okay. I have something to say about that. The Bayonetta spinoff game. So remember when all

313
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:54,340
the Helena Taylor stuff went down a couple months ago, I just want to point out at that time I said

314
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,900
Nintendo and Platinum are going to be pissed at her because she just told you they're working on a

315
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,540
Bayonetta spinoff game. Now, to be fair, this is not the spinoff game I imagined. I thought they

316
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,060
were doing it with maybe some of the other characters in the mainline series and so forth,

317
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,940
but Helena Taylor told you they were working on a Bayonetta spinoff game. Because remember when

318
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,620
she said with it, with me or anybody else doing Bayonetta or something that she, she was using

319
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:23,940
this language about, you know, what, what types of games they do, or if they spin Bayonetta off into

320
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:30,740
a series and all this stuff. Like, so Helena Taylor kind of spoiled this game, but not really

321
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,300
because who could have predicted it was basically a different genre of game and a different art

322
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,100
style. It's interesting that the Bayonetta franchise is now at a point where it is making,

323
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,020
which is a great thing, but it's making these different like spinoff game types. It's just,

324
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:51,140
it's interesting. Yeah. And we got a couple more new trailers for, uh, Destiny 2 Late Fall and then

325
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:57,620
Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League, um, which looks interesting. They confirmed with the latter

326
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:03,220
one that Kevin Conroy is going to be voicing Batman in that as well. It was his last performance.

327
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,860
Got a trailer for a Star Wars Jedi Survivor, which looks pretty cool.

328
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,580
Some of my friends that are really into Star Wars were like losing their minds. It did look really

329
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,060
like, you know, I'm, I'm, I appreciate Star Wars. I think that's a good word. I don't know if I would

330
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,820
say like I'm a hardcore fan, but I appreciate Star Wars. And I could see that like the,

331
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:29,140
the putting together that trailer, that whole moment with, uh, what, what's the actor's name,

332
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,260
Cameron Monaghan or whatever that came out with the lightsaber and everything. Like they just,

333
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:38,020
they put that whole moment together very well for those fans. Yeah. Um, and then we have a new game

334
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:44,020
by the creators of Celeste that called Earthblade, which looks pretty awesome, kind of a similar

335
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:51,860
style game as well. Um, another trailer for Duke or Duke Dune awakening, no Duke Nukem game for

336
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:58,020
a man, Duke Nukem awakening. It's surprised to see this in the middle of this show. I thought

337
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,860
this would be something that kept towards the end, but we got the announcement of Death Stranding 2,

338
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:12,260
which Kojima finally shit. Yay. Refer to last week's show if you need to, but, uh, yeah. Uh,

339
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,980
no, it was, it was not, you know, it was nice to see that all confirmed, especially,

340
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,100
uh, with the rumors about Overdoser going around as well. Like it's nice to see like what,

341
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:27,860
like what actresses are, you know, are in the Death Stranding 2, what that all kind of looks like.

342
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:33,220
Um, I mean, obviously it still didn't make any damn sense, but neither did the first one.

343
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,180
It made a lot more sense when she got in there and played it. So, you know, I'm,

344
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:41,620
I'm assuming the second one will be very similar. I'm just curious if the second game is going to

345
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,820
play like the first game or is he trying to make it more actiony this time? I don't, I don't know.

346
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,540
I don't know. So we'll kind of have to see. Uh, we got a trailer for Tekken 8,

347
00:29:51,540 --> 00:30:00,020
which looks like Tekken 8. Uh, yeah. Uh, Mortals of Avium, which, uh, is I guess a,

348
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,180
it's a game from Ascendant Studios who is comprised of people that worked on Call of

349
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:12,900
Duty and Dead Space. It's a first person magic based shooter game. So Hexen type of game, I

350
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:23,140
guess. Um, Nightingale, which looked, uh, kind of interesting. And, um, let's see Ballers Gate 3,

351
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:30,500
which was kind of surprising. Uh, Wayfinder, which was a online free to play action RPG game.

352
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,780
Uh, Diablo 4, I wasn't even paying attention to this trailer, but yeah,

353
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,020
we got a trailer for Diablo 4 and release date I think.

354
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:45,380
It looked, I mean, it's just a cinema cut scene. It had none, none of the actual gameplay was in

355
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:52,580
it. It was all just a hype for a release date, but, um, yeah, Diablo 4 looks really good. And

356
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,700
there's been, there was a press preview that happened this last week. And a lot of folks

357
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:01,780
are coming out saying, you know, it, uh, plays, um, like it has some of the best parts of two

358
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,380
and then some of the modernizations of three kind of all mishmashed together.

359
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,660
And some of the early, uh, impressions there are pretty favorable and, uh, you know, not,

360
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:16,500
not that, not that I, I mean, if, if I had played Diablo 4, I, I wouldn't be able to talk about it.

361
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,700
Um, but, uh, I, if I'd played Diablo 4, I bet my impressions would have been pretty favorable too,

362
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,100
but I guess we'll never know.

363
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:33,780
Um, horizon forbidden West burning shores. It's a DLC for horizon, uh, for Ben West

364
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:41,300
taking place in Los Angeles. So we get the Hollywood sign, uh, fire emblem engage.

365
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,260
It's a new fire emblem game. And I have as little interest in that as I do all the other fire emblem

366
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:53,940
games, um, blue protocol and action MMO. That's supposed to be coming out next year by Ben

367
00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:02,020
dynamic and Amazon games. So we'll see, um, transformers reactivate. It's a transformers game.

368
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,860
That was a wild trailer for a transformers game.

369
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,140
I honestly thought it might've been a Titan fall game when I, you know,

370
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,620
Oh, good call. Yeah. But then, then it was transfer. I was like, Oh,

371
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,140
Oh man, Titanfall three would have been a great announcement, but for whatever reason,

372
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,020
no, we got another, uh, another scene from the super Mario brothers movie. This is like

373
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,620
something that was comprised of stuff that was in some of the other international TV spots as well.

374
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:34,900
Plus there was some new footage to it as well. Um, but it's funny, I guess. I don't know. I still

375
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:40,420
want to see it. The footage was cute and, you know, it, it, it kind of sold to me the same

376
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:46,020
thing that that second trailer did. And that is that the, the movie was definitely animated and

377
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,580
directed by people that really understand and have a love for the Mario to universe.

378
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,620
Cause there's a lot of deep Nintendo and in general catch like a lot of stuff like they're

379
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,700
talking about, like the antiques or whatever it's like, is this thing still working? Well, yeah,

380
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:05,140
you got to blow it in a little bit. Oh, I didn't even catch that. That's funny, but yeah, no,

381
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,220
there's a lot of, there's a lot of deep, there's a lot of deep cuts, like just all over that.

382
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:14,020
And so, yeah, I just don't, I hope that's honestly, I hope that's the only clip we see

383
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,580
sometimes with these movies, they release so many clips online and they'll, they'll all be

384
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,580
over social media. And it's like, I will have seen half the movie cause of clips on social media.

385
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:28,180
And it's like, honestly, let it be a surprise at this point. I you've shown enough. I I've come

386
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:33,620
around. I've got, I, at the beginning I was like, eh, I'll watch it on video, but now I'm like,

387
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,020
all right, I'll go see it in the theater. I want to see it. It's cute.

388
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:44,020
Uh, we got a trailer for a game called remnant to, uh, remnant from the ashes sequel, I guess,

389
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:54,580
um, behemoth. It's a meta quest VR game. They can let you be a Viking. That's neat, I guess.

390
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:04,020
Um, banishers ghost of new Eden. I'm not really sure exactly what type of game it is,

391
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:10,820
but it looks cool. Kind of game of thrones ish. Uh, Warhammer 40 K space Marine too.

392
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:17,620
Uh, it looks pretty awesome. Uh, meet your maker was kind of a neat little thing. So it's a game

393
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:23,220
rebuild like outposts, I guess. And then, uh, other people raid your outposts and you have

394
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:32,740
to put traps and stuff in them. So that's kind of cool. Uh, it's not exactly home alone with

395
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,940
it's like, yeah, Warhammer meets home alone. That's what I'm just imagining now, Kevin,

396
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:47,060
with the tank, um, crash team rumble, which I know has made some people, especially in my

397
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:54,420
circle, um, very happy. So a new, uh, four V four, uh, game that's kind of out of nowhere there.

398
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:04,420
Um, Lords of the fallen is got another trailer and it does look pretty cool. The one that had

399
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:11,700
me surprised, and this may buy maybe my new love instead of saints row, but crime boss rock case

400
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:18,740
city. It is the game by the folks that put together the, uh, payday series. And it is

401
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:26,900
got a, like a really like triple a actor cast and stuff in it. And Danny Glover, Michael Madsen,

402
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,380
there was a lot of, uh, okay. But yeah, it can base here. Okay. But Loki, do you know what I

403
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:40,740
called that game? Grand theft boomer. Cause it is all like all it's a list actors and actresses,

404
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:47,700
but they are all over the age of 60, which is what I'm totally fine with. It's fine, but I'm sorry,

405
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:53,380
it's grant that boomers, but it's, it's, I mean, I, I, they're pretty good too. Like I've watched

406
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,340
gameplay of it and it looks fantastic. If you go to the orange lounge radio list of dream games,

407
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:03,540
I believe many hundred episodes ago, we put a dream game on there called grandma's got a gun

408
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:09,460
and you know what, Kim Basinger here's her moment. So grant that boomer it is. Um,

409
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,900
and Oh yeah. Shane does point out since when is vanilla ice and a list actor?

410
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:20,580
Well, there were other A-list actors in there and, and, and vanilla more Michael Rooker, but,

411
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:29,780
you know, it's fine. I, I'm, it does remind me of like a San Andreas or, you know, like one of the

412
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:36,340
earlier, uh, saints road games where they did have like big name Hollywood actors voicing the

413
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:42,100
characters in there. And, um, I'm all about that, especially since saints road just doesn't know

414
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:48,500
what it wants to be anymore. So bye-bye. Um, so there's an announcement of Call of Duty's raid

415
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:55,540
mode, uh, that's coming out, uh, cyberpunk new DLC. So cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty,

416
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:01,620
starring Idris Alda, which looks pretty fantastic. Another person who could read me the phone book.

417
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,980
I know. I'm glad they brought him in to get people interested in that game again.

418
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,580
I think there'll be a lot of people giving that game a second chance.

419
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,940
Um, armored course six.

420
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,980
That was a surprise.

421
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,980
I thought for sure this was good. Yeah. I didn't know that was an armor. Well,

422
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,820
I knew about halfway through the trailer as an armored core game, but I thought it would be

423
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:26,740
kind of cool, like an armored core dark souls type game. Like, you know, make it that kind

424
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:32,420
of hard, but armored core, but it sounds like it's going to be an dark or a armored court,

425
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:40,260
Elden ring type game. So either way, I felt like you were quaking. When I saw that trailer,

426
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,460
I was like, Loki is shaking and crying somewhere about this. It looked pretty awesome. I was like,

427
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:52,100
Oh yes. Yeah. Um, and then Final Fantasy 16 looks pretty cool. I still don't know what the hell's

428
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:57,860
going on in that, but it looks cool. I just don't like the combat though. Like I'm such an old

429
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:04,100
person, but like I really, the action combat stuff in there just turns me so off of these games. I,

430
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,500
I really miss the old Final Fantasy combat system, but I'll try it again.

431
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,540
I caught Odin in the new trailer and that made me happy. Cause I didn't,

432
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,060
didn't see that Odin was one of the, whatever they're calling him.

433
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,660
Espers summons, whatever they call them in this one.

434
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,220
Why do we have to change it every single time? Just keep the same names.

435
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:30,260
That's what they do. Um, so, and that was that, that was, that was kind of,

436
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:35,380
I gotta say though, that was a weird thing to put last. No, I mean, I get there's a ton of hype

437
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,980
around 16 and so forth, but it was just, it was a weird thing to put last because we already knew

438
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:44,500
it was coming. So I'm surprised, like you, I'm kind of surprised that and the Death Stranding

439
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,940
2 thing didn't flip, although let's be real. We all knew Death Stranding 2 was coming too,

440
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,220
but maybe the armored core thing honestly is strong enough to have been the last,

441
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,620
especially with Elden Ring winning game of the year, you know, another From Software

442
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:01,700
venture being the last announcement I think would have, would have been worthy of that. So.

443
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,820
For sure.

444
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,660
Yeah. So how are we feeling about the game awards overall? Like,

445
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,860
what would you want to see different next year? If anything.

446
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,060
Shorter.

447
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:18,740
How do we get there though? I wonder if we can get shorter at this point. I do feel like.

448
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,740
It's its own version of the daytime Emmys.

449
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,380
I that's in some regards, it's actually not a bad idea.

450
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,540
I think the reason the length is what it is is because they're using a lot of this as

451
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,180
advertising to pay for the whole thing in the first place as well. So like, I don't know if

452
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,660
you necessarily need to make it shorter and I'm fine with it being as long as it is. That's fine.

453
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:43,300
Cause if you don't want to watch it, you can just catch the highlights the following day. I mean,

454
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:49,540
or even just after it, I mean, it's not a big deal. Um, I think it's fine. I think it's fine

455
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:54,580
as it is. There are things that are unnecessary that feel like, like what the hell is animal

456
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:59,140
doing there? Like that doesn't make any goddamn sense. Like, I don't know what, what that was

457
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:04,020
about other than, okay, I want this to happen. Yeah. I think there's just a few things they

458
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:09,940
have to tighten up. I understand they gave away a lot of awards at rapid pace too, but, um, it's

459
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,140
fine. I actually kind of liked Jamie's idea though. Cause a lot of people were saying

460
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,580
you have enough to fill up two nights and I almost wonder if maybe some of those pre-show

461
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,980
announcements shouldn't go into some type of technical award show. That's a lunchtime show

462
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,540
that happens, you know, the day before or a couple of days before or something. I almost wonder if

463
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:35,940
there isn't enough here to have two, two award shows, but like one is obviously a little more

464
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,300
like, you know, the one you're pushing people towards than the other, but then at the same time

465
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,060
you don't want to cut away from the other. So maybe brand, I know people are saying winter

466
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:48,500
game Fest, but maybe just, you know, have, have the whole thing branded as game awards.

467
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,820
And maybe it could be like Wednesday is the technical game awards. Thursday is the public

468
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:59,140
ceremony game awards featuring game of the year. And, you know, have it be two ceremonies. I really

469
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:05,780
think there is enough to justify that at this point. So yeah. Yeah. Um, she hold 10 and chat

470
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:11,540
says show more winners and less trailers. You know, I think a lot of people hesitate to say

471
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:18,420
show less announcements, but I actually think it could stand to curate the announcements a

472
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:24,260
little more. I'm not sure if everything necessitated the time it was given. And I know that

473
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:29,780
sounds really terrible, but especially I'm going to give an example, a game that was already

474
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:36,500
announced last year. That's giving a gameplay update should really get minimal space. Um,

475
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:42,660
if that, if not relegated to a prior award show, I think they need to curate a little more what

476
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:49,940
they're putting into this. But at the same time, you need, you know, all those ad dollars, you

477
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,660
need to sell so many ad blocks. So you need things to fill that space. And if it wasn't announcements,

478
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,740
then we'd be bitching about lame comedy bits or musical performances. So I understand it's,

479
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,700
it's a very tricky navigational game that Jeff has to place. But despite all this, you know,

480
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,900
feedback, it sounds like I'm just complaining, complaining, and playing about it. Actually,

481
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:12,260
I again, I feel like this was one of the better shows. This show is on a good path. They just

482
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:17,300
need to fix security, fix some of these logistical things. And I think it's going to be in a great

483
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:24,580
spot next year. But I, but yeah, I mean, there's just, you know, a few things just glare out.

484
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,580
That's it. Yeah. And SGA 100 Matt says they actually did show less trailers this year. It,

485
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,260
it didn't feel like it. I'm just keeping it real. It didn't feel like it.

486
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:42,340
bonds 006 says the past year highlights on Wednesday and the actual award on Thursday.

487
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:49,860
Ooh, I like Miltonius game suggestion, a gamer's choice night. And then the critics night. That

488
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:54,980
might be a way to split some things up to you could do those esport related awards and, you

489
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,940
know, streamer of the year and some of that could be in the gamer's choice night. You know, some of

490
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,580
those things that I really like that idea. That's a good one. So I think, I think he should look at

491
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,740
splitting the show a little bit. Um, and I know, you know, again, people watch three days straight

492
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:13,460
of E3. They'll watch two game award announcement shows, you know, if they're, if it's done well.

493
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:23,300
So, all right. Any last thoughts before we move on? Has anybody preordered, bought or whatever,

494
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:31,380
anything as a result of the show? Nope. I will definitely, uh, put Hades two on early access.

495
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:37,140
That's for sure. So I can play that on steam and then I'm probably gonna pre-order or pre-purchase

496
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,860
because now that's the thing we do now is pre-purchase, but for Diablo four, I'll do it.

497
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:47,380
So I've just, that's always been my favorite Blizzard franchise and my faith in four is very

498
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:54,820
strong. So, uh, I, I, I will pre-purchase it. So, all right, let's move on and talk about

499
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,940
instead of things we plan to, Oh yes. Mike Deaf says I will get Street Fighter six on launch

500
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:06,740
though. I think I was already sold on six, but now I'm like really sold. So yeah. All right. Uh,

501
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,020
let's get into our gaming weeks. Not the things we're looking for, looking forward to,

502
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,740
but the things we've already played. Uh, Dar Sakura, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?

503
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:24,100
It was the same way it usually is for me. Um, I, uh, I beat Cult of the Lamb and I'm going to still

504
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:30,020
be playing it a little bit more just to see if I can do some completion on it. Um, I don't want

505
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:37,700
to spoil the ending, but I, uh, I made a special recruitment as my decision. Um, I of course played,

506
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:43,140
uh, lots of Dead by Daylight, some off stream. I actually played with one of my newer friends,

507
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:52,500
Raven McPherse. Um, we played for a long time last night. Um, and, uh, Oh yeah. Final Fantasy

508
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,980
five. I thought I had beaten the game and I had forgotten there's more game after the first, uh,

509
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:04,020
big X death battle. So oops, more game. Um, more deathing, more X-ing.

510
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,620
The title of my stream was who, who names their kid X death anyway.

511
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,300
That's a good question.

512
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:17,620
Yeah. Um, and I was doing some word scapes. I'm trying to think of something else that I

513
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:22,900
want to play, you know, just to kind of, you know, change things up. My schedule changes. Um,

514
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,140
probably the week before, I think it's the week before I go back to work.

515
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:34,020
No, the week after I go back to work, which is going to be the 20th. Um, so, uh,

516
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:42,100
that's next month, by the way. So, um, I'm, I'm actually my days off are all going to be together.

517
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,460
So I don't know what that's going to do for what games I'm playing or what I'm streaming, but, um,

518
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,580
but I mean, that's kind of been the vibe right now is just, you know, playing the familiar,

519
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:56,660
playing the fun, you know, cause that's all I play for is familiar and fun right now.

520
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,860
Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with some comfort food.

521
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,500
I'm just trying to think of those, something,

522
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,420
something a little bit new that I want to do. That's all.

523
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,700
Uh, Loki, we'll go to you. How was your gaming week?

524
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:14,900
Um, I just played Minecraft. Uh, so I was finishing up, uh, an episode of channel 64.

525
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:21,940
So I did that this week and then, um, this whole week I'm taking off to work on content.

526
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,620
Of course, it'll probably not end up happening, but I am, that's the plan is to work on content.

527
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:34,900
So, um, I have three different things going on at the same time as per usual. So I've got, uh,

528
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,940
the monsters mechanics series. I started, uh, like a live stream of, um, want to live stream more of

529
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,340
that, but I have an actual like episode coming up for that, that I'm doing a build. So I was

530
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:51,380
gathering materials for that. And then I started, um, a vault hunters, uh, or on a vault hunter

531
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:57,860
server with, uh, some friends from the nerd craft SMP. So, uh, they're playing over there right now.

532
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,740
And I got to check out vault hunters, one 18 a bit, which is fine. If you haven't played it, it's,

533
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:10,340
um, the quick overview is that basically it's a, uh, different type of gameplay where you

534
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,300
gather materials and you go run these vaults and it's all about collecting loot. And then

535
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,860
with the loot that you get, you can also, um, level up and then you start unlocking like

536
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:27,700
different mods and whatnot. So it's pretty awesome, but yeah. All right. That's about it.

537
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:33,780
That's it. Um, my gaming week, um, as I talked about last week, world of Warcraft, uh, Shane's

538
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,860
in chat and we've been playing a lot together. I've been playing on my own. Like I have a character

539
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:42,740
I'm leveling with him and then I have one I'm leveling on my own. Um, but Final Fantasy 14 did

540
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,660
announce something that has my interest. So I think when you hear me talk again next week,

541
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,260
you're going to hear a little more split time because there's a new boogal tome event. And

542
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:55,140
if there's anything I love in fall fantasy 14, it's more fucking cosmetics, uh, as a reward. So

543
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:00,100
I do want to, uh, go back and experience that a little bit. So I don't know. I don't know how long

544
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,820
I can juggle two MMOs, but I had a lot of fun, uh, streaming at the other night. We did a stream on

545
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:10,820
Friday, question mark night, I think. So, uh, it was fun. Um, other games I played this week,

546
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,900
uh, I think I did some debt by daylight. I believe I was on one of your streams,

547
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,740
Dark Sakura. We played cause I remember you, me and Gwen playing a little bit one night.

548
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,780
We did. And we were also joined by a Loco Poco.

549
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,180
Yeah. Who has to carry us all. Yes. He's so good at the game.

550
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:25,860
I know. Right.

551
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:30,420
And what a hero he'll die on hooks so we can get out. So yeah, he was, he was a good sport. So,

552
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:35,700
uh, yeah, that was, that was fun. I had fun doing that. Um, I definitely need to make sure I joined

553
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,860
at least once a week. So, Oh yeah. Finara brought up her double finger moment or excuse me, her

554
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,820
double middle finger moment. So that was great. And I clipped it, but, uh,

555
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,260
you got, I don't think I was in that match. No, I was. Cause I remember commenting.

556
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:53,060
It was the three of us. So Loco Poco wasn't there. And we had, wasn't it a pinhead,

557
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:59,060
sweaty pinhead that was like slugging and all this stuff. I don't know. Like the, it was just,

558
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:04,180
the pinhead was just a pain in the ass and, uh, the chain hunt was going on. So everybody was

559
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:09,300
slowed, but thank God when the hatch spawned, it spawned like right near where Finara was

560
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,900
and she was able to get out. And that felt like a really good way to stick it to that pinhead.

561
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,540
Right in the hill there. That was beautiful. Beautiful moment. Beautiful moment. And that

562
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:22,100
actually also felt extra good because Finara was usually the first one to die on hook. So I'm,

563
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:26,660
I'm glad she got to be the champion in that match and really stick it to that,

564
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:33,780
you know, pee hitty. So, all right. Um, let's see what else during my gaming week. Uh, there was

565
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:39,700
that Dead by Daylight. There was, um, Oh, I've played something new. I played soul survivors.

566
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,300
So I've been into the survivors genre lately because of vampire. And I kept saying,

567
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,180
I'm good. I think I'm going to check out the soul survivors game. I've seen other people

568
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:51,140
streaming and so forth. I did download it and check it out. And it's, it's fun. I, yeah, it's,

569
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,060
uh, it's pretty addictive. It's one of those things where I'm like, I'll just play one more

570
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:59,060
round. And it's like 20 minutes later, my round is finally ending because I'm getting better at

571
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:04,740
the video game and, uh, I'm beating more Titan bosses or whatever they're called. So it's good.

572
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:09,300
It's a survivors game, but it looks, it's more modern graphics. It uses the more 2.5 D kind

573
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:14,100
of graphics as opposed to vampire survivors kind of looks like ripped off Castlevania art. Like,

574
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,460
I hate to say it, but it, you know, that's what it looks like. It's part of its charm though.

575
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,700
And I think what drove a lot of people to it, uh, this one has a little more original art,

576
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,620
but it looks really nice. And, um, it's, it's a lot of fun to play. So good. Uh,

577
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,820
Infinoris' poop clicker 20 minutes of what the hell did I just play?

578
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:37,300
Seriously, it's a cookie clicker three. Um, so yeah, there's that. Uh, and then, uh, yesterday,

579
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:42,660
some friends and I went out to do Pikmin bloom because it was community day in Pikmin bloom.

580
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:48,020
Keep in mind though, yesterday it was storming here, especially in the morning. So we were like,

581
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,620
how the fuck are we going to do a Pikmin bloom day? Cause usually we'll walk downtown or a walk

582
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:56,500
around the college or, you know, somewhere to get 10,000 steps in. And usually there's a community

583
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:01,300
day for one of the other Niantic games as well, be it Pokemon go or Ingress. And there really wasn't

584
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:06,340
this time it was just Pikmin was doing its thing. Uh, Ingress was having an event in Japan,

585
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:11,620
but it didn't affect anything here. So, um, we were trying to find a place to walk.

586
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:16,260
We tried to go to the mall out in Roseville because we thought, Oh, it'll be empty because

587
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:22,660
of the storms. People are going to stay home. Ha ha. That place was a disaster. We couldn't

588
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:28,180
find a parking spot and we left. So we were like, fuck it. So we left, uh, we ended up walking.

589
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:34,420
Yeah. I guess the, the need for the holiday shopping superseded the storms and people

590
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,020
staying home. We should have, I was like, I thought malls were dying. I thought,

591
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:42,180
I thought everybody was bitching about people going to online buying now, but boy,

592
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:47,300
you wouldn't realize it over there. So there's a cute little old town, not far from there.

593
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:51,780
We just went with a ton of pokey stops and Pikmin stuff. So we walked up and down there because it

594
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:56,980
happened to be sunny for like a two hour break right around the time we were not sunny, but

595
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,860
clear. Uh, so we, we got our steps in. Thank you very much. And that was a lot of fun. So,

596
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:08,180
all right. That was pretty much my gaming week. All right. Uh, let's move on and get

597
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:13,620
into some more gaming news and we'll start off Loki with another big headline from the week.

598
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:22,420
Yep. Uh, so the federal trade commission has sued to prevent the Microsoft Activision

599
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:31,460
deal from going through. And, um, of course, I mean, it's a weird thing. Yeah, I get why,

600
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:38,180
but also at the same time, discovery Warner, um, HBO or whatever else. I mean, it's like,

601
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,260
okay, let's come after Microsoft, but let's not go after these other guys.

602
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,980
I get, I also get why, and this is the way I phrased it, uh, when I was talking about it on

603
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:56,100
Mastodon is that my desire for the big fish to stop eating the other big fish is superseded by

604
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:01,220
my desire to see the management at Activision Blizzard changed. Uh, and this is going to get

605
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:06,740
that done. So it's, this is the whole thing where it's like, I, I don't love the big companies buying

606
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,020
other big companies. And I understand people are sick of seeing that in this industry.

607
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:15,380
Activision Blizzard in particular is a problem in its current state and it needs to be fixed.

608
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:22,020
And therefore I'm like government, just let this one go. But I, I, I understand their concerns.

609
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,580
Right. Uh, basically saying, you know, Microsoft has shown that it can,

610
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:33,140
it can and will withhold content from its rivals. Uh, today we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining

611
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:37,620
control over leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition, multiple dynamic

612
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:43,620
and fast growing markets. I completely disagree with that considering that we've already seen

613
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:49,460
that there's still, um, they were complying with the agreements that were in place already

614
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,700
for Bethesda games on Sony's platform. Um,

615
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,580
Minecraft is one of the top selling games on the switch.

616
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:01,460
They have their games on all these different platforms. They've committed to putting those

617
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:08,420
games on other platforms. If anything, Sony does that. I mean, it's just, it's kind of weird to

618
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:14,900
hear that, but whatever. Um, but in response to that though, they have entered in a 10 year

619
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:21,220
commitment to bring call of duty to Nintendo following the merger and as well as, um,

620
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,900
putting it on steam, even though I think it already was on steam. Yeah, it is. Yeah.

621
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:29,380
It will still be on steam for the next 10 years.

622
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:34,820
Didn't Gavin come out and say, thanks, but we trust you. Like, he was like, you, you didn't

623
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:39,060
need to like sign an agreement. You've, you've, I thought it was because Gavin kind of came out

624
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:45,220
and said, gave new, uh, uh, head of valve came out and said, like, you guys, we didn't need a

625
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:50,100
contract. We didn't need a contract and you should be able to merge. So he's kind of supporting it.

626
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:56,260
Um, which is interesting because if you think about it, Xbox on the PC and a game pass in

627
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,900
particular is kind of a competitor to steam, but that hasn't stopped Microsoft from releasing their

628
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:07,300
games on steam. Right. And yeah, Brad Smith, the Microsoft president said also our acquisition will

629
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,740
bring quality to more gamers and platforms or whatever. And that's good for competition. Good

630
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:16,340
for customers. Um, also wrote a thank you tweet and at Nintendo, Hey, any day Sony wants to sit

631
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,620
down and talk, we'll be happy to hammer a 10 year deal for PlayStation as well.

632
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,060
What were you saying, Jamie?

633
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,140
Nothing.

634
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:30,260
Okay. Sorry. Um, now a lot of people are also joking about LOL call of duty on the switch.

635
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,980
Um, I think there's some stuff to read in there that it's sort of,

636
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:40,420
I mean, we all know it's coming, but this doesn't mean that, that if they're going to support call

637
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:44,980
of duty for 10 years, it's all going to be on the Nintendo switch. I think this just screams that

638
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:49,860
call of duty will be on a Nintendo successor. I know a lot of people are also talking about cloud

639
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:55,940
gaming and yes, the switch can handle the cloud and all that stuff. I feel like what we haven't

640
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:01,540
seen at least on Nintendo's platform yet, uh, in America. And that's a key distinction in America

641
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:08,580
is multiplayer cloud gaming on the switch. Everything that's been released resident evil

642
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,580
control. I've been like single player stuff. I'm not saying it can't handle it or that it

643
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:19,060
would function much differently. I'm just curious if the cloud stuff is popular enough in the U S I

644
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:24,180
would really want to see what the sales of control or those things have looked like, because I just

645
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:29,060
feel like, yes, cloud gaming is a way they could do it. That doesn't mean that's how they are going

646
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:35,380
to do it. I'm not convinced, especially until in Japan, this is a different story, but call of duty

647
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:40,820
isn't a Japan issue either like that. I mean, I'm sure there are some fans over there that import it

648
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:46,100
just as, you know, we import stuff from there and so forth, but it's just, it's, it's a non issue

649
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:51,140
for the Japanese audience. I just feel like the cloud thing isn't really proven as a big sell.

650
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:57,700
Like you're not going to sell call of duty in large numbers on a cloud switch game yet 10 years

651
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,500
down the line, I think cloud gaming is going to be a lot more integrated even by Nintendo. And the

652
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:08,180
story is different. But I think this just sort of confirms Nintendo has got to be working on beefier

653
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:12,580
hardware. But at the same time, if they got no man's sky running on the switch, then shit, they

654
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,540
can get call of duty running.

655
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:17,620
Well, yeah, but like, just because you're able to like really,

656
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,500
just because they can doesn't mean they should.

657
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:26,420
You can super optimize that game doesn't mean it's a testament that it will run anything like it

658
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:34,340
really won't. And yet to the actual quotes we had from like, Nintendo. So Nintendo commented

659
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:38,180
by saying that Nintendo confirms the accuracy of the Microsoft statement, we have nothing further

660
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:43,620
to announce on the topic. And then gave new all his statement was we're happy that Microsoft wants

661
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:49,300
to continue using steam to reach the customers with call D when their Activision acquisition closes.

662
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:54,100
Microsoft has been on steam for a long time, and we take that as a signal that they're happy with

663
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:59,460
the gamer reception and that we're what we're doing. Our job is to keep building valuable

664
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:04,260
features that for Microsoft and all steam customer partners. Microsoft offered even says a draft

665
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,940
agreement for the long term call of duty commitment, but it wasn't necessary for us because

666
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:13,380
a we're not believers in requiring any partner to have an agreement that locks them into shipping

667
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:21,140
games on steam, or for future was a distant projects or whatever. That's a dig at epic.

668
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:27,700
Uh, be Phil in the games team at Microsoft have always followed through on what they told us.

669
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:33,620
And we do trust their intentions. And see, we think that Microsoft has all of the motivation

670
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:40,180
they need to be on platforms and devices where Call of Duty or wants to be. So yeah, I think

671
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:45,220
they're right. Yeah, it's got to be on like, as many platforms as possible. Then yeah, sure,

672
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:50,260
like down the road, you know, they can start trying to get more people on their platform

673
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:55,940
using that as leverage. But I mean, it I don't think that hasn't really been their strategy

674
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:01,460
with like a lot of things like them, you know, so I don't see why they would continue doing that.

675
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:06,980
That's why like, you know, when I look at stuff like this, like, I really wish the government

676
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:12,100
would come after like other companies a little harder instead, like we have, you know, Microsoft

677
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:18,340
talking about merging and they're not like saying, Oh, hey, yeah, we made them create Call of Duty

678
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:21,540
for next year, but then we just scrapped it because we're going to write it off as a tax

679
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:25,540
write off thing, you know, oh, even though it was done and everything when you guys will just never

680
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:30,100
play it because it's tax write off. You know, that's the stuff that like Warner Discovery

681
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:37,860
things going on. Yeah, like can get her Jade, get them. Yeah, they're canning fully made movies

682
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:43,060
and stuff. So it just doesn't make any sense. Like go after them. That's the type of stuff you should

683
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:47,940
be going after. But I get it, you know, any acquisitions that further monopolizes the space

684
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:54,820
you know, industry is not good. But like, I think I'll pick the lesser of the two evils here and I

685
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,700
would have them go after discovery. Yeah.

686
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:03,940
So comments from chat a lot of you have your your your opinions in chat for sure. She helped

687
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:09,060
10 and chat says if Sony and the FTC block the deal, Sony will buy Activision a year later.

688
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:16,740
You know, of course, they would try. Absolutely. And I think that's that that would be so shitty,

689
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:20,020
because Sony is a bigger company in some ways than Microsoft, especially with the whole TV

690
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:25,780
and electronics. And you know, I mean, like, it's like, it's doesn't. It's wild. Let's see

691
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:30,500
other comments in chat. DJ Rama says can't be a monopoly when you only have four to 14% of the

692
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:38,020
market. I mean, facts like, again, Nintendo is a huge, huge player in this space. And it seems like

693
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:42,980
they're totally being ignored by Sony as weird is weird. Well, look at what Sony does with like the

694
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:48,180
Spider Man property talk about monopolistic and not letting their thing be on other platforms.

695
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:55,140
Like they hold that stuff hostage constantly. So I kettle black. The only thing is I'm I'm going

696
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:59,300
to be interested if it does. So yeah, as you want to match this Congress is stupid and doesn't know

697
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:07,460
the facts. I mean, t but I actually the one thing about this process that I do like is that hopefully

698
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,460
it leads to I don't think it's gonna lead to televised hearings. But it'll lead to hearings

699
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:15,700
that are on the public record. Maybe it could it could be on C span, I guess you never know. But

700
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:21,460
it'll be a hearings that are on the public record. And number one, we're gonna get so much NDA locked

701
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:26,900
good shit that's gonna come out in the the papers and all that stuff like like we've already been

702
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:31,140
getting like the PlayStation six thing from last week, right? Like it's all fucking coming out in

703
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:35,300
these like court documents and stuff. So we're gonna get some good gossip from all this stuff

704
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:41,460
that goes on the public record. So that that'll be fun in some ways. And two, I'm kind of looking

705
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:48,100
forward to the way the Microsoft lawyers are going to drag Sony right back. And I think there's a lot

706
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,740
of this that kind of maybe needs to come out on the public record. And again, I'm not I'm not

707
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:57,940
trying to be anti Sony or anything. I'm really not I love all the gaming companies equally. But

708
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:04,020
as I said in the beginning, this particular merger, Activision Blizzard needs to change.

709
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:10,100
And this is how it's going to change. And it's no different if Sony just buys them next year,

710
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:17,540
you know, it just delays this whole thing. So anyway, and also as Joe and her Matt with a good

711
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:22,820
point, the difference is that gaming doesn't have lobbyists funded by multi hundred million dollar

712
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:28,420
or millionaire funds like tobacco and so forth. And also points out FTC hearings aren't normally

713
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:32,500
public or TV congressional meetings are but I think Congress is going to be backed up with

714
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:39,140
other nonsense hearings starting next year. That house might be but not the Senate. Unless the

715
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:44,100
Senate takes up the January 6, he has lobbyists for sure they do. Oh, for sure they do. They do.

716
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:50,980
In fact, there's a whole lobbying. The ESA is the lobbying group. Look at all the good they've done.

717
01:02:53,060 --> 01:03:00,660
Yeah, yeah, that that and and to be fair to SSU 100. Matt, I too would sometimes forget that

718
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:08,660
there are lobbyists in the gaming industry. Dejirama S points out, you know, another like,

719
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:13,060
why aren't they looking at this type of issue? That Saudi Arabian media conglomerate, the one

720
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:19,540
that owns SNK Playmore? Why is that not being looked at? There's a like, you know, that's the

721
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:24,980
thing. If this is going to go to public hearings and stuff, then fine, let it but let's get all

722
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:32,180
the dirt out. Let's let's get it all out there. Let's get ugly. I want it to be the real housewives

723
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:39,460
of Silicon Valley. That's what I want those hearings to be. Prostitution whore. That's what

724
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:46,820
that's what I want Microsoft to do at those hearings. All right. Anyway, once the other

725
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:51,220
thing that Microsoft may have to answer to at those hearings, the fact that they're going to

726
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:55,380
be upping the cost of their first party games, but you know what, they weren't the first to do

727
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:00,500
it. So at this factor, I think they're pretty much the last of the big companies to do this.

728
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:06,740
But the inevitable has come much to Loki's delight, I'm sure that Microsoft's first party

729
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:12,820
games will be going up to $70. Starfield, Forza Motorsport, Red Fall will have the new pricing

730
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:18,020
there. This price increase, Microsoft said in a statement will reflect the content scale and

731
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:24,740
technical complexity of these titles. Also, Microsoft reiterating, you can still get these

732
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:30,980
through game pass $9.99 per month to start, you can guarantee the price of game pass is going to

733
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:37,940
go up to guarantee. So if you want to stockpile game pass, like before the new year, like again,

734
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:42,180
you're I don't want to tell you how to spend your money. And I can't predict the future. And I make

735
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:47,380
no guarantees. But let me put it this way, I personally will probably buy another year of game

736
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:52,900
pass and add it to my account. So I'm locked in for at least another year. Technically, you could

737
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:57,700
do it up to three, but that gets a little pricey for me. But at least for a year, I want to lock in

738
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:03,140
and be good there. I'll say what I said the last time we talked about the prices going up is that

739
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:09,700
I expect a $70 game, then it's $70 game is one that functions correctly and isn't followed by

740
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:15,300
a roadmap telling me how you're going to finish the game. That's, that's the way it works. Also,

741
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,420
I'm not going to create your games. So that's the other thing.

742
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:23,300
And what is the delay the game and bring out a finished item?

743
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:27,380
Sorry. Well, even when they delay the game, it's still bad. Like they did that with Saints row and

744
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:32,500
they delayed it and then it still was bad. Like it doesn't matter. Starfield has been delayed. So I

745
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:38,980
mean, I hope that means it is going to be a solid title. Again. I want to believe Phil Spencer,

746
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:43,380
I want to believe put it on my x files poster. I want to believe Phil Spencer gets it. I do.

747
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:48,660
Like, I feel like again, across all the gaming executives, I feel like he's the one that gets

748
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:55,060
the current like gamer mentality more than anybody. But the games have to speak for themselves,

749
01:05:55,060 --> 01:06:05,220
right. And he's not infallible either. So anyway. But as pointed out, Sony has already been doing

750
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:09,540
this. Ubisoft's been doing this take two has been doing this. God of War Ragnarok, Assassin's Creed,

751
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:16,100
Mirage, NBA 2k, they're all 70 bucks. Also should point out this also isn't it's not just going to

752
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:26,420
be for game for Xbox series. This is PC as well is now at the $70 price. You know, I'm just I'm

753
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:31,220
gonna I'm kind of feel I kind of echo the thing. I'm like, I understand a $10 price increase,

754
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:36,580
especially in the day of you know, with inflation, blah, blah, blah. When cartridges used to be more

755
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:42,580
if you know you want to say that and so forth. But again, yes, give me a game worth $70. If you

756
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:47,860
put out half baked games, you're just going to encourage your audience to wait for a sale less

757
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:52,900
and less people are going to be willing to buy day one, which is what you want industry because now

758
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:57,940
look at all the games. They're not all coming out just for the holiday anymore. I feel like especially

759
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:02,260
looking at the game awards. It's either the very beginning or the very end of the fiscal year is

760
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:05,540
when they're trying to get all the games out now actually more at the end of the fiscal year June

761
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:10,980
Hello, they're trying to get all the games out by the end of the fiscal year. So that but if you

762
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:16,100
release at the end of the fiscal year, then you're trying to make a big day one or week one splash.

763
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:23,620
Like Final Fantasy 16 is releasing June 22. Right? That leaves it like a week and a half

764
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,820
in the fiscal year to move a lot of copies.

765
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:32,340
No, here's just another thing to throw out there.

766
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:40,500
What's to say that some of the price hike is to get the soup, the super excited people and then

767
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:45,460
they put it on sale to lower it technically back down to a regular, regular price.

768
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,980
Oh, we're already selling Gotham Knights that happened with like it was like Gotham Knights

769
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:52,820
was out what like three weeks and then it was on a Black Friday or one of those sales.

770
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:58,020
Yeah, so but this way though they can keep manipulating the market too.

771
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,300
So it's just all a bunch of bullshit.

772
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:05,860
Miltonius Games in chat says more people will wait for sales and the sales will come because

773
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:11,860
so much of the money is made with microtransactions. They need people playing the games.

774
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:17,140
Quest Buster says one nice thing about getting a PlayStation five late finding cheap copies for

775
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:21,380
games like Returnal. That's true because when Returnal comes out on PC, which I am excited

776
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:24,340
about, it's probably going to run $70 which I'm less excited about.

777
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:30,660
Gigi Romas says I'm bothered by the $70 price tag only because I've gotten so used to cheaper

778
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:36,180
prices during the PS 123 Xbox 360 era. Secondly, I still think it's bunked that the prices are

779
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:40,020
going to be that high. Yes, I do understand that the tech and research costs have gone up,

780
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:43,940
but the production media is still cheap. But I've noticed lately most places aren't selling

781
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:49,060
CD and DVD spindles anymore. So yeah. Um, you know what, though?

782
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:57,060
There are a lot of games that are still going to be 2030 bucks. Hades 2, I bet is a $30 game tops

783
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:02,980
$29.99. It wasn't even that expensive. Yeah, I think the first one was only 20. So yeah,

784
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:08,740
I at maximum, that's going to be a $30 game and maybe another $20 game. Vampire Survivors

785
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:13,940
making waves $5 game. So thank God for the indie scene and smaller developers

786
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:21,380
to still be providing a perfectly acceptable quality of game market out there as an

787
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:27,940
alternative. So it's it's just it's going to be very interesting to see how many people buy into

788
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:33,380
the $70 price tag. But then again, I'm part of the problem, I guess because I'm looking at certain

789
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:39,140
games and I'm like, yep, I'll pay it. I want to play that game. I know I'm going to have a good

790
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:42,660
5060 hours with this game, maybe more. So I'll drop it.

791
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:51,460
Some folks in chat are talking about cartridges in that whole era. Sjo 100 Matt says it still

792
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:56,980
amazes me the games were 60 to $70 back in the 90s. Granted, consoles did cost less. Yeah,

793
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:00,500
that's because all the tech was in those cartridges. Remember how much the Neo Geo

794
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:05,700
cartridges cost? But that's because you were- How much they cost right up until the end of the

795
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:10,740
thing. Because you're literally getting an arcade board in those cartridges. I mean, it's the tech

796
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:15,780
is in the cartridge, the console is in the cartridge practically. So I mean, it really it

797
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:23,540
really is like the cheapest one I ever bought brand new was King of Fighters 2000. And it was

798
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:26,420
the only one I'd ever seen that came out for under 300 bucks.

799
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:33,220
digital mess as I remember seeing Phantasy Star IV and Virtua Racing going for almost $100. Yeah,

800
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:37,780
I think because those games in particular had a ton of RAM on them, right? Like didn't they have

801
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:42,660
like 64 megs of RAM, which for the time was huge. I might be mixing this up a little bit. But like

802
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:46,980
they just they had a ton of memory on those cartridges. So those games because Phantasy Star

803
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:52,500
IV, huge game, Virtua Racing, huge game to run those graphics and such, you know, that's why

804
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:56,340
those cartridges got really expensive was because you had to put more and more memory on them.

805
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:01,220
Shane in chat says I think Supergiant can get away with the cheaper prices,

806
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:06,500
because you know, they make a crap ton off merchandise. Good point. Their stuff constantly

807
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:11,380
sells out and they couldn't even run their own store at a certain point and had to hand it off

808
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:15,780
to another company. Well, when you you know, when you talk about merchandising, merchandising,

809
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:21,620
when you talk about that, I think of Minecraft. And you know what, Microsoft only charges 20 bucks

810
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:25,860
for Minecraft. But write in line with your comment. There's a whole fucking Minecraft

811
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:33,060
aisle at Target these days. You know, like Minecraft is is huge. Fortnite free. Also

812
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:40,500
merchandising and obviously a shit ton of microtransactions and so forth. Yeah, I'm trying to

813
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,900
think what else is like Stardew Valley, Stardew Valley have merchandise now at Target. I'm trying

814
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:49,780
to think what other video games I see with merchandise at Target. Oh, Five Nights at Freddy's.

815
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:51,460
Another example.

816
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:59,060
One. And we'll see. I don't have seen Piggy. I don't know what that is. But I think it's a game.

817
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:00,820
Oh, yeah, it's a Roblox game.

818
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:06,340
Oh, that's why. So yeah, no, yeah, merchandising. You make a lot of money off that too.

819
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:06,900
For sure.

820
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,500
Wait until our Neopets back.

821
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:16,660
All right. Moving on Dark Sakura. Also some other some other good change in the industry, right?

822
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:25,140
Yeah, so this one is a very positive thing. So a Microsoft owned company called ZeniMax Studios.

823
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:36,180
They actually have just recently the the devs have anyway, have unionized 300 of them,

824
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:41,940
about 300. It's the QA staff at ZeniMax, including developers across Bethesda.

825
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:46,900
Um, and studios that have worked on like Elder Scrolls Online,

826
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:58,180
unionized with the communications workers of America. And instead, like the the union drives

827
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:05,140
that have been going on with some other companies. Basically, we're like, we're we're sticking to it,

828
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:10,340
we're going to keep at it. They the quote is saying we applaud Microsoft for remaining neutral

829
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:14,500
through this process and letting workers decide for themselves, whether they want a union.

830
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:20,500
The company is fulfilling the commitments they laid out in their labor principles earlier this

831
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:24,420
year, while sending a resounding message to the video game industry, the right to freely and

832
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,660
fairly make a choice about union representation should be in the hands of the workers, not the

833
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:33,460
management. So basically, we're all these other big companies, you know, like I said, Microsoft,

834
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:41,060
Blizzard, not Microsoft, like Blizzard and a few other companies have wanted to arbitrate,

835
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:47,460
you know, step in, control how the narrative goes, Microsoft is like, this is you, this is all you.

836
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:58,180
They also organized the QA at Raven Software and Blizzard Albany.

837
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:06,260
But the the managers at ZeniMax have been given very clear guidance to remain neutral.

838
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:13,220
Over about the next four weeks, the QA staff will either sign their union cards or vote through an

839
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:18,660
electronic portal. And with majority support, the union will then be recognized by Microsoft

840
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:27,060
and become the largest in the gaming industry. So good for them. Good on them. And good on

841
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:33,300
Microsoft for that, too. Yeah, I'm appreciative that Microsoft sort of sees the writing on the

842
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:37,620
wall. I think where this and the industry again, another reason why I'm like, I think Phil Spencer

843
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:43,460
gets it more than a lot of folks in the industry and is is letting this go through basically and

844
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:50,580
just letting it happen because it will whether they want it to or not. I like the the statement

845
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:56,980
from the spokesperson at Microsoft. I'll just read it verbatim. The recent organizing efforts

846
01:14:56,980 --> 01:15:02,980
of ZeniMax employees and Microsoft is ZeniMax and ZeniMax's neutrality toward this is an example of

847
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:07,460
our labor principles in action. We remain committed to providing employees with an

848
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:11,860
opportunity to freely and fairly make choices about their workplace representation.

849
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,140
Oh, go ahead. Yeah, I'm just saying that that's pretty, pretty big.

850
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:22,260
SSJ100Matt in chat with a great comment. The industry is slowly getting unionized. It's a

851
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:26,020
great thing. Don't listen to the industry when they try to blame the unions for the higher game

852
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:31,220
prices. Good point because they will. Making sure workers are treated and paid fairly benefits the

853
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:35,780
people working on them and lastly, the games themselves. Great point by SSJ100Matt and quite

854
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:41,540
honestly, a call out to the gaming press and the press in general. When you're going to print these

855
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:46,100
CEO statements that are trying to blame the unions for the higher cost, you need to print what the

856
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:52,900
CEO made last year right in the same sentence. If you're going to print that sentence that the CEO

857
01:15:52,900 --> 01:16:00,020
blamed the salary, then the next sentence should be Bobby Kotick made X million dollars in stock

858
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:04,420
X million dollars in last year. Those two need to go together.

859
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,020
The other thing too is you also need to look at the corporate interests of the people

860
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:14,340
of the companies that are reporting this information and what they're looking like for

861
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:19,300
their union policies. Just saying. It's a big picture.

862
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:24,740
Well, sadly, just in time before the holidays with Hanukkah next week and Christmas in two weeks,

863
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:30,740
our industry's not being nice to some people.

864
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:40,820
It's like a yearly tradition. Hey, it's Christmas time. You're fired. So, IGN has laid off some

865
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:47,460
of their staff as well, just before the game awards, no doubt as well. This affected some of

866
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:56,980
their content engineering and ad sales, part of a large restructuring across Ziff Davis.

867
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:05,140
So, don't know exactly how many are impacted yet, but quite a few people have lost their

868
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:13,540
jobs from there. Then of course, to go along with that, to get all your holiday shopping done

869
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:21,140
at GameStop, well, they're also facing layoffs as well. Ironically though, it is coming in the form

870
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:28,900
of engineering staff as well. Well, right now, they also don't know what the impact of, or how

871
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:35,940
many staff were impacted, but it is at least six software engineering staff that have confirmed

872
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:43,300
that they've lost their jobs there, but it's mostly impacted the blockchain wallet development

873
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:49,700
I was going to say, I wonder if it's because that NFT market landed like a turd, like it just like

874
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:57,620
no one, NFT, no one fucking T cares. I don't, no one fucking touched it. Thank you. Yeah.

875
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:05,060
The NFT marketplace, like that's, that's, that's unfortunate, but, uh, you know,

876
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:09,780
cause obviously the people making that were just trying to do a good job, you know, and I don't

877
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:15,460
fault them, but you know, it just, it was a bad vision by the executive in the first place who

878
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:21,220
I'm going to guess was not laid off as a part of this, but probably should be. But unfortunately

879
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:27,460
that is how this industry works far too often. So yeah, anyway, no one fucking touched it. So I'm,

880
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:33,700
I'm yeah, I, I, yeah, not the retail workers at this point. I mean, I'm sure that they've

881
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:39,380
also done different things to reduce head count for whatnot, and they were still restructuring

882
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:44,980
what they said. Oh yeah. Now that we're emerging from our rebuilding phase of our transformation

883
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:50,020
GameStop has a strong foundation, blah, blah, blah, which to pursue profitability in the

884
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:56,180
near term, substantial growth and blah, blah, blah. Um, it's not wealth that trickles down.

885
01:18:56,180 --> 01:19:03,380
It's bullshit. Yeah. Well, it's, it's a sinking ship that they're trying to,

886
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:09,460
you know, shovel water out of. And the NFT was like trying to,

887
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:16,500
it was dumb, like trying to use a dime to stop, you know, a bucket size hole. So anyway,

888
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:20,660
like anyone could have told them that was, I mean, people did tell them that was a dumb idea,

889
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:26,980
but, um, they see dollar signs and it's different. Um, you know, going back to the

890
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:30,660
IGN thing a little bit though, I feel like, you know, media obviously in general has been

891
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:35,540
taken a hit, you know, obviously G4 and all that a couple months ago. Um, you know,

892
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:39,140
I was kind of thinking about like, why does media seem to really be taking a beating? And, you know,

893
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:43,460
when it was G4, I think we were just talking about, I think there was a lot of ways that,

894
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:47,220
again, management, it was mismanaged and I think mis-marketed. And I think they,

895
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:52,020
they spread themselves too thin with seven different preferences online. However, that

896
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:57,380
being said, I think there was just also a lot of, they had to compete with, you know, streamers,

897
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:04,180
YouTubers, and just other homemade content. And I think in the case of IGN, it's social media

898
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:11,940
and like, just honestly like accounts like Wario 64 on Twitter. Now I personally don't use Twitter

899
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:17,060
anymore, but I recognize the fact that accounts like, you know, Wario 64 and some of the other,

900
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:21,460
you know, gaming, what, Nebelion at a time. And there's just, you know, and other like,

901
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:24,340
God, it doesn't even have to be somebody that exclusively tweets about it. Just

902
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:31,940
when you have a curated list in general, wherever you're at, Mastodon, Instagram, TikTok,

903
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:35,300
you know, wherever social media you're at. I think a lot of people are kind of getting

904
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:41,060
their news as a part of that now. And if IGN doesn't have a smart strategy, like

905
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:47,860
IGN, if IGN's social media presence read like a Wario 64 feed, they probably would be in a

906
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:56,340
lot better shape. But it is what it is. Anyway. People.

907
01:20:56,340 --> 01:21:07,540
Yep. All right. Moving on. Let's tell this is wild. So it came up on last week's show,

908
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:13,540
or maybe two weeks ago, that Yuji Naka had been arrested. He was detained about insider stock

909
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:20,180
trading, basically, that he knew that there was a Dragon Quest spin off or something coming out.

910
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:24,740
And he had bought some, some shares around that, you know, you're not supposed to do that. That's

911
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:30,420
what Martha Stewart went to jail for. Although, many people could argue that, you know, she went

912
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:35,700
to jail to be a symbol and all this other stuff. But I digress. Insider trading was hypothetically

913
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:40,340
what she went to jail for. So Yuji Naka is now being accused of the same thing in Japan. So that

914
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:46,820
happened a couple weeks ago. And now it's being reported, he got arrested again, about the battle

915
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:50,900
royale game Final Fantasy seven, the first soldier, which didn't they pull the plug on

916
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:58,260
that actually. But yeah, they did. But again, he bought shares right before the 2021 announcement

917
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:02,740
of the game. Of course, you probably know the name Yuji Naka from Sonic the Hedgehog being

918
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:08,020
the creator of that. But then of course, he worked with Square Enix on Ballon Wonderland.

919
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:13,540
So one would imagine he probably did have some inside thoughts as to what was going on there.

920
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:18,180
Of course, that will all have to be proven in a court. And I admittedly do not know how that

921
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:23,380
works in a Japanese court versus the US court. So I will just have to rely on the news to keep

922
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:30,340
me updated on what's going on with that. But yep, in this latest report, apparently he bought shares

923
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:34,820
in a team entertainment just before it was announced that they were going to create Final

924
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:40,740
Fantasy seven, the first soldier, he paid 144 7 million yen, that's over a million US dollars,

925
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:46,500
just over a million US dollars for 120,000 shares. He was arrested alongside Tai Suke,

926
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:52,500
Sasaki, a Square Enix employee, who also was arrested over that same aiming issue in the last

927
01:22:52,500 --> 01:23:04,260
month. Interesting. So also to be noted, they released it mobile for, excuse me, they released

928
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:09,780
the game on mobile in November last year, and then less than a year later, it was shut down.

929
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:14,580
No word if he sold his shares before that happened. But I doubt it.

930
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:20,100
People don't pay attention. They think that they're going to be above it, that no one's

931
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,500
going to catch it when all this stuff is on the public record.

932
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:28,100
Yeah, it's just and it's it's hard for some people, I think to think with Yuji Naka,

933
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:31,940
you know, and again, this whole thing is alleged. So we can't say for sure. But

934
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:36,580
boy, fool me once shame on you and fool me twice. Right. But this whole thing is not get,

935
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:40,180
you know, it's like, Oh, he's the guy that we saw under the hedgehog. I love that game as a kid.

936
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:46,020
Well, some of our childhood heroes, it turns out are shitty people. It's unfortunate.

937
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:50,980
All right. I'm just like, what's the saying? Never meet your heroes.

938
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:57,380
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. Anyway, let's let's try to focus on some heroes that are

939
01:23:57,380 --> 01:24:01,700
hopefully less shitty in this next segment we like to do here at Orange Launch Radio every week.

940
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:18,020
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

941
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:22,980
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

942
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:28,980
And while I get the video up here, Dark Sakura, what did you pick for tonight's

943
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:37,060
classic game of the week? It shows Street Fighter x Mega Man or cross Mega Man,

944
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:41,860
however you prefer to say it. Um, yeah, we're we're doing another fan game.

945
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:52,980
No, I love it. And a crossover. So the game came out on December 17 2012. I know I'm a little bit

946
01:24:53,780 --> 01:25:01,860
within that 10 year period. But I think it's fine because we're we might be missing a week anyway.

947
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:13,540
So at any rate, the game was developed by a fan developer in Singapore named Sial Zong Hui,

948
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:19,140
I think I pronounced that right. And he did it as a labor of love, just a little, you know,

949
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:27,860
private development. And he sent an early build of it to Christian Zvenson, who is Capcom's senior

950
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:34,820
VP of consumer software at Evo 2012. And then he showed that and then he showed that build to

951
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:40,180
several staff members in the Capcom office. And Capcom's like, Hey, we're gonna help you out.

952
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:48,820
And he's like, cool. So he continued to develop the game based on his original design,

953
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:54,260
but Capcom took over the things like the funding, the marketing QA and decided to

954
01:25:55,540 --> 01:26:06,260
distribute the game on on PC so that the creator wouldn't have to deal with license for console

955
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:15,140
development. And Svenson said that Capcom could consider console releases in the future,

956
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:21,460
but just chose to release it on PC so it could go out at its target date.

957
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:31,380
There were some concepts that were scrapped in its creation. But let me rewind a little bit and

958
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:39,940
tell you what the game is. So the game, it plays like a Mega Man game. It has Mega Man or Rockman

959
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:46,740
right in the front. And you go through their levels the same way that, you know,

960
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:53,940
Mega Man always does. But your bosses are Street Fighter characters. You have characters like Ryu,

961
01:26:54,820 --> 01:27:08,420
you have Blanca, Chun-Li. I remember Rolento, Rose. What's the dude with the- I can't remember

962
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:12,820
his name now. No, not Dalsim. I know Dalsim is in there, but the dude from Street Fighter 3.

963
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:24,580
Oh well, I can't remember. Anyway, Crimson Viper is in there. But if you clear certain conditions,

964
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:32,340
you also can fight hidden bosses in the form of Sagat and Akuma slash Golgi at the end of the game.

965
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:34,340
It's not Urien, is it?

966
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:38,020
I don't remember.

967
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:46,420
Yeah, it's Urien. That's it. Yep. Okay. Anyway, back to the development on this.

968
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:54,180
Basically, there are other concepts that he had to scrap that Zangri did.

969
01:27:55,460 --> 01:28:00,500
Yang was supposed to be in there, but was replaced by Chun-Li. Although his special

970
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:07,460
weapon is still included via cheat codes and he wanted to put alternate costumes for characters

971
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:12,820
and a second playable character where it's one of the Street Fighter people, but that got scrapped.

972
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:18,660
There were several complaints about the game crashing after it was released and also about the

973
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:25,860
user interface and the lack of a save system. So in response, Vincent said that there was a patch

974
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:33,620
being discussed and then it was released on January 28, 2013 as Street Fighter X Mega Man

975
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:40,340
V2 and it had a better user interface, better controller compatibility, bug fixes,

976
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:48,420
and a password system that looks a lot like the Mega Man Mega Man 2 ones and an additional boss

977
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:56,340
character. The music was all done in chiptune by Luke Esquivel, also a underscore rival.

978
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:06,420
Esquivel became evolved when he actually reached out to the developer to request being a full-time

979
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:19,540
musician for the game. He compared his own stuff with the previous musician and so he was brought

980
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:26,740
on. He combined Mega Man themes and Street Fighter themes for certain songs and he used elements like,

981
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:39,460
for example, Ryu's theme mixes with Crash Man's music. So it's pretty cool the way the two marry.

982
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:46,820
And then there's some completely original ones like the Wily map theme and the beginning of the

983
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:56,260
end theme and the soundtrack was considered so popular that the soundtrack got released. I love

984
01:29:56,260 --> 01:30:08,340
it. There was an EP with four tracks that is called Street Fighter X Mega Man extended volume

985
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:19,860
one on February 8, 2013. It had four extra ones. It also had a remix of Ryu's theme,

986
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:25,940
Young's theme that was unused, Voice Collection and Sagat's theme. One of the things I have to point

987
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:37,860
out is how clever they mimic speech. If you go and listen to Ryu, even though it's not actually

988
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:47,780
synthesized speech, it sounds like he's calling out his attacks. I would say more based on the

989
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:55,620
Street Fighter II version of them just by mimicking intonation and tone from when he says

990
01:30:55,620 --> 01:31:06,420
it. I think it's quite clever. But the game actually really did exceed expectations. They

991
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:15,540
haven't released any official real numbers for that first week but again they're like,

992
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:22,900
damn, this was enough that it caused strain on their servers. This was noted by Capcom

993
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:30,820
Senior Community Manager Brett Elston. And by March 3, 2013, the game had been downloaded

994
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:43,860
one million times. It got mostly positive reviews. The initial game had some very mixed reviews but

995
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:53,620
clearly they listened to people. They put out that better one. There were some people who were

996
01:31:53,620 --> 01:32:00,420
just way too critical. At Edge, they gave it a 5 out of 10 noting inconsistent level design and

997
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:05,700
limited functionality is its biggest flaw. But I don't know. It plays like a Mega Man game.

998
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:13,940
I mean, it's not perfect but it's a really enjoyable game. The soundtrack is really part

999
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:25,460
of what makes it shine so I'm really glad that the developer went with A-Rival. It's just a great

1000
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:33,060
game. It's absolutely worth bringing up. I have parts of the soundtrack on my permanent rotation

1001
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:40,820
on my video game music soundtrack. There it is. Classic game of the week. Street Fighter

1002
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:50,820
across Mega Man. For a side project, again, very impressive because this really wasn't an official

1003
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:56,420
Mega Man game but it's kind of embraced. But it was enough that Capcom didn't notice.

1004
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:03,620
It's dang impressive. I like that pick because I like this game and I like these types of

1005
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:11,940
fun little side projects. It's the little fan game that could. It became a real game.

1006
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:17,540
It did. It sure did. It didn't even need a Blue Fairy. It just needed Capcom.

1007
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:25,940
But I agree. The soundtrack is a real highlight of the whole game. I can see some of the minus points

1008
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:29,620
on the level design and so forth. You could even see it in those two stages.

1009
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:37,220
At the end of the day, as far as what it is, what it brings to the table,

1010
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:41,060
just the fact that they designed it all that way, it still deserves massive kudos. The game

1011
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:48,500
had probably zero budget so it's amazing. I think it was cool that Capcom handled the

1012
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:53,860
rest of the side of it. They did actually give some funds for development.

1013
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,820
I'm glad they didn't pull a Nintendo and C&D it.

1014
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:03,060
This is the thing that Nintendo needs to pay attention to. Look how lucrative

1015
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:12,820
something like this could be. What if they had put it out for Steam for, say, two bucks?

1016
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:24,180
Right? Imagine two bucks a million times. Just saying. It may be chump change, but it's change.

1017
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:27,300
Matters to somebody.

1018
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:33,620
All right. Well, thank you for that pick. Let's move on and cover some other video

1019
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:38,420
game news around the industry in rapid fire news. We will start with Loki.

1020
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:48,980
So the latest episode of The Simpsons brought in a nice cameo from Roblox or in this one,

1021
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:57,140
it's Bo blocks, obviously. The whole premise of the story there is that apparently Bart was

1022
01:34:57,140 --> 01:35:04,500
playing like an Assassin's Creed VR type game. And because it's too violent, March made him play

1023
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:09,780
a more kid friendly game. And that's where they got into Bo blocks. And then he finds out that

1024
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:15,300
he can do some of the cosmetic items and sell them for real world cash because their computer is so

1025
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:22,580
old. So it ends up this whole racketeering thing with Skinner and everything, trying to earn money

1026
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:27,460
to, you know, fix up the school and stuff. And then there's like gang rivalries, other school

1027
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:32,740
gang rivalries and stuff like that. So it sounds hilarious. It looks funny. I'll have to check it

1028
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:43,540
out. But yeah, funny to see blocks and a Simpsons episode. And then I've still amazed that The

1029
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:50,660
Simpsons is still on TV making fun of current pop culture. It's pretty wild. It is. And then

1030
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:57,220
Halo Infinite is getting a cool update this month with a custom game browser. So all those things

1031
01:35:57,220 --> 01:36:03,940
in Forge now, you can check out and play them, which is pretty cool. And there's been some really

1032
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:11,300
neat creations, everything from Andy's bedroom to I think I saw Princesses Peach or Princess

1033
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:16,100
Peaches castle and they have like different game ideas like paintball and stuff like that. So

1034
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:23,700
yeah, pretty cool. Worth checking out if you have a Halo Infinite or game pass to grab it or that.

1035
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:25,940
Yes. All right, Dar Sakura.

1036
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:31,940
You got the mute on Discord.

1037
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:41,380
There we go. So for anyone who is a fan of the classic series ToeJam and Earl,

1038
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:49,220
there is a movie in the works at Amazon Studios. Especially since there was the crowdfunded

1039
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:55,220
game released just not too terribly long ago. But it's being produced by Unanimous Media,

1040
01:36:55,220 --> 01:37:01,620
the studio that was found by Stephen Curry, screenplay by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo,

1041
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:09,380
both who worked on Hotel Transylvania and on Disney's upcoming Superfudge series.

1042
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:13,380
I want to say I should have known about that. I love those books.

1043
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:22,660
But also it's co-produced by Story Kitchen. So there's people with big names involved in this

1044
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:30,020
one. But it doesn't say really a whole lot about it. So hopefully it'll go by the original game,

1045
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:35,620
you know, just that they get marooned on earth and they have to put their ship back together

1046
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:42,020
and leave. But I hope they keep the satirical nature of the game. So this would be

1047
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:47,300
hopefully this will be good. You caught the attention of several people in chat with the

1048
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:52,900
whole Superfudge reference, Tales of Fourth Grade Nothing, that whole thing. But apparently,

1049
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:57,780
I did not know they were doing that again. Didn't they do a series in the movie or something?

1050
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:01,620
And then a long time ago. It's been a while ago. Yeah, I can't remember either.

1051
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:06,020
But I kind of would like something focused on Margaret.

1052
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:10,260
Oh, a timely update for that.

1053
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:15,940
I have I've read Are You There, God It's Me, Margaret, like when I was really little.

1054
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:21,300
And because I mean, these books were written in the late 70s, I think.

1055
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:22,180
Yeah, late 70s.

1056
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:30,260
I would love to have an updated story for Margaret if they're going to try to update,

1057
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:36,980
you know, Farley Drexel Thatcher, good old Julie, how I remember his name, for real.

1058
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:38,820
And the baby's name Tootsie.

1059
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:43,700
The one this is not the same author. But when I think of childhood books that were huge,

1060
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:47,540
like around that age, when I were reading those books, like fourth grade stuff.

1061
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:52,980
Thank you. Did you remember it says there was a Superfudge TV series in the 90s ABC Saturday

1062
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:58,500
mornings? Really? I didn't know that anyway. Um, but I think of the Ramona books.

1063
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:05,700
And they yeah, PBS did do see because that author died relatively recently,

1064
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:08,740
like a couple years ago, and she was like 99 or so she was, you know, up there.

1065
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:12,180
Encyclopedia Brown. Oh, my God.

1066
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:19,380
Okay, I know that they made a movie for it, and I have yet to see it. But one of my favorite books

1067
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:26,180
as a kid was from the mixed up files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.

1068
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:28,020
Oh, yeah, they they did a TV. Yeah.

1069
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:32,340
Yeah, I loved that book. I've read that book so many times. Like,

1070
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:34,660
I used to have dreams of just moving into a museum.

1071
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:42,260
Um, the other the other one would be the roll doll. But even though I, I believe wasn't wasn't

1072
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:47,540
he kind of issue it but but I remember still reading like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

1073
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:51,700
and I read the glass elevator, which elevator was an interesting story.

1074
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:56,340
Did they ever make that they weren't going to and he his he denied it.

1075
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:02,660
Because he was he was displeased with how the movie turned out.

1076
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:07,780
Yeah. Phil of nine and chat says doll was canceled. All right. But But you know what,

1077
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:13,380
I was like 10 when I read those books. So but James the giant peach was a huge one. I remember

1078
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:18,900
Disney did a thing on that. So yeah, so. Wow. Dr. Seuss's Beverly clearly was 104

1079
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:22,900
when she passed get out. I thought she was like late 90s. I mean, I know she had a nice long run,

1080
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:27,940
but that's incredible. All right. Anyway, sorry. rapid fire news is turning into book chat

1081
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:33,780
with the orange lounge bookie. Oh, anyway. And but here's the thing. Judy Blume is still

1082
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:39,860
alive and still writing. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yep. As she says they did a remake of the witches

1083
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:44,980
a few years ago. Yeah, apparently it did not. It kind of landed thud. I guess people didn't

1084
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:48,980
want to see that one remade because it was very creepy. Didn't and it creepier. Yeah,

1085
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:52,580
didn't Anne Hathaway put well, it was also true to the book, the grand high witch,

1086
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:57,300
if I'm not mistaken, which was she played the grand high witch. Because you know, they

1087
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:01,060
wait, of course, you know, but just for the audience, they completely changed the 80s,

1088
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:06,820
which is the ending is completely different. But I believe the new one had the original

1089
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:14,500
that the first movie had a happy ending. Yeah. Anyway, we thought that him staying as a mouse

1090
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:20,580
was a happy ending. Oh, let's let's talk about some games that were out around that age. We

1091
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:27,780
were reading all those books. And thanks to arcade archives. We got another game on the switch that

1092
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:32,740
I'm sure is on its way to PlayStation as well. It's Pac mania was the game for this week. It

1093
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:40,500
released on December 8 2022. This of course was Pac Man going 3d although it was more like 2.5 d

1094
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:46,020
but that's what 3d was back in that era. And of course that infamous jump button that made the

1095
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:52,340
game a lot easier. So you probably always got a little further in Pac mania than you did the other

1096
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:58,580
games but yep, that is on the switch e shop and I'm pretty sure it's got to be on the PlayStation

1097
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:05,300
four as well as those hamster arcade archive releases tend to be. Alright, let's travel

1098
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:10,020
around the world and check out some games that will be out this week. Although I imagine it's

1099
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:16,340
got to be slowing down. No, no, says Logie. No, there's not much. Oh, not much. Okay.

1100
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:22,420
No, this week, though, we do have some big stuff. So we have crisis core Final Fantasy seven reunion

1101
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:27,380
on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

1102
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:34,980
High on life on PC, Xbox one and Xbox series. The Witcher three wild hunt on PlayStation five

1103
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:47,060
and Xbox series. Looks like aka or aka on PC and it's in the switch. We have Akai katana shin on

1104
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:53,700
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one Azure Striker gun volt three on PlayStation four

1105
01:42:53,700 --> 01:43:03,060
and PlayStation five black tail on PC, PlayStation five and Xbox series. River City girls two on PC,

1106
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:09,460
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. And last but

1107
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:16,420
not least, Megaton Musashi X on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

1108
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:20,980
Well, going to Japan and looking at the releases there. Yeah,

1109
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:25,540
this crisis core Final Fantasy seven reunion appears to be worldwide. So it's on Japan's list

1110
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:30,900
too. And that I did not realize that was still on deck for this year. That's a pretty big deal. So

1111
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:36,420
that is coming out in the 13th. On the normal release day in Japan, the 15th we have some

1112
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:42,180
other games for Nintendo Switch, including Akai katana sheen comes out them's fighting herds gets

1113
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:48,500
its Japanese release on December the 15th. The cosmic fantasy collection is also out in Japan

1114
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:58,580
on that day. And we also have WRC generations. Tetsudo Nippon real pro Tokyo Soko comes out as

1115
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:02,900
well. And because we have to have a SpongeBob SquarePants game even in Japan the battle for

1116
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:09,860
Bikini Bottom rehydrated not remastered rehydrated is out in Japan on the switch this week as well.

1117
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:18,100
Also, if we go over to the PlayStation five, just that same crisis core rerelease

1118
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:23,460
is out on the PlayStation five as well. Otherwise, nothing specific on the 15th.

1119
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:32,020
How about Europe dark soccer? I have a literal handful on the 13th for PlayStation Xbox and

1120
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:38,180
switch we have crisis core Final Fantasy seven reunion. And then Hello Neighbor on Xbox Hello

1121
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:44,660
Neighbor two. That that that's all that's on the list. All right. All right. We have a few more

1122
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:48,260
stories for you. And then we're going to be inviting you all to participate with our show

1123
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:52,580
if you want to ask some comments in our chat, although you might want to hold off on any

1124
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:56,420
questions till we get to that segment. But if you want to give us a call, you sure can. All you got

1125
01:44:56,420 --> 01:45:02,260
to do is have head over to our green room over at vog network.com slash discord. And I would

1126
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:07,060
encourage you to join the discord server and, you know, discuss things throughout the week with us.

1127
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:11,860
You know, a few stories in tonight's show roll were saved, or excuse me, were noted for the

1128
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:17,460
show roll, because you posted them in discord, like the $70 game price, Microsoft, somebody had

1129
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:22,260
posted about that earlier in discord. And I think we have one coming up to that also is from discord.

1130
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:28,260
So yeah, we love to read and chat along with you all there. So I know everybody's trying to get

1131
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:32,980
you to join their discord server. But I promise, it's a lot of fun over vog network.com. We don't

1132
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:39,220
spam with the everyone in the here. So please, please head on over. All right. Loki, what do you

1133
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:48,260
have for us? Yeah, so there's this really cool mod that's been worked on by this guy. Janae Gosar,

1134
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:56,020
he's a developer in Slovenia. And it's basically a mod that takes the cities that you've created

1135
01:45:56,020 --> 01:46:03,300
in SimCity 2000, and ports them over to Minecraft. So these said, basically, the reason

1136
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:09,060
why he made it was because there have been other mods out there, they've put in the terrain from

1137
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:15,060
SimCity 2000 and import into Minecraft, but nothing with the buildings. So he went ahead

1138
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:21,700
and coded it himself. And so it actually uses the SCG format from SimCity 2000. And you can then

1139
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:26,420
pop it into Minecraft, it looks like he made it for a pretty old version of Minecraft, because

1140
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:34,660
looking at the one he's flying around in is, it looks pretty old. But it does mean it does create

1141
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:40,980
structures, at least in the areas where you would have had those buildings. And so you can even kind

1142
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:46,820
of walk around some of them as well. There's like some basic interiors on some of them. But yeah,

1143
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:52,500
it's pretty cool. A very narrow use case for that, but still neat.

1144
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:58,180
So I was finally pulling this up, so I could see this myself. But yeah, probably has a very

1145
01:46:58,180 --> 01:47:02,420
limited use case. But it's one of those like, neat. So it's actually loading into save files

1146
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:05,700
from SimCity 2000 and converting into Minecraft, because that's pretty cool.

1147
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:12,660
I think what it does is it takes the save file from SimCity and converts it into a Minecraft

1148
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:16,260
map. Yeah, as you can see, like looking at the textures and everything here, I mean,

1149
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:21,220
we probably like with some tweaking, you could probably make it look even better.

1150
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:25,140
Yeah, with the block palettes now, because I think, like I said, the version that he's running here

1151
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:29,220
just based off of the glass textures and stuff. Yeah, and the draw distance is much better now.

1152
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:35,060
Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is like this is very old. Like you could make this look way better now. But

1153
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:39,140
that's still neat, though. It's fine. It's still it's in the quite an accomplishment.

1154
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:43,780
Yeah, for sure. I mean, just that whole concept of like taking a save file in one game and using

1155
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:48,340
it in another like I love that. Like it reminds me of how like what was it your Mass Effect

1156
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:51,060
save file could be read by Frog Fractions too. Remember that?

1157
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:53,700
What? Why?

1158
01:47:53,700 --> 01:48:00,500
I don't I don't it was part of the what? It was Frog Fractions, Loki. Why is the overarching

1159
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:02,020
question? You know, that's

1160
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:04,420
But for what purpose did it do that? Like

1161
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:09,460
it was part it read something in this save file and affected the Frog Fractions story

1162
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:12,660
because that's what happens in Mass Effect. But also

1163
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:17,860
found that article from December 27 2016. Oh, really?

1164
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:21,780
Yeah, Frog Fractions 2. Right.

1165
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:32,340
And they said that it wanted to import data from Mass Effect 2 save files into Frog Fractions 2.

1166
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:40,340
Upon doing so a second screen pops up. Well, welcoming Commander Shepard. And they

1167
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:48,420
just it doesn't actually do anything. But it it welcomes you as Commander Shepard.

1168
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:54,260
Okay. Then that's more akin to Psycho Mantis reading your save card and seeing Oh,

1169
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:57,540
I see you like Castlevania. That type of thing.

1170
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:07,940
Or when Cloud is all crazy and he says Xenogears when Xenogears was coming out, but

1171
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:12,820
it was all spelled phonetically. As J-100 Matt making a good old

1172
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:17,460
SimCity action news report saying the sun has gone down and creepers are storming downtown if

1173
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:26,020
you hear hissing run. If you again if if you don't understand the SimCity and anytime this

1174
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:31,460
fucking game comes up, we always reference the classic CD-ROM that had the action news and they

1175
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:39,620
were very poorly public access channel level acted bits that would announce when monsters

1176
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:43,620
were invading and all this it was just to show off the video on CD-ROM otherwise it was it was

1177
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:50,420
just fucking SimCity. But it was it was so bad it was good. Anyway. But these these games and

1178
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:53,140
these apps have come a long way haven't they Dark Sakura?

1179
01:49:53,140 --> 01:50:06,260
And in fact, here's another development. There's an app called Calm, which is like a mindfulness

1180
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:18,420
app. And there it's going to have if you have a calm premium membership, you can actually have

1181
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:27,700
the ocean of Sea of Thieves or the ambient noise of Zeta Halo from Halo Infinite playing in the

1182
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:34,420
background while you're meditating and being all chill. If you aren't a member, you'll be able to

1183
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:39,780
access that service for three months with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. And then after that, if you

1184
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:47,380
want to keep using calm premium, you get a 50% off discount for the first year. Normally, the full

1185
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:56,660
year is like 70 bucks. So they say that they Xbox teamed up with calm to support players mental

1186
01:50:56,660 --> 01:51:03,060
health and well being. It has a collection of Game Pass titles to address mental health as well.

1187
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:10,580
For you know, to give a sense of escapism like Persona five Royal Hellblade Sanua sacrifice

1188
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:17,700
unpacking and Stardew Valley. Fill a nine in chat asking a good question here saying do other

1189
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:23,700
people use video game music for meditation and relaxation? I listened to Wow, and Minecraft a

1190
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:31,220
lot to chill and relax. Minecraft music is super relaxing. Yeah. It's just it's interesting to me

1191
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:36,580
to hear Halo alongside calm. I get that it's like ambient spaceship noises, basically. But

1192
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:43,220
I just think of like, Xbox Live back in the day during Halo three, and I think stressed. That's

1193
01:51:44,020 --> 01:51:49,460
the other app. So anyway, yeah, deezerama SS persona five Royal should not be a game listed

1194
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:54,180
for mental health. But it's it's it's not the game. It's the ambient noises and the

1195
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:58,900
the sound effects and that whole thing. Oh, this one actually is a game that's listed

1196
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:05,860
as to help. Oh, is it escapism or something? Oh, interesting. Well, aren't a lot of video

1197
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:16,180
games escapism at the end of the day, I guess. Interesting. All right. Well, moving on. Let's go

1198
01:52:16,180 --> 01:52:22,580
back over to Loki. Yes, it's another week of what did Nintendo cancel this time? Or I should say

1199
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:27,620
what did Nintendo cancel that someone else was working on this time. And today's episode is going

1200
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:36,660
to be followed by or it is actually I believe did you knows gaming. It was the heroes of Hyrule was

1201
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:45,460
a video they were doing about a DS game called heroes of Hyrule, which was a tactic. But Nintendo

1202
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:52,260
has struck down because Nintendo being Nintendo. It was it was a pretty good video was a long one.

1203
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:59,940
And they even put out like a bounty for, for something about it. But um, but yeah, they did

1204
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:04,820
a really in depth episode. It was a really good one. I'm glad I got to see it before it was taken

1205
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:13,540
down. Yeah, so of course, you know, you know, this is the heroes of Hyrule video was created

1206
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:18,100
using the same process and video editing style for most of the videos on the channel. What sets

1207
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:23,220
the video apart is that one of the few videos on the channel that documents piece of Nintendo

1208
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:31,940
history that was first uncovered and reported on by us. But yeah, so that's unfortunate. It says

1209
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:37,860
we've heard from several sources during the videos production that Nintendo was were becoming upset

1210
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:43,540
with the amount of former Nintendo employees that were willing to talk about and share material from

1211
01:53:43,540 --> 01:53:48,260
unreleased games, failed pitches and other canceled projects. This did not deter us and

1212
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:53,220
will not deter us from documenting video game history. As it should, as it shouldn't.

1213
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:59,380
They do amazing stuff. And I interesting I did not know it was obvious I didn't see the video

1214
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:04,180
but dark soccer kind of you bring up that bounty and I wonder if there's something about that,

1215
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:11,060
that Nintendo really didn't like. I don't know. It's interesting. I don't know. I don't know. I

1216
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:20,820
mean, it was, there was a lot more in the video. They really did have a lot of, a lot of former

1217
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:27,140
employees talking as well, different, different like drawings and some different things that were

1218
01:54:27,140 --> 01:54:33,300
submitted. And, you know, the few screenshots, you know, there was about, they did a lot of digging

1219
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:39,780
because this had been really buried. Yeah. Yeah. It had been pretty damn buried. Let me ask a silly

1220
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:43,620
question, but I'm sure it's something someone on the internet saying this somewhere. Do you think

1221
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:49,940
Nintendo pulls something like this? Cause they're planning on bringing it back? No. Or was this so

1222
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:53,940
far gone? I think they're just, I think they're just doing this because it's, it's showing

1223
01:54:54,980 --> 01:55:01,060
Zelda stuff. And so they're like, no, that's so weird. They could, they could benefit from some

1224
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:05,620
of that. Yeah. It's a part of video game history, you know, and I can't see in chats as Nintendo

1225
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:10,260
preservation. What's that? Yeah. It's, it's so wild. It's a copyright strike.

1226
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:14,500
It's just like the old, um, remember the old copies of Nintendo power that were in the

1227
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:19,140
archive or whatever those got struck down too. So it's, it's, yeah. Cause that was really hurting

1228
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:26,500
the bottom line. Yeah. But it's not anything. It's just, they're being jerks or protecting their IPs.

1229
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:30,340
That's what it's always Nintendo didn't do it. They would, you wouldn't be able to have their

1230
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:34,980
IPs anymore. It's like, I don't know about that though. Like they're not really, it's not like

1231
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:41,140
someone's creating a game called Zelda out there that that's a little different than someone making

1232
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:45,940
a documentary about a game that was canceled. That's not protecting their ID. That's just like,

1233
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:51,700
we're just not suing you because that's, it's not something that was worth our time.

1234
01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:57,460
People do like the unauthorized behind the toll scene story about the cast of full house and

1235
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:01,860
things like that, or these books and stuff. They don't get shut down, you know, even though the

1236
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:06,020
stories are less than kind to some of the people that were on it, you know, it's one of those,

1237
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:11,220
they don't, they can't shut that stuff down. It's, it's documentary from people that were there

1238
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:16,260
telling what's going on and sometimes interpreted into a lifetime movie and that stuff. Or what was

1239
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:22,020
the other one they did recently, the saved by the bell, uh, behind the scenes thing. And that was a,

1240
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:27,540
you know, disaster too, but you can't stop that. So it's, it's wild to me that Nintendo can get

1241
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:31,620
away with it, but it's because YouTube unfortunately doesn't tend to side with the content creators,

1242
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:33,380
even though I thought they were supposed to start doing that.

1243
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:37,540
It's well, right. But it's there. Well, they're not going to take a stance at all,

1244
01:56:37,540 --> 01:56:43,060
but it's more of, there is a process in place for this, but what that process would be is that

1245
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:50,260
you counterclaim it or you, you say, listen, you know, I am, you know, not,

1246
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:54,580
I'm counterclaiming your claim or something like that. Basically saying that, no, your claim is

1247
01:56:54,580 --> 01:56:58,900
wrong. I am free to use this. And then you take it to the courts and then tend to win because they

1248
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:03,300
have more money than you. That's, that's really what it comes down to. And so, because people

1249
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:07,140
don't want to take it that far. Cause they're like, it's not worth, not worth it for me to

1250
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:13,460
be litigious about this, um, and defend this in court. So then of course, they're going to bully

1251
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:17,060
them into whatever they want. Uh, did your, um, S and chat says,

1252
01:57:17,060 --> 01:57:21,380
Nintendo of Japan doesn't understand. That's why this is all coming out of the Japanese office.

1253
01:57:21,380 --> 01:57:26,900
And that honestly, you write. It's slowly going to erode away though. Um,

1254
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:34,340
they're good will. Again, we need the gaming press that gets access to Nintendo to ask these

1255
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:37,940
types of accountability questions. I realized they don't want to pick up the phone and just say,

1256
01:57:37,940 --> 01:57:43,060
why did you pull that video? But Nintendo will be sooner rather than later promoting a new Zelda

1257
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:51,060
game, Tears of the Kingdom. And when that game is being promoted, it needs to be asked, um, why,

1258
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:56,100
you know, uh, since we're talking about a Zelda game, you, uh, once had a Zelda game that was in

1259
01:57:56,100 --> 01:58:00,260
production and there was a YouTube video that was trying to document some of this for history to,

1260
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:03,140
why did you copyright strike this? Why did you go after it?

1261
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:07,860
They just promoted that game at the game. Then I'm saying that, but this is what the

1262
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:14,500
gaming press isn't doing that they need to do. Ask these questions. When they're trying to promote

1263
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:17,940
their product, you got to follow up with the tough questions, but they don't want to because

1264
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:19,140
they'll lose access. I didn't realize they were working with

1265
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:25,700
Zeltik on, on the video though. Zeltik is a really good, uh, Zelda lore person.

1266
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:28,180
Yeah. Anyway.

1267
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:34,660
I was trying to check some of the, the archives, see if maybe someone had put it up.

1268
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:38,580
I'm sure someone's already. Oh, I'm sure once on the internet,

1269
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:43,380
always on the internet. If that master file is probably a torrent somewhere now. So, you know,

1270
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:48,580
I'm, I'm sure somebody within the, did you know, gaming side probably didn't let that

1271
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:53,780
video go to waste and I don't blame them whatsoever. All right. Uh, well speaking of

1272
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:59,140
Nintendo, I got one more story tonight and it's about Mario Kart 8, uh, Mario Kart 8 deluxe,

1273
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:03,220
which of course was released on the Nintendo switch some time ago, but remains one of the

1274
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:06,980
best-selling games on the platform. Like who doesn't have that game yet? I don't know. But

1275
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:13,780
anyway, uh, wave three of the booster course pack just came out and with it, a new customizability

1276
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:18,420
option for the items. Unfortunately, no, it doesn't let you customize the actual items.

1277
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:23,060
That would be kind of fun to turn the mushrooms and things, uh, into other items. But

1278
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:28,100
what it does let you do is it lets you, when you are going to play online,

1279
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:33,700
you can play a custom items mode via the free update that brought the booster pack as well.

1280
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:40,660
You can choose which items are used in offline versus races, meaning if you want to disable the

1281
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:48,980
blue shell and only the blue shell, you can do that now. Yay. So that's the whole type of thing

1282
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:53,860
that custom items is doing is, uh, allowing you to turn on and off what items you want to have

1283
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:57,620
in the race. Seems like such an obvious thing, but it's nice that it's there now, you know,

1284
01:59:57,620 --> 02:00:01,620
probably one of those things that really did come through with feedback about I'm sick and tired of

1285
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:07,300
those fucking blue shells. What can we do about it? So there you go. Uh, my depth also points out

1286
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:13,700
the lightning item got nerfed that I did not realize. Interesting. It probably needed it.

1287
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:16,820
Let's be real, but you could also turn that off. If you don't like that item,

1288
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:20,980
you could, you could have it be, uh, green shells and bananas only. If that's what you want.

1289
02:00:22,580 --> 02:00:27,540
I'll just as fuck the blue shell. I actually have a pin on my old purse. That's the blue

1290
02:00:27,540 --> 02:00:35,060
shell that says fuck you. It's all blue shells. It's all or play a giant one

1291
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:40,660
just so I could throw it at people. That would actually be really funny is like play a race.

1292
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:50,020
That's all blue shells. Like everybody carefully not being in first right up until the end. That'd

1293
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:56,420
be really funny. All right. Uh, that's, that's it for the stories we had on deck tonight. Um,

1294
02:00:56,420 --> 02:01:01,780
so we're going to look to you all in chat. If you have some questions for us over at twitch.tv slash

1295
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:06,020
vog and network, we'll take those now. Uh, of course, if you want to, uh, give us a call,

1296
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:10,180
you sure can over at vog network.com slash discord, just join the green room and we'll

1297
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:14,260
get to some calls. Um, let me ask Loki though, real quick, if there's any, uh, last minute

1298
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:19,220
stories or other things that came up that you want to bring up. Uh, right. Games is doing net ease

1299
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:26,740
over hyper fronts saying that it's copying Valorant. They do look very similar. Um,

1300
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:33,540
little too close. Yeah. Uh, all of our creative choices are mirrored in net eases game. Uh,

1301
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:38,580
we don't think that changing the color of the character ability or slightly modifying the visual

1302
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:43,300
appearance changes the fact that it's copyright infringement. It's like the old saying you can

1303
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:48,100
put lipstick on a pig, but it's still pig. I love the fact that he added that the end,

1304
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:55,540
um, comments in chat, um, on other games, uh, Phil of nine says I was shook when I logged into spell

1305
02:01:55,540 --> 02:02:01,060
break today and saw a countdown timer for the server shutting down. I had no idea. Only 29

1306
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:05,060
days left. Yeah. I missed that. That game was doing the same thing for a DVD mobile.

1307
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:11,060
DVD mobile's shutting down. It's going to be delisted, I think for revamp or something,

1308
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:17,140
but it has to do with net ease. Oh, interesting. Huh? Yeah. Like they're saying like, if you want

1309
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:22,740
to download it, do it now, which I think I already have it on both of my devices, even though I don't

1310
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:28,180
play it. I think I had it once on my phone, but I got rid of it for the space. But maybe if I

1311
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:33,300
have it in my history, I can still grab it. I don't know. Weird. Uh, that sometimes,

1312
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:40,260
no, if it's, if the content is removed, then it's gone. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

1313
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:45,140
Then you'll need to like that, that may be emulator that made its way onto the store

1314
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:48,740
that I grabbed on my iPad before it was removed. You certainly can't redownload that. So yeah,

1315
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:56,580
they can, they can PT things that they have to, I get it. Um, let's see. Um, I can't see talking

1316
02:02:56,580 --> 02:03:00,900
about the Mario Kart story pointing out. It could be good for tournaments. That's true,

1317
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:03,140
but look out. Cause if you hold a Nintendo tournament,

1318
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:09,300
you might be up for a whole other disaster by the way. Didn't,

1319
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:14,340
did, uh, didn't, wasn't there more follow-up on that whole saga this week? Like that guy,

1320
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:18,820
that CEO resigned, I think I read. Yeah. They, they, they, they let the CEO go,

1321
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:23,540
but well, he resigned to CEO, but he still owns the thing. So I don't know if that really makes

1322
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:31,380
a difference allegedly. Um, so yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Uh, great question from, I can't

1323
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:36,420
see in our chat. How do we email questions? I have a big one for next time. Please participate

1324
02:03:36,420 --> 02:03:41,700
at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send those emails, uh, fill of nine with a good

1325
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:46,740
question. What are y'all gaming over the holiday break? What are y'all gaming over the holiday

1326
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:52,900
break me? I don't have much of a holiday break, so I don't feel like I exactly have an opportunity

1327
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:57,460
to get caught up on a backlog, so to speak, but I really want to finish Pokemon scarlet.

1328
02:03:57,460 --> 02:04:01,380
I really do. Like I'm missing these Charizard events and it's making me sad.

1329
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:04,740
So I want to do, I want to finish Pokemon scarlet. That's for sure.

1330
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:15,220
Um, um, I was going to say I'll do, uh, probably lead Minecraft. And then I do want to play high

1331
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:23,700
on life a little bit. Cause that looks stupid. Nice. Um, um, we're probably doing our, our retro

1332
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:31,540
game thing, um, on new year's Eve. So we'll see how that goes, but I'm going to keep playing the

1333
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:35,860
stuff I've been playing. I might want to make a cameo. I think I mentioned that last week.

1334
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:40,740
I'm booked until like nine 30, but you know, I'll come over for the actual countdown,

1335
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:48,020
play some pinball. And if you, and if you want to, you know, actually, uh, play, uh,

1336
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:54,100
on stream with me at some point too, or even not, I'm always down to play. I'm sure. Uh,

1337
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:58,660
another question in our chat. Hello. Hello. Uh, poncho 72 is in our chat. Longtime listener,

1338
02:04:58,660 --> 02:05:02,660
first time viewer. Well, welcome. Thanks for being here poncho. Uh, I like the burger time

1339
02:05:02,660 --> 02:05:07,780
mentioning. So when we, for those that are only on the podcast feed and haven't been here on Twitch,

1340
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:13,540
uh, poncho seat notices that I have an arcade one up, which is a burger time machine behind me.

1341
02:05:13,540 --> 02:05:18,740
Essentially it's a data East collection because it has, you know, caveman ninja has bad dudes and

1342
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:23,620
karate champ are all on it as well. Um, but it's a burger time cabinet. And I always said from a

1343
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:28,100
long time ago that if I could ever get a burger time machine in my house, I'd get one and the

1344
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:32,660
arcade went up close enough. It's a limited edition too. They only made like 4,000 of them.

1345
02:05:32,660 --> 02:05:38,420
And, um, I was hoping to move some things around this weekend, but, um,

1346
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:44,260
there's something waiting. That's all I'm going to say right now. I need to make a little space.

1347
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:47,700
So, uh, tune in next week. That should all be taken care of. I have to get a,

1348
02:05:48,260 --> 02:05:52,660
I have to get an extension cord to set things up the way I want to, but, uh, stay tuned for that.

1349
02:05:52,660 --> 02:05:57,940
But anyway, uh, the real question that poncho 72 had here was, do you guys have any thoughts on the

1350
02:05:58,340 --> 02:06:05,060
Evercade thinking about getting one? Um, ironically, I mean, no Evercade, those, those

1351
02:06:05,060 --> 02:06:11,140
Evercade are the, um, the little portable devices that have the cartridges with packs on them. And

1352
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:16,500
there was, there was a data East one recently because I think that data East one is on sale.

1353
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:25,300
Um, so, uh, yeah, I, I don't own one, so I can't give you impressions. Uh, but I, I kind of want

1354
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:29,380
one like that portable one that's coming out here. Pretty soon. They have a portable one and

1355
02:06:29,380 --> 02:06:34,660
they have one that you hook up to your TV and like the cartridges work in both. Right. Yeah.

1356
02:06:34,660 --> 02:06:39,220
It's all universal. Uh, as Joe and her mat says that Evercade exp was interesting. And then I saw

1357
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:43,780
that story about their entire stock being stolen. Yeah. But there's a lot of, like, there's a lot of

1358
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:47,940
cartridges for that, uh, Evercade thing now. Like, aren't they up to something like 20 different

1359
02:06:47,940 --> 02:06:52,900
cartridges at least. Oh, it's more than that. I think. Yeah. It's really been growing. I,

1360
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:59,060
I want to get one. Maybe, uh, I was going to say I'll ask Santa for one, but Santa already, uh,

1361
02:06:59,060 --> 02:07:08,100
took care of business this year. So maybe in the future, 27. Okay. There's 27 retro cartridges.

1362
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:12,260
So like a links collection, a code master in television, those types of questions,

1363
02:07:12,260 --> 02:07:17,060
37, I think. And then for arcade cartridges, they have another eight,

1364
02:07:17,060 --> 02:07:23,460
but then they have a Commodore 64 cartridge as well, which, you know, I'm all about that. So,

1365
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:27,300
yeah, I kind of want an Evercade honestly. Yeah. They have like the Intellivision stuff. There's

1366
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:34,260
also, um, uh, the, some of the nest maker people have games on there. Yeah. So it's not just love

1367
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:40,340
to get mine on there. Yeah. Right. They have two, they have two collections of those. I will sell

1368
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:47,460
I will sell very cheap, like very, very cheap. Yeah. You can just put that on there and fine.

1369
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:51,220
You need to email somebody over there. How do I get myself one of the collections or something

1370
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:56,020
or figure out the producers of the prior ones and figure out their email or something. There's

1371
02:07:56,020 --> 02:08:00,020
way there's ways to figure it out. Like, I know the people like that have had games. I like,

1372
02:08:00,020 --> 02:08:04,820
I recognize their games. I they're in the community. I just don't know like how you

1373
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:10,260
would even get on these cards. Yeah. Pancho 72 says I almost bought the home and handheld one

1374
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:16,180
for $150. So yeah, I I'm thinking about it. Like, you know, it's obviously this time of year kind

1375
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:20,900
of stinks money wise, but that might be something I'm eyeing for early next year. I think the

1376
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:24,980
Evercade is a pretty cool concept. So yeah, the home one now is only a hundred bucks too.

1377
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:31,060
I still know what it is. I'm, I'm wanting, that's lots of steam gift cards.

1378
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:37,220
So I can buy one game. Oh, the Marvel $100 costume edition.

1379
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:42,740
Yeah. I want to play midnight sons and I want the season pass. So the ultimate edition is like

1380
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:44,980
a hundred bucks. I understand.

1381
02:08:46,820 --> 02:08:51,700
It's annoying me and my love of having all the outfits and characters.

1382
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:58,980
No, I get it. I get it. Um, as Joe and Matt says, I did see a review that the older Evercade

1383
02:08:58,980 --> 02:09:03,860
cartridges have problems with the exp, mostly just size. Like you can't get the card out of

1384
02:09:03,860 --> 02:09:08,500
the system when it's in, but there are a fair, apparently fixing the newer exp models. The one,

1385
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:13,140
that's the ones that were stolen cheese. That's too bad about the stolen ones, but

1386
02:09:14,180 --> 02:09:17,460
well, thank you for the question Pancho. And if you do get your hands on an Evercade,

1387
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:21,860
I'd love to hear more about it. Um, and I, I, it doesn't sound like anyone in chat has one yet.

1388
02:09:21,860 --> 02:09:26,180
It's definitely on my radar, uh, just because, uh, I love the idea of the, the fact that the

1389
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:31,220
cartridges are home and portable. Um, but just to get the arcade machines, you know,

1390
02:09:31,220 --> 02:09:36,980
pretty relatively reliably on like the big screen, I think is always a lot of fun. So nice.

1391
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:41,940
All right. Well with that, I think we're out of stories and that means we're out of show. So we

1392
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:46,340
should go around and get everybody's final thoughts. Yeah. I, I, I, Oh yeah. I should,

1393
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:50,340
I guess I should. I knew that, but the listeners didn't. Sorry. Yes. There was no email tonight.

1394
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:53,540
Participate at orange launch radio.com. If you'd like to send an email for a future week,

1395
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:58,020
which it sounds like somebody in chat did, which is great. Um, all right. Let's, uh,

1396
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:00,980
go around and get everybody's final thoughts. I will say here at the end of the show though,

1397
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:05,380
thank you so much for, uh, downloading our show and listening to it. Uh, or if you were here live,

1398
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:09,220
that's awesome too. If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend,

1399
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:12,180
uh, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

1400
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:16,900
but we need more voices here to put out on air. So, uh, a nice five star review on a site like

1401
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:21,780
Spotify, iTunes, wherever it is, you found the show that goes an awful long way. Uh, also just

1402
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:25,540
sharing on social media is great too. Uh, you know, whatever you can do to get the word out,

1403
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:31,700
we appreciate it all. Thank you so much. Um, that's all I have to say here. So let's get

1404
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:36,420
final thoughts, dark Sakura. I imagine you are doing some Debbie delight tonight. I saw

1405
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:44,500
an RN chat. So I imagine y'all are off to have some fun. Yep. Go ahead and move on into the queue,

1406
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:49,700
opening up my game. And I would really appreciate it for people to hang around and chat with me

1407
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:54,020
because that's the most fun part is being able to have a peanut gallery.

1408
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:59,060
Uh, any final thoughts tonight? That was my final thought. Oh, okay.

1409
02:11:00,820 --> 02:11:04,420
All right. Oh no. Uh, give me steam cards. That's my final thought.

1410
02:11:04,420 --> 02:11:10,340
All right. Oh, what's your, what's your username? Dark Sarah, dark Sakura. Okay.

1411
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:14,420
Just making sure we send this, just making sure we send those steam cards to the right place.

1412
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:20,580
That's all. You'll see a neon cherry blossom. Okay. I'm pretty sure that's the one I'm using.

1413
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:25,620
All right. All right. You can always issue a correction on social media if you need to. All

1414
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:30,980
right. Have a good one. Have a good stream. You too. Uh, Loki, your final thought for tonight.

1415
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:37,220
Uh, hopefully you'll see more content for me this week. I'm hoping to get a lot of it out.

1416
02:11:38,260 --> 02:11:41,220
Sounds good. Sounds like you're going to be hard at work this week.

1417
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:45,300
Yeah, hopefully. Uh, my final thought tonight. I don't, I don't

1418
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:52,260
have a lot. I'm just, um, just thankful to still be doing this show after all this time. And the

1419
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:57,540
fact that there's people that listen to it means the world. And, uh, yeah, just, uh, the holiday

1420
02:11:57,540 --> 02:12:01,780
season is really sneaking up on us. So I hope everyone has a good one and, uh, 2023 will be

1421
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:08,100
here before we know it, which I can't believe I'm going to be 45 next year. Like time fricking flies.

1422
02:12:08,100 --> 02:12:11,940
Can't believe it. All right. Well, that does it for another episode of orange launch radio.

1423
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:16,180
I hope you all have a wonderful night. Thank you so much. And we will see you next time. Bye
