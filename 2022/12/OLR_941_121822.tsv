0	20000	Not being much of an RPG person, I only now learned Final Fantasy 3 didn't see a release in the PS1 Final Fantasy releases Anthology Chronicles of Origins, not seeing release in the West until the Nintendo DS in 2006.
20000	27000	Two decades later, Screenix is releasing all six of the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters for PlayStation 4 and Switch next year. Apparently only physical releases?
27000	37000	This is the re-re-re-release news with probably 10 more reads needed. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
38000	60000	I think it's digital individually. But anyway, hi, hello out there, my friends on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with episode number 941 of our program for December the 18th of 2022.
60000	70000	A holiday season officially underway in many sorts. My name is Rob Roberts and I am here with my co-hosts as they are every week. Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70000	71000	Oh, hi.
71000	75000	Hello, hello and I hope you're having a good Hanukkah. It's it's night one.
75000	80000	It's great when I get to start setting stuff on fire and butchering Hebrew.
80000	81000	Perfect.
81000	82000	Yeah.
82000	83000	Sounds like a celebration.
83000	90000	It was I had everything all set up and then I was about to do the oil. I'm like, I don't want to do the oil this year. So I just got really good candles.
90000	100000	There you go. That works. I was up. I was actually playing Pokemon Go earlier today. I'll get into gaming weeks and stuff. But as I was trying to walk a lot.
100000	108000	I ended up as I often do down near the Capitol building and they had a little a whole little setup there. It's kind of off to the side.
108000	117000	But it's I don't want to make it sound like they kind of othered it because like if you're taking a shot like straight down at the Capitol, you have the big giant tree in the middle.
117000	125000	But now they have like a menorah that's on the right side that would show up in the frame too. And it looked like they they were probably I mean, I was there like three o'clock, so it was still light out.
125000	131000	I imagine they were going to do a big ceremony at sundown. But yeah, so it was nice to see that.
131000	140000	That's cool. Yeah. I haven't made any latkes yet. I've had some tummy trouble, but I'm planning on doing it at some point this week.
140000	148000	That was an OLR tradition I miss back when we were live and in person. We'd often get some potato pancakes on the first night of
149000	156000	The first night it happened to me that the show was on but yeah, and and the house would smell like potato deliciousness.
156000	158000	Mm hmm. Good times.
158000	161000	Maybe maybe one day.
161000	173000	Maybe one day one day we can you know what I'll eat potato latkes anytime I don't give a it's just I'll drink it I'll drink I'll eat a gingerbread cookie anytime like it doesn't have to be the holidays. Let's be clear.
173000	178000	Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
178000	179000	Hello.
179000	181000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
181000	182000	I'm doing pretty good.
182000	189000	You got one of my very faves playing behind you. I actually I can't tell if that's the stage from Jumpman or Jumpman Jr. on.
189000	197000	It's the original Jumpman on Commodore 64. Love it. One of my faves. Was that something you were playing this week?
197000	203000	Well, yeah, because I'm well, I met Randy Glover, the creator of Jumpman.
203000	204000	Oh, get out.
204000	206000	Well, how'd that happen?
206000	208000	And I also got I got this.
208000	217000	Oh, there was a convention. I there was a convention here in town. Wasn't there like one of those gamer expos over at the Scottish Rite?
218000	219000	Yeah.
219000	224000	And so he was there. They were they had Jumpman. I've never played Jumpman.
224000	229000	I played Jumpman Jr. and I was playing on the Coleco Vision, which is like, oh, yeah.
229000	236000	He's like, I didn't I forgot that there is one on the Coleco Vision, I guess, because he's like I did the Commodore 64 in Atari.
236000	240000	I don't know if he ported it or someone else ported it to the Coleco Vision.
240000	249000	But yeah, I did get the medium and then they had a raffle as well as going to charity. So I entered the raffle and I won.
249000	258000	Well, I had three choices. I get one bag of buttons, a second bag of buttons or the button that was on his shirt signed by him.
258000	263000	And so I got the button on his shirt signed by him that says creator of Jumpman.
263000	265000	Nice.
265000	271000	Nice. I didn't I didn't know in the gaming industry we took people's clothes and had them autographed.
271000	276000	I thought that was I thought that was just at the Magic Mike show. But here we are.
276000	284000	Yeah. So yeah. So yeah, I did. I met him this week. But yeah, I was like, Jumpman Jr. was like a game like my fave game.
284000	288000	Going back to the Coleco Vision. It was like one I played all the time.
288000	295000	In fact, when I got the Coleco Vision mini thing that they had, that was the reason why they had Jumpman Jr. in it.
295000	303000	So it's awesome. I really like that game. I am not very good at it, though, because, well, they had a Commodore 64 mini playing it.
303000	312000	And I was I've never used a Commodore 64 controller. I mean, it's sort of like an Atari controller, but I'm just not used to the old joysticks anymore.
312000	322000	So it's yeah, it's it's that game is like so touchy anyways, as it is like you have to be very precise with your jumps and like getting right to the edge and stuff.
322000	325000	That controller is not meant for that.
325000	335000	I was gonna say Jumpman Jr. is on the C64 mini as well. And I would imagine the C64 regular one that they just put out not long ago.
335000	340000	I don't know if I have 25 bucks to buy the cartridge.
340000	342000	The actual Coleco cartridge?
342000	344000	I've got two Coleco Visions.
344000	351000	Oh, wow. That's and you know, when you say cartridge, it's funny because a lot of people forget the Commodore 64 actually had cartridges as well.
351000	359000	And I actually had Jumpman Jr. as a cartridge on Commodore 64. So yeah, I always forget that that computer had cartridges, but it did.
359000	364000	So that's the version for Coleco Atom and Coleco Vision.
364000	370000	You know, that was a game I didn't have I had like Mouse Trap and Carnival and Space Fury and Turbo and stuff like that.
370000	379000	A lot of those ports back in the day were done by other people, though it wasn't often I mean, look at a game like Pitfall, right? David Crane's Pitfall for the Atari 2600.
379000	389000	That game was ported literally you name it in the 80s. They put Pitfall on it right in one form or another either Pitfall or Pitfall to the Lost Caverns was even on like the Sega Master System.
389000	394000	I think it's a port of the arcade game or something, but but I digress. They weren't all David Crane.
394000	409000	So it's interesting how, yeah, oftentimes other people would end up being responsible for translating, you know, a game over and with mixed success, sometimes look at, you know, Pac-Man on the 2600, an infamous example, certainly not done by the same folks.
409000	416000	If they were kind of behind some limitations, they're like, well, we need to we need you to fit this much game into this much space.
416000	420000	It's like, well, I can't do that without making compromises. Too bad.
420000	427000	You know, but yeah, I think I've seen that they've done like some fan conversions or stuff like that using a larger ROM in it.
427000	431000	It looks pretty close, but yeah, yeah, it was cool to meet him.
431000	435000	And of course, he is also behind Summer Games and Summer Games, too.
435000	442000	So, oh, yeah, epics they were given I wanted like because like the way it was working is like, OK.
442000	446000	The person that wins the raffle, you get to pick one thing and then it gets down to the end.
446000	451000	So they had a sealed copy of Jumpman for the Commodore 64.
451000	457000	I wanted that. And then they also had a Commodore 64 mini. I would have taken that, but they're fine. It's fine.
457000	459000	Yeah, the pins fun. That's fun.
459000	464000	I want to hear more about the convention, but I do want to go to our chat room, of course, and get some comments because we do tape live every Sunday night.
464000	471000	At nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
471000	476000	That's VOG Network. And we're on right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although Bobby Black Wolf not on tonight,
476000	480000	as him and Mrs. Black Wolf are celebrating the holidays a little bit early this year.
480000	483000	But Bobby will be back next week on December 25th.
483000	486000	Yes, even on that day with a new episode of his program.
486000	491000	And I know he has missed you all because he was out last week as well, but he'll be back next week.
491000	498000	So hello to everybody in chat. Tigerclaw pointing out Jumpman was Mario's original name, if I recall.
498000	502000	Yeah, that was his name when he was the villain in Donkey Kong.
502000	506000	Or no, I'm sorry. Hello. He's the villain in Donkey Kong Jr. Hello, bang bang.
506000	510000	He was a hero in Donkey Kong. But yes, I believe they did call him Jumpman in that game.
510000	511000	Yeah, yeah.
511000	521000	So I wonder if maybe because of Jumpman Jr's success, because Jumpman and Jumpman Jr, those games weren't just big in the US.
521000	526000	Keep in mind, the Commodore 64 was huge in the UK. Huge.
526000	533000	So I wonder if because Jumpman kind of ended up being part of the pop culture, you know, lexicon over there, they had to find a new name.
533000	536000	I don't know. I mean, it would be an interesting documentary someday.
537000	542000	Far above the ZX Spectrum and its other computer systems.
542000	545000	So the CDC, all that.
545000	556000	Yeah, all of it. You know, it's so funny how in this day and age, we're always like, oh, it's PlayStation versus Microsoft versus Nintendo when like in the 80s, there were like 10 different things all competing at once.
556000	566000	There. I mean, I remember I'm dating myself, I don't care. I remember magazine ads that would show off a game like let's say I think actually mousetrap would be a good example.
566000	573000	And it would say it was Oh, actually, it was always like the Parker Brothers ones for Commodore 64. Like Frogger. Frogger is a great example.
573000	580000	It would have here's everything the Commodore version, the Apple two version, the TI 99 4a version.
580000	581000	Amiga.
582000	584000	Maybe not for that particular game, but later ones. Yes.
585000	591000	The and the 2600, the 5200, the Coleco vision, the it was it was literally everything.
591000	598000	I remember the Tandy computer. Oh, yeah, the cartridge that you shoved it up on the side of it and the silver keys.
598000	612000	Can one of you can one of you Google experts like Tiger Claw or something since I'm live trying to do a program could what do you find like one of those 80s ads that shows that like look for like an old Frogger ad or like Popeye I think had one if you remember that game.
612000	616000	I would just love to like show that on screen as like an example here.
616000	632000	And and have a little better detail for those that are listening on the podcast feed because even though we do tape live on Sunday nights, of course, we are available as a podcast as well on most of the places where you can find podcasts such as Spotify or iTunes or what have you.
632000	642000	Tiger Claw sent me a YouTube link. I was looking more for a picture but I can't like upload the thing but yeah, I see here. I'll post it in chat real fast.
642000	650000	Um, but yeah, it's basically got a bunch of different versions of the game box floating in water.
650000	662000	So it's like in, in television, like in the 80s. That's close. That's close. Yeah, I see what you're doing with all the different boxes. That's close. I saw the one depth put to the, those are close but it's not the one I'm thinking of.
662000	679000	Well, but you know what ads looks like back then where it wasn't just like like ads today or like, here's a picture, you know, yeah, and then, you know, and then in the past, it was like, here's a complete novel and backstory of every one of these games, I found
679000	684000	it I found it okay how do I get this image copy image address. Okay.
684000	697000	Yes, this is what I'm going to let me show this on the other screen here sorry I am doing this is the joy of doing things live sometimes but I'm doing it live. So, what you can see here this is an ad for Popeye, and you actually see all the different screens it
697000	708000	shows the 5200 the Commodore 64 I'm going to put this link in chat as well. The Atari 400 and 800, which I which I even forgot was a system.
708000	721000	So and so on. So that's, that's, yeah, it shows like all the different systems there. I'll put that link in chat to I promise, just easy, but you could just see the scope of like all the systems that things were on. So it's just, it's just wild. Anyway.
721000	735000	All right. Loki, I said I said I would ask you about the convention. So what else did you see? Because what's funny, I got pushed a Facebook ad for that convention. And it was the first time I'd heard of it, but I got the Facebook ad on Saturday night. So it was like the thing was half
735000	738000	over already. And I was like, well, I'm not gonna go today.
738000	758000	And I didn't stay very long. There's not a lot to do there. If you unless you're watching panels, which I wasn't the whole reason I was going there was because there was some people I wanted to give physical copies of my game to just because either promotion or I figured they would enjoy it like john riggs.
759000	777000	One he he does. He has a YouTube channel. He's got like, like gaming nostalgia stuff that he does. And I've been wanting to send him one for a while. And I just haven't really bothered to look up his PO box or whatever. And so I saw that he was going to be in town. So I was like, Okay, cool. I'll go give one to him. And then
778000	797000	so he was there. And so I got to meet with him and talk about like he does some game dev as well a little bit with his friend. And so he had a few games that he was selling as well. So we got to do that. And then he actually bought a copy off of me as well for his friend. So I actually sold one.
798000	822000	And then there was who else was there? Joey Ferris with game explain. So I saw him there. I've recognized him forks. I think I follow him on YouTube as well. And then I know gamer dad was there. And there's one other guy I don't remember I think it may have been this Gabbo the giver, who is like this pixel game squad thing. They they look for NES games and stuff.
822000	826000	I'm gonna assume all these content creators are based out of SAC or the Bay Area.
826000	833000	I don't think so. I know. John Riggs is not I don't think content creators specifically.
856000	860000	Oh, God, you can't do my voicemail. Yeah, yeah, I bet.
886000	901000	Sung in Mortal Kombat two as well. So, yeah, they had a different, different group. Daniel. He's, he's also a doctor, apparently. So he has a book called Mortal doctor, which I think that's funny.
916000	945000	They usually were set up. So they didn't really want to play anything. I walked around the vendor booth area a little bit about Contra knows about it. Like, I don't know, there was stuff that was kind of expensive, like in specially they had games that were marked up quite a bit in the condition that they were in was just not good. I was looking for some indie games and stuff, too. They've had a few guys that had a indie NES games and stuff. They're not homebrew. And I was looking for some of that, but it just wasn't wasn't being it.
946000	975000	So we were in and out in about an hour, like, honestly. But I mean, it's fun if you like, you know, the panels and stuff and want to see like some of these people and get their autographs or whatever. It's a good time. I mean, and we lucked out because the last time we went, it was a week earlier. And that's in the middle of that stupid Sacramento marathon that they have the international one. So getting to the Scottish Rite Center was just a pain because it's the marathon run literally goes right past it.
975000	1002000	And so all the streets are blocked off, whereas this year is a week later. So it was just like, no traffic, easy in and out wasn't super crowded. So it's good. And I ended up giving away about like, four copies of the game and I sold one. So five, five pixel poops, number two out there. And funny enough, like, John Riggs had messaged his friend like showed him a picture what it was. And the guy's like, Oh, yeah, I just bookmark that page today. So
1003000	1004000	Wow.
1004000	1022000	Yeah, it'd be fun. Like if people just get the plate and stuff. The one there was digital clips was there too. And I should have talked about publishing, but I didn't didn't get around to it. So it's all right. You blew it off. You had your chance. Sorry.
1022000	1051000	Yeah, it's just awkwardly. Yeah, I get it. You have to be in the right mindset. Yeah, so it was it was okay. But yeah, that's really the whole reason I went is just to give out copies of the game. That sounds like fun. I haven't got it. I got to make more because I'm out. Well, I have two left, but I'm out of physical copies of the first 12 at least I wish I'd known I would have gone. I just Yeah, it wasn't on my radar, unfortunately. So yeah, it's too bad. But I have to keep an eye out for the next one. So it's fun. Yeah. All right. Well, let's get into some gaming news.
1052000	1081760	We'll come back and talk about our gaming weeks. We want to definitely get Dark Soccer's gaming week and I have some stuff too. So we'll get to that. But first, let's get into our kind of lead topic for tonight. Although I mean, this is this is kind of an ongoing saga. And let's be real. We're getting into that time of year, you know, with with a Hanukkah starting us off tonight. We all know then that it's Christmas, then it's New Year's all the other winter celebrations as well. We know that the news is going to slow down a little bit. So but we'll, we'll push through with what's out there. We still have some ongoing developments in the
1082060	1086200	Microsoft and Activision Blizzard saga. Yes, Loki.
1087440	1111920	Yeah, so there's just more news coming out about that. And I think they've already kind of said that as well. But Microsoft offered Sony call it I mean, first off, they've offered Sony Call of Duty on their platform for 10 years if they're willing to sign an agreement for it. And then also with that, you know, they're saying that, you know, they also offer to put it on their PlayStation Plus
1111920	1141080	service as well, to kind of, you know, be an extra thing that they could offer for their new users to kind of spice up PlayStation Plus and make it a little bit more valuable, I guess. But I still think that they're basically saying that's still not enough. And same, I think like the FTC and like the European Union are also investigating everything because they feel that it's not competitive enough.
1141080	1171000	Once again, like, I get it, it is not it, it is the lack of competition. But like, why this and not discovery? Like, that's, I still, I'm still like scratching my head over that way. Because like, like, I get it, this could harm Sony down the road. But at the same time, like they would do the same in a heartbeat. Like, I, I don't doubt it. But you know, when I see that type of merger, like with discovery and Warner Brothers and HP and all
1171000	1199240	that stuff, like, I feel more harm is being done there. And like, then this, granted, and I'm sure that Sony sees the writing on the wall, like even a 10 year agreement doesn't, that's 10 years, that's like, you know, another console cycle, and then they have the advantage in that they see that that could be a problem. But I guarantee if this doesn't go through, they will try to buy do the same thing. And then in ironically, it'll probably go through because that's how the world works.
1199560	1229120	I'm looking in chat for some comments. DJ Rama S in chat says Sony needs to stop whining. As 2100 Matt says, I think we all know if the roles were reversed, Sony would offer MS nothing. They tell him to kick rocks. I feel MS is going out of their way to make this work. I'm actually curious if there's anyone in chat, and I promise no judgment. We want to get all the voices here. I'm curious if there's anyone out there that maybe agrees with the FTC side of thing and does not want to see the Microsoft and Activision Blizzard merger go through and maybe what the reasons are for
1229120	1258920	that. I mean, admittedly, and I kind of my opinion really hasn't changed. What I said a couple weeks ago is it's like I don't love the dog eat big dog sort of thing that the games industry is becoming. I don't love it. But it's this particular circumstance where something needs to change at activism Blizzard where I'm fine with it. Even though yes, I realize it's a huge company. Microsoft's also a huge company and it is going to give them a huge share of it. I I'm not sure I'm convinced it's giving them a larger share than what Sony has.
1258920	1288800	Sony Sony has a large entertainment arm that they could integrate better with PlayStation that they're simply not doing. And I've said this before on the show, PlayStation Plus, how much of a bigger deal would that be if it actually gave you some Sony movies? Some Sony music, right? I guess it does give you like Crunchyroll, which is Sony owned or like a trial or something. I don't know. Like it gives you some limited Sony things, but it's it's not at the level that you
1288800	1308760	would expect Sony could offer where Microsoft doesn't have a CD label or a music label or that I Well, a large one, a major one, I should say that I know of, or an entertainment production company, really. So it's, I think it's Sony's own fault. They're not leveraging things more. I don't know.
1308760	1337240	And, and they are doing the same thing on a smaller level. I mean, they're making individual deals with different game studios to basically put it on their platform for a year before it gets to go on any other console platform. And they do that quite often. And they gate a bunch of stuff like Spider-Man in, you know, a lot of it funny enough is around Square Enix, but like gating off Spider-Man from the whole Microsoft platform for the Marvel Avengers game.
1337960	1367000	Which is just stupid. But that's something that they do. Yeah, I really don't I have a hard time believing like, at least, you know, you have this company that's saying, Listen, we're committed to bringing this to your platform still. Like, I mean, if it were me, like, like, after all this bullshit, I'd be like, you know, all that Skyrim stuff and all the new Elder Scrolls games. Well, fuck you guys ain't getting shit now.
1367400	1379880	causes problems with Activision. We're, we're fucking cutting that shit off. Yeah. I don't know, like, I would be, I mean, that's what's gonna come is, you know, yeah, oh, yeah, starfield, Nat, you ain't getting that shit.
1380840	1406480	I also kind of wonder, like with Microsoft being willing to make so many concessions on the Activision side, if it if it isn't really Blizzard, maybe King, but I feel like it's Blizzard that they really want. Like, I feel like Microsoft really wants Diablo, Warcraft, Overwatch, and that whole that even though I don't know, I'm hearing that maybe Overwatch two isn't performing at the level that people thought it would.
1406480	1436360	I don't know. I feel like a lot of that stuff I'm looking at is kind of slanted based on people's biases one way or the other. So I'm not I'm not sure what the facts really say about that. But it seemed like Overwatch two at least had a huge launch. But admittedly, they just had a new season start. And I could care less, but I'm playing a different Blizzard product. So maybe it maybe it's all the same as long as as long as I'm doing something right. But anyway, my point is, I wonder if it's Blizzard that Microsoft really has their eye on. I don't know.
1437000	1445320	Maybe I mean, I don't know, like, we'll have to see what happens to this whole thing anyways. Because like, what's gonna happen to Activision? Like if this doesn't go through?
1445320	1475080	I don't know. They get bought by Tencent. And then I believe that would actually be worse. I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash a vog network. Mike deaf says I don't agree with the FTC. I understand why people would be fine with it. But this is a good move for everyone. At least involved. As Joe and her mat says this will take a lot longer now that these antitrust suits that are coming. It's really not going to be finalized one way or another until 2024. So DJ rama says PlayStation is keeping Sony afloat. Yeah.
1475320	1505280	And also adds Microsoft teamed up with crunchyroll for free trial subs. She hold 10 says I would rather Xbox set spend the 70 billion on a new super game and studio from the ground up. To be fair, Microsoft did buy a boatload of studios. They do have a lot of those. And I'm not sure we're seeing oodles and oodles of things coming out of it yet. But I think we're gonna like I think it's coming. And we've seen a few I you know, obviously, we had like Psychonauts two, you know, we'll, we'll see some more. But to be fair, they did
1505280	1513480	spend a lot of money on like smaller studios to try to build them some some new things. I can't see what's up.
1514040	1520320	Whatever happens. I'd like to see though that the biggest defenders get canned immediately.
1520640	1534760	Oh, God. Yeah, that's that's the number one thing I can't wait for is for Bobby Kotick to be unceremoniously removed. I mean, it sucks because he's probably gonna get a big payout because of contracts and stuff. But not just him. Oh, no, yeah, not just him. But he's he's he's like
1534760	1554080	that. He's he's the it's just like eBroom plus is not the only problem at bird app right now. But he's the one you want to see go most of all. But he has he has a team of enablers just like Bobby Kotick does. So I don't know. Anyway,
1554080	1559240	thing is, is that in the long run, though, all of these people that are like this are a symptom of a bigger problem.
1559240	1561480	Oh, sure. Absolutely.
1562040	1566800	Yeah, when you start holding those people accountable, the problem starts getting resolved.
1566800	1575880	Yeah. And that's, I've referenced that on previous episodes, too, is that this is a game industry problem. That's what this this whole issue became much bigger than Blizzard is
1575880	1580960	much more than a gaming industry issue. Oh, sure. This is institutionalized.
1580960	1582960	Sure. I'll agree with that. Yeah.
1584280	1590720	It's just the fact that it comes out in the biggest boys club that there is, but you see it all over the place in the corporate world.
1591120	1593040	It's exacerbated by the gaming industry.
1593040	1595960	This is what it's like to work as a female.
1596760	1599520	Just saying it doesn't matter where you go.
1599520	1605760	Even the most enlightened of companies, you're still going to you're still going to encounter sexism.
1605960	1608520	It's it's there. It's ingrained.
1608520	1613760	You have to start holding people to the fire in the worst possible way to get it to change.
1614280	1614960	I don't disagree.
1616120	1618160	Going back to chat with more comments.
1618160	1622480	I can't see in chat says as a new Xbox gamer, I want it to go through.
1622720	1626000	But I also don't want gaming to be like the movie and TV industry.
1626000	1630680	I don't like having content locked behind subscriptions, subscriptions add up.
1630680	1638920	And that's maybe a reference towards what I'm assuming is Xbox Game Pass and how a lot of stuff is being invested in that.
1639160	1644440	And we kind of see the whole like Netflix of gaming type of contest going on there.
1644440	1646680	So I get that.
1647480	1651960	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, Overwatch is still a seller in terms of the esports aspect.
1652280	1655040	The game still does well on the streamed tournament circuit.
1655080	1658120	Oh, maybe. Maybe Microsoft wants Overwatch League.
1659520	1660840	That could very well be possible.
1660840	1661160	I don't know.
1661160	1663600	Blizzard doesn't want Overwatch League, so I mean.
1665880	1672360	But I can understand where maybe if you have that infrastructure that Overwatch League has set up,
1672680	1677800	maybe Microsoft can leverage that into getting more eyes on something like, I don't know, Halo Reach.
1677800	1689000	I'm reaching admittedly, but, you know, something that, you know, gets the other Microsoft competitive games that they would like to have at that same level.
1689560	1690120	I don't know.
1690120	1695160	I acknowledge I'm reaching a little bit, but, you know, who knows?
1695760	1698120	Only Microsoft knows for sure what their motivations are.
1699200	1699680	All right.
1699880	1705560	Well, let's talk about our motivations and the types of games that we have been playing this week in a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week?
1705560	1707000	And we will start with DarkSakura.
1707000	1707840	How was your gaming week?
1709960	1711360	It was it was all right.
1711920	1713760	It was the usual stuff, Dead by Daylight.
1715920	1723600	Lots of funny shenanigans, I've been playing a lot with Gwen and with one of my newer streamer buddies, Raven McPherse.
1724480	1725320	Really fun.
1726320	1733120	Um, I have been playing my stupid wordscapes game, like pretty hardcore lately.
1734160	1740680	Um, I have been playing a lot of pinball, just, you know, the stuff we have in my house.
1740680	1746480	I actually tried to play some Twilight Zone the other day and I forgot that it doesn't have a ball save.
1746960	1747440	Oops.
1748440	1753080	Um, and, uh, I played some Colds of the Lamb.
1753160	1757000	I'm actually, I've actually beaten it and now I've gotten all of the tarot cards.
1757440	1761960	So I'm trying to figure out what I have left to do in the game other than start a new play through.
1762640	1766520	Um, and I'm on the third leg of Final Fantasy 5.
1766560	1769080	We're just about to go to the Fork Tower.
1769760	1776480	Um, and then after that's done, I was going to put it up between Star Ocean and Emerald Dragon.
1776800	1780120	But if I played Emerald Dragon, I would want to play the PC Engine version.
1780120	1787920	Um, so I'd have to set up the capture and then find a patch that I can run on, uh, run simultaneously with my, with my disc copy.
1788240	1790360	Cause I do own an original Emerald Dragon.
1790360	1795480	It's not a very expensive game, but I think Star Ocean would be a lot easier to do.
1796000	1798320	So I'm probably going to be playing Star Ocean next.
1798960	1799280	Nice.
1801040	1802880	All right, we'll move on to Loki.
1802880	1807200	I know we talked about the, uh, uh, convention you were at this weekend, but what else for your gaming week?
1807720	1810800	It was pretty much just Jumpman and Minecraft.
1811080	1813000	It was all Minecraft this week.
1813040	1818240	Just, um, working on, uh, editing for different videos and stuff like that.
1818280	1820720	I was gonna say, this was your big week off to produce.
1820720	1826520	Yeah, you know, like it was, but it didn't, I don't feel as productive as I should have been.
1826600	1830920	Um, even though like I wasn't wasting time, it just, it doesn't feel like I got a lot done.
1831320	1841440	I was hoping to get multiple videos done, but I got a short out, which technically was done weeks ago, but, uh, I published that and that did okay.
1841520	1853000	Um, but yeah, I needed to do more shorts because, um, that seemed to be, it's a really quick, like 3000 views and, um, I got like a few subs out of it too.
1853000	1854680	So it's not bad.
1854720	1856760	It's good for, um, getting noticed.
1856760	1864120	And then, um, just, yeah, I've been working on, uh, the episode for the modded series, uh, which I'm almost done with.
1864160	1865720	Hopefully I'll have that out either.
1866080	1866960	It'll probably be tomorrow.
1867040	1874040	And then, um, I still be, I don't even know I'm going to work on for the SMB stuff for channel 64.
1875600	1880000	I mean, I know what I should work on, but I don't know if it's gonna, gonna happen.
1880000	1882840	And I need to work on more of the, the mega base stuff.
1882880	1885120	Um, but I also have vault hunters.
1885120	1886120	I just started to that.
1886120	1890400	Haven't filmed anything in yet, or at least I've, I've keep filming things and then deleting it.
1890400	1900360	Cause I can't, uh, well, windows updates decide to, um, tweak on my audio and video settings, which is fun.
1900360	1906800	So like I kept one, my audio was recording incredibly quiet to the point where I couldn't even hear it.
1907440	1914080	Um, thanks to it, enabling some stupid program that I don't normally have launch anyways.
1914080	1920680	It's like some thing that some companion program that came with my, uh, I mean, I guess it's an audio driver
1920680	1921920	because we don't have sound cards anymore.
1922440	1931160	Um, and then like OBS change settings where the, um, there was an audio delay, like a two second audio delay
1931160	1938760	that was unfixable because windows 10, when it updated, switched my audio from 44 to 48.
1939240	1943240	Um, and so it was annoying.
1943440	1949480	So I finally figured that out and track that down, but it was getting to the point where like, I'd have to sync my
1949560	1956000	mic audio and the video that sync the video and its own audio to get it to work right.
1956040	1959960	And that takes, you know, multiply that times the number of clips I have in there.
1960360	1963560	It just really compounds and adds a lot more time to everything.
1963560	1966520	So now that it's all fixed, it should be more streamlined going forward.
1966520	1970280	It's just, you know, figuring that out over the few days, um, took a while.
1971200	1976880	Um, but yeah, I had fun this week and I mean, I'm going to have some more time throughout, you know,
1976880	1981480	the next couple of weeks because, you know, we have the holidays, so 40 weekends and stuff like that.
1981520	1986240	Um, so yeah, I should be able to work on a little bit more of that as well.
1986560	1988960	Um, I'm hoping to get more into the groove in it.
1988960	1993480	I know we've, um, got some exciting things around the corner with, you know, the SMPs.
1993480	1996240	So, you know, new year will be fun too.
1996800	2001600	Um, and then my Minecraft, I mean, Mojang has been super quiet about their updates.
2001600	2005000	So, I mean, who knows when that's coming?
2005000	2009520	So we may have tons of time left before we have to reset the server or something.
2010320	2012800	You know, you were talking about, you were talking about YouTube shorts.
2013200	2016320	Have you tried, uh, syndicating your content on TikTok as well?
2016760	2021520	I know, I know, I'm just talk and, uh, Instagram stories and stuff like that.
2021520	2025160	Taken me years to figure it out, but I finally got sucked into TikTok a little bit.
2025160	2027880	And I will tell you that algorithm for discovering stuff.
2027920	2031280	I, it, it's, it, it does it better than any other platform.
2031280	2031920	Let me tell you.
2032200	2036800	And I'm seeing stuff as I go through my feed, I see stuff with like zero likes and zero comments.
2036960	2040920	So I know occasionally it pushes stuff that it thinks I'm going to like in there.
2040920	2044920	And that's how these things are getting lots of views because people don't just watch one TikTok.
2044920	2046600	They watch like 20 all at once.
2046600	2050960	And so they'll see some that are from their usuals and then it sneaks some new ones in there.
2050960	2052520	So it's, it's interesting.
2052560	2054560	That whole TikTok space is very interesting to me.
2054880	2060000	So I need to sit down like, and just knock out because I've set up a template with this first one.
2060000	2061720	So it took a little bit longer to make the short.
2061760	2070560	Um, but I have a template now set up where I should be able to just go back to my older videos and start with just like the, the build time lapses.
2070600	2075520	And condense those down to a minute and then just upload those and schedule them out.
2075640	2083160	And then, um, I'll have to go through some of the other stuff and find clips that I like, like funny things or something like that and do all that.
2083480	2088680	Um, but yeah, like this first one was my first major build that was on my first S and P.
2088680	2091440	So that's like over a year old now.
2091440	2092600	It's like almost two years old.
2092680	2100320	And so I'm starting there and kind of going more towards current, I mean, mix it up, I don't know, it might not be in order, but.
2100680	2102440	But yeah, I got like really good engagement.
2102440	2108280	Like, you know, um, I think we got eight subs in about 3,100 views in like a day.
2108320	2108560	Yeah.
2108600	2111800	And it's, it's really weird how the, like the algorithm works with it.
2111840	2113520	It'll, it'll push it and it's gone.
2113720	2115320	Like there's no engagement after that.
2115760	2119000	So, but you know, you just do those every once in a while.
2119520	2122680	Even eight new subs from a short is great.
2122680	2125280	Like I, I'm excited as fuck.
2125280	2130480	If I get two new follows on a Twitch stream, I'm sure Jamie's in a similar boat where it's like, you get two new
2130480	2132240	followers, it's like, I had a great stream today.
2132880	2133400	Well, yeah.
2133440	2134400	And that's the thing.
2134400	2143520	It's most frustrating about YouTube is like, I will put in like a month worth of effort for a video or something like that and see like almost nothing from it.
2143600	2150840	And then I'll have one of my, um, you know, server partners, he'll start a hardcore series.
2151120	2158360	Where he's basically just building and he gets 600 subs out of it and just an immense amount of watch time from just like a video.
2158760	2162200	And it's not like, I'm like, I don't, I'm not jealous.
2162200	2168520	I'm not, it's just like, it's, it's very frustrating because you don't know, like, you would say, okay, well, what is the algorithm looking for?
2168560	2171320	Like, I will do that thing, but you don't know.
2171320	2172320	And nobody knows.
2172320	2179040	It's like, you just keep trying things and see what sticks, but I'm telling you what it's looking for is short content.
2179040	2180200	That's going to be what gets you.
2180200	2188080	I mean, I'm not saying specifically for the YouTube algorithm, but like short content and leveraging that to the places like YouTube shorts, TikTok.
2188120	2194640	And that sort of thing that will, and honestly, we need to take our own fucking advice and put clips of this show on those platforms as well.
2194640	2198040	You know, we haven't, technically we have a vog network TikTok.
2198040	2199280	We just haven't used it yet.
2199280	2200120	Keyword yet.
2200480	2202640	Um, but it's there, you can go follow it.
2202920	2214320	Um, but, uh, you know, I, I really think that's the secret because my opinion is when it comes to 20 minute YouTube videos, you're going to watch the things that you already know you like.
2214560	2219520	When it comes to minute and a half shorts, you're more willing to sit there and watch random things that are put in front of you.
2219520	2220520	Cause you're just binging them.
2220760	2224560	I think that's a real key difference, but right anyway.
2224600	2229360	But yeah, and, and, and it depends, like it just like the type type of content.
2229360	2236520	Some people don't really want to watch us in peace right now, but then there's also some people that will watch the same thing over and over or the same person over and over.
2237120	2239120	There's, there's something for everyone.
2239160	2239840	There's nothing for everyone.
2239840	2240000	Yeah.
2240000	2248800	It's just, it's, it's all about tricking the algorithm to get it to the most impressions and you'll, it's just a percentage game at that point.
2250080	2250440	All right.
2250480	2254360	Uh, my gaming week, not, not terribly exciting compared to previous weeks.
2254360	2257040	I, I still am on my Warcraft bullshit.
2257080	2262080	I got to level 64, uh, on my orc priest, which by the way is a new combination.
2262080	2264200	Orcs couldn't be priests before this expansion.
2264200	2268800	So, or I should say my priestess, uh, cause I'm a lady orc, uh, named super Sprode.
2268800	2271240	One of my favorite freeze pop songs there ever was.
2271280	2275560	So, um, I actually, I recycled an old rogue or something just to steal the name.
2275920	2284480	So, um, yeah, I, I've still been on that and that's been fun cause I've been in the new expansion areas, which are, it's, it's, it's weird cause they're very vertical.
2284480	2292680	They're very flying, uh, based, which they came up with a new form of flying for this, the dragon, which is the name of the expansion dragon flight.
2292880	2293640	So it's interesting.
2293640	2298320	It took me a minute to warm up to it, but now that I've warmed up to it, I'm like, I kind of like it for being able to explore.
2298320	2303920	I think it's a good medium between they don't want you to just fly around in the zone and finish all the quests instantly.
2303960	2310480	And, uh, you know, have a sense of you're not wasting time walking everywhere.
2310480	2311120	It's interesting.
2311720	2322280	Um, other games I've been continuing on, uh, my, uh, AR gaming stuff, specifically Pokemon go had a two day community day this weekend and I had some shinies to catch up on.
2322320	2325720	So I went pretty hard at least yesterday.
2326000	2332400	I walked 10,000 steps today was harder because I knew I had OLR at six o'clock, so I couldn't stay out.
2332720	2335320	Um, but I think I got like four or five shinies today.
2335320	2336840	I got a lot more yesterday.
2337240	2340000	I, I think I still don't have a shiny Litwick.
2340520	2344800	I think that was, I couldn't do that community day for some reason.
2344800	2352240	I still don't have a shiny Litwick, so I'm going to have to beg somebody else for one that got like 40 of them, but I think I filled in the other shinies I needed.
2352600	2359160	Um, Starly, I remember was one, I think that was when I had COVID was Starly day and I was able to get a couple of those today.
2359160	2360440	So I feel better about that now.
2361360	2366320	Uh, and then I've also been playing Pikmin Bloom had some very controversial changes this week.
2366360	2373640	I'm not going to go too into the weeds cause I know not a ton of people play Pikmin Bloom, but I've really enjoyed it as far as like a passive type of experience.
2373920	2376960	They changed the mushroom combat system though.
2376960	2381040	And they, they really did not make popular changes.
2381040	2387200	I get what they were going for, but they made battles that used to take five minutes, take seven days.
2387240	2389720	That's not an exaggeration, literally seven.
2389720	2391400	It's a complete change to the system.
2391800	2399200	I get why they were doing it because they were trying to encourage people to get to see each other actually battling together and stuff like that.
2399400	2401680	But they went a little too hard to the extreme.
2402040	2411640	On the plus side, the team heard the feedback within two days and cut down all the times by either 50% or 75%, depending on the level of mushroom.
2411640	2413080	And I think it's much more reasonable now.
2413520	2417560	Um, so I think, I think Pikmin Bloom's in an interesting place right now.
2417880	2423760	Um, I'm, I'm still enjoying it, but I also think there's some nuances with the system they need to do.
2423760	2434800	Like they need to have a way where you are required to drop a certain amount of Pikmin in there because it's too easy to exploit the system and just drop one Pikmin in there.
2435040	2438560	And then, but you're also robbing yourself of leveling up Pikmin that way.
2438560	2438920	I don't know.
2438920	2440040	It's, it's just a weird thing.
2440400	2445360	Uh, and then if five people are on a mushroom, that mushroom needs to phase out and a new one brought in.
2445360	2453120	So five more people can jump on it because it's making play for the game in some places like Tokyo, I hear like impossible because people jump on a mushroom.
2453360	2454600	And then nobody else could do it.
2454760	2456640	So anyway, there's still some little nuances.
2456640	2461960	I'm not going to go too deep in the weeds because I know not a lot of people play Pikmin Bloom, but, um, I, I do.
2461960	2471080	And I, I still like it as a walking incentivizer and I'm still level 69, but I'm only like 15,000 steps away from level 70.
2471080	2473960	So sadly, I won't get to say that too much longer.
2474600	2477000	Um, what else have I played?
2477040	2478920	Oh, I played an interesting thing today.
2479440	2482600	Uh, cause I saw Alan playing it and I was like, oh, I forgot this is a thing.
2482600	2483560	Oh, this is free.
2483560	2484640	If I already own the game.
2484640	2485280	Okay, cool.
2485280	2485840	I'll do this.
2486120	2496200	So I got portal for RTX, the new version of portal that they released with like the souped up graphics because I was like, I have a fancy new computer with a fancy new graphics card.
2496200	2496800	Let me try this.
2497800	2511160	It doesn't run great in 4k, but on Alan's machine he has, so Alan actually has a really nice monitor, but it only runs ultra HD or 2k, but it's a really like pretty finished.
2511160	2512760	Like it has that slight curve to it.
2512760	2513720	It's really bright.
2513880	2515440	I've watched him play Fortnite on it.
2515440	2516280	It looks really good.
2516280	2529760	And I watched him play the portal RTX game and it looked pretty good, but, um, he got a much better frame rate than I did because mine's in 4k and it's, it's kind of ugly and his is in 2k and it runs pretty decently.
2530080	2532960	So that was, but it was, it's really nice to look at.
2533000	2539800	I played like the first couple of stages and I was like, okay, I didn't, it isn't worth it to have the nicer graphics.
2539800	2546920	But is it, isn't it nice to feel like my very expensive investment is already outdated by that game?
2547160	2548840	My very expensive investment.
2549560	2551040	It's not just that game.
2551040	2557200	It's a lot of games are ray tracing is still not optimized well enough for even like modern cards.
2557200	2561960	Like even like on a 40 90, I think with that game, it doesn't run great.
2562520	2563440	It's just the game.
2564320	2564680	Fair.
2565200	2567240	So, and a lot of games, it's a lot of games.
2567240	2568960	It seems like ray tracing was just not worth it.
2569080	2569360	Yeah.
2570280	2570840	It's not.
2571520	2574600	Um, the only other thing I touched this week was Tetris effect connected.
2575360	2578760	Because I've been going into the Epic store every day to get the free game.
2578800	2583440	Cause you know, they started their, whatever, 15 days of holiday downloads, whatever it is.
2583760	2586640	Cause they, they had horizon chase turbo yesterday, which is a pretty good one.
2586960	2598280	Um, and usually the December 25th one, I think, and the, um, very last one are usually like they gave away the entire Tomb Raider trilogy last year, if I remember right.
2598320	2602360	So I'm hoping there'll be a big one that I don't have yet that they'll give away.
2602640	2609520	Um, but I was bringing up the Epic store and I was like, Oh, I don't think I've played Tetris effect since I got this newer computer and the 4k monitor and everything.
2609880	2610840	It was very pretty.
2610920	2611920	I was, I was very happy.
2611920	2612600	I fired that up.
2612600	2615400	I was like, Oh, this is, this is nice comfort food.
2615440	2617760	As far as game goes, I love some Tetris effect.
2618040	2620240	I, I really hope there's another one.
2620480	2625440	We haven't really heard about what, um, Mizuguchi is working on now.
2625440	2626080	Have we?
2626760	2630080	So he's kind of, I would assume he's working on another Tetris effect game.
2630080	2632680	Like the last one was huge, but I don't know.
2632680	2634920	I guess nothing's for sure in that department.
2634920	2635400	Who knows?
2635800	2637040	So, all right.
2637640	2639760	Otherwise that was pretty much my gaming week.
2640160	2644040	So we will move on and let's get into some news from the week.
2644080	2646160	Loki, what's going on in video game news.
2646840	2647960	You must finally do it.
2648120	2651120	He's going to make a movie about death Stranding.
2651720	2654560	And it's going to have a different story, which is interesting.
2654560	2658480	It's going to be set around a different set of characters, but still in the same universe.
2658880	2662400	And that's good because I don't understand what the hell's going on in Death Stranding.
2662400	2665560	So it'll be, it'll be nice when they dumb it down.
2665640	2668400	You actually have to play the game to understand a little bit, at least.
2669000	2671240	I mean, that is true that that would probably help.
2671240	2671720	It would help.
2672920	2678000	But yes, so he's finally going to be working on a movie in partnership
2678000	2681760	with Kajima Productions and barbarian executive producer,
2682160	2687440	Alex Leibovitchis, Hammerstone Studios.
2689240	2691280	Didn't really go into much detail there.
2691280	2693280	Then it's going to have new elements and characters.
2694320	2696400	Basically saying we're thrilled and honored to have an opportunity
2696400	2701080	to partner with the brilliant and iconic Hideo Kojima in his first film adaptation.
2701080	2704000	Unlike other big budget tentpole video game adaptions,
2704320	2707280	this will be something far more intimate and grounded.
2707280	2710640	Our I'm sorry, the game is not grounded at all.
2711240	2715560	Our goal is to redefine what video game adaptations could be
2716240	2718080	when you have the creative and artistic freedom.
2718080	2720960	This will be a film that's authentic Hideo Kojima production.
2720960	2722160	It's going to be insane.
2722160	2724240	He's not going to be able to make a two and a half hour movie.
2724240	2725880	He's not. He's he's not.
2725880	2728400	It's going to be like, oh, we had to split it into two movies.
2728840	2731280	Like, there's no way. No way.
2732680	2733800	I will go see it.
2733800	2736240	It's going to because it's going to be crazy.
2736240	2738640	Zen Monkey Eleven says, give me the release date of that movie
2738640	2740760	so I can plan to do something else that weekend.
2740760	2742520	Well, who's to say it's going to be in theaters?
2742520	2746600	I mean, I I honestly think the movie is going to be so long.
2746600	2750880	He ends up doing Netflix, Hulu, HBO, whatever it is show.
2751840	2755480	So I think it ends up becoming a series, to be quite honest.
2755480	2757840	But we'll see. We'll see. Who knows?
2757840	2761480	So Tiger on chat says they need to get Norman Reedus involved.
2762160	2764160	Well, he's going to be in the sequel.
2764200	2767720	So and I wonder if this doesn't tie into this because the sequel,
2767720	2770480	I don't see how it can be.
2770480	2771440	I mean, I don't know.
2771440	2774000	There's a lot of weird places they could go with the sequel,
2774000	2776680	but they're obviously putting Norman Reedus in it.
2776680	2779400	So it's interesting.
2779440	2782600	Yeah. Well, let's see, I guess. Yeah.
2782640	2785560	Let's see. Fifth Dream says the movie will be generated in engine
2785560	2788040	and cost seventy dollars to play on PlayStation five.
2788040	2790920	I don't know if you can screen it at the cinema if it does that.
2790920	2793800	Who knows? As Joan Hunter Matt says, yeah, he can't fit it
2793800	2795080	in a two to three hour movie.
2795080	2797960	I feel like a Death Stranding series would have been good on HBO Max.
2798160	2799080	But let's be real.
2799080	2801160	But WB Discovery isn't making that happen.
2801160	2803160	No, that's that's true. How about Disney Plus?
2804800	2808560	How about Death Stranding on Disney Plus?
2808560	2811560	All right, let's move on.
2812120	2817240	Let's talk about what I mentioned Tomb Raider during the epic game store
2817480	2821960	giveaways and Tomb Raider is going to be continuing.
2822040	2825040	You know, we haven't we haven't heard a lot out of the series in a little bit,
2825040	2828400	and that's likely because they are going to start a new trilogy
2828400	2829800	or do something new with it.
2829800	2833000	But it has been confirmed that Crystal Dynamics is working on
2833000	2836440	Lara Croft's biggest and most expansive adventure yet
2837000	2839040	because it's being built in Unreal Engine five.
2839040	2840880	Oh, that was something they had said before.
2840880	2842440	They're making it in Unreal Engine five.
2842440	2844720	I do remember that when they announced Unreal Engine.
2845000	2848560	But now what we've learned is that Amazon is going to be publishing it.
2849080	2851080	So Crystal Dynamics is developing.
2851120	2854320	Amazon is publishing and Unreal Engine five is being used.
2854680	2858880	It's still a few years out, but it is going to come to multiple platforms.
2859240	2863080	Amazon does say it will have all of the franchise's hallmarks.
2863480	2867400	So I'm assuming that means the elaborate death scenes
2867400	2870280	that are a part of Lara Croft's no good, very bad day.
2870600	2875240	I'm assuming we're going to still see some of that in the game. We'll see.
2876760	2879000	It's it's not going to be a remake either.
2879000	2881720	So it's continuing Laura's story as well.
2881720	2883200	It's not a new reboot.
2883200	2888120	So I guess it's not really a new trilogy, but maybe a continuation trilogy.
2888120	2891520	I guess I guess it's the Scream four or the Scream five,
2891520	2896280	even of the Lara Croft Tomb Raider recent games. I don't know.
2897280	2899920	But anyway, even though Embracer
2899920	2902720	got the intellectual property rights to Tomb Raider and so forth,
2903200	2907520	this is just, you know, Crystal Dynamics has made the agreement with Amazon
2907520	2911240	for this. In a statement, the head of the studio, Scott Amos, said,
2911480	2914560	Crystal Dynamics has an extraordinary opportunity following our acquisition
2914560	2917760	by Embracer to redefine what a publishing relationship is for Tomb Raider.
2918000	2919720	Transformative is what we're looking for.
2919720	2922880	And with Amazon Games, we found a team that shares our creative vision,
2923200	2926560	ambitions and values for a Lara Croft universe across the spectrum
2926560	2927720	of possibilities.
2927720	2930720	They're uniquely positioned to rewrite what publishing and development
2930720	2934440	collaborations are, and we're eager to forge this new path together,
2934600	2938320	starting with building the biggest and best Tomb Raider game yet.
2939480	2941560	And of course, we know that's all the fluff speak.
2941880	2944880	We need to see what the game really looks like to be convinced.
2945160	2946920	Although, you know,
2946920	2950320	Amazon's got a cloud service that you probably forgot about.
2950440	2952520	They have their Luna services out there.
2953000	2957040	Wouldn't it be a smart thing for them to do if they were to put like the demo?
2957040	2958800	I'm not saying they have to release the game on Luna.
2958800	2960120	I mean, they should.
2960120	2962960	But even just put the demo.
2963440	2967760	If you want people just just to check out Luna, put the first demo
2967960	2971400	on the cloud service for just like a couple of days before you put on PS
2971400	2972600	fires, I'm telling you,
2972600	2975840	people will check out Luna just to fire up that demo and play it.
2975840	2978160	I think I think that would be a smart idea.
2978160	2979840	But I've also said on a previous episode,
2979840	2982720	I believe Amazon to be an extremely siloed company right now.
2982720	2984160	So I'm not expecting it to happen.
2984160	2987160	It's just, you know, what I what I need them to get dead by daylight.
2987720	2989560	Oh, yes, right. Luna doesn't have that, huh?
2989560	2990960	So that was so that way.
2990960	2992520	I won't have to use.
2992520	2996000	I mean, this story is great, just not the most stable of connections.
2997320	3001040	Yeah. And, you know, you would think that Amazon has a good relationship
3001040	3004840	with behavior because you see all the giveaways and Amazon Prime gaming
3004840	3006200	or whatever it's called,
3006200	3009320	which, again, why that is completely separate from Luna.
3009320	3011160	I don't understand.
3011160	3012840	But Amazon is siloed clearly.
3012840	3014480	So it's just weird.
3014480	3016840	So anyway.
3017560	3020360	Fifth Dream in chat says, is anything an Unreal Engine
3020360	3022440	five besides homebrew demos?
3022720	3023880	Give it a little more time.
3023880	3026520	You know, it takes a couple of years to make a triple A game.
3026680	3029760	And that's why you're seeing the small stuffs coming out relatively fast.
3029760	3031360	The things don't need a couple of years,
3031360	3033560	but it's going to take a couple of years in the oven
3033560	3035640	until you start seeing the fruits of this.
3035640	3037320	You know, things like Tomb Raider and so forth.
3037320	3039360	And I'm going to guess.
3040760	3043720	They're going to need to be able to get away from the Xbox S.
3044680	3047840	To do this, I think the Xbox S and let's be real, the PlayStation
3047840	3051120	four are also kind of holding because right now
3052080	3056600	most games still release on like PlayStation four.
3056600	3060200	And pretty much Microsoft has a mandate that everything that they release on
3060200	3062080	X has to release on S.
3062080	3065280	And I think there's going to come a time when that gets separated,
3065280	3069840	probably whenever Microsoft releases a Y or a Z or whatever they call it.
3069840	3070440	I don't know.
3070440	3074360	But they're probably going to stop supporting the S in the same way
3074360	3075280	at that point.
3075320	3078000	Now, for those of you that own an S,
3078000	3081920	I don't think you'll be screwed because enter Microsoft's
3081920	3085640	cloud will absolutely be functional on the S.
3085640	3088600	And that's how they'll continue to let you play a lot of those games.
3088600	3090560	That's you know, they haven't said anything.
3090560	3092440	That's just, you know.
3093120	3094400	Fortune teller Rob here,
3094400	3097000	but I don't see how they don't do that for the future.
3097520	3098520	We'll see.
3098520	3101240	Dartesuya also points out they had the Matrix Universe demo.
3101240	3104520	Yeah, that was the big showy offy thing for Unreal Engine five, for sure.
3105000	3108440	Dijirama says, I legit think that Microsoft could update the firmware
3108440	3111040	to handle 4K on the Xbox Series S.
3111640	3114360	Maybe, but is it going to run like Portal RTX?
3114960	3116720	Because then maybe don't.
3116720	3118280	Maybe don't.
3118880	3120840	But maybe give people the option.
3120840	3122360	They have the option on a PC game.
3122360	3124240	Give people the option.
3124240	3126360	No, I like that idea.
3126360	3129320	All right, moving on, Dark Sakura.
3129320	3133360	So I'm sure anyone who's been following
3133760	3136560	what I've been playing recently knows I've been playing Final Fantasy five
3136560	3138920	and I am not playing the Pixel remasters.
3138920	3142240	But certainly a good number of my friends have been playing the Pixel remasters.
3142240	3146880	Like I know Le Pen was playing through the Final Fantasy games.
3147280	3151160	And there will be a limited standard
3151160	3155560	and then a 35th anniversary special edition
3156680	3160600	Final Fantasy Pixel remaster, which is one through six.
3161160	3164480	And the anniversary edition actually looks pretty stellar.
3164480	3167840	It's coming to PS4 and Switch in 2023.
3169920	3172400	This comes with a bunch of shit. It's awesome. I kind of want it.
3174040	3177640	It is going to be for the standard is $74.99
3177880	3180680	and that's a Squenix store exclusive.
3181120	3187160	And then the the big anniversary bundle, also an exclusive, is $259.99.
3187560	3192160	Now, the standard comes with the one through six Pixel remaster collection,
3192160	3196560	which is a physical copy of all the games for PS4 or Switch.
3197040	3202160	And then the the really super deluxe, awesome version
3203000	3207160	has the physical copies again, anniversary edition, a goodie box,
3208200	3211360	a bonus lenticular sleeve for the game package,
3212200	3216520	a two disc vinyl record set with arranged game music
3216520	3220600	and the cover artwork done by Shibuya Kazuko.
3225320	3228120	Compiled art books showing the pixel art
3229000	3234880	and then eight pixel art style characters in window packaging.
3237520	3241200	It's looking pretty, pretty hardcore epic.
3241800	3244360	That's a lot of a lot of good stuff that comes with that.
3244800	3248000	Um, the pins are also like super cute.
3248000	3251840	You've got like your your white mage and your black mage
3251840	3254200	and you've got some characters from the other games.
3254200	3256120	You got your fighter and all of that.
3256120	3258280	And it's looking it's looking pretty nice.
3258600	3261000	I think I could I think it's already gone.
3261320	3262880	I think that is it.
3262880	3266360	Yeah, because I know the pre-order the sorry, the orders just started.
3266360	3268880	Yeah, no, Shane is complaining in chat.
3269120	3272160	Shadley Lin's in our chat saying, putting the physical copies
3272160	3274760	up in the middle of the night, charging twenty five bucks for shipping
3274760	3278240	and making them only available through their online store is just garbage.
3278280	3282040	Screw Square Enix for how they're handling the pixel remasters for consoles.
3282400	3286840	So and Dark Tetsuya says, I'm seriously hoping for individual digital releases.
3286840	3289520	I hope it's not exclusive to this limited physical edition.
3289520	3293280	Oh, I don't square would literally be leaving money on the table.
3293280	3295560	They have to have a digital option somewhere.
3295560	3298920	I would be I would be flabbergasted.
3299800	3300960	You're not buying it?
3301000	3302240	No, I have the original.
3302240	3304840	Why would I want the remasters?
3305960	3307360	They're cute, I don't know.
3307360	3309520	I understand they're a little pricey.
3309520	3312760	I don't think I would pay this high ticket price for all the collectors stuff
3312760	3315240	for them, but I enjoyed the four remaster.
3315480	3320680	I have so many copies of four on different items.
3321120	3325280	And then I have like the PlayStation collection
3325280	3327360	and I have the cartridges for everything,
3328360	3332080	not to mention, you know, other ways of playing them.
3332080	3337800	I don't see the pixel remasters would be like if someone had no access
3337800	3340680	to the original cartridges and wanted to play something
3340680	3342800	that looks kind of like the original did.
3343240	3346000	Also, the high risk pixels kind of freak me out.
3346000	3348760	I need I need them to be old school.
3349160	3350440	I need my old pixels.
3350440	3353280	I will say this, especially if they do piecemeal them.
3353280	3354640	I think you could make a case.
3354640	3356600	Well, there's no right or wrong answer.
3356600	3358400	Every gamer makes their own choice of their purchases.
3358400	3363200	But I think there could be a stronger case for specifically Final Fantasy three.
3363800	3365840	And Jason kind of referenced in the intro there tonight
3365840	3369480	that technically Final Fantasy three has never been released in the U.S.
3369880	3371800	in two dimensions.
3371800	3374120	The very first time we got Final Fantasy three was that
3375920	3377600	3D DS.
3377600	3380960	Well, there was the it was DS first, and then the iOS version came after that.
3380960	3383920	And so we've only ever really had it in its 3D form.
3384240	3386320	It was even on the Ouya in the 3D form.
3386320	3388840	Remember that that was a big deal because Square Enix put something on the Ouya.
3389120	3390040	It was Final Fantasy three.
3390040	3392800	So this is the first time we've had it in two dimensions.
3393080	3396240	And that means the first time with an official English translation.
3396240	3397600	Anyway, in two dimensions.
3397600	3402200	So I would say that one in particular, I think has the strongest case going for it.
3402200	3406320	Because I if you don't really care for the 3D ones, I don't I
3406920	3408760	I don't know. I could kind of give or take them.
3408760	3412040	I understand the perks for Final Fantasy four in the 3D.
3412040	3413600	And some people were really into it.
3413600	3417640	I still think the best version of Final Fantasy four was the one they did on the PSP.
3417960	3419480	Was it the PS Vita?
3419480	3421960	It was what it was the PSP.
3421960	3423480	The best one is the original.
3423480	3426320	Yeah, that's everyone's entitled to their opinion.
3427000	3428720	But I love the one on the PSP.
3428720	3430840	So if you ones are good.
3430840	3435240	But I guess but I also understand the originals absolutely have their charm,
3435600	3439600	especially, you know, when you compare the Japanese original original
3439600	3442760	to what they actually released in the US, which was, you know,
3442760	3445200	Final Fantasy, easy mode,
3445200	3448400	which is all I ever knew for years through the Japanese one.
3448480	3452000	Yeah. Yeah. When I did my thing, just it was a translated
3453160	3455280	Japanese rom.
3455280	3458320	And it had like all the censorship fixed and everything.
3458320	3461560	And the original dialogue is closely translated as possible.
3461920	3465760	Like the spoonie Bard line was more like you son of a bitch.
3466520	3469840	Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it was a lot harsher.
3470520	3474400	Um, as to show 100, Matt says there's a rumor they're going to fix the font
3474400	3476280	in these versions for Switch and PS4.
3476280	3480280	That is the by far and wide, the biggest problem with the pixel remasters
3480280	3482520	is the font sucks.
3482520	3485040	It's going to especially suck on a large TV
3485040	3486640	if you're sitting on the in the back of the room.
3486640	3489800	So I do hope that is true, that they're looking at redoing those fonts.
3489800	3492000	I really I really hope that's more than just a rumor.
3492160	3494840	But that's probably at the top of people's wish list there.
3495040	3497160	And going into chat for some other comments.
3497440	3500800	Shadley Lynn Shane says the regular edition is gone.
3501000	3505040	The collector's edition is still up for like 260 before shipping.
3505080	3507160	Yeah, no, I'm not paying that.
3507160	3508800	That's what I said.
3508800	3510560	No, I just I'm not.
3510560	3513040	It's too much, too much.
3513040	3516360	But I mean, it's a lot of cool crap, but it's yeah, I don't need it.
3518800	3522400	Shadley Lynn also says, I just want a physical cart for the switch for them.
3522400	3524440	And that's true, and Matt says same.
3524440	3526920	I think I might get the PlayStation version. I don't know.
3526920	3528760	I kind of I kind of love trophies.
3528760	3531720	I don't know. I just I that's kind of what I want.
3531720	3534040	I don't. But I also don't do a lot of portable gaming.
3534040	3537520	And I know some of you all do a lot more gaming on the go.
3537520	3540720	Even the switch stuff I end up playing on my monitor or my TV.
3540720	3543200	So it's, you know, whatever.
3543200	3545280	But I'm glad they're finally coming.
3545280	3547200	It took them long enough to announce this.
3547200	3549600	I really would have thought this would have been like a year ago.
3549600	3551720	So it's about time, I guess.
3552640	3554640	All right. Moving on, Loki.
3555640	3560440	All right, well, Epic is shutting down some older game servers
3560440	3563240	for games you may recognize.
3563240	3566800	Many, unfortunately, happen to be harmonics games.
3567280	3571840	So we have that central one, two and three
3573040	3578080	are all being shut down as well as numerous rock band games.
3578080	3581320	So we have Green Day, rock band, rock band one, two and three.
3582200	3585400	The Beatles rock band all being shut down.
3585400	3589880	And then, of course, with unreal gold, unreal to the awakening,
3589880	3593800	unreal tournament 2003, 2004 and unreal tournament three
3594320	3598040	and unreal tournament game of the year edition as well.
3598040	3600480	And then there's some other random ones there and their supersonic
3601080	3603560	acrobatic rocket powered battle cars.
3604240	3608000	Great name. Monsters probably stole my princess
3608000	3611080	as well being shut down and 1000 tiny claws.
3611080	3612840	Those are all being shut down, though.
3612840	3615880	January 24th of 2023.
3616160	3618800	So play online while you can.
3619640	3621880	Rock band four is going to still be online, though.
3622320	3625400	And the dance central VR
3625400	3628320	online multiplayer will remain available for now.
3628320	3630800	I didn't even know that dance central VR was a thing.
3631800	3632840	I did not either.
3632840	3637080	Now to be on like it's it's sad to hear that these are going offline.
3637160	3640680	But to be honest, I kind of assume they already were like.
3640680	3643280	I thought they had the servers for Rock Band two and three,
3643280	3645440	like not long after four is released.
3645440	3648320	So I was like, oh, they're even still up and running.
3648960	3651960	That's cool. But yeah, it's still it's still hits
3651960	3655120	in the end of the end of an era type of way, I suppose.
3655120	3657600	Yeah. And there are a few more things, too.
3657600	3663000	So also, apparently players are going to lose access
3663000	3666120	to the following titles on their removal dates as well.
3666440	3669600	Battle Breakers is going to be removed December 30th,
3669640	3672680	and they're going to refund players for any in-game purchases
3672680	3677360	made via epic direct payments 108 days prior to today.
3678040	3682080	Unreal Tournament Alpha is being shut down January 24th.
3682080	3687360	Rock Band Blitz on January 24th and the Rock Band companion app.
3687360	3691280	Also January 24th in sync space on January 24th.
3691280	3693480	Man, I wish Rock Band Blitz would come back.
3693600	3695680	Such a good game. It's a bummer.
3696680	3698600	Um, let's see.
3698600	3701240	S200 Matt says keeping the servers going for 20 years
3701240	3703640	on some of those unreal games is pretty generous, to be honest.
3703920	3705520	I'm kind of bummed and also surprised.
3705520	3706920	Unreal Tournament 2004.
3706920	3709240	That was my big multiplayer game in my college years.
3709440	3712280	What I'm surprised most about is that the servers were still running.
3712320	3713440	Yeah, this is kind of kind of.
3713440	3717240	Yeah. Oh, and they also this was probably impacts Jamie a little more,
3717240	3721640	but they apparently have removed the Mac
3721680	3723440	and Linux versions
3723440	3727600	of Hot Tofo Boyfriend and Hot Tofo Boyfriend Holiday Star.
3728840	3731040	I wonder why. That's weird.
3731040	3733280	No idea. They're old-ass games.
3733320	3735360	It's already, um,
3735360	3738960	compatibility for the first one for Mac and iOS have already been removed.
3739720	3741440	But I think they're still on Steam, though.
3741440	3744320	I think this is like epic, epic direct or something like that.
3744320	3746880	So maybe. Interesting. They are.
3747800	3750120	Speaking of harmonics, a reminder.
3750120	3754000	We kind of mentioned it in the parody bump, but that isn't on the podcast.
3754000	3756720	And I don't know, it might be too late by the time the podcast is out.
3756720	3761320	But reminder, Fusor's gone tomorrow, December 19th, which is Monday.
3761320	3763720	So and I don't know what time of day it gets pulled.
3764440	3767560	So it is I noticed it was 1999 on Steam.
3767560	3771000	And if you do own Fusor and you haven't done it yet
3771000	3774400	and you're listening live, do it now, because you'll forget otherwise.
3774400	3778560	Open the game and get the packs in the game that are like it's
3778600	3780960	it's the unlock everything for free.
3781400	3785760	So it unlocks every I don't think it unlocks the DLC songs, unfortunately.
3785920	3788520	But I think as far as like cosmetics, outfits, things like that,
3788520	3791480	somebody in chat can correct me if I'm wrong, but I was seeing
3791480	3795080	that was going around is that they have like a everything pack that's free.
3795080	3798760	And I think as far as, you know, again, like in in-game items
3798760	3802160	and that sort of thing, that's what they're giving away for free.
3802160	3805160	And you will not be able to access it after tomorrow because the store will be gone.
3805480	3810360	So just a reminder on that front, for those of you that own the game Fusor,
3810360	3813600	even if you think you'll never play it again, grab them just in case.
3813600	3815400	I think it's a good idea.
3815400	3817880	So, yeah, Zen Monkey 11 in chat says,
3818080	3821080	This is why I don't like to buy games with an online expiration date.
3821320	3823040	The refund thing is a great idea.
3823040	3828320	Well, the only the only time I think we've seen refunds is Stadia.
3829160	3830960	And Dark Soccer can attest to that.
3830960	3833080	And I think that's a that's a rarity.
3833120	3836360	Be honest, is a nice little rarity there.
3836880	3839320	It farted rainbows all over my bank account. Mm hmm.
3840680	3845160	Shane says it unlocks the the Fusor unlocks the diamond stuff,
3845400	3847640	which was on a rotation, I believe weekly.
3847640	3851040	It does include songs, but they are harmonics artist songs.
3851040	3853800	So, yeah, there's a there's a variety of free DLC
3854000	3857240	also in Steam, which I'm imagining is the same stuff.
3857440	3862280	So, yeah, I would grab everything you can before tomorrow's the end of Fusor.
3862280	3864840	So those that enjoyed that.
3864840	3869160	All right, let's move on and talk about this next story,
3869160	3871640	which has to do with Armored Core six,
3871840	3874760	which turned a lot of heads when it was announced at the Game Awards.
3875240	3878320	Armored Core six will have versus multiplayer.
3878560	3882400	I don't know if you're excited about that, Loki, but I know you're a fan of Max.
3882400	3886920	And yeah, well, and I'm excited about this and what what it you know,
3886920	3892240	what it won't have is souls like gameplay that is being confirmed as well.
3892240	3894520	So it's, you know, a different series,
3894520	3897680	even though from software is no one of the stuff, though, I think.
3898280	3899200	I don't know about that.
3899200	3902600	But anyway, IGN had an interview with Yamamura,
3903160	3906880	who is the I believe the executive producer of the game.
3907520	3911640	He's saying, yes, we do plan to have a versus mode similar to previous
3911640	3914000	armed core titles where you'll be able to customize your mech
3914160	3917000	and take that fully customized mech into battle with others.
3917240	3920520	But we will reveal more details about this at a later date.
3921080	3924800	But also being said, story mode is the priority for this
3925920	3927400	versus is going to be a separate thing.
3927400	3930760	Multiplayer will not be part of the story.
3931120	3934840	So even though in armor, excuse me, armored core five,
3935200	3938960	there were more multiplayer options, such as teams of 20
3939200	3941400	facing off to defend and take territory.
3941400	3943360	So we'll see what comes of that.
3943360	3946560	Twenty twenty three is the anticipated release of armored core six fires
3946600	3949960	of Rubicon, PS4, PS5, Xbox series
3950600	3954320	and Xbox one even and PC via steam.
3955280	3959240	The last release was 2012 was armored cord five.
3959240	3962440	So it's been some time if you weren't aware for these games.
3963800	3965800	All right, let's move on.
3965800	3969120	I think we're to Dark Sakura.
3969120	3971880	Believe that we are.
3972360	3975320	And this is
3977160	3978600	I think a long time coming.
3978600	3982000	Well, by a long time, I mean things that people have really pushed for.
3983200	3987640	Twitch had basically added in a bunch of charities
3988080	3991520	that were based off of items
3991520	3995480	approved by PayPal Giving Fund.
3996160	4001720	And among them was one called the LGB Alliance, which for
4001840	4006280	for all even what its name implies, it is actually an anti trans
4006320	4007480	hate group.
4008600	4014280	And so with a lot of push from other Twitch users and a big
4014920	4019480	just upvote on one of their remove hate group
4019720	4023400	forum posts that received over 16000 upvotes,
4024440	4027800	Twitch said that they removed it and they're quoted with this.
4028440	4032000	Twitch does not allow charities that violate our hateful conduct policies
4032000	4036040	on Twitch, whose organization and leadership engage
4036040	4041320	in or promote behaviors that violate our office service policy.
4041600	4044760	Inclusion on this list is not an endorsement from Twitch.
4046160	4050320	Also, it says, however, we regularly review the list
4050680	4054680	and remove organizations that violate our policies.
4055880	4058480	There are still a few over there,
4059440	4063600	and it's pretty clear there's not like a true vetting process for any of these.
4063600	4066920	I think it's just a mass approval, again, based on whatever
4066920	4069160	PayPal Giving approves.
4069760	4073920	But at the very least, it's it's a response.
4073960	4076680	Maybe they'll they'll take it to heart more for the future.
4077680	4080320	Yeah. And if I believe correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe
4080320	4083680	LGB Alliance is more based in the UK as well.
4083680	4087000	I only heard of it when I was on Twitter and I'm not there anymore.
4087000	4090360	But I also know that Lady Voldemort probably was involved with that somehow,
4090360	4092800	because you know how she is, unfortunately.
4092840	4096040	And it's just it's obviously like as somebody who is G,
4096400	4100360	it's just really gross that you would not support RT,
4100360	4104320	you know, brothers and sisters and siblings, because like it's
4104680	4105600	we're all in it together.
4105600	4108320	And it's just I do not understand that mentality whatsoever.
4108320	4109480	And it's really gross.
4109480	4111480	Well, divided will fall. Yeah, right.
4111480	4113480	It's really gross with the organization pushes.
4113480	4117520	So it's just, you know, I used to see some of that crap on Twitter
4117520	4121360	just because, you know, usually it was, quote, tweets of people dragging them
4121400	4124040	and the other things like that, which, you know, you're still amplifying it.
4124040	4124920	So I wish you wouldn't do that.
4124920	4127240	But, you know, it's
4128720	4131320	I just hope nobody I know would be involved with something like that,
4131320	4135720	because we're we're, you know, trans men are men and trans women are women.
4135720	4136800	And we're all in this together.
4136800	4140440	And it's just, yeah, it's and and being
4141320	4144200	non-binary is a true thing, of course. Yeah.
4144480	4148560	So, yeah, you you are who you are, be your true self.
4148560	4153120	And if anybody says that that you're not valid, kick him in the shin really hard.
4154120	4156840	Agree. All right.
4156840	4160680	I don't normally advocate for violence, but you see how that feels.
4160720	4162080	That's how I feel emotionally.
4162080	4164480	So shut the fuck up, sit down and drink your goddamn tea.
4164480	4167280	You know what? I bet Argentina kicked a lot of shins today.
4167280	4170280	So you know what?
4170280	4172760	It is what it is. All right.
4172760	4175240	Moving on, let's get into it.
4175240	4178320	And that was that was a soccer joke or a football joke for the rest of the world.
4178320	4181520	OK, I quoted Sid from Final Fantasy seven. All right.
4182440	4183880	Moving on. Where are we at?
4183880	4189360	Loki. So Guerrilla Games has confirmed that they are working on an online
4190280	4193880	adaptation or online project in the Horizon universe.
4194400	4197120	It's being worked on.
4197160	4200680	I guess they are advertising open positions
4200720	4203480	in their Amsterdam office.
4204040	4208240	And yeah, it says we're looking for talented people for Horizon single player.
4208800	4212200	Online project and external project teams.
4213080	4216120	So no word on what that is yet, but
4216760	4219120	maybe another live service game.
4221240	4223960	Yay. Oh, boy.
4225280	4227680	We'll have to see, I guess.
4227680	4229920	But it's there's there's something coming.
4231040	4233240	I think you're right on the money. It's a live service game.
4233240	4237000	They want they want something that can keep on giving in that regard.
4237000	4240520	So I haven't, you know, wasn't good enough for Sony to purchase,
4240520	4243520	you know, Destiny. We got to have more destiny.
4245160	4248120	Well, one series you can get more and more of.
4248120	4250760	In fact, this series has been going a long time.
4250760	4252440	I remember playing these games.
4252440	4254440	I think these originated
4254440	4257040	their soccer may have to correct me here because it was a CD based system
4257040	4259160	and I didn't have it back in the day. I want to say it was on.
4260440	4264800	Maybe Turbo, I don't remember, but it's Ease series.
4264840	4266320	Oh, yeah. Ease.
4266320	4269400	The Ease games were
4269400	4271680	also Super Nintendo.
4271680	4273160	Yeah, I remember them on Super Nintendo,
4273160	4274440	but I don't think that's where it started.
4274440	4276720	They started on a CD based system, didn't they?
4276720	4280720	I am. I'm pretty sure that PC and that, well,
4280720	4286240	the first Ease Books one and two came out on PC Engine.
4286240	4289240	I have to I'll have to do a little bit of digging
4289240	4293680	because I think that first two came out individually on MSX.
4294960	4297240	I'm going to say, yeah.
4299960	4302120	I know it was done by Nihan Falcom.
4302360	4306600	Yeah, S2100 Matt says PC Engine CD ROM in 1989 and Turbo Graphics CD.
4306600	4307680	That's that sounds right.
4307680	4310320	I think it was a Turbo Graphics thing here. So.
4311080	4314160	Yeah, it was actually it was the PC 8801.
4314960	4315720	OK, that was it.
4315720	4318560	I remembered it was on one of the computer systems and I wanted to say
4319440	4322080	MSX, but no, it was the NEC PC 8801.
4322400	4325640	Well, here we are all these years later, and the series is still going.
4325640	4330040	By the way, I there are a lot of people that think this is called Wise
4330080	4332880	because it's capital Y, lowercase s.
4332880	4335080	And so there's a lot of people that call this series wise.
4335720	4337920	So it's easy. Yeah.
4337920	4339760	Even even I know that pronunciation.
4339760	4340640	That's telling you something.
4340640	4342960	It's been a gamey for a long time as a child.
4343520	4345280	Yeah, no, I didn't know it when I was younger either.
4345280	4346760	So it is what it is.
4346760	4352200	So East or wise to our childhood self is still going.
4352440	4355680	And East is up to come out, by the way, on MSX, too.
4355680	4357320	Just saying, that's why I was thinking of it.
4357320	4359480	Yeah, they poured in a lot of those.
4359480	4365400	But the first game in its original release didn't come out on PC Engine,
4365680	4370640	on what we know as the PC Engine until it was a compilation with one and two.
4370760	4373040	Got it. Well, they're on their 10th game now.
4373680	4377280	And actually, the 10th game is East 10 or is X.
4377280	4381640	Nordics was released on the PlayStation four in 2019.
4382160	4388120	It was is announced, though, that it will be coming out for more platforms in 2023.
4388120	4391440	This is in celebration of the 35th anniversary of the series.
4391720	4396040	So it's going to be coming out for the I think the Nintendo Switch
4396600	4398800	will actually be getting that as well.
4399640	4402840	The Nintendo Switch is also going to get E's memoir.
4403040	4405280	The Oath in Felghana.
4405280	4409040	This is a deepened action RPG, and they're calling this a definitive edition.
4409320	4412840	This was originally released for the PSP in 2010.
4413040	4416320	So this is one that would be pretty hard to get your hands on in 2022,
4416480	4418720	but it will be coming out for the Switch.
4418720	4422240	And this is this is considered one of the better games in the series.
4422840	4427240	And they've also added voiceovers for the protagonist in the game,
4427440	4429840	who's going to be voiced by Yukikaji.
4429840	4432920	It will have a narration by Banju Ginja
4433560	4436680	and an even more dramatic story, thanks to the voiceovers.
4436840	4438000	So that's pretty cool.
4438000	4440880	Also, refined versions of the illustrations
4440880	4443040	for the characters during the story have been created.
4443280	4447240	The classic versions for PSP and PC will also be included.
4447440	4449960	You can switch between refined and classic.
4450800	4454600	Continuing on with that for the Switch, apparently the same is also true
4454600	4457880	of the soundtrack, so you can actually flip back and forth.
4457880	4461640	So if you are, you know, you only want the classic version, you can do that.
4461640	4463720	So that's pretty cool.
4463720	4467920	So, yeah, a series you might have forgotten about,
4467920	4470160	but it's been a lot been around for a very long time.
4470320	4472240	That's a series I got to catch up on sometime.
4472240	4475240	I remember I had a lot of fun on Wanderers from Ys.
4475320	4476800	Yeah, the fourth one.
4476800	4479800	I remember playing one of them on Super Nintendo.
4480240	4483720	I didn't particularly enjoy it at the time,
4484080	4486600	but my tastes have changed a lot as I got older.
4486600	4488640	I would I'd be very curious to revisit it.
4488640	4493000	Some want to say that the first one on Super Nintendo was Wanderers from Ys.
4493560	4496120	It probably was. Yeah, I think it was these three. Yeah.
4496440	4498920	It had like some of my favorite music in it, though,
4498920	4501480	and I beat that game pretty hard.
4502840	4505560	Well, while we're on the subject of classic games,
4505560	4508280	there's no better time than now for this.
4516600	4521960	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time
4521960	4526280	or I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4526640	4529360	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4530280	4533200	And what did you pick tonight, Dark Sakura?
4533200	4536320	Picked Final Fantasy X-2.
4536320	4538800	And I had to make sure I hadn't done it yet, and I haven't.
4539120	4545240	So and for the record, I picked the good version with the music by Kotakumi,
4545920	4549320	because honestly, I like her voice a hell of a lot better.
4551200	4554840	And that and I actually still know the lyrics to all the songs,
4554840	4557120	and I've never bothered learning them in English.
4559920	4561920	And also, you know, it's like with anything,
4561920	4564480	you always like the first version that you played,
4564480	4566400	and I imported this like right away.
4567680	4572640	So Final Fantasy X-2 came out in 2003.
4573480	4576760	It is a role playing video game.
4576760	4579000	It was developed by Square for PS2,
4580360	4584600	and it's actually one of the first examples
4584600	4589360	of a sequel to an in-universe Final Fantasy game,
4589360	4592640	as in typically in the past, they were all standalone.
4593200	4595760	And this one was an actual sequel.
4595760	4599880	So this one is Yuna looking for
4600880	4604320	Tidus, who was the hero from the game before,
4604640	4611200	and also fighting political hardship while looking for these spheres
4611200	4613880	that give them all kinds of magical girl transformation,
4613880	4615160	dress up powers for fun.
4616720	4622240	And it's also the first one to have an all female cast
4622600	4624720	and have just three player characters.
4625360	4630600	And it does harken back to earlier Final Fantasy games
4630600	4633120	where you had your character classes and job leveling.
4634440	4638160	And it also is one of the few
4638160	4641880	Final Fantasy games that has multiple endings.
4643280	4645720	The soundtrack is amazing.
4645720	4651120	It was done by Matsueira Noriko and Eguchi Takahito
4652120	4653840	instead of Uematsu.
4653840	4659200	But I mean, Uematsu is amazing, but this soundtrack is pretty damn amazing, too.
4660080	4661760	And it was pretty successful.
4661760	4665600	I mean, it sold over 5.4 million copies on PS2,
4665840	4670440	won a bunch of awards, and it was the last Final Fantasy
4670440	4675720	game to be released by Square before they merged with Enix in April 2003.
4676720	4680560	It was re-released in high def as Final Fantasy 10
4680560	4683280	slash 10 to HD remaster,
4683920	4687000	which also came out on PlayStation 4 in 2015,
4687000	4690760	Windows in 2016, and Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in 2019.
4691160	4693680	And as of September 2021,
4694040	4698000	the Final Fantasy 10 series had sold over
4698480	4701800	20.8 million units worldwide.
4702480	4707560	And it was even just by March 2022, it surpassed 21.1 million.
4708640	4714840	So the game is set in the same universe, of course, as 10.
4715240	4717800	It is set in the world of Spira.
4717800	4721720	This is two years after the events for Final Fantasy 10.
4722160	4726320	And of course, with their major religion having been completely
4726320	4729360	you know, table flipped,
4730360	4733320	they are picking up the pieces with the younger group
4733960	4736680	going the way of technology and the older people
4736680	4739640	trying to recreate their Yevon religion.
4741280	4743520	And so and then, of course, there's another group
4743520	4746480	that's selling tech to both sides to try to kill each other.
4748520	4751000	But throughout all of this,
4751680	4756520	there is a character spirit who is woken up
4757080	4762800	and possesses certain people to try to end Spira
4763080	4769480	because of how he and his lover, Len, died.
4769920	4774040	In the Japanese version, by the way, Len was voiced by Kotokumi,
4774360	4778400	who sang all the songs, which I think is awesome.
4780680	4783760	But at any rate, a lot of the characters from the previous
4784760	4788840	Final Fantasy 10 showed up as supporting roles
4788840	4790880	like Brother, Waka, and Lulu.
4792920	4795600	There were other new characters introduced,
4795600	4801480	like there was the LeBlanc Syndicate,
4801480	4804040	the faction leaders, other Spira hunters.
4805600	4806760	And then, of course,
4808520	4812040	this is the main antagonist is Eshuin,
4813040	4816000	who is the spirit of a soldier that died
4816000	4819160	during the Makino War a thousand years before.
4821360	4825440	So it's for the seriousness of the story,
4825440	4827720	there is a lot of lightheartedness that goes with it.
4828320	4832680	And I think that there is definitely that message
4833600	4840440	of dealing with lost love and grief that that really appealed to me.
4841000	4845480	And with maybe a little bit of self-exploration through changing,
4845720	4851200	you know, I have seen the dressphere as a sort of like
4851640	4854800	trying on a new identity until you find the one that fits.
4857280	4858800	I mean, I don't know if that makes sense or not,
4858800	4859920	but that's kind of how I saw it.
4859920	4861320	No, it totally does.
4861320	4864840	Yeah. And I mean, especially since Yuna herself,
4864840	4867440	her whole identity had been wrapped up in being a summoner
4867800	4870000	and then there's nothing to summon.
4870640	4874360	Well, in general, this is where her life is going,
4874360	4876600	what she's done to give it purpose.
4878120	4881560	I mean, she totally expected to die in the first game, you know?
4883520	4884680	So at any rate,
4886160	4892200	the development of this was in response to a fan reaction
4892200	4896440	to the eternal calm that was in the Japanese version of Final Fantasy X
4896440	4900000	International that showed Yuna's life after the game.
4901280	4905000	So 10-2 was released
4905680	4908520	shortly before the merger of Square and Enix,
4909040	4912800	and they didn't really care for the name 10-2,
4913160	4916080	but they just took it because it's a sequel and it worked.
4918960	4924120	It also were, and this is actually Nojima Kazushige,
4924120	4928760	the previous game's writer was very skeptical about putting out a sequel,
4929120	4932520	especially one with a happy ending, but
4935520	4936920	they did it.
4939680	4941720	They were given, according to Nomura,
4942080	4947520	they were able to do the game in a year and a half
4947520	4952360	at its standard scope because of all of the character models,
4952360	4956920	the enemies and location designs that were still usable.
4957680	4960520	And then as for most of the creation of this,
4960520	4964040	it was done in Autodesk Maya and Soft Image 3D.
4964480	4966600	I know Maya, and it's a pain in the ass to use.
4969800	4974520	So they said that the objective, the producers and directors said that
4974840	4977560	the objective when designing the game was to embrace
4977560	4979640	the concept of change as the main theme,
4980400	4982080	which is what I was bringing up before.
4982080	4983760	And they did make it more upbeat.
4983760	4985400	That's definitely what they wanted to do.
4987320	4992320	They wanted to show what a drastic change was in Spira,
4994000	4997000	because there's no summons, they redesigned to some of the towns,
4997000	4998600	they included different vehicles,
5000760	5005120	and they had different elements that came directly from Japanese pop culture.
5005640	5011280	And then they wanted to bring in,
5011800	5018600	they talked about bringing in Lulu as the third person instead of Pine,
5020840	5025480	because she would have been more of like an older sister
5025480	5028640	rather than Yuna being able to stand on her own feet.
5029440	5032480	But they did give her a baby in the previous game.
5034480	5037600	As far as the music goes, I mean, like I said,
5038280	5040880	it has a little bit more of a pop feel to it,
5040880	5046960	and the songs Real Emotion and Sen no Kotoba were done by Kotokumi.
5048560	5053040	And she also did the motion capture for Yuna's dancing
5053040	5055560	and did the voice for Len.
5056760	5061920	Of course, the US one was done by Jade Villalon of Sweetbox,
5062560	5068880	who released full versions of the songs for her Japanese release of Adagio.
5069400	5075000	And Kotokumi released English versions of these on a CD single for Come With Me,
5075000	5077040	although the translations for both are different.
5078720	5081560	But I mean, there was merchandise for everything.
5081560	5082640	There was so much.
5087600	5090360	There was an expanded version,
5090360	5093200	which is the Final Fantasy X-2 International and The Last Mission,
5094080	5096160	that had two new dresspheres,
5096160	5101040	additional last mission location at the Yadanoki Tower,
5102320	5106960	and the ability to capture and battle different monsters.
5106960	5111920	And it had Tidus, Aran, and Seymour from Final Fantasy X.
5112240	5114720	It was not released outside of Japan,
5114720	5118480	even though it had the English voice track to use for the majority of the story.
5118480	5120000	But I have that copy.
5120000	5127360	And there were action figures and books and soundtracks and art books
5127360	5132840	and strategy guides and Ultimania guidebooks and all kinds of stuff.
5132840	5139000	Horii, the peripheral gaming company,
5140600	5145720	had controllers that were modeled after Yuna's Tiny Bee guns.
5146840	5148360	These only came out in Japan.
5148360	5151240	They were also re-released in the silver box
5151240	5154360	with the release of The International and Last Mission.
5155280	5157960	And then they also created a vertical stand for the PS2
5157960	5161640	with the Final Fantasy X-2 logo that lights up in blue when it's plugged in.
5163880	5167280	And so, of course, there was the HD version that came out.
5167280	5171320	It worked with Kitase Yoshinori involved.
5171320	5181040	And, you know, all of these releases of it were pretty well received.
5181040	5183520	I mean, the soundtrack was kind of mixed
5183520	5188840	because it kind of went on that J-pop front instead of with any input from Uematsu.
5190760	5193440	EGM called it too bubbly, but what do they know?
5196360	5199440	I mean, there's just way too many people that were complaining about
5200400	5202160	missing the old guard.
5202160	5207880	But the thing is that this game was meant to embody the new,
5208200	5212680	you know, to indicate change, to show a change in the world,
5212680	5216600	a change in people, personality, that type of thing.
5218400	5221640	And so after this one came out,
5221960	5225120	they finally did other direct sequels to Final Fantasy games,
5225120	5228880	including Dirge of Cerberus and then Final Fantasy IV,
5228880	5233120	The After Years, and two sequels to Final Fantasy XIII.
5236480	5239880	I mean, this is the other problem that people had with this game,
5239880	5241600	is that it was considered girly.
5242800	5248080	And I think that the people who didn't like it because it was girly
5248920	5251480	need to have their... I think that they're full of shit.
5251760	5254320	So I'm not going to mince my words about it.
5256120	5261800	But I really liked that with enough work,
5262520	5265960	you could get a happy ending to this game.
5266480	5270200	I mean, spoilers for how old game is this now?
5271120	5276560	But in one of... there's actually two extra endings where one of them,
5277000	5282360	you get Tidus back, like the Faith fully bring him back as a real boy.
5282360	5283200	He's a real boy now.
5284200	5288520	And then the other one, you have an extended conversation
5288520	5291320	between him and Yuna and Zanarkand,
5292200	5296440	where they talk about, you know, are you real?
5296440	5300240	And it's like, well, yeah, as real as you think I am, I guess.
5300880	5303440	You know, but it's a really interesting,
5304240	5308160	you know, it's a very serious conversation for a lighthearted ending.
5308880	5314400	But at any rate, I love this game.
5315080	5318320	I much prefer the music in Japanese
5318320	5321640	just because I was a big Kotokumi fan before this game came out.
5322360	5327280	So I'm not going to say that the US,
5328400	5329880	the English versions are bad.
5329880	5330880	I mean, they're great.
5330880	5333000	And if I had heard them first, I might have liked them better.
5333000	5335360	But it is what it is.
5335360	5337920	So that's why I wanted to put up the Japanese copy,
5337920	5339760	because that's the version I like best.
5340920	5344720	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Final Fantasy X-2.
5344960	5348360	This is also interesting because I don't remember exactly
5348360	5351520	the year this came out, but it must have been around 2013.
5352360	5354560	It was 2013. It was really that far.
5354560	5355800	I thought it was more around the time
5355800	5358840	when this show had just started as a 2003.
5359160	5360960	OK, I was going to say, I thought it was around the time
5360960	5362840	this show started as a podcast.
5362840	5364880	I don't know why I said 2013. It was 2003.
5365360	5368480	Because I remember in an early episode of OLR,
5368480	5373320	we were like, Jamie was saying it's 10-2 and I kept saying X-2.
5373520	5375680	And I was like, you know what, I'm just going to email Square.
5375680	5380520	And they actually wrote back and Square confirmed that it was 10-2
5380520	5382080	is the correct pronunciation of it.
5382080	5384440	So it was just is kind of kind of fun.
5384440	5386240	I've been smug about it ever since.
5386240	5388280	Yeah, let me tell you about it. Yeah.
5388520	5391320	So no, but it's it's it's kind of, you know, neat.
5391720	5393880	But it was it was certainly unconventional naming.
5393880	5395800	Like, you know, there was a part of me that always wondered,
5395800	5398640	why didn't they just make this Final Fantasy 11
5399000	5402960	and call what ultimately was Final Fantasy 11 Final Fantasy Online?
5403200	5407240	Because Final Fantasy 11 just doesn't feel like a standard Final Fantasy game.
5407360	5410360	And so what? There's a few characters in common.
5410560	5414440	But I understand ultimately what each world is its own.
5414560	5416120	Yeah, I know.
5416120	5419160	Especially think of it like the Marvel Universe, right? Right.
5419280	5421320	The main universe is 616.
5421320	5423720	And then there's, you know, all these other numbers.
5423720	5427560	Well, and especially then when they started doing 13 and 13,
5427560	5429920	two in the after years and all the other stuff you named in there,
5430160	5432480	like, especially when they started getting into all that.
5432480	5435080	Like, I understand why they did what they did.
5435080	5439400	But yeah, I mean, you know, it's it's hard to understate
5439400	5442680	just what a big deal it was that they were doing a sequel
5442680	5445240	to a Final Fantasy game like this at the time. It was weird.
5445560	5450080	But now it's less weird, very giddy and then being excited about importing it.
5450360	5452400	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
5452400	5456520	So but but no, it's it's I mean, even to this day,
5456520	5459360	I think as a game, it still holds up. Mm hmm.
5459840	5461920	So confession, I've barely played it.
5462320	5464600	I know this surprises people, but I've barely played it.
5465040	5468640	I keep meaning to get around to the HD remaster, but I keep saying
5468640	5471160	I'm not going to play it until I beat Final Fantasy 10.
5471160	5472080	And we all know what happens.
5472080	5475280	Of course, I don't because something shiny comes out of the international copy.
5475480	5479360	I have the HD remasters, you know, which I think the newer ones,
5479360	5482840	the HD remasters, do they have the newer ones are, I think.
5482840	5486760	I think the original ones on PS3 weren't.
5486760	5491040	But then the ones on PS4 were, I think. Don't hold me on that.
5492320	5494480	So I'll have to go back and look.
5494480	5496480	But I saw something.
5496480	5498600	Where is it? There is one about the
5499880	5500920	the other release.
5500920	5504560	Here we go. The last mission.
5505720	5507440	Did this change parts of the Japanese subtitles
5507440	5509280	or change or alter to fit the voiceovers?
5509280	5511960	This is detailed strategy book for the international version.
5515560	5518560	It doesn't. I mean, they probably were,
5518560	5520640	but it didn't say anything about it being included,
5520640	5523320	but I wouldn't doubt that it was. Yeah.
5523320	5525960	As Joe points out, they were on Game Pass until recently.
5525960	5526880	I believe you're right.
5526880	5529800	The Final Fantasy games were kind of a lot of them were cycling through,
5529960	5532840	but they appear to only be good for a year because like Final Fantasy
5532840	5536240	13 and 13 two are no longer there or like
5536640	5540360	13 two is almost up as is lightning returns.
5540360	5543720	So, yeah, they're kind of cycling through Game Pass, unfortunately.
5543720	5546520	So you got to buy it at this point.
5546520	5550400	But those I mean, they've been out a while and they go on sale frequently.
5550400	5553880	So it's pretty easy to pick up whatever Final Fantasy HD game
5553880	5557080	you want for 20 bucks if you just wait for the right sale.
5557080	5561320	And considering we're coming up on all the storefront holiday sales,
5561320	5564960	especially what Steam starts December 22nd, Epic just started.
5565280	5569600	I'm sure PlayStation and Microsoft are going to set their sales
5569600	5573000	before they leave the office next week, and then it'll be a sale for like two weeks.
5573320	5575640	So. It's coming
5577120	5579520	if you want to catch up on that stuff.
5579520	5581040	All right. Great pick.
5581040	5584240	I'm as surprised as anyone else that hadn't been picked already,
5584240	5588240	but that happens sometimes some good ones slip through all of surprises.
5588240	5589720	Yeah. All right.
5589720	5592480	Let's travel around quickly and check out some other news
5592520	5595280	going on in the industry in some rapid fire news.
5595280	5599720	Loki. Yeah. So first off, I want to start with a cool ROM hack
5599720	5601880	that I saw posted on Twitter.
5601880	5606960	So this is actually a it's called Contravania, the Ecclesia edition.
5606960	5609880	It is a ROM hack of Castlevania
5611280	5612760	order of Ecclesia.
5612760	5617120	And it's basically adds
5617560	5619920	the characters from Contra,
5620400	5622600	mainly actually a Contra rebirth
5623120	5625880	into the game, and it plays like Contra.
5626320	5628360	That is very awesome.
5628640	5631360	So they have multiple different patches
5631360	5634080	you can do to it to get different characters in there.
5634080	5638480	So they have like Bill Riser, Genbei, Yagyu,
5639240	5642560	Propotector, Pliskin, Brad Fang,
5642560	5645520	and then for some reason, Sans from Undertales in there.
5645520	5648760	I don't really know what that's all about, but it looks.
5650400	5652560	I'm sorry, we said Yagyu Jubei.
5653920	5656720	It's Genbei Yagyu.
5657120	5660480	It's there from Contra Rebirth.
5661000	5664200	OK, I was just thinking of the of
5664720	5668720	I mean, because a lot of games will reuse the historical person as a character.
5668720	5672560	And I was like, whoa, well, it's sort of kind of like so that
5672880	5675840	that person is sort of kind of based off of that.
5675840	5678440	They look like a samurai, but the eye patch and everything.
5679040	5680240	Yes. And they have.
5680240	5681880	OK, that's cool.
5681880	5684240	So, yeah, that's awesome.
5684240	5686640	Yeah. So they've got that.
5686640	5690040	It's it looks cool.
5690040	5692560	Like I just saw the gameplay online and it's amazing.
5692560	5694480	But yeah, it's for the DS version of the game.
5694480	5698280	So there is, I think, one emulator on PC that works with it.
5698280	5702160	And obviously, if you have a flash cart, you can put it on your actual DS
5702440	5705440	and then, you know, lots of other homebrew options
5705440	5707800	available for playing DS games as well.
5708520	5710400	So go check that out. Pretty cool.
5710400	5713800	And then Super Nintendo World
5713800	5718160	in Universal Hollywood finally has an opening date,
5718160	5722240	and that is February 17th, 2023.
5722240	5724560	We can go experience
5725320	5728360	the boring Yoshi ride and then the komari car ride.
5729200	5730960	That's going to sneak up on us.
5730960	5733680	February 17th is, if you think about it, like two months away.
5734080	5736080	So, yeah, not that long.
5736080	5738120	Yeah, I'm excited. I want to go check it out.
5738160	5739880	I don't think I'll go the first day for sure.
5739880	5743480	But no, if I can, if I can figure out when spring break is
5743480	5747040	and like not go that week either, like on a weekday in March or April.
5747040	5748720	Sounds great to just check it out.
5748720	5749760	I think it'll be a lot of fun.
5749760	5751640	Yeah, I want to go again.
5753000	5755960	All right, Darcy.
5755960	5762080	So Amazon has announced that they are developing a God of War series.
5763760	5766600	They were in talks with Sony to adapt it.
5766760	5768680	They reported this back in March,
5769920	5774760	and they were reporting that the creators and producers of The Expanse,
5775400	5780040	along with the executive producer of Wheel of Time,
5781120	5785760	would be leading the project with input from Sony.
5785760	5787800	And Amazon said, yep, we're doing that.
5789240	5792880	So we'll see how it turns out.
5794560	5795960	We're going to hear a lot of boy.
5795960	5798440	Yeah. Speaking of things that are around the corner,
5798440	5801160	that Last of Us series is just a couple of weeks away.
5801160	5803480	So it's oh, wow. Yeah, it's like a quick.
5803520	5805280	Yeah, right. Mid-January, right?
5805280	5806520	It's going to be here before we know it.
5806520	5809720	So wild. But yeah, God of War, that should be fun, too.
5811360	5812920	All right. Moving on.
5812920	5815680	I got really excited at the Game Awards when I heard that Sony's
5815680	5818200	Returnal is going to be coming out for PC.
5818520	5821600	And I guess I'm thankful I have a new rig because I have enough RAM
5821600	5822440	to make this work.
5822440	5827240	But boy, oh boy, they are recommending 32 gigs of RAM.
5827920	5832040	You can run Returnal with 16 gigs, but they are recommending
5832040	5835520	this is per Returnal Steam listing 32 gigs to get the most out of,
5835520	5837400	you know, the graphics and the gameplay.
5837400	5840040	For the record, Microsoft's Flight Simulator,
5840040	5844080	which if you've ever played that game, especially in 4K, is gorgeous.
5844520	5848440	That game requires eight and recommends 16.
5848440	5850840	So Returnal needs more RAM than Flight Simulator.
5851040	5853200	Honestly, I'm kind of not surprised considering, you know,
5853200	5855200	what a fast moving game Returnal is.
5855200	5857640	Flight Simulator is more of a fly and chill.
5857840	5860640	Returnal has like a lot of stuff going on on the screen.
5860640	5863720	It's a very fast moving game, so not completely surprised.
5864400	5865720	That's probably why it needs so much RAM.
5865720	5868040	Sounds like it's very unoptimized, if you ask me.
5868600	5870240	That could probably be, too.
5870240	5874720	So we'll see. No, no, no, nothing known yet.
5874720	5877960	If it will include support for Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's
5877960	5882640	FSR's upscaling technology, but we'll see.
5883400	5886440	Apparently, some leaked video is giving insight that it might.
5888120	5890440	Also, other system requirements.
5890440	5896400	You'll need an Intel i7-8700 or an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X CPU.
5896600	5902040	And you need to have at least an Nvidia RTX 2070 Super or an AMD RX
5902040	5905760	6700 XT GPU to meet the recommended specs.
5905760	5907120	Money.
5907120	5910960	Yeah, I know it's, but I mean, you know, you're talking about playing
5910960	5915000	a PlayStation 5 game on your PC, so I can understand why it's so demanding.
5915000	5918200	But yeah, it's not going to be cheap, that's for sure, though.
5919600	5923640	I will probably pick it up, but we'll see.
5925040	5928920	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5928920	5934040	I don't know if it's still busy, but I guess especially with digital storefronts,
5934040	5936600	who knows, but I feel like this time of year is more for sales.
5936600	5938040	But let's see anyway.
5938040	5940080	Loki, anything coming out in the US this week?
5940080	5941040	Not a lot.
5941040	5943480	There's Majestic
5944680	5948760	Magical looks like, and that's on Nintendo Switch.
5949840	5954960	Uta no Princess Sama All Star After Secret on Nintendo Switch
5954960	5959200	and Valkyrie Profile Lineth on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5959400	5961400	That's it. That's it for the year.
5961400	5962920	We're all done.
5962920	5966000	All right. Well, going to Japan, obviously, the holidays flow
5966040	5967320	a little different there.
5967320	5970200	So you do have some releases still on the Nintendo Switch this week,
5970200	5973080	including that same Uta no Prince Sama is out this week.
5973360	5976440	Earth Defense Force 4.1, The Shadow of New Despair.
5976440	5978400	That is coming out in Japan this week.
5979000	5982520	Majestic Majolical is also out this week,
5983040	5986360	as well as Fitness Boxing Fist of the North Star,
5986760	5987640	which I want to see.
5987640	5989160	Didn't we talk about that on a previous show
5989160	5991400	because we talked about the arcade game they used to have?
5991400	5994800	Well, that's finally out on the Switch this week, so enjoy that.
5995360	5997720	Money Parasite is out this week as well.
5997920	6001520	And a game called Witch's Garden in regular and limited edition
6001520	6003840	is also out on the Switch this week.
6003840	6006040	Going over to the PlayStation 5.
6006040	6007800	That one's a little more empty.
6007800	6010080	We might see like one lone release next week,
6010080	6012600	but otherwise a little quiet on the PS5 front.
6012680	6014840	But lots of stuff for Switch fans this week.
6014840	6017520	How about the UK Dark Sakura?
6017520	6020040	One thing on there and didn't even give it a date.
6021160	6022400	Oh, actually, I take that back.
6022400	6024960	The date was yesterday
6025240	6028480	for Switch was WRC Generations.
6029480	6031400	All right. Well, it's that time of year
6031400	6033920	where things are slowing down to be expected.
6033920	6036280	All right. We have just a few more stories for you,
6036280	6038440	and then we will get to the listener roundtable.
6038440	6040040	I know we have at least one email tonight,
6040040	6044800	and we'll see if we get any comments and possibly some calls over at Discord,
6044800	6046480	our VOG Network Discord server.
6046480	6049760	Speaking of Discord, we're going to do something next week.
6049760	6051960	Show is on a weird day.
6052240	6054280	So we're going to do something a little bit special,
6054280	6055720	and it's going to involve Discord.
6055720	6057520	And I'm going to explain that in a little bit.
6057520	6062200	But first, let's get into a few more stories, starting with Loki.
6063120	6066520	Yeah, so Justin Roiland's new game High on Life.
6066960	6069520	It was revealed that the bigger studio
6070160	6074720	Squanch Games used the AI art tool mid journey AI
6075040	6079400	to generate some assets for the game
6079720	6082840	and add some quote unquote finishing touches.
6084960	6089360	Now, basically, they were saying that they used AI art tools
6090720	6094400	because it doesn't look like as if a person made them.
6094400	6096920	It's kind of like almost alien, sort of.
6098280	6102920	And so they said it made the world feel like a strange alternate
6102920	6105240	universe of our world.
6105280	6109520	And we used it to make or to come up with weird, funny ideas.
6109960	6113640	So I can imagine like generating different things and it's all messed up.
6113640	6117360	So then they take those assets to kind of
6118000	6121000	make their own art, I guess it's almost like concept art, I guess.
6123560	6126760	Basically saying I don't know what that's in very well with Rick and Morty.
6127360	6130840	Yeah, I don't know what the future holds, but AI is going to be a tool
6130840	6134360	that has potential to make content creation incredibly accessible.
6134360	6136400	I don't know how many years away we are,
6136680	6141000	but all you will need is somebody with some big ideas.
6141640	6145000	Of course, you know, it's still controversial with using AI art
6145000	6150160	anyways, because it is being trained off of a lot of artists
6150160	6153280	work who didn't necessarily consent to being used.
6153640	6157240	And one of those major sites that artists do showcase
6157240	6160240	a lot of their work that they do is, of course,
6161240	6167440	ArtStation, who was actually being included in some of these AI trainings
6167440	6172680	and made a comment regarding permission and AI art generators.
6172680	6176480	This is we believe artists should be free to decide how their art is used.
6176480	6180000	And simultaneously, we don't want to become gatekeepers with the site
6180640	6184640	terms that stifle AI research and commercialization
6184880	6188640	when it respects artists choices and copyright laws.
6189040	6193560	So their plans right now are going to be enabling
6194320	6197520	or adding tags enabling artists to choose explicitly to allow
6197520	6202200	or disallow the use of art for training and non-commercial AI research
6202480	6204800	and to train commercial AI.
6205120	6207080	And they plan to update ArtStation
6207720	6210920	website's terms of service to disallow the use of art or whatever.
6212600	6214560	Artists aren't happy about that
6214560	6217280	because they feel they should be taking a stronger stance
6217520	6221560	to protect their works, but they are not doing that.
6221560	6226480	So obviously, they have been protesting by putting no AI type stuff.
6226720	6230120	Also, like, I mean, it doesn't account for all the AI
6230120	6232440	that's already been trained on that stuff, so.
6234160	6236680	I don't know, it's it's it's a tricky subject.
6238400	6243280	Yeah, it's tricky because, you know, obviously I don't love the idea of AI,
6243280	6246360	you know, basically because like, you know, that app that came out recently,
6246360	6248920	I remember it was called, but everybody was posting their pictures on Facebook
6248920	6252200	and stuff, and for me, I was a little I was more like,
6252200	6254840	I feel like every time one of these hot new apps comes out,
6254840	6256920	you find out something about the development team you don't like.
6256920	6259320	So I stayed away from it.
6259320	6262000	But, you know, it looked like a lot of the pictures that are coming out of it
6262000	6266280	are basically like artwork that literally was someone else's,
6266280	6269320	but like with someone's head slapped onto it
6269320	6272320	and the fingers all different because I can never get fingers right.
6272840	6276000	So it's like a former president's NFT drop or something.
6276000	6278360	It's really weird. I'm not going to go there.
6279040	6282800	But, you know, so so AI is is really silly in that regard.
6282800	6285800	And the fact that, you know, it's using stolen artwork isn't cool.
6286160	6291520	However, that being said, I don't like to just brush off AI artistry
6291520	6295040	all in one fell swoop because I kind of see where,
6295320	6298560	you know, if we're talking about next gen gaming, especially when we get into
6298880	6302840	like PlayStation six game development, I know I'm getting way ahead of myself here.
6303080	6306440	But you know how hard it's going to be to animate for these,
6306440	6310360	you know, 8K TVs or whatever, you know, graphical fidelities coming up next
6310360	6312440	and so forth, it's going to get harder and harder.
6312440	6317080	So I can see where maybe AI starts to get useful
6317080	6321840	in developing like really high definition art later on.
6321840	6326200	But that would all be trained off of art that the studio is doing
6326200	6328560	and rules that the studio builds into their engine,
6328720	6330600	which is obviously a very different sort of argument.
6330840	6334200	But that's where I'm like, OK, that's where AI art makes sense to me,
6334200	6337280	is literally automating processes
6337280	6340760	that otherwise would cause a game 20 years to get made.
6341000	6342280	That makes sense.
6342280	6345800	But the whole like, you know, plugging your face or your
6346000	6348680	and I see this shit for sale on Facebook all the time,
6348840	6353200	plugging your dog into the dogs playing poker artwork and all this stuff like
6353200	6354040	this is silly.
6354040	6357560	And, you know, obviously dogs playing poker is one because that's classic.
6357560	6361720	But when it's, you know, somebody's deviant art or art station or whatever,
6361720	6365040	and it feels a little slimy to be doing that to me.
6365160	6367320	They've had some really cool like applications
6367320	6370040	even outside of the art stuff, like the chat GPT stuff,
6370040	6373440	which where you can actually have like conversations with the chat bot
6373440	6376520	and it'll like, you know, I said, OK, like, here's some code I wrote.
6376520	6379760	Can you rewrite it in this language and it will do it for you or like,
6379960	6383200	hey, I need you to generate me something that does this
6383200	6385880	and it will usually do it correctly.
6386200	6387840	And it's pretty incredible, like some of the stuff
6387840	6391080	where they'll explain to you like how to do something in a certain way.
6391080	6393400	And it's pretty cool.
6393400	6397800	So like that, combined with like some of these things, it's me.
6398040	6400920	It's when you kind of take it to the extremes, though, where it's
6400920	6403080	it's starting to get a little bit like ridiculous.
6403080	6407000	Like there is somebody who generated a.
6408120	6410040	Children's book using an A.I.
6410040	6412960	to write the book for him and then use another A.I.
6412960	6415680	to create the pictures for it and then publish that as his own work.
6416120	6418200	Which is kind of like.
6418600	6420560	I don't know, it's a little weird.
6420560	6422320	It is a little weird.
6422760	6426000	Credit, it's definitely on the darker side of gray.
6426000	6429000	Yeah, credit the robot with writing the book, right?
6429000	6431360	Credit credit seven and nine with writing your book.
6431360	6435080	You know, don't credit, you know, yourself.
6435320	6437040	It's a little silly.
6437040	6439200	And then right now we've had all the A.I.
6439200	6443960	is being trained off of like with specific rules in place.
6444280	6446960	Like what's going to happen later on when
6446960	6451320	we start having people train them to do other things like, you know.
6452320	6455680	Photoshop celebrities into different pornographic situations.
6455720	6458920	Oh, yeah. And it's just going to get nuts.
6458960	6462760	Yeah, that's, you know, or or like even not even necessarily that,
6462760	6465960	but like even like the faking, deep fakes, deeper fakes,
6466240	6468280	deepest fakes, deep, dark fakes.
6469080	6472600	Yeah, like faking, because you can have a I generate voices
6472600	6477040	like it can take someone's voice and figure out how to speak like it
6477040	6480360	and reproduce that with whatever you want.
6480360	6482280	So like you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.
6483800	6485080	Wild, wild.
6485080	6486080	Well, that A.I.
6486080	6488760	to determine whether something's A.I. generated or not. Right.
6489960	6492320	The test determined that was A.I.
6494240	6494600	All right.
6494600	6495880	I just need an A.I.
6495880	6498680	to prove that I'm not a robot so that, you know,
6498680	6500200	I don't have to fill those things out anymore.
6501080	6503600	Maybe, maybe we all are secretly half Cylon.
6503600	6506600	Who knows? Anyway,
6506600	6508880	Dijarama says Adobe came out with a program for A.I.
6508880	6511440	voices caused an uproar in the voice acting community.
6511440	6514160	Oh, I bet. Tiger Cost says there's A.I.
6514160	6517720	generated podcast that had Joe Rogan interviewing Steve Jobs.
6517720	6520200	I can think of nothing I want to hear less.
6520200	6523080	All right. In a sense, yes, yes, I get that.
6523080	6524560	Like and that's horrible.
6524560	6529600	But I'm just saying, but I do like the premise of like generating
6529640	6531400	funny things with some of these.
6531400	6534160	Like, for example, it's funnier when it's like the daily show
6534160	6536680	using clips from an actual interview.
6536720	6537680	Well, no, I like that.
6537680	6540760	But like there is something I saw where it was like like
6541400	6542600	it was that chat chat
6542600	6546000	GBT thing where it's like, hey, I want you to explain me this
6546240	6550160	as a script for Seinfeld or something like there's a Seinfeld episode.
6550360	6551320	And that was funny.
6551320	6554320	Like some of the stuff that they do with that,
6554320	6557000	I think is pretty funny. Hmm.
6557000	6558120	All right.
6558160	6561760	Well, I don't know if a robot could create this next game,
6561760	6563520	but Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
6565920	6571040	A very, very interesting flashback,
6571040	6573720	I would say, you know, emphasis on the flash
6574920	6578400	Fantavision 2020 X
6579720	6585560	is coming out on PlayStation five with PlayStation VR to support.
6586040	6591400	It's going to be a digital game to release on February 22nd, 2023.
6592680	6595560	And now the original came out on PlayStation two.
6595760	6599960	As I'm sure we might remember, it was people like, what's with this game?
6600240	6603080	And then everyone played it and was like, oh, this game is kind of addicting.
6604880	6608680	But you basically hit like different missiles,
6609040	6611520	kind of, I guess, defender ish.
6612320	6615120	Am I thinking of defender or missile command?
6615440	6617560	Missile command, my brain, I can't brain.
6618720	6621480	And then they explode and they're pretty.
6621480	6622720	There's more to it than that.
6622720	6625400	But the explode and pretty part is is really awesome.
6626480	6629960	And then it'll have like vibration feedback through the controller
6629960	6634200	and all kinds of haptic joy and and explosions.
6634560	6637040	And then you get a star mine.
6637040	6642040	I don't know if their trailer does it justice, but it doesn't look that great.
6642040	6645240	Like it's like I saw the trailer graphic.
6646040	6650000	It does look like Fantavision, but it doesn't look like a PlayStation five game.
6650000	6651680	It looks like a PlayStation three game.
6651680	6655680	And it's like and I get it like maybe for the VR part of that,
6655680	6659080	they have a scale of all the one on PlayStation VR to be able to push
6659440	6661560	better fidelity than that.
6661560	6663640	It just doesn't look.
6663640	6668160	It looks dated like and that's too bad because Fantavision was great title.
6668160	6674560	I can tell you just said it just now, Jamie, that the game's coming out in February.
6674560	6678280	I kind of forgot that PSVR two is like that close to release.
6678280	6681120	I thought we were still a ways out from that, but wowee.
6682000	6684120	Well, Shane's in chat and he's excited for this.
6684120	6687480	He says, I'm here day one for Fantavision for my PSVR two.
6687680	6691280	There's like 30 launch titles now for it, and it makes me more excited to get mine.
6691440	6695240	I hope the crazy, nonsensical Fantavision cutscenes are in this one, too.
6695960	6697960	Dr. Seuss says, I'm surprised they brought this back.
6697960	6700800	I think this is one of the first PS two games I ever played.
6700800	6701800	Yeah, a lot of love.
6701800	6703080	A lot of people is like their first.
6703080	6705360	Maybe it's the YouTube dance now.
6705640	6706920	Doo doo doo doo doo.
6706920	6710200	Of course. Maybe it's the YouTube compression that's doing it
6710200	6712320	because I'm looking at the screenshots and they look better.
6712320	6715920	But like, yeah, the YouTube video does not look great.
6716960	6719960	Check your options and make sure it's not defaulting to a low resolution.
6720040	6721840	No, it's 1080. It's just.
6721840	6726880	Yeah, because they're they're talking about like 4K graphics and stuff like that.
6726880	6729280	And so maybe maybe that would look better,
6729280	6732120	but it did look kind of not great in the other one.
6732440	6736120	SSG100 Matt says, semi-related, I kind of miss Boom Boom Rocket.
6736120	6737280	I should try to reload it.
6737280	6738680	Oh, that was a good one.
6738680	6741040	I think it is backwards compatible.
6741040	6745040	I believe if you had that on 360, it shows up in your Xbox one library,
6745800	6748440	which would in turn show up in your Series X library.
6748920	6753360	And all the songs in that game were like redone classical tunes.
6753360	6754920	It's like the William Tell Overture and stuff.
6754920	6756920	So they don't have to worry about licensing,
6757480	6759520	causing the game to get delisted or any of that stuff.
6759520	6762800	So if you had Boom Boom Rocket, I don't know if they still sell it.
6763440	6765720	I don't see why they wouldn't, though.
6765720	6768840	But yeah, Boom Boom Rocket was like kind of Fantavision meets
6768840	6771080	an actual music game title. It was a little bit of both.
6771360	6774080	So I remember that one. It was a lot of fun.
6774080	6778240	I remember there was one achievement I couldn't get and I was so mad.
6778240	6780600	I don't remember which one it was, but I almost want to go back and do it.
6780920	6781880	So, oh, Dr.
6781880	6784040	C is I know I saw it on the store still.
6784040	6786480	All right. Well, it's still there. That's cool.
6786480	6790120	All right. Loki, another Hollywood story. Yeah.
6790760	6795440	Yep. I keep forgetting that they are actually making a Five Nights at Freddy's
6795440	6800200	movie, Blumhouse's, and they've announced a couple more actors
6800200	6801480	that are joining the cast.
6801480	6804000	So Matthew Lillard from,
6804960	6808880	you know, a 13 ghost scream and of course, you know, Shaggy
6810880	6814440	and then Josh Hutcherson, who I recognize,
6814440	6816480	but I don't remember which movies it in.
6816480	6818600	They say tragedy girls, but I've never seen that.
6818600	6820000	But he's been in other things, too.
6821840	6824480	And what's cool is they say Jim Henson's
6824480	6827040	creature shop is working on the animatronic.
6827080	6829680	Oh, that's fun. That's going to be good.
6830280	6832120	I mean, fantastic.
6832120	6833240	So I can't wait to see this.
6833280	6834200	Don't know what's coming out.
6834200	6836320	They started filming back in February.
6838960	6840840	Yeah. Walk the wait and see you get.
6840840	6844960	Or well, maybe with the did they film in February or they got to start filming?
6844960	6846800	They start and you know, I'll be gone.
6846800	6851120	And I was going to say, you don't announce your cast eight months after.
6851200	6854280	Yeah. OK, so yeah, they're going to start filming in February.
6854280	6858760	So hopefully, hopefully they're in the next year or, you know, early 2024.
6859600	6864240	Mission chat says can confirm Boom Boom Rocket is still on the Xbox store for 10 bucks.
6864280	6866120	So there you go about that one.
6866120	6869240	As John Hunter Matt agrees, it will be great that Jim Henson's
6869240	6871200	creature shop is working on this.
6871200	6873840	Tiger Claw is wondering, I wonder what the tone of the movie will be,
6873840	6876760	a horror comedy, and will it be PG-13?
6876920	6878640	I think it's almost certainly PG-13.
6878640	6881680	They're not going to go are and think the games were never gory.
6881680	6885280	It was always implied violence is jump scares and implied violence.
6885280	6887640	So I really don't see why it's not.
6887640	6889400	So it's hard to say.
6889400	6891360	I guess that's true.
6891680	6896680	But I feel like they kind of market some of the merch at kids.
6896680	6899880	So I don't know why they would want to shut at least like older teens.
6899880	6901760	I don't know why they would want to shut them out of the movie.
6901760	6903280	I think that would be foolish.
6903280	6905000	You're right. I think it probably would be like a team.
6905000	6908000	Yeah, I think they're going to aim for PG-13 and it's
6908280	6910040	they're just going to not be gory.
6910040	6913040	But even it's like looking at like some of their other movies
6913040	6917080	that they had come out, like was it that one Megan with the creepy doll thing?
6917120	6918560	Can't fucking wait for that.
6918560	6921080	Just to be clear, the PG-13.
6921080	6924080	So a lot of horror movies are PG-13.
6924160	6925440	They're just they're not super gory.
6925440	6928920	The Ring was PG-13 when it was, you know, the U.S. version
6928920	6931440	when Naomi Watts was was PG-13.
6931440	6935360	The Sixth Sense, even though maybe not the best example, I think was PG-13.
6935360	6937040	Or did they say fuck too much in that movie?
6937040	6939000	It might have been an hour, but I think it was PG-13.
6939000	6940640	I mean, something like Hereditary.
6940640	6942040	Yeah, of course, that's art.
6942040	6945400	If you know that movie or God, what was the other one that director did?
6945400	6948400	It's like one of Dark Soccer's favorite movies, not Hereditary Midsommar.
6948960	6950920	If Midsommar is great.
6950920	6953360	Yeah, but Midsommar is definitely R rated.
6955280	6958280	But you can do horror movies and PG-13 for sure.
6958320	6962640	And and by the way, that Megan movie, it's only out in a couple of weeks.
6963520	6964600	Oh, I'm so excited.
6964600	6967640	I want to see every six Avatar two.
6967680	6968720	I'm like, eh, whatever.
6968720	6970600	Megan, fuck yes.
6970600	6973440	I meant to go out this week to see Violent Night,
6973440	6976880	but that may be a way to see on video.
6976880	6979600	Remember when we all went to go see the first Avatar together?
6979600	6982760	We went on a big date together and we saw it in 3D.
6982760	6983680	I think it was the theater.
6983680	6985680	I saw it so many times. I don't remember.
6985720	6989640	Yeah, I've heard good things about it to the sequel, honestly.
6989680	6991600	Yeah, I've heard good things about Avatar, too.
6991600	6997000	But I and keep in mind the original Poltergeist was PG because PG-13 didn't exist.
6997000	6998920	Yep. Yep. Yeah.
6998920	7001160	She-Hope just pointed out about Poltergeist being PG.
7001160	7003320	Yeah, but it would have been PG-13 if that had existed.
7003320	7005040	That's for sure. So, yeah.
7005040	7007680	So. All right.
7007680	7013240	Moving on, let's go to our last story tonight, which very random,
7013240	7015840	but sometimes random things turn up in the gaming world.
7016120	7018800	And it's a lost Michael Jackson clip.
7018800	7022720	And it has to do with Michael Jackson and the Sega world.
7022880	7026960	You remember how Michael Jackson very clearly worked with Sega,
7026960	7029720	like was kind of shadow working on some projects, right?
7030720	7037960	Well, apparently, some fans have actually uncovered an extra kind of like bonus role of Michael Jackson.
7037960	7045560	He was the lead actor in the Advanced System One or AS1 motion simulator game Scramble Training.
7045560	7050320	Apparently, they found the tape at a flea market in the UK.
7050320	7057080	And if you wanted to watch this on YouTube, there was just a shit camcorder 90s shaky thing that was out there.
7057160	7063280	But thanks to finding basically either the master or a direct copy of it at a random flea market in the UK,
7063280	7065800	you can see a direct transfer of the footage.
7066120	7071280	And let's be honest, Michael Jackson, not really known for his acting.
7071640	7075280	Video games at that time, really not known for their acting.
7075440	7079560	You put the two together and you get not so great acting.
7079960	7085440	But it's a piece of video game history that's like, whoa, kind of neat to be seeing this now.
7085680	7086880	Yeah, what's that?
7087440	7087920	Thank you.
7088200	7088720	Thank you.
7091280	7098800	Anyway, and yeah, apparently the guy who had the stuff he was selling at the flea market, he had some Sega merchandise
7098800	7103120	he got from a gentleman whose father a former Sega employee had recently passed away.
7103560	7111120	The the lucky buyer found promo posters, toys, and then apparently a D2 tape he forgot to mention he'd paid a fair bit for.
7111320	7112440	So how about that?
7112960	7114960	Anyway, so that's all over the internet.
7114960	7116840	Now it's available on YouTube.
7116840	7121040	Just look up Michael Jackson and scramble training game does all good if you care.
7121040	7122720	No, it sure doesn't.
7122720	7124520	But, you know, not great.
7124560	7126560	Yeah, but it's one of those things.
7126560	7129640	Again, you know, it's it's very dated technology.
7129640	7130680	It's late 90s.
7130680	7137440	So anyway, but it also loses something, too, because I think it's like one of those motion roller coaster ride things.
7137440	7138760	Yes, yes.
7138760	7141040	So I'm very little bit a little bit.
7141560	7142040	All right.
7142080	7154120	And that brings us to the listener roundtable where every week we invite your questions via our mailbag participate at orange lounge radio.com, as well as our discord server over at vog network.com.
7154120	7156280	That's VOG network.com slash discord.
7156560	7160760	And you can also ask questions in chat if you'd like.
7161080	7163160	I believe we have one email tonight, though.
7163160	7165080	So I'm going to turn it over to dark Sakura.
7166320	7167400	It's a pretty short one.
7168400	7171240	Hi, this is I can't see from Twitch and Discord.
7171640	7182520	As a staunch supporter of cloud gaming, including Stadia, I've noticed that there's this old guard mentality in gaming mentality includes only buying disk based consoles and physical media.
7182760	7189160	They worry about the, quote, all digital future, end quote, and prefer to, quote, own their own games.
7190280	7197880	Because of this, some aspects of modern and future gaming habits are outside of their norm, so they turn up their noses at them.
7198200	7203160	Things like mobile, live service, FTP, and of course, cloud gaming.
7203480	7206800	I won't bring up the two biggest taboo elephants in the room.
7207360	7210400	There's still a demand for ownership and the older ways.
7210520	7214800	How do you think the industry could cater to the old guard while looking to the future?
7216720	7227840	I'm kind of thinking like the limited rent game stuff does, you know, you know, where it becomes like a big collector's item and you get more reward for owning the game.
7227880	7230120	It's a physical copy because it has stuff.
7231600	7244520	Well, first off, thank you for the email I can't see, which I believe as a Stadia fan, I might be jumping to conclusions, but I'm assuming found our show through that YouTube show you did all about Stadia, Dark Sakura, right before they
7245640	7247560	betrayed me and broke my heart.
7247960	7250000	Right before Stadia pulled the plug on everything.
7250000	7251120	So welcome.
7251120	7251760	How dare.
7251760	7253800	Glad we grew our family from that appearance.
7254480	7257000	By the way, all of us available for appearances on other shows.
7257000	7258960	I just did Pokemon Go podcast this week.
7258960	7261080	It's not on their feed yet, or at least it wasn't earlier today.
7261080	7264200	So I haven't linked it anywhere, but I had a good time with them this week.
7264200	7264960	But I digress.
7264960	7265680	Let me get to the email.
7266040	7272360	So I have definitely been of that mindset for a long time that physical copies are more desirable.
7272360	7291760	And the reason why is because I think the used game market and the second hand game market has set up the expectation that you can have some equity in your games, basically some value in your games, especially we've seen how for some older games and some classic games that can really grow.
7291760	7303440	For example, try to get a copy of Suikoden 2 for the PlayStation, at least before they, you know, especially before they or Suikoden 1 or 2 before they did the PS3 download everything even now those games go for a lot.
7303560	7308480	I'm sure Dark Sakura can tell you about some, you know, physical games that go for a lot of money.
7309080	7311320	Just look up Ninja Gaiden trilogy.
7311360	7311720	Yeah.
7311760	7314880	Look up Mighty Final Fight, Final Fight Guy.
7315440	7316960	I own all three of these.
7317800	7334440	Now, while these are old school examples, I think a lot of people kind of hope that maybe if they hang on to their physical libraries, they're going to grow in value at some point, or even if I don't care for the game, I can still turn it around and get $10 back, right?
7334600	7340880	So I think, for me, that's been why I've been tied to physical media for a long time and having that equity.
7341080	7349600	Now, if the value is there to kind of get some of that back in a digital title, then I'm all about digital.
7349600	7357480	And what I mean by that is, look, if you're going to discount the game for 50%, but I get it digitally, I can at least go, okay, well, I only paid half as much for this.
7357680	7360200	So okay, if I can't turn around and sell this back.
7361000	7366480	You asked in the email, how do you think the digital market could maybe gain something with a physical market?
7366480	7375680	I remember a date and time when I think Steam was going to do this, Microsoft was going to do this, but then they got shot down.
7375680	7377240	But that was a different sort of circumstances.
7377240	7384360	But that is put equity in your digital games, make it so that you can turn around and sell your digital games.
7384640	7390720	You might remember this was in Microsoft's original vision for the Xbox One, but it was a little ahead of its time.
7390960	7395040	And I don't think they were clear in the way they communicated a lot of that.
7395320	7400520	And a lot of that got shot down and they were forced to really, you know, do a 180 on that.
7400680	7403640	I just think Don Mattrick was a shitty messenger at the time.
7403840	7418840	And I think could have could have probably done something a lot different with some better messaging of the Xbox One's original vision with that by allowing a system where your digital games, your digital library has equity would have been huge.
7419720	7424200	So I think that would have that would have been a great thing, but it didn't work out that way.
7424200	7426720	Unfortunately, Xbox is in a fine place.
7426720	7428440	Now we got Game Pass and all this other stuff.
7428440	7439480	But, you know, but then I understand your nerves when it comes to things like Game Pass, you know, where movies go, the game industry is going to follow.
7440040	7442400	And so that's why you've got things like Game Pass.
7442400	7444480	And now Sony is following those footsteps.
7444680	7452360	And I kind of I feel like Stadia if they'd offered something along that line, and I guess they did.
7452360	7456640	But again, it wasn't communicated the best way outside of its fan base.
7456720	7460800	You know, if you had the Stadia Pro, you got free games every month, essentially.
7461040	7465960	But it didn't quite have that same feeling of like a library that you tapped into and all this stuff.
7465960	7468880	At least those on the outside weren't seeing it very well.
7468880	7477960	And I think we all know Google, Google kind of stopped supporting that not long after they released it, unfortunately, as far as the marketing standpoint goes, but
7477960	7479640	They announced the closure of Stadia.
7479640	7481880	They said, Oh, we're doing our cloud gaming Chromebook.
7481880	7483880	And everyone was like, Yeah, fuck off.
7484000	7485240	Yeah, right. Yeah.
7485520	7489560	So, um, but so so where does the industry go from here?
7489560	7498560	If a lot of things are going digital, this is exactly why exactly why Diablo four has a $100 collector's edition that doesn't have a copy of the game with it.
7498880	7511800	And as dark soccer pointed out limited run, you know, even with the Netflix, the Hulu's, the Disney pluses, etc, of the world, there is still broadcast television.
7512600	7522120	There is still blu rays, you know, there's still going to be a demand for some of the old guard because broadcast television excels at live TV.
7522280	7527640	I mean, look at what happened when they tried to put Dancing with the Stars on Disney Plus, I think it's lost like half of its viewers.
7527640	7529640	And you can't fault Tyra Banks for all of that.
7529920	7535160	So I think live TV really excels on the traditional broadcast networks, especially news.
7535400	7538560	You can't do news today anyway.
7538800	7544360	Well, they tried look what happened to CNN plus that came in when as fast as it could, right.
7544360	7555520	So anyway, but I do think cloud gaming is also going to be in the future, you know, more and more and I'm not talking like exclusive cloud stuff.
7555520	7559600	I'm talking about games that are in part powered by the cloud.
7560080	7563720	You've heard about, you know, one of Kojima's games, I don't know if it's Death Stranding 2.
7563720	7573080	No, it's not because it's something that's going to be Xbox exclusive, I think, because he was talking about partnering with Microsoft and their cloud is going to be something that probably leverages the cloud.
7573920	7584160	So I sort of think a lot of gaming is going digital, whether you like it or not, I don't think the cloud catches on completely until over the air 5g is accessible in more places.
7584480	7589520	But I think 10 years from now, yeah, you're going to be looking at cloud gaming being a big part of things.
7589800	7602800	How do people get value, either physical trinkets, collector's edition, or somebody figuring out how to develop that system where you can buy and sell digital games, I think is going to be huge for that.
7603360	7605520	So, but the industry is evolving.
7605840	7606400	Hang on.
7606520	7607240	And to agree.
7607680	7608000	Yeah.
7608000	7614480	But there's always I mean, you know, not not to be to be a dead horse, but look at the merchandising.
7614600	7631320	Yeah, it's like the space balls, merchandising, merchandising, okay, because if you go to Target, I remember when I was a kid, you didn't see an aisle full of video game tie ins, video game merchandising when I was a kid.
7631480	7637400	But now you go and there's an aisle that's Fortnite, Minecraft, Five Nights.
7637640	7642000	I mean, a lot of these large games get a lot of merchandising.
7642440	7644360	Heck, the Mario Legos.
7644360	7645440	You know what that is?
7646120	7646880	Merchandising.
7646880	7647720	Merchandising.
7648880	7652480	Super Mario World at Hollywood, Universal Hollywood.
7652480	7653400	You know what that is?
7653800	7656520	An opportunity to sell toilet paper.
7656640	7658640	Super merchandising.
7660160	7662040	So I think you're just going to see a lot of that.
7662040	7667280	But that also just has to do with the fact that the kids are grown up now.
7667920	7668400	Yeah.
7668600	7670960	The kids are grown up now and have kids.
7671240	7673680	Video games is a part of our culture.
7673840	7677360	It's not a fringe thing that nerds do in their basement.
7678240	7683480	There's just as many women as men, if not more, that play video games now.
7683960	7686960	So it's it's a part of our culture.
7686960	7689720	And so the merchandising makes more sense.
7690120	7691520	Because people, yeah.
7692200	7693200	Sorry, Mike Deft.
7693200	7694520	Yes, I got the name wrong in the moment.
7694520	7695920	It's Super Nintendo World.
7696240	7697560	Excuse my beauty.
7698120	7698600	All right.
7699600	7700600	Thank you for the email.
7700600	7702080	I can't see that was a great topic.
7702120	7702720	Appreciate it.
7703720	7704120	All right.
7705040	7708960	If you want to send us an email with a great topic or an average one, that's okay, too.
7708960	7712840	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
7714160	7715720	Also, I saw some comments in chat.
7715720	7717400	So I saw a question in chat here.
7717400	7719640	And if I missed your question, please go ahead and restate it.
7719840	7722960	But She-Hulk10 asked you a question of our panel tonight.
7723160	7725000	What do you guys want for Christmas?
7725360	7728600	Well, Dark Soccer celebrates Hanukkah, but we'll say-
7728600	7729800	I take presents.
7729800	7732240	Yeah, you'll accept Christmas gifts.
7732240	7732680	Sure.
7732680	7734880	Well, I've made it abundantly clear what I want.
7735520	7738520	Steam wallet so I can get Midnight Suns.
7738920	7744240	So what you really want is the hundred dollar Midnight Suns collector's edition.
7744760	7748000	That, well, I mean, because it's the season pass and everything.
7748040	7749280	I mean, that would be nice.
7749280	7751440	But I mean, I'm being realistic.
7751480	7751760	Yeah.
7753360	7754080	Oh, who am I kidding?
7754080	7756880	I'll just use it for RX cells for cosmetics.
7758200	7759120	Dead by daylight.
7762200	7766960	Which is the whole reason I'm bothering with the whole holiday rift right now.
7768640	7770840	Well, I got what I wanted for Christmas.
7770840	7773320	I guess I'll go ahead and tell you all what happened.
7773320	7777400	So Alan and I exchanged gifts a little early this year
7777400	7780000	because he wasn't going to have a way to hide my gift.
7780360	7781920	And it showed up.
7781920	7783560	It was on it was on sale.
7783560	7784800	He had to get it.
7784800	7787520	I just haven't built my Tron arcade machine yet,
7787520	7789760	but it's sitting downstairs waiting to be made.
7789760	7790560	Yep.
7790560	7792000	So it's good.
7792000	7793360	I'm going to have a twin over here,
7793360	7795760	and that's part of the reason why I need to spin my office around.
7796280	7800360	I really wanted to do it this weekend, but I just I I've been a little sore
7800360	7804640	and haven't been able to muster the energy to get all the parts and build them.
7804640	7805920	But that'll be something
7805920	7808360	I really hope I can do with the holiday break that's coming up.
7808480	7812360	So I got what I wanted for Christmas, so I can't complain at all.
7812640	7815920	Otherwise, I guess I would like to get a PlayStation five.
7816120	7816880	But that can wait.
7816880	7819360	That's that's a tall order, and it can wait till early next year.
7819600	7821080	Alan and I are going on a cruise.
7821080	7823400	We're going on the Star Trek cruise again in late February.
7824240	7827720	So I may actually miss two O.L.R.s.
7828760	7829800	No, I don't think I do.
7829800	7833280	No, the the the cruise is Friday to Friday, so I'll be back on a Saturday.
7833280	7835400	So I was like, am I going to miss O.L.R. twice?
7835440	7836920	No, I should only miss it once, actually.
7838880	7842040	So that's coming up and got to save money for that, too.
7842040	7845520	I mean, the cruise is paid for, but, you know, we want spending money.
7845840	7847840	So as you know, Matt says,
7847840	7850280	who are the guests that are slated to be on the cruise this year?
7851680	7853000	Janeway is back.
7853000	7855080	Kate Mulgrew is back this year. That's the big name.
7855280	7858000	I know we get a photo op with a lot of the deep space.
7859000	7859680	They get a lot of that.
7859680	7861600	They have a lot of the deep space nine cast.
7861600	7863640	Both Dax's are there this year.
7866640	7869440	But you ask a good question, not Avery Brooks, Brooks, though,
7869440	7871440	because he doesn't show up to that stuff. What?
7872440	7874960	I need Nicole DeBoer's
7874960	7878880	autograph simply and have it said to the one fan of HyperCube
7878880	7881360	two of HyperCube.
7881360	7882440	She wasn't in HyperCube.
7882440	7883960	She's had the first QQ.
7883960	7885560	I was just say, I love you.
7885560	7887640	But even if it's a little gory, I love the cube.
7887640	7889320	So I thought HyperCube.
7889320	7893000	No, I that's like what I first knew her from.
7893160	7897440	Yeah, same. So I think we do have a photo with the two Dax's
7897440	7899440	because I think it's the one that we get included
7899440	7901320	for preordering the cruise or whatever.
7901320	7903880	So but the only ones we bought
7904760	7906920	the other big name that's going on the cruise this year
7906920	7909320	and we bought the meet and greet with Doug Jones.
7909320	7912400	We had to. We had to. So.
7912800	7917040	Well, another thing, too, is that I first knew
7917640	7920120	Terry Farrell from Hellraiser three.
7920560	7922840	Oh, that's a good one.
7922840	7925640	I mean, the movie wasn't great, but that's what I knew her from.
7927360	7930760	So Doug Jones is the other big name.
7930760	7935880	But we also got a meet and greet with Brent Spiner because we didn't.
7936240	7939520	He was on the last cruise, but we didn't get a picture with him or whatever.
7939520	7940880	For whatever reason, last time,
7940880	7943840	I feel like we ought to buy a meet and greet with Denise Crosby,
7943840	7946640	just because the more I see her, the more I love her.
7946640	7948720	I just like she was such a highlight of the last cruise.
7948720	7951360	So anyway, all those folks are going on the cruise this year.
7951360	7952200	And let's see.
7952200	7955880	Jonathan Frakes is the other like big name because he wasn't on the year we went.
7958280	7960520	Let's see who else is on this year.
7960520	7962240	There's a lot of people.
7962240	7964920	You can go to Star Trek, the cruise dot com if you want to see the full list.
7965160	7966960	Robert Duncan McNeil is making it this year.
7966960	7969400	He didn't make the other Voyager year we went.
7969680	7972720	Michelle Heard from the Picard series, just Bush from Picard
7973240	7974600	are both going this year as well.
7974600	7976520	So, yeah, it's a good it's a good list.
7976960	7979920	But I'm just honestly like celebs are one thing.
7980160	7981200	I love the people.
7981200	7982760	Part of the reason I love the starter crews.
7982760	7984640	I'm a dirty casual when it comes to track.
7984640	7986240	OK, I haven't seen every series.
7986240	7988040	I try, but I just haven't.
7988040	7989440	I'm not up to date on everything.
7989440	7991560	Here's the thing. It's a great crowd.
7991560	7994640	It's 30, 40 and 50 something nerds.
7995240	7997400	Shatner is not there this year, thank God.
7997560	8000200	So I expect most of the crowd will be a little more progressive.
8000440	8001600	Here's and here's the thing.
8001600	8004680	Not that I care about a person's political leanings totally,
8004720	8006120	but here's the thing.
8006120	8009240	If Alan and I hold hands on the boat, nobody gives a shit.
8009480	8012600	Unfortunately, the reality is most cruises, that's not the case.
8013200	8018240	You get a you get a boomer population that still kind of lives in old times
8018920	8020680	and has some old ways of thinking.
8020680	8024640	So that's part of the reason I like going on the Star Trek cruise, quite frankly.
8024800	8027240	And I don't I don't want to go on a gay cruise because
8028440	8032080	gay cruises oftentimes are one of two things.
8033080	8036320	They're floating circuit parties, which I'm not interested in,
8036920	8040720	or they're all lesbians with kids, which is great for that audience.
8041320	8043080	Not what I'm looking for in a cruise.
8043080	8045760	I'm looking for the nerd cruise. Perfect for me.
8046720	8050680	So anyway, Loki, we did not get your what do you want for Christmas?
8050680	8052520	Going back to She-Hulk's question.
8052520	8055920	Oh, I don't know. A few hundred subscribers on YouTube.
8057200	8058800	Oh, yeah, I'd like that on Twitch, please.
8058800	8061520	It's a fair ask. We want that for VOG Network, too.
8061920	8065240	Hint hint. So, of course, everyone here, I assume, is already following.
8065240	8068160	If you're not, though, consider it. Thank you.
8068160	8070760	All right. Great questions.
8070760	8073720	Let's see, looking in chat for some other questions.
8073720	8076040	I don't see any, but I do want to mention this.
8076040	8079520	So we are going to be doing a show next week, probably a shorter show,
8079520	8082000	but we're going to be here. Next week is Christmas Day.
8082000	8083960	We don't expect you all are going to be here.
8083960	8085800	However, Bobby Black Wolf will be back.
8085800	8087880	He will be on that night and will be here as well.
8088280	8091920	We're going to open up the floor to further questions.
8091920	8094640	I know we don't always get a lot at the end of the show.
8094640	8098520	However, we're going to format the show for December 25th
8098520	8101240	a little bit like we did the 20th anniversary show.
8101480	8103840	We're going to format it a little bit more like a panel
8104000	8105720	where we're going to answer your questions.
8105720	8107800	And your questions can be about gaming.
8107800	8109760	They can be about podcasting.
8109760	8114960	They can be about life lessons, whatever you want to ask about within reason.
8115280	8117680	DJ Rama S says the return of Ask Orange Lounge?
8117680	8121680	Pretty much. So whatever you want to ask, within reason.
8121680	8122960	This is not Dr. Ruth.
8122960	8125640	OK, but as long as I mean, at the same time,
8125640	8127160	we could try to fake her accent.
8129160	8132320	I would I would blur the line of being offensive if I tried to do that.
8132320	8134640	So I don't know, but I love Dr. Ruth too.
8134880	8138720	But anyway, I will create a thread and discord after the show.
8138720	8139360	If you would like to.
8139360	8142000	I was trying to do it during the show, and then I realized, oops,
8142320	8145760	Loki and Dark Sakura's faces go away when I switch screens on discord.
8145960	8149440	I will make a thread on in the Orange Lounge radio channel on discord
8149440	8152280	after the show for you to submit your questions for consideration.
8152280	8154600	We probably won't get to everything, but we'll try.
8154600	8156880	So we look forward to seeing you next week.
8158040	8161520	With that, let me check with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.
8162520	8164200	Oh, I thought so.
8164200	8165320	It's probably a little bit.
8165320	8168520	The next two weeks going to be a little slower, and that's OK.
8168840	8171080	I should say this is going to be the format of the show
8171080	8174840	for the next two weeks, because I anticipate between Christmas and New Year's.
8175360	8178760	It's going to be a lot of the best games of 2022.
8178760	8180040	And we can talk about that as well.
8180040	8183640	But it's not going to be a lot of new news coming out that week.
8183640	8185400	Maybe it may be a little bit.
8185400	8189360	But we can always do like we know the news is good.
8190000	8192280	We always used to do like our top games.
8192280	8195080	And then we also did like predictions as well.
8195240	8196840	Oh, we need to bring that back.
8196840	8198280	I agree. Let's do predictions.
8198280	8201320	We'll do that on January 1st. That'd be fun.
8201320	8203960	As you know, Matt says, we do have our predictions of 2022 to get to.
8203960	8206160	No, we don't. We never did them
8206160	8208320	because of the whole virtual situation.
8208880	8212000	And always we're doing something else, which is nothing. Yeah.
8212120	8213440	So we'll we'll mix it up.
8213440	8215640	We don't have a robot sitting on the desk anymore
8216200	8220400	because who could have predicted covid, but we'll we'll do this.
8222960	8227320	All right. Anyhow, on that note, let's wrap it up for tonight.
8227320	8230200	We'll go around and get folks final thoughts and then we'll be done for tonight.
8230720	8234240	Dara Sakura, I'm assuming you are doing a post show tonight
8234240	8236120	with some Debbie Delight.
8236120	8239840	I am. Gwen is as Gwen and I are already partied up
8239840	8242200	and we have room for two more to join us.
8243440	8244880	If I didn't have to edit,
8244880	8247600	I didn't have to edit or get all that done, plus I smell dinner.
8247600	8250720	So there'll be time later than that.
8250960	8252760	We'll see. We'll see. All right.
8252760	8255960	And we're going to just go around
8255960	8258000	and jump in snowmen and be ridiculous.
8258360	8259480	Sounds like fun.
8259480	8262240	Do you have a final look on my Twitter for my Megamis pictures?
8262760	8264560	Do you have a final thought for us tonight?
8264560	8267680	I was my final thought. Oh, OK.
8267680	8272080	Come come play with us and and and and and and give me a dollar.
8273720	8275720	All right. Bye, Dara.
8275720	8278640	Hi, look, Loki, your final thought tonight.
8280160	8283800	My final thought is I must still be working on content creation some more.
8284800	8286240	It sounds good.
8286240	8287720	It's going to be all life.
8287720	8291160	Yeah, I I definitely want to leverage more tick tock.
8291160	8294320	It's just about finding that right thing to talk about
8294320	8295600	that I'm very passionate about.
8295600	8298440	So and just, you know, sitting down and doing it right.
8298480	8301560	It's it's it's it's harder than you think it really is.
8302440	8306240	Yeah. Otherwise, my final thought, I don't I don't know.
8306240	8308880	Just I hope everybody out there has a good holiday.
8309560	8313200	If you are the Hanukkah celebrating sword, I hope you have a good holiday.
8313240	8315120	It's starting off well for you.
8315120	8317080	If you're the solstice sword, I hope you have a good way.
8317080	8320000	You know, even if Christmas sort out, just have a great holiday.
8320000	8321000	Thank you for being here.
8321000	8323000	Thank you for making us a part of your weekly routine.
8323000	8328600	I'm just very grateful that we're still here going into our 21st year next year.
8329240	8333680	If you can believe it from 2002 to 2023, it'll be our 21st year next year.
8334040	8335000	Old enough to drink.
8335000	8337840	I kind of can't believe it, but it is what it is.
8337840	8339880	So thank you so much for being a part of it.
8339880	8341600	That's it. That's all I have to say.
8341600	8343160	Have a wonderful week, everybody.
8343160	8345280	Happy holiday. Happy December.
