00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Early into the debut of Apple Arcade, an Oregon Trail remaster came out. My two second review? It was well made. I'm a huge fan of the classic Apple II Oregon Trail as well as the first Windows 95 version. The decade since brought a Super Ragon Adventure and Oregon Trail, the one with zombies, and now we're back to palatable edutainment. Yes, my gravestone still says pepperoni and cheese.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is your Westward Frontier update. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live here with you tonight on November the 6th of 2022 with episode number 936 of our show.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my co host here every week to talk about video games and all that good stuff. Joining me say hello to Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hey, I think my webcam died.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, I was gonna say we don't see you on cam, but that's all right. Things happen. We'll do it live. That's the joys of taping live because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network. Nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackall show.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Camo works now.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't even know what that is. What's camo?

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's the one that I use to use my phone as my camera.

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Camo works, that's why I don't see her.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Dark Soccer used camouflage. It's super effective. Jokes like that and more brought to you by Loki. Hi, Loki.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's right. I'm here.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You are wearing dad flannel making dad jokes. What's that dad game playing in the background behind you tonight?

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Burnout Paradise.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, good.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I couldn't think of anything.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No, it's a good pick. Why not? I like that. Dark Soccer. I see your Zoltar shirt tonight. It's pretty cool. I like that.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, the shirt that got a cease and desist delivered to coin up game room.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, I didn't know about that.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, mine. Mine has a stand up a little bit. You can see.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, okay. I see it has actual logo on it. Okay.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah. So it was given to me gifted.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Nice. Well, Dark Soccer, I see your friend who you've brought up on the show previously.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Fanara is in chat saying you may get dysentery, I believe, commenting on Jason's intro tonight, which we'll get to later.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But it is it is lovely to see Fanara in chat. It looks like that means she's doing better. I hope that means so.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I think that she's incrementally better as far as I understand.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So but she'd have to answer that herself.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Fair enough.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I've been I've talked to my mother yesterday.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How is she doing?

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
She sounded really bad, but she was in good spirits. It was her 64th birthday.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, happy birthday.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Your mom's the oldest Madonna.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Just an observation. That's all Madonna is also 64.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, at any rate, she sounded she she sounded in good spirits.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They think that they're figuring out how to beat the pneumonia.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And she actually says she could take some deeper breaths today.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, good.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So I'm hoping that.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Fingers crossed, you know, but I'm still doing my marathon.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I was just about to ask you're doing a marathon, right?

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, I'm not going to be able to do a whole lot of talking, of course.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So, wow, it let me in to co-host right away.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I just immediately signed up and immediately got in.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh, the Twitter clone co-host?

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Caitlin, let's watch your tangent train focus.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, no, I try.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I had forgotten to sign up, so I just went ahead and did it.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I thought I'd have to wait, but no, I guess I'm special.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But anyway, I'm going to be playing Dead by Daylight for 12 hours.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I might, you know, take a break and do Cult of the Lamb or something,

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
but it's all to raise money for my mom's hospital bill.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
She is completely uninsured.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is Alabama.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She's had some pretty expensive work and treatment done to her.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So, you know, I just don't want to do what I can to help out my mom.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And for those in chat, I'll link the GoFundMe.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But, you know, if you can make it, it'll be from 12 o'clock p.m. Pacific to 12 midnight.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
However else long I decide to go if I have energy for it or a voice.

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I probably don't have the voice for it.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But, yeah, I'd appreciate some support even if you just, you know, show up and say hi.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And speaking of my voice, as you can hear, it's coming and going, but it's getting incrementally better.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I just have to take it easy.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm glad to hear it's getting better.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I was going to point out, too, we're actually not going to be here with Orange Lounge Radio.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And actually Bobby isn't here either just for like we all have kind of random reasons that we're all not available.

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So it's well, I think Loki's here, but everybody else has some type of commitment next weekend.

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So because you're in a Dead by Daylight tournament or something, right?

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I thought that was next Sunday for you.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't know why.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm not in a tournament at all.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I didn't sign up for it.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why did I think that?

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All right, whatever.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But I'm not here next Sunday because it would be fun.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, maybe that's maybe my brain is subconsciously telling you to sign up for one.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't know.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But I won't be here next weekend.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm going on a personal vacation.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So Alan and I will be up in Seattle.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Bobby's actually not going to be here next weekend either.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He's doing a personal vacation of sorts as well.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So say hi to our mutual friends up there.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
For sure.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Can't wait to see some folks up there.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Actually, we did reach out to the streamer that you and I both know that lives up there.

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But they're unavailable.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So they're also in town.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, I know the same reason.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So, yeah.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Anyway, let's move on and get into tonight's kickoff topic.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's talk about some things that are going on in gaming with you all in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Fanara did give an update saying still breathing, but COVID-borne potato brain.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Sorry to hear it.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hopefully, hopefully it gets sorted out sooner rather than later and doesn't doesn't stick around too terribly long.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
All right.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's get into some gaming updates.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We'll go over to Loki to start us off tonight with some pretty big, long awaited updates that I would have thought would have had their own press conference or Nintendo Direct style video.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But no press release Monday morning.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Here we go.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Right.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yep.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
OK.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Sony has finally announced or unveiled to the world more details about the PlayStation VR to mean when we're going to get it and how much it's going to cost.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's expensive.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's going to be five hundred and fifty dollars.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's going to release in February.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And they were talking about that the bundle is going to include Horizon, Call of the Mountain and also include a spin.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I guess.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, I think that's it.

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It just includes that they're going to have 11 other games that are going to be coming out for it or ports that are set the release during the first year.

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So we've got looks like Crossfire, Sierra Squad, the Light Brigade, Cities VR enhanced edition.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Cosmonia is high.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Hello, neighbors.

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Search and rescue.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Man, that game is like.

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Changed Jurassic World Aftermath Collection, Pistol Whip VR, Zenith, the last city after the fall tent clear.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And my personal favorite, the dark picture is switchback VR, which is a spiritual successor to Until Dawn Rush of Blood.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You know, I'm all about that.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So, yeah, when I saw that, I was like, oh, Loki got his wish.

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I got my wish.

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Congratulations.

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's all.

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That always feels good when the game makers grant your wish.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah.

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Although it isn't I mean, it isn't until dawn.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But, you know, I guess it wouldn't.

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's fine.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't really care.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's a spiritual successor.

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's not, you know, there really is.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I didn't like that until dawn.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So it's fine.

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm totally on board with it being something different.

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't know what the dark picture I think is that dark picture is like there.

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Overarching like universe.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I think so.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But then you have things like the quarry that didn't get branded into that.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But there were other games that were in that.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So I think it's I think it's like one of their multiverses.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Basically, the dark pictures makes me think of like that thing that Universal is trying to do with like the new Mummy movie.

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh, no.

151
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And this is what PlayStations got.

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's way more popular.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I know that.

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's just like I hear that.

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And I was like, how does this tie in with the Mummy?

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The Invisible Man.

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Honestly, that's the approach maybe the Universal should take for that whole thing is make it a gaming universe.

158
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Wouldn't that be something be better than that Tom Cruise?

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The only way the Mummy is going to get better is to bring Brendan Fraser back.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's that's the reality.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I guess.

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah.

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But yeah, I'm very excited to see that.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The rest of the I don't really care.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But let me let me piggyback on that.

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So are you saying that like you're sold on PSVR, too, just so you can play that one game?

167
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Or are you kind of like, no, that's a lot of money.

168
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm just hoping that if I wait long enough, they'll just port the PC, please.

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's that's that's a lot of that's a lot of cash for one game.

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I'm not dropping that kind of cash for one game.

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I do as much as I like to see it.

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I do really want a PSVR, too, eventually.

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm not I mean, again, I'm not quite sold that any of these launch titles are like need to have for me.

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But I'll kind of wait and see how the, you know, early reception is to it.

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And, you know, kind of what the what social media ability because, my God, like, it's just going to be scalped up to hell.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And yeah, that worries me, too.

177
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I just mean, it could be 20, 24.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We're looking into being able to get something like this.

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, and even then, it's what else did they put out?

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let me put it this way. Shane sent me a text and was like, hey, are you getting a PSVR, too?

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm like, no, I'm not going to buy one right away. I don't have a PS5 still.

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He's like, great. Can I use your sign up to get an extra chance?

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's like, sure. I'm like, but actually, honestly, if I do if I do get in there to get a PlayStation PSVR, too.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's not a very intelligent system because it should know I have never played on a PlayStation five.

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Like, hey, they would know I never bought bought a PS5 for them.

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Sure, I could have got one from Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon, you know, one of the other many places selling a PS5.

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But they should still be able to know I have never logged into a PlayStation five.

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm trying to think even like when I played PlayStation five at other people's houses, like in Bobby's theater and stuff,

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I didn't log into my own account or anything. I don't remember doing that. I'm confident.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't think I would have done that. There's no reason to.

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So it's not going to they should know I've never touched a PS5. They shouldn't sell me one of these.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So it's going to be really funny if I get an invite and he doesn't.

193
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm just going to have to wait, you know, and see what happens with it.

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I mean, it's like I said, you know, that's that's too much money for one game.

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There needs to be like more to bring me to it. And I need that Tetris effect style game.

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I mean, I do love No Man's Sky. I didn't love playing it in VR for an extended period of time because I start to get like the eye pull and like the.

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But I'm wondering if the advances in technology are going to help with a lot of that, because I just I really want to just also like try the technology.

198
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah. So I'm kind of I'm I'm super curious to see how like something like No Man's Sky, which they're not just remember, they're they're technically calling it a PSVR to release.

199
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It is separate from what they did for, you know, the original PSVR.

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So I'm just kind of curious to see what they do with it, because I did enjoy playing No Man's Sky in VR, but just not for very long.

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah. I mean, there's like some of the other games that they're showing off, like Tentacular looks funny.

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You're like a giant octopus thing. The Horizon spinoff looks really looks really good.

203
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah. I mean, that looks good. I don't know. Cities VR could be cool, I guess.

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They need to get Mizuguchi to do something for it if they are already. I would be very surprised if to see Mizuguchi is not making some.

205
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And of course, that's the mind behind Tetris Effect. But going back to Rez, you know, some of the other classic games, a lot of the old classic Sega titles, I would really hope he's making something for PSVR, too.

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, hey, what about that Rez thing that we, you know, we were teased with, you know?

207
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, what? Area X, which very clearly is a prototype for a sequel to Rez, for a Rez 2 or a new Rez game.

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Area X, if you watch the credits for Area X, you will, I know I've brought this up on the show before, but it's not like I haven't repeated myself before.

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm going to remind everybody, if you actually watch the credits, you see at the very end, Area X is powered by the synesthesia engine.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And if you actually watch the Tetris Effect credits, it's powered by the same engine. So they built that engine to make games in.

211
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And I really think Rez was, like Area X was supposed to be its own game, which is a bummer it wasn't fully realized because I love Area X and the music is so good in the Rez.

212
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And this was the Rez, what, Rez VR, but they also, I think they released it in non-VR spaces as well, I want to say, because you can play Area X without being in VR.

213
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah, Rez HD or something like that.

214
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, Rez HD. Sorry, they've re-released Rez so many times now, I forget what the different ones are differentiated, but the latest one that they did.

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And the VR one was pretty awesome. It was fun to play it in VR. It's just, yeah, it would be cooler to see something, you know, it's kind of showing its age a little bit.

216
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, a little bit, you know, it's a great game, but it's...

217
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
How about Justice for Child of Eden? You know, that game kind of came and went and it wasn't bad.

218
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I liked that one a lot. I thought that was a really great game. And it kind of reminds me a lot of the Tetris Effect type stuff where they had a lot of that kind of earthy, you know, imagery and stuff like that with Child of Eden.

219
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I would love to see Mizuguchi to get a really strong license. Oh, I guess. And honestly, he did with Tetris. I mean, Tetris is a huge license, but I think he and his, you know, builders have really proved themselves with that.

220
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Like I think of, do you remember when Xbox Connect launched one of the early games they had for it? This might have been Xbox One, the line's a little blurry, but was the Fantasia thing? Disney Fantasia was the thing that they had on it?

221
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah, that was Connect.

222
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Can you imagine if Mizuguchi had like a Disney license to make a Disney game in VR? That would be phenomenal. So I would love to see him get a huge like, I mean, of course, he makes great originals too.

223
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So I can't say like, oh, you know, I'm not gonna be excited about whatever that guy makes next. But I would love for him to get a big, big license to play with besides Tetris, which honestly is already a big license, I guess.

224
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So there is that. I think they will make a Tetris effect too as well. I think they have to. So yeah, we'll see. I just hope you know that.

225
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The Switchback VR comes out on PC. I do see like some of the stuff that they're talking about, though, that like, and this is some of the things I and I sort of got it from the trailer and I'm not entirely sure.

226
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So the with the PlayStation VR has the head tracking. Remember? Yeah, it has your eye tracking. Yep. So unlike, you know, that one scene in Until Dawn Rush of Blood, because there's a lot of stuff that's obviously in this trailer that they've done before with the mannequins where it will basically the mannequins will move if you don't look at them.

227
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But this one, it'll like they'll move if you blink your eyes. Oh, man. So they're weeping angels. Yeah, that's scary. I want to play this game so bad.

228
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Prince Peach Fuzz is in our chat. Hi, I haven't seen that name in a while. Hope you're well, says I'm surprised they didn't call it the PS VR slim. Cute name. And it is that is one attractive thing about it. It's way less wires and way less bullshit for your living room.

229
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Game changer. So it is a slim but remember it and this is a big reason why you know, we talked about why don't the PS VR games just work on PS VR to it's because it's it's really rebuilt places VR and it's low key was saying it's a different type of tracking. It's not tracking through the camera anymore. Like you know, the original one was it's not using like the moves this red and blue dots. It's it's completely built different when it Yeah, it's inside out tracking. It's like completely different so they wouldn't be able to port. And they could be a little bit different.

230
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:57,000
They could probably you could remake your games, I guess using that tracking, but it wouldn't be something that they could just say, Oh, there's gonna be backwards compatibility with these that would be very difficult for them to do.

231
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,480
Fanara is in chat saying dreamlight Valley VR dropkick Donald, I think that would be a Kingdom Hearts VR heal me son of a bitch. All right.

232
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,840
This is their Kingdom Hearts VR game.

233
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:17,680
I think it was like a spin off. It wasn't like an actual mainline. But you know how there's you know, Kingdom Hearts VR 36 over to Jupiter.

234
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,360
For matching service

235
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,600
for matching service featuring true kids destination.

236
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,720
I thought that they had like it was either a Kingdom Hearts or it was like a Final Fantasy. I thought they had a VR thing.

237
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,160
There was Bobby says it was an experience, not a game.

238
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,800
Well, right. They're all experiences. That's that's the thing that sucked to like what was it?

239
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,560
There was there was a Utada Hikaru experience where you just watch them sing a song.

240
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:55,960
Yeah, there was that one game because so this is the best part. And this would be my hope if the PlayStation VR to it. I hope it comes with this.

241
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,680
Like, don't get me wrong, like,

242
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:13,880
it's expensive. But one of the things I liked about the first one was it came with that demo disk. And I understand that we're past the age of demo disk. But come on, like, let's just indulge us a little bit. Like

243
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,280
give me access to the demo cloud.

244
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,240
No, no, no. That got me that got me by for like such a long time because it had

245
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,640
it had that first stage of Until Dawn Rush of Blood, which is fantastic.

246
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,200
I mean, not that you wouldn't just buy it anyways, because it's like 20 bucks.

247
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,000
It was just such a stupid like.

248
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,520
Such an easy decision to make.

249
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,200
But they had that it had like,

250
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,640
you know, I'm assuming they're going to do something with like playroom with this that'll probably be free as well.

251
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,840
Or maybe AstroBots, which might not be free.

252
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,800
And then, God, there was this like flight sim game.

253
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,440
That was pretty awesome.

254
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,200
But it was an experience.

255
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,480
And so like it was like getting good.

256
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,720
And it's just, oh, and fade black.

257
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,960
And I guess that's how the actual game was, too.

258
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,040
So I'm hoping that we get some longer experiences now that,

259
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:14,560
you know, this system can run Unreal five and it can run more powerful things.

260
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,440
And so I'm curious to see what they come out with.

261
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,320
Prince Peach Fuzz in chat says Wii Sports was fantastic.

262
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,280
And it was basically a demo disk, right?

263
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,080
Well, Nintendo is so good at packaging their tech demos into like games like what was one,

264
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,840
one to switch was just that is nothing but a tech demo compilation.

265
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,560
Yeah, that didn't work out so well for them once you switch.

266
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,160
But then they tried it again.

267
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,040
I mean, they feel like more people bought that than probably should have.

268
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,880
But yeah, Wii Sports, they tried to do it again with Wii Play and even tried to like,

269
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,480
well, we'll give you a controller and Wii remote plus with that.

270
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,480
Oh, yeah, I remember that thing where made the controller like five feet long.

271
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,160
And then there, but Wii Fit was a runaway success.

272
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,520
Yeah, Wii Fit balance boards that are stacked up at your local, you know,

273
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,800
your local trade in store

274
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,760
thrift store, you know, it's just like, hey,

275
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,440
there will be a renaissance when they try to find a plastic guitar now.

276
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,280
That was the joke. Five years ago. Try to find one now.

277
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,200
They're not easy to find anymore because, you know, you go to the store there.

278
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,280
Oh, you got to be not being the great may not be in the greatest

279
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,440
like DJ Hero Controller is like crazy.

280
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,280
They're like seriously all the time.

281
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,040
Interesting, but they may not be in the greatest shape,

282
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,200
but you just buy a few of them and swap parts around and you get work in one.

283
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,480
I want to read some other comments in chat.

284
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,440
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I think it was smart for them to announce this,

285
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,480
especially the price in this blog post.

286
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,280
We all knew the price was going to sting, dropping the price in a blog,

287
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,920
soften the blow and avoided a possible five hundred and ninety nine

288
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,680
U.S. dollars moment when that's like what they're asking.

289
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,280
It's only five hundred fifty U.S. dollars.

290
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,400
But well, they are selling a horizon bundle that is five hundred and ninety

291
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,360
nine U.S. dollars.

292
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,160
So there is that. But oh, it's not free.

293
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,440
I thought that was just included.

294
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,960
Oh, at least that's not the impression I got.

295
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,640
Of course. Am I wrong?

296
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,000
The company that charges seventy dollars for the Horizon Party games.

297
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Yeah, let's see.

298
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,640
There was another good comment.

299
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,080
Oh, she helped ten said, Is it compatible with Pornhub?

300
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,640
You know, you laugh, you joke.

301
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,400
Well, maybe you don't.

302
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,160
But I say a lot of people would say that with tongue firmly planted in cheek.

303
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,120
But a lot of times the winning media format is chosen by the porn industry.

304
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,960
And certainly pornography exists in VR, at least on PC.

305
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,120
Is does the PlayStation five have a web browser?

306
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,520
Because I don't think that they do.

307
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,920
They I don't know. That's a question for chat.

308
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,120
Just chat. No, just PlayStation five have a web browser

309
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,680
because Xbox Series X still has Edge built in.

310
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,800
So there's that Microsoft.

311
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
I know, but I'm just saying it's not like they

312
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,200
they all got rid of them with the current generation of consoles.

313
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,560
I just thought they wouldn't because like, you know, well, so it opens them up for

314
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,200
all for having Sony.

315
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,040
Just remember, Sony does not allow adults

316
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,440
only rated content because that's why the ESRB exists. Right.

317
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,440
So if your game is really rated adults only, you can't sell it

318
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,560
officially on the Sony platform in the marketplace or anything like that.

319
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,800
In fact, all the all the big game companies have that same rule.

320
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,280
Got to go to PC and Steam.

321
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,160
Yeah, you got to go to PC and Steam if you end up with that rating.

322
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:33,120
So would there be officially sanctioned porn on PlayStation VR, too?

323
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,040
No. But what Loki is alluding to is there

324
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,840
if there was a web browser, could we get porn? Of course.

325
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,440
Bobby Blackwell says the PlayStation five has the ability to show

326
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,200
and interact with web pages.

327
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,640
But I can't remember if you can access the web browser directly

328
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,560
and give it a URL.

329
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,440
Well, I'm sure if if porn is involved.

330
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,680
Somebody will figure it out.

331
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,200
Bet. All right, let's move on

332
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,480
and talk about our gaming weeks, porn games or otherwise,

333
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,520
but I'm thinking everybody had a pretty PG rated week, but we'll see.

334
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,360
So let's go around and check out in on our gaming weeks.

335
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,760
Dark Soccer will start with you. How was your gaming week?

336
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,520
It was all right.

337
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,400
I played Dead by Daylight.

338
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,960
I played Final Fantasy five.

339
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,760
I am now on the next map of the game.

340
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,000
Cult of the Lamb, some pinball.

341
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,120
Played a little word scapes and kind of pissed off at them, though.

342
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,880
But mostly that.

343
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,440
And I've also taken up playing with 3D rendering software now.

344
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,000
So. Just. Just.

345
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,240
The usual. Actually, we picked up our Genesis

346
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,440
two mini arrived today.

347
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,360
We haven't hooked it up yet, but we got it.

348
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,960
And we're talking about getting the import. So.

349
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,520
Nice. It's little is very little.

350
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,040
All right. Well, let's go over to Loki.

351
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,400
How was your week?

352
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:15,120
Well, I tried to play different things, so I dusted off the literally

353
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,680
dusted off the DDR machine

354
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,880
to play some step mania.

355
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,840
And apparently something is up with the computer that I have in it.

356
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,960
It keeps crashing on me, which no, it's fine. It's fine.

357
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,640
I mean, it it's not the actual 573 board that's in there that that's

358
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,080
that's disconnected.

359
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,600
It's running off an actual PC right now.

360
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,560
It's still annoying. I don't know what's wrong with it.

361
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,120
There's not many parts to it.

362
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,800
It's like it's literally a NVMe

363
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,720
SSD card on a motherboard with a tiny bit of RAM and an APO.

364
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,720
So it's one of those probably didn't like being in the garage for years

365
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,400
in the, you know, the dam, the damp winters and the hot summers.

366
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,840
So it could be something minor.

367
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,800
It may even be just like the fact that the way I turn the machine on and off,

368
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,000
there's not like a way to like, you know, exit windows type thing.

369
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,560
You have to just hard turn it off most of the time.

370
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,000
And that can cause

371
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,480
file issues. The first crash I had on it was a it was like a graphics driver crash.

372
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,440
So I'm going to try a few things, but I may have to end up replacing that,

373
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,720
which is fine. I can go back to the actual arcade

374
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,680
and run that instead of step mania.

375
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,120
But, you know, I was just trying to trying to dust it off and.

376
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,160
Exercise like you should.

377
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,720
But yeah, so I did play

378
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,800
I played two and a half songs before it finally crashed the last time.

379
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,960
So there is that.

380
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,960
And then, of course, Minecraft is working on stuff this week.

381
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,840
I've put out an episode earlier today, though that's out there now

382
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,960
starting to get the robot masters in there now,

383
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,080
because if you don't know, I've been building in a Mega Man theme.

384
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,680
So we're having I'm creating eight unique robot masters for my series.

385
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,640
And so the first one, Creeper Man's got his

386
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,920
area being built out.

387
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,360
So I built a giant tree from a game I have not played yet.

388
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,600
Mega Man zero two.

389
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,640
It's I'm going to try to pronounce it because it's like Norse.

390
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,000
I think it's Yggdrasil.

391
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,720
Oh, yeah. And it's the tree of life.

392
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,360
And it's World Tree.

393
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,400
Yes, the World Tree.

394
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,200
So in, I guess, that game once again, haven't played it, don't know the lore.

395
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,720
I think I guess X has like trapped a dark elf.

396
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,160
I don't know where dark elves come for the Mega Man series,

397
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,120
but apparently there's dark elves now.

398
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,240
And so I based it sort of on that.

399
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,720
It's not exact one to one, but I just was kind of inspired by it

400
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,400
to make something. So I have that.

401
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,120
And then I've got some more designs being done.

402
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,160
I have three robot masters done right now.

403
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
There's one more being designed right now.

404
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,040
And then I'm getting 3D models made of them to put them in game.

405
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,960
So I have the first two of those almost done.

406
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,040
I've seen those, the finished models for them.

407
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,000
And I'm very excited to have them walking around.

408
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,160
My base is going to be awesome.

409
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,600
So that's in there as well.

410
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,320
But yeah, just be continued on building more stuff, of course, and

411
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,280
putting out more content.

412
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm going to try to get some more YouTube shorts going.

413
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,960
I put a rendered one today.

414
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,560
I'm going to keep adding some more in there to try to boost the channel

415
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,280
because YouTube loves it.

416
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,240
Leverage those shorts on TikTok.

417
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,560
Alan started loading his Twitch clips to TikTok using some website,

418
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,760
and he's getting way more views on those than I would ever have thought.

419
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,840
TikTok is like pushing that stuff.

420
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,920
So yeah, Instagram too.

421
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Yeah, the Instagram stories and stuff like that.

422
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,120
Bog Network has a TikTok now.

423
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,200
We haven't leveraged it for anything yet, but the ideas are cooking.

424
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,240
So here we go.

425
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,480
OK, let's see.

426
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,480
So I was just looking in chat at some of the other folks gave me weeks.

427
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,400
Tiger Claw was suggesting the power supply.

428
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,160
I don't know if you saw that.

429
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,000
I don't think it's the power supply.

430
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,400
I mean, it could be, but if it was the power supply,

431
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,320
you would think that it wouldn't just crash after a little bit.

432
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,120
It is running and like the power supply.

433
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,240
I think it's fine.

434
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,880
It could be, but typically if it's a power supply, it just wouldn't turn on.

435
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,720
Not just like crash randomly.

436
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,200
And the power supply is way over like it's like a

437
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,280
I think it's like a 430 watt power supply.

438
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,800
And it's only running like an APU with like nothing.

439
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,200
Like it's just it's it's way too much for what it actually needs.

440
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,640
So I don't think it's going to be an issue there.

441
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,120
But more likely, it's either why I think might have happened.

442
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,600
It could be a heat issue where the cooling

443
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,240
and expanding of the thing might have like

444
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,560
I may need to tighten down the the heat sink on the CPU.

445
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,720
It could be just I need to reload step mania again.

446
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,080
I have to boot it up outside of step mania and see if it crashes

447
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,640
after like a little bit of time because it didn't take long for the crash.

448
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,400
So if it crashes outside of step mania, I know it's something not related to that.

449
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,320
And I just have to check like,

450
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,320
you know, are there any file errors and stuff like that?

451
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,000
It could be something not a lot of parts to replace on that.

452
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,440
So it should be pretty easy to fix that.

453
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,400
There's other ideas in chat there.

454
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,880
Look, if you want to take a picture, I'm talking about machines.

455
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,840
I'll get into my gaming week.

456
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,520
So I went over to round one in Roseville real quick.

457
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,080
It was just really like run in and run out.

458
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,120
I was trying to get a new EMU's card

459
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,760
because I couldn't find my old one, which is so irritating.

460
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,680
I thought for sure once I bought a new one, the old one would pop up.

461
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,200
But it still hasn't yet.

462
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,320
But I went over there and they had the brand new 2DX resident or,

463
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,200
you know, which 2DX 30th style for us old school fans.

464
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,240
But, you know, they give them all actual names now.

465
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,480
So I got to see a little bit of that.

466
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
And, you know, some of the other games that they had there, we were just

467
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,880
we were really just in and out of there for like two seconds,

468
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,080
because then we went over to.

469
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,240
So this is a newer friend of mine who really follows like all these

470
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,720
Bamani and music games and, you know, has is a private collector,

471
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,680
went over to another friend's house out in that area

472
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,680
who is also a private collector, small world.

473
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,920
Somebody I met once with dark soccer

474
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,000
and I texted you the details like 12 years ago,

475
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,360
went over to this person's house and this person was setting up

476
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,000
their brand new you beat machine that they just got.

477
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,560
And so I got to play around to you beat.

478
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,400
And they also had a reflect beat, actually.

479
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,480
So I was like, this is just I was like, dang, there's all these.

480
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
I thought like Loki was one of the only people in town

481
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,880
that had like a machine in their house.

482
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,200
But no, there's a whole scene of like private.

483
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,800
Oh, there's lots of people. Oh, yeah.

484
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,680
No, I'm I'm learning that real quick.

485
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,600
There's lots of.

486
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,280
Meanwhile, you know, my friends like, what are you going to get a machine?

487
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,120
And I'm like, I've got I've got my BurgerTime replica.

488
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,360
And at some point I'll probably get a Tron replica.

489
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,640
Maybe Santa will bring me one. Who knows?

490
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,920
So at some point there'll be a Tron replica here.

491
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,160
And then that's that's probably.

492
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
That's that's going to be it.

493
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,520
I don't see myself fitting in a music game in here.

494
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,440
It's a little noisy, I think so.

495
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,480
Way too much pinball.

496
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,600
Oh, man, a pinball machine would be really fun.

497
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
I really it's a bummer.

498
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,480
Like, we have to borrow one.

499
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,240
Well, it's a bummer.

500
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,680
We have to park our cars in the garage because otherwise

501
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,200
I would be very willing to put that kind of stuff in the garage.

502
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,080
But we have no space because the cars.

503
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,720
So, yeah, let's see.

504
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,520
Looking in chat, Dr.

505
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,840
Seuss, it sounds like a fun time.

506
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,640
Yeah, it was as 200.

507
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,480
Matt says, I remember nearly breaking my back,

508
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,040
dragging why our technical machine up three flights of stairs.

509
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,560
Luckily, these guys lived on the bottom floor,

510
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,040
so there was no stairs involved or actually they had a place

511
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,560
that like the stairs were in it.

512
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,440
So you had a bottom floor.

513
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,400
So and that's where everything was.

514
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,000
Oh, yeah.

515
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,720
Bobby Black Wolf and chat brings up.

516
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,600
I played pinball this week.

517
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,920
Bobby Black Wolf is very excited and is writing a very large high

518
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,560
because he finally dethroned me from his own pinball machine,

519
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,320
his rush pinball machine.

520
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,920
You might remember when I was out there visiting, I took the high score.

521
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,680
Bobby, Bobby was a little salty, a little salty about that.

522
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,680
And he but he played and played and played, played and played.

523
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,640
And he just thrown my score, my lucky streak.

524
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,440
So he has his score back.

525
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,960
So you all know what this means.

526
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,680
Number one, I should no longer be banned from that arcade.

527
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,200
So take my picture down.

528
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,480
Except I guess I'm still I'm still the lead of the Tron thing,

529
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,640
so maybe there's that.

530
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,640
But number two, I just have to beat it at Dragon Con 2023.

531
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,760
I now have a new bar to hit in 2023 when I go back.

532
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,080
Let's see.

533
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,960
So other stuff for my gaming week besides

534
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,080
machines, arcade machines and fun things like that.

535
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,840
A lot of the same.

536
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,160
I also been playing quite a bit of Dead by Daylight.

537
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,400
I really was trying to grind out the Halloween event before it was done.

538
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,040
Didn't finish the tomes because I didn't play quite enough Dead by Daylight,

539
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,880
but I farmed enough blood points.

540
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,640
I was up to like a million and a half blood points

541
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,360
where I was able to finish prestigeing Hattie and Yoonjin.

542
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,040
I finished prestige.

543
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,040
I'm trying to get every survivor,

544
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,720
except for the Stranger Things kids for now,

545
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,720
every other survivor to level one prestige so I can get their perks.

546
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,600
Yeah, with the Stranger Things license and the changes they made with that,

547
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,320
Steve and Nancy no longer have transferable perks.

548
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,480
So they're they're lowest on the priority.

549
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,760
I'm putting some in Steve just to get him enough to 15.

550
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,280
So I have four slots open because I have a Escape with Steve challenge.

551
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,040
OK, so so I have to invest in the Stoven.

552
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,160
There you go.

553
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,520
But yeah, I've been been enjoying that.

554
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,600
I did a stream the other night to whatever.

555
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,560
I also stream No Man's Sky,

556
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,560
which I am really, really enjoying relaxed mode in No Man's Sky.

557
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,000
It's really kind of reinvigorated the game for me

558
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,720
because I'm able to kind of.

559
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,280
It's not that I minded the grind in the game before,

560
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,360
but like to have that really eliminated.

561
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,440
Just makes it so much easier

562
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,000
to really feel like you're making progress and kind of pushing forward.

563
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,360
And I think what I'd like to do is really kind of try to set up a really nice.

564
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,720
I think I'm going to even though on stream

565
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,240
I've been setting up a pretty nice base on a planet.

566
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,560
What I'm really trying to do is get to the center of the galaxy

567
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,280
where somewhat spoiler alert, I don't think this is a spoiler.

568
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,480
You unlock other galaxies at the end of the game, basically.

569
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,160
So I want to travel to one of the other galaxies,

570
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,160
which spawns the paradise planets more frequently

571
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,840
and try to establish a base on one of the paradise

572
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,920
planets in the new galaxy and like do a super base type of thing.

573
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,760
So that's like my goal in the game right now.

574
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,080
But I still have a long way to go.

575
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,640
I'm assuming they're going to drop a new expedition on us relatively soon,

576
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,640
because if they don't, we're getting to the time of year

577
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,520
where they're probably going to recycle the old expeditions.

578
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,920
So I if they're going to drop like a six week expedition on us,

579
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,920
they need to do it next week unless they're planning another really short one.

580
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,280
Maybe they're going to do a tie in with another game again.

581
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,200
So it's going to be short.

582
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,080
I I don't know what it would be.

583
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,520
But I mean, they did do the Normandy when

584
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,600
the Mass Effect trilogy came out.

585
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,560
So fingers and toes crossed.

586
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,880
Maybe something can happen there, but we'll see.

587
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,680
So waiting on that.

588
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,960
And then more Final Fantasy 14, because I always play that game.

589
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,000
And yeah, a lot of the lot of the same old, same old stuff.

590
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,720
So not not a lot of new games this week.

591
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,600
But I will I will also make sure I get around to something new this week,

592
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,760
except I am leaving town on Thursday.

593
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,320
This is we don't have a show next week

594
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,720
that gives me two weeks to play something new. So we'll see.

595
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,400
So I did want to mention something real quick that I noticed

596
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,000
and more of an observation. So

597
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,120
a fellow podcaster in the area that we've met before.

598
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,080
David Webb had his had his kid last month.

599
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,040
So congratulations to them for their baby girl.

600
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,640
But it is it dawned on me, though, that I saw a message

601
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,520
from him on Twitter that says I miss podcasting.

602
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,880
I really wish I could go back to that. I was like, wait a second.

603
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,600
Aren't you on the Sacramento's number one gaming podcast?

604
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,440
Well, apparently they haven't been doing a podcast for a year.

605
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,160
So I guess by default, that means we're the number one

606
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,320
Sacramento gaming podcast now.

607
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,480
Yeah. Stop starting shit.

608
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,160
No, because I understand that they're they're really busy in there.

609
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,840
They're they are.

610
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,240
Corey. Yeah, I always I always love to remind Corey.

611
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,480
I guessed it on that episode and I was telling you what Overwatch was all about.

612
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,320
I always love to give him shit over that.

613
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,560
So but I mean, in all seriousness, like congrats to the best for them.

614
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,160
I just yeah, it's a hard time. Yeah.

615
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,840
So that's amazing.

616
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,080
All right. Prince Peach fuzz and chat says Loki makes a great point.

617
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,440
So I don't know.

618
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,280
I guess we'll get a banner made and go to a convention and make it official.

619
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,840
I don't know.

620
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,280
Didn't what did we already establish when that whole, you know,

621
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,600
when we were just, you know, and obviously they've been on this or they went there

622
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,280
when, you know, I thought that they were on this show.

623
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
I was on that show.

624
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,920
Like, it's whatever.

625
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,720
It's funny.

626
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,440
But I was going to say

627
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,000
the train derailed.

628
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,520
I was going to say, oh, yeah.

629
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,480
Didn't we at that time say, well, we don't need to be the number one podcast here

630
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,120
because we're the number one podcast in the galaxy.

631
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,240
We're the galaxy's number one podcast.

632
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,560
I think somebody actually wrote that in an iTunes review at some point.

633
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,800
So it's fine.

634
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,400
It's just it's just silly.

635
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,960
It was it was just funny. Yeah. All right.

636
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,400
Let's get into some more gaming news

637
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,960
and some other headlines from the week and we'll go to Loki.

638
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,240
I want to be surprised, but I'm not surprised.

639
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,320
But PlayStation Plus is apparently has lost nearly two million subscribers

640
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,640
after their relaunch and multiple tier thing.

641
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,240
That was utterly confusing and promised a bunch of stuff from PlayStation

642
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,360
now, which I absolutely don't want.

643
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,800
Like, I really don't like PlayStation now.

644
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,040
And I think it was dumb.

645
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,240
And I knew that they were going to offer like,

646
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,200
you know, the PlayStation one games just give us backwards compatibility.

647
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,560
Is it so hard?

648
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,320
Like people already have libraries of that stuff.

649
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,440
Why should we have to pay for backwards compatibility?

650
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,000
Well, apparently, though,

651
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,640
I think one of the problems is a lot of the classic games

652
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,240
that they have promised to bring out have been like slowly like droopy.

653
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,880
It's like almost like the Nintendo online stuff

654
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,120
where it's just slow to come out because.

655
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,000
Licensing, I'm sure.

656
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,080
But yeah, confusion with the overlapping tiers

657
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,520
and, you know, with subscribers

658
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,200
over which tiers of which era of games that they got and stuff like that.

659
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,280
You know, apparently now

660
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,120
it is the most expensive tier is actually increased as well.

661
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,400
It's up 10 percent.

662
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,640
And, you know, the revenue that they're bringing in is it's going up,

663
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,040
but it's just the number of subscribers is kind of declining.

664
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,280
In the second quarter, we renewed our services

665
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,560
and there has been great momentum as a whole, and this is coming from.

666
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,120
Was it a Hiroki to Toki,

667
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,680
who is making his comment on an earnings call, the CFO,

668
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,400
and basically said in the second quarter, yeah, we renewed our services

669
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,000
and there's been a great momentum as a whole before laying some of

670
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,560
they were saying lanes of the blame on the lack of aggressive ad spending

671
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,440
for the service, which is true.

672
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,360
I don't see any advertisements for PlayStation Plus,

673
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,520
but I just think, you know, as far as what I'm getting with PlayStation

674
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,840
Plus versus like, say, Game Pass, it's just seems to be a lot less.

675
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,320
I guess like I kind of made a face and you're talking about the advertising

676
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,200
because I'm like, as if gamers don't know.

677
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,080
But at the same time, I am thinking like, OK, well, like right now

678
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,600
Microsoft is like literally running a promotion with Twitch,

679
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,000
where if you give and I'm not saying this to be self-serving, I promise.

680
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,120
But like if you give two gift subs or something like that, or you

681
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,200
you do two subs on that, you get like a few months of PC game pass for free,

682
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,200
except right catch.

683
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,520
It's only for new subscribers.

684
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,520
It's not for you can't just add the time to an existing thing.

685
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,480
So it's really it's really a lot a longer trial than like 48 hours,

686
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,080
which is their usual giveaway trial for that type of stuff.

687
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,600
They'll do like a month with like discourse or something like that.

688
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,480
Like there's a lot of that.

689
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,160
I haven't seen PlayStation do any of that.

690
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,080
So I will say, OK, yeah, that in that now that I think about it,

691
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,760
like in that sense of advertising, yeah, they're really lacking.

692
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,120
They need to do they have this PlayStation even have a PC component to it.

693
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,440
Like, can I play?

694
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,560
You did, so there is PPS remote play that will allow you

695
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,800
like it's a desktop app that will allow you to connect to your PlayStation.

696
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,120
I would run it right now and show you a live demo

697
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,640
because I have it on my desktop and I've used it.

698
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,640
However, because it makes traffic go through your router

699
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,320
like a lot with the streaming, I don't want it might affect the program.

700
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,040
So I'm going to run it right now.

701
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,480
But it's it's it's just like running the PlayStation in a window on your desktop.

702
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,280
It's extremely great.

703
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,680
But like they have PC games, though, so they couldn't.

704
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,880
They have like a PC.

705
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,120
They cried of it that were like I could play God of War without having to buy it.

706
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,000
Sony, the company could enhance a lot because they could also give.

707
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,160
And I said this a long fucking time ago.

708
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,560
And again, I don't understand why these companies are so siloed

709
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,200
because they can give away movies.

710
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,240
They can give away television shows.

711
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,240
Crunchyroll, you know, the things that are in Sony's wheelhouse.

712
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,280
They could they could partner with all that stuff.

713
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,560
And I think they do for trial because I know somebody is going to say

714
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,360
you can't get a crunchyroll trial.

715
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,960
You know what I mean?

716
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,120
Like there should be things that are incorporated in that,

717
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,600
like a true entertainment pass.

718
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,040
And I'm just kind of surprised.

719
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,760
It seems like a missed opportunity there. So.

720
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,560
Oh, well, I mean,

721
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,040
they'll have to figure out something if they're really interested in retaining.

722
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,680
I'm not sure what percentage the two million was of their total subscribers,

723
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,760
but that's not a like, you know, they apparently see here.

724
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,560
So it's mentioning a games pass has 25 million subscribers.

725
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,160
I guess this isn't a huge chunk then.

726
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,240
So PlayStation Plus last summer had 48 million customers.

727
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,880
I and I'm just going to say what's been holding me back on.

728
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,720
I've never I never signed up for the expanded sub.

729
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,080
I'm still on just the regular PlayStation Plus.

730
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,960
And to be quite honest, I don't even know why I barely you know,

731
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,880
a lot of my gaming is switched to PC over the last few years.

732
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,280
You know, again, when stuff like Final Fantasy 16 and some of the other

733
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,840
exclusives, I'm interested in the, you know, God of War Ragnarok and stuff.

734
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,720
Once that stuff comes out, you know, I certainly will probably change my answer.

735
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:29,960
But I part of why I've resisted not signing up for the expanded service

736
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,120
is that I just I think the retro offerings especially are pathetic

737
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,320
for what Sony has access to in their library.

738
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,040
I think their retro offerings are downright pathetic.

739
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,600
Yeah. And they really need to up their game.

740
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,040
I mean, we give Nintendo a lot of crap,

741
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,760
but at least to Nintendo's credit, as far as NES and Super Nintendo go,

742
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,520
pretty much any first party title that doesn't have a licensing twist

743
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,560
to it is now on the switch.

744
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,400
Anything that's like a game where you're like, God, I really want this game

745
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,320
is probably I'm sure somebody is going to think of a first party game

746
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,520
that escapes me right now.

747
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,240
But for the most part, again, if it's a licensing issue, that's different.

748
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,640
But for the most part, first party games are all there now.

749
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,840
It's the third party stuff that, you know, anything you want, like,

750
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,960
you know, more Castlevania games or something they're lacking

751
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,120
because the third parties aren't jumping on that.

752
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,920
And so I really feel like Sony's service

753
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,640
has very minimal third party representation

754
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,080
and it's still missing a ton of first party games.

755
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,160
So for me, that's why it hasn't caught on for me personally.

756
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,640
Anyway, let's move on.

757
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,040
We'll talk about what's going on with streaming over on Xbox

758
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,560
with the xCloud, which, of course, is another streaming solution.

759
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,120
And xCloud is something that you can run on Steam Deck and Chrome OS

760
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,280
as some different places.

761
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,640
And if you are using xCloud through one of those services,

762
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,720
you are getting a little bit of an upgrade because now there is a higher

763
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,600
resolution that's being pushed to those platforms.

764
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,120
An Xbox employee on Windows Center, excuse me,

765
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,840
wrote on Reddit and then Windows Central did the original report on this.

766
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,520
An Xbox employee wrote on Reddit that the update is an end

767
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,240
of a transition to a different type of streaming tech.

768
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,120
They did not go into the details about what that is.

769
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,040
But basically, if you use a browser to get to xCloud gaming,

770
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,280
even if that's iOS on your phone or iPad, whatever it is,

771
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,720
you're going to have what they call a more consistent experience.

772
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,080
So remember, you know, xCloud works on a lot of different places.

773
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,640
Meta plans to bring it to the MetaQuest 2 as well.

774
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,680
So there is that.

775
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,840
But yeah, Microsoft is also said to be eager for Steam Deck users

776
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,720
to access the xCloud gaming.

777
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,400
There is not an official Xbox app for the system yet,

778
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,440
but there is a guide for setting up the service on Stream Deck.

779
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,040
So it's not often you see a company like Microsoft

780
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,000
kind of embrace a guide on how to do a work around.

781
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,440
But you know what? They want to get people on the cloud.

782
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,880
That's what they're going to do.

783
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,920
So I like xCloud.

784
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,520
I don't use a lot of cloud gaming right now

785
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,840
just because I did buy a nice computer

786
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,440
where I don't really need to leverage the cloud for a lot right now.

787
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,720
But I like that there's a lot of games available on it and so forth.

788
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,320
I like that Microsoft is being very aware about trying to get it everywhere

789
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,680
and that by them publishing a guide like here's how to get it on Steam Deck,

790
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,640
like they know that's a huge opportunity for them

791
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,160
is to get on those Steam Decks and expand people's library.

792
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,680
I think that's just really smart.

793
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,600
So She Hulk 10 and chat along with 100 biddies.

794
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,480
So thank you very much.

795
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,240
Says the cloud is the future. Don't fight it.

796
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,480
I do agree. The cloud is the future.

797
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,040
It's, I think, a little slower to take

798
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,040
than maybe most people are waiting, you know, ready for.

799
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,800
But again, I've said this a long time.

800
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,680
When 5G is more widely available in the US,

801
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,040
cloud gaming is going to really take off.

802
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,160
Just a matter of time, and we're going to see more games like

803
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,840
you know, the promised upcoming Hideo Kojima game.

804
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,400
Not to get too much into what's up next, but Kojima has mentioned

805
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,920
he's working with Microsoft on something that incorporates new cloud technology.

806
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,200
So you're going to see games that incorporate cloud technology.

807
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,760
But before I say too much, let's go to our next story from Dark Sakura.

808
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,480
There has been footage leaked of Kojima's unannounced game.

809
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,520
They show the video with a character

810
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,760
who looks like Margaret Qualley, who was in Death Stranding.

811
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,960
And there's a jump scare that says game over

812
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,000
and then a Hideo Kojima game and then overdose.

813
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:52,120
So, of course, Kojima Pro requested it to be removed.

814
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,520
But this may be related to

815
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,080
when he was saying he's watching horror movies, prepping for a future project.

816
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,800
And then the fact that he said he is working on a cloud based

817
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,360
project with Xbox, this could very well be it.

818
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,440
I don't know if you actually got to see the video

819
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,480
because something really funny happens in it.

820
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,520
But like in the leaked video, once the overdose logo comes up,

821
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,480
it's on the mostly black screen.

822
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,640
So the monitor is reflective and you can see the person filming.

823
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,800
It is some dude without a shirt.

824
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,400
You can't you can't see his face.

825
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,640
So you just see man boobs like staring you in the face

826
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,760
next to the overdose logo.

827
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,600
And I'm like, that's the jump scare.

828
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,760
And I didn't know.

829
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,000
Of course, I watched the footage.

830
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,080
I had to. I didn't.

831
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,000
Also, though, has been confirmation by Norman Reedus

832
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,600
that there is a sequel confirmed for Death Stranding in the works.

833
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,840
So interesting.

834
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,880
Well, the game awards are going to be sooner rather than later.

835
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,040
Believe it or not, that's going to be in like a month.

836
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,600
So I would guess if I have a new Hideo Kojima game to announce,

837
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,800
that might be the place to do it, because, you know, Kojima and Jeff Keighley,

838
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,200
they're best buds.

839
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,040
So that would be the place to see it.

840
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,640
And I wonder if that leaked footage from shirtless dude

841
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,200
wasn't some type of early footage to practice with the game awards.

842
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,320
So I wonder if the shirtless dude isn't somebody that works for Keighley

843
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,240
or somebody on that. I mean, who knows?

844
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,840
Or the whole thing could be a really fucking elaborate hoax,

845
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,480
which sometimes these things turn into.

846
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,400
But I don't know that was if it's a hoax.

847
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,800
It was a really well done hoax.

848
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,480
But there are other ways to post shirtless selfies

849
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,480
on your body progress to the Internet.

850
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,080
I'm just saying there are other way.

851
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,520
Get get get it.

852
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,280
Tumblr is cool with that.

853
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,520
Now get a tumbler.

854
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,440
The debate that they tumble back in that direction.

855
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,360
They tumbled back into not not hardcore pornography,

856
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,840
but artistic nudes are OK now.

857
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,440
So if you want to celebrate the human form, I'm trying to remember what they said.

858
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,520
They're going to celebrate the human form.

859
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,720
If you're like, I woke up like this and you have a boner

860
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,960
that you're posting on Tumblr, you can do that now.

861
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,920
But you cannot post.

862
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,400
But no one wants to see that.

863
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,200
Yeah. Well, I don't want to see that.

864
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,200
I was going to say the Internet, keep your body parts in your bedroom.

865
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,440
Use use hashtags.

866
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,960
So Jamie, commute the one she doesn't want to see or anyone for that matter.

867
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,360
Tiger Claw on chat says, Watch the new game be Death Stranding 2.

868
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:51,720
Why? I mean, couldn't the two games be the same thing?

869
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,960
Couldn't it be Death Stranding 2 overdose?

870
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,000
I know it's a stretch.

871
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,200
Who's to say Death Stranding 2 can't be a horror game?

872
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,080
We've seen games cross genres as sequels before.

873
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,480
Just a thought. It could.

874
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,840
I mean, but I know it's a stretch, but it could anyway.

875
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,560
Speaking of things that are a stretch.

876
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,080
Is it really a stretch in this year of 2022?

877
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,160
Convincing me to buy it is the stretch.

878
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,040
Oh, yeah, they're really stretchy like taffy.

879
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,160
So Square Enix has decided, hey, we're going to announce

880
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,840
our brand new NFT collectible art project.

881
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,080
Oh, yeah. I know you guys are super hyped for symbiogenesis.

882
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,760
I know that Parasite Eve reboot.

883
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,120
By the sound of that, you think it's Parasite Eve, but no, no.

884
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,960
The only parasite we're going to be putting out in the world

885
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,200
is the ask for cryptocurrency and,

886
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,400
you know, these profile pics that you might be able to use with this.

887
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,720
But yeah, apparently it's art that

888
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,560
some sort of art project that you'll be able to.

889
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,640
Untangle some story and get NFTs,

890
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,560
and it's a big old scam sounding thing, so.

891
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,080
Yeah, I'm not not excited about that at all,

892
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,640
and I think it's stupid and I hope it flops.

893
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,120
I hope it fails so fast.

894
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,920
All right. Well, Square Enix has not had a good week

895
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,720
and not even Yoshi P could save Square Enix from this week,

896
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,200
even though he's saved the Final Fantasy franchise.

897
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,400
He's not immune from having some really bad trade

898
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,600
takes trademark patent pending.

899
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,920
And boy, was there one this week and there was a new IGN interview

900
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,840
that was posted with Naoki Yoshida talking about some things

901
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,960
about Final Fantasy 16.

902
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,440
But the portion that's gotten a lot of people's attention

903
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,400
has to do with his answer when he was confronted with the question.

904
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,440
Basically, you know, we've had all these trailers for Final Fantasy 16.

905
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,800
Are there going to be black people in the game?

906
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,640
Are there going to be a diverse

907
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,520
group of people in Final Fantasy 16?

908
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,600
Because we're not seeing him in the trailer.

909
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,200
And in a really long answer, Yoshi P basically said no.

910
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,120
In part, here's an excerpt.

911
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,120
Ultimately, we felt that while incorporating ethnic diversity

912
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,240
into vallustesia, I think is the name of the world there was important,

913
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,080
an over incorporation into the single corner of a much larger world

914
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,800
could end up causing a violation of those narrative boundaries

915
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,000
we originally set for ourselves.

916
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,040
The story we are telling is fantasy, yes, but it's also rooted in reality.

917
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,720
So basically, I'm going to really liberally cut edges here.

918
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,520
But what I'm hearing out of what Yoshi P was saying was basically

919
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,920
we're trying to make something that emulates Game of Thrones.

920
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,200
And because. In medieval Europe,

921
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,440
it was pretty white, we kept our game pretty white.

922
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,960
And of course, a lot of people, a lot of people, a lot of people.

923
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,440
Are correct to quickly point out a few things.

924
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,640
Number one, there actually was diversity in medieval Europe.

925
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:15,360
There were quite a few persons of many colors.

926
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:21,640
In fact, a few even were nobles.

927
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,360
And yeah, Dark Tetsuya says,

928
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,160
I know Square Enix has been struggling with this for years.

929
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,040
I mean, in 16 games, there's been what, three POC that I can think of?

930
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,280
Yeah, hold that thought for a minute,

931
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,520
because I'm going to come back to that in a minute.

932
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,080
But yeah, obviously there's that, that, you know,

933
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,320
yes, there actually were diverse people in medieval Europe.

934
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,400
Number two, I guess, though, if you were to go to Game of Thrones,

935
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,280
which this game is clearly trying to emulate, while yes,

936
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:01,160
there were characters of color in Game of Thrones,

937
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,920
they many would argue they were not really main characters

938
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,440
that were utilized as well as they could have been.

939
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,200
So perhaps if that goal is to emulate Game of Thrones,

940
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,640
then that's a little more what they're doing.

941
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,680
But also, it should be pointed out.

942
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,400
And many people, again, are pointing out your game is Final Fantasy.

943
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,280
Fantasy, why are you so hell bent on rooting it in reality?

944
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,120
You can't say your game is rooted in reality

945
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,720
while you're showing off a trailer of ice lady

946
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,160
throwing icicles at giant rock man fighting.

947
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,480
I mean, hello.

948
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,640
And you ride giant chickens, so I mean, come on. Yeah.

949
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,880
So obviously there are some problems with what Yoshi P said this week.

950
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,360
Now, before I come back for some other comments,

951
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,520
I want to go to another story involving Square Enix.

952
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,080
I think some of this may have been from last week.

953
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,920
I'm going to say it anyway, because the the side I'm looking at here,

954
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,840
VG charts just published it six days ago anyway.

955
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,200
So it's it's from this week.

956
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,480
Square Enix president and director

957
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,240
Yosuke Matsuda in the 2022 annual report for Square Enix says

958
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,040
it is difficult to achieve growth for companies

959
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,560
that primarily focus on the Japanese gaming industry.

960
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,320
And it is important for Square Enix to offer games

961
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,600
that will be popular worldwide in a quote.

962
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,760
Director Yasuke Matsuda said, achieving major growth in the game

963
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,480
industry is difficult now for companies that compete

964
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,960
primarily in the Japanese market, given its graying demographics.

965
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,000
As such, it is critical for our business that we produce hit titles

966
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,240
that speak to the global market, which offers greater scale

967
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,520
in terms of both customers and sales volumes.

968
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,960
Furthermore, game development efforts are becoming more sizable

969
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,920
and sophisticated as the result of technological advancements

970
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,560
in the devices on which they are played, such as consoles or smart devices.

971
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,600
The investment required to develop game titles is therefore

972
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,160
an order of magnitude greater than in the past.

973
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,000
In other words, the Japanese market is no longer sufficient

974
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,560
for achieving a level of earnings that enables us to recoup

975
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,040
our development investment and generate a profit.

976
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,600
And we therefore need to approach our development efforts

977
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,000
based on the assumption that we have to succeed in the global market.

978
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:24,800
Mr.

979
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,200
Yosuke Matsudasan.

980
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,640
The answer is right in front of you.

981
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:40,800
Because I would say, while Yoshi P made a bad statement this week.

982
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,200
There's a lot of people on Twitter doing what Twitter usually and I'm

983
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,680
not even going to walk into the garbage fire of what a lot of

984
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,960
Twitter is this week, I'm just going to talk social media in general.

985
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:56,080
There's a lot of people ready to cancel Yoshi P for what he said.

986
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,040
And while I'm sure I think Yoshi P should be accountable for what he said,

987
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:09,320
I think canceling him is extremely, extremely short-sighted of the real problem.

988
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,440
And what am I getting at?

989
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:21,000
The real problem is a lot of Japanese studios don't get it.

990
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:29,640
Because Japan hasn't had a lot of the same discussions in their country

991
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,400
that we've had in this country.

992
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:40,440
There's quite a bit of, for lack of a better description, it's, it's

993
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:47,280
unaware racism, like they still have people who perform in blackface.

994
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,240
They, they have all kinds of appropriative action.

995
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,840
But then again, I mean, you look societally, like most of the society

996
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,920
there was appropriated from other places at its formation.

997
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,680
But, um, but, but going back to it, it's, it's a cultural issue.

998
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,960
It's, it's something that has to be seen through a more complex lens.

999
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,680
And with any cultural issue and including our own issues here with,

1000
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:16,320
with racism and bigotry, you have to dismantle the foundation.

1001
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:16,800
Yep.

1002
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:24,360
You know, so it's ridiculous, but it's where you have to start.

1003
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:24,880
Yeah.

1004
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:29,360
But the reason why I brought up what, you know, Yasuke Masuda said was

1005
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:35,520
because in my view, these things are very closely aligned is that he's

1006
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,640
sitting here saying, how do we succeed in a global market?

1007
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,040
And then a statement like this comes out of his company this week.

1008
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,440
That's the answer.

1009
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,560
Start there.

1010
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,520
Because if Japan wants to, Japanese developers want to succeed in the

1011
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,680
global market, then they also need to open up to this because let's be real.

1012
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,120
This is not just an issue of Final Fantasy 16.

1013
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,600
Did y'all not look at the cast of Final Fantasy 15?

1014
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,560
This isn't an issue just dedicated to the Final Fantasy series.

1015
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,040
Y'all ever played Genshin Impact?

1016
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,720
Fantasy 6 had more diversity.

1017
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,880
So there's a lot, and I'm not going to say every Japanese developer does this

1018
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,480
because you all will name games that have done better diversity and so forth.

1019
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:30,280
And Rama, if you want to call in now, I'll take your call now.

1020
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:37,880
But this is something that Japan, you know, Japanese developers need

1021
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,560
to address on a wider scale.

1022
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,280
Some other comments in chat here.

1023
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,920
Tiger Cloud Chat says, if it's emulating Game of Thrones, this means they also

1024
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,720
have to emulate the sex that is associated with it.

1025
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,720
I guess a fair point as to, you know, leaving some things out or what have you.

1026
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,400
So, which child's getting thrown out the window or into the, into the fire.

1027
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,960
Was that Game of Thrones or was that another show?

1028
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,120
That gif of the baby getting thrown in the fire.

1029
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:04,920
Was that Game of Thrones?

1030
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:05,880
I don't know.

1031
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,360
Anyway, uh, let's see other comments from chat.

1032
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,040
Um, it's fine though.

1033
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,880
Cause that child that, you know, fell out the window, you know, he'll become king

1034
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,720
someday, so it's fine.

1035
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,120
Yeah.

1036
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,240
Anyway, I want to bring Rama, I want to let Rama have a say on this as well.

1037
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,880
Uh, so I'm going to go to discord where I believe Rama called in.

1038
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,600
Hey, what's going on y'all?

1039
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,680
Hey, not much, but we are talking about an issue.

1040
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,840
Um, and you know, it does have to do with the representation of, uh, black

1041
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,440
individuals in video games.

1042
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,000
I'm not black Rama.

1043
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:41,920
None of us are.

1044
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,160
But I will say this.

1045
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,400
You are gay as the day is long.

1046
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,880
And even still Japan still has a slight issue with that.

1047
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,360
Oh yeah.

1048
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:50,760
Oh yeah.

1049
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,280
I'm aware.

1050
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:51,760
I'm aware.

1051
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:52,640
Tell it.

1052
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,600
And for the record, before I begin, I just want you to know, I'm just sitting

1053
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,560
here, putting my laundry away.

1054
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:03,160
I'm like, I got words to say, and then you go, feel free to call in.

1055
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,320
I'm just like, God damn it.

1056
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,280
I don't even have a shirt on.

1057
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,760
I'm running around throwing a shirt on so I can be semi decent for y'all

1058
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,480
because I love all of y'all.

1059
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,760
You can, he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to make another

1060
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,280
leaked pic of that one game.

1061
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,760
So yeah, you don't want to have an overdose or problem here.

1062
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,400
Uh, you can always not be on cam.

1063
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:20,800
It's fine.

1064
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,560
I know I, I kinda, but, but you know, your, your perspective for

1065
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,160
many reasons is important.

1066
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,680
I also, you know, because you have, you do anime jam session, I know you're

1067
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,560
very familiar with Japanese culture.

1068
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,560
That's, that's very much a reason.

1069
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,160
I'd like to hear your take on this topic.

1070
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,920
I will say this.

1071
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,240
I have heard from people, you know, who have gone to Japan and talk about,

1072
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,960
oh, how in Japan, they kind of treat black people differently.

1073
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:51,040
I'm like, you can be white as bread and they will still treat you differently.

1074
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:58,040
A lot of the issues I hear in anime fandom is that Japan does not include

1075
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:02,560
us in anime unless it's like a stereotype character and so forth.

1076
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,840
Oddly enough, when it comes to video games, there were some rumblings

1077
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:12,040
with Barrett Wallace, Saz, and Shadow the Hedgehog.

1078
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:20,400
So, personally, I'm, I didn't have an issue with it, but it's what

1079
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,160
they go off of and what is known.

1080
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:30,320
Now, there are some people who have started their own anime studios in Japan.

1081
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,520
They're like, you know what, if we can't get them to do what we want, I'm

1082
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,960
going to make something for all of us.

1083
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,360
Sometimes it works.

1084
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,600
Sometimes it does not.

1085
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:43,360
Part of the issue is Japan is seen as a xenophobic country.

1086
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:48,920
Also, Japan only does, when it comes to manga, anime, video games, they

1087
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:54,560
only go by what they know and they will pull from various texts

1088
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,840
from history and just roll with it.

1089
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,360
Personally, I just don't have an issue with it because I don't go down that

1090
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:08,280
far down the rabbit hole, because if I did, I'd probably be talking

1091
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:11,240
with y'all about this while we're in a kufi and a dashiki.

1092
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:16,480
But you mentioned in chat, you don't really have an interest

1093
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,040
in Fam SE 16 at this point until it's in the bargain bin.

1094
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:20,720
Exactly.

1095
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,080
I, as you know, I don't fully believe in cancel culture.

1096
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,640
I believe people, they may mess up.

1097
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:32,160
They should be allowed a chance at redemption, but that redemption

1098
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,240
should fall on them, not do it because people want them to do it.

1099
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:38,360
Sorry.

1100
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,360
And I don't mean to interrupt, but I think it's important to state

1101
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,760
and to set like expectations or whatever appropriately.

1102
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:48,240
Final Fantasy 16 is not suddenly going to get a black character in it.

1103
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,680
Like they're, they're pushing that game for summer of 2023.

1104
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,920
That's, that's not going to happen at this point.

1105
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,800
Like just, I, I, I'm not saying that's the right, I'm just saying

1106
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,040
that's the realist thing, you know, especially when you hear these

1107
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,920
comments about Square Enix is struggling a little bit, they're not

1108
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,480
delaying this game for this.

1109
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,880
So the game is coming out.

1110
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,360
Maybe there is DLC.

1111
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:12,400
I don't know, but I think this is something Square Enix needs to address

1112
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,640
moving forward with future games than trying to necessarily fix this one.

1113
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:23,240
I mean, you could make one of the main characters black in FF16

1114
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,520
by doing a palette swap.

1115
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,840
Some people will be happy about that.

1116
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,840
Others will be, and you're into the crap.

1117
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,080
Yeah.

1118
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,320
Some people will take issue with that too.

1119
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:35,800
You know what, you know, it's worth bringing up, I don't know, but, um, I do

1120
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:40,960
know that we don't know who the voice actors are yet, you may have somebody

1121
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:46,640
black that is actually voicing a white character that was done in Final Fantasy

1122
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:54,120
14, um, because there was an actress that played Yuri, um, who Yuri was,

1123
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,080
you know, it's, it's, it's our rod, but fair skin, basically it was in the

1124
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,440
Stormblood, I remember that because unfortunately the voice actors passed

1125
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,320
away and I remember talking about that on the show and she passed away.

1126
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:08,560
But I remember like that she was a person of color and was playing,

1127
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,520
you know, uh, Yuri in a Final Fantasy 14.

1128
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,680
So, but I, at the same time, I'm just, I'm just saying that is

1129
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,160
something that they might be doing.

1130
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,000
Ashley's voice actor, Mass Effect.

1131
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:19,480
Yeah.

1132
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:19,880
Oh yeah.

1133
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,240
There's, and you know, we've seen, we've seen some of that, but it

1134
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,800
doesn't really address the issue.

1135
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,040
I'm just saying it might be something you find out.

1136
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,760
Helps like earlier, like last week, there was controversy about the anime

1137
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:36,040
bleach, the voice actor for Chad Jamison price stepped down and said, I am

1138
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:40,320
opening this roll up for people of color to do, you know, it's something

1139
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,400
that nobody asked him to do it.

1140
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,320
He just felt it was the right thing to do.

1141
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,760
And there was a person of color as the new voice of Chad.

1142
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:52,120
Black, black Facebook is like half is split down the middle.

1143
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,040
They're like, no, this is woke propaganda.

1144
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:55,840
Stop pandering.

1145
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,240
The other half, I think this is kind of cool.

1146
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,960
Me personally, I thought the dub was cool.

1147
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,080
I didn't know Jamison price was a white dude.

1148
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,760
I thought he did a great job.

1149
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,720
I don't think he should have stepped down cause nobody

1150
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,920
asked him to do a complaint.

1151
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,720
But if this is what he's doing to open up roles for people of color,

1152
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,280
to get further into the, into voice acting.

1153
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,520
So be it, if it sounds good, it sounds good as a voice of

1154
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,480
Jack is roll with the punches.

1155
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:29,400
You know, I will say, if nothing else, Yoshi P has shown at least

1156
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,720
here's the thing, Yoshi P, not a great look on this, but his track

1157
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,960
record is pretty good when it comes to being educated by his fan base.

1158
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,320
And I think you've seen that in final fantasy 14.

1159
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,120
Um, for example, the same sex marriage, or they call it the bonding

1160
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,120
ceremonies or whatever they call it in that he listened to the

1161
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,120
feedback and the team implemented that.

1162
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:56,080
Um, when they announced that Viera would be limited to female forms

1163
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:00,080
only, and you know, that many voices, including me rose up and said,

1164
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,120
why not have why I thought you said you weren't doing gender lock

1165
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:03,920
characters anymore.

1166
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,960
Why are you locking characters to certain gender?

1167
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,640
And they reverse that and they put male VR.

1168
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,880
I mean, we had to wait an expansion for it, but they put male

1169
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,320
VR in the game eventually.

1170
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,040
Um, and there's other things too.

1171
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,880
And you might remember when all of those issues with, um, end

1172
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,440
Walker's launch happened.

1173
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:26,440
Yoshi P said something I never hear CEO say, and that was, I'm sorry.

1174
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,920
So, you know, again, there's a lot, a lot can happen in the next few

1175
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,200
days, you know, Yoshi P has got to take some time to listen to this

1176
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,320
feedback and think carefully about the response.

1177
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:41,840
Although I really think the response needs to come from Matsuda about

1178
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:46,920
what they're going to do at square Enix's level to address this.

1179
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,800
And yes, I know they, I know they have games like four spoken, but

1180
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,720
that isn't really addressing the problem because final fantasy is

1181
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,960
a long running franchise with a diversity problem.

1182
01:09:59,440 --> 01:09:59,920
Right.

1183
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,960
I will say this before I get up on out of here.

1184
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,240
You know who Yoshi P needs to talk to about this?

1185
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,120
Harada from Tekken, two words, Leroy Smith.

1186
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,080
That's it.

1187
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:19,960
People asked Harada on Twitter about this character, and he just went on

1188
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:24,080
into this long, interesting diatribe about diversity within the Tekken

1189
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,960
games and fandom, black Twitter gave him an automatic pass to the cookout.

1190
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:36,600
I think there's a lot of developers in Japan right now who might need to listen.

1191
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:37,600
Yeah.

1192
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,200
A lot.

1193
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:43,440
That's why a lot of people of color are going to Japan, not just make

1194
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:48,040
their goals and dreams come true, but to be heard and be spoken and hoping

1195
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,920
that they work on a project or whatever.

1196
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:55,360
And what happens is they can be a part of it and be more involved when it

1197
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,600
comes to people like me, you know?

1198
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:04,640
Well, I love a new final fantasy game, you know, medieval setting character like me.

1199
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,080
We need somebody fabulous as you Rob, you know, we need an awesome spitfire

1200
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:14,080
like Jamie, you know, and we need an awesome badass like Loki.

1201
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,080
The Tsunteri is already a thing, so.

1202
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,280
We are a party of four.

1203
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,280
I can't call you a Tsunteri, that's an understatement.

1204
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,240
We are a party of four right now.

1205
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:29,440
So quick, which final fantasy class are you in the party right here, right now?

1206
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,840
We are the warriors of light.

1207
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,600
Which class are you?

1208
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,600
Really, Rob?

1209
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,600
Really?

1210
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,600
Black Mage.

1211
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,600
Come on now.

1212
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,600
It is not just because of that.

1213
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,600
If you remember, it's not just that.

1214
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:48,600
If you remember the webcomic nuclear power 8-bit theater, put us all together.

1215
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,600
I'll be snarky as that Black Mage.

1216
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,600
Believe you me.

1217
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,600
Bard for me.

1218
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,600
See, I would have to go snarky as that Black Mage.

1219
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,600
See, I would have to go, since I'm playing through Final Fantasy 5 right now,

1220
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:09,600
my most versatile character is Lena, who I have as a Red Mage with X magic.

1221
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,600
So I cast double spells.

1222
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,600
It's pretty useful.

1223
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,600
All right, Loki, you're all that's left.

1224
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,600
You're going to have to go warrior.

1225
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,600
We need a tank.

1226
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,600
We need to be our black belt.

1227
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,600
No, what do you want to be?

1228
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,600
You don't have to do it.

1229
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,600
What do you want to be?

1230
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,600
I was Red Mage before in 11, so I would do Red Mage again.

1231
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,600
Okay.

1232
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,600
There you go.

1233
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,600
All right.

1234
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,600
I think like when I'm in 14.

1235
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,600
Red Mage, Black Mage in 11.

1236
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,600
I think in 14, I was doing a summoner.

1237
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,600
So maybe summoner.

1238
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,600
We're going to be a Bard and three mages.

1239
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,600
We are going to get our fucking ass kicked by Chaos, but we'll have fun in the process.

1240
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,600
Red mages have very good defense.

1241
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,600
That's true.

1242
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:56,600
And I'm doing the Final Fantasy 5 version, so I can actually, instead of having double cast,

1243
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,600
I can do equip shields.

1244
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,600
There you go.

1245
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,600
There you go.

1246
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,600
All right.

1247
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:07,600
Rama, thank you for calling in and thank you for putting a shirt on and calling in and

1248
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,600
giving us your take on this.

1249
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,600
Really value your insight and so forth.

1250
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,600
And I invite all of the listeners, if they have something to say on this.

1251
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,600
I really would love to hear from everybody on this.

1252
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,600
Participate at orangelandtrady.com is the place to send an email, or you can tweet us,

1253
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,600
of course, throughout the week at OLR for at least a few more days until Twitter completely

1254
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,600
collapses.

1255
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,600
So thank you, Rama.

1256
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,600
An anime jam session.

1257
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:35,600
Everyone check that out Tuesday nights or on the podcast feed.

1258
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,600
9 p.m. Eastern.

1259
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,600
Come through.

1260
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,600
We'll have cookies.

1261
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,600
All right.

1262
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,600
Will do.

1263
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,600
Awesome.

1264
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,600
All right.

1265
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,600
Thanks, Rama.

1266
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,600
Appreciate you.

1267
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,600
No problem.

1268
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,600
You take care, y'all.

1269
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,600
All right.

1270
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,600
Bye.

1271
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,600
Bye.

1272
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,600
All right.

1273
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,600
Let's move on to our next story.

1274
01:13:52,600 --> 01:14:01,600
Well, you know, it was going to happen one day or another, but Lionsgate, which has produced

1275
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:09,600
the John Wick franchise, is in talks to do a major video game from it.

1276
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,600
I mean, there's not much details, but I would reckon it would be some sort of runaround

1277
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:19,600
and shoot the bad guy and get revenge for your dog sort of thing.

1278
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:25,600
Or it could be like some in-depth like Assassin's Creed style thing, you know, going by like

1279
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,600
the later movies or something.

1280
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,600
I don't know.

1281
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,600
But but at any rate, it's it's in talks.

1282
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,600
I don't have much more about that.

1283
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,600
Just it's floating.

1284
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:44,600
It needs to be like the TMNT arcade game with full 90s effects still in.

1285
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,600
Exactly.

1286
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,600
It's the only way that makes sense for me is just like, you know, you just have constant

1287
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,600
like streams of bad guys coming in kind of like the movie.

1288
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,600
Yeah, I play it.

1289
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,600
Loki, what do you have for us?

1290
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,600
All right.

1291
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,600
Well, old things becoming new again.

1292
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,600
So the Oregon Trail is coming to the switch on November 14th.

1293
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,600
So that's in like a week here.

1294
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:15,600
And yeah, apparently this is a project by Gameloft and Harper Collins.

1295
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,600
And it looks like kind of a remake, I guess, of the game.

1296
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,600
I'm not sure if this has been out on other platforms.

1297
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,600
I assume probably has.

1298
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:28,600
But yeah, now they're going to be bringing it to the switch so we can all die of dysentery

1299
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,600
together.

1300
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,600
Oh, yeah, of course.

1301
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,600
Right here.

1302
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,600
It says it's on Steam and on the Microsoft shop.

1303
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,600
So I'm assuming Xbox as well.

1304
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,600
Neat.

1305
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,600
Yeah.

1306
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,600
Check that out.

1307
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,600
Dark to see in chat says, I think it's an Apple arcade port.

1308
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,600
And yeah, Jason, our voiceover guy kind of referenced that in the intro tonight, too.

1309
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,600
It seems like it is a cool.

1310
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,600
Yeah, it's a port of what was on Apple Arcade a little while ago.

1311
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:59,600
So yeah, it'll be, you know, it's literally a game that defined a generation.

1312
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,600
So as long as I can go ham on like, oh, yes, I can on wildlife.

1313
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,600
That's awesome.

1314
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,600
Absolutely.

1315
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,600
I would hope so.

1316
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,600
All right.

1317
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:16,600
Well, going to our next story, let's talk about finally a premiere date for the HBO

1318
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,600
Last of Us series, which I know a lot of people are looking forward to.

1319
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,600
January 15th is the day.

1320
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,600
So you don't always see premieres in January, but that's pretty fun.

1321
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:32,600
The Last of Us TV series will be on HBO and HBO Max January 15th at 9 p.m.

1322
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,600
Eastern.

1323
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,600
Does that does that conflict with our show?

1324
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,600
Did they pick a Sunday?

1325
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,600
They sure did, didn't they?

1326
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,600
Yes, they did.

1327
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,600
That is a Sunday.

1328
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,600
Assholes.

1329
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,600
All right.

1330
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,600
Well, you have to tape it or watch it on HBO Max after the fact.

1331
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,600
Do you love how I still say you got to tape it as if anybody actually uses VHS to record

1332
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,600
things anyway?

1333
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,600
Does anyone still use VHS to record shows?

1334
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,600
But anyway, you got to you got to watch that on demand later because we'll be live.

1335
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,600
But I guess if you listen to us on the podcast feed, then that works, too.

1336
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,600
So you got to do one live and do the other later.

1337
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,600
So there's going to be 10 episodes in the initial season.

1338
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,600
Of course, you are probably already aware, but The Last of Us has Pedro Pascal starring

1339
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:20,600
as Joe and Bella Ramsey from Game of Thrones is starring as Ellie in the game.

1340
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,600
And there are some other big names in the series, like Nick Offerman, Gabriel Luna,

1341
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,600
Anna Torv are also in it.

1342
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,600
Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, voice actors from the game, will also be making appearances

1343
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,600
in the series.

1344
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,600
The show is expected to follow the plot of the game.

1345
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,600
So, you know, not to deviate too much from that, but we'll see.

1346
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,600
Who knows?

1347
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:48,600
Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann does serve as writer and executive producer from Chernobyl.

1348
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,600
Craig Mazin is also helping out with that.

1349
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,600
The Last of Us will have creative input from the developer and acclaimed talent behind

1350
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,600
the cameras.

1351
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:04,600
So it's not just like taking an IP and turning it over to people that are familiar with movies.

1352
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,600
They're working a lot more in tandem.

1353
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,600
So it'll be very interesting to see what happens with that.

1354
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,600
Oh, interesting.

1355
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:15,600
Rama in chat says, yes, a bunch of fans in Japan broke out their Betamax machines to

1356
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,600
record the reboot of Urusei Yatsura.

1357
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,600
I'll send you the link later.

1358
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,600
Wow.

1359
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,600
Eshun Hanomat says, does anyone remember the last thing they recorded via VHS?

1360
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,600
Yes, I do.

1361
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,600
My parents had a DVD player, but I was in college at the time and I wasn't fancy enough

1362
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,600
for a DVD player.

1363
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:43,600
So I would take the DVDs and I would transfer because our VHS machine had RCA, the red,

1364
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,600
yellow, white plugs on the front.

1365
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,600
So you could plug the DVD machine into the VCR and record off the DVD machine.

1366
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,600
So I recorded DVDs.

1367
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:57,600
The last thing I recorded off of VHS was from TV.

1368
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,600
And it was when we did the Guitar Hero thing.

1369
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,600
Oh, from the news.

1370
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,600
Yeah.

1371
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,600
Yep.

1372
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:08,600
I was gonna say the last movie I remember transferring from DVD to VHS like that was

1373
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:14,600
Cruel Intentions, which the quintessential 90s film, to be quite honest.

1374
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,600
I don't remember anything.

1375
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,600
From that movie or from VHS's?

1376
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,600
At all.

1377
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,600
Oh, at all.

1378
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,600
I don't remember the last three decades.

1379
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,600
Sorry.

1380
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,600
That's okay.

1381
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,600
Let's see.

1382
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,600
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the last thing I recorded on a VHS was a TV special that

1383
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,600
I was in early on in my NFL drumline career.

1384
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,600
There was a special about the lottery halftime show that we were in and they recorded a segment

1385
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,600
with us.

1386
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,600
Prince Peach Fuzz says, word of advice, don't watch any VHS tapes with no labels that are

1387
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,600
found underneath your parents bed.

1388
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,600
All right.

1389
01:19:49,600 --> 01:20:00,600
Don't go to a cabin in the resort areas of Japan and play any VHS tape that happens to

1390
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,600
be still in the VCR when you get there.

1391
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,600
Yes.

1392
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,600
I was gonna say if a friend hands you a tape and says you need to watch it within seven

1393
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,600
days, don't do it.

1394
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,600
All right.

1395
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:15,600
Let's get to our next segment, which obviously we're gonna get into the classic game of the

1396
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,600
week, but I wanted to say before we do that, and obviously it's a little different this

1397
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,600
week because once a month Dark Sakura mixes it up, but you might've noticed last week

1398
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:27,600
and this week, even though she's here, she's done a prerecorded segment for us because

1399
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,600
I believe it's a little easier on your voice to do this all in a prerecorded segment and

1400
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,600
you can make little movies to go with it.

1401
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:41,600
We are looking at ways for the podcast folks of putting these movies on social media like

1402
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,600
YouTube or something like that.

1403
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,600
I don't know if we'll do YouTube or TikTok, but one of those places where you can then

1404
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,600
watch these later on if you want throughout the week.

1405
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,600
So we are looking into that.

1406
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,600
I hope to have more to announce on that when we get back.

1407
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,600
So I just wanted to get that out there.

1408
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,600
But in the meantime, let's get to the segment, shall we?

1409
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:13,600
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1410
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,600
out a classic and tell you about it.

1411
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:20,600
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1412
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:29,600
Today's classic electronic game is a series of gaming watches released by Nelsonic starting

1413
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:33,600
in the late 1970s through the 1990s.

1414
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:40,600
Nelsonic, while being known for higher end watches currently, was well known for pop

1415
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,600
culture themed wrist watches for children and young adults.

1416
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:51,600
Their early watches had LCD screens with basic functions like the time, duh, and an alarm

1417
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,600
clock.

1418
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:58,600
The company was inspired by other specialty watches like calculator watches and even cigarette

1419
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,600
lighter watches to make gaming watches.

1420
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,600
And so they did.

1421
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:10,600
They obtained licenses from Sega, Nintendo, Midway, Milton Bradley, and others for games

1422
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:15,600
and even had licenses for standard watches from franchises like Barbie, G.I.

1423
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:22,600
Joe, Power Rangers, and Ghostbusters released as the real Ghostbusters to name a few.

1424
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:27,600
The company was also a distributor for the Game & Watch series.

1425
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:34,600
Among notable games are Simon, the Milton Bradley game, Space Attacker that was for

1426
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:40,600
some releases as Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan, The Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, Frogger,

1427
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:46,600
several Mario games, Legend of Zelda, Tetris, and a few others.

1428
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,600
In fact, two of their games were notable firsts.

1429
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:56,600
Luigi's Hammer Toss was the first game to feature only Luigi as a playable character,

1430
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,600
Princess Toadstool's Castle Run was her first as well.

1431
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:05,600
Star Fox had two different layout releases and one of them included a headphone jack

1432
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,600
and headphones.

1433
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:12,600
Some of these games were also released in Japan at McDonald's including the Luigi's

1434
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,600
Hammer Toss and the Princess Toadstool's Castle Run.

1435
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:23,600
The last two releases from Nelsonic came out in 1997 with the last actual game being Dinky

1436
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,600
Dino's Watch.

1437
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:31,600
It was a Tamagotchi style digital pet that you could raise and take care of.

1438
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:38,600
The other one was a standard licensed watch themed around Poochie, a pink and white canine

1439
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:43,600
marketing sensation from the late 80s through the 90s.

1440
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,600
I had a couple of Poochie dolls, I will admit to it.

1441
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,600
These days, the watches can actually fetch.

1442
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:58,600
Right now on eBay, they're ranging anywhere from about $45 to well over $500, close to

1443
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:02,600
$600 in and out of its packaging.

1444
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:09,600
One of them is a working mint-in-box Legend of Zelda, which is presently up to about $300.

1445
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:15,600
And then the most expensive one that I saw was a U.S. Princess Toadstool's Castle Run

1446
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,600
still in its packaging.

1447
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,600
So, a few of my friends had these.

1448
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:28,600
I did not, because honestly I couldn't stand wearing a watch.

1449
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:37,600
But my friends would play these in class, try to sneak with getting the game in.

1450
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,600
Of course, my other friends were busy programming their graphing calculators to play a whole

1451
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,600
position, for example.

1452
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,600
But I digress.

1453
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:50,600
These were pretty much everywhere, all the cool kids at them.

1454
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:56,600
And I mean, I don't recall them being supremely expensive when they came out.

1455
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,600
They were very novel sort of things.

1456
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:08,600
And definitely just looking at them evokes this nostalgia for me, so I'm here for it.

1457
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:15,600
If any of you still have a working one, I would love to know in our mailbox at participate

1458
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,600
at orangeloundradio.com.

1459
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:25,600
At any rate, this was the Classic Electronic Game, or Pentultimate Entry.

1460
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:31,600
Stay tuned for next month's Ultimate Entry.

1461
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,600
Alright, there it is.

1462
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,600
The Classic Electronic Handheld of the Month.

1463
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,600
I was never cool enough to have one of those, sadly.

1464
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,600
I remember them, though.

1465
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,600
My friend had that Tetris one.

1466
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,600
But yeah, they were pretty cool.

1467
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:49,600
Looking in some of the comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vlog network, Robot Giggles,

1468
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,600
first time chatter, hi, welcome to OLR, says, I want one.

1469
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,600
Yeah, that would be a fun retro thing to collect.

1470
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,600
Even just those special boxes.

1471
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,600
In the video, you kind of show the boxes.

1472
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,600
They are so expensive.

1473
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,600
I know, I know.

1474
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:10,600
Like, even one of those Luigi watches out of the package was like 200 bones.

1475
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,600
Yeah.

1476
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,600
Yes.

1477
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,600
You'll have to, the only way you're going to find one is to get like a garage sale or

1478
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,600
someplace that doesn't know the value of what those things are really worth, which, you

1479
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:22,600
know, is, you know, shady, but it is what it is.

1480
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:26,600
Didi Archaholic, Hello Hello says, I have never seen or heard of these watches before.

1481
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,600
That must have come out long after I was in school.

1482
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,600
When were these popular?

1483
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,600
I remember them when I was in school.

1484
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,600
Yeah.

1485
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,600
Oh.

1486
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,600
Yeah.

1487
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,600
Yeah.

1488
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,600
All right.

1489
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,600
Great pick.

1490
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,600
S2100 Matt says, I think I had a Double Dragon one, but that was Tiger Electronics.

1491
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,600
Well, I'm sure once, you know.

1492
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,600
These weren't Tiger.

1493
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,600
Yeah.

1494
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:48,600
Once, you know, these are out, then the other gaming franchises want to have their versions

1495
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,600
of that and all that good stuff.

1496
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:54,600
So I'm sure there were plenty of, I would say knockoffs, but clones we'll say.

1497
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:59,600
I'm not even going to say either of that because graphing, not graphing, but calculator watches

1498
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,600
have been around since the seventies.

1499
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:08,600
And even before that, they had like, like I was showing the pocket watch, a lighter

1500
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:14,600
and actually even today they have watches that have, that are USB charged that have

1501
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,600
a lighter built into them.

1502
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:25,600
You know, the, the concept of putting things in a watch and carrying it with you is, is

1503
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,600
not a really new concept.

1504
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,600
I mean, hello, I've got my, my Apple watch on.

1505
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:35,600
Never thought I would want a smartwatch until I used one.

1506
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,600
And then I was like, Oh, this is for me, game changing.

1507
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,600
Like just the whole like workout heart rate measuring.

1508
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,600
And now the, now I get, now I get.

1509
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,600
Call detection.

1510
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:45,600
Too damn loud.

1511
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,600
Yeah.

1512
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,600
All this stuff.

1513
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,600
I'm just like, I love it.

1514
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:53,600
So, and of course the necessary pictures of my kitties that I can look at all the time

1515
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,600
on the background.

1516
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,600
So there's that too.

1517
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,600
I just use the modular ones that I don't forget when crap is.

1518
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:05,600
And I know how hot it is, which is not a Prince Peach fuzz is asking doom on a watch.

1519
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,600
Not yet.

1520
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,600
Not yet.

1521
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,600
But you probably do it though.

1522
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,600
Yeah, probably.

1523
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,600
I'm sure it's possible.

1524
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,600
Oh, come on.

1525
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:19,600
I, I, on one of like an old, like black and white Mac, I had four disc doom installed

1526
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,600
on one of those in the lab at school.

1527
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,600
So I could play it instead of paying attention.

1528
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,600
I love that.

1529
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,600
All right.

1530
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,600
So let's travel around the industry and check out some other headlines in a segment.

1531
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,600
We call rapid fire news.

1532
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,600
Uh, let's start with Loki.

1533
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,600
Yep.

1534
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:39,600
So there's, um, a little bit more of an announcement from EA talking about their partnership with,

1535
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,600
um, Marvel.

1536
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,600
So they're going to be doing some Marvel games, including there's, I think three in the works

1537
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:47,600
right now.

1538
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,600
Uh, one of these is going to be an Ironman game.

1539
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:56,600
Um, um, they're saying that, you know, the other ones right now, we don't really know

1540
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,600
what those are going to be yet.

1541
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:04,600
Um, and this is outside of the, you know, midnight suns game that's coming up from fire

1542
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,600
access.

1543
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,600
And then that captain America, black Panther game, uh, that was supposed to be, I think

1544
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,600
coming out as well.

1545
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,600
I don't remember which studio is working on that.

1546
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,600
Um, so yeah, there was also supposed to be another black Panther game, I think at EA

1547
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,600
as well.

1548
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:27,600
So I guess we'll find out, you know, maybe game awards, maybe next E3.

1549
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,600
I don't know.

1550
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,600
Um, anyways, this is, uh, interesting, I guess.

1551
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,600
Um, so you know, that whole Gran Turismo movie that's supposed to be coming out.

1552
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:43,600
Well, apparently now, uh, Jerry Holloway Horner is joining the cast as well.

1553
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,600
So do you mean the ginger spice ginger spice?

1554
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,600
This is going to be the Gran Turismo movie.

1555
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,600
By the way, is everyone ready to feel old?

1556
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,600
Is everyone ready to feel old?

1557
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,600
Spice World just had its 25th anniversary album released.

1558
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,600
Spice World is 25 years old.

1559
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,600
That's their second album.

1560
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:03,600
Right?

1561
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,600
What?

1562
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,600
I feel old every time I get out of bed.

1563
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,600
Yeah.

1564
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,600
My body reminds me I'm old every day.

1565
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,600
Okay.

1566
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,600
Tangent time.

1567
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,600
Choo choo trains pulled up to the station.

1568
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:15,600
Here we go.

1569
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,600
Tangent train.

1570
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:19,600
Let's talk about feeling old for a minute.

1571
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:27,600
Yesterday, I went, um, into San Francisco to see the touring production of Jagged Little Pill, which was on Broadway a few years ago.

1572
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,600
I think it was, uh, I want to say Grammy nominated, Tony nominated or whatever they call those awards.

1573
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:43,600
So long story short, I had went out to Broadway, New York City in 2019 before the pandemic to see, uh, Jagged Little Pill on Broadway.

1574
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:48,600
Um, and I went with my friend, Melanie, um, one of the Mel's.

1575
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:52,600
Uh, so we went out in Broadway and we saw the show there.

1576
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:59,600
Three years later, almost to the day yesterday, we went and saw it in San Francisco together again.

1577
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,600
So we got to see the show three years apart.

1578
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,600
And there were actually things I liked about the touring production better.

1579
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,600
One of them was the seats, but that's, that's neither here nor there.

1580
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:15,600
Um, my point is we decided it would be cute to get pictures in front of the marquee three years apart.

1581
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:20,600
Hilariously, because it was fucking cold in New York, I was wearing the, uh, a hoodie.

1582
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:25,600
And because it was cold in San Francisco yesterday and rainy, I was wearing the exact same hoodie.

1583
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,600
In fact, it's this it's actually behind me here.

1584
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,600
Oh shit, it's way over there on the couch.

1585
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:34,600
I can't grab it easily, but it's, it's an Atari hoodie that I had imported.

1586
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:41,600
Anybody that's seen a selfie, I love that fucking hoodie because it has like the actual like wood grain on it.

1587
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,600
Um, it's, it's a beautiful hoodie.

1588
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,600
I'll grab it when somebody else is doing a show, a story and put it on cam.

1589
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:51,600
But, um, my point with all that is I could see two things.

1590
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,600
One, I could see the weight loss in my face.

1591
01:31:54,600 --> 01:32:00,600
You know, I don't always notice that in selfies of me, but I was like, Oh fuck, my face is like a lot thinner than it was three years ago.

1592
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,600
But number two.

1593
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,600
Happens.

1594
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:11,600
And number two, to the point of this whole tangent train, there is so much more gray in my beard now than there was three years ago.

1595
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:16,600
It has been a long pandemic.

1596
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:17,600
You know what I found?

1597
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,600
What?

1598
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,600
The picture when you took me to the hospital for my surgery.

1599
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,600
Oh my gosh.

1600
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:29,600
Yeah, we, we, we look a bit different now.

1601
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,600
Yeah, absolutely.

1602
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,600
All right.

1603
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:36,600
That's just, that's just really, really fun.

1604
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:37,600
Yeah.

1605
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,600
This is interesting to see like a very similar picture, even if it's in like two very different towns.

1606
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,600
It's very similar to see that, um, like three years apart.

1607
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,600
Uh, I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1608
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:56,600
Uh, when I brought up spice spice world, uh, Jessiks and chat says, I'm ashamed to say I saw the spice girls movie in the theater.

1609
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:57,600
Don't be ashamed.

1610
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,600
Don't be ashamed.

1611
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,600
I had the best time.

1612
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,600
That movie came out when I was in college.

1613
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,600
So I can't even say I was a kid and I made my parents take me.

1614
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,600
That movie came out when I was in college.

1615
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,600
It's one of those movies that's like so cheesy, bad.

1616
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,600
It's kind of good.

1617
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,600
It has meatloaf in it.

1618
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,600
It does have meatloaf in it.

1619
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,600
It has Richard O'Brien in it.

1620
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:20,600
It has that scene where they, they have the bus jumping and they, they do the, anyway.

1621
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,600
Wasn't Rowan Atkinson in it?

1622
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,600
I think all the, and, um, absolutely fabulous.

1623
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,600
Had a cameo too.

1624
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:29,600
Like all the big British pop culture stuff was in it and you know, and it's, it's, it's,

1625
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,600
it's the spice world movie is still quotable.

1626
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:33,600
What should I wear?

1627
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:39,600
The little Gucci dress, the little Gucci dress or the little Gucci dress.

1628
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:44,600
Anyway, I promise never to quote that movie again on this show.

1629
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:45,600
No, I'm going to break that promise.

1630
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,600
We all know it.

1631
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,600
All right.

1632
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,600
Uh, moving on what we had more rapid fire.

1633
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:57,600
So like for spice girls stuff though, I still use, I use the story of the, the, uh, union

1634
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,600
flag dress.

1635
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,600
For me, customizing my own clothes.

1636
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:06,600
I was like, if ginger spice can do it with the tea towel and a dress, I can do it.

1637
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:11,600
I wanted to see that dress so bad when I was at the hard rock in Vegas before they bulldozed

1638
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,600
it.

1639
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,600
It's gone now.

1640
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:19,600
Um, because I'd seen it there in the year, in the year 2000, literally the first, the

1641
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,600
same trip where I was, I played dance, dance revolution for the first time.

1642
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:25,600
I saw that dress and I tried to go find it when we were there a few years ago.

1643
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,600
Again, another melody story.

1644
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,600
Um, couldn't find it.

1645
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,600
They moved it.

1646
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,600
It was gone.

1647
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,600
And now they've bulldozed the whole damn hotel.

1648
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,600
So I don't know where that dress is now, but I want to go see it again.

1649
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,600
It's like, it's like a movie.

1650
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,600
I want to go see that dress again.

1651
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,600
It is.

1652
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,600
It's yeah.

1653
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,600
It's a thing.

1654
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,600
I have one last anecdote.

1655
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,600
Yes, please.

1656
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,600
Dan sent me a trailer for a Broadway show.

1657
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:54,600
That's back to the future of the musical is playing at the winter garden theater.

1658
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,600
Oh, is that what they're replacing?

1659
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,600
Beetlejuice with?

1660
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,600
It must be.

1661
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,600
Cause I think Beetlejuice is in winter garden right now.

1662
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,600
And the thing is, is that I really want to see it because the one and only time I've

1663
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,600
been to a Broadway show was in the winter garden theater.

1664
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,600
And I saw cats, cats.

1665
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,600
Did you not hear me sing along with the entire, I know you sang along the entire, you defended

1666
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,600
that movie when no one else would.

1667
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,600
And I still love it.

1668
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:15,600
I know.

1669
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:20,600
I know you, uh, uh, uh, winter garden was where a mamma mia played for a long time too.

1670
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,600
And Rocky.

1671
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,600
Yeah.

1672
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,600
So, yeah.

1673
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,600
But, but, but I think cats was like its longest running.

1674
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,600
Oh, I'm sure.

1675
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,600
Show.

1676
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,600
I think it was like 19 years.

1677
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:31,600
Yeah.

1678
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,600
Yeah.

1679
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,600
Yeah.

1680
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,600
I was looking about going back to Broadway and seeing some stuff, but there's not, there's

1681
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,600
not a lot of shows where I'm like, Ooh, I have to see that.

1682
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,600
I still feel like Broadway is still trying to recover from everything that happened.

1683
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,600
It's going to take a few more months for them to get their group back.

1684
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:47,600
So, um, I mean, I'm not going to pay to see Lea Michele and funny girl.

1685
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,600
I'm not.

1686
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:52,600
Whenever there's a cat's revival, I definitely want to go, but I'm, you know,

1687
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:57,600
when I went like Tommy was playing and I could have seen that, but I picked cats.

1688
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,600
All right.

1689
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,600
Anyway, we should probably go back to video games.

1690
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,600
What do you have for us?

1691
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:09,600
Um, well, uh, the Pokemon developer creatures is hiring for work.

1692
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:14,600
Um, and indeed what they're hiring for is for next generation hardware.

1693
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:20,600
The listing actually says research and development for other next generation hardware is listed

1694
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,600
as this role's workflow.

1695
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:30,600
Um, meaning that they may be planning a project to show up on a future platform.

1696
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:35,600
Um, there, the job position is actually for a 3D CG character modeler.

1697
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:40,600
So, I mean, Hey, also if anyone wants a job, go apply, I guess.

1698
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:49,600
Um, but yeah, uh, and since they've, you know, been working on a Pokemon like that,

1699
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:50,600
it stands to reason.

1700
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:54,600
It could be another one, especially since the switches had like five of five mainline

1701
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,600
Pokemon games.

1702
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:59,600
And a new, a new one's going to be out right around the time.

1703
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,600
Our next show is, I think, in fact, I think gen nine will be out by the time we have our

1704
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,600
next episode.

1705
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,600
So I'm really excited about that.

1706
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:12,600
I mean, they've been involved with Pokemon since the, the get go, but they only started

1707
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:18,600
working with game freak, like ones that went to 3D in 2013.

1708
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,600
So it'd be interesting to see what happens.

1709
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,600
I'm being corrected on my Broadway, uh, by Rama, who says that Beetlejuice is at the

1710
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:26,600
marquee theater.

1711
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:29,600
The music man is currently playing at the winter garden.

1712
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,600
That must be the revival that had Hugh Jackman at one point.

1713
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:35,600
I don't think he's in it anymore, but anyway, thank you for the update.

1714
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,600
That's going to be gone in a few months.

1715
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:39,600
Yeah.

1716
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,600
All right.

1717
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,600
Let's, uh, get one more story here.

1718
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,600
Oh, this is about Mega Man 11.

1719
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,600
That's right.

1720
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:46,600
I want to talk about this release because this is interesting.

1721
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:49,600
Mega Man 11 has now, Oh, he is still in it.

1722
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,600
Oh, I didn't know that.

1723
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:51,600
Okay.

1724
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:55,600
Anyway, uh, we'll, we'll have to do a Broadway spinoff show as a different show.

1725
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:00,600
At some point, we still owe the listeners a foodie Oh show, by the way, it's been, it's

1726
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,600
literally been a year, but that was my fault.

1727
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,600
Uh, take full confession for that.

1728
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:05,600
Anyway.

1729
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:12,600
Um, Mega Man 11, 1.6 million in sales, uh, with the recent Capcom data with that, uh,

1730
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:17,600
it actually now is the best selling Mega Man game in the franchise.

1731
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,600
Uh, that is coming again from Capcom.

1732
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,600
Uh, they updated the sales figures on their site.

1733
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:28,600
Uh, and this means that Mega Man 11 is number 67 overall with 1.6 million in sales.

1734
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:35,600
Uh, Mega Man 2 used to be the best selling in the franchise, 1.51 million in sales.

1735
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:39,600
Of course, this has a lot of people asking, all right, Mega Man 12, when?

1736
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,600
No comment yet from Capcom, but I will remind everyone.

1737
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:43,600
The game awards is coming.

1738
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:48,600
Don't set the bar too high, but you know, if there was a good time to announce Mega

1739
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,600
Man 12, I think that would certainly be the time.

1740
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:55,600
So, all right, let's move on.

1741
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,600
Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that

1742
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,600
are, uh, coming out soon in a country near you.

1743
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:06,600
And this is, this is now the time where it's going to start to amp up, right?

1744
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,600
Nope.

1745
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:09,600
Not this week?

1746
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,600
Really?

1747
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,600
I would have thought we're in November now.

1748
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,600
Come on.

1749
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,600
We're, we're in the, we're in the fifth quarter now.

1750
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,600
So it's, it's not a lot.

1751
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,600
No, actually there are things coming out.

1752
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:25,600
So we have a game called a little to the left that's on PC and Mac, uh, football manager

1753
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:34,600
2023 on PC, Mac, and into the switch PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series, iOS, and Android.

1754
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:41,600

1755
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,600
four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

1756
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:49,600
We have God of war Ragnarok on PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

1757
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,600
Uh, let's see.

1758
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:57,600
Hakonewa, um, Bokujo, Kitsuju, um, Muru or Mura.

1759
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:58,600
I'm sorry.

1760
01:39:58,600 --> 01:39:59,600
Mispronounced the last part.

1761
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,600
Um, that is on Nintendo switch.

1762
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,600
Aichu, kazoo tight.

1763
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:06,600
That's on a Nintendo switch.

1764
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:12,600
I added that subtitle, obviously, uh, police simulator patrol officers on PlayStation four,

1765
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:19,600
PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series, tactics over reborn on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation

four, PlayStation five Valkyrie Elysium on PC.

01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,600
And I believe that's it for the week.

1768
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:37,600
Rob, you are muted, Rob.

1769
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:38,600
I'm very sorry about that.

1770
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:39,600
Wow.

1771
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:40,600
I made a booboo.

1772
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,600
Uh, okay.

1773
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,600
So let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases there.

1774
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:48,600
And, uh, we'll start with, uh, Sonic frontiers on the Nintendo switch is coming out.

1775
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:53,600
Uh, it says it is an English version, so I don't think they're, um, uh, uh, making a

1776
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,600
Japanese dub for that, but that will be released on the switch on November 8th.

1777
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,600
Um, so that is coming out.

1778
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:03,600
Um, also on the switch this week in Japan, I chew, uh, in a regular and a limited edition

1779
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,600
box set is coming out as well as Hakon.

1780
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:07,600
No.

1781
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:08,600
Yeah.

1782
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:09,600
Uh, Boku Joe hit suja.

1783
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,600
Mora is out this week.

1784
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:16,600
Commandos two and three HD remaster double pack is also out this week on the 10th of

1785
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:17,600
November.

1786
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:18,600
That is all on the switch.

1787
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:23,600
It looks like this, they even kind of do multiple days because on the 11th, we have tactics

1788
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,600
ogre reborn is also being released to Japan.

1789
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:27,600
Again, that one is not being localized.

1790
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,600
It's just an English release, but it is being released in Japan.

1791
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:35,600
And for those that collect amiibo, there are some Splatoon related amiibo coming out in

1792
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:36,600
Japan this week.

1793
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,600
So check that out.

1794
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:43,600
Uh, meanwhile, traveling over to the PlayStation five this week in Japan, Sonic frontiers is

1795
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,600
also on the PlayStation five this week.

1796
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:50,600
God of war Ragnarok also releases on in Japan the same day as the U S and, and assumably

1797
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:51,600
everywhere else in the world.

1798
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,600
Um, there is a special dual sense wireless controller that goes with that, that they

1799
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:56,600
are releasing in Japan.

1800
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:59,600
I think that controller is actually coming out everywhere, but there's also a PlayStation

1801
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:02,600
five bundle, regular and limited edition.

1802
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:06,600
Um, I'm not sure what makes it special besides the fact it comes with the game.

1803
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:10,600
Cause it doesn't seem to have even the branded controller with it, but, um, cool.

1804
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:12,600
I guess maybe if you want that anyway.

1805
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:13,600
Cool.

1806
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:18,600
Uh, and then lastly, WRC generations is also released on the PlayStation five in Japan

1807
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,600
this week.

1808
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,600
One more Mount and blade to banner Lord.

1809
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,600
It sounds pretty cool.

1810
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:25,600
How about Europe?

1811
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,600
Dark Sakura.

1812
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:32,600
Um, in Europe, we have, uh, uh, this batch is on the eighth.

1813
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:40,600
We have Sonic frontiers for the big three, four, uh, looks like for a PC, we have football

1814
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:41,600
manager 2023.

1815
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,600
Of course it's real football and not American football.

1816
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:48,600
Uh, PlayStation on the eighth also is stray.

1817
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:54,600
Uh, for switch, we have see who, um, for the three, we have Cobra Kai two dojos, which

1818
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,600
is like two dojos rising.

1819
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:57,600
Um, on the ninth.

1820
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:04,600
Now we have God of war, rock and rock on PlayStation, uh, on the 10th for PlayStation and switch.

1821
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:07,600
We have horse tales, Emerald ranch valley.

1822
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:14,600
Uh, I, I think I was watching, I think it's already out over here as I was watching, uh,

1823
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,600
Holly play it.

1824
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,600
It's me, Holly.

1825
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:24,600
Um, also in the 10th, we have asterix nublisk, uh, very, uh, uh, British institution there

1826
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,600
on the big three.

1827
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:30,600
Also for the same, we have Garfield lasagna party, leave out Garfield.

1828
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:32,600
I just want the lasagna party.

1829
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:33,600
Okay.

1830
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,600
Um, and then we also have dark D A R Q.

1831
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:41,600
Um, on the 11th, we have tactics, ogre reborn for PlayStation and switch for switch.

1832
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,600
We have ooblets.

1833
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:47,600
Um, for the 11th, we have yum, yum cook star.

1834
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:52,600
And then finally on the 12th, we have Atari 50, the anniversary celebration.

1835
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:56,600
Um, did I'm adding this tactics ogre that's on the 11th.

1836
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:57,600
Yeah.

1837
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:01,600
Um, it just looks like there's like a whole bunch of like revival series.

1838
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:11,600
Is it just me or like there is a Siberia, uh, game coming out and, uh, like, uh,

1839
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:15,600
like just gun grave, you know, all coming up.

1840
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:16,600
It's so interesting.

1841
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:20,600
I think, um, Bobby had mentioned on his show at some point, it makes a lot of sense that,

1842
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:23,600
you know, we're seeing a lot of games right now that are kind of things that were developed

1843
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:27,600
during COVID and the, you know, the pandemic and all that, and that doing remasters and

1844
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:32,600
things like that are a little easier to do, um, uh, remote working and that whole setup

1845
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,600
than maybe doing a new game.

1846
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:40,600
So you're probably seeing a lot of the fruits of that and just what has happened with pandemic.

1847
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:46,600
And plus I think the market's kind of shown that those games, people will buy them.

1848
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:49,600
You know, there's a lot of us that love to revisit the classic games, but there's a lot

1849
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,600
of people very thrilled about sweet code and one and two getting remastered and so on.

1850
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:55,600
There's lots of remasters that happens as part of the industry.

1851
01:44:55,600 --> 01:45:00,600
We get more excited about reboots in the video game space than we do in the movie space.

1852
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,600
That's for sure.

1853
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,600
And what good reason.

1854
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:05,600
All right.

1855
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:10,600
Well, if that is it for release dates, then we will move on and get a few more news stories

1856
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:14,600
for you before we open up the phones to any more callers that want to call in time.

1857
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,600
We already heard from Rama earlier in the show, but we're certainly willing to hear

1858
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:18,600
from some more people.

1859
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:23,600
Just head on over to our discord server, vog network.com slash discord, which by the way,

1860
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,600
it had some upgrades behind the scenes this week.

1861
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,600
We're now an official community server.

1862
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:31,600
Uh, so we just have a few extra features, nothing too, too fancy.

1863
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,600
Uh, but we did reorganize some rooms and things like that.

1864
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:39,600
So that way, all the notifications for when, uh, we're live or hosts affiliated with a

1865
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,600
network or live, things like that, they all moved into a different channel.

1866
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:46,600
So, um, you can, uh, you can, you know, see all that.

1867
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:49,600
So, and I do want to acknowledge, I see the hype train going in chat.

1868
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:54,600
I usually don't, uh, read all the donators as we go because we are taping for the podcast.

1869
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:57,600
So it's a little hard to do that Twitch thing that a lot of people do where you kind of

1870
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:58,600
interrupt what you're doing to thank everyone.

1871
01:45:58,600 --> 01:45:59,600
But I just want to call out.

1872
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:00,600
I see that.

1873
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:01,600
Thank you.

1874
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,600
You all don't have to do that, but you are, and I'm just very appreciative.

1875
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:05,600
Thank you for that.

1876
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,600
Um, so let's move on with a few more news stories.

1877
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:09,600
Loki.

1878
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:10,600
Yeah.

1879
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:15,600
You thought you could go a week without Activision ruining your day with news of maltreatment

1880
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:20,600
of their employees, but here we are another week where they're still not treating their

1881
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,600
employees right.

1882
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:28,600
So, um, there was a report from the, uh, union of QA testers.

1883
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:34,600
Uh, so that's the game workers Alliance, uh, talking about their ongoing negotiations

1884
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:35,600
with Activision.

1885
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:43,600
Um, so they've had meetings now talking about, apparently this was the fourth contract bargaining

1886
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,600
session.

1887
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:46,600
Um, it didn't go anywhere.

1888
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:51,600
They refused Activision refused to basically meet any of their demands.

1889
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:58,600
Um, they wouldn't change their hours or, um, out they said, or outsource the unionized

1890
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:04,600
jobs in the future, um, or not assurances that they wouldn't change hours or outsource

1891
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:05,600
those jobs.

1892
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:13,600
Um, they also refuse to guarantee, um, require or basically include protections for employees

1893
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:20,600
require reproductive healthcare and services because of, you know, Roe V Wade being overturned.

1894
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:26,600
And also the immediate 10% pay increase for QA testers.

1895
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:31,600
And on top of all that, they refuse to compensate them for time during negotiations, which I

1896
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:37,600
believe my understanding is required by law that they have to pay them for negotiation

1897
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,600
meeting time as well.

1898
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:45,600
Um, because they're still on the clock, but you know, Activision, the Activision, and

1899
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:49,600
they're just going to, they're going to wait until someone punishes them for that.

1900
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,600
Cost of doing business, I guess.

1901
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:55,600
When in the fuck is Kotick going to be out of there?

1902
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:59,600
Like, I can't like counting down the days, counting down the day.

1903
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:03,600
Well, it's just, I mean, you know, there's, there's new people coming in and they have

1904
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,600
the same mentality though.

1905
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:10,600
Like we talked about, was it that Lulu Chang at MERT, um, Missouri or whatever, who was

1906
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:14,600
like, you know, trolling people on Twitter or something like that.

1907
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:16,600
Like, I don't know.

1908
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,600
Yeah.

1909
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,600
And then, you know, I guess we haven't talked about it yet on the show, but then you have

1910
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,600
everything that's going on at Twitter.

1911
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,600
Let's talk about the place where all this stuff comes out.

1912
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:25,600
Twitter.

1913
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,600
I did have to repost that with a big fuck you to Activision.

1914
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,600
What a disaster Twitter is turning into quickly.

1915
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:37,600
And I'm telling you one day, one day in the very new feature, we're going to try to go

1916
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,600
to that website and it is not going to work.

1917
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,600
And the staff will be gone that could have brought it back.

1918
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:47,600
So you all remember the fail whale from 15 years ago.

1919
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,600
It's going to be back.

1920
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:53,600
So I just, yeah, I know there's a lot of people looking for alternative sites right now.

1921
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,600
I don't, I don't know what it is.

1922
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,600
Uh, you know, there's a lot of options that are out there.

1923
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:01,600
Some people are talking about, I don't know, Mastodon.

1924
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,600
There's things I like.

1925
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,600
I'm not going to Mastodon, it's a mess.

1926
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,600
There's things I like about it.

1927
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,600
There's things I don't like about it.

1928
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,600
I think some of the terminology they've used over there is a disaster.

1929
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:15,600
I understand in principle how it's built and the advantages of that.

1930
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:20,600
I think the way they're marketing it is really terrible, but something like that,

1931
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:24,600
that's open source is not meant to be marketed.

1932
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:26,600
So I, I don't know.

1933
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:27,600
I don't know how to fix that.

1934
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,600
Um, I like co-host a lot.

1935
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:33,600
I like what they're doing, but co-host has that line to get in now.

1936
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,600
And also co-host feels really rough around the edges.

1937
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,600
Like it just, it needs to grow, grow a little more.

1938
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,600
I know a lot of people are turning to Discord, um, to fill that in.

1939
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,600
Discord's a little different from Twitter to me.

1940
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:45,600
I don't know.

1941
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,600
And there's people that are going to say, I'm sticking with Twitter till the bitter end.

1942
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:52,600
Um, and you know, y'all do what you have to do.

1943
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:54,600
I've made my stance pretty clear.

1944
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,600
If the orange one gets unbanned, I'm leaving Twitter.

1945
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:03,600
Um, and I don't, I don't, I've, I've worked very hard over 15 years to build up a following on Twitter.

1946
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:05,600
And that is very hard to do.

1947
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,600
I don't want to be associated with that.

1948
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,600
And no, I'm not just going to mute them.

1949
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:11,600
I don't want to be associated with that platform anymore if that happens.

1950
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,600
So it's, it's quite that simple.

1951
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:14,600
I can do whatever I want.

1952
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,600
So can you.

1953
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:20,600
So, um, that, that, and that's, that's what I'm telling you will happen.

1954
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:23,600
Uh, Bobby Blackwell for the good point, download your archive.

1955
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,600
Uh, that's a good suggestion.

1956
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:29,600
I did, when I deactivated Facebook for a little while, I downloaded my archive before I did that.

1957
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,600
I think that's a very smart call to download your archive.

1958
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:34,600
And don't just download your archive if you're planning on leaving.

1959
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:42,600
Download your archive, end of sentence, because again, there's going to come a day when you go to twitter.com and it's not going to work.

1960
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:50,600
I'm, I can, I, I, I, I would be very confident.

1961
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:57,600
Somebody's going to try to fuck with Twitter on the outside, meaning like a DDoS or something to take it down.

1962
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,600
Um, it's really only a matter of time.

1963
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:02,600
So just a suggestion.

1964
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:06,600
Anyway, let's talk about Twitter blue thing also.

1965
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:10,600
It's just, it's unnecessary.

1966
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:14,600
Like I, I would have something that worked.

1967
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:15,600
Yeah.

1968
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:20,600
Well, and now that there's a shenanigans at the layoffs and then calling to ask people to come back because they're fucking up.

1969
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:21,600
Yeah, no, that's all.

1970
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,600
That's a whole mess.

1971
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:26,600
The layoffs in general were highly illegal.

1972
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:30,600
I'm just, uh, I have so much like irritation right now.

1973
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:39,600
As the show and her mat says just before the start of the show tonight, Kathy Griffin got perma suspended from Twitter for impersonating Lex Luther.

1974
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,600
So yeah, everybody's doing that.

1975
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:44,600
It's the, it's the new, the new meme, I guess.

1976
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,600
Yeah.

1977
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:51,600
Well, the, the, the self-proclaimed meme Lord apparently said, let the comedy begin or something like that.

1978
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:55,600
Cause you know, that's what intelligent CEOs do when they take over a multi-billion dollar company.

1979
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:02,600
And now also just tweeted today, people that impersonate accounts that don't label themselves a parody account will be permanently suspended.

1980
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,600
Well, where did the comedy show go, buddy?

1981
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:06,600
Oh, right.

1982
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:07,600
He can't take a joke.

1983
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:08,600
Obviously.

1984
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:11,600
It's just the whole thing is just reused.

1985
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:21,600
But anyway, but you know what, in a way, here's the light at the end of the tunnel where Kathy Griffin goes, not just her it's, it's, you know, cause I know she's a very polarizing people.

1986
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:30,600
I'm going to say wherever Lady Gaga goes, wherever Oprah goes, that will be the new social network.

1987
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:33,600
But I don't know if they go anywhere.

1988
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:34,600
You know what?

1989
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:38,600
The world existed and the world turned without Twitter.

1990
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:41,600
You survived without Twitter.

1991
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:44,600
Everything will be okay without Twitter.

1992
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,600
It sucks, but it'll be okay.

1993
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,600
I can't get it in my settings.

1994
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:50,600
Like my settings link is gone.

1995
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:52,600
Oh, weird.

1996
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:55,600
Anyway.

1997
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:56,600
All right.

1998
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:57,600
Let's move on.

1999
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,600
We have more stories to talk about.

2000
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:00,600
Actually, I think the next one is yours, Dark Soccer.

2001
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:02,600
Yeah.

2002
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:27,600
So, there is a big legal requirement now that for any video game company in New York City with over four employees, it has to give a good faith salary range in its job listings.

2003
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:35,600
That includes companies like Take Two, Rockstar, a few other games.

2004
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:44,600
I mean, the industry doesn't have like the biggest footprint in the city, but I think it's a very good thing.

2005
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:53,600
I think every company should do this is that everyone should, every company should be listing their pay ranges when they put up a job listing.

2006
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:58,600
Epic is among them.

2007
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:00,600
Twitch is having to do it.

2008
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:09,600
Activision is listing a measurement lead role with the salary putting on it.

2009
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:20,600
But basically, the majority of companies are not going to list how much they're going to offer to pay.

2010
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:23,600
And I think that this is a very good thing.

2011
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:34,600
In fact, the same sort of law is going to be going into effect in California and Washington State where an employer has to list pay ranges.

2012
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:42,600
This is a big departure as well from the days where they're like, oh, well, here's what you make and don't tell anybody.

2013
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:48,600
I'm like, tell everybody what you make and make sure that you are being paid.

2014
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:55,600
If you're being paid less than one of your coworkers, you go to HR and you ask them why.

2015
01:54:55,600 --> 01:55:11,600
If your base pay is lower, especially women, people of color, non-binary, anyone who is not the quote default white cisgender straight man.

2016
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:15,600
Definitely talk about your salary.

2017
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,600
I think this is a good thing.

2018
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:22,600
This is affecting all jobs listed in New York City.

2019
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:27,600
Yes, but obviously this is impacting the game industry, which we follow here.

2020
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:32,600
But also, I do notice that laws like this, because they were talking about doing something like this in California.

2021
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,600
I don't remember if they actually did it or not.

2022
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,600
No, the legislation is going through.

2023
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:37,600
That's what I said.

2024
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,600
Got it.

2025
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:49,600
Also giving a tip that Glassdoor tends to have a lot of salary ranges because people will post them on Glassdoor and say what they make when they can have a little anonymity to it.

2026
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:54,600
I know a lot of people use that website when they're researching places to work and things like that.

2027
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:57,600
All right, moving on.

2028
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:01,600
Speaking of Twitter antics and what they've led to, right, Loki?

2029
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:18,600
Yeah, so they've led to some, well, people obviously leave Twitter, including Nabilian or Nibel, who has been a popular news source in the gaming industry for quite a while.

2030
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:23,600
Aren't they one that posts insider leaks and stuff like that as well?

2031
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,600
I'm not really sure.

2032
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:26,600
Admit it.

2033
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:27,600
I never followed them.

2034
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:32,600
I recognize the icon, but I didn't follow them personally.

2035
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:37,600
I also don't follow Wario64, but how can you not miss what that person posts?

2036
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:40,600
It's everywhere whenever they post something.

2037
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:46,600
When that person leaves Twitter, that's pretty big.

2038
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:47,600
Yeah.

2039
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:52,600
Basically, they're moving to Patreon.

2040
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:56,600
Today, I will move on from both Twitter and Patreon.

2041
01:56:56,600 --> 01:57:00,600
There won't be any games coverage from me on either platform.

2042
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:04,600
I'm not doing Patreon anymore either.

2043
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,600
I don't know where they're going to go then.

2044
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:07,600
Interesting.

2045
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:09,600
On vacation.

2046
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,600
Probably.

2047
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,600
Hopefully.

2048
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:14,600
Well, best of luck.

2049
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:17,600
Bobby Blackwolf in chat said nobody wanted to pay him, so he shifted what he was doing.

2050
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:25,600
There was a lot of people that I saw commenting, like I didn't even know he had a Patreon to use.

2051
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:29,600
But Bobby does clarify that he's leaving the industry.

2052
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:35,600
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, I didn't follow Nabelle, but I respected the work they did.

2053
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:37,600
All right.

2054
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:39,600
Moving on, I got one more story.

2055
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:45,600
Kind of a cute little feel-good-ish type of story that goes back to our roots and where we all met each other.

2056
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:52,600
Of course, playing music games in the arcade, Dance Dance Revolution, and we met many great people through the years playing in the arcade.

2057
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:59,600
Somebody else in the music industry who really grew up on DDR was Porter Robinson.

2058
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:01,600
Things have come full circle.

2059
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:06,600
Porter Robinson now has a song, actually two songs, in Dance Dance Revolution.

2060
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:10,600
He actually posted a nice thing on Twitter and Instagram.

2061
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:12,600
It was really cute.

2062
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:15,600
It says, I'll read the caption here because I'm not going to play the video.

2063
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:18,600
The caption says, my songs are coming to DDR officially.

2064
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:22,600
It's almost impossible to fully explain how much this means to me.

2065
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:26,600
DDR was so formative in my life that I'm certain I'd be a completely different person without it.

2066
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:34,600
In fact, the only reason I started trying to make music as a little kid was to make songs for DDR.

2067
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:44,600
He talks in the video about how the music, the bright visuals, introducing Japanese music, getting influence from Japanese culture, all that has influenced him.

2068
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:49,600
I think we've all seen that DJ set he did where he incorporated Look to the Sky into it.

2069
01:58:49,600 --> 01:59:01,600
Anyway, a very similar worded song called Look at the Sky, one of his songs from the album Nurture, is going to be added to DDR along with the song Something Comforting.

2070
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:03,600
Those were just added to DDR.

2071
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:09,600
I believe this last week through the magic of EMUs and the internet and all that are on the DDR machines now.

2072
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:15,600
So you can check that out at your local round one or wherever you have a DDR machine that's hooked up to the internet.

2073
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:17,600
But congrats to Porter Robinson on that.

2074
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,600
That was great.

2075
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:21,600
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, it was hard not to get a little choked up watching that video.

2076
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,600
Yeah, for sure.

2077
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:24,600
It was awesome.

2078
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,600
So congrats.

2079
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:27,600
That's great.

2080
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:30,600
All right.

2081
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,600
Anyway, Porter Robinson is really cool.

2082
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:35,600
His brother's a fucking dick, but he's cool.

2083
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:37,600
All right.

2084
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:39,600
Anyway, let's move on.

2085
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:48,600
Let's talk the listener roundtable and invite your comments over at our Discord server, vog.network.com slash discord.

2086
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:54,600
If you want to join our green room, you can do so and we'll bring you on to the show.

2087
01:59:54,600 --> 02:00:02,600
And if you want to send us a mail email, you can participate at orange songs radio.com is the place to send us an email.

2088
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:06,600
Unfortunately, this week I am told we had dust.

2089
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:09,600
Anyone know dust?

2090
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:12,600
Anyone know dust?

2091
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:15,600
So that is an empty mailbag.

2092
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:19,600
Participate at orange songs radio.com.

2093
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:27,600
And if you have questions for us in chat, we'll take those as well over at twitch.tv slash vog network about anything we didn't talk about yet.

2094
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:30,600
Digirama S tags me and says, tell us how you really feel.

2095
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:31,600
I did.

2096
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:35,600
Loki, do we have any last minute stories?

2097
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:44,600
Well, just, you know, something that is kind of annoying, but I guess it's to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Candy Crush.

2098
02:00:44,600 --> 02:01:07,600
So, of course, they decided to do a huge 500 drone sign just over New York to celebrate Candy Crush and our dystopian future where they're going to be advertising in mobile games in the night sky where you can't avoid it.

2099
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:17,600
Is that is that what an appropriate follow up to talking about Porter Robinson's song, look at the sky and see the latest ads guy.

2100
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:19,600
It's it's advertisements.

2101
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:20,600
We've now resorted.

2102
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:23,600
We've now resorted to advertising in space.

2103
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:25,600
Like like.

2104
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:31,600
It's cool that you're celebrating 10 years of Candy Crush, but you know, you could like.

2105
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:32,600
Who's this for?

2106
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:34,600
Take out a full page ad in New York Times or something.

2107
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:35,600
And then they couldn't do it.

2108
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:42,600
They couldn't technically launch it from New York because they have to do it from Jersey because New York's like, no, you can't do that kind of stuff.

2109
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:43,600
But they're like.

2110
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:48,600
Well, it's going to be so big, you'll see it from Jersey, so it's fine.

2111
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:49,600
Yeah.

2112
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:50,600
All right.

2113
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:53,600
Well, I do not see anybody in the green room.

2114
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:58,600
I think we're about out of topics for tonight, so we'll go ahead and move to wrap things up tonight.

2115
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:03,600
As a reminder, we will not be here next week just due to personal obligations.

2116
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:05,600
Won't be here next week.

2117
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:09,600
However, we will be back in two weeks, ironically, on all this DDR talk.

2118
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:10,600
Guess what?

2119
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:12,600
It is 20 November in two weeks.

2120
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:15,600
So we're actually doing a show on 20 November this year.

2121
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:16,600
So that's right.

2122
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:20,600
And it's episode 937, which is nothing like 573.

2123
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:24,600
But like you'd you'd have on Wordle, you'd got two yellow boxes with that.

2124
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:26,600
So there's that anyway.

2125
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:28,600
Let's wrap things up.

2126
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:31,600
I want to say thank you to everybody for listening to our show tonight.

2127
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:36,600
Thank you for listening us either live or on the podcast feed, however you chose to

2128
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:37,600
consume Orange Launch Radio.

2129
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:39,600
Thank you so much for being here and doing so.

2130
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:41,600
I really appreciate you.

2131
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:43,600
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2132
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:45,600
Oh, if you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend or two.

2133
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:48,600
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2134
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:51,600
But, you know, we need more voices to put out here on air.

2135
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:53,600
So I really appreciate that.

2136
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:57,600
So, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, speaking of a fun social thing, we got a general chat

2137
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:00,600
room in the VOG Discord now where we can talk about all the things.

2138
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:01,600
Come join and chat during the week.

2139
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:02,600
Yes.

2140
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:03,600
Come say hello.

2141
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:04,600
I do.

2142
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:05,600
I lurk.

2143
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:09,600
I don't always actively chat, but it's hard to shut me up sometimes.

2144
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:10,600
So there is that.

2145
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:11,600
So.

2146
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:12,600
Oh.

2147
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:13,600
All right.

2148
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:15,600
Dark Sakura, let's go around and get final thoughts.

2149
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:17,600
What is your final thought for tonight?

2150
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:19,600
I am streaming.

2151
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:23,600
I won't be doing a lot of talking, but I would love for people to play with me tonight.

2152
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,600
All right.

2153
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:26,600
Check it out.

2154
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:28,600
On that note, I'll pop out.

2155
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:29,600
Later taters.

2156
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:30,600
Take care.

2157
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:31,600
All right.

2158
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:33,600
Loki, we'll go to you and your final thought tonight.

2159
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:38,600
My final thought is I'll be working more on my content again and hopefully going to fix

2160
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:39,600
my DDR machine.

2161
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:41,600
I'd be curious to find out what's wrong.

2162
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:42,600
Yeah.

2163
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:45,600
I want to hook up the actual arcade part of it.

2164
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:46,600
I hope it doesn't.

2165
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:47,600
I hope that's still working.

2166
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:48,600
Yeah.

2167
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:49,600
That would be sad.

2168
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:50,600
That would be sad.

2169
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:51,600
Let's see.

2170
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:56,600
But if, you know, you end up having to do something else with that machine, I know people

2171
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:57,600
you can talk to.

2172
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:58,600
No, no.

2173
02:03:58,600 --> 02:03:59,600
I would just replace the computer.

2174
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:02,600
Like that would just, it would cost like almost nothing.

2175
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:03,600
Fair enough.

2176
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:04,600
Let's see.

2177
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:05,600
My final thought.

2178
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:08,600
I don't really have a whole lot that comes to mind automatically.

2179
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:13,600
I just, I'm sorry I won't be here next week, but at the same time breaks are important.

2180
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:16,600
So, always take a moment to take a break.

2181
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:19,600
You know, a lot of things, especially with all the crap going on on social media, a lot

2182
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:22,600
of things can feel very overwhelming sometimes.

2183
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:24,600
There's just a lot of weird shit out there sometimes.

2184
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:29,600
So, like never be ashamed or afraid to take a break.

2185
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:33,600
Mental health is important and it's okay to say, I'm not feeling great today.

2186
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:35,600
I'm going to take a break.

2187
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:38,600
So, not that I'm saying that that's all impacting OLR, but I'm not.

2188
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:41,600
I'm just saying, you know, don't apologize for taking a break.

2189
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,600
Everybody's got to do it once in a while.

2190
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:43,600
So, take a break.

2191
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:45,600
I guess that's my final thought.

2192
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:46,600
All right.

2193
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:47,600
That's it.

2194
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:48,600
We'll see you next time here on Orange Dance Radio.

2195
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:50,600
We'll be back in two weeks.

2196
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:51,600
Have a great week.

2197
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:55,600
Thank you to all the veterans out there because it is Veterans Day weekend next weekend.

2198
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:57,600
That's why it's a long weekend in part.

2199
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:59,600
So, thank you to veterans.

2200
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:01,600
Enjoy Veterans Day and thank you to everybody.

2201
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:03,600
Have a good two weeks.

2202
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:05,600
We'll see you back on 20 November.

2203
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:06,600
Have a good night, everybody.

2204
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:07,600
