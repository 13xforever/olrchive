0	28000	Early into the debut of Apple Arcade, an Oregon Trail remaster came out. My two second review? It was well made. I'm a huge fan of the classic Apple II Oregon Trail as well as the first Windows 95 version. The decade since brought a Super Ragon Adventure and Oregon Trail, the one with zombies, and now we're back to palatable edutainment. Yes, my gravestone still says pepperoni and cheese.
28000	36000	This is your Westward Frontier update. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	59000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live here with you tonight on November the 6th of 2022 with episode number 936 of our show.
59000	68000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my co host here every week to talk about video games and all that good stuff. Joining me say hello to Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.
68000	70000	Hey, I think my webcam died.
70000	86000	Yeah, I was gonna say we don't see you on cam, but that's all right. Things happen. We'll do it live. That's the joys of taping live because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network. Nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackall show.
86000	88000	Camo works now.
88000	91000	I don't even know what that is. What's camo?
91000	95000	It's the one that I use to use my phone as my camera.
95000	96000	Oh.
96000	98000	Camo works, that's why I don't see her.
98000	108000	Dark Soccer used camouflage. It's super effective. Jokes like that and more brought to you by Loki. Hi, Loki.
108000	110000	That's right. I'm here.
111000	117000	You are wearing dad flannel making dad jokes. What's that dad game playing in the background behind you tonight?
117000	119000	Burnout Paradise.
119000	120000	Oh, good.
120000	122000	I couldn't think of anything.
122000	131000	No, it's a good pick. Why not? I like that. Dark Soccer. I see your Zoltar shirt tonight. It's pretty cool. I like that.
131000	138000	Yeah, the shirt that got a cease and desist delivered to coin up game room.
138000	140000	Oh, I didn't know about that.
140000	144000	Yeah, mine. Mine has a stand up a little bit. You can see.
144000	147000	Oh, okay. I see it has actual logo on it. Okay.
147000	151000	Yeah. So it was given to me gifted.
151000	155000	Nice. Well, Dark Soccer, I see your friend who you've brought up on the show previously.
155000	160000	Fanara is in chat saying you may get dysentery, I believe, commenting on Jason's intro tonight, which we'll get to later.
160000	166000	But it is it is lovely to see Fanara in chat. It looks like that means she's doing better. I hope that means so.
166000	171000	I think that she's incrementally better as far as I understand.
171000	172000	Yeah.
172000	174000	So but she'd have to answer that herself.
174000	176000	Fair enough.
176000	180000	I've been I've talked to my mother yesterday.
180000	182000	How is she doing?
182000	188000	She sounded really bad, but she was in good spirits. It was her 64th birthday.
188000	190000	Oh, happy birthday.
191000	195000	Your mom's the oldest Madonna.
195000	200000	Just an observation. That's all Madonna is also 64.
200000	206000	Well, at any rate, she sounded she she sounded in good spirits.
206000	213000	They think that they're figuring out how to beat the pneumonia.
213000	218000	And she actually says she could take some deeper breaths today.
218000	219000	Oh, good.
219000	222000	So I'm hoping that.
222000	228000	Fingers crossed, you know, but I'm still doing my marathon.
228000	230000	I was just about to ask you're doing a marathon, right?
230000	235000	Yeah, I'm not going to be able to do a whole lot of talking, of course.
235000	239000	So, wow, it let me in to co-host right away.
239000	243000	I just immediately signed up and immediately got in.
243000	246000	Oh, the Twitter clone co-host?
246000	247000	Yeah.
247000	251000	Caitlin, let's watch your tangent train focus.
251000	253000	Well, no, I try.
253000	256000	I had forgotten to sign up, so I just went ahead and did it.
256000	259000	I thought I'd have to wait, but no, I guess I'm special.
259000	264000	But anyway, I'm going to be playing Dead by Daylight for 12 hours.
264000	268000	I might, you know, take a break and do Cult of the Lamb or something,
268000	273000	but it's all to raise money for my mom's hospital bill.
273000	275000	She is completely uninsured.
275000	276000	This is Alabama.
276000	283000	She's had some pretty expensive work and treatment done to her.
283000	289000	So, you know, I just don't want to do what I can to help out my mom.
289000	291000	And for those in chat, I'll link the GoFundMe.
291000	298000	But, you know, if you can make it, it'll be from 12 o'clock p.m. Pacific to 12 midnight.
298000	304000	However else long I decide to go if I have energy for it or a voice.
304000	308000	I probably don't have the voice for it.
308000	314000	But, yeah, I'd appreciate some support even if you just, you know, show up and say hi.
314000	322000	And speaking of my voice, as you can hear, it's coming and going, but it's getting incrementally better.
322000	324000	I just have to take it easy.
324000	326000	I'm glad to hear it's getting better.
326000	329000	I was going to point out, too, we're actually not going to be here with Orange Lounge Radio.
329000	335000	And actually Bobby isn't here either just for like we all have kind of random reasons that we're all not available.
335000	340000	So it's well, I think Loki's here, but everybody else has some type of commitment next weekend.
340000	344000	So because you're in a Dead by Daylight tournament or something, right?
344000	345000	No.
345000	347000	I thought that was next Sunday for you.
347000	348000	I don't know why.
348000	349000	I'm not in a tournament at all.
349000	350000	I didn't sign up for it.
350000	351000	Why did I think that?
351000	352000	All right, whatever.
352000	356000	But I'm not here next Sunday because it would be fun.
356000	361000	Yeah, maybe that's maybe my brain is subconsciously telling you to sign up for one.
361000	362000	I don't know.
362000	366000	But I won't be here next weekend.
366000	368000	I'm going on a personal vacation.
368000	370000	So Alan and I will be up in Seattle.
370000	372000	Bobby's actually not going to be here next weekend either.
372000	374000	He's doing a personal vacation of sorts as well.
374000	377000	So say hi to our mutual friends up there.
377000	378000	Oh, yeah, absolutely.
378000	379000	For sure.
379000	381000	Can't wait to see some folks up there.
381000	385000	Actually, we did reach out to the streamer that you and I both know that lives up there.
385000	386000	But they're unavailable.
386000	388000	So they're also in town.
388000	392000	Yeah, I know the same reason.
392000	393000	Yeah, yeah.
393000	394000	So, yeah.
394000	398000	Anyway, let's move on and get into tonight's kickoff topic.
398000	405000	Let's talk about some things that are going on in gaming with you all in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
405000	410000	Fanara did give an update saying still breathing, but COVID-borne potato brain.
410000	412000	Sorry to hear it.
413000	421000	Hopefully, hopefully it gets sorted out sooner rather than later and doesn't doesn't stick around too terribly long.
421000	422000	All right.
422000	424000	Let's get into some gaming updates.
424000	435000	We'll go over to Loki to start us off tonight with some pretty big, long awaited updates that I would have thought would have had their own press conference or Nintendo Direct style video.
435000	437000	But no press release Monday morning.
437000	438000	Here we go.
438000	439000	Right.
439000	440000	Yep.
440000	441000	OK.
441000	452000	Sony has finally announced or unveiled to the world more details about the PlayStation VR to mean when we're going to get it and how much it's going to cost.
452000	453000	It's expensive.
453000	456000	It's going to be five hundred and fifty dollars.
456000	458000	It's going to release in February.
458000	467000	And they were talking about that the bundle is going to include Horizon, Call of the Mountain and also include a spin.
467000	469000	I guess.
469000	470000	Yeah, I think that's it.
470000	479000	It just includes that they're going to have 11 other games that are going to be coming out for it or ports that are set the release during the first year.
479000	491000	So we've got looks like Crossfire, Sierra Squad, the Light Brigade, Cities VR enhanced edition.
491000	493000	Cosmonia is high.
493000	494000	Hello, neighbors.
494000	495000	Search and rescue.
495000	496000	Man, that game is like.
496000	507000	Changed Jurassic World Aftermath Collection, Pistol Whip VR, Zenith, the last city after the fall tent clear.
507000	515000	And my personal favorite, the dark picture is switchback VR, which is a spiritual successor to Until Dawn Rush of Blood.
515000	517000	You know, I'm all about that.
517000	520000	So, yeah, when I saw that, I was like, oh, Loki got his wish.
520000	521000	I got my wish.
521000	522000	Yes.
522000	523000	Congratulations.
523000	524000	That's all.
524000	527000	That always feels good when the game makers grant your wish.
527000	528000	Yeah.
528000	530000	Although it isn't I mean, it isn't until dawn.
530000	532000	But, you know, I guess it wouldn't.
532000	533000	It's fine.
533000	534000	I don't really care.
534000	535000	It's a spiritual successor.
535000	537000	It's not, you know, there really is.
537000	539000	I didn't like that until dawn.
539000	540000	Yeah.
540000	541000	So it's fine.
541000	544000	I'm totally on board with it being something different.
544000	549000	I don't know what the dark picture I think is that dark picture is like there.
549000	551000	Overarching like universe.
551000	552000	I think so.
552000	556000	But then you have things like the quarry that didn't get branded into that.
556000	558000	But there were other games that were in that.
558000	562000	So I think it's I think it's like one of their multiverses.
562000	568000	Basically, the dark pictures makes me think of like that thing that Universal is trying to do with like the new Mummy movie.
568000	569000	Oh, no.
569000	571000	And this is what PlayStations got.
571000	572000	It's way more popular.
572000	573000	I know that.
573000	574000	It's just like I hear that.
575000	579000	And I was like, how does this tie in with the Mummy?
579000	580000	The Invisible Man.
580000	587000	Honestly, that's the approach maybe the Universal should take for that whole thing is make it a gaming universe.
587000	590000	Wouldn't that be something be better than that Tom Cruise?
590000	594000	The only way the Mummy is going to get better is to bring Brendan Fraser back.
594000	596000	That's that's the reality.
596000	597000	I guess.
597000	598000	Yeah.
598000	601000	But yeah, I'm very excited to see that.
601000	604000	The rest of the I don't really care.
604000	606000	But let me let me piggyback on that.
606000	611000	So are you saying that like you're sold on PSVR, too, just so you can play that one game?
611000	614000	Or are you kind of like, no, that's a lot of money.
614000	619000	I'm just hoping that if I wait long enough, they'll just port the PC, please.
619000	624000	That's that's that's a lot of that's a lot of cash for one game.
624000	628000	And I'm not dropping that kind of cash for one game.
628000	630000	I do as much as I like to see it.
630000	634000	I do really want a PSVR, too, eventually.
634000	640000	I'm not I mean, again, I'm not quite sold that any of these launch titles are like need to have for me.
640000	644000	But I'll kind of wait and see how the, you know, early reception is to it.
644000	651000	And, you know, kind of what the what social media ability because, my God, like, it's just going to be scalped up to hell.
651000	653000	And yeah, that worries me, too.
653000	656000	I just mean, it could be 20, 24.
656000	659000	We're looking into being able to get something like this.
659000	662000	Well, and even then, it's what else did they put out?
662000	666000	Let me put it this way. Shane sent me a text and was like, hey, are you getting a PSVR, too?
666000	669000	I'm like, no, I'm not going to buy one right away. I don't have a PS5 still.
669000	673000	He's like, great. Can I use your sign up to get an extra chance?
673000	681000	It's like, sure. I'm like, but actually, honestly, if I do if I do get in there to get a PlayStation PSVR, too.
681000	688000	That's not a very intelligent system because it should know I have never played on a PlayStation five.
688000	692000	Like, hey, they would know I never bought bought a PS5 for them.
692000	696000	Sure, I could have got one from Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon, you know, one of the other many places selling a PS5.
696000	699000	But they should still be able to know I have never logged into a PlayStation five.
699000	706000	I'm trying to think even like when I played PlayStation five at other people's houses, like in Bobby's theater and stuff,
706000	709000	I didn't log into my own account or anything. I don't remember doing that. I'm confident.
709000	712000	I don't think I would have done that. There's no reason to.
712000	718000	So it's not going to they should know I've never touched a PS5. They shouldn't sell me one of these.
718000	722000	So it's going to be really funny if I get an invite and he doesn't.
722000	726000	I'm just going to have to wait, you know, and see what happens with it.
726000	731000	I mean, it's like I said, you know, that's that's too much money for one game.
731000	737000	There needs to be like more to bring me to it. And I need that Tetris effect style game.
737000	747000	I mean, I do love No Man's Sky. I didn't love playing it in VR for an extended period of time because I start to get like the eye pull and like the.
747000	754000	But I'm wondering if the advances in technology are going to help with a lot of that, because I just I really want to just also like try the technology.
754000	765000	Yeah. So I'm kind of I'm I'm super curious to see how like something like No Man's Sky, which they're not just remember, they're they're technically calling it a PSVR to release.
765000	769000	It is separate from what they did for, you know, the original PSVR.
769000	776000	So I'm just kind of curious to see what they do with it, because I did enjoy playing No Man's Sky in VR, but just not for very long.
776000	781000	Yeah. I mean, there's like some of the other games that they're showing off, like Tentacular looks funny.
781000	788000	You're like a giant octopus thing. The Horizon spinoff looks really looks really good.
788000	794000	Yeah. I mean, that looks good. I don't know. Cities VR could be cool, I guess.
794000	800000	They need to get Mizuguchi to do something for it if they are already. I would be very surprised if to see Mizuguchi is not making some.
800000	812000	And of course, that's the mind behind Tetris Effect. But going back to Rez, you know, some of the other classic games, a lot of the old classic Sega titles, I would really hope he's making something for PSVR, too.
812000	819000	Yeah, hey, what about that Rez thing that we, you know, we were teased with, you know?
819000	826000	Oh, what? Area X, which very clearly is a prototype for a sequel to Rez, for a Rez 2 or a new Rez game.
826000	833000	Area X, if you watch the credits for Area X, you will, I know I've brought this up on the show before, but it's not like I haven't repeated myself before.
833000	841000	I'm going to remind everybody, if you actually watch the credits, you see at the very end, Area X is powered by the synesthesia engine.
841000	850000	And if you actually watch the Tetris Effect credits, it's powered by the same engine. So they built that engine to make games in.
850000	862000	And I really think Rez was, like Area X was supposed to be its own game, which is a bummer it wasn't fully realized because I love Area X and the music is so good in the Rez.
862000	871000	And this was the Rez, what, Rez VR, but they also, I think they released it in non-VR spaces as well, I want to say, because you can play Area X without being in VR.
871000	872000	Yeah, Rez HD or something like that.
872000	879000	Yeah, Rez HD. Sorry, they've re-released Rez so many times now, I forget what the different ones are differentiated, but the latest one that they did.
879000	889000	And the VR one was pretty awesome. It was fun to play it in VR. It's just, yeah, it would be cooler to see something, you know, it's kind of showing its age a little bit.
889000	892000	Yeah, a little bit, you know, it's a great game, but it's...
893000	898000	How about Justice for Child of Eden? You know, that game kind of came and went and it wasn't bad.
898000	912000	I liked that one a lot. I thought that was a really great game. And it kind of reminds me a lot of the Tetris Effect type stuff where they had a lot of that kind of earthy, you know, imagery and stuff like that with Child of Eden.
912000	925000	I would love to see Mizuguchi to get a really strong license. Oh, I guess. And honestly, he did with Tetris. I mean, Tetris is a huge license, but I think he and his, you know, builders have really proved themselves with that.
925000	938000	Like I think of, do you remember when Xbox Connect launched one of the early games they had for it? This might have been Xbox One, the line's a little blurry, but was the Fantasia thing? Disney Fantasia was the thing that they had on it?
938000	939000	Yeah, that was Connect.
939000	952000	Can you imagine if Mizuguchi had like a Disney license to make a Disney game in VR? That would be phenomenal. So I would love to see him get a huge like, I mean, of course, he makes great originals too.
952000	965000	So I can't say like, oh, you know, I'm not gonna be excited about whatever that guy makes next. But I would love for him to get a big, big license to play with besides Tetris, which honestly is already a big license, I guess.
965000	973000	So there is that. I think they will make a Tetris effect too as well. I think they have to. So yeah, we'll see. I just hope you know that.
976000	987000	The Switchback VR comes out on PC. I do see like some of the stuff that they're talking about, though, that like, and this is some of the things I and I sort of got it from the trailer and I'm not entirely sure.
987000	1008000	So the with the PlayStation VR has the head tracking. Remember? Yeah, it has your eye tracking. Yep. So unlike, you know, that one scene in Until Dawn Rush of Blood, because there's a lot of stuff that's obviously in this trailer that they've done before with the mannequins where it will basically the mannequins will move if you don't look at them.
1009000	1020000	But this one, it'll like they'll move if you blink your eyes. Oh, man. So they're weeping angels. Yeah, that's scary. I want to play this game so bad.
1020000	1035000	Prince Peach Fuzz is in our chat. Hi, I haven't seen that name in a while. Hope you're well, says I'm surprised they didn't call it the PS VR slim. Cute name. And it is that is one attractive thing about it. It's way less wires and way less bullshit for your living room.
1035000	1064000	Game changer. So it is a slim but remember it and this is a big reason why you know, we talked about why don't the PS VR games just work on PS VR to it's because it's it's really rebuilt places VR and it's low key was saying it's a different type of tracking. It's not tracking through the camera anymore. Like you know, the original one was it's not using like the moves this red and blue dots. It's it's completely built different when it Yeah, it's inside out tracking. It's like completely different so they wouldn't be able to port. And they could be a little bit different.
1065000	1077000	They could probably you could remake your games, I guess using that tracking, but it wouldn't be something that they could just say, Oh, there's gonna be backwards compatibility with these that would be very difficult for them to do.
1077000	1085480	Fanara is in chat saying dreamlight Valley VR dropkick Donald, I think that would be a Kingdom Hearts VR heal me son of a bitch. All right.
1086000	1087840	This is their Kingdom Hearts VR game.
1088240	1097680	I think it was like a spin off. It wasn't like an actual mainline. But you know how there's you know, Kingdom Hearts VR 36 over to Jupiter.
1100480	1101360	For matching service
1101360	1103600	for matching service featuring true kids destination.
1104320	1111720	I thought that they had like it was either a Kingdom Hearts or it was like a Final Fantasy. I thought they had a VR thing.
1112080	1115160	There was Bobby says it was an experience, not a game.
1115480	1119800	Well, right. They're all experiences. That's that's the thing that sucked to like what was it?
1119840	1124560	There was there was a Utada Hikaru experience where you just watch them sing a song.
1125080	1135960	Yeah, there was that one game because so this is the best part. And this would be my hope if the PlayStation VR to it. I hope it comes with this.
1136720	1138680	Like, don't get me wrong, like,
1140920	1153880	it's expensive. But one of the things I liked about the first one was it came with that demo disk. And I understand that we're past the age of demo disk. But come on, like, let's just indulge us a little bit. Like
1154400	1156280	give me access to the demo cloud.
1156840	1161240	No, no, no. That got me that got me by for like such a long time because it had
1162560	1166640	it had that first stage of Until Dawn Rush of Blood, which is fantastic.
1167400	1170200	I mean, not that you wouldn't just buy it anyways, because it's like 20 bucks.
1170200	1173000	It was just such a stupid like.
1174160	1176520	Such an easy decision to make.
1176520	1179200	But they had that it had like,
1179200	1183640	you know, I'm assuming they're going to do something with like playroom with this that'll probably be free as well.
1184720	1186840	Or maybe AstroBots, which might not be free.
1187240	1190800	And then, God, there was this like flight sim game.
1190800	1192440	That was pretty awesome.
1192440	1195200	But it was an experience.
1195480	1199480	And so like it was like getting good.
1199480	1201720	And it's just, oh, and fade black.
1201920	1203960	And I guess that's how the actual game was, too.
1203960	1208040	So I'm hoping that we get some longer experiences now that,
1208440	1214560	you know, this system can run Unreal five and it can run more powerful things.
1214560	1217440	And so I'm curious to see what they come out with.
1218200	1221320	Prince Peach Fuzz in chat says Wii Sports was fantastic.
1221320	1223280	And it was basically a demo disk, right?
1223280	1229080	Well, Nintendo is so good at packaging their tech demos into like games like what was one,
1229360	1233840	one to switch was just that is nothing but a tech demo compilation.
1233840	1236560	Yeah, that didn't work out so well for them once you switch.
1236560	1238160	But then they tried it again.
1238160	1242040	I mean, they feel like more people bought that than probably should have.
1242040	1245880	But yeah, Wii Sports, they tried to do it again with Wii Play and even tried to like,
1245920	1249480	well, we'll give you a controller and Wii remote plus with that.
1249520	1253480	Oh, yeah, I remember that thing where made the controller like five feet long.
1254200	1257160	And then there, but Wii Fit was a runaway success.
1257840	1261520	Yeah, Wii Fit balance boards that are stacked up at your local, you know,
1262520	1264800	your local trade in store
1266360	1268760	thrift store, you know, it's just like, hey,
1269040	1272440	there will be a renaissance when they try to find a plastic guitar now.
1272560	1275280	That was the joke. Five years ago. Try to find one now.
1275280	1279200	They're not easy to find anymore because, you know, you go to the store there.
1279440	1282280	Oh, you got to be not being the great may not be in the greatest
1283200	1285440	like DJ Hero Controller is like crazy.
1285440	1287280	They're like seriously all the time.
1287280	1290040	Interesting, but they may not be in the greatest shape,
1290040	1294200	but you just buy a few of them and swap parts around and you get work in one.
1294680	1296480	I want to read some other comments in chat.
1296480	1299440	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I think it was smart for them to announce this,
1299440	1301480	especially the price in this blog post.
1301760	1305280	We all knew the price was going to sting, dropping the price in a blog,
1305280	1308920	soften the blow and avoided a possible five hundred and ninety nine
1308920	1311680	U.S. dollars moment when that's like what they're asking.
1311680	1314280	It's only five hundred fifty U.S. dollars.
1314280	1318400	But well, they are selling a horizon bundle that is five hundred and ninety
1318400	1319360	nine U.S. dollars.
1319360	1322160	So there is that. But oh, it's not free.
1322160	1323440	I thought that was just included.
1323440	1325960	Oh, at least that's not the impression I got.
1326280	1327640	Of course. Am I wrong?
1327640	1331000	The company that charges seventy dollars for the Horizon Party games.
1331280	1333280	Yeah, let's see.
1333280	1334640	There was another good comment.
1334640	1338080	Oh, she helped ten said, Is it compatible with Pornhub?
1338760	1341640	You know, you laugh, you joke.
1341640	1342400	Well, maybe you don't.
1342400	1346160	But I say a lot of people would say that with tongue firmly planted in cheek.
1346160	1352120	But a lot of times the winning media format is chosen by the porn industry.
1352800	1356960	And certainly pornography exists in VR, at least on PC.
1356960	1360120	Is does the PlayStation five have a web browser?
1360360	1362520	Because I don't think that they do.
1362520	1365920	They I don't know. That's a question for chat.
1365920	1368120	Just chat. No, just PlayStation five have a web browser
1368120	1370680	because Xbox Series X still has Edge built in.
1370720	1372800	So there's that Microsoft.
1372800	1374800	I know, but I'm just saying it's not like they
1375280	1378200	they all got rid of them with the current generation of consoles.
1378240	1382560	I just thought they wouldn't because like, you know, well, so it opens them up for
1383360	1385200	all for having Sony.
1385200	1388040	Just remember, Sony does not allow adults
1388040	1391440	only rated content because that's why the ESRB exists. Right.
1391440	1395440	So if your game is really rated adults only, you can't sell it
1395440	1398560	officially on the Sony platform in the marketplace or anything like that.
1398560	1401800	In fact, all the all the big game companies have that same rule.
1402040	1403280	Got to go to PC and Steam.
1403280	1406160	Yeah, you got to go to PC and Steam if you end up with that rating.
1407040	1413120	So would there be officially sanctioned porn on PlayStation VR, too?
1413320	1417040	No. But what Loki is alluding to is there
1417040	1419840	if there was a web browser, could we get porn? Of course.
1421240	1424440	Bobby Blackwell says the PlayStation five has the ability to show
1424440	1426200	and interact with web pages.
1426200	1428640	But I can't remember if you can access the web browser directly
1428640	1429560	and give it a URL.
1429560	1432440	Well, I'm sure if if porn is involved.
1433280	1435680	Somebody will figure it out.
1435680	1440200	Bet. All right, let's move on
1440520	1444480	and talk about our gaming weeks, porn games or otherwise,
1444480	1447520	but I'm thinking everybody had a pretty PG rated week, but we'll see.
1447520	1450360	So let's go around and check out in on our gaming weeks.
1450600	1452760	Dark Soccer will start with you. How was your gaming week?
1454080	1455520	It was all right.
1455520	1457400	I played Dead by Daylight.
1457400	1459960	I played Final Fantasy five.
1459960	1462760	I am now on the next map of the game.
1464040	1467000	Cult of the Lamb, some pinball.
1469240	1472120	Played a little word scapes and kind of pissed off at them, though.
1474280	1476880	But mostly that.
1476880	1481440	And I've also taken up playing with 3D rendering software now.
1482200	1486000	So. Just. Just.
1487560	1492240	The usual. Actually, we picked up our Genesis
1492240	1494440	two mini arrived today.
1495240	1497360	We haven't hooked it up yet, but we got it.
1497360	1499960	And we're talking about getting the import. So.
1501080	1503520	Nice. It's little is very little.
1505920	1508040	All right. Well, let's go over to Loki.
1508200	1509400	How was your week?
1509800	1515120	Well, I tried to play different things, so I dusted off the literally
1515400	1517680	dusted off the DDR machine
1518680	1520880	to play some step mania.
1520960	1524840	And apparently something is up with the computer that I have in it.
1526200	1530960	It keeps crashing on me, which no, it's fine. It's fine.
1531000	1535640	I mean, it it's not the actual 573 board that's in there that that's
1535880	1537080	that's disconnected.
1537080	1539600	It's running off an actual PC right now.
1541400	1543560	It's still annoying. I don't know what's wrong with it.
1543560	1545120	There's not many parts to it.
1545200	1548800	It's like it's literally a NVMe
1549080	1553720	SSD card on a motherboard with a tiny bit of RAM and an APO.
1554040	1559720	So it's one of those probably didn't like being in the garage for years
1559880	1565400	in the, you know, the dam, the damp winters and the hot summers.
1566960	1568840	So it could be something minor.
1568840	1572800	It may even be just like the fact that the way I turn the machine on and off,
1572800	1576000	there's not like a way to like, you know, exit windows type thing.
1576000	1578560	You have to just hard turn it off most of the time.
1578880	1581000	And that can cause
1581000	1587480	file issues. The first crash I had on it was a it was like a graphics driver crash.
1587480	1592440	So I'm going to try a few things, but I may have to end up replacing that,
1593080	1596720	which is fine. I can go back to the actual arcade
1598560	1600680	and run that instead of step mania.
1601680	1604120	But, you know, I was just trying to trying to dust it off and.
1605200	1607160	Exercise like you should.
1609640	1611720	But yeah, so I did play
1611720	1615800	I played two and a half songs before it finally crashed the last time.
1617600	1618960	So there is that.
1618960	1621960	And then, of course, Minecraft is working on stuff this week.
1621960	1625840	I've put out an episode earlier today, though that's out there now
1626600	1628960	starting to get the robot masters in there now,
1629360	1633080	because if you don't know, I've been building in a Mega Man theme.
1633080	1638680	So we're having I'm creating eight unique robot masters for my series.
1639000	1641640	And so the first one, Creeper Man's got his
1642720	1643920	area being built out.
1643920	1647360	So I built a giant tree from a game I have not played yet.
1647360	1648600	Mega Man zero two.
1648600	1651640	It's I'm going to try to pronounce it because it's like Norse.
1651640	1654000	I think it's Yggdrasil.
1654640	1657720	Oh, yeah. And it's the tree of life.
1657760	1660360	And it's World Tree.
1660360	1661400	Yes, the World Tree.
1661400	1665200	So in, I guess, that game once again, haven't played it, don't know the lore.
1666040	1668720	I think I guess X has like trapped a dark elf.
1668720	1672160	I don't know where dark elves come for the Mega Man series,
1672160	1674120	but apparently there's dark elves now.
1674120	1677240	And so I based it sort of on that.
1677240	1680720	It's not exact one to one, but I just was kind of inspired by it
1680720	1682400	to make something. So I have that.
1682400	1685120	And then I've got some more designs being done.
1685120	1687160	I have three robot masters done right now.
1687160	1689160	There's one more being designed right now.
1689160	1693040	And then I'm getting 3D models made of them to put them in game.
1693400	1696960	So I have the first two of those almost done.
1696960	1700040	I've seen those, the finished models for them.
1700040	1703000	And I'm very excited to have them walking around.
1703000	1704160	My base is going to be awesome.
1704160	1706600	So that's in there as well.
1706600	1710320	But yeah, just be continued on building more stuff, of course, and
1711440	1712280	putting out more content.
1712280	1714000	I'm going to try to get some more YouTube shorts going.
1714000	1715960	I put a rendered one today.
1716000	1719560	I'm going to keep adding some more in there to try to boost the channel
1719560	1721280	because YouTube loves it.
1721280	1723240	Leverage those shorts on TikTok.
1723240	1728560	Alan started loading his Twitch clips to TikTok using some website,
1728560	1733760	and he's getting way more views on those than I would ever have thought.
1734080	1735840	TikTok is like pushing that stuff.
1735840	1737920	So yeah, Instagram too.
1737920	1739920	Yeah, the Instagram stories and stuff like that.
1739920	1742120	Bog Network has a TikTok now.
1742120	1745200	We haven't leveraged it for anything yet, but the ideas are cooking.
1746280	1749240	So here we go.
1749240	1750480	OK, let's see.
1750480	1754480	So I was just looking in chat at some of the other folks gave me weeks.
1754640	1756400	Tiger Claw was suggesting the power supply.
1756400	1757160	I don't know if you saw that.
1758480	1760000	I don't think it's the power supply.
1760000	1762400	I mean, it could be, but if it was the power supply,
1762400	1765320	you would think that it wouldn't just crash after a little bit.
1765320	1769120	It is running and like the power supply.
1770160	1771240	I think it's fine.
1771240	1775880	It could be, but typically if it's a power supply, it just wouldn't turn on.
1776800	1778720	Not just like crash randomly.
1778720	1782200	And the power supply is way over like it's like a
1782880	1785280	I think it's like a 430 watt power supply.
1785280	1788800	And it's only running like an APU with like nothing.
1788800	1793200	Like it's just it's it's way too much for what it actually needs.
1793520	1795640	So I don't think it's going to be an issue there.
1795640	1801120	But more likely, it's either why I think might have happened.
1801120	1805600	It could be a heat issue where the cooling
1805600	1808240	and expanding of the thing might have like
1809600	1813560	I may need to tighten down the the heat sink on the CPU.
1814360	1817720	It could be just I need to reload step mania again.
1817720	1821080	I have to boot it up outside of step mania and see if it crashes
1821360	1824640	after like a little bit of time because it didn't take long for the crash.
1825640	1829400	So if it crashes outside of step mania, I know it's something not related to that.
1830160	1832320	And I just have to check like,
1832320	1835320	you know, are there any file errors and stuff like that?
1835320	1840000	It could be something not a lot of parts to replace on that.
1840000	1842440	So it should be pretty easy to fix that.
1843880	1845400	There's other ideas in chat there.
1845400	1848880	Look, if you want to take a picture, I'm talking about machines.
1848880	1849840	I'll get into my gaming week.
1849840	1854520	So I went over to round one in Roseville real quick.
1854520	1856080	It was just really like run in and run out.
1856080	1858120	I was trying to get a new EMU's card
1858120	1860760	because I couldn't find my old one, which is so irritating.
1861000	1863680	I thought for sure once I bought a new one, the old one would pop up.
1863680	1865200	But it still hasn't yet.
1865240	1869320	But I went over there and they had the brand new 2DX resident or,
1869320	1873200	you know, which 2DX 30th style for us old school fans.
1873200	1875240	But, you know, they give them all actual names now.
1875240	1876480	So I got to see a little bit of that.
1876480	1878480	And, you know, some of the other games that they had there, we were just
1878480	1880880	we were really just in and out of there for like two seconds,
1881720	1884080	because then we went over to.
1884080	1887240	So this is a newer friend of mine who really follows like all these
1887240	1890720	Bamani and music games and, you know, has is a private collector,
1890960	1893680	went over to another friend's house out in that area
1893680	1896680	who is also a private collector, small world.
1896800	1899920	Somebody I met once with dark soccer
1899920	1903000	and I texted you the details like 12 years ago,
1903320	1907360	went over to this person's house and this person was setting up
1907360	1910000	their brand new you beat machine that they just got.
1910200	1911560	And so I got to play around to you beat.
1911560	1913400	And they also had a reflect beat, actually.
1913400	1917480	So I was like, this is just I was like, dang, there's all these.
1917480	1919480	I thought like Loki was one of the only people in town
1919480	1920880	that had like a machine in their house.
1920880	1923200	But no, there's a whole scene of like private.
1923520	1924800	Oh, there's lots of people. Oh, yeah.
1924800	1926680	No, I'm I'm learning that real quick.
1926680	1927600	There's lots of.
1927600	1930280	Meanwhile, you know, my friends like, what are you going to get a machine?
1930280	1934120	And I'm like, I've got I've got my BurgerTime replica.
1934360	1937360	And at some point I'll probably get a Tron replica.
1937600	1939640	Maybe Santa will bring me one. Who knows?
1940160	1941920	So at some point there'll be a Tron replica here.
1941920	1944160	And then that's that's probably.
1945480	1946480	That's that's going to be it.
1946480	1948520	I don't see myself fitting in a music game in here.
1948520	1950440	It's a little noisy, I think so.
1950600	1952480	Way too much pinball.
1952480	1954600	Oh, man, a pinball machine would be really fun.
1954600	1956600	I really it's a bummer.
1956600	1958480	Like, we have to borrow one.
1958480	1959240	Well, it's a bummer.
1959240	1961680	We have to park our cars in the garage because otherwise
1961680	1964200	I would be very willing to put that kind of stuff in the garage.
1964200	1966080	But we have no space because the cars.
1967040	1969720	So, yeah, let's see.
1969720	1971520	Looking in chat, Dr.
1971520	1972840	Seuss, it sounds like a fun time.
1972840	1974640	Yeah, it was as 200.
1974640	1977480	Matt says, I remember nearly breaking my back,
1977480	1981040	dragging why our technical machine up three flights of stairs.
1981240	1983560	Luckily, these guys lived on the bottom floor,
1983920	1987040	so there was no stairs involved or actually they had a place
1987040	1988560	that like the stairs were in it.
1988560	1990440	So you had a bottom floor.
1990440	1992400	So and that's where everything was.
1992400	1993000	Oh, yeah.
1993000	1994720	Bobby Black Wolf and chat brings up.
1994720	1996600	I played pinball this week.
1996600	1999920	Bobby Black Wolf is very excited and is writing a very large high
1999920	2003560	because he finally dethroned me from his own pinball machine,
2003560	2005320	his rush pinball machine.
2005320	2007920	You might remember when I was out there visiting, I took the high score.
2008200	2011680	Bobby, Bobby was a little salty, a little salty about that.
2011680	2016680	And he but he played and played and played, played and played.
2017080	2019640	And he just thrown my score, my lucky streak.
2019640	2021440	So he has his score back.
2021440	2023960	So you all know what this means.
2023960	2026680	Number one, I should no longer be banned from that arcade.
2027120	2029200	So take my picture down.
2029200	2033480	Except I guess I'm still I'm still the lead of the Tron thing,
2033480	2034640	so maybe there's that.
2034640	2038640	But number two, I just have to beat it at Dragon Con 2023.
2038640	2042760	I now have a new bar to hit in 2023 when I go back.
2045680	2046080	Let's see.
2046080	2048960	So other stuff for my gaming week besides
2048960	2051080	machines, arcade machines and fun things like that.
2051960	2052840	A lot of the same.
2052840	2055160	I also been playing quite a bit of Dead by Daylight.
2055160	2058400	I really was trying to grind out the Halloween event before it was done.
2058720	2062040	Didn't finish the tomes because I didn't play quite enough Dead by Daylight,
2062280	2063880	but I farmed enough blood points.
2063880	2065640	I was up to like a million and a half blood points
2065640	2069360	where I was able to finish prestigeing Hattie and Yoonjin.
2069360	2070040	I finished prestige.
2070040	2072040	I'm trying to get every survivor,
2072040	2074720	except for the Stranger Things kids for now,
2075000	2078720	every other survivor to level one prestige so I can get their perks.
2080160	2083600	Yeah, with the Stranger Things license and the changes they made with that,
2084120	2087320	Steve and Nancy no longer have transferable perks.
2087320	2089480	So they're they're lowest on the priority.
2089840	2093760	I'm putting some in Steve just to get him enough to 15.
2093760	2098280	So I have four slots open because I have a Escape with Steve challenge.
2098720	2102040	OK, so so I have to invest in the Stoven.
2103080	2104160	There you go.
2104160	2106520	But yeah, I've been been enjoying that.
2106520	2108600	I did a stream the other night to whatever.
2109440	2111560	I also stream No Man's Sky,
2111560	2115560	which I am really, really enjoying relaxed mode in No Man's Sky.
2115880	2118000	It's really kind of reinvigorated the game for me
2118000	2120720	because I'm able to kind of.
2120720	2123280	It's not that I minded the grind in the game before,
2123280	2125360	but like to have that really eliminated.
2126760	2128440	Just makes it so much easier
2128440	2132000	to really feel like you're making progress and kind of pushing forward.
2132240	2135360	And I think what I'd like to do is really kind of try to set up a really nice.
2135600	2137720	I think I'm going to even though on stream
2137720	2140240	I've been setting up a pretty nice base on a planet.
2140440	2143560	What I'm really trying to do is get to the center of the galaxy
2143560	2147280	where somewhat spoiler alert, I don't think this is a spoiler.
2147840	2151480	You unlock other galaxies at the end of the game, basically.
2151880	2154160	So I want to travel to one of the other galaxies,
2154160	2157160	which spawns the paradise planets more frequently
2157400	2159840	and try to establish a base on one of the paradise
2160360	2163920	planets in the new galaxy and like do a super base type of thing.
2164920	2166760	So that's like my goal in the game right now.
2166760	2168080	But I still have a long way to go.
2168080	2172640	I'm assuming they're going to drop a new expedition on us relatively soon,
2172640	2175640	because if they don't, we're getting to the time of year
2175640	2178520	where they're probably going to recycle the old expeditions.
2178920	2183920	So I if they're going to drop like a six week expedition on us,
2183920	2187920	they need to do it next week unless they're planning another really short one.
2187920	2190280	Maybe they're going to do a tie in with another game again.
2190280	2191200	So it's going to be short.
2191200	2193080	I I don't know what it would be.
2193080	2195520	But I mean, they did do the Normandy when
2196600	2198600	the Mass Effect trilogy came out.
2198600	2200560	So fingers and toes crossed.
2200560	2202880	Maybe something can happen there, but we'll see.
2202880	2204680	So waiting on that.
2204680	2207960	And then more Final Fantasy 14, because I always play that game.
2207960	2211000	And yeah, a lot of the lot of the same old, same old stuff.
2211560	2213720	So not not a lot of new games this week.
2213720	2216600	But I will I will also make sure I get around to something new this week,
2216600	2218760	except I am leaving town on Thursday.
2219000	2220320	This is we don't have a show next week
2220320	2222720	that gives me two weeks to play something new. So we'll see.
2223120	2226400	So I did want to mention something real quick that I noticed
2226400	2229000	and more of an observation. So
2229960	2233120	a fellow podcaster in the area that we've met before.
2233120	2236080	David Webb had his had his kid last month.
2236440	2240040	So congratulations to them for their baby girl.
2240280	2243640	But it is it dawned on me, though, that I saw a message
2243640	2246520	from him on Twitter that says I miss podcasting.
2246680	2248880	I really wish I could go back to that. I was like, wait a second.
2248880	2252600	Aren't you on the Sacramento's number one gaming podcast?
2253560	2256440	Well, apparently they haven't been doing a podcast for a year.
2257280	2260160	So I guess by default, that means we're the number one
2260160	2262320	Sacramento gaming podcast now.
2262320	2265480	Yeah. Stop starting shit.
2266320	2270160	No, because I understand that they're they're really busy in there.
2270240	2271840	They're they are.
2271840	2276240	Corey. Yeah, I always I always love to remind Corey.
2276240	2280480	I guessed it on that episode and I was telling you what Overwatch was all about.
2280480	2282320	I always love to give him shit over that.
2282320	2285560	So but I mean, in all seriousness, like congrats to the best for them.
2285560	2288160	I just yeah, it's a hard time. Yeah.
2288160	2290840	So that's amazing.
2290840	2295080	All right. Prince Peach fuzz and chat says Loki makes a great point.
2295640	2296440	So I don't know.
2296440	2299280	I guess we'll get a banner made and go to a convention and make it official.
2299280	2299840	I don't know.
2300440	2303280	Didn't what did we already establish when that whole, you know,
2303280	2307600	when we were just, you know, and obviously they've been on this or they went there
2307600	2309280	when, you know, I thought that they were on this show.
2309280	2310280	I was on that show.
2310280	2311920	Like, it's whatever.
2311920	2313720	It's funny.
2313720	2316440	But I was going to say
2318200	2319000	the train derailed.
2319000	2320520	I was going to say, oh, yeah.
2320520	2324480	Didn't we at that time say, well, we don't need to be the number one podcast here
2324480	2327120	because we're the number one podcast in the galaxy.
2327400	2329240	We're the galaxy's number one podcast.
2329240	2332560	I think somebody actually wrote that in an iTunes review at some point.
2332560	2334800	So it's fine.
2334800	2336400	It's just it's just silly.
2336400	2338960	It was it was just funny. Yeah. All right.
2340080	2342400	Let's get into some more gaming news
2342400	2345960	and some other headlines from the week and we'll go to Loki.
2347160	2350240	I want to be surprised, but I'm not surprised.
2350360	2355320	But PlayStation Plus is apparently has lost nearly two million subscribers
2355640	2358640	after their relaunch and multiple tier thing.
2358640	2362240	That was utterly confusing and promised a bunch of stuff from PlayStation
2362240	2364360	now, which I absolutely don't want.
2364360	2366800	Like, I really don't like PlayStation now.
2366800	2368040	And I think it was dumb.
2368040	2370240	And I knew that they were going to offer like,
2370240	2373200	you know, the PlayStation one games just give us backwards compatibility.
2373200	2374560	Is it so hard?
2374560	2376320	Like people already have libraries of that stuff.
2376320	2378440	Why should we have to pay for backwards compatibility?
2378880	2381000	Well, apparently, though,
2382400	2385640	I think one of the problems is a lot of the classic games
2385640	2390240	that they have promised to bring out have been like slowly like droopy.
2390240	2392880	It's like almost like the Nintendo online stuff
2393400	2396120	where it's just slow to come out because.
2397280	2400000	Licensing, I'm sure.
2400000	2403080	But yeah, confusion with the overlapping tiers
2403080	2405520	and, you know, with subscribers
2406080	2410200	over which tiers of which era of games that they got and stuff like that.
2412120	2413280	You know, apparently now
2413280	2418120	it is the most expensive tier is actually increased as well.
2418120	2419400	It's up 10 percent.
2421400	2426640	And, you know, the revenue that they're bringing in is it's going up,
2426640	2430040	but it's just the number of subscribers is kind of declining.
2430960	2433280	In the second quarter, we renewed our services
2433280	2436560	and there has been great momentum as a whole, and this is coming from.
2438200	2441120	Was it a Hiroki to Toki,
2441560	2445680	who is making his comment on an earnings call, the CFO,
2446120	2449400	and basically said in the second quarter, yeah, we renewed our services
2449400	2453000	and there's been a great momentum as a whole before laying some of
2453640	2457560	they were saying lanes of the blame on the lack of aggressive ad spending
2458080	2460440	for the service, which is true.
2460440	2465360	I don't see any advertisements for PlayStation Plus,
2465960	2469520	but I just think, you know, as far as what I'm getting with PlayStation
2469520	2474840	Plus versus like, say, Game Pass, it's just seems to be a lot less.
2475400	2478320	I guess like I kind of made a face and you're talking about the advertising
2478320	2480200	because I'm like, as if gamers don't know.
2480200	2484080	But at the same time, I am thinking like, OK, well, like right now
2485080	2488600	Microsoft is like literally running a promotion with Twitch,
2489280	2492000	where if you give and I'm not saying this to be self-serving, I promise.
2492000	2495120	But like if you give two gift subs or something like that, or you
2495200	2500200	you do two subs on that, you get like a few months of PC game pass for free,
2500480	2502200	except right catch.
2502200	2504520	It's only for new subscribers.
2504520	2507520	It's not for you can't just add the time to an existing thing.
2507520	2512480	So it's really it's really a lot a longer trial than like 48 hours,
2512520	2515080	which is their usual giveaway trial for that type of stuff.
2515800	2518600	They'll do like a month with like discourse or something like that.
2518600	2519480	Like there's a lot of that.
2519480	2521160	I haven't seen PlayStation do any of that.
2521160	2524080	So I will say, OK, yeah, that in that now that I think about it,
2524080	2526760	like in that sense of advertising, yeah, they're really lacking.
2527400	2531120	They need to do they have this PlayStation even have a PC component to it.
2531120	2533440	Like, can I play?
2533440	2538560	You did, so there is PPS remote play that will allow you
2538560	2541800	like it's a desktop app that will allow you to connect to your PlayStation.
2542000	2544120	I would run it right now and show you a live demo
2544120	2545640	because I have it on my desktop and I've used it.
2545640	2548640	However, because it makes traffic go through your router
2548640	2551320	like a lot with the streaming, I don't want it might affect the program.
2551320	2553040	So I'm going to run it right now.
2553040	2557480	But it's it's it's just like running the PlayStation in a window on your desktop.
2557520	2558280	It's extremely great.
2558280	2561680	But like they have PC games, though, so they couldn't.
2561680	2563880	They have like a PC.
2563880	2569120	They cried of it that were like I could play God of War without having to buy it.
2569200	2574000	Sony, the company could enhance a lot because they could also give.
2574000	2576160	And I said this a long fucking time ago.
2576160	2579560	And again, I don't understand why these companies are so siloed
2579920	2583200	because they can give away movies.
2583880	2586240	They can give away television shows.
2586240	2590240	Crunchyroll, you know, the things that are in Sony's wheelhouse.
2590240	2592280	They could they could partner with all that stuff.
2592280	2594560	And I think they do for trial because I know somebody is going to say
2594560	2596360	you can't get a crunchyroll trial.
2596360	2596960	You know what I mean?
2596960	2600120	Like there should be things that are incorporated in that,
2600120	2602600	like a true entertainment pass.
2602840	2604040	And I'm just kind of surprised.
2604040	2606760	It seems like a missed opportunity there. So.
2609560	2611560	Oh, well, I mean,
2611560	2615040	they'll have to figure out something if they're really interested in retaining.
2615160	2618680	I'm not sure what percentage the two million was of their total subscribers,
2618680	2623760	but that's not a like, you know, they apparently see here.
2623760	2627560	So it's mentioning a games pass has 25 million subscribers.
2628160	2630160	I guess this isn't a huge chunk then.
2630160	2636240	So PlayStation Plus last summer had 48 million customers.
2636480	2639880	I and I'm just going to say what's been holding me back on.
2639880	2642720	I've never I never signed up for the expanded sub.
2642720	2645080	I'm still on just the regular PlayStation Plus.
2645280	2648960	And to be quite honest, I don't even know why I barely you know,
2648960	2651880	a lot of my gaming is switched to PC over the last few years.
2652880	2656280	You know, again, when stuff like Final Fantasy 16 and some of the other
2656280	2659840	exclusives, I'm interested in the, you know, God of War Ragnarok and stuff.
2660320	2663720	Once that stuff comes out, you know, I certainly will probably change my answer.
2663720	2669960	But I part of why I've resisted not signing up for the expanded service
2669960	2674120	is that I just I think the retro offerings especially are pathetic
2674560	2677320	for what Sony has access to in their library.
2677560	2680040	I think their retro offerings are downright pathetic.
2680600	2683600	Yeah. And they really need to up their game.
2683600	2686040	I mean, we give Nintendo a lot of crap,
2686280	2690760	but at least to Nintendo's credit, as far as NES and Super Nintendo go,
2691080	2695520	pretty much any first party title that doesn't have a licensing twist
2695520	2697560	to it is now on the switch.
2698200	2701400	Anything that's like a game where you're like, God, I really want this game
2701400	2704320	is probably I'm sure somebody is going to think of a first party game
2704320	2705520	that escapes me right now.
2705520	2708240	But for the most part, again, if it's a licensing issue, that's different.
2708440	2710640	But for the most part, first party games are all there now.
2710800	2713840	It's the third party stuff that, you know, anything you want, like,
2713840	2716960	you know, more Castlevania games or something they're lacking
2716960	2719120	because the third parties aren't jumping on that.
2719120	2722920	And so I really feel like Sony's service
2723280	2725640	has very minimal third party representation
2725640	2728080	and it's still missing a ton of first party games.
2728080	2732160	So for me, that's why it hasn't caught on for me personally.
2734720	2737640	Anyway, let's move on.
2737640	2742040	We'll talk about what's going on with streaming over on Xbox
2742520	2745560	with the xCloud, which, of course, is another streaming solution.
2746240	2750120	And xCloud is something that you can run on Steam Deck and Chrome OS
2750120	2752280	as some different places.
2752280	2755640	And if you are using xCloud through one of those services,
2755960	2759720	you are getting a little bit of an upgrade because now there is a higher
2759720	2762600	resolution that's being pushed to those platforms.
2763360	2766120	An Xbox employee on Windows Center, excuse me,
2766880	2769840	wrote on Reddit and then Windows Central did the original report on this.
2770440	2773520	An Xbox employee wrote on Reddit that the update is an end
2773520	2776240	of a transition to a different type of streaming tech.
2776560	2779120	They did not go into the details about what that is.
2779680	2783040	But basically, if you use a browser to get to xCloud gaming,
2783240	2786280	even if that's iOS on your phone or iPad, whatever it is,
2786480	2789720	you're going to have what they call a more consistent experience.
2790000	2794080	So remember, you know, xCloud works on a lot of different places.
2794840	2797640	Meta plans to bring it to the MetaQuest 2 as well.
2798440	2799680	So there is that.
2799680	2803840	But yeah, Microsoft is also said to be eager for Steam Deck users
2803840	2805720	to access the xCloud gaming.
2805720	2808400	There is not an official Xbox app for the system yet,
2808400	2812440	but there is a guide for setting up the service on Stream Deck.
2812480	2815040	So it's not often you see a company like Microsoft
2815040	2818000	kind of embrace a guide on how to do a work around.
2818280	2820440	But you know what? They want to get people on the cloud.
2820440	2821880	That's what they're going to do.
2821880	2823920	So I like xCloud.
2823920	2826520	I don't use a lot of cloud gaming right now
2826520	2828840	just because I did buy a nice computer
2828840	2831440	where I don't really need to leverage the cloud for a lot right now.
2831760	2836720	But I like that there's a lot of games available on it and so forth.
2836960	2842320	I like that Microsoft is being very aware about trying to get it everywhere
2842320	2845680	and that by them publishing a guide like here's how to get it on Steam Deck,
2845920	2848640	like they know that's a huge opportunity for them
2848640	2851160	is to get on those Steam Decks and expand people's library.
2851160	2852680	I think that's just really smart.
2852680	2857600	So She Hulk 10 and chat along with 100 biddies.
2857600	2858480	So thank you very much.
2858480	2861240	Says the cloud is the future. Don't fight it.
2861640	2864480	I do agree. The cloud is the future.
2865520	2868040	It's, I think, a little slower to take
2868440	2871040	than maybe most people are waiting, you know, ready for.
2871040	2872800	But again, I've said this a long time.
2872800	2875680	When 5G is more widely available in the US,
2876440	2879040	cloud gaming is going to really take off.
2879040	2882160	Just a matter of time, and we're going to see more games like
2882680	2885840	you know, the promised upcoming Hideo Kojima game.
2886080	2890400	Not to get too much into what's up next, but Kojima has mentioned
2890840	2894920	he's working with Microsoft on something that incorporates new cloud technology.
2894920	2899200	So you're going to see games that incorporate cloud technology.
2899720	2902760	But before I say too much, let's go to our next story from Dark Sakura.
2904600	2909480	There has been footage leaked of Kojima's unannounced game.
2909480	2915520	They show the video with a character
2915520	2918760	who looks like Margaret Qualley, who was in Death Stranding.
2920760	2922960	And there's a jump scare that says game over
2922960	2927000	and then a Hideo Kojima game and then overdose.
2928120	2932120	So, of course, Kojima Pro requested it to be removed.
2934680	2938520	But this may be related to
2938680	2942080	when he was saying he's watching horror movies, prepping for a future project.
2944200	2947800	And then the fact that he said he is working on a cloud based
2947800	2950360	project with Xbox, this could very well be it.
2951680	2954440	I don't know if you actually got to see the video
2954440	2956480	because something really funny happens in it.
2956480	2960520	But like in the leaked video, once the overdose logo comes up,
2960520	2962480	it's on the mostly black screen.
2962480	2966640	So the monitor is reflective and you can see the person filming.
2966640	2968800	It is some dude without a shirt.
2969720	2971400	You can't you can't see his face.
2971400	2976640	So you just see man boobs like staring you in the face
2977240	2978760	next to the overdose logo.
2978760	2980600	And I'm like, that's the jump scare.
2981680	2984760	And I didn't know.
2984760	2987000	Of course, I watched the footage.
2987000	2989080	I had to. I didn't.
2989920	2995000	Also, though, has been confirmation by Norman Reedus
2995000	2999600	that there is a sequel confirmed for Death Stranding in the works.
3001040	3002840	So interesting.
3002840	3006880	Well, the game awards are going to be sooner rather than later.
3006880	3009040	Believe it or not, that's going to be in like a month.
3009040	3013600	So I would guess if I have a new Hideo Kojima game to announce,
3014280	3017800	that might be the place to do it, because, you know, Kojima and Jeff Keighley,
3019040	3020200	they're best buds.
3020200	3023040	So that would be the place to see it.
3023400	3027640	And I wonder if that leaked footage from shirtless dude
3027920	3033200	wasn't some type of early footage to practice with the game awards.
3033240	3036320	So I wonder if the shirtless dude isn't somebody that works for Keighley
3036320	3038240	or somebody on that. I mean, who knows?
3038240	3041840	Or the whole thing could be a really fucking elaborate hoax,
3041840	3043480	which sometimes these things turn into.
3043480	3046400	But I don't know that was if it's a hoax.
3046680	3048800	It was a really well done hoax.
3048800	3051480	But there are other ways to post shirtless selfies
3051640	3053480	on your body progress to the Internet.
3053480	3055080	I'm just saying there are other way.
3055080	3056520	Get get get it.
3056520	3058280	Tumblr is cool with that.
3058280	3061520	Now get a tumbler.
3061520	3063440	The debate that they tumble back in that direction.
3063440	3067360	They tumbled back into not not hardcore pornography,
3067360	3069840	but artistic nudes are OK now.
3070200	3073440	So if you want to celebrate the human form, I'm trying to remember what they said.
3073440	3075520	They're going to celebrate the human form.
3076160	3079720	If you're like, I woke up like this and you have a boner
3079760	3081960	that you're posting on Tumblr, you can do that now.
3082600	3084920	But you cannot post.
3085320	3087400	But no one wants to see that.
3087400	3091200	Yeah. Well, I don't want to see that.
3091360	3095200	I was going to say the Internet, keep your body parts in your bedroom.
3096360	3098440	Use use hashtags.
3098440	3101960	So Jamie, commute the one she doesn't want to see or anyone for that matter.
3103960	3107360	Tiger Claw on chat says, Watch the new game be Death Stranding 2.
3107560	3111720	Why? I mean, couldn't the two games be the same thing?
3112400	3114960	Couldn't it be Death Stranding 2 overdose?
3115440	3117000	I know it's a stretch.
3117000	3119200	Who's to say Death Stranding 2 can't be a horror game?
3119320	3122080	We've seen games cross genres as sequels before.
3124120	3125480	Just a thought. It could.
3125480	3128840	I mean, but I know it's a stretch, but it could anyway.
3129960	3133560	Speaking of things that are a stretch.
3133560	3137080	Is it really a stretch in this year of 2022?
3137080	3139160	Convincing me to buy it is the stretch.
3139400	3144040	Oh, yeah, they're really stretchy like taffy.
3145680	3149160	So Square Enix has decided, hey, we're going to announce
3149160	3152840	our brand new NFT collectible art project.
3152880	3157080	Oh, yeah. I know you guys are super hyped for symbiogenesis.
3157840	3159760	I know that Parasite Eve reboot.
3159760	3163120	By the sound of that, you think it's Parasite Eve, but no, no.
3163320	3166960	The only parasite we're going to be putting out in the world
3167400	3170200	is the ask for cryptocurrency and,
3170760	3173400	you know, these profile pics that you might be able to use with this.
3174800	3177720	But yeah, apparently it's art that
3178560	3181560	some sort of art project that you'll be able to.
3182760	3186640	Untangle some story and get NFTs,
3186640	3189560	and it's a big old scam sounding thing, so.
3190720	3194080	Yeah, I'm not not excited about that at all,
3194080	3196640	and I think it's stupid and I hope it flops.
3196640	3199120	I hope it fails so fast.
3200680	3203920	All right. Well, Square Enix has not had a good week
3203920	3206720	and not even Yoshi P could save Square Enix from this week,
3206720	3209200	even though he's saved the Final Fantasy franchise.
3210080	3213400	He's not immune from having some really bad trade
3213480	3215600	takes trademark patent pending.
3215880	3219920	And boy, was there one this week and there was a new IGN interview
3220200	3223840	that was posted with Naoki Yoshida talking about some things
3223840	3225960	about Final Fantasy 16.
3225960	3228440	But the portion that's gotten a lot of people's attention
3228960	3233400	has to do with his answer when he was confronted with the question.
3233400	3237440	Basically, you know, we've had all these trailers for Final Fantasy 16.
3238600	3240800	Are there going to be black people in the game?
3240800	3242640	Are there going to be a diverse
3243480	3245520	group of people in Final Fantasy 16?
3245520	3247600	Because we're not seeing him in the trailer.
3247600	3252200	And in a really long answer, Yoshi P basically said no.
3253200	3255120	In part, here's an excerpt.
3255120	3258120	Ultimately, we felt that while incorporating ethnic diversity
3258120	3262240	into vallustesia, I think is the name of the world there was important,
3262440	3266080	an over incorporation into the single corner of a much larger world
3266080	3268800	could end up causing a violation of those narrative boundaries
3269040	3271000	we originally set for ourselves.
3271000	3275040	The story we are telling is fantasy, yes, but it's also rooted in reality.
3275520	3280720	So basically, I'm going to really liberally cut edges here.
3280720	3284520	But what I'm hearing out of what Yoshi P was saying was basically
3285360	3288920	we're trying to make something that emulates Game of Thrones.
3289400	3293200	And because. In medieval Europe,
3293200	3296440	it was pretty white, we kept our game pretty white.
3296880	3300960	And of course, a lot of people, a lot of people, a lot of people.
3301960	3304440	Are correct to quickly point out a few things.
3304960	3309640	Number one, there actually was diversity in medieval Europe.
3310280	3315360	There were quite a few persons of many colors.
3316560	3321640	In fact, a few even were nobles.
3324040	3327360	And yeah, Dark Tetsuya says,
3327360	3330160	I know Square Enix has been struggling with this for years.
3330160	3334040	I mean, in 16 games, there's been what, three POC that I can think of?
3334920	3337280	Yeah, hold that thought for a minute,
3337280	3339520	because I'm going to come back to that in a minute.
3339520	3344080	But yeah, obviously there's that, that, you know,
3344080	3347320	yes, there actually were diverse people in medieval Europe.
3348040	3352400	Number two, I guess, though, if you were to go to Game of Thrones,
3352640	3356280	which this game is clearly trying to emulate, while yes,
3356280	3361160	there were characters of color in Game of Thrones,
3361760	3365920	they many would argue they were not really main characters
3365920	3368440	that were utilized as well as they could have been.
3369360	3372200	So perhaps if that goal is to emulate Game of Thrones,
3372200	3374640	then that's a little more what they're doing.
3374640	3376680	But also, it should be pointed out.
3376680	3381400	And many people, again, are pointing out your game is Final Fantasy.
3382680	3387280	Fantasy, why are you so hell bent on rooting it in reality?
3387280	3390120	You can't say your game is rooted in reality
3390400	3393720	while you're showing off a trailer of ice lady
3393720	3397160	throwing icicles at giant rock man fighting.
3397160	3399480	I mean, hello.
3399480	3403640	And you ride giant chickens, so I mean, come on. Yeah.
3404960	3409880	So obviously there are some problems with what Yoshi P said this week.
3411040	3413360	Now, before I come back for some other comments,
3413600	3416520	I want to go to another story involving Square Enix.
3418000	3421080	I think some of this may have been from last week.
3421080	3424920	I'm going to say it anyway, because the the side I'm looking at here,
3424920	3428840	VG charts just published it six days ago anyway.
3428840	3431200	So it's it's from this week.
3431200	3433480	Square Enix president and director
3433480	3438240	Yosuke Matsuda in the 2022 annual report for Square Enix says
3438640	3441040	it is difficult to achieve growth for companies
3441040	3443560	that primarily focus on the Japanese gaming industry.
3443760	3446320	And it is important for Square Enix to offer games
3446320	3449600	that will be popular worldwide in a quote.
3450360	3453760	Director Yasuke Matsuda said, achieving major growth in the game
3453760	3456480	industry is difficult now for companies that compete
3456680	3460960	primarily in the Japanese market, given its graying demographics.
3461320	3465000	As such, it is critical for our business that we produce hit titles
3465160	3468240	that speak to the global market, which offers greater scale
3468240	3470520	in terms of both customers and sales volumes.
3471000	3473960	Furthermore, game development efforts are becoming more sizable
3473960	3476920	and sophisticated as the result of technological advancements
3476920	3480560	in the devices on which they are played, such as consoles or smart devices.
3480880	3483600	The investment required to develop game titles is therefore
3483640	3486160	an order of magnitude greater than in the past.
3486760	3490000	In other words, the Japanese market is no longer sufficient
3490200	3493560	for achieving a level of earnings that enables us to recoup
3493760	3496040	our development investment and generate a profit.
3496200	3498600	And we therefore need to approach our development efforts
3498760	3502000	based on the assumption that we have to succeed in the global market.
3504160	3504800	Mr.
3506160	3509200	Yosuke Matsudasan.
3509200	3512640	The answer is right in front of you.
3513600	3520800	Because I would say, while Yoshi P made a bad statement this week.
3522800	3526200	There's a lot of people on Twitter doing what Twitter usually and I'm
3526200	3528680	not even going to walk into the garbage fire of what a lot of
3528680	3530960	Twitter is this week, I'm just going to talk social media in general.
3531560	3536080	There's a lot of people ready to cancel Yoshi P for what he said.
3537400	3541040	And while I'm sure I think Yoshi P should be accountable for what he said,
3541680	3549320	I think canceling him is extremely, extremely short-sighted of the real problem.
3553560	3554440	And what am I getting at?
3555360	3561000	The real problem is a lot of Japanese studios don't get it.
3562040	3569640	Because Japan hasn't had a lot of the same discussions in their country
3570000	3571400	that we've had in this country.
3573280	3580440	There's quite a bit of, for lack of a better description, it's, it's
3582520	3587280	unaware racism, like they still have people who perform in blackface.
3588400	3592240	They, they have all kinds of appropriative action.
3592240	3595840	But then again, I mean, you look societally, like most of the society
3595840	3598920	there was appropriated from other places at its formation.
3599440	3604680	But, um, but, but going back to it, it's, it's a cultural issue.
3604920	3607960	It's, it's something that has to be seen through a more complex lens.
3608360	3612680	And with any cultural issue and including our own issues here with,
3612680	3616320	with racism and bigotry, you have to dismantle the foundation.
3616600	3616800	Yep.
3617480	3624360	You know, so it's ridiculous, but it's where you have to start.
3624640	3624880	Yeah.
3624920	3629360	But the reason why I brought up what, you know, Yasuke Masuda said was
3629360	3635520	because in my view, these things are very closely aligned is that he's
3635520	3638640	sitting here saying, how do we succeed in a global market?
3640120	3643040	And then a statement like this comes out of his company this week.
3644360	3645440	That's the answer.
3645680	3646560	Start there.
3647520	3651520	Because if Japan wants to, Japanese developers want to succeed in the
3651520	3657680	global market, then they also need to open up to this because let's be real.
3657760	3660120	This is not just an issue of Final Fantasy 16.
3662160	3664600	Did y'all not look at the cast of Final Fantasy 15?
3666240	3669560	This isn't an issue just dedicated to the Final Fantasy series.
3670560	3672040	Y'all ever played Genshin Impact?
3672040	3673720	Fantasy 6 had more diversity.
3674800	3678880	So there's a lot, and I'm not going to say every Japanese developer does this
3678880	3682480	because you all will name games that have done better diversity and so forth.
3683480	3690280	And Rama, if you want to call in now, I'll take your call now.
3692120	3697880	But this is something that Japan, you know, Japanese developers need
3697880	3699560	to address on a wider scale.
3700680	3702280	Some other comments in chat here.
3703840	3707920	Tiger Cloud Chat says, if it's emulating Game of Thrones, this means they also
3707920	3710720	have to emulate the sex that is associated with it.
3711200	3715720	I guess a fair point as to, you know, leaving some things out or what have you.
3715720	3720400	So, which child's getting thrown out the window or into the, into the fire.
3720400	3721960	Was that Game of Thrones or was that another show?
3722120	3724120	That gif of the baby getting thrown in the fire.
3724120	3724920	Was that Game of Thrones?
3725480	3725880	I don't know.
3726640	3730360	Anyway, uh, let's see other comments from chat.
3730400	3733040	Um, it's fine though.
3733040	3736880	Cause that child that, you know, fell out the window, you know, he'll become king
3736880	3737720	someday, so it's fine.
3737760	3738120	Yeah.
3738840	3742240	Anyway, I want to bring Rama, I want to let Rama have a say on this as well.
3742560	3745880	Uh, so I'm going to go to discord where I believe Rama called in.
3747040	3748600	Hey, what's going on y'all?
3748680	3751680	Hey, not much, but we are talking about an issue.
3751760	3756840	Um, and you know, it does have to do with the representation of, uh, black
3756840	3758440	individuals in video games.
3758880	3760000	I'm not black Rama.
3761200	3761920	None of us are.
3762640	3764160	But I will say this.
3764480	3766400	You are gay as the day is long.
3766480	3769880	And even still Japan still has a slight issue with that.
3769920	3770360	Oh yeah.
3770400	3770760	Oh yeah.
3770800	3771280	I'm aware.
3771320	3771760	I'm aware.
3772320	3772640	Tell it.
3773640	3776600	And for the record, before I begin, I just want you to know, I'm just sitting
3776600	3778560	here, putting my laundry away.
3778560	3783160	I'm like, I got words to say, and then you go, feel free to call in.
3783160	3784320	I'm just like, God damn it.
3784320	3785280	I don't even have a shirt on.
3785280	3788760	I'm running around throwing a shirt on so I can be semi decent for y'all
3788760	3790480	because I love all of y'all.
3790680	3792760	You can, he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to make another
3792760	3794280	leaked pic of that one game.
3794320	3797760	So yeah, you don't want to have an overdose or problem here.
3798080	3800400	Uh, you can always not be on cam.
3800400	3800800	It's fine.
3800800	3804560	I know I, I kinda, but, but you know, your, your perspective for
3804560	3806160	many reasons is important.
3806160	3810680	I also, you know, because you have, you do anime jam session, I know you're
3810680	3812560	very familiar with Japanese culture.
3812760	3814560	That's, that's very much a reason.
3814560	3816160	I'd like to hear your take on this topic.
3816960	3817920	I will say this.
3817920	3821240	I have heard from people, you know, who have gone to Japan and talk about,
3821480	3824960	oh, how in Japan, they kind of treat black people differently.
3825120	3831040	I'm like, you can be white as bread and they will still treat you differently.
3832120	3838040	A lot of the issues I hear in anime fandom is that Japan does not include
3838040	3842560	us in anime unless it's like a stereotype character and so forth.
3842880	3846840	Oddly enough, when it comes to video games, there were some rumblings
3846840	3852040	with Barrett Wallace, Saz, and Shadow the Hedgehog.
3854680	3860400	So, personally, I'm, I didn't have an issue with it, but it's what
3860400	3863160	they go off of and what is known.
3863840	3870320	Now, there are some people who have started their own anime studios in Japan.
3870640	3874520	They're like, you know what, if we can't get them to do what we want, I'm
3874520	3875960	going to make something for all of us.
3876200	3877360	Sometimes it works.
3877440	3878600	Sometimes it does not.
3879080	3883360	Part of the issue is Japan is seen as a xenophobic country.
3883840	3888920	Also, Japan only does, when it comes to manga, anime, video games, they
3888920	3894560	only go by what they know and they will pull from various texts
3894560	3897840	from history and just roll with it.
3899040	3903360	Personally, I just don't have an issue with it because I don't go down that
3903360	3908280	far down the rabbit hole, because if I did, I'd probably be talking
3908280	3911240	with y'all about this while we're in a kufi and a dashiki.
3912800	3916480	But you mentioned in chat, you don't really have an interest
3916480	3919040	in Fam SE 16 at this point until it's in the bargain bin.
3920080	3920720	Exactly.
3921120	3924080	I, as you know, I don't fully believe in cancel culture.
3924320	3927640	I believe people, they may mess up.
3927840	3932160	They should be allowed a chance at redemption, but that redemption
3932160	3936240	should fall on them, not do it because people want them to do it.
3938080	3938360	Sorry.
3938360	3940360	And I don't mean to interrupt, but I think it's important to state
3940360	3943760	and to set like expectations or whatever appropriately.
3944160	3948240	Final Fantasy 16 is not suddenly going to get a black character in it.
3948640	3951680	Like they're, they're pushing that game for summer of 2023.
3951880	3953920	That's, that's not going to happen at this point.
3953960	3956800	Like just, I, I, I'm not saying that's the right, I'm just saying
3956800	3959040	that's the realist thing, you know, especially when you hear these
3959040	3961920	comments about Square Enix is struggling a little bit, they're not
3961920	3963480	delaying this game for this.
3963760	3964880	So the game is coming out.
3965640	3967360	Maybe there is DLC.
3967640	3972400	I don't know, but I think this is something Square Enix needs to address
3973440	3977640	moving forward with future games than trying to necessarily fix this one.
3979320	3983240	I mean, you could make one of the main characters black in FF16
3983240	3984520	by doing a palette swap.
3985400	3986840	Some people will be happy about that.
3987000	3989840	Others will be, and you're into the crap.
3989880	3990080	Yeah.
3990080	3991320	Some people will take issue with that too.
3991560	3995800	You know what, you know, it's worth bringing up, I don't know, but, um, I do
3995800	4000960	know that we don't know who the voice actors are yet, you may have somebody
4000960	4006640	black that is actually voicing a white character that was done in Final Fantasy
4006640	4014120	14, um, because there was an actress that played Yuri, um, who Yuri was,
4014160	4018080	you know, it's, it's, it's our rod, but fair skin, basically it was in the
4018080	4021440	Stormblood, I remember that because unfortunately the voice actors passed
4021440	4024320	away and I remember talking about that on the show and she passed away.
4024320	4028560	But I remember like that she was a person of color and was playing,
4028600	4031520	you know, uh, Yuri in a Final Fantasy 14.
4031800	4035680	So, but I, at the same time, I'm just, I'm just saying that is
4035680	4037160	something that they might be doing.
4037160	4039000	Ashley's voice actor, Mass Effect.
4039160	4039480	Yeah.
4039520	4039880	Oh yeah.
4039920	4042240	There's, and you know, we've seen, we've seen some of that, but it
4042240	4043800	doesn't really address the issue.
4043800	4046040	I'm just saying it might be something you find out.
4046600	4050760	Helps like earlier, like last week, there was controversy about the anime
4050760	4056040	bleach, the voice actor for Chad Jamison price stepped down and said, I am
4056040	4060320	opening this roll up for people of color to do, you know, it's something
4060320	4062400	that nobody asked him to do it.
4062560	4064320	He just felt it was the right thing to do.
4064480	4066760	And there was a person of color as the new voice of Chad.
4068080	4072120	Black, black Facebook is like half is split down the middle.
4072120	4075040	They're like, no, this is woke propaganda.
4075040	4075840	Stop pandering.
4075960	4078240	The other half, I think this is kind of cool.
4078680	4081960	Me personally, I thought the dub was cool.
4082000	4084080	I didn't know Jamison price was a white dude.
4084080	4085760	I thought he did a great job.
4086120	4088720	I don't think he should have stepped down cause nobody
4088720	4089920	asked him to do a complaint.
4090240	4093720	But if this is what he's doing to open up roles for people of color,
4093720	4096280	to get further into the, into voice acting.
4096880	4101520	So be it, if it sounds good, it sounds good as a voice of
4101520	4103480	Jack is roll with the punches.
4103480	4109400	You know, I will say, if nothing else, Yoshi P has shown at least
4109640	4114720	here's the thing, Yoshi P, not a great look on this, but his track
4114720	4118960	record is pretty good when it comes to being educated by his fan base.
4119000	4121320	And I think you've seen that in final fantasy 14.
4121600	4126120	Um, for example, the same sex marriage, or they call it the bonding
4126120	4129120	ceremonies or whatever they call it in that he listened to the
4129120	4131120	feedback and the team implemented that.
4131360	4136080	Um, when they announced that Viera would be limited to female forms
4136080	4140080	only, and you know, that many voices, including me rose up and said,
4140080	4143120	why not have why I thought you said you weren't doing gender lock
4143120	4143920	characters anymore.
4143920	4145960	Why are you locking characters to certain gender?
4146280	4148640	And they reverse that and they put male VR.
4148640	4150880	I mean, we had to wait an expansion for it, but they put male
4150880	4152320	VR in the game eventually.
4152680	4154040	Um, and there's other things too.
4154040	4157880	And you might remember when all of those issues with, um, end
4157920	4159440	Walker's launch happened.
4159880	4166440	Yoshi P said something I never hear CEO say, and that was, I'm sorry.
4167520	4171920	So, you know, again, there's a lot, a lot can happen in the next few
4171920	4175200	days, you know, Yoshi P has got to take some time to listen to this
4175200	4177320	feedback and think carefully about the response.
4177360	4181840	Although I really think the response needs to come from Matsuda about
4181840	4186920	what they're going to do at square Enix's level to address this.
4186960	4190800	And yes, I know they, I know they have games like four spoken, but
4190800	4194720	that isn't really addressing the problem because final fantasy is
4194720	4198960	a long running franchise with a diversity problem.
4199440	4199920	Right.
4200320	4202960	I will say this before I get up on out of here.
4203280	4206240	You know who Yoshi P needs to talk to about this?
4207920	4213120	Harada from Tekken, two words, Leroy Smith.
4213560	4214080	That's it.
4214680	4219960	People asked Harada on Twitter about this character, and he just went on
4219960	4224080	into this long, interesting diatribe about diversity within the Tekken
4224080	4228960	games and fandom, black Twitter gave him an automatic pass to the cookout.
4231240	4236600	I think there's a lot of developers in Japan right now who might need to listen.
4237120	4237600	Yeah.
4237720	4238200	A lot.
4238200	4243440	That's why a lot of people of color are going to Japan, not just make
4243440	4248040	their goals and dreams come true, but to be heard and be spoken and hoping
4248040	4249920	that they work on a project or whatever.
4250240	4255360	And what happens is they can be a part of it and be more involved when it
4255360	4257600	comes to people like me, you know?
4259400	4264640	Well, I love a new final fantasy game, you know, medieval setting character like me.
4264640	4270080	We need somebody fabulous as you Rob, you know, we need an awesome spitfire
4270080	4274080	like Jamie, you know, and we need an awesome badass like Loki.
4275280	4278080	The Tsunteri is already a thing, so.
4279280	4280280	We are a party of four.
4280280	4283280	I can't call you a Tsunteri, that's an understatement.
4283320	4285240	We are a party of four right now.
4285240	4289440	So quick, which final fantasy class are you in the party right here, right now?
4289440	4290840	We are the warriors of light.
4290840	4291600	Which class are you?
4291600	4292600	Really, Rob?
4292600	4293600	Really?
4294600	4295600	Black Mage.
4295600	4296600	Come on now.
4297600	4299600	It is not just because of that.
4299600	4302600	If you remember, it's not just that.
4302600	4308600	If you remember the webcomic nuclear power 8-bit theater, put us all together.
4308600	4311600	I'll be snarky as that Black Mage.
4311600	4312600	Believe you me.
4312600	4314600	Bard for me.
4315600	4319600	See, I would have to go snarky as that Black Mage.
4319600	4323600	See, I would have to go, since I'm playing through Final Fantasy 5 right now,
4323600	4329600	my most versatile character is Lena, who I have as a Red Mage with X magic.
4330600	4332600	So I cast double spells.
4333600	4334600	It's pretty useful.
4334600	4335600	All right, Loki, you're all that's left.
4335600	4337600	You're going to have to go warrior.
4337600	4339600	We need a tank.
4339600	4341600	We need to be our black belt.
4341600	4342600	No, what do you want to be?
4342600	4343600	You don't have to do it.
4343600	4344600	What do you want to be?
4344600	4348600	I was Red Mage before in 11, so I would do Red Mage again.
4348600	4349600	Okay.
4349600	4350600	There you go.
4350600	4351600	All right.
4351600	4352600	I think like when I'm in 14.
4352600	4354600	Red Mage, Black Mage in 11.
4354600	4357600	I think in 14, I was doing a summoner.
4357600	4359600	So maybe summoner.
4359600	4361600	We're going to be a Bard and three mages.
4361600	4365600	We are going to get our fucking ass kicked by Chaos, but we'll have fun in the process.
4365600	4369600	Red mages have very good defense.
4369600	4370600	That's true.
4370600	4376600	And I'm doing the Final Fantasy 5 version, so I can actually, instead of having double cast,
4376600	4378600	I can do equip shields.
4378600	4379600	There you go.
4379600	4380600	There you go.
4380600	4381600	All right.
4381600	4387600	Rama, thank you for calling in and thank you for putting a shirt on and calling in and
4387600	4388600	giving us your take on this.
4388600	4391600	Really value your insight and so forth.
4391600	4394600	And I invite all of the listeners, if they have something to say on this.
4394600	4396600	I really would love to hear from everybody on this.
4396600	4400600	Participate at orangelandtrady.com is the place to send an email, or you can tweet us,
4400600	4405600	of course, throughout the week at OLR for at least a few more days until Twitter completely
4405600	4406600	collapses.
4406600	4408600	So thank you, Rama.

4419600	4420600	All right.
4420600	4421600	Will do.
4421600	4422600	Awesome.
4422600	4423600	All right.
4423600	4424600	Thanks, Rama.
4424600	4425600	Appreciate you.
4425600	4426600	No problem.
4426600	4427600	You take care, y'all.
4427600	4428600	All right.
4428600	4429600	Bye.
4429600	4430600	Bye.
4430600	4431600	All right.
4431600	4432600	Let's move on to our next story.
4432600	4441600	Well, you know, it was going to happen one day or another, but Lionsgate, which has produced
4441600	4449600	the John Wick franchise, is in talks to do a major video game from it.
4449600	4453600	I mean, there's not much details, but I would reckon it would be some sort of runaround
4453600	4459600	and shoot the bad guy and get revenge for your dog sort of thing.
4460600	4465600	Or it could be like some in-depth like Assassin's Creed style thing, you know, going by like
4465600	4466600	the later movies or something.
4466600	4467600	I don't know.
4467600	4473600	But but at any rate, it's it's in talks.
4473600	4474600	I don't have much more about that.
4474600	4476600	Just it's floating.
4476600	4484600	It needs to be like the TMNT arcade game with full 90s effects still in.
4484600	4485600	Exactly.
4485600	4488600	It's the only way that makes sense for me is just like, you know, you just have constant
4489600	4492600	like streams of bad guys coming in kind of like the movie.
4492600	4494600	Yeah, I play it.
4494600	4496600	Loki, what do you have for us?
4496600	4497600	All right.
4497600	4501600	Well, old things becoming new again.
4501600	4506600	So the Oregon Trail is coming to the switch on November 14th.
4506600	4508600	So that's in like a week here.
4508600	4515600	And yeah, apparently this is a project by Gameloft and Harper Collins.
4515600	4518600	And it looks like kind of a remake, I guess, of the game.
4518600	4520600	I'm not sure if this has been out on other platforms.
4520600	4522600	I assume probably has.
4522600	4528600	But yeah, now they're going to be bringing it to the switch so we can all die of dysentery
4528600	4529600	together.
4529600	4530600	Oh, yeah, of course.
4530600	4531600	Right here.
4531600	4535600	It says it's on Steam and on the Microsoft shop.
4535600	4537600	So I'm assuming Xbox as well.
4537600	4538600	Neat.
4538600	4539600	Yeah.
4539600	4540600	Check that out.
4540600	4542600	Dark to see in chat says, I think it's an Apple arcade port.
4542600	4547600	And yeah, Jason, our voiceover guy kind of referenced that in the intro tonight, too.
4547600	4548600	It seems like it is a cool.
4548600	4551600	Yeah, it's a port of what was on Apple Arcade a little while ago.
4551600	4559600	So yeah, it'll be, you know, it's literally a game that defined a generation.
4559600	4564600	So as long as I can go ham on like, oh, yes, I can on wildlife.
4564600	4565600	That's awesome.
4565600	4566600	Absolutely.
4566600	4567600	I would hope so.
4567600	4569600	All right.
4569600	4576600	Well, going to our next story, let's talk about finally a premiere date for the HBO
4576600	4580600	Last of Us series, which I know a lot of people are looking forward to.
4580600	4582600	January 15th is the day.
4582600	4586600	So you don't always see premieres in January, but that's pretty fun.
4586600	4592600	The Last of Us TV series will be on HBO and HBO Max January 15th at 9 p.m.
4592600	4593600	Eastern.
4593600	4595600	Does that does that conflict with our show?
4595600	4597600	Did they pick a Sunday?
4597600	4599600	They sure did, didn't they?
4599600	4600600	Yes, they did.
4600600	4601600	That is a Sunday.
4601600	4602600	Assholes.
4602600	4603600	All right.
4603600	4607600	Well, you have to tape it or watch it on HBO Max after the fact.
4607600	4612600	Do you love how I still say you got to tape it as if anybody actually uses VHS to record
4612600	4613600	things anyway?
4613600	4615600	Does anyone still use VHS to record shows?
4615600	4620600	But anyway, you got to you got to watch that on demand later because we'll be live.
4620600	4623600	But I guess if you listen to us on the podcast feed, then that works, too.
4623600	4626600	So you got to do one live and do the other later.
4626600	4630600	So there's going to be 10 episodes in the initial season.
4630600	4634600	Of course, you are probably already aware, but The Last of Us has Pedro Pascal starring
4634600	4640600	as Joe and Bella Ramsey from Game of Thrones is starring as Ellie in the game.
4640600	4644600	And there are some other big names in the series, like Nick Offerman, Gabriel Luna,
4644600	4647600	Anna Torv are also in it.
4647600	4651600	Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, voice actors from the game, will also be making appearances
4651600	4652600	in the series.
4653600	4657600	The show is expected to follow the plot of the game.
4657600	4661600	So, you know, not to deviate too much from that, but we'll see.
4661600	4662600	Who knows?
4662600	4668600	Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann does serve as writer and executive producer from Chernobyl.
4668600	4671600	Craig Mazin is also helping out with that.
4671600	4677600	The Last of Us will have creative input from the developer and acclaimed talent behind
4677600	4678600	the cameras.
4678600	4684600	So it's not just like taking an IP and turning it over to people that are familiar with movies.
4684600	4686600	They're working a lot more in tandem.
4686600	4689600	So it'll be very interesting to see what happens with that.
4689600	4690600	Oh, interesting.
4690600	4695600	Rama in chat says, yes, a bunch of fans in Japan broke out their Betamax machines to
4695600	4698600	record the reboot of Urusei Yatsura.
4698600	4700600	I'll send you the link later.
4700600	4701600	Wow.
4702600	4706600	Eshun Hanomat says, does anyone remember the last thing they recorded via VHS?
4706600	4709600	Yes, I do.
4709600	4714600	My parents had a DVD player, but I was in college at the time and I wasn't fancy enough
4714600	4716600	for a DVD player.
4716600	4723600	So I would take the DVDs and I would transfer because our VHS machine had RCA, the red,
4723600	4725600	yellow, white plugs on the front.
4725600	4729600	So you could plug the DVD machine into the VCR and record off the DVD machine.
4729600	4732600	So I recorded DVDs.
4732600	4737600	The last thing I recorded off of VHS was from TV.
4737600	4740600	And it was when we did the Guitar Hero thing.
4740600	4742600	Oh, from the news.
4742600	4743600	Yeah.
4743600	4744600	Yep.
4744600	4748600	I was gonna say the last movie I remember transferring from DVD to VHS like that was
4748600	4754600	Cruel Intentions, which the quintessential 90s film, to be quite honest.
4754600	4757600	I don't remember anything.
4757600	4760600	From that movie or from VHS's?
4760600	4761600	At all.
4761600	4762600	Oh, at all.
4762600	4765600	I don't remember the last three decades.
4765600	4766600	Sorry.
4766600	4767600	That's okay.
4767600	4768600	Let's see.
4768600	4772600	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the last thing I recorded on a VHS was a TV special that
4772600	4774600	I was in early on in my NFL drumline career.
4774600	4778600	There was a special about the lottery halftime show that we were in and they recorded a segment
4778600	4779600	with us.
4779600	4784600	Prince Peach Fuzz says, word of advice, don't watch any VHS tapes with no labels that are
4784600	4786600	found underneath your parents bed.
4786600	4789600	All right.
4789600	4800600	Don't go to a cabin in the resort areas of Japan and play any VHS tape that happens to
4800600	4802600	be still in the VCR when you get there.
4802600	4803600	Yes.
4803600	4806600	I was gonna say if a friend hands you a tape and says you need to watch it within seven
4806600	4808600	days, don't do it.
4808600	4810600	All right.
4810600	4815600	Let's get to our next segment, which obviously we're gonna get into the classic game of the
4815600	4818600	week, but I wanted to say before we do that, and obviously it's a little different this
4818600	4822600	week because once a month Dark Sakura mixes it up, but you might've noticed last week
4822600	4827600	and this week, even though she's here, she's done a prerecorded segment for us because
4827600	4831600	I believe it's a little easier on your voice to do this all in a prerecorded segment and
4831600	4834600	you can make little movies to go with it.
4834600	4841600	We are looking at ways for the podcast folks of putting these movies on social media like
4841600	4843600	YouTube or something like that.
4843600	4846600	I don't know if we'll do YouTube or TikTok, but one of those places where you can then
4846600	4849600	watch these later on if you want throughout the week.
4849600	4850600	So we are looking into that.
4850600	4852600	I hope to have more to announce on that when we get back.
4852600	4854600	So I just wanted to get that out there.
4854600	4858600	But in the meantime, let's get to the segment, shall we?
4868600	4873600	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4873600	4876600	out a classic and tell you about it.
4876600	4880600	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4883600	4889600	Today's classic electronic game is a series of gaming watches released by Nelsonic starting
4889600	4893600	in the late 1970s through the 1990s.
4893600	4900600	Nelsonic, while being known for higher end watches currently, was well known for pop
4900600	4903600	culture themed wrist watches for children and young adults.
4903600	4911600	Their early watches had LCD screens with basic functions like the time, duh, and an alarm
4911600	4912600	clock.
4912600	4918600	The company was inspired by other specialty watches like calculator watches and even cigarette
4918600	4921600	lighter watches to make gaming watches.
4921600	4923600	And so they did.
4923600	4930600	They obtained licenses from Sega, Nintendo, Midway, Milton Bradley, and others for games
4930600	4935600	and even had licenses for standard watches from franchises like Barbie, G.I.
4935600	4942600	Joe, Power Rangers, and Ghostbusters released as the real Ghostbusters to name a few.
4942600	4947600	The company was also a distributor for the Game & Watch series.
4947600	4954600	Among notable games are Simon, the Milton Bradley game, Space Attacker that was for
4954600	4960600	some releases as Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan, The Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, Frogger,
4960600	4966600	several Mario games, Legend of Zelda, Tetris, and a few others.
4966600	4970600	In fact, two of their games were notable firsts.
4970600	4976600	Luigi's Hammer Toss was the first game to feature only Luigi as a playable character,
4976600	4980600	Princess Toadstool's Castle Run was her first as well.
4980600	4985600	Star Fox had two different layout releases and one of them included a headphone jack
4985600	4986600	and headphones.
4986600	4992600	Some of these games were also released in Japan at McDonald's including the Luigi's
4992600	4996600	Hammer Toss and the Princess Toadstool's Castle Run.
4996600	5003600	The last two releases from Nelsonic came out in 1997 with the last actual game being Dinky
5003600	5004600	Dino's Watch.
5004600	5011600	It was a Tamagotchi style digital pet that you could raise and take care of.
5011600	5018600	The other one was a standard licensed watch themed around Poochie, a pink and white canine
5018600	5023600	marketing sensation from the late 80s through the 90s.
5023600	5028600	I had a couple of Poochie dolls, I will admit to it.
5028600	5032600	These days, the watches can actually fetch.
5032600	5038600	Right now on eBay, they're ranging anywhere from about $45 to well over $500, close to
5038600	5042600	$600 in and out of its packaging.
5042600	5049600	One of them is a working mint-in-box Legend of Zelda, which is presently up to about $300.
5049600	5055600	And then the most expensive one that I saw was a U.S. Princess Toadstool's Castle Run
5055600	5058600	still in its packaging.
5058600	5062600	So, a few of my friends had these.
5062600	5068600	I did not, because honestly I couldn't stand wearing a watch.
5068600	5077600	But my friends would play these in class, try to sneak with getting the game in.
5077600	5082600	Of course, my other friends were busy programming their graphing calculators to play a whole
5082600	5084600	position, for example.
5084600	5085600	But I digress.
5085600	5090600	These were pretty much everywhere, all the cool kids at them.
5090600	5096600	And I mean, I don't recall them being supremely expensive when they came out.
5096600	5100600	They were very novel sort of things.
5100600	5108600	And definitely just looking at them evokes this nostalgia for me, so I'm here for it.
5108600	5115600	If any of you still have a working one, I would love to know in our mailbox at participate
5115600	5118600	at orangeloundradio.com.
5118600	5125600	At any rate, this was the Classic Electronic Game, or Pentultimate Entry.
5125600	5131600	Stay tuned for next month's Ultimate Entry.
5131600	5133600	Alright, there it is.
5133600	5135600	The Classic Electronic Handheld of the Month.
5135600	5137600	I was never cool enough to have one of those, sadly.
5137600	5138600	I remember them, though.
5138600	5140600	My friend had that Tetris one.
5140600	5143600	But yeah, they were pretty cool.
5143600	5149600	Looking in some of the comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vlog network, Robot Giggles,
5149600	5152600	first time chatter, hi, welcome to OLR, says, I want one.
5152600	5155600	Yeah, that would be a fun retro thing to collect.
5155600	5157600	Even just those special boxes.
5157600	5159600	In the video, you kind of show the boxes.
5159600	5161600	They are so expensive.
5161600	5162600	I know, I know.
5162600	5170600	Like, even one of those Luigi watches out of the package was like 200 bones.
5170600	5171600	Yeah.
5171600	5172600	Yes.
5172600	5175600	You'll have to, the only way you're going to find one is to get like a garage sale or
5175600	5178600	someplace that doesn't know the value of what those things are really worth, which, you
5178600	5182600	know, is, you know, shady, but it is what it is.
5182600	5186600	Didi Archaholic, Hello Hello says, I have never seen or heard of these watches before.
5186600	5188600	That must have come out long after I was in school.
5188600	5189600	When were these popular?
5189600	5191600	I remember them when I was in school.
5191600	5192600	Yeah.
5192600	5193600	Oh.
5193600	5194600	Yeah.
5194600	5195600	Yeah.
5195600	5196600	All right.
5196600	5197600	Great pick.
5197600	5200600	S2100 Matt says, I think I had a Double Dragon one, but that was Tiger Electronics.
5200600	5202600	Well, I'm sure once, you know.
5202600	5203600	These weren't Tiger.
5203600	5204600	Yeah.
5204600	5208600	Once, you know, these are out, then the other gaming franchises want to have their versions
5208600	5210600	of that and all that good stuff.
5210600	5214600	So I'm sure there were plenty of, I would say knockoffs, but clones we'll say.
5214600	5219600	I'm not even going to say either of that because graphing, not graphing, but calculator watches
5219600	5221600	have been around since the seventies.
5221600	5228600	And even before that, they had like, like I was showing the pocket watch, a lighter
5228600	5234600	and actually even today they have watches that have, that are USB charged that have
5234600	5236600	a lighter built into them.
5236600	5245600	You know, the, the concept of putting things in a watch and carrying it with you is, is
5245600	5247600	not a really new concept.
5247600	5251600	I mean, hello, I've got my, my Apple watch on.
5251600	5255600	Never thought I would want a smartwatch until I used one.
5255600	5258600	And then I was like, Oh, this is for me, game changing.
5258600	5261600	Like just the whole like workout heart rate measuring.
5261600	5263600	And now the, now I get, now I get.
5263600	5264600	Call detection.
5264600	5265600	Too damn loud.
5265600	5266600	Yeah.
5266600	5267600	All this stuff.
5267600	5268600	I'm just like, I love it.
5268600	5273600	So, and of course the necessary pictures of my kitties that I can look at all the time
5273600	5275600	on the background.
5275600	5276600	So there's that too.
5276600	5279600	I just use the modular ones that I don't forget when crap is.
5279600	5285600	And I know how hot it is, which is not a Prince Peach fuzz is asking doom on a watch.
5285600	5286600	Not yet.
5286600	5287600	Not yet.
5287600	5288600	But you probably do it though.
5288600	5289600	Yeah, probably.
5289600	5290600	I'm sure it's possible.
5290600	5291600	Oh, come on.
5291600	5299600	I, I, on one of like an old, like black and white Mac, I had four disc doom installed
5299600	5301600	on one of those in the lab at school.
5301600	5303600	So I could play it instead of paying attention.
5303600	5304600	I love that.
5304600	5305600	All right.
5305600	5308600	So let's travel around the industry and check out some other headlines in a segment.
5308600	5310600	We call rapid fire news.
5310600	5312600	Uh, let's start with Loki.
5312600	5313600	Yep.
5313600	5319600	So there's, um, a little bit more of an announcement from EA talking about their partnership with,
5319600	5322600	um, Marvel.
5322600	5326600	So they're going to be doing some Marvel games, including there's, I think three in the works
5326600	5327600	right now.
5327600	5330600	Uh, one of these is going to be an Ironman game.
5330600	5336600	Um, um, they're saying that, you know, the other ones right now, we don't really know
5336600	5338600	what those are going to be yet.
5338600	5344600	Um, and this is outside of the, you know, midnight suns game that's coming up from fire
5344600	5345600	access.
5345600	5349600	And then that captain America, black Panther game, uh, that was supposed to be, I think
5349600	5350600	coming out as well.
5350600	5353600	I don't remember which studio is working on that.
5353600	5358600	Um, so yeah, there was also supposed to be another black Panther game, I think at EA
5358600	5359600	as well.
5359600	5367600	So I guess we'll find out, you know, maybe game awards, maybe next E3.
5367600	5370600	I don't know.
5370600	5374600	Um, anyways, this is, uh, interesting, I guess.
5374600	5378600	Um, so you know, that whole Gran Turismo movie that's supposed to be coming out.
5378600	5383600	Well, apparently now, uh, Jerry Holloway Horner is joining the cast as well.
5383600	5388600	So do you mean the ginger spice ginger spice?
5388600	5391600	This is going to be the Gran Turismo movie.
5391600	5393600	By the way, is everyone ready to feel old?
5393600	5395600	Is everyone ready to feel old?
5395600	5399600	Spice World just had its 25th anniversary album released.
5399600	5401600	Spice World is 25 years old.
5401600	5402600	That's their second album.
5402600	5403600	Right?
5403600	5404600	What?
5404600	5407600	I feel old every time I get out of bed.
5407600	5408600	Yeah.
5408600	5410600	My body reminds me I'm old every day.
5410600	5411600	Okay.
5411600	5412600	Tangent time.
5412600	5414600	Choo choo trains pulled up to the station.
5414600	5415600	Here we go.
5415600	5416600	Tangent train.
5416600	5419600	Let's talk about feeling old for a minute.
5419600	5427600	Yesterday, I went, um, into San Francisco to see the touring production of Jagged Little Pill, which was on Broadway a few years ago.
5427600	5432600	I think it was, uh, I want to say Grammy nominated, Tony nominated or whatever they call those awards.
5432600	5443600	So long story short, I had went out to Broadway, New York City in 2019 before the pandemic to see, uh, Jagged Little Pill on Broadway.
5443600	5448600	Um, and I went with my friend, Melanie, um, one of the Mel's.
5448600	5452600	Uh, so we went out in Broadway and we saw the show there.
5452600	5459600	Three years later, almost to the day yesterday, we went and saw it in San Francisco together again.
5459600	5461600	So we got to see the show three years apart.
5461600	5464600	And there were actually things I liked about the touring production better.
5464600	5467600	One of them was the seats, but that's, that's neither here nor there.
5467600	5475600	Um, my point is we decided it would be cute to get pictures in front of the marquee three years apart.
5475600	5480600	Hilariously, because it was fucking cold in New York, I was wearing the, uh, a hoodie.
5480600	5485600	And because it was cold in San Francisco yesterday and rainy, I was wearing the exact same hoodie.
5485600	5488600	In fact, it's this it's actually behind me here.
5488600	5490600	Oh shit, it's way over there on the couch.
5490600	5494600	I can't grab it easily, but it's, it's an Atari hoodie that I had imported.
5494600	5501600	Anybody that's seen a selfie, I love that fucking hoodie because it has like the actual like wood grain on it.
5501600	5503600	Um, it's, it's a beautiful hoodie.
5503600	5506600	I'll grab it when somebody else is doing a show, a story and put it on cam.
5506600	5511600	But, um, my point with all that is I could see two things.
5511600	5514600	One, I could see the weight loss in my face.
5514600	5520600	You know, I don't always notice that in selfies of me, but I was like, Oh fuck, my face is like a lot thinner than it was three years ago.
5520600	5521600	But number two.
5521600	5522600	Happens.
5522600	5531600	And number two, to the point of this whole tangent train, there is so much more gray in my beard now than there was three years ago.
5531600	5536600	It has been a long pandemic.
5536600	5537600	You know what I found?
5537600	5538600	What?
5538600	5541600	The picture when you took me to the hospital for my surgery.
5541600	5544600	Oh my gosh.
5544600	5549600	Yeah, we, we, we look a bit different now.
5549600	5551600	Yeah, absolutely.
5551600	5552600	All right.
5552600	5556600	That's just, that's just really, really fun.
5556600	5557600	Yeah.
5557600	5561600	This is interesting to see like a very similar picture, even if it's in like two very different towns.
5561600	5565600	It's very similar to see that, um, like three years apart.
5565600	5569600	Uh, I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
5569600	5576600	Uh, when I brought up spice spice world, uh, Jessiks and chat says, I'm ashamed to say I saw the spice girls movie in the theater.
5576600	5577600	Don't be ashamed.
5577600	5578600	Don't be ashamed.
5578600	5580600	I had the best time.
5580600	5582600	That movie came out when I was in college.
5582600	5585600	So I can't even say I was a kid and I made my parents take me.
5585600	5586600	That movie came out when I was in college.
5586600	5589600	It's one of those movies that's like so cheesy, bad.
5589600	5590600	It's kind of good.
5590600	5592600	It has meatloaf in it.
5592600	5593600	It does have meatloaf in it.
5593600	5594600	It has Richard O'Brien in it.
5594600	5600600	It has that scene where they, they have the bus jumping and they, they do the, anyway.
5600600	5601600	Wasn't Rowan Atkinson in it?
5601600	5605600	I think all the, and, um, absolutely fabulous.
5605600	5606600	Had a cameo too.
5606600	5609600	Like all the big British pop culture stuff was in it and you know, and it's, it's, it's,
5609600	5612600	it's the spice world movie is still quotable.
5612600	5613600	What should I wear?
5613600	5619600	The little Gucci dress, the little Gucci dress or the little Gucci dress.
5619600	5624600	Anyway, I promise never to quote that movie again on this show.
5624600	5625600	No, I'm going to break that promise.
5625600	5626600	We all know it.
5626600	5627600	All right.
5627600	5629600	Uh, moving on what we had more rapid fire.
5629600	5637600	So like for spice girls stuff though, I still use, I use the story of the, the, uh, union
5637600	5638600	flag dress.
5639600	5641600	For me, customizing my own clothes.
5641600	5646600	I was like, if ginger spice can do it with the tea towel and a dress, I can do it.
5647600	5651600	I wanted to see that dress so bad when I was at the hard rock in Vegas before they bulldozed
5651600	5652600	it.
5652600	5653600	It's gone now.
5653600	5659600	Um, because I'd seen it there in the year, in the year 2000, literally the first, the
5659600	5661600	same trip where I was, I played dance, dance revolution for the first time.
5661600	5665600	I saw that dress and I tried to go find it when we were there a few years ago.
5665600	5667600	Again, another melody story.
5667600	5668600	Um, couldn't find it.
5668600	5669600	They moved it.
5669600	5670600	It was gone.
5670600	5672600	And now they've bulldozed the whole damn hotel.
5672600	5675600	So I don't know where that dress is now, but I want to go see it again.
5677600	5678600	It's like, it's like a movie.
5678600	5679600	I want to go see that dress again.
5680600	5681600	It is.
5681600	5682600	It's yeah.
5682600	5683600	It's a thing.
5683600	5684600	I have one last anecdote.
5685600	5686600	Yes, please.
5686600	5689600	Dan sent me a trailer for a Broadway show.
5689600	5694600	That's back to the future of the musical is playing at the winter garden theater.
5694600	5695600	Oh, is that what they're replacing?
5695600	5696600	Beetlejuice with?
5696600	5697600	It must be.
5697600	5698600	Cause I think Beetlejuice is in winter garden right now.
5699600	5702600	And the thing is, is that I really want to see it because the one and only time I've
5702600	5704600	been to a Broadway show was in the winter garden theater.
5704600	5706600	And I saw cats, cats.
5707600	5711600	Did you not hear me sing along with the entire, I know you sang along the entire, you defended
5711600	5713600	that movie when no one else would.
5713600	5714600	And I still love it.
5714600	5715600	I know.
5715600	5720600	I know you, uh, uh, uh, winter garden was where a mamma mia played for a long time too.
5720600	5721600	And Rocky.
5721600	5722600	Yeah.
5722600	5723600	So, yeah.
5723600	5726600	But, but, but I think cats was like its longest running.
5726600	5727600	Oh, I'm sure.
5727600	5728600	Show.
5728600	5730600	I think it was like 19 years.
5730600	5731600	Yeah.
5731600	5732600	Yeah.
5732600	5733600	Yeah.
5733600	5734600	I was looking about going back to Broadway and seeing some stuff, but there's not, there's
5734600	5736600	not a lot of shows where I'm like, Ooh, I have to see that.
5736600	5740600	I still feel like Broadway is still trying to recover from everything that happened.
5740600	5743600	It's going to take a few more months for them to get their group back.
5743600	5747600	So, um, I mean, I'm not going to pay to see Lea Michele and funny girl.
5747600	5748600	I'm not.
5748600	5752600	Whenever there's a cat's revival, I definitely want to go, but I'm, you know,
5752600	5757600	when I went like Tommy was playing and I could have seen that, but I picked cats.
5757600	5758600	All right.
5758600	5760600	Anyway, we should probably go back to video games.
5760600	5761600	What do you have for us?
5761600	5769600	Um, well, uh, the Pokemon developer creatures is hiring for work.
5769600	5774600	Um, and indeed what they're hiring for is for next generation hardware.
5774600	5780600	The listing actually says research and development for other next generation hardware is listed
5781600	5784600	as this role's workflow.
5784600	5790600	Um, meaning that they may be planning a project to show up on a future platform.
5790600	5795600	Um, there, the job position is actually for a 3D CG character modeler.
5795600	5800600	So, I mean, Hey, also if anyone wants a job, go apply, I guess.
5800600	5809600	Um, but yeah, uh, and since they've, you know, been working on a Pokemon like that,
5809600	5810600	it stands to reason.
5810600	5814600	It could be another one, especially since the switches had like five of five mainline
5814600	5815600	Pokemon games.
5815600	5819600	And a new, a new one's going to be out right around the time.
5819600	5822600	Our next show is, I think, in fact, I think gen nine will be out by the time we have our
5822600	5823600	next episode.
5823600	5825600	So I'm really excited about that.
5825600	5832600	I mean, they've been involved with Pokemon since the, the get go, but they only started
5832600	5838600	working with game freak, like ones that went to 3D in 2013.
5838600	5841600	So it'd be interesting to see what happens.
5841600	5845600	I'm being corrected on my Broadway, uh, by Rama, who says that Beetlejuice is at the
5845600	5846600	marquee theater.
5846600	5849600	The music man is currently playing at the winter garden.
5849600	5852600	That must be the revival that had Hugh Jackman at one point.
5852600	5855600	I don't think he's in it anymore, but anyway, thank you for the update.
5855600	5858600	That's going to be gone in a few months.
5858600	5859600	Yeah.
5859600	5860600	All right.
5860600	5862600	Let's, uh, get one more story here.
5862600	5864600	Oh, this is about Mega Man 11.
5864600	5865600	That's right.
5865600	5866600	I want to talk about this release because this is interesting.
5866600	5869600	Mega Man 11 has now, Oh, he is still in it.
5869600	5870600	Oh, I didn't know that.
5870600	5871600	Okay.
5871600	5875600	Anyway, uh, we'll, we'll have to do a Broadway spinoff show as a different show.
5875600	5880600	At some point, we still owe the listeners a foodie Oh show, by the way, it's been, it's
5880600	5882600	literally been a year, but that was my fault.
5882600	5884600	Uh, take full confession for that.
5884600	5885600	Anyway.
5885600	5892600	Um, Mega Man 11, 1.6 million in sales, uh, with the recent Capcom data with that, uh,
5892600	5897600	it actually now is the best selling Mega Man game in the franchise.
5897600	5899600	Uh, that is coming again from Capcom.
5899600	5902600	Uh, they updated the sales figures on their site.
5902600	5908600	Uh, and this means that Mega Man 11 is number 67 overall with 1.6 million in sales.
5908600	5915600	Uh, Mega Man 2 used to be the best selling in the franchise, 1.51 million in sales.
5915600	5919600	Of course, this has a lot of people asking, all right, Mega Man 12, when?
5919600	5922600	No comment yet from Capcom, but I will remind everyone.
5922600	5923600	The game awards is coming.
5923600	5928600	Don't set the bar too high, but you know, if there was a good time to announce Mega
5928600	5931600	Man 12, I think that would certainly be the time.
5931600	5935600	So, all right, let's move on.
5935600	5939600	Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that
5939600	5942600	are, uh, coming out soon in a country near you.
5942600	5946600	And this is, this is now the time where it's going to start to amp up, right?
5947600	5948600	Nope.
5948600	5949600	Not this week?
5949600	5950600	Really?
5950600	5951600	I would have thought we're in November now.
5951600	5952600	Come on.
5952600	5954600	We're, we're in the, we're in the fifth quarter now.
5954600	5956600	So it's, it's not a lot.
5956600	5958600	No, actually there are things coming out.
5958600	5965600	So we have a game called a little to the left that's on PC and Mac, uh, football manager
5965600	5974600	2023 on PC, Mac, and into the switch PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series, iOS, and Android.

5981600	5985600	four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
5985600	5989600	We have God of war Ragnarok on PlayStation four and PlayStation five.
5989600	5991600	Uh, let's see.
5991600	5997600	Hakonewa, um, Bokujo, Kitsuju, um, Muru or Mura.
5997600	5998600	I'm sorry.
5998600	5999600	Mispronounced the last part.
5999600	6002600	Um, that is on Nintendo switch.
6002600	6004600	Aichu, kazoo tight.
6004600	6006600	That's on a Nintendo switch.
6006600	6012600	I added that subtitle, obviously, uh, police simulator patrol officers on PlayStation four,
6012600	6019600	PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series, tactics over reborn on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation
6019600	6025600	four, PlayStation five Valkyrie Elysium on PC.
6025600	6027600	And I believe that's it for the week.
6029600	6037600	Rob, you are muted, Rob.
6037600	6038600	I'm very sorry about that.
6038600	6039600	Wow.
6039600	6040600	I made a booboo.
6040600	6041600	Uh, okay.
6041600	6043600	So let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases there.
6043600	6048600	And, uh, we'll start with, uh, Sonic frontiers on the Nintendo switch is coming out.
6048600	6053600	Uh, it says it is an English version, so I don't think they're, um, uh, uh, making a
6053600	6056600	Japanese dub for that, but that will be released on the switch on November 8th.
6056600	6058600	Um, so that is coming out.

6083600	6086600	ogre reborn is also being released to Japan.
6086600	6087600	Again, that one is not being localized.
6087600	6090600	It's just an English release, but it is being released in Japan.
6090600	6095600	And for those that collect amiibo, there are some Splatoon related amiibo coming out in
6095600	6096600	Japan this week.
6096600	6097600	So check that out.
6097600	6103600	Uh, meanwhile, traveling over to the PlayStation five this week in Japan, Sonic frontiers is
6103600	6105600	also on the PlayStation five this week.
6105600	6110600	God of war Ragnarok also releases on in Japan the same day as the U S and, and assumably
6110600	6111600	everywhere else in the world.
6111600	6115600	Um, there is a special dual sense wireless controller that goes with that, that they
6115600	6116600	are releasing in Japan.
6116600	6119600	I think that controller is actually coming out everywhere, but there's also a PlayStation
6119600	6122600	five bundle, regular and limited edition.
6122600	6126600	Um, I'm not sure what makes it special besides the fact it comes with the game.
6126600	6130600	Cause it doesn't seem to have even the branded controller with it, but, um, cool.
6130600	6132600	I guess maybe if you want that anyway.
6132600	6133600	Cool.
6133600	6138600	Uh, and then lastly, WRC generations is also released on the PlayStation five in Japan
6138600	6139600	this week.
6139600	6142600	One more Mount and blade to banner Lord.
6142600	6144600	It sounds pretty cool.
6144600	6145600	How about Europe?
6145600	6146600	Dark Sakura.
6146600	6152600	Um, in Europe, we have, uh, uh, this batch is on the eighth.
6152600	6160600	We have Sonic frontiers for the big three, four, uh, looks like for a PC, we have football
6160600	6161600	manager 2023.
6161600	6164600	Of course it's real football and not American football.
6164600	6168600	Uh, PlayStation on the eighth also is stray.
6168600	6174600	Uh, for switch, we have see who, um, for the three, we have Cobra Kai two dojos, which
6174600	6176600	is like two dojos rising.
6176600	6177600	Um, on the ninth.
6177600	6184600	Now we have God of war, rock and rock on PlayStation, uh, on the 10th for PlayStation and switch.
6184600	6187600	We have horse tales, Emerald ranch valley.
6187600	6194600	Uh, I, I think I was watching, I think it's already out over here as I was watching, uh,
6194600	6195600	Holly play it.
6195600	6196600	It's me, Holly.
6197600	6204600	Um, also in the 10th, we have asterix nublisk, uh, very, uh, uh, British institution there
6204600	6205600	on the big three.
6205600	6210600	Also for the same, we have Garfield lasagna party, leave out Garfield.
6210600	6212600	I just want the lasagna party.
6212600	6213600	Okay.
6213600	6216600	Um, and then we also have dark D A R Q.
6216600	6221600	Um, on the 11th, we have tactics, ogre reborn for PlayStation and switch for switch.
6221600	6222600	We have ooblets.
6222600	6227600	Um, for the 11th, we have yum, yum cook star.
6227600	6232600	And then finally on the 12th, we have Atari 50, the anniversary celebration.
6232600	6236600	Um, did I'm adding this tactics ogre that's on the 11th.
6236600	6237600	Yeah.
6237600	6241600	Um, it just looks like there's like a whole bunch of like revival series.
6241600	6251600	Is it just me or like there is a Siberia, uh, game coming out and, uh, like, uh,
6251600	6255600	like just gun grave, you know, all coming up.
6255600	6256600	It's so interesting.
6256600	6260600	I think, um, Bobby had mentioned on his show at some point, it makes a lot of sense that,
6260600	6263600	you know, we're seeing a lot of games right now that are kind of things that were developed
6263600	6267600	during COVID and the, you know, the pandemic and all that, and that doing remasters and
6267600	6272600	things like that are a little easier to do, um, uh, remote working and that whole setup
6272600	6274600	than maybe doing a new game.
6274600	6280600	So you're probably seeing a lot of the fruits of that and just what has happened with pandemic.
6280600	6286600	And plus I think the market's kind of shown that those games, people will buy them.
6286600	6289600	You know, there's a lot of us that love to revisit the classic games, but there's a lot
6289600	6292600	of people very thrilled about sweet code and one and two getting remastered and so on.
6292600	6295600	There's lots of remasters that happens as part of the industry.
6295600	6300600	We get more excited about reboots in the video game space than we do in the movie space.
6300600	6302600	That's for sure.
6302600	6304600	And what good reason.
6304600	6305600	All right.
6305600	6310600	Well, if that is it for release dates, then we will move on and get a few more news stories
6310600	6314600	for you before we open up the phones to any more callers that want to call in time.
6314600	6317600	We already heard from Rama earlier in the show, but we're certainly willing to hear
6317600	6318600	from some more people.
6318600	6323600	Just head on over to our discord server, vog network.com slash discord, which by the way,
6323600	6325600	it had some upgrades behind the scenes this week.
6325600	6327600	We're now an official community server.
6327600	6331600	Uh, so we just have a few extra features, nothing too, too fancy.
6331600	6333600	Uh, but we did reorganize some rooms and things like that.
6333600	6339600	So that way, all the notifications for when, uh, we're live or hosts affiliated with a
6339600	6342600	network or live, things like that, they all moved into a different channel.
6342600	6346600	So, um, you can, uh, you can, you know, see all that.
6346600	6349600	So, and I do want to acknowledge, I see the hype train going in chat.
6349600	6354600	I usually don't, uh, read all the donators as we go because we are taping for the podcast.
6354600	6357600	So it's a little hard to do that Twitch thing that a lot of people do where you kind of
6357600	6358600	interrupt what you're doing to thank everyone.
6358600	6359600	But I just want to call out.
6359600	6360600	I see that.
6360600	6361600	Thank you.
6361600	6364600	You all don't have to do that, but you are, and I'm just very appreciative.
6364600	6365600	Thank you for that.
6365600	6368600	Um, so let's move on with a few more news stories.
6368600	6369600	Loki.
6369600	6370600	Yeah.
6370600	6375600	You thought you could go a week without Activision ruining your day with news of maltreatment
6375600	6380600	of their employees, but here we are another week where they're still not treating their
6380600	6381600	employees right.
6381600	6388600	So, um, there was a report from the, uh, union of QA testers.
6388600	6394600	Uh, so that's the game workers Alliance, uh, talking about their ongoing negotiations
6394600	6395600	with Activision.
6395600	6403600	Um, so they've had meetings now talking about, apparently this was the fourth contract bargaining
6403600	6404600	session.
6404600	6406600	Um, it didn't go anywhere.
6406600	6411600	They refused Activision refused to basically meet any of their demands.
6411600	6418600	Um, they wouldn't change their hours or, um, out they said, or outsource the unionized
6418600	6424600	jobs in the future, um, or not assurances that they wouldn't change hours or outsource
6424600	6425600	those jobs.
6425600	6433600	Um, they also refuse to guarantee, um, require or basically include protections for employees
6433600	6440600	require reproductive healthcare and services because of, you know, Roe V Wade being overturned.
6440600	6446600	And also the immediate 10% pay increase for QA testers.
6446600	6451600	And on top of all that, they refuse to compensate them for time during negotiations, which I
6451600	6457600	believe my understanding is required by law that they have to pay them for negotiation
6457600	6459600	meeting time as well.
6459600	6465600	Um, because they're still on the clock, but you know, Activision, the Activision, and
6465600	6469600	they're just going to, they're going to wait until someone punishes them for that.
6469600	6472600	Cost of doing business, I guess.
6472600	6475600	When in the fuck is Kotick going to be out of there?
6475600	6479600	Like, I can't like counting down the days, counting down the day.
6479600	6483600	Well, it's just, I mean, you know, there's, there's new people coming in and they have
6483600	6484600	the same mentality though.
6484600	6490600	Like we talked about, was it that Lulu Chang at MERT, um, Missouri or whatever, who was
6490600	6494600	like, you know, trolling people on Twitter or something like that.
6494600	6496600	Like, I don't know.
6496600	6497600	Yeah.
6497600	6500600	And then, you know, I guess we haven't talked about it yet on the show, but then you have
6500600	6502600	everything that's going on at Twitter.
6502600	6504600	Let's talk about the place where all this stuff comes out.
6504600	6505600	Twitter.
6505600	6509600	I did have to repost that with a big fuck you to Activision.
6509600	6512600	What a disaster Twitter is turning into quickly.
6512600	6517600	And I'm telling you one day, one day in the very new feature, we're going to try to go
6517600	6520600	to that website and it is not going to work.
6520600	6523600	And the staff will be gone that could have brought it back.
6523600	6527600	So you all remember the fail whale from 15 years ago.
6527600	6529600	It's going to be back.
6529600	6533600	So I just, yeah, I know there's a lot of people looking for alternative sites right now.
6533600	6535600	I don't, I don't know what it is.
6535600	6538600	Uh, you know, there's a lot of options that are out there.
6538600	6541600	Some people are talking about, I don't know, Mastodon.
6541600	6543600	There's things I like.
6543600	6545600	I'm not going to Mastodon, it's a mess.
6545600	6546600	There's things I like about it.
6546600	6548600	There's things I don't like about it.
6548600	6551600	I think some of the terminology they've used over there is a disaster.
6551600	6555600	I understand in principle how it's built and the advantages of that.
6555600	6560600	I think the way they're marketing it is really terrible, but something like that,
6560600	6564600	that's open source is not meant to be marketed.
6564600	6566600	So I, I don't know.
6566600	6567600	I don't know how to fix that.
6567600	6570600	Um, I like co-host a lot.
6570600	6573600	I like what they're doing, but co-host has that line to get in now.
6573600	6576600	And also co-host feels really rough around the edges.
6576600	6579600	Like it just, it needs to grow, grow a little more.
6579600	6582600	I know a lot of people are turning to Discord, um, to fill that in.
6582600	6584600	Discord's a little different from Twitter to me.
6584600	6585600	I don't know.
6585600	6589600	And there's people that are going to say, I'm sticking with Twitter till the bitter end.
6589600	6592600	Um, and you know, y'all do what you have to do.
6592600	6594600	I've made my stance pretty clear.
6594600	6596600	If the orange one gets unbanned, I'm leaving Twitter.
6596600	6603600	Um, and I don't, I don't, I've, I've worked very hard over 15 years to build up a following on Twitter.
6603600	6605600	And that is very hard to do.
6605600	6606600	I don't want to be associated with that.
6606600	6608600	And no, I'm not just going to mute them.
6608600	6611600	I don't want to be associated with that platform anymore if that happens.
6611600	6613600	So it's, it's quite that simple.
6613600	6614600	I can do whatever I want.
6614600	6615600	So can you.
6615600	6620600	So, um, that, that, and that's, that's what I'm telling you will happen.
6620600	6623600	Uh, Bobby Blackwell for the good point, download your archive.
6623600	6625600	Uh, that's a good suggestion.
6625600	6629600	I did, when I deactivated Facebook for a little while, I downloaded my archive before I did that.
6629600	6631600	I think that's a very smart call to download your archive.
6631600	6634600	And don't just download your archive if you're planning on leaving.
6635600	6642600	Download your archive, end of sentence, because again, there's going to come a day when you go to twitter.com and it's not going to work.
6645600	6650600	I'm, I can, I, I, I, I would be very confident.
6650600	6657600	Somebody's going to try to fuck with Twitter on the outside, meaning like a DDoS or something to take it down.
6657600	6659600	Um, it's really only a matter of time.
6659600	6662600	So just a suggestion.
6662600	6666600	Anyway, let's talk about Twitter blue thing also.
6666600	6670600	It's just, it's unnecessary.
6670600	6674600	Like I, I would have something that worked.
6674600	6675600	Yeah.
6675600	6680600	Well, and now that there's a shenanigans at the layoffs and then calling to ask people to come back because they're fucking up.
6680600	6681600	Yeah, no, that's all.
6681600	6682600	That's a whole mess.
6682600	6686600	The layoffs in general were highly illegal.
6686600	6690600	I'm just, uh, I have so much like irritation right now.
6691600	6699600	As the show and her mat says just before the start of the show tonight, Kathy Griffin got perma suspended from Twitter for impersonating Lex Luther.
6699600	6701600	So yeah, everybody's doing that.
6701600	6704600	It's the, it's the new, the new meme, I guess.
6704600	6705600	Yeah.
6705600	6711600	Well, the, the, the self-proclaimed meme Lord apparently said, let the comedy begin or something like that.
6711600	6715600	Cause you know, that's what intelligent CEOs do when they take over a multi-billion dollar company.
6716600	6722600	And now also just tweeted today, people that impersonate accounts that don't label themselves a parody account will be permanently suspended.
6722600	6724600	Well, where did the comedy show go, buddy?
6725600	6726600	Oh, right.
6726600	6727600	He can't take a joke.
6727600	6728600	Obviously.
6728600	6731600	It's just the whole thing is just reused.
6731600	6741600	But anyway, but you know what, in a way, here's the light at the end of the tunnel where Kathy Griffin goes, not just her it's, it's, you know, cause I know she's a very polarizing people.
6741600	6750600	I'm going to say wherever Lady Gaga goes, wherever Oprah goes, that will be the new social network.
6752600	6753600	But I don't know if they go anywhere.
6753600	6754600	You know what?
6754600	6758600	The world existed and the world turned without Twitter.
6758600	6761600	You survived without Twitter.
6761600	6764600	Everything will be okay without Twitter.
6764600	6766600	It sucks, but it'll be okay.
6766600	6768600	I can't get it in my settings.
6768600	6770600	Like my settings link is gone.
6771600	6772600	Oh, weird.
6774600	6775600	Anyway.
6775600	6776600	All right.
6776600	6777600	Let's move on.
6777600	6778600	We have more stories to talk about.
6778600	6780600	Actually, I think the next one is yours, Dark Soccer.
6781600	6782600	Yeah.
6782600	6807600	So, there is a big legal requirement now that for any video game company in New York City with over four employees, it has to give a good faith salary range in its job listings.
6808600	6815600	That includes companies like Take Two, Rockstar, a few other games.
6816600	6824600	I mean, the industry doesn't have like the biggest footprint in the city, but I think it's a very good thing.
6824600	6833600	I think every company should do this is that everyone should, every company should be listing their pay ranges when they put up a job listing.
6833600	6838600	Epic is among them.
6838600	6840600	Twitch is having to do it.
6840600	6849600	Activision is listing a measurement lead role with the salary putting on it.
6849600	6860600	But basically, the majority of companies are not going to list how much they're going to offer to pay.
6860600	6863600	And I think that this is a very good thing.
6863600	6874600	In fact, the same sort of law is going to be going into effect in California and Washington State where an employer has to list pay ranges.
6874600	6882600	This is a big departure as well from the days where they're like, oh, well, here's what you make and don't tell anybody.
6882600	6888600	I'm like, tell everybody what you make and make sure that you are being paid.
6888600	6895600	If you're being paid less than one of your coworkers, you go to HR and you ask them why.
6895600	6911600	If your base pay is lower, especially women, people of color, non-binary, anyone who is not the quote default white cisgender straight man.
6911600	6915600	Definitely talk about your salary.
6916600	6918600	I think this is a good thing.
6918600	6922600	This is affecting all jobs listed in New York City.
6922600	6927600	Yes, but obviously this is impacting the game industry, which we follow here.
6927600	6932600	But also, I do notice that laws like this, because they were talking about doing something like this in California.
6932600	6934600	I don't remember if they actually did it or not.
6934600	6936600	No, the legislation is going through.
6936600	6937600	That's what I said.
6937600	6938600	Got it.
6938600	6949600	Also giving a tip that Glassdoor tends to have a lot of salary ranges because people will post them on Glassdoor and say what they make when they can have a little anonymity to it.
6949600	6954600	I know a lot of people use that website when they're researching places to work and things like that.
6954600	6957600	All right, moving on.
6957600	6961600	Speaking of Twitter antics and what they've led to, right, Loki?
6962600	6978600	Yeah, so they've led to some, well, people obviously leave Twitter, including Nabilian or Nibel, who has been a popular news source in the gaming industry for quite a while.
6978600	6983600	Aren't they one that posts insider leaks and stuff like that as well?
6983600	6985600	I'm not really sure.
6985600	6986600	Admit it.
6986600	6987600	I never followed them.
6987600	6992600	I recognize the icon, but I didn't follow them personally.
6992600	6997600	I also don't follow Wario64, but how can you not miss what that person posts?
6997600	7000600	It's everywhere whenever they post something.
7000600	7006600	When that person leaves Twitter, that's pretty big.
7006600	7007600	Yeah.
7007600	7012600	Basically, they're moving to Patreon.
7012600	7016600	Today, I will move on from both Twitter and Patreon.
7016600	7020600	There won't be any games coverage from me on either platform.
7020600	7024600	I'm not doing Patreon anymore either.
7024600	7026600	I don't know where they're going to go then.
7026600	7027600	Interesting.
7027600	7029600	On vacation.
7029600	7030600	Probably.
7030600	7032600	Hopefully.
7032600	7034600	Well, best of luck.
7034600	7037600	Bobby Blackwolf in chat said nobody wanted to pay him, so he shifted what he was doing.
7037600	7045600	There was a lot of people that I saw commenting, like I didn't even know he had a Patreon to use.
7045600	7049600	But Bobby does clarify that he's leaving the industry.
7049600	7055600	As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, I didn't follow Nabelle, but I respected the work they did.
7055600	7057600	All right.
7057600	7059600	Moving on, I got one more story.
7059600	7065600	Kind of a cute little feel-good-ish type of story that goes back to our roots and where we all met each other.
7065600	7072600	Of course, playing music games in the arcade, Dance Dance Revolution, and we met many great people through the years playing in the arcade.
7072600	7079600	Somebody else in the music industry who really grew up on DDR was Porter Robinson.
7079600	7081600	Things have come full circle.
7081600	7086600	Porter Robinson now has a song, actually two songs, in Dance Dance Revolution.
7086600	7090600	He actually posted a nice thing on Twitter and Instagram.
7090600	7092600	It was really cute.
7092600	7095600	It says, I'll read the caption here because I'm not going to play the video.
7095600	7098600	The caption says, my songs are coming to DDR officially.
7098600	7102600	It's almost impossible to fully explain how much this means to me.
7102600	7106600	DDR was so formative in my life that I'm certain I'd be a completely different person without it.
7106600	7114600	In fact, the only reason I started trying to make music as a little kid was to make songs for DDR.
7114600	7124600	He talks in the video about how the music, the bright visuals, introducing Japanese music, getting influence from Japanese culture, all that has influenced him.
7124600	7129600	I think we've all seen that DJ set he did where he incorporated Look to the Sky into it.
7129600	7141600	Anyway, a very similar worded song called Look at the Sky, one of his songs from the album Nurture, is going to be added to DDR along with the song Something Comforting.
7141600	7143600	Those were just added to DDR.
7143600	7149600	I believe this last week through the magic of EMUs and the internet and all that are on the DDR machines now.
7149600	7155600	So you can check that out at your local round one or wherever you have a DDR machine that's hooked up to the internet.
7155600	7157600	But congrats to Porter Robinson on that.
7157600	7158600	That was great.
7158600	7161600	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, it was hard not to get a little choked up watching that video.
7161600	7162600	Yeah, for sure.
7162600	7164600	It was awesome.
7164600	7166600	So congrats.
7166600	7167600	That's great.
7167600	7170600	All right.
7170600	7172600	Anyway, Porter Robinson is really cool.
7172600	7175600	His brother's a fucking dick, but he's cool.
7175600	7177600	All right.
7177600	7179600	Anyway, let's move on.
7179600	7188600	Let's talk the listener roundtable and invite your comments over at our Discord server, vog.network.com slash discord.
7188600	7194600	If you want to join our green room, you can do so and we'll bring you on to the show.
7194600	7202600	And if you want to send us a mail email, you can participate at orange songs radio.com is the place to send us an email.
7202600	7206600	Unfortunately, this week I am told we had dust.
7206600	7209600	Anyone know dust?
7209600	7212600	Anyone know dust?
7212600	7215600	So that is an empty mailbag.
7215600	7219600	Participate at orange songs radio.com.
7219600	7227600	And if you have questions for us in chat, we'll take those as well over at twitch.tv slash vog network about anything we didn't talk about yet.
7227600	7230600	Digirama S tags me and says, tell us how you really feel.
7230600	7231600	I did.
7231600	7235600	Loki, do we have any last minute stories?
7235600	7244600	Well, just, you know, something that is kind of annoying, but I guess it's to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Candy Crush.
7244600	7267600	So, of course, they decided to do a huge 500 drone sign just over New York to celebrate Candy Crush and our dystopian future where they're going to be advertising in mobile games in the night sky where you can't avoid it.
7267600	7277600	Is that is that what an appropriate follow up to talking about Porter Robinson's song, look at the sky and see the latest ads guy.
7277600	7279600	It's it's advertisements.
7279600	7280600	We've now resorted.
7280600	7283600	We've now resorted to advertising in space.
7283600	7285600	Like like.
7285600	7291600	It's cool that you're celebrating 10 years of Candy Crush, but you know, you could like.
7291600	7292600	Who's this for?
7292600	7294600	Take out a full page ad in New York Times or something.
7294600	7295600	And then they couldn't do it.
7295600	7302600	They couldn't technically launch it from New York because they have to do it from Jersey because New York's like, no, you can't do that kind of stuff.
7302600	7303600	But they're like.
7303600	7308600	Well, it's going to be so big, you'll see it from Jersey, so it's fine.
7308600	7309600	Yeah.
7309600	7310600	All right.
7310600	7313600	Well, I do not see anybody in the green room.
7313600	7318600	I think we're about out of topics for tonight, so we'll go ahead and move to wrap things up tonight.
7318600	7323600	As a reminder, we will not be here next week just due to personal obligations.
7323600	7325600	Won't be here next week.
7325600	7329600	However, we will be back in two weeks, ironically, on all this DDR talk.
7329600	7330600	Guess what?
7330600	7332600	It is 20 November in two weeks.
7332600	7335600	So we're actually doing a show on 20 November this year.
7335600	7336600	So that's right.
7336600	7340600	And it's episode 937, which is nothing like 573.
7340600	7344600	But like you'd you'd have on Wordle, you'd got two yellow boxes with that.
7344600	7346600	So there's that anyway.
7346600	7348600	Let's wrap things up.
7348600	7351600	I want to say thank you to everybody for listening to our show tonight.
7351600	7356600	Thank you for listening us either live or on the podcast feed, however you chose to
7356600	7357600	consume Orange Launch Radio.
7357600	7359600	Thank you so much for being here and doing so.
7359600	7361600	I really appreciate you.
7361600	7363600	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
7363600	7365600	Oh, if you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend or two.
7365600	7368600	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7368600	7371600	But, you know, we need more voices to put out here on air.
7371600	7373600	So I really appreciate that.
7373600	7377600	So, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, speaking of a fun social thing, we got a general chat
7377600	7380600	room in the VOG Discord now where we can talk about all the things.
7380600	7381600	Come join and chat during the week.
7381600	7382600	Yes.
7382600	7383600	Come say hello.
7383600	7384600	I do.
7384600	7385600	I lurk.
7385600	7389600	I don't always actively chat, but it's hard to shut me up sometimes.
7389600	7390600	So there is that.
7390600	7391600	So.
7391600	7392600	Oh.
7392600	7393600	All right.
7393600	7395600	Dark Sakura, let's go around and get final thoughts.
7395600	7397600	What is your final thought for tonight?
7397600	7399600	I am streaming.
7399600	7403600	I won't be doing a lot of talking, but I would love for people to play with me tonight.
7403600	7405600	All right.
7405600	7406600	Check it out.
7406600	7408600	On that note, I'll pop out.
7408600	7409600	Later taters.
7409600	7410600	Take care.
7410600	7411600	All right.
7411600	7413600	Loki, we'll go to you and your final thought tonight.
7413600	7418600	My final thought is I'll be working more on my content again and hopefully going to fix
7418600	7419600	my DDR machine.
7419600	7421600	I'd be curious to find out what's wrong.
7421600	7422600	Yeah.
7422600	7425600	I want to hook up the actual arcade part of it.
7425600	7426600	I hope it doesn't.
7426600	7427600	I hope that's still working.
7427600	7428600	Yeah.
7428600	7429600	That would be sad.
7429600	7430600	That would be sad.
7430600	7431600	Let's see.
7431600	7436600	But if, you know, you end up having to do something else with that machine, I know people
7436600	7437600	you can talk to.
7437600	7438600	No, no.
7438600	7439600	I would just replace the computer.
7439600	7442600	Like that would just, it would cost like almost nothing.
7442600	7443600	Fair enough.
7443600	7444600	Let's see.
7444600	7445600	My final thought.
7445600	7448600	I don't really have a whole lot that comes to mind automatically.
7448600	7453600	I just, I'm sorry I won't be here next week, but at the same time breaks are important.
7453600	7456600	So, always take a moment to take a break.
7456600	7459600	You know, a lot of things, especially with all the crap going on on social media, a lot
7459600	7462600	of things can feel very overwhelming sometimes.
7462600	7464600	There's just a lot of weird shit out there sometimes.
7464600	7469600	So, like never be ashamed or afraid to take a break.
7469600	7473600	Mental health is important and it's okay to say, I'm not feeling great today.
7473600	7475600	I'm going to take a break.
7475600	7478600	So, not that I'm saying that that's all impacting OLR, but I'm not.
7478600	7481600	I'm just saying, you know, don't apologize for taking a break.
7481600	7482600	Everybody's got to do it once in a while.
7482600	7483600	So, take a break.
7483600	7485600	I guess that's my final thought.
7485600	7486600	All right.
7486600	7487600	That's it.
7487600	7488600	We'll see you next time here on Orange Dance Radio.
7488600	7490600	We'll be back in two weeks.
7490600	7491600	Have a great week.
7491600	7495600	Thank you to all the veterans out there because it is Veterans Day weekend next weekend.
7495600	7497600	That's why it's a long weekend in part.
7497600	7499600	So, thank you to veterans.
7499600	7501600	Enjoy Veterans Day and thank you to everybody.
7501600	7503600	Have a good two weeks.
7503600	7505600	We'll see you back on 20 November.
7505600	7506600	Have a good night, everybody.
