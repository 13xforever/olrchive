Early into the debut of Apple Arcade, an Oregon Trail remaster came out. My two second review? It was well made. I'm a huge fan of the classic Apple II Oregon Trail as well as the first Windows 95 version. The decade since brought a Super Ragon Adventure and Oregon Trail, the one with zombies, and now we're back to palatable edutainment. Yes, my gravestone still says pepperoni and cheese.

00:28.000 --> 00:36.000
This is your Westward Frontier update. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:59.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live here with you tonight on November the 6th of 2022 with episode number 936 of our show.

00:59.000 --> 01:08.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my co host here every week to talk about video games and all that good stuff. Joining me say hello to Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Hey, I think my webcam died.

01:10.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, I was gonna say we don't see you on cam, but that's all right. Things happen. We'll do it live. That's the joys of taping live because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network. Nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackall show.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Camo works now.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
I don't even know what that is. What's camo?

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
It's the one that I use to use my phone as my camera.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Oh.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Camo works, that's why I don't see her.

01:38.000 --> 01:48.000
Dark Soccer used camouflage. It's super effective. Jokes like that and more brought to you by Loki. Hi, Loki.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
That's right. I'm here.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
You are wearing dad flannel making dad jokes. What's that dad game playing in the background behind you tonight?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Burnout Paradise.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh, good.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I couldn't think of anything.

02:02.000 --> 02:11.000
No, it's a good pick. Why not? I like that. Dark Soccer. I see your Zoltar shirt tonight. It's pretty cool. I like that.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah, the shirt that got a cease and desist delivered to coin up game room.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh, I didn't know about that.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, mine. Mine has a stand up a little bit. You can see.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Oh, okay. I see it has actual logo on it. Okay.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah. So it was given to me gifted.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Nice. Well, Dark Soccer, I see your friend who you've brought up on the show previously.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
Fanara is in chat saying you may get dysentery, I believe, commenting on Jason's intro tonight, which we'll get to later.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
But it is it is lovely to see Fanara in chat. It looks like that means she's doing better. I hope that means so.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
I think that she's incrementally better as far as I understand.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
So but she'd have to answer that herself.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Fair enough.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I've been I've talked to my mother yesterday.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
How is she doing?

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
She sounded really bad, but she was in good spirits. It was her 64th birthday.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Oh, happy birthday.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Your mom's the oldest Madonna.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Just an observation. That's all Madonna is also 64.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
Well, at any rate, she sounded she she sounded in good spirits.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
They think that they're figuring out how to beat the pneumonia.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
And she actually says she could take some deeper breaths today.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Oh, good.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
So I'm hoping that.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
Fingers crossed, you know, but I'm still doing my marathon.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I was just about to ask you're doing a marathon, right?

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah, I'm not going to be able to do a whole lot of talking, of course.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
So, wow, it let me in to co-host right away.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
I just immediately signed up and immediately got in.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Oh, the Twitter clone co-host?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Caitlin, let's watch your tangent train focus.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Well, no, I try.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
I had forgotten to sign up, so I just went ahead and did it.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
I thought I'd have to wait, but no, I guess I'm special.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
But anyway, I'm going to be playing Dead by Daylight for 12 hours.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
I might, you know, take a break and do Cult of the Lamb or something,

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
but it's all to raise money for my mom's hospital bill.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
She is completely uninsured.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
This is Alabama.

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
She's had some pretty expensive work and treatment done to her.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
So, you know, I just don't want to do what I can to help out my mom.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
And for those in chat, I'll link the GoFundMe.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
But, you know, if you can make it, it'll be from 12 o'clock p.m. Pacific to 12 midnight.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
However else long I decide to go if I have energy for it or a voice.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
I probably don't have the voice for it.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
But, yeah, I'd appreciate some support even if you just, you know, show up and say hi.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
And speaking of my voice, as you can hear, it's coming and going, but it's getting incrementally better.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I just have to take it easy.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I'm glad to hear it's getting better.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
I was going to point out, too, we're actually not going to be here with Orange Lounge Radio.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
And actually Bobby isn't here either just for like we all have kind of random reasons that we're all not available.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
So it's well, I think Loki's here, but everybody else has some type of commitment next weekend.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
So because you're in a Dead by Daylight tournament or something, right?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
No.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I thought that was next Sunday for you.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I don't know why.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
I'm not in a tournament at all.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I didn't sign up for it.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Why did I think that?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
All right, whatever.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
But I'm not here next Sunday because it would be fun.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah, maybe that's maybe my brain is subconsciously telling you to sign up for one.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I don't know.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
But I won't be here next weekend.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm going on a personal vacation.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
So Alan and I will be up in Seattle.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Bobby's actually not going to be here next weekend either.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
He's doing a personal vacation of sorts as well.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
So say hi to our mutual friends up there.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
For sure.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Can't wait to see some folks up there.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Actually, we did reach out to the streamer that you and I both know that lives up there.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
But they're unavailable.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
So they're also in town.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah, I know the same reason.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah, yeah.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
So, yeah.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Anyway, let's move on and get into tonight's kickoff topic.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
Let's talk about some things that are going on in gaming with you all in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
Fanara did give an update saying still breathing, but COVID-borne potato brain.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Sorry to hear it.

06:53.000 --> 07:01.000
Hopefully, hopefully it gets sorted out sooner rather than later and doesn't doesn't stick around too terribly long.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
All right.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Let's get into some gaming updates.

07:04.000 --> 07:15.000
We'll go over to Loki to start us off tonight with some pretty big, long awaited updates that I would have thought would have had their own press conference or Nintendo Direct style video.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
But no press release Monday morning.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Here we go.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Right.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yep.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
OK.

07:21.000 --> 07:32.000
Sony has finally announced or unveiled to the world more details about the PlayStation VR to mean when we're going to get it and how much it's going to cost.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
It's expensive.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
It's going to be five hundred and fifty dollars.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
It's going to release in February.

07:38.000 --> 07:47.000
And they were talking about that the bundle is going to include Horizon, Call of the Mountain and also include a spin.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
I guess.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah, I think that's it.

07:50.000 --> 07:59.000
It just includes that they're going to have 11 other games that are going to be coming out for it or ports that are set the release during the first year.

07:59.000 --> 08:11.000
So we've got looks like Crossfire, Sierra Squad, the Light Brigade, Cities VR enhanced edition.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Cosmonia is high.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Hello, neighbors.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Search and rescue.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Man, that game is like.

08:16.000 --> 08:27.000
Changed Jurassic World Aftermath Collection, Pistol Whip VR, Zenith, the last city after the fall tent clear.

08:27.000 --> 08:35.000
And my personal favorite, the dark picture is switchback VR, which is a spiritual successor to Until Dawn Rush of Blood.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
You know, I'm all about that.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
So, yeah, when I saw that, I was like, oh, Loki got his wish.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I got my wish.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Yes.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Congratulations.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
That's all.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
That always feels good when the game makers grant your wish.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yeah.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Although it isn't I mean, it isn't until dawn.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
But, you know, I guess it wouldn't.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
It's fine.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
I don't really care.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
It's a spiritual successor.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
It's not, you know, there really is.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I didn't like that until dawn.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
So it's fine.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
I'm totally on board with it being something different.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't know what the dark picture I think is that dark picture is like there.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Overarching like universe.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
I think so.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
But then you have things like the quarry that didn't get branded into that.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
But there were other games that were in that.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
So I think it's I think it's like one of their multiverses.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
Basically, the dark pictures makes me think of like that thing that Universal is trying to do with like the new Mummy movie.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Oh, no.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
And this is what PlayStations got.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
It's way more popular.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I know that.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
It's just like I hear that.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
And I was like, how does this tie in with the Mummy?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
The Invisible Man.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
Honestly, that's the approach maybe the Universal should take for that whole thing is make it a gaming universe.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Wouldn't that be something be better than that Tom Cruise?

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
The only way the Mummy is going to get better is to bring Brendan Fraser back.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
That's that's the reality.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I guess.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
But yeah, I'm very excited to see that.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
The rest of the I don't really care.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
But let me let me piggyback on that.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
So are you saying that like you're sold on PSVR, too, just so you can play that one game?

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Or are you kind of like, no, that's a lot of money.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
I'm just hoping that if I wait long enough, they'll just port the PC, please.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
That's that's that's a lot of that's a lot of cash for one game.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
And I'm not dropping that kind of cash for one game.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I do as much as I like to see it.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
I do really want a PSVR, too, eventually.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm not I mean, again, I'm not quite sold that any of these launch titles are like need to have for me.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
But I'll kind of wait and see how the, you know, early reception is to it.

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
And, you know, kind of what the what social media ability because, my God, like, it's just going to be scalped up to hell.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And yeah, that worries me, too.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
I just mean, it could be 20, 24.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
We're looking into being able to get something like this.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Well, and even then, it's what else did they put out?

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Let me put it this way. Shane sent me a text and was like, hey, are you getting a PSVR, too?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I'm like, no, I'm not going to buy one right away. I don't have a PS5 still.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
He's like, great. Can I use your sign up to get an extra chance?

11:13.000 --> 11:21.000
It's like, sure. I'm like, but actually, honestly, if I do if I do get in there to get a PlayStation PSVR, too.

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
That's not a very intelligent system because it should know I have never played on a PlayStation five.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Like, hey, they would know I never bought bought a PS5 for them.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Sure, I could have got one from Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon, you know, one of the other many places selling a PS5.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
But they should still be able to know I have never logged into a PlayStation five.

11:39.000 --> 11:46.000
I'm trying to think even like when I played PlayStation five at other people's houses, like in Bobby's theater and stuff,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I didn't log into my own account or anything. I don't remember doing that. I'm confident.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
I don't think I would have done that. There's no reason to.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
So it's not going to they should know I've never touched a PS5. They shouldn't sell me one of these.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
So it's going to be really funny if I get an invite and he doesn't.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
I'm just going to have to wait, you know, and see what happens with it.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
I mean, it's like I said, you know, that's that's too much money for one game.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
There needs to be like more to bring me to it. And I need that Tetris effect style game.

12:17.000 --> 12:27.000
I mean, I do love No Man's Sky. I didn't love playing it in VR for an extended period of time because I start to get like the eye pull and like the.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
But I'm wondering if the advances in technology are going to help with a lot of that, because I just I really want to just also like try the technology.

12:34.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah. So I'm kind of I'm I'm super curious to see how like something like No Man's Sky, which they're not just remember, they're they're technically calling it a PSVR to release.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
It is separate from what they did for, you know, the original PSVR.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
So I'm just kind of curious to see what they do with it, because I did enjoy playing No Man's Sky in VR, but just not for very long.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah. I mean, there's like some of the other games that they're showing off, like Tentacular looks funny.

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
You're like a giant octopus thing. The Horizon spinoff looks really looks really good.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
Yeah. I mean, that looks good. I don't know. Cities VR could be cool, I guess.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
They need to get Mizuguchi to do something for it if they are already. I would be very surprised if to see Mizuguchi is not making some.

13:20.000 --> 13:32.000
And of course, that's the mind behind Tetris Effect. But going back to Rez, you know, some of the other classic games, a lot of the old classic Sega titles, I would really hope he's making something for PSVR, too.

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah, hey, what about that Rez thing that we, you know, we were teased with, you know?

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
Oh, what? Area X, which very clearly is a prototype for a sequel to Rez, for a Rez 2 or a new Rez game.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
Area X, if you watch the credits for Area X, you will, I know I've brought this up on the show before, but it's not like I haven't repeated myself before.

13:53.000 --> 14:01.000
I'm going to remind everybody, if you actually watch the credits, you see at the very end, Area X is powered by the synesthesia engine.

14:01.000 --> 14:10.000
And if you actually watch the Tetris Effect credits, it's powered by the same engine. So they built that engine to make games in.

14:10.000 --> 14:22.000
And I really think Rez was, like Area X was supposed to be its own game, which is a bummer it wasn't fully realized because I love Area X and the music is so good in the Rez.

14:22.000 --> 14:31.000
And this was the Rez, what, Rez VR, but they also, I think they released it in non-VR spaces as well, I want to say, because you can play Area X without being in VR.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah, Rez HD or something like that.

14:32.000 --> 14:39.000
Yeah, Rez HD. Sorry, they've re-released Rez so many times now, I forget what the different ones are differentiated, but the latest one that they did.

14:39.000 --> 14:49.000
And the VR one was pretty awesome. It was fun to play it in VR. It's just, yeah, it would be cooler to see something, you know, it's kind of showing its age a little bit.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah, a little bit, you know, it's a great game, but it's...

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
How about Justice for Child of Eden? You know, that game kind of came and went and it wasn't bad.

14:58.000 --> 15:12.000
I liked that one a lot. I thought that was a really great game. And it kind of reminds me a lot of the Tetris Effect type stuff where they had a lot of that kind of earthy, you know, imagery and stuff like that with Child of Eden.

15:12.000 --> 15:25.000
I would love to see Mizuguchi to get a really strong license. Oh, I guess. And honestly, he did with Tetris. I mean, Tetris is a huge license, but I think he and his, you know, builders have really proved themselves with that.

15:25.000 --> 15:38.000
Like I think of, do you remember when Xbox Connect launched one of the early games they had for it? This might have been Xbox One, the line's a little blurry, but was the Fantasia thing? Disney Fantasia was the thing that they had on it?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah, that was Connect.

15:39.000 --> 15:52.000
Can you imagine if Mizuguchi had like a Disney license to make a Disney game in VR? That would be phenomenal. So I would love to see him get a huge like, I mean, of course, he makes great originals too.

15:52.000 --> 16:05.000
So I can't say like, oh, you know, I'm not gonna be excited about whatever that guy makes next. But I would love for him to get a big, big license to play with besides Tetris, which honestly is already a big license, I guess.

16:05.000 --> 16:13.000
So there is that. I think they will make a Tetris effect too as well. I think they have to. So yeah, we'll see. I just hope you know that.

16:16.000 --> 16:27.000
The Switchback VR comes out on PC. I do see like some of the stuff that they're talking about, though, that like, and this is some of the things I and I sort of got it from the trailer and I'm not entirely sure.

16:27.000 --> 16:48.000
So the with the PlayStation VR has the head tracking. Remember? Yeah, it has your eye tracking. Yep. So unlike, you know, that one scene in Until Dawn Rush of Blood, because there's a lot of stuff that's obviously in this trailer that they've done before with the mannequins where it will basically the mannequins will move if you don't look at them.

16:49.000 --> 17:00.000
But this one, it'll like they'll move if you blink your eyes. Oh, man. So they're weeping angels. Yeah, that's scary. I want to play this game so bad.

17:00.000 --> 17:15.000
Prince Peach Fuzz is in our chat. Hi, I haven't seen that name in a while. Hope you're well, says I'm surprised they didn't call it the PS VR slim. Cute name. And it is that is one attractive thing about it. It's way less wires and way less bullshit for your living room.

17:15.000 --> 17:44.000
Game changer. So it is a slim but remember it and this is a big reason why you know, we talked about why don't the PS VR games just work on PS VR to it's because it's it's really rebuilt places VR and it's low key was saying it's a different type of tracking. It's not tracking through the camera anymore. Like you know, the original one was it's not using like the moves this red and blue dots. It's it's completely built different when it Yeah, it's inside out tracking. It's like completely different so they wouldn't be able to port. And they could be a little bit different.

17:45.000 --> 17:57.000
They could probably you could remake your games, I guess using that tracking, but it wouldn't be something that they could just say, Oh, there's gonna be backwards compatibility with these that would be very difficult for them to do.

17:57.000 --> 18:05.480
Fanara is in chat saying dreamlight Valley VR dropkick Donald, I think that would be a Kingdom Hearts VR heal me son of a bitch. All right.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.840
This is their Kingdom Hearts VR game.

18:08.240 --> 18:17.680
I think it was like a spin off. It wasn't like an actual mainline. But you know how there's you know, Kingdom Hearts VR 36 over to Jupiter.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.360
For matching service

18:21.360 --> 18:23.600
for matching service featuring true kids destination.

18:24.320 --> 18:31.720
I thought that they had like it was either a Kingdom Hearts or it was like a Final Fantasy. I thought they had a VR thing.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.160
There was Bobby says it was an experience, not a game.

18:35.480 --> 18:39.800
Well, right. They're all experiences. That's that's the thing that sucked to like what was it?

18:39.840 --> 18:44.560
There was there was a Utada Hikaru experience where you just watch them sing a song.

18:45.080 --> 18:55.960
Yeah, there was that one game because so this is the best part. And this would be my hope if the PlayStation VR to it. I hope it comes with this.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.680
Like, don't get me wrong, like,

19:00.920 --> 19:13.880
it's expensive. But one of the things I liked about the first one was it came with that demo disk. And I understand that we're past the age of demo disk. But come on, like, let's just indulge us a little bit. Like

19:14.400 --> 19:16.280
give me access to the demo cloud.

19:16.840 --> 19:21.240
No, no, no. That got me that got me by for like such a long time because it had

19:22.560 --> 19:26.640
it had that first stage of Until Dawn Rush of Blood, which is fantastic.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.200
I mean, not that you wouldn't just buy it anyways, because it's like 20 bucks.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.000
It was just such a stupid like.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.520
Such an easy decision to make.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.200
But they had that it had like,

19:39.200 --> 19:43.640
you know, I'm assuming they're going to do something with like playroom with this that'll probably be free as well.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.840
Or maybe AstroBots, which might not be free.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.800
And then, God, there was this like flight sim game.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.440
That was pretty awesome.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.200
But it was an experience.

19:55.480 --> 19:59.480
And so like it was like getting good.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.720
And it's just, oh, and fade black.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.960
And I guess that's how the actual game was, too.

20:03.960 --> 20:08.040
So I'm hoping that we get some longer experiences now that,

20:08.440 --> 20:14.560
you know, this system can run Unreal five and it can run more powerful things.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.440
And so I'm curious to see what they come out with.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.320
Prince Peach Fuzz in chat says Wii Sports was fantastic.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.280
And it was basically a demo disk, right?

20:23.280 --> 20:29.080
Well, Nintendo is so good at packaging their tech demos into like games like what was one,

20:29.360 --> 20:33.840
one to switch was just that is nothing but a tech demo compilation.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.560
Yeah, that didn't work out so well for them once you switch.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.160
But then they tried it again.

20:38.160 --> 20:42.040
I mean, they feel like more people bought that than probably should have.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.880
But yeah, Wii Sports, they tried to do it again with Wii Play and even tried to like,

20:45.920 --> 20:49.480
well, we'll give you a controller and Wii remote plus with that.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.480
Oh, yeah, I remember that thing where made the controller like five feet long.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.160
And then there, but Wii Fit was a runaway success.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.520
Yeah, Wii Fit balance boards that are stacked up at your local, you know,

21:02.520 --> 21:04.800
your local trade in store

21:06.360 --> 21:08.760
thrift store, you know, it's just like, hey,

21:09.040 --> 21:12.440
there will be a renaissance when they try to find a plastic guitar now.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.280
That was the joke. Five years ago. Try to find one now.

21:15.280 --> 21:19.200
They're not easy to find anymore because, you know, you go to the store there.

21:19.440 --> 21:22.280
Oh, you got to be not being the great may not be in the greatest

21:23.200 --> 21:25.440
like DJ Hero Controller is like crazy.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.280
They're like seriously all the time.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.040
Interesting, but they may not be in the greatest shape,

21:30.040 --> 21:34.200
but you just buy a few of them and swap parts around and you get work in one.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.480
I want to read some other comments in chat.

21:36.480 --> 21:39.440
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I think it was smart for them to announce this,

21:39.440 --> 21:41.480
especially the price in this blog post.

21:41.760 --> 21:45.280
We all knew the price was going to sting, dropping the price in a blog,

21:45.280 --> 21:48.920
soften the blow and avoided a possible five hundred and ninety nine

21:48.920 --> 21:51.680
U.S. dollars moment when that's like what they're asking.

21:51.680 --> 21:54.280
It's only five hundred fifty U.S. dollars.

21:54.280 --> 21:58.400
But well, they are selling a horizon bundle that is five hundred and ninety

21:58.400 --> 21:59.360
nine U.S. dollars.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.160
So there is that. But oh, it's not free.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.440
I thought that was just included.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.960
Oh, at least that's not the impression I got.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.640
Of course. Am I wrong?

22:07.640 --> 22:11.000
The company that charges seventy dollars for the Horizon Party games.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.280
Yeah, let's see.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.640
There was another good comment.

22:14.640 --> 22:18.080
Oh, she helped ten said, Is it compatible with Pornhub?

22:18.760 --> 22:21.640
You know, you laugh, you joke.

22:21.640 --> 22:22.400
Well, maybe you don't.

22:22.400 --> 22:26.160
But I say a lot of people would say that with tongue firmly planted in cheek.

22:26.160 --> 22:32.120
But a lot of times the winning media format is chosen by the porn industry.

22:32.800 --> 22:36.960
And certainly pornography exists in VR, at least on PC.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.120
Is does the PlayStation five have a web browser?

22:40.360 --> 22:42.520
Because I don't think that they do.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.920
They I don't know. That's a question for chat.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.120
Just chat. No, just PlayStation five have a web browser

22:48.120 --> 22:50.680
because Xbox Series X still has Edge built in.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.800
So there's that Microsoft.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.800
I know, but I'm just saying it's not like they

22:55.280 --> 22:58.200
they all got rid of them with the current generation of consoles.

22:58.240 --> 23:02.560
I just thought they wouldn't because like, you know, well, so it opens them up for

23:03.360 --> 23:05.200
all for having Sony.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.040
Just remember, Sony does not allow adults

23:08.040 --> 23:11.440
only rated content because that's why the ESRB exists. Right.

23:11.440 --> 23:15.440
So if your game is really rated adults only, you can't sell it

23:15.440 --> 23:18.560
officially on the Sony platform in the marketplace or anything like that.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.800
In fact, all the all the big game companies have that same rule.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.280
Got to go to PC and Steam.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.160
Yeah, you got to go to PC and Steam if you end up with that rating.

23:27.040 --> 23:33.120
So would there be officially sanctioned porn on PlayStation VR, too?

23:33.320 --> 23:37.040
No. But what Loki is alluding to is there

23:37.040 --> 23:39.840
if there was a web browser, could we get porn? Of course.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.440
Bobby Blackwell says the PlayStation five has the ability to show

23:44.440 --> 23:46.200
and interact with web pages.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.640
But I can't remember if you can access the web browser directly

23:48.640 --> 23:49.560
and give it a URL.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.440
Well, I'm sure if if porn is involved.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.680
Somebody will figure it out.

23:55.680 --> 24:00.200
Bet. All right, let's move on

24:00.520 --> 24:04.480
and talk about our gaming weeks, porn games or otherwise,

24:04.480 --> 24:07.520
but I'm thinking everybody had a pretty PG rated week, but we'll see.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.360
So let's go around and check out in on our gaming weeks.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.760
Dark Soccer will start with you. How was your gaming week?

24:14.080 --> 24:15.520
It was all right.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.400
I played Dead by Daylight.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.960
I played Final Fantasy five.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.760
I am now on the next map of the game.

24:24.040 --> 24:27.000
Cult of the Lamb, some pinball.

24:29.240 --> 24:32.120
Played a little word scapes and kind of pissed off at them, though.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.880
But mostly that.

24:36.880 --> 24:41.440
And I've also taken up playing with 3D rendering software now.

24:42.200 --> 24:46.000
So. Just. Just.

24:47.560 --> 24:52.240
The usual. Actually, we picked up our Genesis

24:52.240 --> 24:54.440
two mini arrived today.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.360
We haven't hooked it up yet, but we got it.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.960
And we're talking about getting the import. So.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.520
Nice. It's little is very little.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.040
All right. Well, let's go over to Loki.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.400
How was your week?

25:09.800 --> 25:15.120
Well, I tried to play different things, so I dusted off the literally

25:15.400 --> 25:17.680
dusted off the DDR machine

25:18.680 --> 25:20.880
to play some step mania.

25:20.960 --> 25:24.840
And apparently something is up with the computer that I have in it.

25:26.200 --> 25:30.960
It keeps crashing on me, which no, it's fine. It's fine.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.640
I mean, it it's not the actual 573 board that's in there that that's

25:35.880 --> 25:37.080
that's disconnected.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.600
It's running off an actual PC right now.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.560
It's still annoying. I don't know what's wrong with it.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.120
There's not many parts to it.

25:45.200 --> 25:48.800
It's like it's literally a NVMe

25:49.080 --> 25:53.720
SSD card on a motherboard with a tiny bit of RAM and an APO.

25:54.040 --> 25:59.720
So it's one of those probably didn't like being in the garage for years

25:59.880 --> 26:05.400
in the, you know, the dam, the damp winters and the hot summers.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.840
So it could be something minor.

26:08.840 --> 26:12.800
It may even be just like the fact that the way I turn the machine on and off,

26:12.800 --> 26:16.000
there's not like a way to like, you know, exit windows type thing.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.560
You have to just hard turn it off most of the time.

26:18.880 --> 26:21.000
And that can cause

26:21.000 --> 26:27.480
file issues. The first crash I had on it was a it was like a graphics driver crash.

26:27.480 --> 26:32.440
So I'm going to try a few things, but I may have to end up replacing that,

26:33.080 --> 26:36.720
which is fine. I can go back to the actual arcade

26:38.560 --> 26:40.680
and run that instead of step mania.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.120
But, you know, I was just trying to trying to dust it off and.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.160
Exercise like you should.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.720
But yeah, so I did play

26:51.720 --> 26:55.800
I played two and a half songs before it finally crashed the last time.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.960
So there is that.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.960
And then, of course, Minecraft is working on stuff this week.

27:01.960 --> 27:05.840
I've put out an episode earlier today, though that's out there now

27:06.600 --> 27:08.960
starting to get the robot masters in there now,

27:09.360 --> 27:13.080
because if you don't know, I've been building in a Mega Man theme.

27:13.080 --> 27:18.680
So we're having I'm creating eight unique robot masters for my series.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.640
And so the first one, Creeper Man's got his

27:22.720 --> 27:23.920
area being built out.

27:23.920 --> 27:27.360
So I built a giant tree from a game I have not played yet.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.600
Mega Man zero two.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.640
It's I'm going to try to pronounce it because it's like Norse.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.000
I think it's Yggdrasil.

27:34.640 --> 27:37.720
Oh, yeah. And it's the tree of life.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.360
And it's World Tree.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.400
Yes, the World Tree.

27:41.400 --> 27:45.200
So in, I guess, that game once again, haven't played it, don't know the lore.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.720
I think I guess X has like trapped a dark elf.

27:48.720 --> 27:52.160
I don't know where dark elves come for the Mega Man series,

27:52.160 --> 27:54.120
but apparently there's dark elves now.

27:54.120 --> 27:57.240
And so I based it sort of on that.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.720
It's not exact one to one, but I just was kind of inspired by it

28:00.720 --> 28:02.400
to make something. So I have that.

28:02.400 --> 28:05.120
And then I've got some more designs being done.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.160
I have three robot masters done right now.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.160
There's one more being designed right now.

28:09.160 --> 28:13.040
And then I'm getting 3D models made of them to put them in game.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.960
So I have the first two of those almost done.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.040
I've seen those, the finished models for them.

28:20.040 --> 28:23.000
And I'm very excited to have them walking around.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.160
My base is going to be awesome.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.600
So that's in there as well.

28:26.600 --> 28:30.320
But yeah, just be continued on building more stuff, of course, and

28:31.440 --> 28:32.280
putting out more content.

28:32.280 --> 28:34.000
I'm going to try to get some more YouTube shorts going.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.960
I put a rendered one today.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.560
I'm going to keep adding some more in there to try to boost the channel

28:39.560 --> 28:41.280
because YouTube loves it.

28:41.280 --> 28:43.240
Leverage those shorts on TikTok.

28:43.240 --> 28:48.560
Alan started loading his Twitch clips to TikTok using some website,

28:48.560 --> 28:53.760
and he's getting way more views on those than I would ever have thought.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.840
TikTok is like pushing that stuff.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.920
So yeah, Instagram too.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.920
Yeah, the Instagram stories and stuff like that.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.120
Bog Network has a TikTok now.

29:02.120 --> 29:05.200
We haven't leveraged it for anything yet, but the ideas are cooking.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.240
So here we go.

29:09.240 --> 29:10.480
OK, let's see.

29:10.480 --> 29:14.480
So I was just looking in chat at some of the other folks gave me weeks.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.400
Tiger Claw was suggesting the power supply.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.160
I don't know if you saw that.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.000
I don't think it's the power supply.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.400
I mean, it could be, but if it was the power supply,

29:22.400 --> 29:25.320
you would think that it wouldn't just crash after a little bit.

29:25.320 --> 29:29.120
It is running and like the power supply.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.240
I think it's fine.

29:31.240 --> 29:35.880
It could be, but typically if it's a power supply, it just wouldn't turn on.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.720
Not just like crash randomly.

29:38.720 --> 29:42.200
And the power supply is way over like it's like a

29:42.880 --> 29:45.280
I think it's like a 430 watt power supply.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.800
And it's only running like an APU with like nothing.

29:48.800 --> 29:53.200
Like it's just it's it's way too much for what it actually needs.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.640
So I don't think it's going to be an issue there.

29:55.640 --> 30:01.120
But more likely, it's either why I think might have happened.

30:01.120 --> 30:05.600
It could be a heat issue where the cooling

30:05.600 --> 30:08.240
and expanding of the thing might have like

30:09.600 --> 30:13.560
I may need to tighten down the the heat sink on the CPU.

30:14.360 --> 30:17.720
It could be just I need to reload step mania again.

30:17.720 --> 30:21.080
I have to boot it up outside of step mania and see if it crashes

30:21.360 --> 30:24.640
after like a little bit of time because it didn't take long for the crash.

30:25.640 --> 30:29.400
So if it crashes outside of step mania, I know it's something not related to that.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.320
And I just have to check like,

30:32.320 --> 30:35.320
you know, are there any file errors and stuff like that?

30:35.320 --> 30:40.000
It could be something not a lot of parts to replace on that.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.440
So it should be pretty easy to fix that.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.400
There's other ideas in chat there.

30:45.400 --> 30:48.880
Look, if you want to take a picture, I'm talking about machines.

30:48.880 --> 30:49.840
I'll get into my gaming week.

30:49.840 --> 30:54.520
So I went over to round one in Roseville real quick.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.080
It was just really like run in and run out.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.120
I was trying to get a new EMU's card

30:58.120 --> 31:00.760
because I couldn't find my old one, which is so irritating.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.680
I thought for sure once I bought a new one, the old one would pop up.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.200
But it still hasn't yet.

31:05.240 --> 31:09.320
But I went over there and they had the brand new 2DX resident or,

31:09.320 --> 31:13.200
you know, which 2DX 30th style for us old school fans.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.240
But, you know, they give them all actual names now.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.480
So I got to see a little bit of that.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.480
And, you know, some of the other games that they had there, we were just

31:18.480 --> 31:20.880
we were really just in and out of there for like two seconds,

31:21.720 --> 31:24.080
because then we went over to.

31:24.080 --> 31:27.240
So this is a newer friend of mine who really follows like all these

31:27.240 --> 31:30.720
Bamani and music games and, you know, has is a private collector,

31:30.960 --> 31:33.680
went over to another friend's house out in that area

31:33.680 --> 31:36.680
who is also a private collector, small world.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.920
Somebody I met once with dark soccer

31:39.920 --> 31:43.000
and I texted you the details like 12 years ago,

31:43.320 --> 31:47.360
went over to this person's house and this person was setting up

31:47.360 --> 31:50.000
their brand new you beat machine that they just got.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.560
And so I got to play around to you beat.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.400
And they also had a reflect beat, actually.

31:53.400 --> 31:57.480
So I was like, this is just I was like, dang, there's all these.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.480
I thought like Loki was one of the only people in town

31:59.480 --> 32:00.880
that had like a machine in their house.

32:00.880 --> 32:03.200
But no, there's a whole scene of like private.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.800
Oh, there's lots of people. Oh, yeah.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.680
No, I'm I'm learning that real quick.

32:06.680 --> 32:07.600
There's lots of.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.280
Meanwhile, you know, my friends like, what are you going to get a machine?

32:10.280 --> 32:14.120
And I'm like, I've got I've got my BurgerTime replica.

32:14.360 --> 32:17.360
And at some point I'll probably get a Tron replica.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.640
Maybe Santa will bring me one. Who knows?

32:20.160 --> 32:21.920
So at some point there'll be a Tron replica here.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.160
And then that's that's probably.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.480
That's that's going to be it.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.520
I don't see myself fitting in a music game in here.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.440
It's a little noisy, I think so.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.480
Way too much pinball.

32:32.480 --> 32:34.600
Oh, man, a pinball machine would be really fun.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.600
I really it's a bummer.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.480
Like, we have to borrow one.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.240
Well, it's a bummer.

32:39.240 --> 32:41.680
We have to park our cars in the garage because otherwise

32:41.680 --> 32:44.200
I would be very willing to put that kind of stuff in the garage.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.080
But we have no space because the cars.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.720
So, yeah, let's see.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.520
Looking in chat, Dr.

32:51.520 --> 32:52.840
Seuss, it sounds like a fun time.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.640
Yeah, it was as 200.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.480
Matt says, I remember nearly breaking my back,

32:57.480 --> 33:01.040
dragging why our technical machine up three flights of stairs.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.560
Luckily, these guys lived on the bottom floor,

33:03.920 --> 33:07.040
so there was no stairs involved or actually they had a place

33:07.040 --> 33:08.560
that like the stairs were in it.

33:08.560 --> 33:10.440
So you had a bottom floor.

33:10.440 --> 33:12.400
So and that's where everything was.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.000
Oh, yeah.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.720
Bobby Black Wolf and chat brings up.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.600
I played pinball this week.

33:16.600 --> 33:19.920
Bobby Black Wolf is very excited and is writing a very large high

33:19.920 --> 33:23.560
because he finally dethroned me from his own pinball machine,

33:23.560 --> 33:25.320
his rush pinball machine.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.920
You might remember when I was out there visiting, I took the high score.

33:28.200 --> 33:31.680
Bobby, Bobby was a little salty, a little salty about that.

33:31.680 --> 33:36.680
And he but he played and played and played, played and played.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.640
And he just thrown my score, my lucky streak.

33:39.640 --> 33:41.440
So he has his score back.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.960
So you all know what this means.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.680
Number one, I should no longer be banned from that arcade.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.200
So take my picture down.

33:49.200 --> 33:53.480
Except I guess I'm still I'm still the lead of the Tron thing,

33:53.480 --> 33:54.640
so maybe there's that.

33:54.640 --> 33:58.640
But number two, I just have to beat it at Dragon Con 2023.

33:58.640 --> 34:02.760
I now have a new bar to hit in 2023 when I go back.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.080
Let's see.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.960
So other stuff for my gaming week besides

34:08.960 --> 34:11.080
machines, arcade machines and fun things like that.

34:11.960 --> 34:12.840
A lot of the same.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.160
I also been playing quite a bit of Dead by Daylight.

34:15.160 --> 34:18.400
I really was trying to grind out the Halloween event before it was done.

34:18.720 --> 34:22.040
Didn't finish the tomes because I didn't play quite enough Dead by Daylight,

34:22.280 --> 34:23.880
but I farmed enough blood points.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.640
I was up to like a million and a half blood points

34:25.640 --> 34:29.360
where I was able to finish prestigeing Hattie and Yoonjin.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.040
I finished prestige.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.040
I'm trying to get every survivor,

34:32.040 --> 34:34.720
except for the Stranger Things kids for now,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.720
every other survivor to level one prestige so I can get their perks.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.600
Yeah, with the Stranger Things license and the changes they made with that,

34:44.120 --> 34:47.320
Steve and Nancy no longer have transferable perks.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.480
So they're they're lowest on the priority.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.760
I'm putting some in Steve just to get him enough to 15.

34:53.760 --> 34:58.280
So I have four slots open because I have a Escape with Steve challenge.

34:58.720 --> 35:02.040
OK, so so I have to invest in the Stoven.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.160
There you go.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.520
But yeah, I've been been enjoying that.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.600
I did a stream the other night to whatever.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.560
I also stream No Man's Sky,

35:11.560 --> 35:15.560
which I am really, really enjoying relaxed mode in No Man's Sky.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.000
It's really kind of reinvigorated the game for me

35:18.000 --> 35:20.720
because I'm able to kind of.

35:20.720 --> 35:23.280
It's not that I minded the grind in the game before,

35:23.280 --> 35:25.360
but like to have that really eliminated.

35:26.760 --> 35:28.440
Just makes it so much easier

35:28.440 --> 35:32.000
to really feel like you're making progress and kind of pushing forward.

35:32.240 --> 35:35.360
And I think what I'd like to do is really kind of try to set up a really nice.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.720
I think I'm going to even though on stream

35:37.720 --> 35:40.240
I've been setting up a pretty nice base on a planet.

35:40.440 --> 35:43.560
What I'm really trying to do is get to the center of the galaxy

35:43.560 --> 35:47.280
where somewhat spoiler alert, I don't think this is a spoiler.

35:47.840 --> 35:51.480
You unlock other galaxies at the end of the game, basically.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.160
So I want to travel to one of the other galaxies,

35:54.160 --> 35:57.160
which spawns the paradise planets more frequently

35:57.400 --> 35:59.840
and try to establish a base on one of the paradise

36:00.360 --> 36:03.920
planets in the new galaxy and like do a super base type of thing.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.760
So that's like my goal in the game right now.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.080
But I still have a long way to go.

36:08.080 --> 36:12.640
I'm assuming they're going to drop a new expedition on us relatively soon,

36:12.640 --> 36:15.640
because if they don't, we're getting to the time of year

36:15.640 --> 36:18.520
where they're probably going to recycle the old expeditions.

36:18.920 --> 36:23.920
So I if they're going to drop like a six week expedition on us,

36:23.920 --> 36:27.920
they need to do it next week unless they're planning another really short one.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.280
Maybe they're going to do a tie in with another game again.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.200
So it's going to be short.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.080
I I don't know what it would be.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.520
But I mean, they did do the Normandy when

36:36.600 --> 36:38.600
the Mass Effect trilogy came out.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.560
So fingers and toes crossed.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.880
Maybe something can happen there, but we'll see.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.680
So waiting on that.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.960
And then more Final Fantasy 14, because I always play that game.

36:47.960 --> 36:51.000
And yeah, a lot of the lot of the same old, same old stuff.

36:51.560 --> 36:53.720
So not not a lot of new games this week.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.600
But I will I will also make sure I get around to something new this week,

36:56.600 --> 36:58.760
except I am leaving town on Thursday.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.320
This is we don't have a show next week

37:00.320 --> 37:02.720
that gives me two weeks to play something new. So we'll see.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.400
So I did want to mention something real quick that I noticed

37:06.400 --> 37:09.000
and more of an observation. So

37:09.960 --> 37:13.120
a fellow podcaster in the area that we've met before.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.080
David Webb had his had his kid last month.

37:16.440 --> 37:20.040
So congratulations to them for their baby girl.

37:20.280 --> 37:23.640
But it is it dawned on me, though, that I saw a message

37:23.640 --> 37:26.520
from him on Twitter that says I miss podcasting.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.880
I really wish I could go back to that. I was like, wait a second.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.600
Aren't you on the Sacramento's number one gaming podcast?

37:33.560 --> 37:36.440
Well, apparently they haven't been doing a podcast for a year.

37:37.280 --> 37:40.160
So I guess by default, that means we're the number one

37:40.160 --> 37:42.320
Sacramento gaming podcast now.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.480
Yeah. Stop starting shit.

37:46.320 --> 37:50.160
No, because I understand that they're they're really busy in there.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.840
They're they are.

37:51.840 --> 37:56.240
Corey. Yeah, I always I always love to remind Corey.

37:56.240 --> 38:00.480
I guessed it on that episode and I was telling you what Overwatch was all about.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.320
I always love to give him shit over that.

38:02.320 --> 38:05.560
So but I mean, in all seriousness, like congrats to the best for them.

38:05.560 --> 38:08.160
I just yeah, it's a hard time. Yeah.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.840
So that's amazing.

38:10.840 --> 38:15.080
All right. Prince Peach fuzz and chat says Loki makes a great point.

38:15.640 --> 38:16.440
So I don't know.

38:16.440 --> 38:19.280
I guess we'll get a banner made and go to a convention and make it official.

38:19.280 --> 38:19.840
I don't know.

38:20.440 --> 38:23.280
Didn't what did we already establish when that whole, you know,

38:23.280 --> 38:27.600
when we were just, you know, and obviously they've been on this or they went there

38:27.600 --> 38:29.280
when, you know, I thought that they were on this show.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.280
I was on that show.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.920
Like, it's whatever.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.720
It's funny.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.440
But I was going to say

38:38.200 --> 38:39.000
the train derailed.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.520
I was going to say, oh, yeah.

38:40.520 --> 38:44.480
Didn't we at that time say, well, we don't need to be the number one podcast here

38:44.480 --> 38:47.120
because we're the number one podcast in the galaxy.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.240
We're the galaxy's number one podcast.

38:49.240 --> 38:52.560
I think somebody actually wrote that in an iTunes review at some point.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.800
So it's fine.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.400
It's just it's just silly.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.960
It was it was just funny. Yeah. All right.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.400
Let's get into some more gaming news

39:02.400 --> 39:05.960
and some other headlines from the week and we'll go to Loki.

39:07.160 --> 39:10.240
I want to be surprised, but I'm not surprised.

39:10.360 --> 39:15.320
But PlayStation Plus is apparently has lost nearly two million subscribers

39:15.640 --> 39:18.640
after their relaunch and multiple tier thing.

39:18.640 --> 39:22.240
That was utterly confusing and promised a bunch of stuff from PlayStation

39:22.240 --> 39:24.360
now, which I absolutely don't want.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.800
Like, I really don't like PlayStation now.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.040
And I think it was dumb.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.240
And I knew that they were going to offer like,

39:30.240 --> 39:33.200
you know, the PlayStation one games just give us backwards compatibility.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.560
Is it so hard?

39:34.560 --> 39:36.320
Like people already have libraries of that stuff.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.440
Why should we have to pay for backwards compatibility?

39:38.880 --> 39:41.000
Well, apparently, though,

39:42.400 --> 39:45.640
I think one of the problems is a lot of the classic games

39:45.640 --> 39:50.240
that they have promised to bring out have been like slowly like droopy.

39:50.240 --> 39:52.880
It's like almost like the Nintendo online stuff

39:53.400 --> 39:56.120
where it's just slow to come out because.

39:57.280 --> 40:00.000
Licensing, I'm sure.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.080
But yeah, confusion with the overlapping tiers

40:03.080 --> 40:05.520
and, you know, with subscribers

40:06.080 --> 40:10.200
over which tiers of which era of games that they got and stuff like that.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.280
You know, apparently now

40:13.280 --> 40:18.120
it is the most expensive tier is actually increased as well.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.400
It's up 10 percent.

40:21.400 --> 40:26.640
And, you know, the revenue that they're bringing in is it's going up,

40:26.640 --> 40:30.040
but it's just the number of subscribers is kind of declining.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.280
In the second quarter, we renewed our services

40:33.280 --> 40:36.560
and there has been great momentum as a whole, and this is coming from.

40:38.200 --> 40:41.120
Was it a Hiroki to Toki,

40:41.560 --> 40:45.680
who is making his comment on an earnings call, the CFO,

40:46.120 --> 40:49.400
and basically said in the second quarter, yeah, we renewed our services

40:49.400 --> 40:53.000
and there's been a great momentum as a whole before laying some of

40:53.640 --> 40:57.560
they were saying lanes of the blame on the lack of aggressive ad spending

40:58.080 --> 41:00.440
for the service, which is true.

41:00.440 --> 41:05.360
I don't see any advertisements for PlayStation Plus,

41:05.960 --> 41:09.520
but I just think, you know, as far as what I'm getting with PlayStation

41:09.520 --> 41:14.840
Plus versus like, say, Game Pass, it's just seems to be a lot less.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.320
I guess like I kind of made a face and you're talking about the advertising

41:18.320 --> 41:20.200
because I'm like, as if gamers don't know.

41:20.200 --> 41:24.080
But at the same time, I am thinking like, OK, well, like right now

41:25.080 --> 41:28.600
Microsoft is like literally running a promotion with Twitch,

41:29.280 --> 41:32.000
where if you give and I'm not saying this to be self-serving, I promise.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.120
But like if you give two gift subs or something like that, or you

41:35.200 --> 41:40.200
you do two subs on that, you get like a few months of PC game pass for free,

41:40.480 --> 41:42.200
except right catch.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.520
It's only for new subscribers.

41:44.520 --> 41:47.520
It's not for you can't just add the time to an existing thing.

41:47.520 --> 41:52.480
So it's really it's really a lot a longer trial than like 48 hours,

41:52.520 --> 41:55.080
which is their usual giveaway trial for that type of stuff.

41:55.800 --> 41:58.600
They'll do like a month with like discourse or something like that.

41:58.600 --> 41:59.480
Like there's a lot of that.

41:59.480 --> 42:01.160
I haven't seen PlayStation do any of that.

42:01.160 --> 42:04.080
So I will say, OK, yeah, that in that now that I think about it,

42:04.080 --> 42:06.760
like in that sense of advertising, yeah, they're really lacking.

42:07.400 --> 42:11.120
They need to do they have this PlayStation even have a PC component to it.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.440
Like, can I play?

42:13.440 --> 42:18.560
You did, so there is PPS remote play that will allow you

42:18.560 --> 42:21.800
like it's a desktop app that will allow you to connect to your PlayStation.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.120
I would run it right now and show you a live demo

42:24.120 --> 42:25.640
because I have it on my desktop and I've used it.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.640
However, because it makes traffic go through your router

42:28.640 --> 42:31.320
like a lot with the streaming, I don't want it might affect the program.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.040
So I'm going to run it right now.

42:33.040 --> 42:37.480
But it's it's it's just like running the PlayStation in a window on your desktop.

42:37.520 --> 42:38.280
It's extremely great.

42:38.280 --> 42:41.680
But like they have PC games, though, so they couldn't.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.880
They have like a PC.

42:43.880 --> 42:49.120
They cried of it that were like I could play God of War without having to buy it.

42:49.200 --> 42:54.000
Sony, the company could enhance a lot because they could also give.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.160
And I said this a long fucking time ago.

42:56.160 --> 42:59.560
And again, I don't understand why these companies are so siloed

42:59.920 --> 43:03.200
because they can give away movies.

43:03.880 --> 43:06.240
They can give away television shows.

43:06.240 --> 43:10.240
Crunchyroll, you know, the things that are in Sony's wheelhouse.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.280
They could they could partner with all that stuff.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.560
And I think they do for trial because I know somebody is going to say

43:14.560 --> 43:16.360
you can't get a crunchyroll trial.

43:16.360 --> 43:16.960
You know what I mean?

43:16.960 --> 43:20.120
Like there should be things that are incorporated in that,

43:20.120 --> 43:22.600
like a true entertainment pass.

43:22.840 --> 43:24.040
And I'm just kind of surprised.

43:24.040 --> 43:26.760
It seems like a missed opportunity there. So.

43:29.560 --> 43:31.560
Oh, well, I mean,

43:31.560 --> 43:35.040
they'll have to figure out something if they're really interested in retaining.

43:35.160 --> 43:38.680
I'm not sure what percentage the two million was of their total subscribers,

43:38.680 --> 43:43.760
but that's not a like, you know, they apparently see here.

43:43.760 --> 43:47.560
So it's mentioning a games pass has 25 million subscribers.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.160
I guess this isn't a huge chunk then.

43:50.160 --> 43:56.240
So PlayStation Plus last summer had 48 million customers.

43:56.480 --> 43:59.880
I and I'm just going to say what's been holding me back on.

43:59.880 --> 44:02.720
I've never I never signed up for the expanded sub.

44:02.720 --> 44:05.080
I'm still on just the regular PlayStation Plus.

44:05.280 --> 44:08.960
And to be quite honest, I don't even know why I barely you know,

44:08.960 --> 44:11.880
a lot of my gaming is switched to PC over the last few years.

44:12.880 --> 44:16.280
You know, again, when stuff like Final Fantasy 16 and some of the other

44:16.280 --> 44:19.840
exclusives, I'm interested in the, you know, God of War Ragnarok and stuff.

44:20.320 --> 44:23.720
Once that stuff comes out, you know, I certainly will probably change my answer.

44:23.720 --> 44:29.960
But I part of why I've resisted not signing up for the expanded service

44:29.960 --> 44:34.120
is that I just I think the retro offerings especially are pathetic

44:34.560 --> 44:37.320
for what Sony has access to in their library.

44:37.560 --> 44:40.040
I think their retro offerings are downright pathetic.

44:40.600 --> 44:43.600
Yeah. And they really need to up their game.

44:43.600 --> 44:46.040
I mean, we give Nintendo a lot of crap,

44:46.280 --> 44:50.760
but at least to Nintendo's credit, as far as NES and Super Nintendo go,

44:51.080 --> 44:55.520
pretty much any first party title that doesn't have a licensing twist

44:55.520 --> 44:57.560
to it is now on the switch.

44:58.200 --> 45:01.400
Anything that's like a game where you're like, God, I really want this game

45:01.400 --> 45:04.320
is probably I'm sure somebody is going to think of a first party game

45:04.320 --> 45:05.520
that escapes me right now.

45:05.520 --> 45:08.240
But for the most part, again, if it's a licensing issue, that's different.

45:08.440 --> 45:10.640
But for the most part, first party games are all there now.

45:10.800 --> 45:13.840
It's the third party stuff that, you know, anything you want, like,

45:13.840 --> 45:16.960
you know, more Castlevania games or something they're lacking

45:16.960 --> 45:19.120
because the third parties aren't jumping on that.

45:19.120 --> 45:22.920
And so I really feel like Sony's service

45:23.280 --> 45:25.640
has very minimal third party representation

45:25.640 --> 45:28.080
and it's still missing a ton of first party games.

45:28.080 --> 45:32.160
So for me, that's why it hasn't caught on for me personally.

45:34.720 --> 45:37.640
Anyway, let's move on.

45:37.640 --> 45:42.040
We'll talk about what's going on with streaming over on Xbox

45:42.520 --> 45:45.560
with the xCloud, which, of course, is another streaming solution.

45:46.240 --> 45:50.120
And xCloud is something that you can run on Steam Deck and Chrome OS

45:50.120 --> 45:52.280
as some different places.

45:52.280 --> 45:55.640
And if you are using xCloud through one of those services,

45:55.960 --> 45:59.720
you are getting a little bit of an upgrade because now there is a higher

45:59.720 --> 46:02.600
resolution that's being pushed to those platforms.

46:03.360 --> 46:06.120
An Xbox employee on Windows Center, excuse me,

46:06.880 --> 46:09.840
wrote on Reddit and then Windows Central did the original report on this.

46:10.440 --> 46:13.520
An Xbox employee wrote on Reddit that the update is an end

46:13.520 --> 46:16.240
of a transition to a different type of streaming tech.

46:16.560 --> 46:19.120
They did not go into the details about what that is.

46:19.680 --> 46:23.040
But basically, if you use a browser to get to xCloud gaming,

46:23.240 --> 46:26.280
even if that's iOS on your phone or iPad, whatever it is,

46:26.480 --> 46:29.720
you're going to have what they call a more consistent experience.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.080
So remember, you know, xCloud works on a lot of different places.

46:34.840 --> 46:37.640
Meta plans to bring it to the MetaQuest 2 as well.

46:38.440 --> 46:39.680
So there is that.

46:39.680 --> 46:43.840
But yeah, Microsoft is also said to be eager for Steam Deck users

46:43.840 --> 46:45.720
to access the xCloud gaming.

46:45.720 --> 46:48.400
There is not an official Xbox app for the system yet,

46:48.400 --> 46:52.440
but there is a guide for setting up the service on Stream Deck.

46:52.480 --> 46:55.040
So it's not often you see a company like Microsoft

46:55.040 --> 46:58.000
kind of embrace a guide on how to do a work around.

46:58.280 --> 47:00.440
But you know what? They want to get people on the cloud.

47:00.440 --> 47:01.880
That's what they're going to do.

47:01.880 --> 47:03.920
So I like xCloud.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.520
I don't use a lot of cloud gaming right now

47:06.520 --> 47:08.840
just because I did buy a nice computer

47:08.840 --> 47:11.440
where I don't really need to leverage the cloud for a lot right now.

47:11.760 --> 47:16.720
But I like that there's a lot of games available on it and so forth.

47:16.960 --> 47:22.320
I like that Microsoft is being very aware about trying to get it everywhere

47:22.320 --> 47:25.680
and that by them publishing a guide like here's how to get it on Steam Deck,

47:25.920 --> 47:28.640
like they know that's a huge opportunity for them

47:28.640 --> 47:31.160
is to get on those Steam Decks and expand people's library.

47:31.160 --> 47:32.680
I think that's just really smart.

47:32.680 --> 47:37.600
So She Hulk 10 and chat along with 100 biddies.

47:37.600 --> 47:38.480
So thank you very much.

47:38.480 --> 47:41.240
Says the cloud is the future. Don't fight it.

47:41.640 --> 47:44.480
I do agree. The cloud is the future.

47:45.520 --> 47:48.040
It's, I think, a little slower to take

47:48.440 --> 47:51.040
than maybe most people are waiting, you know, ready for.

47:51.040 --> 47:52.800
But again, I've said this a long time.

47:52.800 --> 47:55.680
When 5G is more widely available in the US,

47:56.440 --> 47:59.040
cloud gaming is going to really take off.

47:59.040 --> 48:02.160
Just a matter of time, and we're going to see more games like

48:02.680 --> 48:05.840
you know, the promised upcoming Hideo Kojima game.

48:06.080 --> 48:10.400
Not to get too much into what's up next, but Kojima has mentioned

48:10.840 --> 48:14.920
he's working with Microsoft on something that incorporates new cloud technology.

48:14.920 --> 48:19.200
So you're going to see games that incorporate cloud technology.

48:19.720 --> 48:22.760
But before I say too much, let's go to our next story from Dark Sakura.

48:24.600 --> 48:29.480
There has been footage leaked of Kojima's unannounced game.

48:29.480 --> 48:35.520
They show the video with a character

48:35.520 --> 48:38.760
who looks like Margaret Qualley, who was in Death Stranding.

48:40.760 --> 48:42.960
And there's a jump scare that says game over

48:42.960 --> 48:47.000
and then a Hideo Kojima game and then overdose.

48:48.120 --> 48:52.120
So, of course, Kojima Pro requested it to be removed.

48:54.680 --> 48:58.520
But this may be related to

48:58.680 --> 49:02.080
when he was saying he's watching horror movies, prepping for a future project.

49:04.200 --> 49:07.800
And then the fact that he said he is working on a cloud based

49:07.800 --> 49:10.360
project with Xbox, this could very well be it.

49:11.680 --> 49:14.440
I don't know if you actually got to see the video

49:14.440 --> 49:16.480
because something really funny happens in it.

49:16.480 --> 49:20.520
But like in the leaked video, once the overdose logo comes up,

49:20.520 --> 49:22.480
it's on the mostly black screen.

49:22.480 --> 49:26.640
So the monitor is reflective and you can see the person filming.

49:26.640 --> 49:28.800
It is some dude without a shirt.

49:29.720 --> 49:31.400
You can't you can't see his face.

49:31.400 --> 49:36.640
So you just see man boobs like staring you in the face

49:37.240 --> 49:38.760
next to the overdose logo.

49:38.760 --> 49:40.600
And I'm like, that's the jump scare.

49:41.680 --> 49:44.760
And I didn't know.

49:44.760 --> 49:47.000
Of course, I watched the footage.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.080
I had to. I didn't.

49:49.920 --> 49:55.000
Also, though, has been confirmation by Norman Reedus

49:55.000 --> 49:59.600
that there is a sequel confirmed for Death Stranding in the works.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.840
So interesting.

50:02.840 --> 50:06.880
Well, the game awards are going to be sooner rather than later.

50:06.880 --> 50:09.040
Believe it or not, that's going to be in like a month.

50:09.040 --> 50:13.600
So I would guess if I have a new Hideo Kojima game to announce,

50:14.280 --> 50:17.800
that might be the place to do it, because, you know, Kojima and Jeff Keighley,

50:19.040 --> 50:20.200
they're best buds.

50:20.200 --> 50:23.040
So that would be the place to see it.

50:23.400 --> 50:27.640
And I wonder if that leaked footage from shirtless dude

50:27.920 --> 50:33.200
wasn't some type of early footage to practice with the game awards.

50:33.240 --> 50:36.320
So I wonder if the shirtless dude isn't somebody that works for Keighley

50:36.320 --> 50:38.240
or somebody on that. I mean, who knows?

50:38.240 --> 50:41.840
Or the whole thing could be a really fucking elaborate hoax,

50:41.840 --> 50:43.480
which sometimes these things turn into.

50:43.480 --> 50:46.400
But I don't know that was if it's a hoax.

50:46.680 --> 50:48.800
It was a really well done hoax.

50:48.800 --> 50:51.480
But there are other ways to post shirtless selfies

50:51.640 --> 50:53.480
on your body progress to the Internet.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.080
I'm just saying there are other way.

50:55.080 --> 50:56.520
Get get get it.

50:56.520 --> 50:58.280
Tumblr is cool with that.

50:58.280 --> 51:01.520
Now get a tumbler.

51:01.520 --> 51:03.440
The debate that they tumble back in that direction.

51:03.440 --> 51:07.360
They tumbled back into not not hardcore pornography,

51:07.360 --> 51:09.840
but artistic nudes are OK now.

51:10.200 --> 51:13.440
So if you want to celebrate the human form, I'm trying to remember what they said.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.520
They're going to celebrate the human form.

51:16.160 --> 51:19.720
If you're like, I woke up like this and you have a boner

51:19.760 --> 51:21.960
that you're posting on Tumblr, you can do that now.

51:22.600 --> 51:24.920
But you cannot post.

51:25.320 --> 51:27.400
But no one wants to see that.

51:27.400 --> 51:31.200
Yeah. Well, I don't want to see that.

51:31.360 --> 51:35.200
I was going to say the Internet, keep your body parts in your bedroom.

51:36.360 --> 51:38.440
Use use hashtags.

51:38.440 --> 51:41.960
So Jamie, commute the one she doesn't want to see or anyone for that matter.

51:43.960 --> 51:47.360
Tiger Claw on chat says, Watch the new game be Death Stranding 2.

51:47.560 --> 51:51.720
Why? I mean, couldn't the two games be the same thing?

51:52.400 --> 51:54.960
Couldn't it be Death Stranding 2 overdose?

51:55.440 --> 51:57.000
I know it's a stretch.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.200
Who's to say Death Stranding 2 can't be a horror game?

51:59.320 --> 52:02.080
We've seen games cross genres as sequels before.

52:04.120 --> 52:05.480
Just a thought. It could.

52:05.480 --> 52:08.840
I mean, but I know it's a stretch, but it could anyway.

52:09.960 --> 52:13.560
Speaking of things that are a stretch.

52:13.560 --> 52:17.080
Is it really a stretch in this year of 2022?

52:17.080 --> 52:19.160
Convincing me to buy it is the stretch.

52:19.400 --> 52:24.040
Oh, yeah, they're really stretchy like taffy.

52:25.680 --> 52:29.160
So Square Enix has decided, hey, we're going to announce

52:29.160 --> 52:32.840
our brand new NFT collectible art project.

52:32.880 --> 52:37.080
Oh, yeah. I know you guys are super hyped for symbiogenesis.

52:37.840 --> 52:39.760
I know that Parasite Eve reboot.

52:39.760 --> 52:43.120
By the sound of that, you think it's Parasite Eve, but no, no.

52:43.320 --> 52:46.960
The only parasite we're going to be putting out in the world

52:47.400 --> 52:50.200
is the ask for cryptocurrency and,

52:50.760 --> 52:53.400
you know, these profile pics that you might be able to use with this.

52:54.800 --> 52:57.720
But yeah, apparently it's art that

52:58.560 --> 53:01.560
some sort of art project that you'll be able to.

53:02.760 --> 53:06.640
Untangle some story and get NFTs,

53:06.640 --> 53:09.560
and it's a big old scam sounding thing, so.

53:10.720 --> 53:14.080
Yeah, I'm not not excited about that at all,

53:14.080 --> 53:16.640
and I think it's stupid and I hope it flops.

53:16.640 --> 53:19.120
I hope it fails so fast.

53:20.680 --> 53:23.920
All right. Well, Square Enix has not had a good week

53:23.920 --> 53:26.720
and not even Yoshi P could save Square Enix from this week,

53:26.720 --> 53:29.200
even though he's saved the Final Fantasy franchise.

53:30.080 --> 53:33.400
He's not immune from having some really bad trade

53:33.480 --> 53:35.600
takes trademark patent pending.

53:35.880 --> 53:39.920
And boy, was there one this week and there was a new IGN interview

53:40.200 --> 53:43.840
that was posted with Naoki Yoshida talking about some things

53:43.840 --> 53:45.960
about Final Fantasy 16.

53:45.960 --> 53:48.440
But the portion that's gotten a lot of people's attention

53:48.960 --> 53:53.400
has to do with his answer when he was confronted with the question.

53:53.400 --> 53:57.440
Basically, you know, we've had all these trailers for Final Fantasy 16.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.800
Are there going to be black people in the game?

54:00.800 --> 54:02.640
Are there going to be a diverse

54:03.480 --> 54:05.520
group of people in Final Fantasy 16?

54:05.520 --> 54:07.600
Because we're not seeing him in the trailer.

54:07.600 --> 54:12.200
And in a really long answer, Yoshi P basically said no.

54:13.200 --> 54:15.120
In part, here's an excerpt.

54:15.120 --> 54:18.120
Ultimately, we felt that while incorporating ethnic diversity

54:18.120 --> 54:22.240
into vallustesia, I think is the name of the world there was important,

54:22.440 --> 54:26.080
an over incorporation into the single corner of a much larger world

54:26.080 --> 54:28.800
could end up causing a violation of those narrative boundaries

54:29.040 --> 54:31.000
we originally set for ourselves.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.040
The story we are telling is fantasy, yes, but it's also rooted in reality.

54:35.520 --> 54:40.720
So basically, I'm going to really liberally cut edges here.

54:40.720 --> 54:44.520
But what I'm hearing out of what Yoshi P was saying was basically

54:45.360 --> 54:48.920
we're trying to make something that emulates Game of Thrones.

54:49.400 --> 54:53.200
And because. In medieval Europe,

54:53.200 --> 54:56.440
it was pretty white, we kept our game pretty white.

54:56.880 --> 55:00.960
And of course, a lot of people, a lot of people, a lot of people.

55:01.960 --> 55:04.440
Are correct to quickly point out a few things.

55:04.960 --> 55:09.640
Number one, there actually was diversity in medieval Europe.

55:10.280 --> 55:15.360
There were quite a few persons of many colors.

55:16.560 --> 55:21.640
In fact, a few even were nobles.

55:24.040 --> 55:27.360
And yeah, Dark Tetsuya says,

55:27.360 --> 55:30.160
I know Square Enix has been struggling with this for years.

55:30.160 --> 55:34.040
I mean, in 16 games, there's been what, three POC that I can think of?

55:34.920 --> 55:37.280
Yeah, hold that thought for a minute,

55:37.280 --> 55:39.520
because I'm going to come back to that in a minute.

55:39.520 --> 55:44.080
But yeah, obviously there's that, that, you know,

55:44.080 --> 55:47.320
yes, there actually were diverse people in medieval Europe.

55:48.040 --> 55:52.400
Number two, I guess, though, if you were to go to Game of Thrones,

55:52.640 --> 55:56.280
which this game is clearly trying to emulate, while yes,

55:56.280 --> 56:01.160
there were characters of color in Game of Thrones,

56:01.760 --> 56:05.920
they many would argue they were not really main characters

56:05.920 --> 56:08.440
that were utilized as well as they could have been.

56:09.360 --> 56:12.200
So perhaps if that goal is to emulate Game of Thrones,

56:12.200 --> 56:14.640
then that's a little more what they're doing.

56:14.640 --> 56:16.680
But also, it should be pointed out.

56:16.680 --> 56:21.400
And many people, again, are pointing out your game is Final Fantasy.

56:22.680 --> 56:27.280
Fantasy, why are you so hell bent on rooting it in reality?

56:27.280 --> 56:30.120
You can't say your game is rooted in reality

56:30.400 --> 56:33.720
while you're showing off a trailer of ice lady

56:33.720 --> 56:37.160
throwing icicles at giant rock man fighting.

56:37.160 --> 56:39.480
I mean, hello.

56:39.480 --> 56:43.640
And you ride giant chickens, so I mean, come on. Yeah.

56:44.960 --> 56:49.880
So obviously there are some problems with what Yoshi P said this week.

56:51.040 --> 56:53.360
Now, before I come back for some other comments,

56:53.600 --> 56:56.520
I want to go to another story involving Square Enix.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.080
I think some of this may have been from last week.

57:01.080 --> 57:04.920
I'm going to say it anyway, because the the side I'm looking at here,

57:04.920 --> 57:08.840
VG charts just published it six days ago anyway.

57:08.840 --> 57:11.200
So it's it's from this week.

57:11.200 --> 57:13.480
Square Enix president and director

57:13.480 --> 57:18.240
Yosuke Matsuda in the 2022 annual report for Square Enix says

57:18.640 --> 57:21.040
it is difficult to achieve growth for companies

57:21.040 --> 57:23.560
that primarily focus on the Japanese gaming industry.

57:23.760 --> 57:26.320
And it is important for Square Enix to offer games

57:26.320 --> 57:29.600
that will be popular worldwide in a quote.

57:30.360 --> 57:33.760
Director Yasuke Matsuda said, achieving major growth in the game

57:33.760 --> 57:36.480
industry is difficult now for companies that compete

57:36.680 --> 57:40.960
primarily in the Japanese market, given its graying demographics.

57:41.320 --> 57:45.000
As such, it is critical for our business that we produce hit titles

57:45.160 --> 57:48.240
that speak to the global market, which offers greater scale

57:48.240 --> 57:50.520
in terms of both customers and sales volumes.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.960
Furthermore, game development efforts are becoming more sizable

57:53.960 --> 57:56.920
and sophisticated as the result of technological advancements

57:56.920 --> 58:00.560
in the devices on which they are played, such as consoles or smart devices.

58:00.880 --> 58:03.600
The investment required to develop game titles is therefore

58:03.640 --> 58:06.160
an order of magnitude greater than in the past.

58:06.760 --> 58:10.000
In other words, the Japanese market is no longer sufficient

58:10.200 --> 58:13.560
for achieving a level of earnings that enables us to recoup

58:13.760 --> 58:16.040
our development investment and generate a profit.

58:16.200 --> 58:18.600
And we therefore need to approach our development efforts

58:18.760 --> 58:22.000
based on the assumption that we have to succeed in the global market.

58:24.160 --> 58:24.800
Mr.

58:26.160 --> 58:29.200
Yosuke Matsudasan.

58:29.200 --> 58:32.640
The answer is right in front of you.

58:33.600 --> 58:40.800
Because I would say, while Yoshi P made a bad statement this week.

58:42.800 --> 58:46.200
There's a lot of people on Twitter doing what Twitter usually and I'm

58:46.200 --> 58:48.680
not even going to walk into the garbage fire of what a lot of

58:48.680 --> 58:50.960
Twitter is this week, I'm just going to talk social media in general.

58:51.560 --> 58:56.080
There's a lot of people ready to cancel Yoshi P for what he said.

58:57.400 --> 59:01.040
And while I'm sure I think Yoshi P should be accountable for what he said,

59:01.680 --> 59:09.320
I think canceling him is extremely, extremely short-sighted of the real problem.

59:13.560 --> 59:14.440
And what am I getting at?

59:15.360 --> 59:21.000
The real problem is a lot of Japanese studios don't get it.

59:22.040 --> 59:29.640
Because Japan hasn't had a lot of the same discussions in their country

59:30.000 --> 59:31.400
that we've had in this country.

59:33.280 --> 59:40.440
There's quite a bit of, for lack of a better description, it's, it's

59:42.520 --> 59:47.280
unaware racism, like they still have people who perform in blackface.

59:48.400 --> 59:52.240
They, they have all kinds of appropriative action.

59:52.240 --> 59:55.840
But then again, I mean, you look societally, like most of the society

59:55.840 --> 59:58.920
there was appropriated from other places at its formation.

59:59.440 --> 01:00:04.680
But, um, but, but going back to it, it's, it's a cultural issue.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.960
It's, it's something that has to be seen through a more complex lens.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.680
And with any cultural issue and including our own issues here with,

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.320
with racism and bigotry, you have to dismantle the foundation.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:16.800
Yep.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:24.360
You know, so it's ridiculous, but it's where you have to start.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:24.880
Yeah.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:29.360
But the reason why I brought up what, you know, Yasuke Masuda said was

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.520
because in my view, these things are very closely aligned is that he's

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.640
sitting here saying, how do we succeed in a global market?

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.040
And then a statement like this comes out of his company this week.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.440
That's the answer.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.560
Start there.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.520
Because if Japan wants to, Japanese developers want to succeed in the

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:57.680
global market, then they also need to open up to this because let's be real.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.120
This is not just an issue of Final Fantasy 16.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.600
Did y'all not look at the cast of Final Fantasy 15?

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:09.560
This isn't an issue just dedicated to the Final Fantasy series.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.040
Y'all ever played Genshin Impact?

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.720
Fantasy 6 had more diversity.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.880
So there's a lot, and I'm not going to say every Japanese developer does this

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.480
because you all will name games that have done better diversity and so forth.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:30.280
And Rama, if you want to call in now, I'll take your call now.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:37.880
But this is something that Japan, you know, Japanese developers need

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.560
to address on a wider scale.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.280
Some other comments in chat here.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.920
Tiger Cloud Chat says, if it's emulating Game of Thrones, this means they also

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.720
have to emulate the sex that is associated with it.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.720
I guess a fair point as to, you know, leaving some things out or what have you.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:00.400
So, which child's getting thrown out the window or into the, into the fire.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.960
Was that Game of Thrones or was that another show?

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.120
That gif of the baby getting thrown in the fire.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:04.920
Was that Game of Thrones?

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:05.880
I don't know.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.360
Anyway, uh, let's see other comments from chat.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.040
Um, it's fine though.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.880
Cause that child that, you know, fell out the window, you know, he'll become king

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.720
someday, so it's fine.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.120
Yeah.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:22.240
Anyway, I want to bring Rama, I want to let Rama have a say on this as well.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.880
Uh, so I'm going to go to discord where I believe Rama called in.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.600
Hey, what's going on y'all?

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.680
Hey, not much, but we are talking about an issue.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.840
Um, and you know, it does have to do with the representation of, uh, black

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.440
individuals in video games.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.000
I'm not black Rama.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:41.920
None of us are.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.160
But I will say this.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.400
You are gay as the day is long.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.880
And even still Japan still has a slight issue with that.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.360
Oh yeah.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:50.760
Oh yeah.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.280
I'm aware.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:51.760
I'm aware.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:52.640
Tell it.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.600
And for the record, before I begin, I just want you to know, I'm just sitting

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.560
here, putting my laundry away.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.160
I'm like, I got words to say, and then you go, feel free to call in.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.320
I'm just like, God damn it.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.280
I don't even have a shirt on.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.760
I'm running around throwing a shirt on so I can be semi decent for y'all

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.480
because I love all of y'all.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.760
You can, he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to make another

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.280
leaked pic of that one game.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.760
So yeah, you don't want to have an overdose or problem here.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.400
Uh, you can always not be on cam.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:20.800
It's fine.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.560
I know I, I kinda, but, but you know, your, your perspective for

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.160
many reasons is important.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:30.680
I also, you know, because you have, you do anime jam session, I know you're

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.560
very familiar with Japanese culture.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.560
That's, that's very much a reason.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.160
I'd like to hear your take on this topic.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.920
I will say this.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.240
I have heard from people, you know, who have gone to Japan and talk about,

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.960
oh, how in Japan, they kind of treat black people differently.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:51.040
I'm like, you can be white as bread and they will still treat you differently.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:58.040
A lot of the issues I hear in anime fandom is that Japan does not include

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:02.560
us in anime unless it's like a stereotype character and so forth.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.840
Oddly enough, when it comes to video games, there were some rumblings

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:12.040
with Barrett Wallace, Saz, and Shadow the Hedgehog.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:20.400
So, personally, I'm, I didn't have an issue with it, but it's what

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.160
they go off of and what is known.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:30.320
Now, there are some people who have started their own anime studios in Japan.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.520
They're like, you know what, if we can't get them to do what we want, I'm

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.960
going to make something for all of us.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.360
Sometimes it works.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.600
Sometimes it does not.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:43.360
Part of the issue is Japan is seen as a xenophobic country.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.920
Also, Japan only does, when it comes to manga, anime, video games, they

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:54.560
only go by what they know and they will pull from various texts

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.840
from history and just roll with it.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.360
Personally, I just don't have an issue with it because I don't go down that

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:08.280
far down the rabbit hole, because if I did, I'd probably be talking

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.240
with y'all about this while we're in a kufi and a dashiki.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.480
But you mentioned in chat, you don't really have an interest

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.040
in Fam SE 16 at this point until it's in the bargain bin.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:20.720
Exactly.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.080
I, as you know, I don't fully believe in cancel culture.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.640
I believe people, they may mess up.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:32.160
They should be allowed a chance at redemption, but that redemption

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.240
should fall on them, not do it because people want them to do it.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:38.360
Sorry.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.360
And I don't mean to interrupt, but I think it's important to state

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.760
and to set like expectations or whatever appropriately.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.240
Final Fantasy 16 is not suddenly going to get a black character in it.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.680
Like they're, they're pushing that game for summer of 2023.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.920
That's, that's not going to happen at this point.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.800
Like just, I, I, I'm not saying that's the right, I'm just saying

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.040
that's the realist thing, you know, especially when you hear these

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.920
comments about Square Enix is struggling a little bit, they're not

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.480
delaying this game for this.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.880
So the game is coming out.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.360
Maybe there is DLC.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:12.400
I don't know, but I think this is something Square Enix needs to address

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.640
moving forward with future games than trying to necessarily fix this one.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.240
I mean, you could make one of the main characters black in FF16

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.520
by doing a palette swap.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.840
Some people will be happy about that.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.840
Others will be, and you're into the crap.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.080
Yeah.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.320
Some people will take issue with that too.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.800
You know what, you know, it's worth bringing up, I don't know, but, um, I do

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:40.960
know that we don't know who the voice actors are yet, you may have somebody

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:46.640
black that is actually voicing a white character that was done in Final Fantasy

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:54.120
14, um, because there was an actress that played Yuri, um, who Yuri was,

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:58.080
you know, it's, it's, it's our rod, but fair skin, basically it was in the

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:01.440
Stormblood, I remember that because unfortunately the voice actors passed

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.320
away and I remember talking about that on the show and she passed away.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:08.560
But I remember like that she was a person of color and was playing,

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.520
you know, uh, Yuri in a Final Fantasy 14.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.680
So, but I, at the same time, I'm just, I'm just saying that is

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.160
something that they might be doing.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.000
Ashley's voice actor, Mass Effect.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:19.480
Yeah.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:19.880
Oh yeah.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.240
There's, and you know, we've seen, we've seen some of that, but it

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.800
doesn't really address the issue.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.040
I'm just saying it might be something you find out.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:30.760
Helps like earlier, like last week, there was controversy about the anime

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:36.040
bleach, the voice actor for Chad Jamison price stepped down and said, I am

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:40.320
opening this roll up for people of color to do, you know, it's something

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.400
that nobody asked him to do it.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.320
He just felt it was the right thing to do.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.760
And there was a person of color as the new voice of Chad.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:52.120
Black, black Facebook is like half is split down the middle.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.040
They're like, no, this is woke propaganda.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:55.840
Stop pandering.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.240
The other half, I think this is kind of cool.

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:01.960
Me personally, I thought the dub was cool.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.080
I didn't know Jamison price was a white dude.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.760
I thought he did a great job.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.720
I don't think he should have stepped down cause nobody

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:09.920
asked him to do a complaint.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.720
But if this is what he's doing to open up roles for people of color,

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.280
to get further into the, into voice acting.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.520
So be it, if it sounds good, it sounds good as a voice of

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.480
Jack is roll with the punches.

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:29.400
You know, I will say, if nothing else, Yoshi P has shown at least

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.720
here's the thing, Yoshi P, not a great look on this, but his track

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.960
record is pretty good when it comes to being educated by his fan base.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.320
And I think you've seen that in final fantasy 14.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.120
Um, for example, the same sex marriage, or they call it the bonding

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.120
ceremonies or whatever they call it in that he listened to the

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.120
feedback and the team implemented that.

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:56.080
Um, when they announced that Viera would be limited to female forms

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.080
only, and you know, that many voices, including me rose up and said,

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.120
why not have why I thought you said you weren't doing gender lock

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:03.920
characters anymore.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.960
Why are you locking characters to certain gender?

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.640
And they reverse that and they put male VR.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.880
I mean, we had to wait an expansion for it, but they put male

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.320
VR in the game eventually.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.040
Um, and there's other things too.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.880
And you might remember when all of those issues with, um, end

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.440
Walker's launch happened.

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:26.440
Yoshi P said something I never hear CEO say, and that was, I'm sorry.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.920
So, you know, again, there's a lot, a lot can happen in the next few

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:35.200
days, you know, Yoshi P has got to take some time to listen to this

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.320
feedback and think carefully about the response.

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.840
Although I really think the response needs to come from Matsuda about

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.920
what they're going to do at square Enix's level to address this.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.800
And yes, I know they, I know they have games like four spoken, but

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.720
that isn't really addressing the problem because final fantasy is

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.960
a long running franchise with a diversity problem.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:09:59.920
Right.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.960
I will say this before I get up on out of here.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:06.240
You know who Yoshi P needs to talk to about this?

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:13.120
Harada from Tekken, two words, Leroy Smith.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:14.080
That's it.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:19.960
People asked Harada on Twitter about this character, and he just went on

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:24.080
into this long, interesting diatribe about diversity within the Tekken

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.960
games and fandom, black Twitter gave him an automatic pass to the cookout.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.600
I think there's a lot of developers in Japan right now who might need to listen.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:37.600
Yeah.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.200
A lot.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:43.440
That's why a lot of people of color are going to Japan, not just make

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.040
their goals and dreams come true, but to be heard and be spoken and hoping

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.920
that they work on a project or whatever.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:55.360
And what happens is they can be a part of it and be more involved when it

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.600
comes to people like me, you know?

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:04.640
Well, I love a new final fantasy game, you know, medieval setting character like me.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:10.080
We need somebody fabulous as you Rob, you know, we need an awesome spitfire

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:14.080
like Jamie, you know, and we need an awesome badass like Loki.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.080
The Tsunteri is already a thing, so.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.280
We are a party of four.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.280
I can't call you a Tsunteri, that's an understatement.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.240
We are a party of four right now.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:29.440
So quick, which final fantasy class are you in the party right here, right now?

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.840
We are the warriors of light.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.600
Which class are you?

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.600
Really, Rob?

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.600
Really?

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.600
Black Mage.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.600
Come on now.

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.600
It is not just because of that.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.600
If you remember, it's not just that.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:48.600
If you remember the webcomic nuclear power 8-bit theater, put us all together.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.600
I'll be snarky as that Black Mage.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:52.600
Believe you me.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.600
Bard for me.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.600
See, I would have to go snarky as that Black Mage.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.600
See, I would have to go, since I'm playing through Final Fantasy 5 right now,

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:09.600
my most versatile character is Lena, who I have as a Red Mage with X magic.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.600
So I cast double spells.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.600
It's pretty useful.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.600
All right, Loki, you're all that's left.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.600
You're going to have to go warrior.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.600
We need a tank.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.600
We need to be our black belt.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.600
No, what do you want to be?

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.600
You don't have to do it.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.600
What do you want to be?

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.600
I was Red Mage before in 11, so I would do Red Mage again.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.600
Okay.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.600
There you go.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.600
All right.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.600
I think like when I'm in 14.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.600
Red Mage, Black Mage in 11.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.600
I think in 14, I was doing a summoner.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.600
So maybe summoner.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.600
We're going to be a Bard and three mages.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.600
We are going to get our fucking ass kicked by Chaos, but we'll have fun in the process.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.600
Red mages have very good defense.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.600
That's true.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:56.600
And I'm doing the Final Fantasy 5 version, so I can actually, instead of having double cast,

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.600
I can do equip shields.

01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:59.600
There you go.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:00.600
There you go.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.600
All right.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:07.600
Rama, thank you for calling in and thank you for putting a shirt on and calling in and

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.600
giving us your take on this.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.600
Really value your insight and so forth.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.600
And I invite all of the listeners, if they have something to say on this.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.600
I really would love to hear from everybody on this.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:20.600
Participate at orangelandtrady.com is the place to send an email, or you can tweet us,

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:25.600
of course, throughout the week at OLR for at least a few more days until Twitter completely

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:26.600
collapses.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.600
So thank you, Rama.

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.600
An anime jam session.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.600
Everyone check that out Tuesday nights or on the podcast feed.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.600
9 p.m. Eastern.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.600
Come through.

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.600
We'll have cookies.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.600
All right.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.600
Will do.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.600
Awesome.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:43.600
All right.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.600
Thanks, Rama.

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.600
Appreciate you.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.600
No problem.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.600
You take care, y'all.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.600
All right.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.600
Bye.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.600
Bye.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.600
All right.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.600
Let's move on to our next story.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:14:01.600
Well, you know, it was going to happen one day or another, but Lionsgate, which has produced

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:09.600
the John Wick franchise, is in talks to do a major video game from it.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:13.600
I mean, there's not much details, but I would reckon it would be some sort of runaround

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:19.600
and shoot the bad guy and get revenge for your dog sort of thing.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:25.600
Or it could be like some in-depth like Assassin's Creed style thing, you know, going by like

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.600
the later movies or something.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.600
I don't know.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.600
But but at any rate, it's it's in talks.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.600
I don't have much more about that.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.600
Just it's floating.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:44.600
It needs to be like the TMNT arcade game with full 90s effects still in.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.600
Exactly.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.600
It's the only way that makes sense for me is just like, you know, you just have constant

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.600
like streams of bad guys coming in kind of like the movie.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.600
Yeah, I play it.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.600
Loki, what do you have for us?

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.600
All right.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:01.600
Well, old things becoming new again.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.600
So the Oregon Trail is coming to the switch on November 14th.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.600
So that's in like a week here.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:15.600
And yeah, apparently this is a project by Gameloft and Harper Collins.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.600
And it looks like kind of a remake, I guess, of the game.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.600
I'm not sure if this has been out on other platforms.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.600
I assume probably has.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:28.600
But yeah, now they're going to be bringing it to the switch so we can all die of dysentery

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.600
together.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.600
Oh, yeah, of course.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.600
Right here.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.600
It says it's on Steam and on the Microsoft shop.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.600
So I'm assuming Xbox as well.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.600
Neat.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.600
Yeah.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.600
Check that out.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.600
Dark to see in chat says, I think it's an Apple arcade port.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:47.600
And yeah, Jason, our voiceover guy kind of referenced that in the intro tonight, too.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.600
It seems like it is a cool.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.600
Yeah, it's a port of what was on Apple Arcade a little while ago.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:59.600
So yeah, it'll be, you know, it's literally a game that defined a generation.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:04.600
So as long as I can go ham on like, oh, yes, I can on wildlife.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.600
That's awesome.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.600
Absolutely.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.600
I would hope so.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.600
All right.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:16.600
Well, going to our next story, let's talk about finally a premiere date for the HBO

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.600
Last of Us series, which I know a lot of people are looking forward to.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.600
January 15th is the day.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.600
So you don't always see premieres in January, but that's pretty fun.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:32.600
The Last of Us TV series will be on HBO and HBO Max January 15th at 9 p.m.

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.600
Eastern.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.600
Does that does that conflict with our show?

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.600
Did they pick a Sunday?

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.600
They sure did, didn't they?

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.600
Yes, they did.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:41.600
That is a Sunday.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.600
Assholes.

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.600
All right.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.600
Well, you have to tape it or watch it on HBO Max after the fact.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:52.600
Do you love how I still say you got to tape it as if anybody actually uses VHS to record

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.600
things anyway?

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.600
Does anyone still use VHS to record shows?

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:00.600
But anyway, you got to you got to watch that on demand later because we'll be live.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.600
But I guess if you listen to us on the podcast feed, then that works, too.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:06.600
So you got to do one live and do the other later.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:10.600
So there's going to be 10 episodes in the initial season.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:14.600
Of course, you are probably already aware, but The Last of Us has Pedro Pascal starring

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:20.600
as Joe and Bella Ramsey from Game of Thrones is starring as Ellie in the game.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:24.600
And there are some other big names in the series, like Nick Offerman, Gabriel Luna,

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.600
Anna Torv are also in it.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.600
Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, voice actors from the game, will also be making appearances

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.600
in the series.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.600
The show is expected to follow the plot of the game.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.600
So, you know, not to deviate too much from that, but we'll see.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.600
Who knows?

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:48.600
Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann does serve as writer and executive producer from Chernobyl.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.600
Craig Mazin is also helping out with that.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:57.600
The Last of Us will have creative input from the developer and acclaimed talent behind

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.600
the cameras.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:04.600
So it's not just like taking an IP and turning it over to people that are familiar with movies.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.600
They're working a lot more in tandem.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:09.600
So it'll be very interesting to see what happens with that.

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.600
Oh, interesting.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:15.600
Rama in chat says, yes, a bunch of fans in Japan broke out their Betamax machines to

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.600
record the reboot of Urusei Yatsura.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.600
I'll send you the link later.

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.600
Wow.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:26.600
Eshun Hanomat says, does anyone remember the last thing they recorded via VHS?

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.600
Yes, I do.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:34.600
My parents had a DVD player, but I was in college at the time and I wasn't fancy enough

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.600
for a DVD player.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:43.600
So I would take the DVDs and I would transfer because our VHS machine had RCA, the red,

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.600
yellow, white plugs on the front.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:49.600
So you could plug the DVD machine into the VCR and record off the DVD machine.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.600
So I recorded DVDs.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:57.600
The last thing I recorded off of VHS was from TV.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.600
And it was when we did the Guitar Hero thing.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.600
Oh, from the news.

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.600
Yeah.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.600
Yep.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:08.600
I was gonna say the last movie I remember transferring from DVD to VHS like that was

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:14.600
Cruel Intentions, which the quintessential 90s film, to be quite honest.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:17.600
I don't remember anything.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.600
From that movie or from VHS's?

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.600
At all.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.600
Oh, at all.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.600
I don't remember the last three decades.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.600
Sorry.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.600
That's okay.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.600
Let's see.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.600
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the last thing I recorded on a VHS was a TV special that

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.600
I was in early on in my NFL drumline career.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:38.600
There was a special about the lottery halftime show that we were in and they recorded a segment

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.600
with us.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:44.600
Prince Peach Fuzz says, word of advice, don't watch any VHS tapes with no labels that are

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.600
found underneath your parents bed.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.600
All right.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:20:00.600
Don't go to a cabin in the resort areas of Japan and play any VHS tape that happens to

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.600
be still in the VCR when you get there.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:03.600
Yes.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.600
I was gonna say if a friend hands you a tape and says you need to watch it within seven

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.600
days, don't do it.

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.600
All right.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:15.600
Let's get to our next segment, which obviously we're gonna get into the classic game of the

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.600
week, but I wanted to say before we do that, and obviously it's a little different this

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:22.600
week because once a month Dark Sakura mixes it up, but you might've noticed last week

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:27.600
and this week, even though she's here, she's done a prerecorded segment for us because

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.600
I believe it's a little easier on your voice to do this all in a prerecorded segment and

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.600
you can make little movies to go with it.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:41.600
We are looking at ways for the podcast folks of putting these movies on social media like

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.600
YouTube or something like that.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:46.600
I don't know if we'll do YouTube or TikTok, but one of those places where you can then

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:49.600
watch these later on if you want throughout the week.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.600
So we are looking into that.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.600
I hope to have more to announce on that when we get back.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.600
So I just wanted to get that out there.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:58.600
But in the meantime, let's get to the segment, shall we?

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:13.600
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:16.600
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:20.600
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:29.600
Today's classic electronic game is a series of gaming watches released by Nelsonic starting

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.600
in the late 1970s through the 1990s.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:40.600
Nelsonic, while being known for higher end watches currently, was well known for pop

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.600
culture themed wrist watches for children and young adults.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:51.600
Their early watches had LCD screens with basic functions like the time, duh, and an alarm

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.600
clock.

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:58.600
The company was inspired by other specialty watches like calculator watches and even cigarette

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:01.600
lighter watches to make gaming watches.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.600
And so they did.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:10.600
They obtained licenses from Sega, Nintendo, Midway, Milton Bradley, and others for games

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:15.600
and even had licenses for standard watches from franchises like Barbie, G.I.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:22.600
Joe, Power Rangers, and Ghostbusters released as the real Ghostbusters to name a few.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:27.600
The company was also a distributor for the Game & Watch series.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:34.600
Among notable games are Simon, the Milton Bradley game, Space Attacker that was for

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:40.600
some releases as Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan, The Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, Frogger,

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:46.600
several Mario games, Legend of Zelda, Tetris, and a few others.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:50.600
In fact, two of their games were notable firsts.

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:56.600
Luigi's Hammer Toss was the first game to feature only Luigi as a playable character,

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.600
Princess Toadstool's Castle Run was her first as well.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:05.600
Star Fox had two different layout releases and one of them included a headphone jack

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:06.600
and headphones.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:12.600
Some of these games were also released in Japan at McDonald's including the Luigi's

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.600
Hammer Toss and the Princess Toadstool's Castle Run.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:23.600
The last two releases from Nelsonic came out in 1997 with the last actual game being Dinky

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:24.600
Dino's Watch.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:31.600
It was a Tamagotchi style digital pet that you could raise and take care of.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:38.600
The other one was a standard licensed watch themed around Poochie, a pink and white canine

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.600
marketing sensation from the late 80s through the 90s.

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.600
I had a couple of Poochie dolls, I will admit to it.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.600
These days, the watches can actually fetch.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:58.600
Right now on eBay, they're ranging anywhere from about $45 to well over $500, close to

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.600
$600 in and out of its packaging.

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:09.600
One of them is a working mint-in-box Legend of Zelda, which is presently up to about $300.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:15.600
And then the most expensive one that I saw was a U.S. Princess Toadstool's Castle Run

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.600
still in its packaging.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:22.600
So, a few of my friends had these.

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:28.600
I did not, because honestly I couldn't stand wearing a watch.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:37.600
But my friends would play these in class, try to sneak with getting the game in.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:42.600
Of course, my other friends were busy programming their graphing calculators to play a whole

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.600
position, for example.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.600
But I digress.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:50.600
These were pretty much everywhere, all the cool kids at them.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:56.600
And I mean, I don't recall them being supremely expensive when they came out.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.600
They were very novel sort of things.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:08.600
And definitely just looking at them evokes this nostalgia for me, so I'm here for it.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:15.600
If any of you still have a working one, I would love to know in our mailbox at participate

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:18.600
at orangeloundradio.com.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:25.600
At any rate, this was the Classic Electronic Game, or Pentultimate Entry.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:31.600
Stay tuned for next month's Ultimate Entry.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.600
Alright, there it is.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.600
The Classic Electronic Handheld of the Month.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.600
I was never cool enough to have one of those, sadly.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.600
I remember them, though.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.600
My friend had that Tetris one.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.600
But yeah, they were pretty cool.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:49.600
Looking in some of the comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vlog network, Robot Giggles,

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.600
first time chatter, hi, welcome to OLR, says, I want one.

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.600
Yeah, that would be a fun retro thing to collect.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.600
Even just those special boxes.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.600
In the video, you kind of show the boxes.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.600
They are so expensive.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:02.600
I know, I know.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:10.600
Like, even one of those Luigi watches out of the package was like 200 bones.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:11.600
Yeah.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:12.600
Yes.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:15.600
You'll have to, the only way you're going to find one is to get like a garage sale or

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.600
someplace that doesn't know the value of what those things are really worth, which, you

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:22.600
know, is, you know, shady, but it is what it is.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:26.600
Didi Archaholic, Hello Hello says, I have never seen or heard of these watches before.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.600
That must have come out long after I was in school.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.600
When were these popular?

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.600
I remember them when I was in school.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:32.600
Yeah.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:33.600
Oh.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.600
Yeah.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.600
Yeah.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.600
All right.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:37.600
Great pick.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.600
S2100 Matt says, I think I had a Double Dragon one, but that was Tiger Electronics.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.600
Well, I'm sure once, you know.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.600
These weren't Tiger.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.600
Yeah.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.600
Once, you know, these are out, then the other gaming franchises want to have their versions

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:50.600
of that and all that good stuff.

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.600
So I'm sure there were plenty of, I would say knockoffs, but clones we'll say.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:59.600
I'm not even going to say either of that because graphing, not graphing, but calculator watches

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.600
have been around since the seventies.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:08.600
And even before that, they had like, like I was showing the pocket watch, a lighter

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:14.600
and actually even today they have watches that have, that are USB charged that have

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.600
a lighter built into them.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:25.600
You know, the, the concept of putting things in a watch and carrying it with you is, is

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.600
not a really new concept.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.600
I mean, hello, I've got my, my Apple watch on.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.600
Never thought I would want a smartwatch until I used one.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.600
And then I was like, Oh, this is for me, game changing.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.600
Like just the whole like workout heart rate measuring.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.600
And now the, now I get, now I get.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:44.600
Call detection.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:45.600
Too damn loud.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.600
Yeah.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.600
All this stuff.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.600
I'm just like, I love it.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.600
So, and of course the necessary pictures of my kitties that I can look at all the time

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.600
on the background.

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.600
So there's that too.

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.600
I just use the modular ones that I don't forget when crap is.

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:05.600
And I know how hot it is, which is not a Prince Peach fuzz is asking doom on a watch.

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.600
Not yet.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.600
Not yet.

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:08.600
But you probably do it though.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.600
Yeah, probably.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:10.600
I'm sure it's possible.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.600
Oh, come on.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:19.600
I, I, on one of like an old, like black and white Mac, I had four disc doom installed

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.600
on one of those in the lab at school.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.600
So I could play it instead of paying attention.

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:24.600
I love that.

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:25.600
All right.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.600
So let's travel around the industry and check out some other headlines in a segment.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.600
We call rapid fire news.

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:32.600
Uh, let's start with Loki.

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:33.600
Yep.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:39.600
So there's, um, a little bit more of an announcement from EA talking about their partnership with,

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:42.600
um, Marvel.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.600
So they're going to be doing some Marvel games, including there's, I think three in the works

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.600
right now.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.600
Uh, one of these is going to be an Ironman game.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:56.600
Um, um, they're saying that, you know, the other ones right now, we don't really know

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.600
what those are going to be yet.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:04.600
Um, and this is outside of the, you know, midnight suns game that's coming up from fire

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.600
access.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.600
And then that captain America, black Panther game, uh, that was supposed to be, I think

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:10.600
coming out as well.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.600
I don't remember which studio is working on that.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:18.600
Um, so yeah, there was also supposed to be another black Panther game, I think at EA

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.600
as well.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:27.600
So I guess we'll find out, you know, maybe game awards, maybe next E3.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:30.600
I don't know.

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:34.600
Um, anyways, this is, uh, interesting, I guess.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.600
Um, so you know, that whole Gran Turismo movie that's supposed to be coming out.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:43.600
Well, apparently now, uh, Jerry Holloway Horner is joining the cast as well.

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:48.600
So do you mean the ginger spice ginger spice?

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.600
This is going to be the Gran Turismo movie.

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.600
By the way, is everyone ready to feel old?

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.600
Is everyone ready to feel old?

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:59.600
Spice World just had its 25th anniversary album released.

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.600
Spice World is 25 years old.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.600
That's their second album.

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:03.600
Right?

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:04.600
What?

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.600
I feel old every time I get out of bed.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.600
Yeah.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.600
My body reminds me I'm old every day.

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.600
Okay.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.600
Tangent time.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:14.600
Choo choo trains pulled up to the station.

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:15.600
Here we go.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.600
Tangent train.

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:19.600
Let's talk about feeling old for a minute.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:27.600
Yesterday, I went, um, into San Francisco to see the touring production of Jagged Little Pill, which was on Broadway a few years ago.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:32.600
I think it was, uh, I want to say Grammy nominated, Tony nominated or whatever they call those awards.

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:43.600
So long story short, I had went out to Broadway, New York City in 2019 before the pandemic to see, uh, Jagged Little Pill on Broadway.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:48.600
Um, and I went with my friend, Melanie, um, one of the Mel's.

01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:52.600
Uh, so we went out in Broadway and we saw the show there.

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:59.600
Three years later, almost to the day yesterday, we went and saw it in San Francisco together again.

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.600
So we got to see the show three years apart.

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:04.600
And there were actually things I liked about the touring production better.

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:07.600
One of them was the seats, but that's, that's neither here nor there.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:15.600
Um, my point is we decided it would be cute to get pictures in front of the marquee three years apart.

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:20.600
Hilariously, because it was fucking cold in New York, I was wearing the, uh, a hoodie.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:25.600
And because it was cold in San Francisco yesterday and rainy, I was wearing the exact same hoodie.

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:28.600
In fact, it's this it's actually behind me here.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.600
Oh shit, it's way over there on the couch.

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:34.600
I can't grab it easily, but it's, it's an Atari hoodie that I had imported.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:41.600
Anybody that's seen a selfie, I love that fucking hoodie because it has like the actual like wood grain on it.

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.600
Um, it's, it's a beautiful hoodie.

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.600
I'll grab it when somebody else is doing a show, a story and put it on cam.

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:51.600
But, um, my point with all that is I could see two things.

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.600
One, I could see the weight loss in my face.

01:31:54.600 --> 01:32:00.600
You know, I don't always notice that in selfies of me, but I was like, Oh fuck, my face is like a lot thinner than it was three years ago.

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:01.600
But number two.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:02.600
Happens.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:11.600
And number two, to the point of this whole tangent train, there is so much more gray in my beard now than there was three years ago.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:16.600
It has been a long pandemic.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:17.600
You know what I found?

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.600
What?

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.600
The picture when you took me to the hospital for my surgery.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.600
Oh my gosh.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:29.600
Yeah, we, we, we look a bit different now.

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.600
Yeah, absolutely.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:32.600
All right.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:36.600
That's just, that's just really, really fun.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:37.600
Yeah.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:41.600
This is interesting to see like a very similar picture, even if it's in like two very different towns.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:45.600
It's very similar to see that, um, like three years apart.

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:49.600
Uh, I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:56.600
Uh, when I brought up spice spice world, uh, Jessiks and chat says, I'm ashamed to say I saw the spice girls movie in the theater.

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:57.600
Don't be ashamed.

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.600
Don't be ashamed.

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.600
I had the best time.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.600
That movie came out when I was in college.

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.600
So I can't even say I was a kid and I made my parents take me.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:06.600
That movie came out when I was in college.

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:09.600
It's one of those movies that's like so cheesy, bad.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:10.600
It's kind of good.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.600
It has meatloaf in it.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:13.600
It does have meatloaf in it.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.600
It has Richard O'Brien in it.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:20.600
It has that scene where they, they have the bus jumping and they, they do the, anyway.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:21.600
Wasn't Rowan Atkinson in it?

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:25.600
I think all the, and, um, absolutely fabulous.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.600
Had a cameo too.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.600
Like all the big British pop culture stuff was in it and you know, and it's, it's, it's,

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:32.600
it's the spice world movie is still quotable.

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.600
What should I wear?

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:39.600
The little Gucci dress, the little Gucci dress or the little Gucci dress.

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:44.600
Anyway, I promise never to quote that movie again on this show.

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:45.600
No, I'm going to break that promise.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.600
We all know it.

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:47.600
All right.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.600
Uh, moving on what we had more rapid fire.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:57.600
So like for spice girls stuff though, I still use, I use the story of the, the, uh, union

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.600
flag dress.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.600
For me, customizing my own clothes.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:06.600
I was like, if ginger spice can do it with the tea towel and a dress, I can do it.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:11.600
I wanted to see that dress so bad when I was at the hard rock in Vegas before they bulldozed

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:12.600
it.

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:13.600
It's gone now.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:19.600
Um, because I'd seen it there in the year, in the year 2000, literally the first, the

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.600
same trip where I was, I played dance, dance revolution for the first time.

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:25.600
I saw that dress and I tried to go find it when we were there a few years ago.

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.600
Again, another melody story.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:28.600
Um, couldn't find it.

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.600
They moved it.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.600
It was gone.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.600
And now they've bulldozed the whole damn hotel.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:35.600
So I don't know where that dress is now, but I want to go see it again.

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.600
It's like, it's like a movie.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:39.600
I want to go see that dress again.

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:41.600
It is.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:42.600
It's yeah.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:43.600
It's a thing.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.600
I have one last anecdote.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.600
Yes, please.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.600
Dan sent me a trailer for a Broadway show.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:54.600
That's back to the future of the musical is playing at the winter garden theater.

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:55.600
Oh, is that what they're replacing?

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.600
Beetlejuice with?

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:57.600
It must be.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.600
Cause I think Beetlejuice is in winter garden right now.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:02.600
And the thing is, is that I really want to see it because the one and only time I've

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.600
been to a Broadway show was in the winter garden theater.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.600
And I saw cats, cats.

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:11.600
Did you not hear me sing along with the entire, I know you sang along the entire, you defended

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.600
that movie when no one else would.

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.600
And I still love it.

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:15.600
I know.

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:20.600
I know you, uh, uh, uh, winter garden was where a mamma mia played for a long time too.

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:21.600
And Rocky.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:22.600
Yeah.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:23.600
So, yeah.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.600
But, but, but I think cats was like its longest running.

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:27.600
Oh, I'm sure.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.600
Show.

01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.600
I think it was like 19 years.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.600
Yeah.

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:32.600
Yeah.

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:33.600
Yeah.

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:34.600
I was looking about going back to Broadway and seeing some stuff, but there's not, there's

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.600
not a lot of shows where I'm like, Ooh, I have to see that.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:40.600
I still feel like Broadway is still trying to recover from everything that happened.

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:43.600
It's going to take a few more months for them to get their group back.

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.600
So, um, I mean, I'm not going to pay to see Lea Michele and funny girl.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.600
I'm not.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:52.600
Whenever there's a cat's revival, I definitely want to go, but I'm, you know,

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:57.600
when I went like Tommy was playing and I could have seen that, but I picked cats.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:58.600
All right.

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.600
Anyway, we should probably go back to video games.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.600
What do you have for us?

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:09.600
Um, well, uh, the Pokemon developer creatures is hiring for work.

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:14.600
Um, and indeed what they're hiring for is for next generation hardware.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:20.600
The listing actually says research and development for other next generation hardware is listed

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:24.600
as this role's workflow.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:30.600
Um, meaning that they may be planning a project to show up on a future platform.

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:35.600
Um, there, the job position is actually for a 3D CG character modeler.

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:40.600
So, I mean, Hey, also if anyone wants a job, go apply, I guess.

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:49.600
Um, but yeah, uh, and since they've, you know, been working on a Pokemon like that,

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.600
it stands to reason.

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:54.600
It could be another one, especially since the switches had like five of five mainline

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:55.600
Pokemon games.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:59.600
And a new, a new one's going to be out right around the time.

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.600
Our next show is, I think, in fact, I think gen nine will be out by the time we have our

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.600
next episode.

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.600
So I'm really excited about that.

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:12.600
I mean, they've been involved with Pokemon since the, the get go, but they only started

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:18.600
working with game freak, like ones that went to 3D in 2013.

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:21.600
So it'd be interesting to see what happens.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.600
I'm being corrected on my Broadway, uh, by Rama, who says that Beetlejuice is at the

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.600
marquee theater.

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:29.600
The music man is currently playing at the winter garden.

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:32.600
That must be the revival that had Hugh Jackman at one point.

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.600
I don't think he's in it anymore, but anyway, thank you for the update.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.600
That's going to be gone in a few months.

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:39.600
Yeah.

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:40.600
All right.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.600
Let's, uh, get one more story here.

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.600
Oh, this is about Mega Man 11.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:45.600
That's right.

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.600
I want to talk about this release because this is interesting.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.600
Mega Man 11 has now, Oh, he is still in it.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.600
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:51.600
Okay.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.600
Anyway, uh, we'll, we'll have to do a Broadway spinoff show as a different show.

01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:00.600
At some point, we still owe the listeners a foodie Oh show, by the way, it's been, it's

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.600
literally been a year, but that was my fault.

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:04.600
Uh, take full confession for that.

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:05.600
Anyway.

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:12.600
Um, Mega Man 11, 1.6 million in sales, uh, with the recent Capcom data with that, uh,

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:17.600
it actually now is the best selling Mega Man game in the franchise.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.600
Uh, that is coming again from Capcom.

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.600
Uh, they updated the sales figures on their site.

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:28.600
Uh, and this means that Mega Man 11 is number 67 overall with 1.6 million in sales.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:35.600
Uh, Mega Man 2 used to be the best selling in the franchise, 1.51 million in sales.

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:39.600
Of course, this has a lot of people asking, all right, Mega Man 12, when?

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.600
No comment yet from Capcom, but I will remind everyone.

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:43.600
The game awards is coming.

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:48.600
Don't set the bar too high, but you know, if there was a good time to announce Mega

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.600
Man 12, I think that would certainly be the time.

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:55.600
So, all right, let's move on.

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.600
Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.600
are, uh, coming out soon in a country near you.

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:06.600
And this is, this is now the time where it's going to start to amp up, right?

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.600
Nope.

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:09.600
Not this week?

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.600
Really?

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:11.600
I would have thought we're in November now.

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:12.600
Come on.

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.600
We're, we're in the, we're in the fifth quarter now.

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.600
So it's, it's not a lot.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.600
No, actually there are things coming out.

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:25.600
So we have a game called a little to the left that's on PC and Mac, uh, football manager

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:34.600
2023 on PC, Mac, and into the switch PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series, iOS, and Android.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:41.600
Sifu is going to be coming to a Nintendo switch, Sonic frontiers on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:45.600
four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:49.600
We have God of war Ragnarok on PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.600
Uh, let's see.

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:57.600
Hakonewa, um, Bokujo, Kitsuju, um, Muru or Mura.

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:58.600
I'm sorry.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:39:59.600
Mispronounced the last part.

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:02.600
Um, that is on Nintendo switch.

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.600
Aichu, kazoo tight.

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.600
That's on a Nintendo switch.

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:12.600
I added that subtitle, obviously, uh, police simulator patrol officers on PlayStation four,

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:19.600
PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series, tactics over reborn on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:25.600
four, PlayStation five Valkyrie Elysium on PC.

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.600
And I believe that's it for the week.

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:37.600
Rob, you are muted, Rob.

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:38.600
I'm very sorry about that.

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:39.600
Wow.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.600
I made a booboo.

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:41.600
Uh, okay.

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.600
So let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases there.

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:48.600
And, uh, we'll start with, uh, Sonic frontiers on the Nintendo switch is coming out.

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:53.600
Uh, it says it is an English version, so I don't think they're, um, uh, uh, making a

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:56.600
Japanese dub for that, but that will be released on the switch on November 8th.

01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.600
Um, so that is coming out.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:03.600
Um, also on the switch this week in Japan, I chew, uh, in a regular and a limited edition

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.600
box set is coming out as well as Hakon.

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:07.600
No.

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.600
Yeah.

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.600
Uh, Boku Joe hit suja.

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.600
Mora is out this week.

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:16.600
Commandos two and three HD remaster double pack is also out this week on the 10th of

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.600
November.

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.600
That is all on the switch.

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.600
It looks like this, they even kind of do multiple days because on the 11th, we have tactics

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:26.600
ogre reborn is also being released to Japan.

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:27.600
Again, that one is not being localized.

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:30.600
It's just an English release, but it is being released in Japan.

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:35.600
And for those that collect amiibo, there are some Splatoon related amiibo coming out in

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:36.600
Japan this week.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.600
So check that out.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.600
Uh, meanwhile, traveling over to the PlayStation five this week in Japan, Sonic frontiers is

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.600
also on the PlayStation five this week.

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:50.600
God of war Ragnarok also releases on in Japan the same day as the U S and, and assumably

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:51.600
everywhere else in the world.

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:55.600
Um, there is a special dual sense wireless controller that goes with that, that they

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:56.600
are releasing in Japan.

01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:59.600
I think that controller is actually coming out everywhere, but there's also a PlayStation

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:02.600
five bundle, regular and limited edition.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.600
Um, I'm not sure what makes it special besides the fact it comes with the game.

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:10.600
Cause it doesn't seem to have even the branded controller with it, but, um, cool.

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:12.600
I guess maybe if you want that anyway.

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.600
Cool.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:18.600
Uh, and then lastly, WRC generations is also released on the PlayStation five in Japan

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.600

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:22.600
One more Mount and blade to banner Lord.

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.600
It sounds pretty cool.

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.600
How about Europe?

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:26.600

We have Sonic frontiers for the big three, four, uh, looks like for a PC, we have football

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:44.600
Of course it's real football and not American football.

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:48.600
Uh, PlayStation on the eighth also is stray.

01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:54.600
Uh, for switch, we have see who, um, for the three, we have Cobra Kai two dojos, which

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.600
is like two dojos rising.

Um, on the ninth.

01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:04.600
Now we have God of war, rock and rock on PlayStation, uh, on the 10th for PlayStation and switch.

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:07.600
We have horse tales, Emerald ranch valley.

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:14.600
Uh, I, I think I was watching, I think it's already out over here as I was watching, uh,

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:15.600
Holly play it.

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.600
It's me, Holly.

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:24.600
Um, also in the 10th, we have asterix nublisk, uh, very, uh, uh, British institution there

01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:25.600
on the big three.

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:30.600
Also for the same, we have Garfield lasagna party, leave out Garfield.

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:32.600
I just want the lasagna party.

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:33.600
Okay.

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:36.600
Um, and then we also have dark D A R Q.

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:41.600
Um, on the 11th, we have tactics, ogre reborn for PlayStation and switch for switch.

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:42.600

Um, for the 11th, we have yum, yum cook star.

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:52.600
And then finally on the 12th, we have Atari 50, the anniversary celebration.

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:56.600
Um, did I'm adding this tactics ogre that's on the 11th.

01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:57.600
Yeah.

01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:01.600
Um, it just looks like there's like a whole bunch of like revival series.

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:11.600
Is it just me or like there is a Siberia, uh, game coming out and, uh, like, uh,

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.600
like just gun grave, you know, all coming up.

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:16.600
It's so interesting.

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:20.600
I think, um, Bobby had mentioned on his show at some point, it makes a lot of sense that,

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:23.600
you know, we're seeing a lot of games right now that are kind of things that were developed

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:27.600
during COVID and the, you know, the pandemic and all that, and that doing remasters and

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:32.600
things like that are a little easier to do, um, uh, remote working and that whole setup

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.600
than maybe doing a new game.

01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:40.600
So you're probably seeing a lot of the fruits of that and just what has happened with pandemic.

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:46.600
And plus I think the market's kind of shown that those games, people will buy them.

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:49.600
You know, there's a lot of us that love to revisit the classic games, but there's a lot

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.600
of people very thrilled about sweet code and one and two getting remastered and so on.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.600
There's lots of remasters that happens as part of the industry.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:00.600
We get more excited about reboots in the video game space than we do in the movie space.

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.600
That's for sure.

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.600
And what good reason.

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:05.600
All right.

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.600
Well, if that is it for release dates, then we will move on and get a few more news stories

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:14.600
for you before we open up the phones to any more callers that want to call in time.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.600
We already heard from Rama earlier in the show, but we're certainly willing to hear

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:18.600
from some more people.

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:23.600
Just head on over to our discord server, vog network.com slash discord, which by the way,

01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:25.600
it had some upgrades behind the scenes this week.

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:27.600
We're now an official community server.

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:31.600
Uh, so we just have a few extra features, nothing too, too fancy.

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.600
Uh, but we did reorganize some rooms and things like that.

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:39.600
So that way, all the notifications for when, uh, we're live or hosts affiliated with a

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:42.600
network or live, things like that, they all moved into a different channel.

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:46.600
So, um, you can, uh, you can, you know, see all that.

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:49.600
So, and I do want to acknowledge, I see the hype train going in chat.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:54.600
I usually don't, uh, read all the donators as we go because we are taping for the podcast.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.600
So it's a little hard to do that Twitch thing that a lot of people do where you kind of

01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.600
interrupt what you're doing to thank everyone.

01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.600
But I just want to call out.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.600
I see that.

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.600
Thank you.

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.600
You all don't have to do that, but you are, and I'm just very appreciative.

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:05.600
Thank you for that.

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:08.600
Um, so let's move on with a few more news stories.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:09.600
Loki.

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:10.600
Yeah.

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:15.600
You thought you could go a week without Activision ruining your day with news of maltreatment

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.600
of their employees, but here we are another week where they're still not treating their

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:21.600
employees right.

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:28.600
So, um, there was a report from the, uh, union of QA testers.

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:34.600
Uh, so that's the game workers Alliance, uh, talking about their ongoing negotiations

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:35.600
with Activision.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:43.600
Um, so they've had meetings now talking about, apparently this was the fourth contract bargaining

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:44.600
session.

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.600
Um, it didn't go anywhere.

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:51.600
They refused Activision refused to basically meet any of their demands.

01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:58.600
Um, they wouldn't change their hours or, um, out they said, or outsource the unionized

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:04.600
jobs in the future, um, or not assurances that they wouldn't change hours or outsource

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.600
those jobs.

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:13.600
Um, they also refuse to guarantee, um, require or basically include protections for employees

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:20.600
require reproductive healthcare and services because of, you know, Roe V Wade being overturned.

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:26.600
And also the immediate 10% pay increase for QA testers.

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:31.600
And on top of all that, they refuse to compensate them for time during negotiations, which I

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:37.600
believe my understanding is required by law that they have to pay them for negotiation

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:39.600
meeting time as well.

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:45.600
Um, because they're still on the clock, but you know, Activision, the Activision, and

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.600
they're just going to, they're going to wait until someone punishes them for that.

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:52.600
Cost of doing business, I guess.

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:55.600
When in the fuck is Kotick going to be out of there?

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:59.600
Like, I can't like counting down the days, counting down the day.

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:03.600
Well, it's just, I mean, you know, there's, there's new people coming in and they have

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:04.600
the same mentality though.

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:10.600
Like we talked about, was it that Lulu Chang at MERT, um, Missouri or whatever, who was

01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:14.600
like, you know, trolling people on Twitter or something like that.

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:16.600
Like, I don't know.

01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:17.600
Yeah.

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:20.600
And then, you know, I guess we haven't talked about it yet on the show, but then you have

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:22.600
everything that's going on at Twitter.

01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:24.600
Let's talk about the place where all this stuff comes out.

01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:25.600
Twitter.

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:29.600
I did have to repost that with a big fuck you to Activision.

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.600
What a disaster Twitter is turning into quickly.

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:37.600
And I'm telling you one day, one day in the very new feature, we're going to try to go

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.600
to that website and it is not going to work.

01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:43.600
And the staff will be gone that could have brought it back.

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:47.600
So you all remember the fail whale from 15 years ago.

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.600
It's going to be back.

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.600
So I just, yeah, I know there's a lot of people looking for alternative sites right now.

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.600
I don't, I don't know what it is.

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.600
Uh, you know, there's a lot of options that are out there.

01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:01.600
Some people are talking about, I don't know, Mastodon.

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:03.600
There's things I like.

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:05.600
I'm not going to Mastodon, it's a mess.

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:06.600
There's things I like about it.

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.600
There's things I don't like about it.

01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.600
I think some of the terminology they've used over there is a disaster.

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:15.600
I understand in principle how it's built and the advantages of that.

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:20.600
I think the way they're marketing it is really terrible, but something like that,

01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:24.600
that's open source is not meant to be marketed.

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:26.600
So I, I don't know.

01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:27.600
I don't know how to fix that.

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:30.600
Um, I like co-host a lot.

01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:33.600
I like what they're doing, but co-host has that line to get in now.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.600
And also co-host feels really rough around the edges.

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:39.600
Like it just, it needs to grow, grow a little more.

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:42.600
I know a lot of people are turning to Discord, um, to fill that in.

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:44.600
Discord's a little different from Twitter to me.

01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:45.600
I don't know.

01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:49.600
And there's people that are going to say, I'm sticking with Twitter till the bitter end.

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.600
Um, and you know, y'all do what you have to do.

01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:54.600
I've made my stance pretty clear.

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.600
If the orange one gets unbanned, I'm leaving Twitter.

01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:03.600
Um, and I don't, I don't, I've, I've worked very hard over 15 years to build up a following on Twitter.

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:05.600
And that is very hard to do.

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:06.600
I don't want to be associated with that.

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.600
And no, I'm not just going to mute them.

01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:11.600
I don't want to be associated with that platform anymore if that happens.

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:13.600
So it's, it's quite that simple.

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:14.600
I can do whatever I want.

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:15.600
So can you.

01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:20.600
So, um, that, that, and that's, that's what I'm telling you will happen.

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:23.600
Uh, Bobby Blackwell for the good point, download your archive.

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.600
Uh, that's a good suggestion.

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.600
I did, when I deactivated Facebook for a little while, I downloaded my archive before I did that.

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.600
I think that's a very smart call to download your archive.

01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:34.600
And don't just download your archive if you're planning on leaving.

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:42.600
Download your archive, end of sentence, because again, there's going to come a day when you go to twitter.com and it's not going to work.

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.600
I'm, I can, I, I, I, I would be very confident.

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:57.600
Somebody's going to try to fuck with Twitter on the outside, meaning like a DDoS or something to take it down.

01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.600
Um, it's really only a matter of time.

01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:02.600
So just a suggestion.

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:06.600
Anyway, let's talk about Twitter blue thing also.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:10.600
It's just, it's unnecessary.

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:14.600
Like I, I would have something that worked.

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:15.600
Yeah.

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:20.600
Well, and now that there's a shenanigans at the layoffs and then calling to ask people to come back because they're fucking up.

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:21.600
Yeah, no, that's all.

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:22.600
That's a whole mess.

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:26.600
The layoffs in general were highly illegal.

01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:30.600
I'm just, uh, I have so much like irritation right now.

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:39.600
As the show and her mat says just before the start of the show tonight, Kathy Griffin got perma suspended from Twitter for impersonating Lex Luther.

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:41.600
So yeah, everybody's doing that.

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.600
It's the, it's the new, the new meme, I guess.

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:45.600
Yeah.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:51.600
Well, the, the, the self-proclaimed meme Lord apparently said, let the comedy begin or something like that.

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:55.600
Cause you know, that's what intelligent CEOs do when they take over a multi-billion dollar company.

01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:02.600
And now also just tweeted today, people that impersonate accounts that don't label themselves a parody account will be permanently suspended.

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:04.600
Well, where did the comedy show go, buddy?

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:06.600
Oh, right.

01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:07.600
He can't take a joke.

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:08.600
Obviously.

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:11.600
It's just the whole thing is just reused.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:21.600
But anyway, but you know what, in a way, here's the light at the end of the tunnel where Kathy Griffin goes, not just her it's, it's, you know, cause I know she's a very polarizing people.

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:30.600
I'm going to say wherever Lady Gaga goes, wherever Oprah goes, that will be the new social network.

01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:33.600
But I don't know if they go anywhere.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:34.600
You know what?

01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:38.600
The world existed and the world turned without Twitter.

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:41.600
You survived without Twitter.

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:44.600
Everything will be okay without Twitter.

01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:46.600
It sucks, but it'll be okay.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:48.600
I can't get it in my settings.

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:50.600
Like my settings link is gone.

01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:52.600
Oh, weird.

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:55.600
Anyway.

01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:56.600
All right.

01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:57.600
Let's move on.

01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:58.600
We have more stories to talk about.

01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:00.600
Actually, I think the next one is yours, Dark Soccer.

01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:02.600
Yeah.

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:27.600
So, there is a big legal requirement now that for any video game company in New York City with over four employees, it has to give a good faith salary range in its job listings.

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:35.600
That includes companies like Take Two, Rockstar, a few other games.

01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:44.600
I mean, the industry doesn't have like the biggest footprint in the city, but I think it's a very good thing.

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:53.600
I think every company should do this is that everyone should, every company should be listing their pay ranges when they put up a job listing.

01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:58.600
Epic is among them.

01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.600
Twitch is having to do it.

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:09.600
Activision is listing a measurement lead role with the salary putting on it.

01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:20.600
But basically, the majority of companies are not going to list how much they're going to offer to pay.

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:23.600
And I think that this is a very good thing.

01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:34.600
In fact, the same sort of law is going to be going into effect in California and Washington State where an employer has to list pay ranges.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:42.600
This is a big departure as well from the days where they're like, oh, well, here's what you make and don't tell anybody.

01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:48.600
I'm like, tell everybody what you make and make sure that you are being paid.

01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:55.600
If you're being paid less than one of your coworkers, you go to HR and you ask them why.

01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:11.600
If your base pay is lower, especially women, people of color, non-binary, anyone who is not the quote default white cisgender straight man.

01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:15.600
Definitely talk about your salary.

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:18.600
I think this is a good thing.

01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:22.600
This is affecting all jobs listed in New York City.

01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:27.600
Yes, but obviously this is impacting the game industry, which we follow here.

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:32.600
But also, I do notice that laws like this, because they were talking about doing something like this in California.

01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:34.600
I don't remember if they actually did it or not.

01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:36.600
No, the legislation is going through.

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:37.600
That's what I said.

01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:38.600
Got it.

01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:49.600
Also giving a tip that Glassdoor tends to have a lot of salary ranges because people will post them on Glassdoor and say what they make when they can have a little anonymity to it.

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:54.600
I know a lot of people use that website when they're researching places to work and things like that.

01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:57.600
All right, moving on.

01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:01.600
Speaking of Twitter antics and what they've led to, right, Loki?

01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:18.600
Yeah, so they've led to some, well, people obviously leave Twitter, including Nabilian or Nibel, who has been a popular news source in the gaming industry for quite a while.

01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:23.600
Aren't they one that posts insider leaks and stuff like that as well?

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:25.600
I'm not really sure.

01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:26.600
Admit it.

01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:27.600
I never followed them.

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:32.600
I recognize the icon, but I didn't follow them personally.

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:37.600
I also don't follow Wario64, but how can you not miss what that person posts?

01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:40.600
It's everywhere whenever they post something.

01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:46.600
When that person leaves Twitter, that's pretty big.

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.600
Yeah.

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:52.600
Basically, they're moving to Patreon.

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:56.600
Today, I will move on from both Twitter and Patreon.

01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:00.600
There won't be any games coverage from me on either platform.

01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:04.600
I'm not doing Patreon anymore either.

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:06.600
I don't know where they're going to go then.

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:07.600
Interesting.

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:09.600
On vacation.

01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:10.600
Probably.

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:12.600
Hopefully.

01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:14.600
Well, best of luck.

01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:17.600
Bobby Blackwolf in chat said nobody wanted to pay him, so he shifted what he was doing.

01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:25.600
There was a lot of people that I saw commenting, like I didn't even know he had a Patreon to use.

01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:29.600
But Bobby does clarify that he's leaving the industry.

01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:35.600
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, I didn't follow Nabelle, but I respected the work they did.

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:37.600
All right.

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:39.600
Moving on, I got one more story.

01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:45.600
Kind of a cute little feel-good-ish type of story that goes back to our roots and where we all met each other.

01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:52.600
Of course, playing music games in the arcade, Dance Dance Revolution, and we met many great people through the years playing in the arcade.

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:59.600
Somebody else in the music industry who really grew up on DDR was Porter Robinson.

01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.600
Things have come full circle.

01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:06.600
Porter Robinson now has a song, actually two songs, in Dance Dance Revolution.

01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:10.600
He actually posted a nice thing on Twitter and Instagram.

01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:12.600
It was really cute.

01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:15.600
It says, I'll read the caption here because I'm not going to play the video.

01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.600
The caption says, my songs are coming to DDR officially.

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:22.600
It's almost impossible to fully explain how much this means to me.

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:26.600
DDR was so formative in my life that I'm certain I'd be a completely different person without it.

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:34.600
In fact, the only reason I started trying to make music as a little kid was to make songs for DDR.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:44.600
He talks in the video about how the music, the bright visuals, introducing Japanese music, getting influence from Japanese culture, all that has influenced him.

01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:49.600
I think we've all seen that DJ set he did where he incorporated Look to the Sky into it.

01:58:49.600 --> 01:59:01.600
Anyway, a very similar worded song called Look at the Sky, one of his songs from the album Nurture, is going to be added to DDR along with the song Something Comforting.

01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:03.600
Those were just added to DDR.

01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:09.600
I believe this last week through the magic of EMUs and the internet and all that are on the DDR machines now.

01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:15.600
So you can check that out at your local round one or wherever you have a DDR machine that's hooked up to the internet.

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:17.600
But congrats to Porter Robinson on that.

01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:18.600
That was great.

01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:21.600
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, it was hard not to get a little choked up watching that video.

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:22.600
Yeah, for sure.

01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:24.600
It was awesome.

01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:26.600
So congrats.

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:27.600
That's great.

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:30.600
All right.

01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:32.600
Anyway, Porter Robinson is really cool.

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:35.600
His brother's a fucking dick, but he's cool.

01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:37.600
All right.

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:39.600
Anyway, let's move on.

01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:48.600
Let's talk the listener roundtable and invite your comments over at our Discord server, vog.network.com slash discord.

01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:54.600
If you want to join our green room, you can do so and we'll bring you on to the show.

01:59:54.600 --> 02:00:02.600
And if you want to send us a mail email, you can participate at orange songs radio.com is the place to send us an email.

02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:06.600
Unfortunately, this week I am told we had dust.

02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:09.600
Anyone know dust?

02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:12.600
Anyone know dust?

02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:15.600
So that is an empty mailbag.

02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:19.600
Participate at orange songs radio.com.

02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:27.600
And if you have questions for us in chat, we'll take those as well over at twitch.tv slash vog network about anything we didn't talk about yet.

02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:30.600
Digirama S tags me and says, tell us how you really feel.

02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:31.600
I did.

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:35.600
Loki, do we have any last minute stories?

02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:44.600
Well, just, you know, something that is kind of annoying, but I guess it's to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Candy Crush.

02:00:44.600 --> 02:01:07.600
So, of course, they decided to do a huge 500 drone sign just over New York to celebrate Candy Crush and our dystopian future where they're going to be advertising in mobile games in the night sky where you can't avoid it.

02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:17.600
Is that is that what an appropriate follow up to talking about Porter Robinson's song, look at the sky and see the latest ads guy.

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.600
It's it's advertisements.

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:20.600
We've now resorted.

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:23.600
We've now resorted to advertising in space.

02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:25.600
Like like.

02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:31.600
It's cool that you're celebrating 10 years of Candy Crush, but you know, you could like.

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:32.600
Who's this for?

02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:34.600
Take out a full page ad in New York Times or something.

02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:35.600
And then they couldn't do it.

02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:42.600
They couldn't technically launch it from New York because they have to do it from Jersey because New York's like, no, you can't do that kind of stuff.

02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:43.600
But they're like.

02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:48.600
Well, it's going to be so big, you'll see it from Jersey, so it's fine.

02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:49.600
Yeah.

02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:50.600
All right.

02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:53.600
Well, I do not see anybody in the green room.

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:58.600
I think we're about out of topics for tonight, so we'll go ahead and move to wrap things up tonight.

02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:03.600
As a reminder, we will not be here next week just due to personal obligations.

02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:05.600
Won't be here next week.

02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:09.600
However, we will be back in two weeks, ironically, on all this DDR talk.

02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:10.600
Guess what?

02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:12.600
It is 20 November in two weeks.

02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:15.600
So we're actually doing a show on 20 November this year.

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:16.600
So that's right.

02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:20.600
And it's episode 937, which is nothing like 573.

02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:24.600
But like you'd you'd have on Wordle, you'd got two yellow boxes with that.

02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:26.600
So there's that anyway.

02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:28.600
Let's wrap things up.

02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:31.600
I want to say thank you to everybody for listening to our show tonight.

02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:36.600
Thank you for listening us either live or on the podcast feed, however you chose to

02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:37.600
consume Orange Launch Radio.

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:39.600
Thank you so much for being here and doing so.

02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:41.600
I really appreciate you.

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:43.600
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:45.600
Oh, if you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend or two.

02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:48.600
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:51.600
But, you know, we need more voices to put out here on air.

02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:53.600
So I really appreciate that.

02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:57.600
So, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, speaking of a fun social thing, we got a general chat

02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:00.600
room in the VOG Discord now where we can talk about all the things.

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:01.600
Come join and chat during the week.

02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:02.600
Yes.

02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:03.600
Come say hello.

02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:04.600
I do.

02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:05.600
I lurk.

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:09.600
I don't always actively chat, but it's hard to shut me up sometimes.

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:10.600
So there is that.

02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:11.600
So.

02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:12.600
Oh.

02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:13.600
All right.

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.600
Dark Sakura, let's go around and get final thoughts.

02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:17.600
What is your final thought for tonight?

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:19.600
I am streaming.

02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:23.600
I won't be doing a lot of talking, but I would love for people to play with me tonight.

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.600
All right.

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:26.600
Check it out.

02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:28.600
On that note, I'll pop out.

02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:29.600
Later taters.

02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:30.600
Take care.

02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:31.600
All right.

02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:33.600
Loki, we'll go to you and your final thought tonight.

02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:38.600
My final thought is I'll be working more on my content again and hopefully going to fix

02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:39.600
my DDR machine.

02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:41.600
I'd be curious to find out what's wrong.

02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:42.600
Yeah.

02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:45.600
I want to hook up the actual arcade part of it.

02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:46.600
I hope it doesn't.

02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:47.600
I hope that's still working.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:48.600
Yeah.

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:49.600
That would be sad.

02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:50.600
That would be sad.

02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:51.600
Let's see.

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:56.600
But if, you know, you end up having to do something else with that machine, I know people

02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:57.600
you can talk to.

02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:58.600
No, no.

02:03:58.600 --> 02:03:59.600
I would just replace the computer.

02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:02.600
Like that would just, it would cost like almost nothing.

02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:03.600
Fair enough.

02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:04.600
Let's see.

02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:05.600
My final thought.

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:08.600
I don't really have a whole lot that comes to mind automatically.

02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:13.600
I just, I'm sorry I won't be here next week, but at the same time breaks are important.

02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:16.600
So, always take a moment to take a break.

02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:19.600
You know, a lot of things, especially with all the crap going on on social media, a lot

02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:22.600
of things can feel very overwhelming sometimes.

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:24.600
There's just a lot of weird shit out there sometimes.

02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:29.600
So, like never be ashamed or afraid to take a break.

02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:33.600
Mental health is important and it's okay to say, I'm not feeling great today.

02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:35.600
I'm going to take a break.

02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:38.600
So, not that I'm saying that that's all impacting OLR, but I'm not.

02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:41.600
I'm just saying, you know, don't apologize for taking a break.

02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:42.600
Everybody's got to do it once in a while.

02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:43.600
So, take a break.

02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:45.600
I guess that's my final thought.

02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:46.600
All right.

02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:47.600
That's it.

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:48.600
We'll see you next time here on Orange Dance Radio.

02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:50.600
We'll be back in two weeks.

02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:51.600
Have a great week.

02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:55.600
Thank you to all the veterans out there because it is Veterans Day weekend next weekend.

02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:57.600
That's why it's a long weekend in part.

02:04:57.600 --> 02:04:59.600
So, thank you to veterans.

02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:01.600
Enjoy Veterans Day and thank you to everybody.

02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:03.600
Have a good two weeks.

02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:05.600
We'll see you back on 20 November.

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:06.600
Have a good night, everybody.

02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:07.600
Bye.
