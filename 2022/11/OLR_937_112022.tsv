0	13220	It's cold outside and I have snow on the ground. That means it's the time of year where
13220	17360	best game, best music, best story actually matters. That's right, the Video Game Awards
17360	20880	has released their nominees and voting is active. You can also vote via a bot on their
20880	24960	Discord group. That's new. Discord is quickly becoming the next everything social network.
24960	27600	And not a moment too soon because Twitter decided to sell to a social network. This
27600	31360	episode is being recorded on a popular music gaming date. Now it's time for your hosts Rob
31360	34000	Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the
34000	37120	week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
39360	44160	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where
44160	48400	every gamer has a voice. Sorry, it's my first time hearing that intro tonight. You just listened in
48400	52560	advance but that one I went into without hearing it and Jason's really funny. Appreciate the work
52560	58560	he does there. Where was I? Hi, welcome back. It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio. Tonight,
58560	65520	the 20th of November, 2022. 20 November, a beat matching holiday. I'll get into that in a minute.
66400	72480	And it's episode number 937 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with y'all every
72480	76640	single week except last week. We were actually not here last week. So we're back after a week off.
77520	84080	Not joining us tonight unfortunately, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. Jamie, as you know, she's been
84080	88480	dealing with her voice issues and while those are getting better, I'm sure you all are well aware
88480	91840	because she's been talking about it on this show that her mom has been going through some medical
91840	95920	issues and I know she did like a marathon on her personal stream. What's great is that she raised,
95920	99600	I believe it was a thousand dollars for her mom's medical care on that stream that she did on the
99600	106240	15th. So props to that. She actually is taking this week and next to go be with her family. So
106240	112000	she's actually with her mom and some of her other family members, both biological and chosen out in
112000	115760	Alabama. So she's not going to be joining us tonight or next week. Perfectly understandable
115760	121680	why after that scenario, she is spending some time with her family. So we'll talk to her when
121680	127120	she gets back in a few weeks. But in the meantime, we do have, of course, as he is here with us every
127120	133360	week, say hello to Tech Master, Loki. Hello. Hi, Loki. How are you doing? I'm getting over cold.
133360	139440	Oh, same. I've been battling this like thing for like two weeks. It's stinky and it's not COVID.
139440	143760	I tested a million times for that because of course, I'd be the one to get it three times,
143760	147280	right? But no, it's not COVID. It's like, oh yeah, there's other illnesses too, right?
148000	154640	Yeah. Basically, my wife had it first and then I caught it later, like a week or two later.
155360	165840	So yeah, it's just like a congestion, a cough now. Well, it's a bummer, but I hope you were able to
165840	170400	have a good week off anyway. Yeah, it was fun. Yeah. Did you do anything exciting or work on
170400	178800	Minecraft videos? I've been working on getting a modded server up and running to play modded
178800	183760	Minecraft. And so I finally did that and launched it today and live stream from it today also.
185600	193120	Except OBS decided to record two seconds of it and not three hours of it. But there's ways to
193120	203520	get around that. It's just being stupid. So I just have to, it's fine. It was more of just because I
203520	208960	haven't streamed on YouTube before. I've streamed only on Twitch. So it was setting that up too.
209280	215760	And so I expected stuff to be not perfect. And that's fine. It wasn't ideal recording
215760	222240	conditions either because my family was behind me, shouting and talking and all that stuff. So
222240	230640	it was, you know, typical first stream. Yeah. Yeah. So we do tape live, of course,
230640	235360	every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network at nine o'clock
235360	240320	Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And there's some folks in chat
240320	245680	like Mike deaf says happy 20 November. And this is an interesting comment in here. Pod culture
245680	251200	suggesting since dark soccer isn't here. Pod culture says, bring Shane on to talk Pokemon.
251200	257760	Well, funny. You should mention that. Hi, Shane. Hello. How are you? I'm fine. Now,
257760	262960	Shane doesn't have a webcam tonight cause he's shy. Uh, but we have, uh, I just don't have a
262960	266960	webcam. That's fine. We just, we have an appropriate avatar picked, uh, in your absence
266960	274720	tonight. Your, your V tubing will say, yeah, my little character was moving around uncontrollably
274720	280000	for some reason. Um, so yeah, this is a big week because Pokemon released this week and we'll get
280000	285680	into that in a little bit. Um, it's also 20 November, uh, which is, uh, kind of a big deal
285680	291200	in the, uh, beat matching world. I'll get into that in a little bit as well. Um, also one thing
291200	295920	I wanted to like briefly talk about, unfortunately I did not have the time to sufficiently prepare
295920	299280	this topic and I'll talk about why in a minute. So I'm going to kind of table this a little bit to
299280	305680	next week. But, um, this last week I was in, um, Seattle and I didn't say anything about this
305680	310480	because I didn't know for sure if this was going to happen, but, um, just in time to kind of
310480	317360	celebrate the launch of the new Pokemon game. Um, I, uh, was able to actually take a tour of the
317440	322480	offices at the Pokemon company international out in, uh, Bellevue. Uh, I have a friend that happens
322480	327600	to work out there and, uh, you know, I was able to take a pretty cool tour of the office. It's,
327600	332960	it's an office, you know, so, and no, there was, it's not like I was there to see any product or
332960	336880	anything like that. So don't, don't put your minds in that place. It was just to kind of see like,
336880	342000	what a neat, uh, Pokemon themed office building it was. Obviously I thought of you, Shane,
342000	346000	cause I was like, wow, Shane would like really love to see a lot of this stuff. Um, I took a
346000	351760	lot of pictures. I will absolutely share those. I apologize. I did not get through being able to
351760	355600	do that for tonight's show. There's just some other stuff that's come up. So we'll talk about
355600	361760	that, uh, next week on the show and I'll share the pictures. Um, I, I, before we get into some
361760	366080	of the gaming news though, I do want to bring a couple other things up because there are,
366640	370480	there are some important things going on in the world and I'm going to be like completely honest,
370480	375840	like I am a little bit tilted tonight, meaning like, you know, when we talk about like our
375840	380960	mental health and stuff, I'm, I'm not totally feeling it tonight. And I'm, I,
380960	385280	I know that might be a weird thing to say at the top of the show when we do these podcasts and,
385280	389120	you know, we get really excited to do them every week and I am, and I'm happy to be here with all
389120	393760	of you. Um, but there's just obviously a lot in the world that's going on that's sitting heavy
393760	399200	on me today. Um, not to be too dramatic about it, cause I've thrown enough of a fit online,
399200	402720	but you all know I'm pissed off about what happened with Twitter. I'm pissed off to the
402720	409040	fact that I left. Uh, and I have, I've privated my account. I'm not using it again. I've taken
409040	413360	the app off my phone. I didn't delete it because I don't want somebody impersonating me in 30 days,
413360	417840	uh, with the whole blue check thing and all that stuff. But obviously, um, I do not agree with the
417840	423360	decision decisions of Elon Musk. I do not agree that somebody that actively used the platform
423360	428000	to commit a crime against the United States, which is what, I mean, I realize people don't like it.
428000	432400	When I get political on this show, you can sugar coat that all you want. You can try to explain
432400	437440	all you want. You can try to excuse it all you want. People died because of tweets that that guy
437440	443360	wrote on January 6th. And the fact that it's a fucking poll that puts him back on the platform
443360	449120	when he knows that bots overrun that platform, which is why he tried to get out of buying it in
449120	456000	the first place. This guy consistently makes these business decisions and then changes his
456000	461840	mind on a whim. He is an absolutely terrible boss. And I, for one, am not going to help put
461840	468080	any money in his pocket. And if you are using Twitter right now, that is what you are doing.
468080	472400	And I'm not, I'm not judging. And I'm not saying like you're canceled or anything like that. Look,
472400	476880	I get it. There's no ethical consumption under capitalism. You have to choose what you have to
476880	482480	choose and all that stuff. But this, this is the line for me. And the reality is there is,
482480	488320	there is not a publicly owned company anymore. There is no Twitter stock anymore. There is one
488320	495520	owner of Twitter. And my continued use of that platform would be actively encouraging advertisers
495520	500720	and other things to put money into his pocket. And even if it's not money directly, guess what?
500720	505680	It's your information. It's the, it's the tracking of your data. It's the cookies that from
505680	511040	advertising websites and things like that. And I'm done. And yes, I understand that the one that he
511040	516240	unbanned says he's not going to come back. I don't give a fuck. It's the principle of the
516240	522640	whole thing. It's the line that was crossed. It's these continued demonstrated platforms that this
522640	532320	guy has no business running this company. It is the fattest of fat cats inhaling the town square.
532320	538320	He said, he says, oh, Twitter should be the town square. Then you, the richest man on the planet
538320	543280	shouldn't fucking own it and make these decisions. And I'm not playing into that hand anymore. I'm
543280	551680	done. So those that want to stay around. Cool. Me. Done. Uh, looking in comments and chat. Um,
552720	556640	let's see. Uh, YYR says, you know, the poll results didn't make a damn difference. He was
556640	560000	going to reinstate the orange Cheeto no matter what. Also the accounts of most slime balls
560000	564880	previously banned have been reinstated. Yeah. Agree. It's, it's not a place I want to be a
564880	569040	part of. Period. Uh, hi, dark soccer, dark soccer. So I need some chat after all. Um,
569040	573600	even though she's on, uh, uh, I w I would say vacation. It's not really vacation. She's on a,
573600	578240	uh, important trip this week of other sorts. Uh, he also doesn't hold any patents for any of his
578240	583360	own technology used in Tesla. He's an asshole. That's it. Like, let's just call it what it is.
583360	590480	He's an asshole period. And I don't want to, I don't want to make assholes money done. So anyway,
590480	594400	that's my soapbox on that. Sorry if it pissed you off, but also not sorry. That's my opinion.
594480	600240	I'm sticking to it. Does this impact video games? Absolutely. Think about how gaming culture has
600240	605600	changed for better and for worse because of this website, the access to developers that we have for
605600	609680	better. Like when we did the president cat thing, that was kind of fun years ago, right? Getting
609680	614160	ready, getting, being able to touch out to the developers and for worse, I'm not going to say
614160	622720	the name, but it rhymes with gamer hate worse, worse, worse. Anyhow, that's been weighing on my
622720	626720	mind. Then of course, obviously in the real world, we have the news of what happened in
626720	632160	Colorado Springs last night. And you know, this, this hurts my heart. And what happened there is,
632160	642000	is awful. It's terrible. And I'm frustrated beyond words because I know exactly what's going
642000	647360	to happen. I know exactly what's going to happen because this happens every single time. There's
647360	653200	one of these mass shootings and now it's a mass shooting that happens within the LGBTQIA plus
653200	659680	community. My people, I know exactly what's going to happen. Everybody on Twitter and such, all of
659680	665360	these politicians who don't give a fuck about LGBT people are going to be out there saying, this is
665360	670480	wrong. And our thoughts and prayers are with the family and this is wrong. And then you know what,
670480	674560	tomorrow, they're going to go back to writing their bills to try to ban drag queen brunches
674560	679280	because they've decided that's the battle they want to pick right now because these cunts out
679280	683520	there on Twitter, and I'm sorry, I use that word, but I'm talking about that one out of Colorado
683520	688240	and she is a cunt. And I have no other word to more accurately describe it because she's going
688240	692880	to be the one that goes out there on Twitter. And then she's going to say, Oh, you should be,
692880	698880	and she said this, you should be having your kids in church, not at a drag queen brunch.
698880	706160	Well, how many drag queens have been out there molesting children versus priests, Miss Boebert?
708000	714560	This is just, it's a sham. It's hate. It's a hate campaign. And I'm sick of it.
716000	720720	Look what it does to my tone. I do and say things I would not usually say
720720	725200	on air, but I'm sorry. Like, this is, this is what it is.
725680	732480	So these things are weighing heavy on my mind. And now there's another thing that that's come
732480	738640	to my attention. And there is no easy way to say this news. This is something that affects
738640	746960	everyone listening tonight. I got an email earlier today from one of our longtime listeners,
746960	752640	Obi Wan jabroni, who I think is in chat right now. And Obi Wan jabroni, you know, is, you know,
752720	757280	and Obi Wan jabroni, you know, is, is friends with other people that have been listening to
757280	762160	the show and participated with this community. And I'm not going to read the email word for word,
762160	766320	because I'm not sure if I'm allowed to do so. But and it's a, you know, it's private email.
766320	771920	And, but that's beside the point, I'm going to just tell you what it's about. And it's the fact
771920	779200	that one of our listeners who is named that I recognize from this chat, quite frequently,
779200	784640	Fat Ninja DM, somebody whose chat comments I know, I've read on this show as frequently
784640	788960	or as recently as like, not even a month ago, or whenever we were last, you know, on the program,
790320	796560	read comments on the show, somebody who has been kind enough to donate and send money and buy gift
796560	802000	subs for people and so forth. I think you probably know where I'm going with this, I received word
802000	810400	that Fat Ninja DM passed away yesterday. And it was sudden. It was not something that could have
810400	816960	been foreseen. And I'm not sure what else to say. And I'm sorry, I know that's not easy news to
816960	820880	deliver. But that is also something that's weighing on my mind today. Because, you know,
820880	827600	I talk a lot about how Orange Launch Radio is, you know, all of us that are sitting around at
827600	833360	the table after playing DDR at the arcade and how appropriate we're talking about that here on 20
833360	840160	November, after we're playing DDR at the arcade sitting around that table, and eating mozzarella
840160	846320	sticks and talking about games we love and what we're playing and what we're into. And Fat Ninja
846320	852400	absolutely had a seat at that table, talking about these things with us. So truly, we've lost one of
852400	859120	our own this week suddenly. And that hurts. There's no easy way to say it or sugarcoat it. So I'm
859120	863120	sorry, you have to kind of find out about it that way. But if any of you know a better way to deliver
863120	870960	news like that, I'm not sure what a better way to say that. So thank you. I see all the kind words
870960	876560	in chat. Rest in peace. Rest in power. RIP. Rest in power. Rest in power. You should be missed.
876560	885360	May his memory be a blessing. Yeah. I don't know what else to say about that. So I just kind of
885360	890720	wanted to get all that out there up front. I know, and I'm sorry, sorry, Shane. I know I was supposed
890720	894800	to invite you here tonight. We have a fun discussion about Pokemon and we will. Video games
894800	898640	are the things that take our minds off of things when a lot of crappy things are going on in the
898640	905600	world. But I also have to kind of be honest that like, if I'm not acting like myself tonight,
906560	910160	probably in some of my strong language that I just used previously, I'm not a little bit.
912560	918640	This is why. I'm just not really feeling it tonight. And I think it's OK to say that
919360	927280	out loud sometimes. But we move on and we'll talk about. Let me first open up the floor. I don't
927280	932320	know if either of you want to say anything or talk about anything. Loki, Shane, or I can just move on
932320	939280	is fine too. Don't really have anything more to add to it, unfortunately. No, I understand. Yeah,
939280	944400	I don't really have anything to say except for don't forget to add Jason David Frank to that list
944400	949440	this week too. Thank you for bringing that up. No, that is actually absolutely important. You know,
949440	954560	I don't have that same connection to the Power Rangers in my childhood that I think a lot of
954560	959920	other people do, and I'm not minimizing or I'm not saying it. No, absolutely. I completely understand
960480	967360	why people are really upset about that as well. That is weighing heavy for a lot of people today.
967360	973280	Because Kevin Conroy too. Oh yeah, that's a big. Oh my gosh. Yeah. A few days ago. Absolutely.
974320	979520	You know, these are icons of our childhood that are, you know, and especially, you know,
979520	984560	I think it's no secret. Jason David Frank apparently was a case of suicide. And that is
984960	991600	a tragedy all in its own that he felt that that was the answer. And just a lot of people are
991600	999040	really, you know, feeling that tonight and this weekend. And so I guess maybe I'm kind of
999040	1003360	expressing a lot of my feelings as well, because I bet a lot of you are having similar feelings this
1003360	1008720	weekend. I just want you to know, like, we're all going through it. It's okay. And I love these
1008720	1014080	comments in chat. SSG100Matt talking about Fat Ninja says, we're all family. Many of us have been
1014160	1017360	here for a while. Many of us have been here shorter. Regardless, we're all invited to the
1017360	1021360	friends giving table because of our awesome community. Thoughts are with Fat Ninja DM and
1021360	1025840	their family. Absolutely. Bobby Black Wolf says, I appreciate each and every one of you. And I'm
1025840	1036720	honored to be in the same space as you. Absolutely. Sorry. Mike Def says, don't be afraid to reach out
1036720	1052400	for help. Somebody take over, please. Yeah, it's been a rough, a long week, for sure. But, you
1052400	1056880	know, at least, at least we have like games and stuff to fall back on right now, especially when
1056880	1064080	things are difficult, you know, personal lives. I mean, certainly, all every, you know, hearing
1064080	1069040	even just like necessarily not, not friends per se, but even like, you know, the celebrity news
1069040	1073120	and stuff like that. And some of these people that aren't that old, or even that older than you is
1073120	1079440	like, geez, think about your own mortality all the time. It's just, you don't know how much time you
1079440	1084480	have, and you just hopefully spend it the best that you can, or spend the best way you can. So,
1085280	1090960	I mean, you know, I'm appreciative of all the listeners that we have and stuff. And I think,
1091920	1100640	you know, glad that he was able to spend as much time as he had with us. So, that was pretty nice.
1102720	1105840	Yeah, I don't know. I don't really have the, know what to say.
1106640	1111840	Shane, you want to talk about Pokemon? Alright, sorry about that. I'm back. Also,
1111840	1117280	not sorry. I let you know. So, but thank you for the kind words. They're actually, they're
1117280	1122640	obviously very meaningful in this moment. And I really, I understand. I'm fine. And I will be
1122640	1129920	fine. Part of me putting that out there into the universe is how I am fine. And that's what it is.
1129920	1133520	So, yeah, and thank you. Thank you again for the kind words and chat. I appreciate that.
1134080	1138560	Yes, please. Let's talk about Pokemon. I know it's an extremely awkward transition, but
1139360	1144960	it is how we take our mind off of things is with video games. And like Shane, I know like Pokemon,
1144960	1148640	this generation is something that you've been looking forward to for a very long time, right?
1148640	1151520	Like how, how long has the hype for this series been building?
1152960	1156960	Since they announced it, which went like a year ago. No, it was this year.
1157520	1162000	Was it? I guess at the beginning of this year. Yeah, yeah. It was relatively recent, right? So,
1163440	1168160	the games have arrived. First off, how many copies of Pokemon Violet and Scarlet did you pick up?
1169040	1172000	I mean, I don't have all my copies yet, but eight.
1175200	1177680	And remind us why you have to have eight copies of the game.
1178400	1187360	Okay. So, okay. So, I have the digital copies because they're just convenient. And then I
1187360	1194960	helped put a, a mom and pop game store together back in Idaho. And one of the things that they
1194960	1199200	were going to do for me was send me a copy of the, or give me a copy of the double pack.
1199200	1207120	So they've sent that to me. And then I have the UK version coming because of the double pack,
1207120	1213120	because it came with a steel book. And then I have the Japanese double pack coming because it came
1213120	1223760	with a special trading card game cards and some silverware. And I need them to play by myself. So
1223840	1226880	I don't have to play with other people. And I have five switches. So it works.
1229520	1230960	So which one did you play first?
1232480	1233280	Violet.
1233280	1235680	Violet. And how far are you in the game?
1235680	1236720	I beat it.
1236720	1238160	Oh, my gosh. Really?
1238720	1239920	I beat it today. Yeah.
1239920	1241920	Oh, wow. All right. But yeah.
1241920	1247760	So I beat the three stories and the fourth like culmination story.
1247760	1253520	Okay. Yeah. That's a good way of keeping it pretty vague. I like that. So, wow. Okay. So,
1254480	1259200	how, as a long time Pokemon fan, how was it? How are you feeling about the game now that
1259200	1263200	you've completed it? And I guess, you know, you've seen everything the game has to offer,
1263200	1264240	I guess. I mean, you don't.
1264240	1267520	No, I haven't seen everything the game has to offer. There's still like the post games.
1267520	1269200	I think you have to complete the Pokedex.
1269200	1272480	Okay. But for the most, you've seen probably more than most people at this point.
1273360	1283040	Yeah. I love it. I think it's fantastic. I would give it like a 10 out of 10 and it would be even
1283040	1287280	higher if it didn't have so many random bugs and things.
1288080	1292080	Yeah. I was going to say, having not played it, but having seen all the footage of it,
1292080	1297120	like, I think you, like, I think Pokemon fans give Nintendo's, well, not even Nintendo, but like
1297120	1303600	the Pokemon company way too many passes. Like, there is no excuse at this point for that game
1303600	1308080	to be that technically flawed. And I get it. Pokemon is a great game. And like, don't get
1308080	1313520	me wrong. I wish games like that that I like would be really great and, you know, technically
1313520	1322000	perfect Saints, bro. But I mean, yeah, at some point you got to go, listen, us continuing to
1322000	1328400	buy it in this state. It's not helping the situation. Like they're just cutting corners
1328400	1331840	and it's not because they have lack of skill developing games to the switch.
1331840	1339920	They've made three of them already or more. It's just sheer like ignorance. They're just
1339920	1342960	shipping it earlier than it needs to be done and they'll finish it later.
1344080	1348800	That's unacceptable. I don't think I'll finish it. I think, I think this is the product we're
1348800	1356240	going to get. This is it too. Yeah. Yeah. That's even worse. I, I, yeah, I like, yeah. And from my
1356240	1362320	perspective, obviously, like I, I do think the game itself is very fun. And at the end of the
1362320	1367120	day, that's what's most important, but like it would be, it would be a disservice to not call
1367120	1372000	out. Yeah. There's, there's some serious technical problems. Like I'm, I'm really reminded of the
1372000	1377440	launch of mass effect Andromeda. Like where you have just all those like really silly things that
1377440	1382080	were happening and all those like screenshots of things that are happening. And yeah, a lot of that
1382160	1386720	is, and it's not just like the one screenshot that's floating around Twitter. Like I've been
1386720	1393520	streaming the game and we keep seeing these things like these, like the weird things the camera does
1393520	1398960	when you try to go into buildings that aren't actually buildings and the whole frame rate of
1398960	1403680	people in the distance, just acting like a flip book. And so on some of this stuff, it's, it's,
1403680	1409680	it's, it's not a good look for the Nintendo switch, quite frankly. Now there's a part of me
1409680	1415200	that wonders, and maybe I'm giving Game Freak a lot of credit here, but there's a part of me
1415200	1423280	that wonders because I wondered this about RCS2, was this maybe designed for a different piece of
1423280	1428560	hardware than it actually came out on? You know, we knew, we've all heard those rumors about an
1428560	1434000	enhanced Nintendo switch that didn't end up happening. And instead we got the OLED switch
1434000	1440400	because of component shortages. And I wonder if that more high-end switch wasn't the system that
1440400	1444720	this game was really targeting, because it sure feels like I'm playing something in low settings
1444720	1450800	mode. If that's the case, then, then, then somebody, some executive needs to be at fault because
1451680	1455840	one, then you're pushing a game out that you know, can't run on the hardware,
1455840	1459840	number one, or number two, you should delete it for whenever this new system's coming out.
1460400	1464880	Because they have no problem doing that with like, say Breath of the Wild 2 or whatever we're
1464880	1469040	calling it nowadays. I don't remember the subtitle on it, but. Tears of the Kingdom, I think.
1469680	1475600	Whatever, who cares? It doesn't matter, it's Breath of the Wild 2. It's, it's unacceptable.
1475600	1478960	It's like, oh, well, we were going to have the system, like, assuming that that's what the
1478960	1486480	problem is, but like, there are other games that have come out that like No Man's Sky or even the
1486480	1493840	port of The Witcher 3 or whatever. Like there's so many very complex games that are developed by
1493840	1498880	different teams that have no trouble running on the hardware and looking as good as they are.
1498880	1506160	Look at like all the Xenosaga stuff or whatever. It's just, there's no excuses for it. Like,
1506160	1510640	I'm sorry. And it, because it's Pokemon, people are going to associate Pokemon with Nintendo,
1510640	1514080	and that's kind of a blemish on their brand. I don't care what they tell them. Oh, well,
1514080	1517840	it's a different company. I'm sorry. All the Pokemon games are on Nintendo and they're not
1517840	1523440	in any other consoles. So it's your company. I actually agree with that is that I know a lot
1523440	1528720	of people are very nuanced about Game Freak or versus Nintendo. It ultimately it's shot
1528720	1534160	for me because for me, it's honestly, it's a reflection of Nintendo's aging technology.
1534160	1539760	You know, I hate to, I hate, I hate to be one of those people that's like put Mario on PlayStation
1539760	1547520	5. But I'm like, maybe those people had a point. Like, maybe, maybe they had a point all this time.
1547520	1554000	But again, it's interesting. And I go to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network. We have a lot of
1554000	1559040	comments. DarkSakura says always be critical of what you love. Absolutely. Mike Dev says we can
1559040	1563200	criticize the game for having these issues. But if the game does, it's best to be fun and or
1563200	1567760	entertaining game that should also be said yes, both these things can be true. I can sit here and
1567760	1573920	say Pokemon is a fun game and I'm really enjoying my time playing it. And also say but boy is it a
1573920	1580400	train wreck of of technical issues that's going on there. And Shane, it sounds like it's funny
1580400	1586400	because somebody was saying Bobby Blackwolf said it's a perfect game. And it would be better than
1586400	1592640	perfect if it didn't have technical issues. That's that's how I feel. Yeah. So well, can you articulate
1592640	1596800	that a little more? So like, obviously, you must be reading and seeing all these things about the
1596800	1602560	technical issues. And does it frustrate you kind of hearing that people are making judgment on the
1602560	1606560	game based on the technical issues alone? Or do you kind of get it or like what what is your
1606560	1610880	reaction as a as someone who does really love the game with the technical issues debate?
1611680	1618400	Oh, no, it's hard for me to say because on one hand, I, I understand that you should knock points
1618400	1623920	off for how bad it runs sometimes and all the weird glitches and things. But on the other hand,
1623920	1631040	like, the underlying game is really fun. Like, the performance issues and glitches haven't had
1631680	1637760	any sort of, like negative impact on my game, except I had one crash that set me back like,
1638560	1645840	two hours. Because I, well, I turned off auto save. So it's my own fault for not saving. All right.
1646560	1652800	Um, so I don't know, I think, I think it's a great, great game. And, you know,
1652800	1658640	if the technical issues are something that bother you that much, then maybe it shouldn't be for you,
1658640	1664800	I guess, or maybe you should knock off points. But I've enjoyed games with crappy technical
1664800	1671200	issues before it's not going to unless it impedes my fun. I'm not going to give it any weight,
1671200	1673520	really. And it just hasn't.
1673520	1676720	Questbuster and chat has an interesting point talking about Bayonetta three,
1676720	1681520	it kind of being a similar situation. You also have some criticism of Bayonetta three on its
1681520	1686320	technical merits, not bad enough to overwhelm what it does extremely well, but enough to make
1686320	1691520	some takes wish it were on better hardware. And again, for me, that is really the takeaway is I go,
1692320	1698000	this shows that Nintendo needs to update the switch sooner rather than later. Like there
1698000	1703440	needs to be a swish refresh switch refresh next year. And I understand, you know, components and
1703440	1707680	you know, lol hardware and all that stuff. Some of that can still be a bit of a challenge. I think
1707680	1712160	it is getting a little better calm down though. But you know, but this is Nintendo we're talking
1712160	1719120	about who's always challenged that department. But I feel like Nintendo has got to remedy their
1719120	1728000	hardware. But at this at the same time, money talks, Nintendo is still selling oodles and oodles,
1728000	1733680	it probably will still be the number one selling console this holiday. So so do any of these
1733680	1740960	observations and these these taught does any of it matter? Not really. Because people are still
1740960	1754000	gonna buy it. Absolutely. guarantee it. Let's see. Oh, Mike deaf says there's a backup save code
1754000	1759600	for if the game crashes x B and up on the title screen if you've even if you don't have auto save.
1759600	1760240	That's interesting.
1760240	1762720	Oh, I know that. It doesn't matter. Now I beat it.
1763680	1768800	Yeah. Um, let's talk a little bit about so you know, when I was streaming the game,
1768800	1773760	I had some viewers that were kind of like, so what really are the differences between this
1773760	1779040	and the last generation of Pokemon because, you know, the last generation sword and shield the
1779040	1785760	whole concept of the wild area and the open area was sort of new to Pokemon. But it's it's kind of
1785760	1791680	hard to articulate that like, well, Pokemon generation nine is like, really open world,
1791680	1796880	like even more so than our say us really, which our CS was was like monster hunter,
1796880	1800240	it was section zones that you would go to right wasn't open world.
1800240	1805680	So but this one is like truly open world save for maybe the big cities you go to are still kind of
1805680	1813200	Yeah, mezzagoza is a loading screen, going into the gyms are a loading screen. And then one
1813200	1817680	specific place is also a loading screen. Yeah, but for the most part, it's like super open world.
1817680	1822480	But other than that, like what are some of the key differences from the last generation of Pokemon?
1823440	1833040	Um, I really think it's the open world mostly. The what else is different, like the three story
1833040	1837920	paths, I guess is different. You're not locked to doing just one thing. In fact, I went out of order
1839440	1843920	on accident, which was pretty fun because it made the game more challenging and people
1843920	1849360	asking for a challenge, you can get to places you definitely shouldn't be with your levels and still
1849360	1853920	attempt things you probably should be doing like a lot later from the time you're there.
1856400	1862320	What else? Oh, the raid battles are so fun, because they're not turn based in the sense
1862320	1867360	where everybody picks a move. And then everybody attacks and then the enemy attacks. It's all
1868400	1874480	it's more real time. And you can support your team with like various boosts and health up
1875440	1880080	moves, even if you brought a Pokemon that kind of sucks to the raid. So that's really fun to
1880080	1886720	I've been doing a lot of those. Uh, I don't know everything. It battles feel snappier,
1886720	1892720	even though the performance sucks. So I guess that's a credit to the new generation too.
1894480	1901760	I would say the biggest one for me that you missed is the auto battling is huge. I think
1901760	1907600	that fundamentally changes the flow of the Pokemon game for me because so so you use the
1907600	1911680	R button to send out your Pokemon, your Pokemon can kind of walk around with you and your Pokemon can
1911680	1918160	pick up items. But if you use the R key, it will also fight Pokemon and do it kind of automatically
1918160	1923600	like a fast battle. And it as long as you're getting your typings correct, and you aren't
1923600	1928720	trying to throw a weak Pokemon against something that you know, it's weak to, you can really grind
1928720	1935200	some XP. It is slower than the regular battle. Yes. But at the end of the day, it kind of washes
1935200	1939920	out where like, especially since the Pokemon tend to cluster a little bit like they did in Pokemon
1939920	1945520	Legends, you know, if you got the right Pokemon to send up against one of those clusters, you can
1945520	1952720	basically do the grinding of Pokemon XP with that. And so it means that your battles are really
1952720	1960080	reduced to when you want to catch Pokemon, NPC battles and gym battles. You don't have to do
1960080	1969120	grinding battles at all. Well, no, the XP you get from the let's go battles is I know it's pretty
1969120	1974720	less but it still washes out where like the time it takes to do it used to because like you can
1974720	1981600	bang out like 10 of those faster than it would take to do one of those longer battles. If you're
1981840	1988640	where a cluster is. Maybe I would have to test.
1988640	1996560	Go try it because I seriously like you can you can do it. So to me, that's the biggest game changer
1996560	2000640	for me with this generation is the auto battling and that whole sort of thing. But then yes,
2000640	2004960	the open world otherwise is more because it's it's items are in the open world TMS are in the
2004960	2010640	open world. So now you you know, craft with those and you know that crafting systems change. They
2010640	2015600	change breeding to to be the picnic things a lot. Oh, actually, it's speaking of quality of life,
2015600	2021600	like that there are no more computer boxes. That is the boxes float with you, like the boxes are
2021600	2026160	in your bag. That's been since sword and shield. Did they have that sort of shield? I thought you
2026160	2032640	started to go to a computer to do certain things. No, well, no. So they pulled from RCS and you can
2032640	2037440	change your moves on the fly, which is great. But like if you're trying to pull out a Pokemon or put
2037440	2041760	one away, that's been in there since sword and shield. I thought you still had to do that at a
2041760	2048000	computer. I don't know why I thought that. But anyway, it does seem like it's interesting to
2048000	2051760	talk about when there's technical issues, because it does seem like there's a lot of like quality
2051760	2058240	improvements. So yeah, there are and they just came with the price, which was the performance.
2058240	2064000	Well, I would, you know, if there is a super switch or a switch deluxe next year,
2064000	2071200	it would be really fascinating to see, like if this game automatically runs better on it.
2071200	2075920	Like if this game was already I think that would be very telling if this game is already
2075920	2080320	optimized under the hood for some type of super switch or something. So be very interesting.
2080320	2085680	It is because there's people that are emulating it on the PC and it's running just fine.
2085680	2091520	Oh, I didn't know that. That's a huge tell in my opinion.
2092000	2095440	Yeah, I think I think I don't know.
2098000	2102720	Gosh, the fact that an emulator which already slows down hardware because you're emulating it.
2103760	2104800	It's very telling.
2104800	2107600	It's not so much any nowadays because it's basically
2108160	2112320	an Android device. And so I mean, it's not hard to emulate that.
2112880	2113380	Yeah, I guess.
2115040	2115540	But yeah.
2115540	2122180	Um, let's see, looking at some other comments in chat. And this is this was the one this was asked
2122180	2127540	way back. But this is definitely the definitive one about where does this gen rank amongst the
2127540	2133380	others for Shane? Well, let me ask that question. Generally, Shane, now that you've beaten this gen,
2134020	2138820	where does it rank amongst the other gens for you? Like what Gen five is still your all time
2138820	2140980	favorite, right? Where does Yeah, where does this land?
2141700	2148900	Well, I haven't like gone through and ranked it based on everything overall. But I did do my handy
2148900	2155860	starter rank thing as soon as all the like leaks came out. And Gen nine ended up being second in
2155860	2163300	terms of starters for me. So I would say probably as a whole, it's going to be up there. It's going
2163300	2169780	to be pretty high because it's it's really fun. I have a great time with it. And playing in the
2169860	2175380	open world with people is a blast to I forgot to say that I last night. Yeah. And we're just
2175380	2181460	running around doing raids and just whatever we wanted. It was really fun. Does it somehow
2181460	2188820	run worse with more people? That might be telling as to why it runs the way it does. I mean,
2188820	2192580	that's actually that's because I was like afraid to do multiplayer because I'm like, if it runs
2192580	2196420	like this now like multiplayer is gonna because you could notice it in sword and shield when
2196420	2200740	you're connected to the internet like some weird it's way different. Okay, that's that's a little
2200740	2205460	bit refreshing to hear actually. So at least it performs on that same level when it's online.
2205460	2209700	Maybe that's something they were trying to fix from last gen. I don't know. So interesting.
2210820	2216180	Another all important question from our chat. As Joe and Hunter Matt asks, Now that we know
2216180	2219380	about Shane's list of favorite Pokemon, because remember, you did that a year ago,
2219380	2224100	we did your definitive ranking. Do any of the new ones crack the top 10?
2224820	2231380	Oh, yeah, I'm sure they do. Like, I love Quaxley's line. I'm trying I don't know,
2231380	2236180	like what's considered a spoiler now that the game is out besides story like our Pokemon.
2236180	2240660	I don't think Pokemon themselves are spoilers. You could say, you know,
2240660	2243940	evolution of first form or whatever. And I think that's fair enough.
2244900	2252580	Um, putting me on the spot for this. I didn't actually prepare anything in terms of like,
2253300	2259620	my thoughts. Oh, low kicks. I love low kicks. It's the little grasshopper that looks like a common
2259620	2267620	writer. He is fantastic. He is an amazing design. Okay. Who's that fire ghost Pokemon that I picked
2267620	2272740	up on stream last night? I forgot the name or a shark shark shark shark board. I don't know what
2272740	2277540	it is. No chart cadet chart cadet. That's it. I like that one. That's a really cool one.
2278180	2282020	Carcadet evolves pretty nicely too. Can't wait to see it.
2282900	2285300	You have if you've seen any of the pre release stuff.
2286340	2292980	Probably, but I'm not going to remember that type of stuff. So all right. Anything else you want to
2292980	2296260	mention about Pokemon Gen nine before we move on with the show?
2297140	2303460	Um, I will say not that it's a big deal, but it probably happened like this in sword and shield
2303540	2309140	and I don't remember but I had not been getting any good raids in terms of star numbers until
2309140	2314900	after I beat the game. So that was a bummer. But now I'm getting four and five star raids,
2314900	2319780	so I'm happy but they're hard. This is not some like sword and shield walk in the park.
2319780	2325140	Oh, interesting. I've been the raids I've seen so far have been kind of disappointing because
2325140	2329540	they're all Pokemon I pretty much already have. I only saw one that was a new Pokemon for me,
2329540	2334580	but I'm early on like it's not fair me to don't don't don't base any opinion about the game on
2334580	2337940	that. It's still early on so but I'm like, all right, well, maybe I'll see something later.
2338500	2342500	So, but I've been streaming pretty much my entire playthrough the game and I think I'm going to
2342500	2346660	continue that I don't usually stream narrative games because I feel like they're very hard to
2346660	2353220	drop in and out of because of the story. I feel like Pokemon is different. That the story is
2353220	2358420	generally pretty similar. Yes, I and I know chain is probably ready to correct me on that with this
2358420	2363940	game. But let's be real at the end of the day, the bulk of the game is catching them all finishing
2363940	2368260	your pokey decks. And I think it's a much easier thing to drop in and out of than say Assassin's
2368260	2374180	Creed Odyssey, or Final Fantasy 15 or something where there is a story going on. And it can
2374180	2378500	sometimes be a little hard to jump into the middle of it, right. So it's made it a little easier to
2378500	2382500	stream. So I'm going to continue to stream my playthrough. I don't see why not. People have
2382500	2386820	been showing up and I've been having fun talking with the crowd. So and, you know, and laughing at
2386820	2391860	the technical glitches together, but at the same time, you know, getting really excited when I see
2391860	2398260	new Pokemon, like I love that. I love the route system being completely demolished. And yeah,
2398260	2402580	I understand that technically there are still section areas and things like that. But I,
2402580	2409460	I love just the concept of the route systems just being gone at this point. And just getting to
2410660	2416260	do I want to go to the gym? Or do I want to see if this dead end has a secret TM or a Pokemon that
2416260	2422020	I don't have yet? Or how do I make that Dunsparce respawn because it's literally the only one I've
2422020	2426980	seen, you know, and things like that. So I don't know, that part's been really fun for me. So
2426980	2432500	I, uh, I did see something on somebody's stream today, which was really cool. So you can eat those
2432500	2438900	sandwiches. That's the cooking mini game this time around. And it's basically used for boosting
2438900	2444420	different aspects of the game. And he's shiny hunting. So he boosts encounter rate. And he was
2444420	2451860	trying to find cyclists are, um, the little motorcycle lizard. And I swear it looked like
2451860	2456500	that scene from Jurassic park where they're like all the dinosaurs come running over the bend and
2456500	2463220	they have to hide under the, like the stump or the tree log. Like that's the kind of like spawn rate
2463220	2468500	that he was getting for like a good five minutes. It was ridiculous looking. Interesting. Are you
2468500	2474020	excited to shiny hunt? Yes and no, because in this game they don't sparkle when they pop up.
2474020	2480420	They don't sparkle until you actually run into them. And, uh, that makes me feel like I'm going
2480420	2485940	to miss one or I've already missed one. Um, because I might not be observant enough and the
2485940	2494180	way things spawn and despawn also is kind of janky. So like on the streamer I was watching,
2494180	2499300	he got thrown into combat. Like one of the cyclists are ran into him and everything in
2499300	2505300	the background still keeps going and a shiny spawned while he was fighting it and it ran away.
2505300	2509940	Oh no. So he did not get it. And I'm like, I don't want that to be me.
2511380	2516020	Oh, that would be so upsetting. Oh, especially to see that, you know?
2517620	2523940	Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, uh, you know, well keep us posted on your Pokemon adventures.
2523940	2528580	We want to, uh, uh, hear how the post game goes. You know, there's going to be DLC for this at
2528580	2532340	some point. There has to be, oh yeah, there will be, there will be no third version. There'll be
2532340	2537060	a DLC. There's like an area that's kind of sectioned off in the upper right part of the map.
2537060	2542660	That's just like a dotted line. People just expect it to be there and sure. Why not? I'm sure it'll
2542660	2546740	be its own little area, you know, kind of, and that's kind of how it was in, um, sword and
2546740	2552420	shield. The DLC were kind of like new wild areas of their own. So yeah. Yeah. I'm sure it'll be
2552420	2556660	like that. All right. Are you gonna stay with us and talk about the rest of the news this week?
2557620	2562100	Um, maybe for a little bit. Yeah. All right. Sounds good. Just let me know when you got to go.
2562100	2566740	Uh, actually let's quickly talk. Cause I, I kind of skipped by it because of the other things that
2566740	2571940	were on my mind, but, um, you know, it is 20 November today, which is a bit of a, um, you know,
2571940	2577060	beep matching, beep meaning a holiday of sorts. Um, you know, and this is what really the 20th
2577060	2581700	year of doing this show. And it's, it's nice that 20 November kind of falls on a Sunday.
2581700	2586500	Um, you know, when I was, I was talking about this a little bit on, on Mastodon today. Cause
2586500	2590580	that's, that's the new thing. Although I understand social media split now. Like there's
2590580	2594020	people that went to hive. There's people who went to co-hosts. There's people who went to Mastodon,
2594020	2600580	like nothing's really like stuck yet. Um, for me, I, I still think a lot of the terminology and the
2600580	2606260	concept of Mastodon is a little difficult, but like, once you kind of get it, you start to like,
2606260	2611700	for me anyway, you start to really appreciate that like Mastodon is like built in a way where
2611700	2617060	nobody can ever single-handedly own it. It is truly something that belongs to the internet,
2617060	2621140	um, for better or for worse. It could be interesting if some bad actors get in there.
2621140	2625220	Uh, it'd be interesting to see how they can like respond to that. But I think again,
2625220	2629220	it'll be community-based solutions and that could be very interesting. Anyway, I digress.
2629220	2633300	Um, I was talking, um, a little bit on, on Mastodon today, um,
2633940	2639060	um, about the fact that, you know, it's, it's 20 November and like, you know, looking back on some
2639060	2644980	of those memories of playing DDR and that sort of thing at the arcade can sort of, uh, sort of
2644980	2651460	bring a smile, uh, when there's a lot of other crap going on in the world. Um, Shane, I know you
2651460	2657860	actually worked at Konami for a while during, uh, some of the better years of DDR and you helped
2657860	2662580	create some stuff on the Xbox games and so forth. Do you have a particular, since it is 20 November,
2662580	2666020	do you have a particular fond memory from those times? I know I'm putting you on the spot a
2666020	2669540	little bit, but do you have a, since, since, you know, there's, there's no more NDA's or
2669540	2673620	anything like that. Do you have a particular fond memory of that time to share with our audience?
2674740	2678420	I'm sure I've shared it before, but one of my favorite memories was when,
2678420	2686260	uh, now he came to this, to, uh, work and we took a picture with him outside and in front
2686260	2691540	of the building and I was wearing a Santa hat and he said, uh, he pointed at it and said Christmas
2691540	2695940	and it just was funny. Like, it's just a neat little anecdote.
2698340	2702740	No, I love it. I love it. Uh, let's see, going in chat. Um,
2704020	2710580	uh, the sparkle is Mike, Mike deaf talking about shiny says the sparkle and sound only appears when
2710580	2715060	you actually go into battle with it. Shane will probably understand this, but that's what we call
2715060	2721060	a coopsie. Yeah, I understand that, but what I don't, what is that? It's a streamer reference.
2721620	2726340	Okay. All right. Uh, Mike Deft also says, but money day and Mexican revolution day. I have
2726340	2731140	tomorrow off. Yay. Uh, dark says, if there's one thing I'll miss about Twitter, it's seeing the
2731140	2736740	Japanese community still celebrating today. Yeah. I understand Twitter is still kind of popular in
2736740	2743860	Japan and it probably let a lot of this news probably lands a lot different, uh, when you,
2743860	2748100	you know, you're speaking a different primary language in a different country. It probably,
2748100	2752980	a lot of these other, you know, bought machines that are looking for English words and English
2752980	2757220	things to hate on. It probably doesn't land all the same in Japan. I would imagine. So, um,
2757220	2763060	I'm glad they're still having a good time over there, I guess. Um, but yeah, thank you for the
2763060	2768100	comments over twitch.tv slash bog network. All right. Let's talk about our gaming weeks. I know
2768100	2772500	we've kind of been talking about Pokemon, but I'm sure there's other games we've been playing too.
2772500	2776100	So let's talk about your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been playing
2776100	2782260	this week. Um, Loki, I'll start with you. How was your gaming week? I played games. I actually
2782260	2788500	played things, not just Minecraft. So, um, go simulator three, obviously, which is in my
2788500	2793220	background right now. So I played about eight hours of that, uh, because it's awesome. It's
2793220	2797940	just kind of a nice game to shut your mind off and just play it. Um, it's kind of a collectathon
2797940	2803380	type thing. And it's like a more polished version of the original goat simulator. I
2803380	2808100	definitely looking forward to when it eventually hits steam and there's mod support added because
2808100	2816260	right now it's on Epic game store and you know, there's something there. Um, but yeah, it's also,
2816260	2822820	um, as I play the game, getting more and more glitched out, which I think is on by design,
2822820	2829460	there's a, um, you get different like cosmetic pieces that you can equip on your goat that
2829460	2835300	do different things. And they kind of had that in the first game. It was more, um, it was less
2835300	2840340	of like an actual cosmetic in the first game and more of like, this is just the rocket goat. This
2840340	2847220	is a go, the double jumps or stuff like that. Um, so now they have one that you can, I guess,
2847220	2856340	make the player heads of like the different, um, people walking around expand and there's no limit
2856340	2867060	to it. And that's funny, but now my NPC spawn of heads that are like enormous that I can't
2867060	2872340	see around sometimes. I don't know why it started spawning them with larger heads outside of the
2872340	2880900	ones I gave larger heads, but it just keeps doing it. So that's kind of funny. Um, and it's silly.
2880900	2887380	There's a bunch of weird, uh, references in the game. There is a silent Hill PT reference.
2887380	2892980	There's a part that you go into that you do PT basically. Um, which is kind of funny. There is
2892980	2899860	a Wolfenstein 3d reference, which is great. There is a counter-strike, um, reference in there as
2899860	2906020	well. Um, at the beginning of the game, the very, very beginning is a Skyrim reference. I mean,
2906020	2910980	there's a lot of like pop culture and like ridiculous references in there. Um, so it is,
2910980	2915380	it's a lot of fun. I've had a lot of fun with it and I think it's on sale there for like 20 bucks
2915380	2921700	too. Um, I, I picked it up for like 40 or whatever, but. You know, I mean, if you want it on a console
2921700	2925540	and stuff, black Friday, it's going to be like half price. So it's certainly worth it for that
2925540	2931780	much. Plus it's also co-op and that's fun. I played co-op with my son. Um, and then aside
2931780	2939780	from that, I played step mania. I started playing on my cabinet again. Um, and so that's fun. I
2939780	2944340	don't know how I didn't know. I mean, I knew it had the mode. I just didn't know how to access it
2944340	2951140	on nonstop mode and set mania. And so I was doing that to try to get through some exercise and stuff.
2951860	2958180	And then of course, as step mania does or even DDR, it's like, oh, it's three regular songs
2958180	2964180	and then a really hard song. That's way too challenging even on like just the medium
2964180	2970180	difficulty. And so that's, you know, that was my life there. Um, but I'm having fun with that as
2970180	2974980	well. And it was weird though. Like, yeah, I mentioned it on Twitter a while back that the
2974980	2980580	cabinet like wasn't working one day, like it kept crashing for some reason. I don't know why.
2981220	2990100	I never did figure out why, but it works now. So cool. Let's hope it stays that way. Um,
2990100	2996660	and then of course, Minecraft, I, like I said, I always spun up a, uh, kind of a modded server.
2996660	3003060	So it's using the crate mod, which has lots of gears and different like steampunky things. Um,
3004100	3009780	along with some other mods thrown in there's like bio mods and whatnot that had different biomes in
3009780	3017220	the game. Uh, one of the things I try to model it after final fantasy six. So there's magic tech
3017220	3023460	armor in there because someone made a magic tech armor, a mod because it's fun and giant parrots
3023460	3028340	that you can ride that are kind of like chocobos. So it's in there as well. So this is going to be
3028340	3032580	kind of separate from my normal like YouTube series stuff that I'm doing. It's more of like
3033140	3039380	kind of a more relaxed, taking a break, um, stream series, or I may make YouTube videos out
3039380	3043220	as well, assuming that OBS wants to actually record my video game play. That'd be fun.
3043940	3050340	Um, but yeah, it was fun. I tried that a little bit today. Uh, one of my other fellow channel
3050340	3054500	64 members, people are joining me for a little bit as well. And he was just kind of hanging out
3054500	3059380	and just doing that. So yeah, I'm looking forward to playing that a lot more. A lot of my content
3059380	3064580	creator folks that I watch doing Minecraft are I've started, you know, create series here and
3064580	3069140	there, and it looks like a lot of fun and I'm always jealous. I don't get to play it. So now
3070100	3075540	nice. All right. Uh, Jamie is passing along her gaming week through our chat right now. Uh,
3075540	3079140	dark soccer has in chat saying I played Minecraft on a steam deck.
3079140	3083940	I'll be curious to hear more, uh, impressions on the steam deck, uh, when you get back. Uh,
3083940	3087700	and also that's it. Dark soccer was playing Minecraft. We're gonna have a collab in the
3087700	3094900	future. We'll see, uh, dead by daylight, of course, cold to the lamb and crazy taxi on
3094900	3100260	iPad OS. So awesome. Um, Shane, what about you? I know we've talked a lot about Pokemon
3100260	3104260	and obviously you played plenty of that this weekend, but what else have you been playing
3104260	3106900	this week? Pokemon didn't come out till Thursday night. So what else?
3107620	3114180	This final fantasy 14 doing raid group stuff. That's literally it.
3114180	3119380	How's the latest content in that game for you? Uh, it's kind of a dry spell already.
3119460	3124900	I'm already done with what I can. And then the rest is just trying to get farther in the raid.
3124900	3132180	And we've been having issues keeping our roster full. So we haven't really made much progress.
3133620	3139460	Yeah. I'm kind of hit a dry, dry spell with 14 myself. So, um, yeah, it's, it is what it is.
3139460	3145220	Uh, there'll be, it's interesting because this time a wow expansion is coming out and they're,
3145220	3148580	they're really trying to move. Oh, wait. Oh, I did try that. Um,
3148580	3155620	cause somebody gifted me the new game. Oh yeah. And it was fun making a dragon.
3155620	3161140	Like that part was pretty neat. And then it played like, wow, that's the rest of that.
3161140	3165860	Well, I heard this weekend, they did like a returning player thing where like,
3165860	3170740	if you ever had an active account, you could play this weekend. But why would they do that
3170740	3177620	this weekend when Pokemon nine came out? Like, why would they do that? I don't know.
3178420	3184020	I would, I honestly, I I'm if, if Pokemon was not a thing this weekend, I would have gone and
3184020	3189860	checked that out. Why not? Um, but, uh, oops, this was not the weekend to do that. So maybe I'll,
3189860	3195380	I'll pay attention and try to do it next time. We'll see. So, um, for my gaming week, obviously
3195380	3199940	I played a lot of Pokemon this weekend. I was out of town for a few days, so I didn't do a lot,
3199940	3203780	a lot of gaming then save for, you know, my trip I talked or my little tour I talked about,
3203780	3207780	which again, I will do, I'll do a better job of explaining that and give you some photos and
3207780	3212340	stuff next week for those that are here live, obviously in the podcast feed, uh, I'll explain
3212340	3217380	it a little better, um, for those watching. But again, uh, you know, obviously a lot happened
3217380	3221860	today and, and I won't, I won't recover the ground, but that's why I'm not doing that tonight.
3221860	3227460	Um, so, uh, but as far as like other games that I played, I did, interestingly enough,
3227460	3234180	I fired up, uh, on Xbox game pass kind of a game I'd played before, but the 1.0 version came out
3234180	3238980	of vampire survivors with like achievements and stuff. And so I was like, Oh, I want to see kind
3238980	3243060	of like where this game sort of ended up. And it wasn't drastically different from what I
3243060	3248340	remember before, but it's still very addicting. Um, if you haven't played vampire survivors,
3248340	3253860	it's pretty cheap and it's on game pass. If you're a game pass person, uh, on PC. And I
3253860	3258420	think it's going to be on Xbox very soon. If it's not already, I know that was some big news is that
3258420	3264820	it's coming to the Xbox console at some point. And it is a very addicting little game. Uh, it's,
3264820	3268660	they call it a rogue-like, but I don't know. It played like, I feel like the survivor thing is
3268660	3273620	now its own kind of genre because there are a million knockoffs of this game. But now I feel
3273620	3279700	like some of the knockoff games are starting to gain almost more steam than vampire survivors.
3279700	3283540	There's one, I was watching a friend play on Twitch. I think soul survivors. It is,
3283540	3288740	which is the same concept basically, but like, you know, crisper graphics and kind of like some
3288740	3292660	different things going on there. And now I'm like, Oh, I kind of want to check that game out. That's
3292660	3297620	an early access right now. So, uh, yeah, it was, I was having fun playing some vampire survivors.
3297620	3300900	I've also been playing a little bit of dead by daylight, but I'm going to be honest. I'm,
3300900	3306740	I'm not as like, I kind of feel like that game's really at a low point right now, but just in time,
3306740	3311460	they're releasing a new killer and survivor on Tuesday. So that'll be nice. The game really
3311460	3316580	needs that. But what the game really needs is some of the rebalancing that they were testing.
3316580	3319540	Like, you know, I don't want to get too into the weeds, but they were talking about adding this
3319540	3325460	mechanic called, um, uh, basically unbreakable base kit. So one of the talents unbreakable
3325460	3330260	being base kit for most survivors, uh, for all survivors, but like not exactly the same way
3330260	3334500	that the talent works, but being able to pick yourself up off the ground so that killers can't
3334500	3338740	just like leave you there. Uh, that would be, that's something the game really needs right
3338740	3344740	now. Cause there's just a lot of killers that are just playing desperate and I get that the
3344740	3349700	goal is to win and so forth, but yeah, it would be nice to have some, some more mechanics in the
3349700	3353860	game to even up the tables a little bit, so to speak. So I just think dead by daylight just
3353860	3360260	needs a little bit of a floof right now. So, uh, I'm hoping to get, see, see that. So, um,
3360660	3364740	um, yeah, dark soccer says Nick was on that. Yeah. I think he's who I was watching for a
3364740	3368740	little bit playing that it looks really, uh, looks really, really cool. So I need to check
3368740	3375220	that game out, but Pokemon happens. So that's kind of at the front of my gaming menu, uh,
3375220	3379380	for the foreseeable future. I I'll probably stick with it till I beat it, which is more than I can
3379380	3384980	say for most Pokemon games, except what, fuck even sword and shield. I didn't beat for a year.
3384980	3389700	Remember that like it first came out and I was like, eh, and then like, I tried it again and I
3389700	3393940	just kind of went in with a different mindset and it clicked for me the second time. And I,
3393940	3399380	I played all the way to the end. So I think this one though, I'll stick with until I beat it,
3399380	3404820	unless there's like a really annoying thing. I can't get past. Do you think, uh, Shane,
3404820	3408260	do you think there's going to be anything in this game where I'm going to get annoyed and want to
3408260	3416500	quit? Uh, only the graphical glitches. I mean, I don't know if that's going to really bother you
3416500	3423380	otherwise, as long as you realize you might not be going to a gym or a Titan or whatever, that
3423940	3429300	is the right level. And you might need to research where to go. Um, then you'll be fine.
3429300	3433380	How do you search where to go? Like, are you just talking about the internet or are you talking
3433380	3439380	about the internet? Okay. I thought maybe in game there was hints. Uh, there are somewhat hints,
3439380	3445060	uh, in the descriptions of each place, like this is like the medium difficulty sort of thing,
3445060	3450100	but then you have to infer, well, how far up is the medium difficulty versus the one that says
3450100	3457540	it's the lowest difficulty and what's in between those. Um, but honestly, if you just will explore
3457540	3463860	a little bit, you will be fine. It's, it's not that bad though. Again, going out of order was
3463860	3468500	rough for me. And, uh, I was surprised how difficult some of those fights got because I
3468500	3474500	went out of order. Okay. Interesting. Yeah. I, I usually tend to like try to out level, you know,
3474500	3478820	like grind the Pokemon and really out level the battles. But one thing I noticed about the badges
3478820	3486180	is that they're not like level 20, 30, 40, 50 anymore. It's 20, 25, 30. I'm assuming 35. So
3486180	3490180	they're in increments of five levels and I'm kind of like, okay, well I could see how, so I just
3490180	3497620	beat the second gym so I can, uh, get up to level 25, I think to a baby, no level 30. Now I don't
3497620	3503220	even know. I have to research this, but the wording they use seems different than normal.
3503300	3511620	It sounds like Pokemon that you catch in the wild, uh, up to that level will obey you. But if you,
3511620	3516740	if they were like Pokemon you already had and they go above that level, I think they'll still obey
3516740	3521140	you regardless. Oh, interesting. Okay. Well that's good. But still it is, it is some kind of like,
3523060	3527540	that's the only thing where I'm like, okay, I feel like I need to do that because I could see how
3527540	3533300	like I end up in a gym and the Pokemon at the gym are level 45 and I can't even train my Pokemon
3533300	3539540	that high. Like that's a telltale sign that I'm at the wrong place. Right. So yeah. Um, we'll see.
3540180	3546020	I'm sure I'll be fine. Uh, okay. Uh, that's it for our gaming weeks. So let us move on. Let's
3546020	3550980	get into some of the gaming news that happened around the industry this week. So Loki, I will
3550980	3561220	start with you. Yep. Um, so we had some news regarding, um, gearbox and some of the acquisitions
3561220	3565940	that they're making. So this was interesting. The first one, of course, that caught my attention was
3565940	3573380	that, uh, volition has moved from deep silver to gearbox. How quickly deep silver purchase volition
3573380	3582100	and is that, nah, we don't want that anymore. Um, so now they're going to be a subsidiary of
3582100	3592020	gearbox. Um, I hope that means better games for sure. Uh, well, how is that going to mean better
3592020	3595860	games? Do you think that means that there'll be given the space and time to do it? Or what do you,
3595860	3601300	what do you think went wrong that maybe this can correct? They need to replace the team that makes
3601300	3606020	the game. Honestly, they just need to gut volition and just have gearbox put out saints for a game.
3606020	3613060	So, I mean, to be honest, like they're, they're so confident in their inability to do things. Like,
3613060	3618660	it's just, I think, I don't know if there's much to be saved at this point from them. I'm sure
3618660	3623380	that there's developers that are pretty nice. I don't know what they need. Cause that game was
3623380	3630580	delayed a few times and it still ended up like hot garbage. So it's not time it's talent. I think,
3632260	3635780	management usually tends to be the management. Yeah. I mean, uh,
3635780	3639700	I'm sure there's plenty of talented artists, et cetera, that are not the problem for sure.
3639700	3645140	I hope writing, I know gearbox, like, especially with like some of the borderlands games,
3645140	3650740	those have pretty decent stories in them. Although the last, the three wasn't as strong as like two,
3650740	3658500	but it's still miles above what, uh, saints row was. So like, maybe they can share some
3658500	3663620	other writing staff or something would be nice. Uh, technically the borderlands games are well
3663620	3671060	put together versus what we have in, um, saints row. So I think at the very least sharing the
3671060	3675620	resources or sharing development teams or something like that could only help. I mean,
3675620	3680340	it's only, they can only, I can't say they only can go up from here because they could go,
3680340	3686020	they could become worse, but, um, I'm hoping that under a new direction that it will end up working
3686020	3693540	out better for them. So I hope to see something from that. Um, also they have announced that
3694420	3701380	gearbox studio Shanghai is going to be coming. And so it was formerly Eidos Shanghai, but now
3701380	3707620	it's going to represent gearbox entertainment. And, um, so that's pretty cool. I'm not sure
3707620	3712900	exactly what they're going to be working on right now, but, uh, producing more content from,
3713780	3718100	you know, the area they said, uh, China is a hotbed of industry talent and I'm confident
3718100	3723860	that gearbox studio Shanghai will be instrumental in our vision for international growth here at
3723860	3732660	gearbox. So cool. Um, and then, uh, last but not least, they've also acquired the risk of rain
3732660	3739060	of franchise. So that's a pretty awesome roguelike game. And, um, so now they have that under their
3739060	3747780	belt as well with, um, Papu Papu games. It'll be interesting to see what they kind of use all
3747780	3752420	this to make in the coming, in the, in the future, you know, cause I'm sure they'll take some of the
3752420	3756980	talent with the saints row and maybe shuffle it up and put it on some other games. It'll be
3756980	3761940	interesting. Yeah. I mean, kind of seeing like what risk of rain, if I was to combine risk of
3761940	3769540	rain and volition together, it, I mean, that basically gets me, um, oh gosh, I want to say
3769540	3774660	red faction. I don't remember if that was their, their game, their Mars, like game that was kind of
3774660	3782180	like that. I don't remember if that was the name of it or not, but, um, yeah. I mean, cool. I'm
3782180	3787940	excited. Let's see what they come up with. It's funny you say red faction because that is in
3787940	3793300	chat. Hi, is that good to see you. And is that is reminding me of something else that I played
3793300	3796740	this weekend that I completely forgot to talk about what wasn't this weekend, but like literally
3796740	3802100	like all week. So, um, but it's because I always play these games. So it's, it's like Loki and
3802100	3808500	Minecraft. It's, it's me and Ingress and Pokemon go and all this stuff. So there was a big live
3808500	3813460	event in Ingress in LA and I wasn't able to go because I was in Seattle at the same time,
3814100	3819540	but long story short, what happened after the event is that they introduced a new mechanic
3819540	3825300	into the game that there's a lot of mystery about. And it's this always rumored third faction got
3825300	3828740	introduced into the game. And no, it's not something that players could just switch to.
3828740	3832900	If you don't know the basics of Ingress, which was the game that Niantic made before Pokemon go,
3832900	3837460	which is where a lot of your Poke stops and gyms came from, uh, it's a much more player versus
3837460	3841620	player type of game where you pick either the enlightened or the resistance green team or blue
3841620	3845940	team, basically. And for years and years and years, there's been rumors about a red faction
3845940	3850420	and people that I think, I think they just don't like their own team and they don't like the other
3850420	3855460	team. So I think there's a lot of people that are wanting a third place to go. Um, which guess what
3855460	3859380	that third team would suffer from all the same problems. So, you know, it is what it is, but
3859380	3866900	it's interesting because, uh, once the event in LA was over a portal at Dodger Stadium nearby,
3866900	3871300	which was inaccessible, you couldn't get in there because Dodger Stadium is closed,
3871300	3875940	unless there's something going on, a portal in there went red. And so it made a lot of
3875940	3881140	questions like what's going on. And so now a red faction has shown up into the game. It is
3881140	3887380	basically an NPC faction is what we know at this time. The interesting thing is a few of these
3887380	3894100	portals went live around the time. The inaccessible one at the Dodger Stadium went live. One of the
3894100	3902020	other portals happened to show up at the Space Needle. And guess where I was at a hotel two
3902020	3908260	blocks away from the Space Needle. So when I heard that this was going on, I actually ended up being
3908260	3913860	one of the first players. I actually recorded video and had to send it. Well, I didn't have to,
3913860	3918180	but I sent it to people that were on my team that were trying to investigate what the hell is going
3918180	3923620	on. Because not only was the Space Needle a red portal, but it was starting to link
3924180	3929620	and create other red portals. And so it was the first time I think the Space Needle was the first
3929620	3936020	portal that actually started linking to other portals. So I was like, and how often in your
3936020	3942580	life are you going to say this? Alan, I got to be right back. I need to go and blow up the Space
3942580	3952500	Needle in a game, in a game, in a game. So I did. I went and I pew pew pew laser beams in my video
3952500	3957380	game, the Space Needle and the surrounding portals and, you know, sent off the video and
3957380	3962660	all that stuff. And that was, that was kind of neat to do that. Yeah. As that said, he ran to
3962660	3966100	get it in the middle of the night. It was, it was like 10 o'clock at night over there when that
3966100	3971620	happened. So yeah, all we know is that there is a third faction in the game. Makina is the name of
3971620	3976340	it, because now there's a stat that tracks it. There has been teased for a little while. And one
3976340	3982660	of the creative minds with Ingress did an interview with GameSpot, I think it was. This is actually the
3982660	3985700	10th anniversary of Ingress, believe it or not. So the game's been out for 10 years. I mean,
3985700	3990740	Pokemon Go has been out for six. So it's probably not too surprising that Ingress has been out for
3990740	3996900	10 years. And they've actually been talking about that a PvE element is something they're looking
3996900	4003540	to add to the game. And so I think this red faction is the PvE element. How it really is
4003540	4007780	going to work, we still don't know. There's a lot of question marks about it. But there is another
4007780	4014500	live event in Japan in December 10. And that is the culmination of the current series. So it's
4014500	4018900	expected we're going to know a lot more about what's going on once the Japanese event is over
4018900	4023860	on December 10. So anyway, just a quick aside. A little weird. I don't know how they're going
4023860	4030260	to implement that because that's just like, Oh, hey, I'm feeling Oh, and it this NPC thing
4030260	4035140	knocked out. Well, that Well, here's the interesting thing. So far anyway, the NPC is
4035140	4041380	only taking over neutral portals. It isn't attacking other player portals. But because
4041380	4048980	it is linking, it is able to block other links. And the red faction has been observed, they do
4048980	4055220	not observe the rule of being able to throw links over existing links. So this has a lot of fielders
4055220	4064020	very nervous, because the red faction can fuck up. Well, yeah, yeah. But so far, I think, you know,
4064020	4070340	a lot of the massive fielding happened usually happens in really rural areas. And it doesn't
4070340	4074100	seem like the red faction can link very far. Again, there's a lot of details we just don't
4074100	4078420	know. This element in the game is like it's one of those things that Ingress does. It's a mystery.
4078420	4083140	It's up to the player base to figure it out and investigate. And that's why I had to take a video
4083140	4087700	of what it looks like when you attack the portals. And because this was the first time it was learned
4087700	4092660	about how linked behavior would work. And one thing we learned from this is that because there
4092660	4097220	was a red portal that was linked to the space needle that I didn't go kill because it was a few
4097220	4101380	blocks away. And I was like, it's cold, I'm not walking all the way over there. That portal ended
4101380	4107060	up disintegrating on its own. So that was something that that experiment kind of learned is that
4107620	4113700	if the portal doesn't stay linked to the nerve center, it might decay and pass away on its own.
4113700	4118020	So this is it's a weird thing. So anyway, yeah, I don't want to get too into the weeds of Ingress
4118020	4123620	because I know not everyone plays it. But I don't think it's going to mess with the massive fields
4123620	4128500	and the teamwork type of thing. But it is going to be very interesting to see how this takes over
4128500	4136180	rural areas because it's happening right now. Nearby for us, Lodi, you know, the town of Lodi,
4136180	4141140	right? It's a more rural area. There's really nobody that plays regularly in Lodi. Well, guess
4141140	4147460	what? There is huge red faction activity out in Lodi Lake right now, which is a walking trail down
4147460	4154180	there. And I can't really go down there easily because it gets dark at 430 now and the lake
4154180	4159300	closes at dark and I have to work. So it's like, it's, yeah, it's interesting to see what happens.
4159300	4166500	But the other interesting thing, look at Moscow. Ironically, Ingress is unplayable in Russia right
4166500	4171460	now. Niantic shut the game down in Russia when a lot of other companies shut down their services
4171460	4176180	in Russia because of what's going on in Ukraine. So if you actually look at the map in Moscow right
4176180	4184420	now, it is very, very red, which I know, insert your own, you know, red jokes about Russia. But
4184420	4189060	like the reality is, as far as the game mechanic goes, it's interesting to see what happens when
4189060	4195380	literally nobody can do anything about it. I'm not sure if the developers thought that one through.
4196660	4200420	But we'll see. We'll see what they will see. We'll see where the story goes. I don't know.
4201060	4207220	Breaking entertainment news. Oh, good or bad. It's not even very video game related.
4207860	4215460	Bob Chapek is out of Disney. He got replaced just tonight with Bob Iger again.
4215460	4223060	Let's celebrate. Let's celebrate good times. Come on. Because you know what?
4223060	4228180	Disneyland is a fucking disaster right now. So as that and that's probably the reason why he
4228180	4238660	got the axe. And to that I say good fucking riddance. Goodbye. I mean, lol at Bob Iger coming back
4238660	4246340	again. But I mean, it can't be any worse. So that is interesting. Entertainment news. Thank you for
4246340	4251940	sharing that. Interesting. Tiger Claw just dropped the link in chat. So yeah, other comments in chat.
4251940	4259220	Let's see. DJ Roma SS. Oh shit. Dark soccer says Oh, Mike Deaf says for the freaking best. Yep.
4259220	4264980	Pretty much. Pretty much. All right. Thank you. Thank you for the late breaking news.
4265780	4270580	You're welcome. That you know, even though Disney doesn't super get involved with video games
4270580	4274500	anymore, they don't have an in house development studio. There has been that talk about how they're
4274500	4278740	willing to license out IPS and for things that aren't just Kingdom Hearts. So it'll be interesting
4278740	4286820	to see how that attitude maybe evolves or doesn't under back under Bob Iger, I guess so. All right.
4287460	4295060	Moving on. This is very interesting what's happened here. Yuji Naka, you know that name,
4295060	4302420	right? He co created legendary franchise Sonic, legendary franchise Balan Wonder World,
4302420	4309620	I was gonna say Sonic and less legendary. Far more legendary. Wait, are you a fan of Balan
4309620	4315860	Wonder World? No, I think it's a terrible game. But it's like, it's infamous and how bad it is.
4315860	4322020	So I think it's like the show. It's more known than Yeah, it's the what the show girls. It's
4322020	4326660	so bad. Like it has a reputation. I've never seen that still. Really, you should you should change
4326660	4331140	that someday. No, you won't like it. I already know you. You don't appreciate bad movies. Like,
4331140	4336420	is there you say is it's a bad movie, but you enjoy it. There's like a lot of 80s movies that
4336420	4343140	are bad that I enjoy. I feel like, like horror, like I wouldn't say those. I will I wouldn't say
4343140	4350260	like better off dead is a great movie, but I love it. But it's just it's it's 80s cheese.
4350260	4355780	What about a similar sounding but very different movie drop dead Fred? That was an 80s movie that
4355780	4363780	is my cousin's terrible. I never I never watched it. I just know the chick from Gremlins is in it.
4365620	4371780	All right. Oh, dark soccer says that was 90s. It must have been that kind of late 80s early 90s
4371780	4377380	period that tech is technically Paula Abdul. I think forever your girl was 1990 album,
4377380	4381620	but a lot of people associate her the 80s. So it's that it's that kind of like that in between
4381620	4388500	period. So anyway, maybe an 89 album. Anyway, but back to Yuji Naka, who did co create Sonic,
4388500	4393380	which obviously Sonic had its own huge game recently. I actually was curious to check it out
4393380	4398820	Sonic frontiers. I it's just it released at a bad time because I'm really all about Pokemon now.
4399620	4404340	But I'll be curious, especially if it goes on sale, to pick up Sonic frontiers. I'm curious
4404340	4409460	enough. Oh, I saw it place already had it on sale. I think for like 40 as like, that's not a good
4409460	4413540	sign. But I think it was also just a random sale. So I didn't really read anything. Well,
4413540	4416660	I'll be curious what happens with Black Friday, because you know, some of the gaming sales are
4416660	4422260	already starting for Black Friday. And like Gotham Knights is on the PlayStation Black Friday sale
4422260	4427700	that game just fucking came out. So I'm curious what else that's so recent, we'll start to get
4427700	4432340	discounted already. It'll be interesting. Seriously, don't buy any new games until Friday,
4432340	4437460	if you can stand it don't except for Pokemon. Well, yeah. Well, Nintendo games never go on
4437460	4444660	sale. So that is the exception. All right. Anyway, and yes, game free games are Nintendo games,
4444660	4449220	as far as I'm concerned. All right. Back to Yuji Naka. What happened to Yuji Naka? Well,
4449220	4453780	you can read it on the sidebar there for those on the podcast feed. Apparently he's been arrested.
4454420	4461060	And this has to go with ongoing Square Enix insider trading investigation. Also arrested
4461060	4468180	from Square Enix employees Taisuke Suzuki and Fumiaki Suzuki. Apparently they acquired stock
4468180	4474420	in the game development company Square Enix, aiming prior to the announcement of the Dragon
4474420	4481940	Quest title on mobile Dragon Quest tacked. So this has to do with maybe potentially allegedly
4481940	4487780	having advanced knowledge of a Dragon Quest mobile game. And you know that if you have
4487780	4491860	insider secrets about what a company is doing, it's illegal to be traded. This is what Martha
4491860	4499620	Stewart went to jail for. Long story short. So this is allegedly what's happening. Allegedly
4499620	4507380	Suzuki and Suzuki purchased 47 million yen that's about $300,000 in the developer aiming who is
4507380	4513220	making the game for Square Enix. Yuji Naka apparently purchased 10,000 shares of aiming
4513220	4519140	stock for about $20,000 before the same announcement. In a statement Square Enix has said,
4519140	4523540	we deeply regret the great concern this has caused to all concerned. We have dealt with
4523540	4528500	this incident strictly including internal disciplinary actions taken against the suspected
4528500	4533300	employees. Well, Yuji Naka left Square Enix a long time ago. So I'm assuming that statement
4533300	4540580	is about the other two. But Yuji Naka ironically also in a lawsuit case with Square Enix right now
4540580	4544420	because he was removed from the game about half a year before the release. And you might remember
4544420	4550180	he's trying to fault all the problems with that game on him getting fired and basically not being
4550180	4557620	able to fix the problems in Square Enix releasing the game anyway. So interesting story. Tiger
4557620	4562900	Kalan Chat says the news about Yuji Naka being arrested was wild news for the Sonic community.
4562900	4568820	Well, yeah. Imagine if Miyamoto got arrested tomorrow. You know, like, Nintendo fans would
4568820	4576020	be like, the fuck? Like that's that's what it is to Sonic in many ways. So it's it's this is a big
4576020	4582260	deal, especially for folks in that fandom. Is it going to change the future of the franchise?
4583220	4589860	Not really. I think Yuji Naka was already pretty disconnected from things. It takes team upon
4589860	4596260	teams upon teams of people to build these games at this point. But it's it's weird. You know,
4596260	4604100	and it sucks to see the people that you idolize allegedly participating in in crappy things. But
4604100	4613300	you know, anyway. All right. Yeah, Dr. Sia says I was WTF when I heard this one. Yeah, for sure.
4613300	4618180	It's it is. It's wild news. Wild news. All right. Moving on. Loki, what do you have for us?
4619940	4626020	Yeah, so remember, we heard rumors for quite a while that they were going to be doing an Xbox
4626020	4634100	Game Pass streaming box. And kind of, you know, I think even people saw it in the back of it. Was
4634100	4640580	it that I remember Phil Spencer? Phil Spencer? Yes. He always hides stuff or allegedly hide stuff
4640580	4649380	in his office. He does it. He's been caught doing it. Anyways, so yeah, they were going to do
4649460	4654820	something like that. But unfortunately, it became too cost prohibitive. They said that their Xbox
4654820	4660180	Keystone was starting to get close in price to the Xbox Series S. And at that point, it's like,
4660900	4665060	why even bother, you know, because you would be cutting into your own sales at that point.
4666180	4671140	They wanted to announce that they, you know, basically said that it had to be something
4671140	4677540	around like 129 or 99 somewhere in that ballpark to make sense. But it was starting to get closer
4677540	4685700	to, you know, 200, $300. So at that point, it's just like, you know, they can't do it. But
4686740	4692020	it's fine. I guess you buy a Series X or Series S then or something else. I mean,
4692020	4695780	it helps sell the system for sure. And that's what E3VL in chat says. So a
4695780	4700660	downgraded Series S, I mean, in some way, I mean, you still have to have access to the internet in
4700660	4705940	the cloud. So it's not even a device that would work everywhere. But ironically, it's the kind
4705940	4710820	of thing I could see being a really good device, you know, like in Japan, where there is a lot more
4710820	4714740	cloud gaming, you see the streaming games on the switch and things like that. So it could have been
4714740	4720020	very interesting for that. But it's also like something to like when, like the same thing that
4720020	4725140	happened with, you know, the stadia or something like that, where you have this device for the
4725140	4729940	service, and then what happens when that service goes away? And sincerely, you know, you've got
4729940	4735780	doorstop there. So it's almost like, you know, with the S or something like that, it would make
4735780	4741620	more sense, because the release there, you could, you know, make purchases and stuff like that,
4741620	4747300	I don't know, they could be, it wouldn't really make sense for them to have that unless they
4747300	4752100	could get the price to point where it's like one of those Roku streaming sticks or something like
4752100	4756740	that, you know, we can get the hardware down to that. But it's just not possible.
4757700	4762900	By the way, speaking of cloud based gaming, and I can't wait until she's back to talk to her about
4762900	4767300	this. But remember, we had a we had an in depth conversation with dark soccer when the news about
4767300	4773620	stadia came out, right. So those stadia refunds are going out right now. And dark soccer in chat
4773620	4783060	right now says, I got 3500 I got my stadia refund. Oh, well, right. I knew that's like tax return
4783060	4788980	money. I know that's that. But it's that's, I mean, look, look, no one has any room to judge,
4788980	4793540	we all spend a lot of money on video games. That's, that's not what it's about. But it's like
4793540	4799940	getting that much money back. And the fact that Google actually refunded that much, and like
4799940	4807860	didn't have a cap is actually kind of like, wow. Like dark soccer's last two years of gaming,
4807860	4812020	Google has now paid her has been re she's been reimbursed for like the last two years of her
4812020	4818100	gaming career from Google PlayStation five money right there. Right. That's right. I feel like with
4818100	4827700	3500. Like, you can build your own cloud machine. I mean, yeah, good. That's like eight Nintendo
4827700	4832260	switches. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And you know something about that. Imagine if Nintendo refunded switch
4832260	4840100	money. Ironically, that's how many switches it take the run Pokemon. Yeah, pretty much.
4840580	4847380	Um, and dark dark soccer says I keep all my DLC on DVD. Yeah, that's that literally dark soccer's
4847380	4852020	last two years of gaming has been paid for. And if a lot of us added up what we spent on games
4852020	4856660	over the last two years, keep in mind dark soccer was all in on stadia. So if you're sitting here
4856660	4862660	going that is a lot of money. Well, why don't you add up you if you buy one game every month,
4862660	4869620	you spent $600 in a month, that's no DLC or it's one game every month, you spending $1200 in two
4869620	4875380	years. So essentially, she got all the DLC for free, though. Yep. Yeah, she nice. Google has
4875380	4880500	comped her gaming for the past two years. See, this is what it feels like to get big. This is
4880500	4888500	this is what it feels like to be one of those big name streamers. For you. You take that 3500 and
4888500	4894500	spend it on lotto tickets. Just kidding. Don't do that would not be good. She would never do that.
4894500	4905060	All right. Anyway, let's move on. And let's talk about Oh, the game awards are on their way. It's
4905060	4909620	that time of year. The game awards are always one of those things. I feel like they don't leave a
4909620	4915700	lot of weeks to hype the game awards. Like the nominees get announced and then like, two three
4915700	4919220	weeks later, the awards happen. And I think that's what it is because the awards are what they're on
4919220	4924260	December 7. So it's only like a three week gap between the announcement of the nominees and the
4924260	4931300	actual ceremony. So you can vote on the official website. You can also vote on discord. That's a
4931300	4936420	really clever way to get them to to get you to get in because they know a lot of people are using
4936420	4940820	discord now. It's not just like Twitter going to hell and things like this. It's you know,
4940820	4945460	discord is really, really gaining amongst gamers. I think that's a very clever thing to do. But
4945460	4951860	remember, read the fine print with the game awards. There's a very good reason they don't let the
4951860	4957540	community have the sole voice on these awards. Because the community would pick wrong every time
4957540	4963860	I guarantee I guarantee like, and you might you might be like, that's an awfully mean and short
4963860	4970820	vision thing. No, it's not. Case in point. Look at what the eccentric asshole just did on Twitter.
4971540	4981780	Bots will ruin everything because some gaming fans with a one track mind are real pieces of work.
4981780	4987780	So we should be thankful that the fan vote is limited to 10%. And the rest of now that so the
4987780	4994180	fan vote can kind of break a tie. But most of it is being done by a panel adjourn a jury vote and
4994180	4999700	things like that of experts. So anyway, the nominees were announced. Here are the nominees
4999700	5010260	for Game of the Year. A Plague Tale Requiem. Elden Dring. God of War Ragnarok. Horizon Forbidden West.
5011220	5017780	Stray. And Xenoblade Chronicles 3. I think Elden Ring has that. That's what it should be,
5017780	5022820	in my opinion. I think God of War Ragnarok is going to take it. And I know there's some
5022820	5027220	controversy behind that. I just feel like the reception I've seen to that game, it got more
5027220	5030900	nominees than any other game. It actually was nominated more times than Elden Ring.
5031860	5035700	I just have this funny feel but it is it is absolutely between those two.
5036340	5043380	It's it's none of those other games have a chance. Sorry. But it is absolutely between those two.
5043380	5051380	I would say that. So, um, but interesting. I mean, you know, it's also kind of what if to me that
5051380	5057300	makes it an interesting year because I'm kind of like, there's no surprise indie darling title
5057300	5061780	that kind of gets in there that actually has a chance. No, that actually has a chance is the
5061780	5066500	rest of my sentence. Yes, Stray got nominated. That's great. But it's not gonna win.
5068420	5075780	It's not worth. No, it's a good game. But it's not game of the year material. Yeah. And to me,
5076900	5081860	to me, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is kind of the surprise in there. Not bad. I'm just saying
5081860	5086900	there's always a Nintendo title in there. I'm just a little bit like, oh, I'm actually surprised
5086900	5092740	that game is getting the recognition because usually those games don't and so I'm kind of I'm
5092740	5097460	pleasantly surprised at that one. No, I haven't played it myself. So I have no horse in that race
5097460	5101540	or I can say that was a good decision. That was a bad decision. Just generally the Xenoblade games
5101540	5105060	in general. I'm just kind of like, oh, that's interesting that that one got put in there amongst
5105060	5111380	the other games as like the Nintendo option this year. It is interesting to me. It's interesting
5111380	5117060	that Pokemon Legends, and you'll notice I'm saying that and not Pokemon 9. It's interesting
5117060	5121620	that Pokemon Legends was not the game that got in there as game of the year to me. Or didn't
5121620	5127780	Splatoon come out this year too? Yeah, but I don't I don't think Splatoon 3 was. I think that was
5127780	5131460	nominated in other categories. I'll have to look at the list. But I don't think it was going to be
5131460	5138020	game of the year. It was to the average jurist. They're going to look at it and say it's too
5138020	5142900	derivative of part two to necessitate a nomination. And yes, I already know what you're
5142900	5148740	thinking. God of War Ragnarok is just a sequel to it. It's different. I can't explain it.
5148740	5155460	Look at the Oscars. It's a very similar type of thing. But Shane, I'm curious your thoughts about
5155460	5161060	like Pokemon Legends or Pokemon 9 not being in the running there as the supreme Pokemon fan here
5161060	5167540	at VOG Network. Well, Scarlet and Violet I don't think came out during like this specific period
5167620	5172580	that the games have to be released in. So not that I would think it would go on there anyway
5173700	5181220	just because of how these awards work. But also I don't think Legends made it because it's not
5181220	5186100	a lot of people consider it like a side game even though it's considered a mainline game.
5186100	5192260	And I don't think they would give any time of day to a side game for a game of the year nomination.
5193220	5202020	Plus, you know, it's I would say it's not as it doesn't have the same broad appeal that these
5202020	5206740	other games do. Like it's not, it's it's sold really well. It still sells really well. But
5206740	5212340	it's not your God of Wars. It's not like the short time that Elden Ring has been out. It's
5212340	5217780	it doesn't have that same sort of buzz. It's for one specific group of people where the other games
5217780	5224100	reach different groups. I will say Pokemon Legends did get nominated in the best role playing
5224100	5229620	category. Now Elden Ring is also in that category. So it's a done deal. But yeah, what I think is
5229620	5233940	interesting about that category, not just the Legends nomination, but also in role playing,
5233940	5241140	a live alive is nominated this year. Oh, random. It is like, is it just is it just there because
5241140	5245700	we finally got it over here? Well, that's the only reason because it has to be that's a great
5245700	5250180	question to be honest. And that's why I'm kind of like, oh, that's interesting. But I think it also
5250180	5256180	really bodes well for the Square Enix wanting to go back and redo old, you know, potentially
5256180	5260820	Enix properties as well as Square Super Nintendo games. I think this all but cements we're going
5260820	5267060	to see another one. So, you know, just just how well this has been received by the public I think
5267060	5271220	is this is really a sign of. So that's very interesting. Some of the other categories that
5271220	5277220	are always interesting to me are things like the best ongoing game because these are games that
5277220	5280980	are already out. But the award acknowledges that this is still, you know, a game that's doing,
5280980	5286260	you know, very well for the community. Apex Legends, Destiny 2, who I feel like is nominated
5286260	5292340	every year. Final Fantasy 14, I also feel like it's nominated every year, rightfully so. Fortnite,
5292340	5297860	completely unsurprising to be quite honest. Genshin Impact, I kind of think Genshin's the
5298500	5303620	the dark horse in that race. My heart is with Final Fantasy 14, of course, but I feel like
5303620	5308260	I feel like an Apex or a Genshin Impact kind of sneaks in there this year and grabs that award,
5308260	5314740	but we'll see. We'll see. Best Performance is also worth noting. I like that they call it
5314740	5319380	Best Performance because as we've been learning more and more in the gaming industry, it's not
5319380	5326660	just voice acting. It's also mocap for a lot of games now. Ashley Birch from Horizon Forbidden
5326660	5332740	West, Sharlik McBurney from A Plague Tale Requiem, Christopher Judge from God of War Ragnarok,
5332740	5338980	Sunny Soljek also from God of War Ragnarok, and Man and Gage also, or excuse me, from Immortality
5338980	5343940	are the nominees in that category this year. It's interesting they don't split it into like major
5343940	5349220	role, minor role, or anything like that. Interesting. There's just one kind of catch-all
5349220	5354020	category, but that is interesting. I just say like, where did this A Plague's Tale,
5354980	5359460	like, overwhelming love come from? Because I've heard of the first one and I kind of
5359460	5364820	heard of the second one, but getting so many nominations just feels really out of left field
5364820	5370020	to me. It might be a good game. I haven't played it. I've watched Dreamer play it. It looked,
5370020	5374340	it looked nice. Like the graphics were very good and I'm just assuming it has a really
5374340	5382100	compelling story to it. So yeah, it just, it just seems like the, not the indie darling that they
5382180	5388020	have to put on the list, but like maybe the title that they put on there to show that they only,
5388020	5396180	they don't only take the biggest name titles for their nominations. But I do hear it's good. I just,
5396180	5399620	I've never heard anything about it. I don't even know what gameplay style it is.
5400500	5406260	DJ Roma S in chat says, I call bullshit on God of War. Orange Wright says, God of War Ragnarok
5406260	5410820	just came out. Deft is talking about his phone call on Bobby's show earlier tonight where like,
5410820	5416820	I don't mind the nomination, but SIFU being considered best fighting game is, is ridiculous.
5417700	5421300	And then DJ Roma S says, dude, that game just came out. It's a slap in the face of the other
5421300	5425140	contenders. Here's the thing. And I know this isn't the popular answer Rama, but it's just,
5425140	5431780	I'm just going to break it down. It's like the Oscars. This, the same thing happens in the Oscars
5431780	5436580	all the time. And the, and the game awards are absolutely going to be at this point.
5436580	5442900	The Oscars get to this point where it is literally a campaign season and the movie doesn't get wide
5442900	5452340	release until January or February, even though the cutoff is in December 31st. And it like movies
5452340	5458500	that get nominated for Oscars almost all of the time release in like one theater in LA that all
5458500	5462420	of the industry people end up seeing. So, so regular people like you and me don't end up seeing
5462420	5469140	it like for one weekend just to be Oscar eligible. And then the entire push is around the awards that
5469140	5476900	it receives. Like this is an industry game in the movie area. And I, what I see with God of War
5476900	5483140	Ragnarok here in part, I think is kind of that, but I actually don't think that's on the developers.
5483140	5488580	The reality is the game awards are just timed really weird because yes, for ever since the
5488580	5494020	beginning of time in this industry, big releases are always around Thanksgiving. They want to get
5494020	5499300	on the shelves before Black Friday. We all know that's when the games release. So really, I think,
5499300	5503300	I don't think the problem is when the games are releasing. The problem is the game awards would
5503300	5508900	probably be better timed in January or February, but that's not what Jeff Keighley wants to do. And
5508900	5513380	that's not the vision that he has for the awards ceremony. And so that's how we end up in this
5513380	5517300	position. So I actually, I don't fault the publishers pushing their games for Game of the Year
5517300	5520820	and all this stuff, because you know, the games are going to release when they release. The game
5520820	5525940	awards ought to be in January or February if the public is to have more time to play them. But I,
5525940	5530660	I absolutely understand the frustration where it's like, well, if the public can vote on this,
5530660	5535700	how am I supposed to vote for something I haven't had time to play? And that's why I say, well,
5535700	5541620	it's good that the public's vote for all intents and purposes barely counts. Right?
5542580	5547860	Yeah. Anyway. But if we want to go again, if we want to look at the Oscars and the film industry
5547860	5552900	and that whole thing, this year is going to be very interesting. And I want to say it was
5552900	5556260	interesting. A couple of years ago, there was another movie that bucked the trend,
5556260	5562980	but there is still a lot of Oscar buzz. And in my opinion, 100% rightfully so around the movie,
5562980	5568500	Everything, Everywhere, All at Once. That movie came out way earlier this year. But I'm telling
5568500	5574580	you, if Michelle Yeoh does not get nominated for best actress, gays will be rioting in the streets
5574580	5581140	as will be, as will people of lots of orientations, because I think we can all agree,
5581140	5586820	she deserves an Oscar nomination. Quite frankly, Ki Hui Kwan who, you know, hasn't acted in a
5586820	5592420	movie in like 40 years or however long it's been. Also, I think a lot of people will be, you know,
5592420	5596020	throwing hands if he doesn't get a best supporting actor nomination for that movie.
5596020	5599220	So there's a lot of people that are wanting to go to bat for that movie.
5599220	5602100	It'll be interesting to see if it does get nominated or not. Because again,
5603060	5609060	those types of releases tend to get forgotten about. And that's the other frustration. Games
5609060	5615380	or movies that don't get nominated because they came out just after the cutoff. Quick aside,
5615380	5619300	sorry, but while I'm on this tangent, just looking at other industries, other war shows,
5619300	5625060	you know who else has a fucking weird cutoff window? The Grammys. Now, I can't stand the
5625060	5629140	Grammys personally. But the Grammy because I just they've been getting it wrong for years
5629140	5632980	and years and years. Go look at what The Weeknd said about the Grammys a few years ago, why he
5632980	5637700	doesn't participate. That's been true about the Grammys for a long time. They have a lot of things
5637700	5646580	to fix. But the Grammys also have a very strange cutoff window. And so like you have a situation
5646580	5653060	where a band that's near and dear to my heart, ABBA, got nominated last year for their comeback
5653060	5657380	single. So they got nominated for the single that came out in advance of their album.
5659620	5664900	They got nominated for that. But this year now they get nominated for the actual album
5664900	5669140	and a different single that I think more people actually enjoy. Don't Shut Me Down,
5669140	5673540	the one that actually sounded like an old ABBA song. Those got nominated for this year's Grammys.
5673540	5677140	ABBA will not, they didn't win last year and they won't win this year either because
5677140	5683540	Beyonce train is unstoppable period end of sentence. But it's interesting that they get
5683540	5690340	nominated essentially that that first song gets nominated, which is on that Voyage album and then
5690340	5695220	the second song gets nominated this year. So it's another one of those award shows that has a weird
5695220	5703620	ass cutoff date, for sure. So anyway, let's see Bobby Blackwell in chat says at the start of the
5703620	5707860	award season game publishers and developers are provided with an access to a list of outlets that
5707860	5712180	will submit nomination ballots. While most of our voting outlets have access to games through the
5712180	5716740	normal editorial process, publishers and developers are permitted to provide review copies or digital
5716740	5721380	redemption codes. To meet our balloting deadlines, publishers or developers may provide advance or
5721380	5726740	pre-release access to games for critical evaluation. I'm assuming that is copy posted for the website.
5726740	5731940	And that reads to me screener copies. Infamous in the movie industry, right, Loki?
5735140	5739060	I joke because Loki used to get a lot of screener copies. We used to watch a lot of
5739060	5746020	movies before they were out. Yes. So I mean, they have the annoying watermark on the bottom or
5746020	5749700	the other weird that some of them would go to black and white randomly. Like that was the
5749700	5754580	copy protection thing. But yeah, I remember watching so many movies before they were
5754660	5760260	released on DVD through that. Yep. So I remember that screener copies.
5761460	5767540	All right. Anyway, let's move on. We spent way too much time talking about awards. Sorry,
5767540	5770900	but I want to respond to this stuff in chat. That was some good, good feedback in chat.
5770900	5777140	All right. Let's talk about this next story, which I think is, Loki, are you doing this one? Sorry,
5777940	5789700	behind? Yeah, Loki's on it. Yeah, yeah. So this is cool. archive.org has now received all 285 issues
5789700	5798740	of Nintendo power, which was uploaded, I guess by gumball. And you can now view them unofficially
5799460	5806100	in CBR format, which is it's about 40 gigabytes might want to download that before it's already
5806100	5815460	gone. Oh, dang it. Yeah. Dang it. Nintendo. Well, I'm sure somebody right click saved all before
5816420	5819780	metaphorically. I mean, obviously, if it's been uploaded once on the internet,
5819780	5827060	there's a torrent out there. Absolutely. Yeah, well, yeah. In fact, Tiger Claw in chat says
5827060	5830580	the archive was taken down, but you can download them from a torrent that I linked to on the
5830580	5837300	discord, of course, of course. So you know, Nintendo, I mean, I don't know, since it was
5837300	5844500	your magazine, and all. You could put digital versions of this as part of the Nintendo online
5844500	5850100	service, and people could just browse them using their switch. It's like, almost no effort.
5850900	5857620	And in fact, somebody's done all the scanning work for you really, and it adds to the value
5857620	5863300	that you would get with Nintendo online. Just a thought, you know, just since you're going to be
5863300	5871140	litigious and take it down anyways. They won't. They won't. Of course, effort, minimal effort,
5871140	5875380	minimal effort. All right. Well, speaking of classics, we have the next segment for you.
5875380	5891620	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5891620	5896580	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
5897380	5902260	All right, except it's actually not going to be Dark Sakura talking about it tonight. It's going
5902260	5906500	to be me because I picked the game tonight because Dark Sakura's out of town. And unfortunately,
5906500	5911700	with everything that was going on, she did not have time to record something in advance. So,
5911700	5915780	I will be talking about the classic game tonight. And the game that I have picked tonight is a
5915780	5921780	NES game that I remember fondly called The Magic of Scheherazade. Or when I was a kid,
5921780	5925540	I used to mispronounce this all the time. As you might notice, mispronunciation has been a running
5925540	5932100	theme in my life. I think I used to call this Scheherazade. That's what I used to call this
5932100	5935860	game. Did anybody else ever play this game? And what did you got? Loki, did you ever play this
5935860	5940180	game? All right. Shane, have you ever heard of this game?
5940180	5941060	No, it was terrible.
5941060	5947220	Oh, no. This game, look, on a technical level, it wasn't great, but this game actually did some
5947220	5954820	really cool things I want to talk about. So, The Magic of Scheherazade, it was part action RPG and
5954820	5960820	part straight up RPG. And that's what made this game very unique. It was released in Japan in
5960820	5966820	1987, but it didn't come out in North America until 1990. So, there was actually quite a gap
5966820	5971700	in the time it took to get this game translated and localized. It was released by Culture Brain,
5972420	5977860	who did a lot of unique NES titles. And it's, of course, you can probably guess based on the name.
5977860	5983860	It's based on Middle Eastern folk tales from 1001 Nights. You are attempting to rescue the Princess
5983860	5989780	of Scheherazade from Sabaron, who, of course, has summoned demons, chaos, and all the bad things to
5989780	5994740	Arabia where this game takes place. The game is divided into chapter. And as I mentioned,
5994740	6001380	it is both action adventure RPG. Think The Legend of Zelda combined with more classic,
6001380	6008980	say, Dragon Warrior at the time, or Final Fantasy RPG style. So, you go through the overworld at a
6008980	6015140	top-down perspective. You can attack enemies with your sword and so forth, both in real-time action,
6015140	6019620	but sometimes there will be random turn-based battles that you fight with allies at your side.
6019620	6022980	Again, kind of like you're playing Dragon Warrior 2 or something like that.
6022980	6027380	I know why this game sounds familiar. Didn't Strong Bad write a song about this?
6028420	6033700	Oh, I don't know. Maybe. Somebody in chat might know. I don't know.
6035700	6037620	It just reminded me of Everybody to the Limit.
6038180	6043300	Yeah, looking at comments in chat. Darkstalkers actually in chat, hopefully gives a blessing to
6043300	6047060	this choice, says, and apparently gamble for corgis. Yes, that's what's happening in the
6047060	6050820	sequence we're watching right now, is that apparently there's a wheel of corgis and
6050820	6054500	penguins and other animals. There's a gambling mini-game that's going on in the game right now.
6054500	6060020	But it also just goes to show the amount of variety, which even though, yeah, it didn't
6060020	6065620	age well. The graphics kind of look like a hot mess. But at the time, to see all these different
6065620	6071220	genres combined in one game, that's what makes this game unique and worthy of a classic to me.
6071220	6075700	It's just, you know, we love when, like, genres get mishmashed together. Like,
6075700	6081060	look at one of our all-time faves, the Guardian Legend. That's like part Zelda, part Gradius,
6081060	6086020	or maybe, I'm sorry, yeah, Life Force, kind of combined into one game, because I'm thinking
6086020	6091300	vertical scrolling, combined into one game. So, that's kind of part of the reason why I think
6091860	6097540	this game is unique. Anyway, let's see. What else do I want to say about it? Enemies will appear in
6097540	6102500	the overworld. They're fought in real time. You can use a sword. You can use a rod for projectiles
6102500	6107620	and magic spells. You get experience points, of course, that increase your levels. HP and MP go
6107620	6112500	up as you level up. If you are transitioning between screens on the overhead map, sometimes
6112500	6117460	you will encounter a turn-based battle with groups of enemies. The start of the battle gives you the
6117460	6122180	option to fight, escape, or bribe enemies into leaving. That's also kind of a unique mechanic
6122180	6126420	at the time. You fight alone or with two other people in your party, and it's a little more like
6126420	6134260	a traditional RPG in that sense. Formations, which you learn at magic universities, can be created,
6134260	6140340	which give you added defense or cast powerful group magic spell. So, certain formations work
6140340	6146180	against certain squads or regiments in the game. You can also hire mercenary troopers. Again,
6146180	6151460	there's a lot going on in this game. So, it's just interesting that it doesn't do any of these
6151460	6156100	genres particularly well, but the fact that they fit all of this in one game is pretty impressive.
6156740	6161220	The Magic of Scheherazade was developed for the NES or the Famicom in Japan by Culture Brain.
6161860	6167780	A person that was working under a pseudonym, Academia Yuminisuke, was the game's producer.
6167780	6171780	That was in a weekly Famitsu interview that that came from. Composers for the game were
6171780	6179060	Akinora Sawa and Sunichi Mikame. Sawa worked on the Hiryu no Ken series with Culture Brain,
6179060	6183620	and Mikame worked on Kung Fu Heroes, which I saw someone shouted that out in chat also from
6183620	6190980	Culture Brain, and Flying Dragon. Compositions were recorded to audio cassette and then simplified
6190980	6195060	to the Famicom sound generator once it was approved by the producer. I think that's
6195060	6200420	interesting. Only three of the six songs that Mikame composed were used in the game. He left
6200420	6204820	the company before the game was actually released. There was an official strategy guide for the game
6204820	6210420	released in November of 1987. There was a short manga based on the game called Magical Book
6210420	6214340	that features all the party members from the game in it. Okay, I think I'm sick of watching
6214340	6217860	corgi gambling on our stream. We need to fast forward to a little more action. Looks like
6217860	6223060	there's a turn-based battle there. We can take a look at that. All right. Sorry, just I wanted
6223060	6229540	to adjust what our live viewers are seeing on Twitch. Let's see. Then what happened after that?
6229540	6235940	Culture Brain USA announced the game for mid-1988 with a release date then scheduled for January
6235940	6242340	1989. It was delayed, but it was showcased at the Winter CES with games like Kung Fu Heroes
6242340	6247860	and Flying Dragon The Secret Scroll. It was showcased then again at the 1990 Winter CES,
6247860	6254100	this time alongside Baseball Simulator 1.0, and the game finally came out on January 15, 1990.
6254100	6257780	Changes were made for the English language version, including animation of character and
6257780	6262980	monster sprites, changes of facial features for the characters to look a little more nondescript,
6262980	6269940	simplification of the overworld map, character text during gameplay, and new music. The reviews
6269940	6277140	when the game was released were mixed. EGM gave it a 22 out of 40. Famitsu gave it a 27 out of 40.
6277860	6282580	Video games and computer entertainment gave it a 6 out of 10. But the publication game players gave
6282580	6289300	it their best graphics award in 1989. So, it seemed like it was a little bit kind of what I
6289300	6295940	was saying earlier. The compliments were, wow, this game does a lot. The feedback on what it
6295940	6303540	could have done better is, wow, it does none of those things particularly well. So, and honestly,
6303540	6308740	I do agree, but I play, I rented this game. I never owned it, but I remember renting this from
6308740	6313700	the video store at least two or three times because I thought, you know, I liked RPGs,
6313700	6319860	I like Zelda, I like Final Fantasy, and I just thought, A, you didn't see a lot of games in like,
6319860	6325700	you know, this sort of universe, like the, you know, the Arabian kind of setting that this game
6325700	6329940	has. You see a lot of games like that and the uniqueness of those different, you know, I always
6329940	6335700	liked when game genres collided, like I mentioned the Guardian Legend, but also I think about things
6335700	6340900	like Goemon or The Legend of the Mystical Ninja and like the random shit you did in those games
6340900	6345460	when you, you know, like Gradius being built into the game was just like the weirdest thing. I
6345460	6351460	always liked that kind of stuff and they were always like fun games to rent. Anyway, what's
6351460	6356980	interesting is that you also know people that have kind of missed this game. This game has been
6356980	6362420	mentioned that it is noticeably absent from the Virtual Console service. You remember when Nintendo
6362420	6366900	was putting everything out on the Nintendo Wii, this game probably deserved another shot on that
6366900	6370340	service because like Kung Fu Heroes and some of the other Culture Brain stuff got released,
6370340	6376660	but not this one, which is interesting. A sequel to the game was planned. It was listed by Nintendo
6376660	6384100	for a 1990 release for the NES. The sequel was then noted in Game Pro in the September 1990
6384100	6388980	issue for the summer CES. It then came up in Nintendo Power, and now we can check the archives
6388980	6396100	to see it, in the November-December 1990 issue. At the winter CES in January 1992,
6396100	6401220	a Super Nintendo game called Golden Empire was announced by Culture Brain as a follow-up to
6401220	6407460	The Magic of Scheherazade. Then a year later, the 1993 winter CES, the game was apparently called
6407460	6413780	Golden Empire The Legend of Scheherazade. And then a gaming retail chain at the time,
6413780	6421700	Chips and Bits advertised the game. And as late as 1996, the Japanese magazine,
6421700	6428020	Family Computer Magazine, listed the game as Scheherazade Densetsu, the Prelude, with a
6428020	6433460	TBA sort of date. And of course, that's it. That's all we know. The game never came out.
6433460	6440020	So, it was mysteriously sacked. Just, I guess, was never really able to truly be finished. So,
6440660	6444740	Questbuster in chat brings up another fun fact, which I think this is neat. Magic of
6444740	6451860	Scheherazade broke into Nintendo Power's top 30 in the July and August issue in 1990 at number 15,
6451860	6459540	ahead of Willow, number 16, and just behind Dragon Warrior. Well, yeah, this game was incredibly
6459540	6463700	unique. And I think that's why a lot of people remember it. Again, not every game that gets
6463700	6469300	picked for the Classic Game of the Week is necessarily memorable because it was good. But
6469300	6473300	I think games that we remember fondly are games that kind of make us go, huh,
6473300	6478580	that was interesting, are certainly worthy. And to me, that's the Magic of Scheherazade,
6478580	6483540	a game that I think was very interesting in the way that it sort of mishmashed different genres.
6483540	6487860	So, I would encourage you to check this out. And unfortunately, there's no legal way to do it. So,
6487860	6491220	I'm going to have to tell you to turn to emulation to look at it, or, you know,
6491220	6494900	watch a long play on YouTube or something like that. But I think the game is interesting.
6495860	6500820	So, even though, yeah, it probably didn't age great, and you're probably going to be like,
6500820	6506740	oh, God, some of these graphics, like, you can see how the frames, I mean, if you think technical
6506740	6512340	problems in today's games are bad, check out some of the stuff on the NES. Anyway, there it is,
6512340	6516580	your Classic Game of the Week. Neither of you ever played that game?
6517220	6517780	I did not.
6517780	6519460	That's what I'm aware of.
6519460	6523540	Yeah, it was pretty, I liked it. It was unique. It was different. I try to remember if the
6523540	6527140	cartridge was different, too, because some of the Culture Brain cartridges were different.
6527700	6531380	But I don't think that one was. I don't recall it being so anyway.
6532420	6538340	All right. Dark Soccer will be back in two weeks, and she'll take over the Classic Game segment
6538340	6542820	again. So, I think this means next week, Loki, I think that means it's your turn next week.
6542820	6543540	Sound good?
6543540	6544580	Oh, boy.
6544580	6548980	Oh, boy. Don't pick anything that's going to get you in trouble. That's all I'm going to say.
6548980	6550820	Oh, I'm not picking Halo.
6550820	6553140	All right. Yeah, I was going to say, don't pick anything that's going to get you in trouble.
6553780	6561700	Don't pick Halo 2 either. All right. All right. I'm sure there's lots of games,
6561700	6566580	10 years or older, that are Loki noteworthy. Hell, God, the original Saints Row probably
6566580	6567780	qualified at this point.
6567780	6568980	Maybe we did that one.
6568980	6570660	Oh, did we? All right. Well, fair enough.
6570660	6571780	Maybe. I don't know.
6571780	6577780	All right. Check the wiki. All right. Let's go now to some rapid fire news and travel
6577780	6581060	around the industry and look at some other headlines pretty quickly here.
6581060	6585940	So, oh, dark soccer in chat says new OLR dream game, corky gambling.
6585940	6593620	I'm kind of into it. Like dogs playing poker. I'm kind of into it. It's cute. All right. Anyway,
6593620	6595300	rapid fire news. Loki, let's go to you.
6596500	6605460	Yeah. So, apparently, Las Vegas Raiders linebacker Blake Martinez has decided to retire mid season
6606020	6612660	because he is making enough money selling Pokemon cards that he can retire. In fact,
6612660	6624260	he just recently sold an illustrator, Pikachu, that was a mint 9.5, and he sold that for $672,000.
6626180	6629860	So, he's making money selling Pokemon cards. No need to play football anymore.
6629860	6633380	That's interesting. Not a headline I would have thought.
6634020	6638660	There's a lot of football players that make more money than that, but I guess, you know,
6638660	6642180	for the average football player, that's probably better than the salary.
6642180	6648020	He's only 28, too. So, I mean, like, he probably has quite a bit of time that he could, you know.
6648660	6652980	He's got to invest that money. I mean, when all is said and done, $600,000 is going to last,
6652980	6655540	but maybe combined with the NFL money, it's pretty good.
6655540	6660740	Or maybe that's just one card out of all the ones he's selling. I don't know how big he is in that.
6660740	6663860	Shane, haven't you been getting more into the card game a little bit or at
6663860	6668420	least collecting the different cards? Only for the ones I care about. Like,
6668420	6673140	I don't do it for, like, the rare expensive ones. I do it for the Oshawott cards or
6673860	6677220	one that I think looks cool. Or the soon to be released
6677220	6678900	Quaxley cards, I'm sure. Yes.
6679780	6686100	Fair enough. All right. What else, Logie? Apparently, Blizzard is keen on selling
6686100	6690820	Overwatch 2 skins for players they have temporarily disabled. So you can buy
6690820	6696900	a brand new skin for Mei. However, because they've temporarily disabled her because of
6696900	6703220	her ice wall ability and the bug in that, you can't play with the new skin.
6704420	6710340	But they're apparently bringing her back. Well, they apparently already have brought her back
6710340	6717060	or was supposed to bring her back by November 15th. But it has also been delayed because
6717060	6724260	of a issue in the launch of the patch to address a critical issue so soon.
6725380	6729380	Have to be honest. I haven't really touched Overwatch 2 since that first week. And now it's
6729380	6734340	just kind of there. So I don't know. I haven't been following the latest and greatest of the game,
6734340	6740500	but it'll be interesting to see if the, I guess, like all the hype that was there that
6740500	6744180	first week would Overwatch 2 launch, like how much of that is still there around the holidays,
6744180	6747300	you know, as we get in towards the end of the year and next year and season two
6747300	6750260	Battle Pass really will be the real telling thing. Because that's where they're making
6750260	6754980	their money now, right? Yeah. Speaking of Blizzard, even though we didn't have it show
6754980	6758260	rolled, Shane, you had brought something to me up before the show tonight. And I was like,
6758260	6760980	Oh, yeah, maybe we should bring that up. Did you want to talk about that?
6760980	6769620	Oh, yeah, sure. So starting January 23 of next year, all Blizzard games, all the major ones,
6769620	6775860	except for Diablo Immortal will have their services suspended in China, even though they're
6775860	6781860	about to sell like the new WoW expansion and the next season of Overwatch 2 is going to happen.
6782820	6788180	I guess they couldn't come to an agreement with NetEase, their China partner. And so those
6788180	6793060	services are just going to go away. So I don't know what that means for like, the Chinese
6793060	6799220	Overwatch League teams, or, you know, all the players there, they are, can they use VPNs? I
6799220	6804100	don't know how strict it is. But they're kind of out of luck, for at least the time being.
6805300	6811460	Blizzard said something about being willing to revisit like their games in the future there,
6811460	6815220	but doesn't sound like it's going to be anytime soon. Interesting. I wonder if they'll team up
6815220	6819300	with a different publisher, but then you got to wonder how the Chinese gaming community is going
6819300	6822740	to react to this. Because I imagine there's going to be a lot of people over there that are going
6822740	6830820	to be like, well, fuck Blizzard then, you know? Yeah, maybe. I know Immortal was made with NetEase.
6830820	6836660	So they still have some sort of relationship, but I do not understand what happened to,
6837380	6840980	you know, effectively kill their entire lineup there.
6840980	6848260	Yeah, that's a, that's a big, that's a big, you know, like, failing, really, of them not
6848260	6852820	be able to renegotiate the agreement, especially when they're not like turning around and saying,
6852820	6856900	and we're going to this publisher and set instead, like Blizzard did not have a second suitor lined
6856900	6862020	up. So it's a really odd thing to just have suddenly terminate, you know? Yeah, it's especially
6862580	6869140	when they went all in on that one controversy on Overwatch, like, now they're like, whatever,
6869140	6874500	we don't need China. We don't care. As Joe and Matt in chat says, the line to say F you to
6874500	6879620	Blizzard goes around the block. Well, yeah, with this in China, this news, this is not going to go
6879620	6884100	over well, I'm sure. God, can you imagine like all that time that some people have been investing
6884100	6889300	into their profiles like a wow character? Can you imagine, Shane, if like, they came out tomorrow
6889300	6893300	and said, you know what, due to a disagreement with Square Enix, we're just turning off Final
6893300	6900900	Fantasy 14 in America next month, like crazy, that would be awful. I mean, you were onto it,
6900900	6907220	there'd be so many people that would be like, private servers, VPN, actually, I heard about
6907220	6912340	a private Final Fantasy 11 server that just I've heard about, I've actually been on them before,
6912340	6918420	like, there's some new one that just launched, because they're one of my LGBT gaming servers
6919060	6923300	was recruiting for a link shell and that and I was actually tempted. Like, again, it's one of
6923300	6929140	those things where it's like, if you didn't go live the same day as Pokemon, I would have been
6929140	6937060	tempted by this. Yeah, it was. What were you saying? I don't want to be dragged back into
6937060	6941940	a Final Fantasy 11. Again, I know, I know. But something needs to be done on the fun, though,
6941940	6947220	I did play on a mod server for a brief period of time. And they had the level they had, like,
6947220	6952660	basically, it was like a 30 x leveling or something like that. So you got 30 x XP from
6952660	6956260	everything. It was great, because you could like solo a whole bunch of stuff you wouldn't normally
6956260	6961620	be able to. I would go look up the name of this, but it's in Discord. And Discord is how I'm
6961620	6966740	putting your face through to the stream right now. So I can't switch windows. But I'm, I'll have to
6966740	6971460	look it up after the show and send it, you know, but again, not that like I could send I could
6971460	6976660	send something Final Fantasy 11 or 14 to Shane and it's like until the Pokedex is done. She doesn't
6976660	6981700	have time for anything else, right? It's very true. Except maybe rating because there's this,
6981700	6987700	there's a social contract with rating, but that's really it. So all right, moving on. Let's talk
6987700	6995860	about some DLC that is incoming for Splatoon 3. More content and stuff for Splatoon 3 this
6995860	7000740	December. Starting on December 1, if you have an active Nintendo Switch Online membership,
7000740	7006420	you're going to get Chill Season 2022. That's weapon and stages, new gear, victory emotes,
7006420	7013780	game modes. And there's a video that has all of that as well. Big Run is coming. It puts a twist
7013780	7020020	in Salmon Run. Big Run is going to take place when the Salmonoids invade the Wahoo world stage later
7020020	7025300	this year. And there'll be more details that come out soon. There's also going to be X Battles where
7025300	7029700	you have to get to an elite rank in anarchy battles and you risk X power to challenge your
7029700	7033940	way up the leaderboards. X Battles are coming out December 1 as well. Three new weapons,
7033940	7039940	a new roller, a new charger, new shooter, and 10 returning weapons from previous Splatoon games.
7039940	7045140	And now some of them have modified sets. There will also be new stages added, including
7045940	7053860	Brine Water Springs and Flounder Heights from the first Splatoon game. So more fun stuff there. But
7053860	7058020	again, you have to have a Nintendo Switch Online. I don't know, is that premium online or is that
7058020	7069940	just any online? If you're getting the DLC, it's probably the premium one. It depends on how they
7069940	7076740	term the DLC. If it's DLC, then it's going to require purchasing. But it sounds to me mostly
7076740	7081140	just like a title update. It does sound like a title update, doesn't it? Which should be free.
7081140	7085300	Because again, things like new stages and stuff, they're going to go into the rotation for everyone.
7085300	7089380	You can't just have DLC. Only people get those stages. So I feel like a lot of that's going to
7089380	7093380	just be open for everyone. But I can see how you have to have Nintendo Switch Online to do it
7093380	7099460	because those are all things that you play online. Yeah. And it's... Right. That's why I would think
7099460	7104660	it would be the expansion pass if they are going to actual DLC route and not just like a patch.
7104660	7109300	Yeah. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some things
7109300	7115460	you'll be able to play this week. Although I think now we're going to... Yeah. Black Friday
7115460	7121300	is this Friday. And so games usually don't release on Black Friday. Although there might be some
7121300	7126340	digital surprises. I don't know, but let's check in anyway. Yeah. So we've got Evil West,
7126340	7132740	which is out on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. Five Nights at Freddy's
7132740	7142100	Security Breach on Xbox One and Xbox Series. Gungrave Gore on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,
7142100	7148980	Xbox One and Xbox Series. And last but not least, Ship of Fools on PC, Nintendo Switch,
7148980	7153940	PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series. All right. And if you pull up the year updates for me while I do
7153940	7158100	Japan... Of course, I already did it. Awesome. I'm already on top of this. Thank you. I'm right on
7158100	7162980	top of that, Rose. Anyway, looking to Japan, which obviously it's a little different because
7162980	7167540	Thanksgiving is not a factor over there. So they do have some releases this week on the Nintendo
7167540	7171860	Switch. The Binding of Isaac Repentance gets its Japanese release, although the game is still in
7171860	7179460	English, but it is getting released officially in Japan. Kono Subarashi Sekai ni Shuku Fukuo
7179460	7184820	also comes out this week in a regular and a limited edition. We also have a game called
7184820	7191060	Harvest Over Ray is out on the Switch this week. Matchpoints Tennis Championships is also out this
7191060	7196740	week in Japan. And then Omori is out, also an English game, but they are putting it out
7197300	7206740	anyway in Japan this week. And a price reduction for several games in the Fushigi no Gensokyo
7207140	7215780	series, including Reloaded and Lotus Labyrinth R. Also of interest, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl
7216580	7221860	is released in Japan this week, which is interesting. So that is all out this week in Japan.
7221860	7228900	Going over to the PlayStation 5 and checking out the releases there, Solstice, not to be confused
7228900	7233300	with the amazing NES classic that I'm sure I've picked as the classic game of the week at some
7233300	7240260	point. This is a different game. It's called S-O-U-L, Solstice, which I don't know much about this
7240260	7244740	game, but it looks like it has some neat graphics to it. So that's kind of neat. So that is out on
7244740	7249860	the PlayStation 5 this week. And that seems to be the major release over there. Now we can go to
7249860	7256420	Europe. All right. In Europe, we've got Evil West coming out on PlayStation and Xbox, Farming
7256420	7267460	Simulator 22 Platinum Edition on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, Gungrave Gore on PlayStation and Xbox,
7267460	7273220	and of course Just Dance 2023 Edition on PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.
7274500	7278100	All right. All right. We have a few more stories and then we'll invite some calls. We'll see if
7278100	7286340	anyone wants to call in tonight over at our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord if you
7286340	7293060	want to be a part of the show tonight. In the meantime, let's get some more news. Loki, a game
7293060	7300420	we were talking about earlier, right? Yes. Morio Kishimoto, who is the game director and designer
7300420	7309140	on Sonic Team. He has let everybody know that there's basically that the new sequel of Sonic
7309140	7316980	or Sonic Frontiers has areas which were not quite there yet. That's pretty obvious. It was pretty
7316980	7324100	empty. And that they're treating the feedback that players are leaving them right now like a
7324100	7330020	global play test. Now that's not to be confused with we're treating the release of this game like
7330020	7335300	a global play test, but more like that they are taking feedback seriously because I know I read
7335300	7340020	it the other way the first time. I'm like, oh, how nice pay $60 for your game. And we're just going
7340020	7344420	to be play testing it, I guess. But I mean, that is kind of what it is in the sense that
7346340	7349620	a lot of the stuff really should have been polished, like especially some of the pop in
7349620	7355940	that's in this case that a game that is about speed and the pop in is so bad that you miss
7355940	7364660	stuff. That is a problem. Whether they're going to patch it, I don't know. Hopefully,
7364660	7370100	hopefully they can fix it. But at the very least, they're going to take what they've learned from
7370100	7377060	previous games that have performed poorly, technically, and apply that to the next game
7377060	7380660	that they make. And I'm sure that we won't ever have these problems again, Pokemon.
7381220	7385860	Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm sure game freak is breathing a sigh of relief. It's not just us.
7388580	7392980	We're all in this together. That's that's the industry nowadays. Like it literally is
7392980	7399700	acceptable for them to put out broken products. Can you imagine if that were to be like any other
7399700	7407540	industry like cars or planes? Or movies? The movies just miss? Well, okay. But remember when
7407540	7412180	the Cats movie came out and like the CGI like there were pieces of it that like weren't done?
7413220	7416580	Yeah. So that actually I was like, Oh, actually, it does happen in movies.
7416580	7423780	Like they did as much as they could. So anyway, but I didn't know when I saw I didn't notice any
7423780	7430980	of that when I saw it finished the CG on the rest of it. So, you know. All right. Anyhow, moving on
7430980	7436500	to a story that was submitted via our discord because in our chat over at Orange Lounge Radio,
7436500	7441220	you all can send us some stories for potential inclusion in our show. And I do I do read
7441220	7447220	everything in our chat, even if I don't always chat. But there was a story that was posted
7447220	7452260	about scalper bots and the PlayStation five apparently scalper bots are starting to lose
7452260	7457220	interest in the PlayStation five. This is according to a bot detection specialist,
7457860	7462260	net Asia. I don't know if I'm saying that right. But it's a quarterly index on the top five
7462260	7467780	products that are targeted by scalper bots. And for the third quarter of 2022, the PlayStation
7467780	7473700	five is no longer in the top three. We know where they went to number four or swift tickets.
7474580	7478340	No, it wasn't even because this is the third quarter. So Taylor Swift actually in the fourth
7478340	7483300	quarter. And that's a that's a fourth. That is a whole other disaster. Can you believe?
7483300	7490580	Can you believe? Because like, can you believe Congress is finally going to investigate ticket
7490580	7496900	master? Like the government is going to and it took Taylor Swift to make that happen. Like I,
7496900	7502260	I don't consider myself a Swifty. But damn her power. Like I respect your music. I like some
7502260	7509220	of her songs. I do like I understand why people are a Swifty. But like, damn her power to like,
7509220	7515780	be able to shut down Ticketmaster. Break them out. Something we've been yelling about for years.
7515780	7519140	We'll see that actually happens. Yeah, we'll see if it actually happens. That's for sure.
7519140	7526260	All right. Anyhow, um, are you curious what outranked the PlayStation five? Number one,
7526260	7533220	Adidas Yeezy slide bone. Number two, Nike Dunk Low Panda, of course, their shoes.
7534020	7540900	Sometimes we forget, because we're kind of tunnel vision on video games. We forget the shoe industry
7540900	7547780	is fucking wild. Sometimes. Is there anybody out there in chat that participates in shoe collection?
7547780	7553220	Because I remember just a couple weeks ago, I was in San Francisco, walking around for
7553220	7556340	something completely unrelated. I was there. Oh, it was when I went and saw Jackie Little
7556340	7559940	Pill with melody. And I was waiting for her to show up. And I was walking by the store. And I
7559940	7564740	was like, why is there a gigantic fucking line to go in this store that looks almost absolutely
7564740	7569380	empty shoes? It was a shoe release of some sort. And they were all going in there to get shoes.
7569940	7577460	And it was probably one of these, to be honest. All right. Um, let's see. And then number three,
7578260	7584900	Panini Donruss Optic football trading cards. What the fuck are those? Optic, is that like,
7585620	7590740	trading cards with NFCs built, not NFT, NFCs built in were like, you can scan them and stuff,
7590740	7594980	because that's where like, that's what it sounds like. It's wild.
7594980	7597460	I thought at first it was gonna be sandwiches. Like, damn.
7597460	7600500	Yeah, I know. When I saw Panini, I was like, oh, like a press like, damn,
7600500	7607380	that must be a hell of a thing. But yeah, no, they look like just normal old football cards.
7607540	7613140	Interesting. Maybe somebody in chat knows more about that. But those are more desirable
7613140	7617700	than PlayStation five. Mike Deaf says those are popular worldwide, the Panini cards.
7618580	7626980	So, and the sandwiches. And in Pokemon, sandwiches are an important plot point in Pokemon.
7626980	7632020	That's how you get Pokemon to breed now, is through sandwiches. It is.
7632980	7637700	It's true, you go to the picnic. So that's right, you you set up a romantic picnic for
7637700	7646500	two Pokemon, and then there's eggs. No more nurseries. So there's another difference
7646500	7653300	from previous generations. Oh, Mike Deaf points out every World Cup they release a set. These
7653300	7658020	are actual like the one at least the ones I googled were showing us American football,
7658020	7661780	but that would make a lot of sense that they might be worldwide more what we know as soccer,
7661780	7667380	but what the rest of the world knows as football. It might might make sense. It's more related in
7667380	7672660	that universe. So interesting. You know, I I'm getting to a point where I'm like, yeah, I think
7672660	7677540	I'd kind of like to have a PlayStation five. Maybe that'll be a holiday thing. I don't know. Alan was
7677540	7681380	kind of asking some probing questions around us. I don't know if that's I've seen them in stores
7681380	7686740	now. They're not that bad. Yeah. Yeah. To get. So maybe maybe that'll be a holiday thing. I don't
7686740	7691140	know. But if it's not, I'm like, okay with that. Like if it's because they are still expensive.
7691140	7695380	So if it's something that has to wait until a little closer to June or whenever Final Fantasy
7695940	7701460	fifth, not 15, Final Fantasy 16 is releasing, then, you know, so be it. It's fine.
7702820	7706660	All right, moving on. Let's talk about what's happening in Microsoft's world, Loki.
7707380	7712500	They're banning people. So their digital transparency report came out,
7712500	7720660	and apparently their automatic banning system to catch inauthentic accounts and
7720740	7727300	cheating accounts has banned nearly four point three three million of those accounts.
7727860	7735940	And they claim that ninety nine point nine nine percent of the time it automatically bans fake
7735940	7742100	accounts as soon as they're created and that their automation helps find resolutions sooner,
7743060	7749540	reduce the needs for human review and further reduce the impact of toxic content in human
7751140	7759380	monitors. Yeah, that's curious to see. I'm curious to see what the, you know,
7760580	7764420	landscape looks like in multiplayer. I haven't really played in public multiplayer games and
7766500	7773860	it's probably coming up on a decade now, more than a decade. I don't know. So be curious to see
7773860	7779700	like if that's changing like the landscape or if it's still, you know, that one percent of
7779700	7786100	a-holes that manages to get through. Yeah. And I feel like every time you have a cheating
7786100	7789540	embodying ban, then they just find a new way around it. Like, you know, it's it's going to
7789540	7794100	be a forever game of whack-a-mole forever and ever. You know, that's what it is pretty much.
7794660	7799380	All right. And lastly, this is kind of an interesting story because I wasn't aware
7799380	7803460	that this was something that was being worked on even at some point. But this is a story about
7803460	7813700	SimCopter64. So SimCopter64 was a sequel to, of course, SimCopter that was being worked on for,
7814340	7818020	sorry, I'm trying to get some of the b-roll up here. I'm doing it a little on the fly here.
7818660	7822980	But for those that are watching live over at twitch.tv slash vog network as we tape
7822980	7826900	live on Sunday night, I was just trying to get some of the video up for you. There we go.
7826900	7834580	So this is a version of SimCopter64 that was playable at E3 in 1997. It was going to be a
7834580	7840900	sequel to the original SimCopter game that was on the PC. In this title, you flew a helicopter
7840900	7846180	around your own SimCity. And that's what you're seeing pretty much in this Nintendo 64 version,
7846180	7852900	although it is really interesting to me in this footage, how they use a fog effect to like,
7852900	7856820	not have to render things on the entire screen. But you know, okay, all right.
7856820	7862900	We see what you do in fact in Nintendo 64 is pretty much is every game had a fog effect.
7862900	7867700	Yeah, well, maybe the new Pokemon game needed a fog effect. I don't know. But anyway,
7869220	7874980	anyway, this new footage was captured directly from a Nintendo 64 from the Video Game History
7874980	7880820	Foundation, who was able to find that E3 demo that was only ever seen in 1997. They've also written
7880820	7886580	a big article if you want to see it gamehistory.org is their website. Apparently, there was a lot of
7886580	7891620	difficulty in making a game that was fun to play and worked well on the hardware, you know, and
7891620	7895700	I'm joking about the fog effect. But let's be real, that was really going to annoy a lot of
7895700	7902820	people with that. So yeah, pretty neat that, yeah, I like seeing, you know, kind of the old stuff
7902820	7907460	that pops up again, and you know, this stuff that otherwise would have been lost to time.
7908020	7912660	But yeah, I'm sure if this had actually come out, it probably would not have been very well
7912660	7917140	received. But kind of neat. I didn't even really know that I didn't realize that they were even
7917140	7923060	working on one. I remember the original game. There were so many sim games in that era. That
7923060	7927860	was like that was the era of SimAnt, which I think you were playing on your background a few weeks
7927860	7937380	ago. SimTower, SimCopter, SimEarth, SimCity 3000, I think was probably in that same time frame.
7938100	7942980	There was just a ton of SimCity games that were all released at once, or sim-based games before
7942980	7948020	we actually got, of course, The Sims, which then, you know, pretty much transformed those games
7948020	7955620	forever. So Bobby Lachlvenchat says, I remember playing this at my first E3. I was totally more
7955620	7959940	interested in SimCity 3000. Actually, I don't think I played it. I think it was guided by an
7959940	7965460	employee so they wouldn't clip into buildings. But there was one TV that had this demo on it,
7965460	7972020	SimCity 3000 was the big thing in EA's booth that year. And SSG100 Matt throwing it back to another
7972020	7976900	all time classic that was released around that time, SimCity Action News Simulator,
7978980	7985060	which of course is a reference to the SimCity CD-ROM game that actually had cutscenes of
7985060	7991620	SimCity Action News that would report on the disasters. It was it was like public access
7991620	7996980	television, community theater, absolute camp, these things. I know we've made fun of it on the
7996980	8002100	show before, but I'm glad that end joke is still around out there. I got to find a copy of that
8002100	8007140	game and stream it sometime. It has to be out there in some type of like abandoned archive or
8007140	8015940	something somewhere. So, all right. That's it for our scheduled news tonight. If you would, oh,
8015940	8022420	see, I got the cost. If you would like to call in, you can do that over at twitch, excuse me,
8022420	8027380	well twitch.tv slash vog network if you'd like to ask us a question. But vog network.com slash
8027380	8031860	discord if you'd like to actually give us a call, you can head on into our green room. I was going
8031860	8037540	to check the mailbag. But I don't think I remember seeing anything in there. But I'll look in there
8037540	8043060	right now and see. In the meantime, let me check with Loki and see if there's any last minute
8043060	8051700	stories. I just looked. Nothing. Nothing. Shane, is there anything else that you saw in the news
8051700	8055220	this week that you want to talk about that we haven't gotten to yet? No, I've been paying
8055220	8060180	attention because you know, Pokemon. So if it's not Pokemon related, I wouldn't know what's
8060180	8064180	happening. What are you are you just working on your decks in that game? Basically? Yeah.
8065300	8072740	That's gonna take a long time. I feel like I see. I see. All right. Anyway, let's see the usual
8072740	8078020	places not letting me log in. So let me see if I can find because they all go about halfway done.
8078020	8085380	It says I'm at 195. That's not terrible. That's actually not as many Pokemon as I was expect you
8085380	8091540	to have to have beaten the game. That's only caught it says I've battled like 300 something
8091540	8097940	different ones. So okay. Well, I'll work out how long before I get the Scarlet exclusives that you
8097940	8101860	want. Or did you already take care of that? No, I haven't taken care of it yet. All right. Well,
8101860	8106900	I'll work on it. I can't I can't promise I'll stream tonight. But maybe I'm not I'm not going
8106900	8110820	to do like a post show thing like dark soccer usually does because I need a minute to like
8110820	8114900	actually edit this show. If I do anything, it'll be late night and only for a little bit. But
8116500	8122660	hopefully I can get to those areas soon. So. All right. Well, I guess with that,
8122660	8126420	we're at the point where we're going to wrap up the show. But before we wrap up the show,
8126420	8129460	let's get everybody's final thoughts. Actually, that did end up being a longer show than I would
8129460	8133380	have thought. Because we had a lot to say, I guess. So let's go right to get everybody's
8133380	8136740	final thought for the night. Hey, Shane, thank you so much for being here and filling in tonight
8136740	8141620	and coming in to talk about Pokemon. Really appreciate that and hope you had a good time.
8142580	8146100	You're welcome. Thank you. Before I get your final thought, let me remind our listeners,
8146100	8150100	of course, as always, thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio. If you enjoyed what you
8150100	8153540	heard here at the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a
8153540	8158180	voice. But we need the voices here to put out on air. So tell a friend or two about the show.
8158820	8163460	Help us spread the word. A five-star review wherever you found this podcast on a site like
8163460	8168500	iTunes or Spotify goes an awful long way. So we really appreciate it. As I was saying at the
8168500	8173060	beginning of the show, and obviously, I was pretty emotional about a lot of things. And thank you,
8173060	8176580	talking about video games has been very good for my mood tonight and just being with you all.
8176580	8182020	But obviously, there's a real community here that we built up over the past few years,
8182020	8184740	and we'd love for more people to join our community. And obviously,
8185380	8190260	when we lose somebody from that community, and I'm not talking about somebody just deciding they
8190260	8193380	have something better to do on Sunday nights, but we really lose somebody from the community.
8193380	8198100	Obviously, it really hurts. We are a family of sorts here on Sunday nights. So just really
8198100	8202180	appreciate those of you that turn out. And of course, that extends to absolutely every one of
8202180	8206900	you that listens throughout the week on the podcast feed as well. I am well aware due to time
8206900	8211300	zones for many of you overseas or just due to the fact that there's a lot that goes on in the world
8211380	8215140	on Sunday nights. Some of you listen on the podcast feed throughout the week,
8215140	8219620	and that is totally cool too. You are absolutely a part of this just as much as everyone else.
8219620	8224900	Please make sure we hear from you once in a while, either over at our mailbag. I almost said that
8224900	8229620	social media site I don't use anymore. Technically, we're there, but you'll have to pay me to check
8229620	8234340	it. Mailbag at orange, or excuse me, participate. I don't even know our fucking email address
8234340	8238580	anymore. Participate at orange.radio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
8238580	8242500	Okay, all of that being said, now I'll go to Shane. Shane, your final thought for us tonight?
8243540	8249860	Um, the new Pokemon games are really good. If you don't care about like bugs that are not game
8249860	8254580	breaking, please go get them. You'll have a lot of fun if you especially if you know a few other
8254580	8258580	people to play with and you just want to roam around in the world. It's one of the coolest
8259220	8264740	Pokemon experiences I've ever had. Yeah, I'm excited. I'm excited captures that same like
8264740	8269060	go feeling. You know, when go is new, we were all out like in downtown sack,
8269060	8274340	walking around, or old town sack. Like, I know you only get three other people with you and
8274340	8278900	you kind of got to know and you have to know who they are to be invited. But it's a lot of fun
8278900	8284020	still. I am excited to get to the point of that game where that feels a little more realistic,
8284020	8287700	realistic to do. I kind of feel like that's not something you really do until either like you've
8287700	8291220	beaten the game or you're really close. Like it's not something you should really do in the
8291220	8295700	beginning. But I mean, I guess there's no rules on it. But I just feel for me like,
8295700	8300180	oh, I should kind of focus on like progress and progression before I play with other players. I
8300180	8308500	don't know. Is that a fair outlook? Um, I think so non spoilery, the progression that should matter
8308500	8316260	to most people, if you want to go explore everything is do the Titan battles. Those
8316260	8322820	are most important other things. I understand why. Yeah. Um, but yeah, no, just do what you
8322820	8330820	want in the game. That's what it's billed as. So don't run around with people. Just focus like I
8330820	8336340	did. And you'll have a great time regardless. All right. All right. Loki, your final thoughts
8336340	8342740	tonight. I'll simulate your three is awesome. Go play it. All right. Sounds good. And my final
8342740	8347060	thought tonight is, um, thank you all very much for being here. Thank you for listening.
8347060	8352180	I appreciate you. I hope you all had a good 20 November. I know it wasn't great in the rest of
8352180	8359460	the world. Um, but you know, it's, it's, it's a, it's today's date is a good symbol of community.
8359460	8363940	And that's what we've got here. And that's what we've got to get us through a lot of these shitty
8363940	8367940	things that happen in the world. Um, not just this community, but many other communities,
8367940	8373140	Twitch streamer communities that you have out there. Um, maybe religious affiliated communities
8373140	8377700	you participate with in your spare time or other community based communities, uh, you know, real
8377700	8381860	world, uh, in real life things or other online communities, role-playing game communities,
8381860	8388020	whatever it is MMOs, whatever it is, uh, 20 November is definitely a symbol of a community
8388020	8391220	and, uh, what's going to get us through all the bullshit that happens in the world.
8391220	8394340	So on that note, I hope you all have an incredible week. We'll see you in seven
8394340	8398980	days on 27 November to do this all over again. Have a great Thanksgiving. Those of you in the
8398980	8405540	States be safe. Uh, and we'll see you next time. Bye everyone. You've been listening to orange
